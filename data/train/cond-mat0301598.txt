    "the properties of close - packed noble and transition metal surfaces have been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "the research has made great advances since the introduction of new experimental techniques , in particular scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , and the improvement of first - principle computational methods based on the density functional approach .",
    "these surfaces show a wide variety of behavior with respect to reconstruction , preferred site and strength of chemisorption of reactive species , adsorbate diffusion , etc .    owing to the abrupt change of the electronic structure on metal surfaces the first layer of atoms may have rather different properties from the bulk",
    ". often , a large intrinsic tensile surface stress appears , which is the driving force leading to compressive reconstruction on many close - packed metal surfaces .",
    "the stability of a particular surface is the result of the interplay of several physical quantities characteristic of surface , such as surface energy , surface stress , interatomic force constants , etc .",
    "the reconstruction is more likely to occur the larger the intrinsic stress and the smaller the energy for sliding the atoms of the first layers into positions out of registry with the substrate .    in this paper",
    "we consider ( 111 ) surfaces of copper , platinum , and gold .",
    "the au(111 ) surface reconstructs forming a uniaxially compressed layer , which can be seen in stm experiments.@xcite the pt(111 ) reconstructs only at high temperatures,@xcite or in the presence of saturated pt vapour,@xcite and cu(111 ) does not reconstruct .",
    "we report on first - principle numerical calculations of the properties of these surfaces using the density functional theory ( dft ) . in sec .",
    "[ calculation ] we first describe the generalities of the computation procedure .",
    "we then calculate the important physical quantities , such as the effective force constants in the first layer , the surface energies , and the intrinsic surface stress . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] we use these quantities in order to estimate the stability of the first layer of atoms with respect to a quasi - one - dimensional reconstruction , which can be treated theoretically by the frenkel - kontorova model . in the sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we discuss the results .",
    "the reconstructed phase of some close - packed metal surfaces may have a periodicity which involves many surface atoms .",
    "for example , the reconstruction of au(111 ) , one of the surfaces considered in this paper , involves a uniaxially compressed first atomic layer with a period of around 70   .",
    "full first - principle calculations with such large supercells are not feasible .",
    "one instead evaluates the stability by calculating the relevant quantities of the unreconstructed surface , and uses them in phenomenological models of reconstruction .",
    "there have been a number of papers in which the stability of ( 111 ) surfaces of noble metals was evaluated using the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model@xcite of uniaxially compressive reconstruction .",
    "ravelo and el - batanouny ( ref .",
    ", see also references therein ) have constructed effective potentials between surface atoms and performed molecular - dynamics simulations of the reconstructed phase . mansfiled and needs@xcite have derived conditions of stability of ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces towards a compressive reconstruction in the fk model , and evaluated it for several metals .",
    "apparently , their values of the parameters are not good enough , as they have found no reconstruction of pt(111 ) and au(111 ) .",
    "in particular , the strength of the interatomic potentials seems to be overestimated .",
    "takeuchi et al.@xcite have constructed a two - dimensional potential between first- and second - layer atoms of a au(111 ) surface using the results of first - principle calculations .",
    "they have calculated the reconstruction pattern using simulation techniques in a two - dimensional fk model .",
    "using the two - dimensional potential in a molecular - dynamics simulation , narasimhan and vanderbilt@xcite have concluded that the herringbone pattern of the reconstruction stripes observed on au(111 ) is favored by the long - range elastic interactions mediated by the substrate .",
    "recently , narasimhan and pushpa@xcite have studied a two - dimensional fk model of the pt(111 ) surface for which the parameters have been obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "they have obtained simulated stm images of the reconstruction stripes recombining and intersecting in various ways , similarly to the structures observed in stm experiments .",
    "the aim of this paper is to re - evaluate with highest accuracy the properties of the surfaces which determine the stability towards reconstruction . in this section",
    "we report on such calculations for the ( 111 ) surfaces of au , pt , and cu in the density functional theory ( dft ) approach . in the following subsections",
    "we describe , in order , the generalities of the numerical calculations , the calculation of surface energies , surface stress , surface spring constants , and the calculation of energy required to slide the complete first layer to various positions away from the most stable one . in the next section we use these results as input parameters in the ( effectively one - dimensional ) frenkel - kontorova model of uniaxially compressive reconstruction .",
    "we have performed first - principle calculations of the electronic structure of ( 111 ) surfaces within the density functional theory approach , using the _ dacapo _ program.@xcite we have used the provided ultrasoft pseudopotentials for the perdew - wang exchange - correlation functional pw91 and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "we have first made calculations for bulk metal , in order to determine the lattice constant at which the energy per atom is minimum , using the primitive fcc unit cell .",
    "the lattice constant found often differs slightly from the experimental value : for example , our value is 4.00   compared with the experimental value 3.92   for pt , 4.18   compared with the experimental value 4.08   for au , and 3.66   compared with 3.61   for cu .",
    "we have followed the common practice using the computed value of the lattice constant in susequent calculations , which ensures that no spurious bulk stresses appear .",
    "the surfaces were described by a slab of five or more hexagonal layers of atoms . since the calculation assumes periodicity in all three dimensions , the metallic slabs were separated by typically five layers of vacuum .",
    "in addition to ideal surfaces , we calculated surfaces perturbed in various ways in order to deduce quantities like surface stress and surface energy , which can be used to estimate the stability of the surface .",
    "more details are given in the respective subsections .",
    "in the case of a clean surface , the unit cell in the directions along the surface plane @xmath0 consisted of one atom , and 56 @xmath1-points in the two - dimensional first brillouin zone were used . in some calculations described in the following subsections , e.g. , when alternate rows of first - layer atoms were displaced in opposite directions , in order to probe the restoring forces within the first layer ,",
    "unit cells with four atoms in each plane were used , and the number of @xmath1-points was reduced to 18 . in the @xmath2-direction ,",
    "perpendicular to the layers , only @xmath3 was considered , consistent with the assumption that the slabs , which repeat periodically because of the computational method , did not couple to each other . in most calculations ,",
    "the two bottom layers were kept fixed at the bulk separation .",
    "we used an energy cutoff for the plane - wave basis set of 340 ev , and the electronic occupation was smeared by a pseudothermal distribution of @xmath4 ev .",
    "we performed some checks with a lower value , @xmath5 ev , and found that the changes of the calculated quantities were irrelevant .",
    "next , we calculated the structure of clean ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "the relaxation of the surface layers from truncated bulk positions was found to be rather small for the three metals considered . for gold ,",
    "the first and second layers relax less than 0.3% of the interlayer distance in the @xmath6 direction , with an energy gain of 1 mev , which is irrelevant considering the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "the first platinum layer relaxes outwards by about 1% , with an energy gain of 2.5 mev .",
    "this unusual expansion of the interlayer distance has been observed experimentally.@xcite on copper , the first three layers move inwards by less than 1% , and the energy gain is 4 mev .",
    "we obtained the surface energy per atom as the difference of the energy of the bulk and of a slab . in order to minimize the influence of the computational details",
    ", we calculated the energy of the bulk using a six layer slab ( i.e. , twice the @xmath7 stacking of the @xmath8 fcc direction ) with no vacuum layers .",
    "after that , we changed the configuration by introducing four layers of vacuum which created two ( 111 ) surfaces , and calculated the energy , allowing both surfaces to relax .",
    "the surface energies @xmath9 , one half of the difference of the energies obtained in the two calculations , are given in the gga column in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "these values are consistently smaller by about one third than those calculated recently by vitos et al.@xcite and galanakis et al.@xcite and various experimental values reported therein .",
    "one possible source of the discrepancy are the different pseudopotentials and exchange - correlation functionals used .",
    "we therefore also report the surface energies calculated using the lda functional for the electronic densities obtained in the gga calculations , in the column labeled as lda in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "these electronic densities are , of course , non - self - consistent with respect to the lda functional .",
    "they are always larger than the gga results , in better agreement with refs .  .",
    "another possible source of discrepancy is the small thickness of the slab in our calculation . in the bulk calculation",
    "( i.e. , 6 layers without vacuum ) we used only one @xmath1-point in the @xmath2-direction , in order to keep the similarity with the surface calculations , and consequently the long - distance contributions in the @xmath2-direction might not be correctly taken into account .",
    "this can be investigated by using elementary cells with more layers , i.e. , repeating the @xmath7 structure three or more times , but we have not done such checks . also , we used the equilibrium lattice constants obtained self - consistently in our gga calculations which were larger than the experimental values and those obtained by other authors from lda calculations .",
    ".[parameters ] surface energy @xmath9 , surface stress @xmath10 , and force constants between nearest neighbors @xmath11 , for ( 111 ) surfaces of au , pt and cu .",
    "the two values of the surface energy @xmath9 have been obtained from a fully self - consistent dft gga calculation , and from applying the lda functional to the same electronic density , see text .",
    "the tree values of the force constant @xmath11 have been calculated from the bulk modulus @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and from the forces obtained in dft calculations in which the first - layer atoms were slightly displaced `` compressively '' @xmath14 or `` laterally '' @xmath15 , see fig .",
    "[ displacements ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we made slab calculations ( with relaxation turned off ) in which rows of atoms in the first layer were displaced by about 0.05  either in the direction of the rows or perpendicularly to it , as shown in fig .",
    "[ displacements ] .",
    "unlike other calculations in this paper , here we were not interested in the total energy , but rather in the restoring forces appearing owing to the nonequlibrium configurations .",
    "we analyzed the results assuming central harmonic interactions ( `` springs '' ) between nearest neighbors , neglecting the coupling to the second layer . taking into account the number of nearest neighbor bonds and the angles , we calculated the force constants @xmath16 .",
    "the results for both the bulk values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ spring ] ) and the surface dft calculations are shown in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "we note once again that this approach does not attempt to give a complete description of the lattice dynamical properties of the first surface layer . in general , even if the interactions with subsurface atoms are not taken into account , a set of force constants between second and further neighbours and/or angular force constants would be necessary in order to reproduce accurately the lattice dynamics , i.e. , the phonon spectra .",
    "the present approach is a simplification to be used only in an estimation of the stability of the surface layer .",
    "one may further object that the reconstruction has a large wavelength , while the displacements shown in fig .",
    "[ displacements ] correspond mainly to short - wavelength modes around the edge of the brillouin zone , and the estimated @xmath17 need not be the same . in our opinion ,",
    "the differences are small .",
    "when reconstruction occurs , some first - layer atoms are displaced to energetically less favorable positions with respect to the second layer .",
    "the last quantity which we need for an estimate of the stability is the amount of energy lost by the atoms when displaced to various nonoptimal positions .",
    "since the periodicity of the reconstruction pattern is large compared with the substrate periodicity ( e.g. , by a factor of around 22 on au(111 ) ) , the position of each subsequent atom along the reconstruction direction with respect to the second layer changes only slightly .",
    "a good estimate of the energy involved can be obtained by considering structures in which all atoms in the first layer are simultaneously displaced by the same vector .",
    "we performed dft calculations of such configurations , keeping the displacement in the @xmath18 plane fixed and allowing the atoms to relax in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "we first calculated the energy of the regular fcc configuration , denoted by @xmath19 in figures and tables , which is energetically the most favorable .",
    "next , we considered the configuration with the first layer atoms in the hcp hollows of the second layer ( @xmath20 ) , which is also a local energy minimum .",
    "we furthermore calculated the energy of some other configurations which are not local energy minima , keeping the @xmath21 and @xmath22 coordinates fixed , so that the algorithm for the atomic relaxation ignored the lateral forces acting on the first - layer atoms .",
    "these are ( see fig .",
    "[ positions ] ) the `` bridge '' position ( @xmath23 ) in which the first - layer atoms are halfway between fcc and hcp hollows , the on - top configuration ( @xmath24 ) , the configurations ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) halfway between ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath24 ) , and ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath24 ) , respectively , etc .",
    "( not all calculations were performed for all three metals . ) for the quasi - one - dimensional compressive reconstruction , the relevant configurations are along the path @xmath27 and back to @xmath23 and @xmath19 .",
    "( the on - top configuration , which is not occupied in the reconstruction , was calculated with the aim to obtain a better insight into the difference between various metals . ) in practice , the calculations were performed so that initially , all layers except the top one were kept fixed at the bulk configuration , the top layer had fixed @xmath21 and @xmath22 coordinates , and the @xmath2 coordinate was allowed to relax . in a second step , the bottom two layers were kept fixed , the intermediate layers were allowed to relax in all directions , and the top layer was allowed to relax in the @xmath2 direction only .",
    "the second step produced only minor changes for the symmetrical configurations ( @xmath19 ) , ( @xmath20 ) , ( @xmath24 ) , and ( @xmath23 ) , but the nonsymmetric configurations changed significantly , as the atoms in the second layer ( and to a lesser degree in deeper layers ) relaxed laterally under the force exerted by the first - layer atoms .    in fig .",
    "[ au ] we show the calculated energies , measured with respect to the energy of the fcc configuration , which was the lowest for all three metals .",
    "the `` bridge '' position , midway between fcc and hcp hollows , is approximately a saddle point .",
    "all points were calculated for five layers ( first one fixed in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , two free , two fixed ) , and some points were also calculated for six and seven layers . it was found that the energies changed by several mev , but the qualitative behavior remained similar , and the estimates of stability towards reconstruction in the following section are not affected . generally , the energies of symmetric configurations ( @xmath28 ) increase with increasing number of layers , while those of nonsymmetric configurations , like ( @xmath29 ) or ( @xmath26 ) , decrease .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in the latter case there are more atomic layers which are free to relax laterally , leading to a more complete relaxation .",
    "the first - layer atoms in positions other than the regular fcc one ( @xmath19 ) are also protruding further out .",
    "for all three metals , the values are similar , namely , around 0.1   for the bridge ( @xmath23 ) , 0.02   for the hcp ( @xmath20 ) , and @xmath30   for the on - top position ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the relevant quantity for the stability estimate is the average energy @xmath31 along the path @xmath32 , in the approximation of making a fourier expansion and keeping only the two lowest terms : @xmath33",
    "in this section we use the calculated quantities to discuss the stability of the surfaces of platinum , gold and copper .",
    "we first introduce the one - dimensional frenkel - kontorova model , and then discuss , in order , each of the considered surfaces , calculating the stability criteria , and comparing the results with the known experimental findings .      as already said ,",
    "the electronic structure of closed - packed metal surfaces is very different from that in the bulk , with an abrupt decrease in density of conduction electrons .",
    "the consequences may be a change of the length of the bonds between surface atoms , occasionally accompanied by a reconstruction which involves a change of the number of atoms in the first surface layer .",
    "the reconstruction of the fcc ( 111 ) surface involves a large number of atoms in inequivalent positions with respect to the underlying layer of atoms . in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments ,",
    "the reconstruction of the au(111 ) surface can be clearly seen as bright stripes,@xcite owing to the increased height of atoms which are out of registry with the second layer . on a larger scale ,",
    "the stripes form a herringbone pattern , as the quasi - one - dimensional reconstruction proceeds along three equivalent directions on the surface . a typical size of the reconstructed au(111 )",
    "supercell is @xmath34 .",
    "the reconstruction of the pt(111 ) surface is similar , but occurs only at high temperatures@xcite or in the presence of saturated pt vapour.@xcite stm micrographs show that the stripes do not form continuous patterns , but are instead well separated , with various types of intersections.@xcite the stripes in both systems consist of quasi - one - dimensional compressive reconstruction@xcite and can be treated as solitonic solutions of the frenkel - kontorova model.@xcite the large - scale two - dimensional structure of the reconstructed phase depends upon details of the interactions , and will not be discussed here .",
    "the one - dimensional frenkel - kontorova model@xcite consists of a linear chain of atoms , subject to two competing interactions with different intrinsic periodicities .",
    "the atoms interact via a nearest - neighbor harmonic coupling with a preferred lattice constant @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , there is an external periodic potential ( i.e. , the potential of the second atomic layer ) of a periodicity @xmath35 .",
    "depending on the strength of the external potential and the magnitude of the spring constant @xmath36 , various stable solutions are possible . at small `` pressures '' ( i.e. , small difference of @xmath35 and @xmath23 , small @xmath36 ) the external periodic potential dominates and all atoms are in potential minima , forming a commensurate phase .",
    "as the `` pressure '' increases , the natural periodicity of the atomic chain becomes more important . if , say , @xmath37 , solitons appear in which the atoms are closer to each other , thus gaining energy from the harmonic interaction but paying the cost of increased potential energy in the external potential . finally , when the external potential is weak compared with the elastic energy needed to stretch the atomic chain , the atoms follow the periodicity @xmath23 , forming an incommensurate phase .",
    "mansfield and needs@xcite have applied the frenkel - kontorova model to the reconstruction of ( 111 ) surfaces of the fcc metals .",
    "they have found that the relevant quantity is @xmath38 where the parameters of the frenkel - kontorova model have already been expressed in terms of the physical properties of real ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is the surface energy , @xmath10 is the surface stress , @xmath36 is 3/2 of the surface force constant , and @xmath31 is the average potential energy .",
    "( the factors 4/3 in the stress term and 3/2 in the definition of @xmath36 appear because the path @xmath39 is not straight . )",
    "@xmath35 is the distance from the fcc hollow site to the nearest hcp hollow site on the ( 111 ) surface , and @xmath40 is the surface area per atom .",
    "these quantities are the same ( or closely related to ) those calculated in the preceding section for real metal surfaces .",
    "there is no reconstruction for @xmath41 , the reconstruction is compressive for @xmath42 and expansive for @xmath43 .",
    "the quasicontinuum approach is valid if the magnitudes of the dimensionless quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 defined in eq .",
    "( [ reconstruction ] ) are large , say larger than 5 .    in the following subsections we apply this analysis to the ( 111 ) surfaces of gold , platinum , and copper .",
    "the relevant quantities derived in section  [ calculation ] are summarized in table  [ results ] , and the resulting @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given .",
    "in our calculations the first layer of an ideal au(111 ) surface relaxes outwards by about 0.005   , less than 0.3% , which is at the limit of accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the energy per surface atom of the hcp configuration is higher than that of the ideal ( fcc ) structure by around 10 mev per atom , and that of the bridge by 33 mev ( fig .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the calculations of takeuchi et al.@xcite and galanakis et al.,@xcite who used a density functional approach with a mixed basis set .",
    "these energies are the smallest of all metals considered here .",
    "the surface energy is also small , and owing to a moderately large tensile surface stress we obtain that @xmath45 is slightly larger than @xmath44 , indicating that the surface reconstructs .",
    "experimentally , the surface appears particularly prone to reconstruction , and a dense pattern of stripes of @xmath46 reconstruction is observed at room temperatures with stm.@xcite      our calculations show that the first atomic layer on pt(111 ) relaxes outwards by 0.023   or 1% . this somewhat exceptional behavior has also been found in other calculations and confirmed experimentally.@xcite it has been attributed to an outward pointing electrostatic force on the positively charged atoms of the first layer owing to the kind of spill - out of electrons away from the surface.@xcite the energy of the bridge configuration is around 46 mev larger than that of the regular fcc surface .",
    "the energy of the hcp configuration is only slightly smaller than the bridge ( even less so in calculations with 6 and 7 layers ) , which is different from the other surfaces considered .",
    "the force constant @xmath47 calculated assuming a `` longitudinal '' displacement of rows of first - layer atoms is reduced by about 30% compared with that derived from the bulk compressibility .",
    "the intrinsic tensile surface stress is large , more than twice larger than in the other two metals considered .",
    "although the surface energy is also quite large , the quantity @xmath45 is much larger than @xmath44 , predicting a strong tendency to reconstruct .",
    "experimentally , the reconstruction of pt(111 ) is observed only at high temperatures or in the presence of saturated platinum vapor.@xcite the nature of the reconstruction is similar to that of au(111 ) , but the stripes of compressive `` solitons '' do not form a dense pattern . instead , they are sparse , and occasionally intersect in several distinct ways.@xcite      unlike the other two metals considered , we find that the first layer on an ideal ( fcc ) cu(111 ) surface relaxes inwards by 0.014   .",
    "the contraction of the interlayer distance is usual for close packed surfaces of many transition metals .",
    "the hcp configuration is a clear local energy minimum , and the energy of the on - top configuration is found to be exceptionally large at about 250 mev .",
    "the intrinsic surface stress is again tensile , but rather small .",
    "the calculated @xmath45 is clearly smaller than @xmath44 , indicating that the surface does not reconstruct .",
    "indeed , no reconstructruction has been observed experimentally .      the use of the stability condition of ( 111 ) surfaces derived in the one - dimensional frenkel - kontorova model , eq .",
    "( [ reconstruction ] ) , gives correct qualitative answers , namely , that the surfaces of gold and platinum reconstruct compressively and the surface of copper does not . from a quantitative point of view , the agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfactory . we find that the condition for reconstruction , @xmath48 , is barely satisfied for the au(111 ) surfaces , while in experiments a dense pattern of reconstruction stripes is always found on this surface . on the other hand , we obtain that the condition of eq .",
    "( [ reconstruction ] ) is amply fulfilled for the pt(111 ) surface , while experimentally , reconstruction is observed only under favorable thermodynamic conditions , at high temperatures , or in the presence of pt vapor .",
    "it has already been noticed that calculations predict only a marginal tendency for reconstruction on au(111 ) , at variance with experiment .",
    "it has been suggested that the ordering of the reconstruction stripes into a herringbone pattern is indeed an essential contributing factor to the stability of the reconstructed phase.@xcite the theoretical overestimate of the tendency to reconstruct in the case of pt(111 ) may be due to the large value of the surface energy , which makes it unfavorable to bring additional atoms to the surface once the surface stress has been reduced by the formation of a few sparse reconstruction stripes . for a more complete treatment , a two - dimensional frenkel - kontorova model with a more realistic potential , calculated in a region around the minima , should be used .",
    "the approach used in this paper can also give relevant parameters for other physical properties .",
    "we have calculated relaxations around adatoms of the same species on the surfaces considered in this paper , and found that the force  relaxation ratio is consistent with the model of elastic constants calculated in section  [ calculation ] .",
    "surprisingly , in our calculations ( one adatom per four surface atoms ) the adsorption into a hcp hollow site was slightly more favorable than into a fcc hollow site for all three metals considered .",
    "we have not found any conclusive experimental data about this property .",
    "the approach can also be applied to relaxation around defects and chemisorbates of different species , energetics of self- and heterodiffusion , and other properties of ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "using the density functional theory approach we have calculated key properties of ( 111 ) surfaces of several metals , and evaluated the stability towards reconstruction into a uniaxially compressed reconstructed layer , using a one - dimensional quasicontinuum frenkel - kontorova model .",
    "the intrinsic surface stress is tensile for all surfaces , i.e. , the atoms in the first layer prefer a denser packing than dictated by the potential of the second layer , which reflects the bulk periodicity . on the opposite side of the energy balance",
    "is the energy required to bring an extra atom into the surface layer , and the energy lost owing to the fact that surface atoms in a reconstructed phase are no longer in the minima of the potential of the second layer .",
    "we have found that pt(111 ) reconstructs owing to a large intrinsic tensile surface stress .",
    "the stress on au(111 ) is considerably smaller , but the surface energy is also smaller and the reconstruction criterion is satisfied .",
    "the intrinsic surface stress in cu(111 ) is somewhat smaller than that in au(111 ) , but other quantities are unfavorable , and the surface does not reconstruct , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "experiments show that au(111 ) has the largest tendency to reconstruct , and dense reconstruction patterns are observed using stm , while pt(111 ) reconstructs only under favorable conditions , and only a small fraction of the surface is reconstructed .",
    "this is the opposite from what our reconstruction criteria suggest , where pt(111 ) is much deeper in the reconstruction regime .",
    "the reason may be further stabilization of the reconstruction of the gold surface by the formation of a two - dimensional herringbone structure,@xcite which is not included in the one - dimensional model used in the derivation ."
