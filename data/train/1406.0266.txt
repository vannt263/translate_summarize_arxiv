    "the idea of improving the traditional and often too conservative notion of familywise error rate ( fwer ) has been one of the main motivations behind much of the methodological developments taking place in modern multiple testing .",
    "one particular direction in which this idea has flourished is generalizing the fwer from its original definition of the probability of at least one false discovery or a nonzero fraction of false discoveries to one that allows more , yet tolerable , number or fraction of false discoveries and developing procedures that control these generalized error rates .",
    "the rationale behind taking this direction is that in many situations where a large number of hypotheses are tested one is often willing to tolerate more than one false discovery , controlling of course too many of them .",
    "moreover , due to high positive dependency among a group or groups of values corresponding to true null hypotheses , as in microarray experiments where the genes involved in the same biological process or pathway are highly dependent on each other and exhibit similar expression patterns , it is extremely unlikely that exactly one null @xmath2-value will be significant given that at least one of them will be significant . in such cases , a procedure controlling the probability of at least @xmath3 false discoveries , the @xmath3-fwer , for some fixed @xmath4 , or the probability of the false discovery proportion ( fdp ) exceeding @xmath1 , the @xmath1-fdp , for some fixed @xmath5 , will have a better ability to detect more false null hypotheses than the corresponding fwer procedure ( i.e. , when @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .    thus , the consideration of the @xmath3-fwer or @xmath1-fdp seems more relevant than that of the fwer when controlling false discoveries in multiple testing of a large number of hypotheses under dependency .",
    "in fact , it has been noted that the dependency gets naturally factored into the constructions of procedures controlling the @xmath3-fwer or @xmath1-fdp .",
    "for instance , the @xmath3-dimensional joint distributions of the null @xmath2-values can be explicitly used while constructing procedures controlling the @xmath3-fwer [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "also , since the fdp becomes more variable and gets more skewed with increasing dependence among the @xmath2-values [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ] , by controlling the tail end probabilities of the fdp , the @xmath1-fdp , one considers controlling a quantity that is more relevant under dependency than the expected fdp , the false discovery rate ( fdr ) [ @xcite ] , which is even less conservative than the fwer .",
    "a number of papers have been written over the years on @xmath3-fwer and @xmath1-fdp [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ] . among these ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite ( @xcite ) are worth mentioning as they have made some fundamental contributions to the development of theory and methodology of @xmath1-fdp .",
    "a part of our research is motivated by these papers , and aims at extending , and often improving , some results in those papers under certain dependence situations .",
    "the motivation of the other part of our research comes from the realization that if one indeed is willing to tolerate a few false rejections , the premise under which one would seek to use a generalized error rate , the notion of @xmath1-fdp does not completely take that into account unless it is further generalized accordingly . in other words , one should consider in this case a generalized form of the fdp that accounts for @xmath3 or more false rejections , and control the probability of this generalized fdp , rather than the original fdp , exceeding  @xmath1 .",
    "so , we introduce such a generalized notion of , called the kfdp , and propose procedures that control it under different dependence scenarios in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we provide some preliminaries in section  [ sec2 ] , including the definition of our proposed notion of @xmath1-kfdp .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] contains our main results on controlling the @xmath1-fdp and @xmath1-kfdp , developed assuming both positive dependence ( section  [ sec3.1 ] ) and arbitrary dependence ( section  [ sec3.2 ] ) conditions on the @xmath2-values in each of the following two scenarios : ( i ) only the marginal @xmath2-values are available and ( ii ) the marginal @xmath2-values as well as the common pairwise joint distributions of the null @xmath2-values are available .",
    "we obtain a number of newer results on @xmath1-fdp than what are available in the literature .",
    "we construct a larger class of procedures controlling the @xmath1-fdp under positive dependence than the stepdown procedure given in @xcite .",
    "this class includes the stepup analog of , and hence more powerful than , this lehmann  romano stepdown procedure .",
    "we offer better alternatives of the stepdown and stepup procedures in @xcite ( @xcite ) , given pairwise joint distributions of the null @xmath2-values .",
    "most of our main results have been obtained through a general framework that allows us not only to develop procedures controlling the newly proposed notion of @xmath1-kfdp , for @xmath8 , but also to produce the aforementioned new results on @xmath1-fdp by taking @xmath9 .",
    "the performances of the proposed @xmath1-fdp and @xmath1-kfdp procedures , individual as well as relative to relevant competitors , are numerically investigated through extensive simulations and reported in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section  [ sec5 ] .",

    "its generalized version introduced in this paper , which we call @xmath1-kfdp , is defined as follows : let @xmath29 then @xmath30 . since @xmath1-kfdp is @xmath31 , and",
    "hence trivially controlled , for any procedure if @xmath32 , we assume throughout the paper that @xmath33 when controlling this error rate . also , while constructing a @xmath1-kfdp controlling stepwise procedure , we will consider the first @xmath34 critical constants to be the same as the @xmath3th one , as in @xmath3-fwer procedures , since their choice does not matter in calculating the @xmath1-kfdp .",
    "[ re2.1 ] it should be noted that since @xmath23 and fdp are likely to be highly correlated the distribution of kfdp may be very similar to that of fdp with a small portion of its lower tail set to @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the difference between @xmath1-kfdp and @xmath1-fdp may be realized , with the control over @xmath1-kfdp providing the stipulated power improvement , only when @xmath35 exceeds a certain value .",
    "of course , this value , given a specified @xmath1 , would depend on the type and strength of dependence .",
    "we did a numerical study to verify this intuition and offer an insight into the choice of @xmath3 under different types and varying strengths of dependence , and report its findings in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .",

    "typically , only the marginal distributions of the null @xmath2-values are used when constructing multiple testing procedures . however , in practice , the null @xmath2-values often have a known common pairwise joint distribution , and it would be worthwhile to consider developing @xmath1-fdp or @xmath1-kfdp stepwise procedures explicitly utilizing such additional dependence information , which could potentially produce more powerful procedures than just using the marginal @xmath2-values . with that in mind , we construct our procedures in the following two different scenarios under each dependence condition : ( i ) only the marginal @xmath2-values are available , and ( ii ) the marginal @xmath2-values as well as the common pairwise joint distributions of the null @xmath2-values are available .",

    "-kfdp procedures in theorems [ th3.2 ] and [ th3.3 ] and the lr - type stepdown ( pair sd ) and stepup ( pair su ) @xmath1-kfdp procedures in theorem [ th3.4 ] with respect to different values of @xmath3 , all developed assuming positive dependence , for @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath51 . ]    our last set of simulations was carried out to investigate the following :    as a @xmath1-kfdp procedure under positive dependence , how does the type stepwise procedure in theorem  [ th3.4 ] incorporating pairwise correlation perform in terms of power with increasing @xmath3 and strength of dependence , compared to the corresponding lr - type stepwise procedure in theorems  [ th3.2 ] or  [ th3.3 ] that do not incorporate such pairwise correlation information ?",
    "we used the same simulation setting as in answering ( q3 ) . from figure  [ fig5 ] that answers this question , we see that the power of each of these lr - type stepwise kfdp procedures increases with @xmath3 , as expected .",
    "the power gap between the stepwise @xmath1-kfdp procedure in theorem  [ th3.4 ] and the corresponding stepwise kfdp procedure in theorems  [ th3.2 ] or [ th3.3 ] gets wider with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the  stepwise procedures in theorem  [ th3.4 ] are more powerful than the corresponding stepwise procedures in theorems  [ th3.2 ] and  [ th3.3 ] , irrespective of choice of @xmath3 if the test statistics are weakly correlated and with properly chosen @xmath3 if these statistics are moderately correlated .",
    "the paper is motivated by the need to advance the theory of fdp control which is still underdeveloped despite being well accepted by the multiple testing research community .",
    "our focus has been two - fold : ( i ) enlarging the class of procedures controlling the @xmath1-fdp , the existing notion of fdp control , and ( ii ) generalizing this notion to one that is often more appropriate and powerful  with improving some of the currently available results under certain dependence situations being the overreaching goal .",
    "we have given a large class of procedures controlling the @xmath1-fdp and its generalization under different dependence assumptions , and numerical evidences showing superior performances of the proposed procedures compared to those they intend to improve under some dependence cases , although these proposed procedures themselves , like their competitors , are still quite conservative .",
    "there is scope of doing further research in the context of what we discuss in this paper .",
    "we have defined the @xmath1-kfdp , for the first time in this paper , with the idea of introducing a more powerful notion of error rate than the @xmath1-fdp under dependence .",
    "we have proposed several procedures controlling the @xmath1-kfdp and given numerical evidence of their power superiority over the corresponding @xmath1-fdp controlling procedures for some specific values of @xmath3 and under certain dependence situations .",
    "although a deeper understanding of @xmath1-kfdp under dependence , particularly , how the choice of @xmath3 depends on correlations , would require studying distributional properties of fdp or kfdp under dependence , an area still less developed , we have provided some insight into it through additional simulations whose findings are reported in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] . in particular , it has been noted that the difference between controlling @xmath1-kfdp and @xmath1-fdp and the stipulated power gain in using a @xmath1-kfdp procedure over the corresponding @xmath1-fdp procedure may not be realized until @xmath35 reaches a certain critical point .",
