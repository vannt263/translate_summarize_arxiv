    "a considerable interest has been shown in the analysis of the effects of squeezed light on the quantum properties of the fluorescent light emitted by a two - level atom in a cavity .",
    "the power spectrum of the fluorescent light emitted by a two - level atom interacting with a cavity mode driven by coherent light and coupled to a squeezed vacuum reservoir has been studied by several authors  @xcite .",
    "some of these studies show that the width of the incoherent spectrum in the weak driving light limit decreases as the degree of squeezing increases  @xcite . on the other hand , for a strong driving light",
    ", the side peaks of the mollow spectrum are always broadened while the central peak could be broadened or narrowed depending on the relative phase between the strong driving light and the squeezed vacuum  @xcite .",
    "moreover , agarwal @xcite has considered coherently driven @xmath0 two - level atoms passing through a squeezed cavity mode in the good - cavity limit .",
    "he has found modifications of the mollow triplet due to the presence of the squeezed light . on the other hand , jin and xiao",
    "@xcite have considered @xmath0 two - level atoms placed inside a parametric oscillator in the good - cavity limit .",
    "they have found that under strong - interaction limit , the presence of the two - level atoms inside the parametric oscillator increases the amount of intracavity squeezing from its maximum value of @xmath1 to a maximum value of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , clemens _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the power spectrum of the light emitted by a two - level atom inside a parametric oscillator in the week driving light limit .",
    "they have found that the incoherent spectrum consists of a vacuum - rabi doublet with holes in each side band .    in this paper",
    "we consider a degenerate parametric oscillator operating below threshold and whose cavity contains a two - level atom .",
    "the interaction of the signal light , produced by the parametric amplifier , with the two - level atom leads to the generation of fluorescent light .",
    "thus the cavity mode in this case consists of the signal light and the fluorescent light emitted by the two - level atom . in this paper",
    "we analyze the quantum statistical properties of the fluorescent and the signal light applying the heisenberg and quantum langevin equations in the bad - cavity limit .",
    "this system can also be studied using the master equation in the bad - cavity limit . employing the bad - cavity limit ,",
    "one usually obtains the master equation for the atomic density operator .",
    "hence it will not be possible in this approach to study the properties of the cavity mode .",
    "the method used in this paper enables us to study not only the properties of the fluorescent light emitted by the two - level atom but also the properties of the cavity mode .",
    "we derive the equations of evolution for the expectation values of atomic and cavity mode operators using the heisenberg and quantum langevin equations in the bad - cavity limit . applying the resulting equations",
    ", we calculate the mean photon number , the quadrature variance , and the power spectrum for the cavity mode , for the signal light , and for the fluorescent light .",
    "we also determine the second order correlation function for the fluorescent light .",
    "we consider a single two - level atom inside a parametric oscillator coupled to a vacuum reservoir .",
    "we represent the upper and lower levels of the atom by @xmath3 and @xmath4 and we assume the atom to be at resonance with the cavity mode ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in a degenerate",
    "parametric oscillator , a pump photon of frequency @xmath5 is down converted into a pair of highly correlated signal photons each of frequency @xmath6 .",
    "it so turns out that the signal light is in a squeezed state .",
    "contrary to the work of clemens _",
    "et al_. @xcite where they considered weak squeezed light ( two photons in the cavity at a time ) , we have not imposed any restriction on the number of signal photons in the cavity . with the pump mode",
    "treated classically , the parametric interaction can be described by the hamiltonian  @xcite        @xmath7    in which @xmath8 , assumed to be real and constant , is proportional to the amplitude of the pump mode and @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode .",
    "in addition , the interaction of the cavity mode with the two - level atom is describable by the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the atom - cavity mode coupling constant and @xmath12 are atomic operators satisfying the commutation relations @xmath13=\\hat\\sigma_{z}$ ] and @xmath14=\\mp 2\\hat\\sigma_{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "thus the hamiltonian describing the parametric interaction and the interaction of the cavity mode with the two - level has the form @xmath15 applying the heisenberg equation , one can readily establish that the time evolution of the atomic operators are of the form @xmath16 @xmath17 on the other hand , the quantum langevin equation for the cavity mode operator @xmath9 is expressible as    @xmath18-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\hat a+\\hat f,\\ ] ]    so that on account of eq .",

    "are nonlinear and coupled differential equations , it is not possible to obtain exact solutions .",
    "we then seek to obtain the solutions of these equations applying the bad - cavity limit . in the bad - cavity limit",
    ", the cavity damping constant is much greater than the cavity atomic decay rate . in this limit",
    ", the cavity mode variables decay faster than the atomic variables .",
    "we can then set the time derivatives of the cavity mode variables equal to zero while keeping the zero - order atomic and cavity mode variables at time t. in view of this , we obtain from eq . that    @xmath26    this result will be used to calculate the expectation values of the products of a cavity mode operator and an atomic operator",

    ", we need to adopt a certain approximation scheme . to this end , ignoring the noncommutativity of the atomic and noise operators , we see that @xmath37 . then upon neglecting the correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath38 , assumed to be considerably small , one can write the approximately valid relation  @xcite @xmath39 . following a similar line of reasoning",
    ", one can also write the approximately valid relation @xmath40 . now using these approximations and taking into account the fact that a noise operator @xmath21 at time t does not affect the atomic variables at earlier times , eq .",
    "can be put in the form @xmath41 therefore using eqs . and and performing the integration , we find @xmath42 we immediately notice that @xmath43 it can also be readily established in a similar manner that    [ 18 ] @xmath44 @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    with the aid of eqs . - , , , and employing the relation @xmath49 , eqs . and can be written as @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cavity atomic decay rate . in view of the fact that @xmath53 and @xmath54 one can write @xmath55 in the absence of the parametric amplifier the cavity atomic decay rate is @xmath56 .",
    "thus we can express @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "it can be easily seen that the presence of the parametric amplifier enhances the cavity atomic decay rate .",

    "2 shows that the power spectrum of the fluorescent light is a single peak centered at @xmath79 .",
    "we have found that the half width of the power spectrum increases from @xmath80 to @xmath81 as @xmath82 increases from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "contrary to the power spectrum of the fluorescent light from a two - level atom driven by a strong coherent light  @xcite , the power spectrum in this case turns out to be a single peak .",

    "therefore we see that for @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the fluorescent light thus exhibits the phenomenon of photon antibunching , as is always the case .",
    "this is due to the fact that a two - level atom can not emit two or more photons simultaneously .",
    "after each emission the atom returns to the lower level and it must absorb a photon before another emission can take place . fig .",
    "3 indicates that for relatively small values of @xmath97 the second - order correlation function is less than unity which reflects the nonclassical feature of antibunching",
    ". we also observe that as @xmath82 increases @xmath98 approaches unity at a faster rate .",
    "versus @xmath97 for @xmath73 , for @xmath99 ( solid curve ) , for @xmath75 ( dotted curve).,height=226 ]    it is also interesting to consider the dynamics of the two - level atom .",
    "thus upon replacing @xmath97 by @xmath100 and @xmath100 by @xmath101 in eq . and using the relation @xmath102 , the probability for the two - level atom to be in the upper level is found to be @xmath103 if the atom is initially in the upper level , then @xmath104 .",
    "hence eq . takes for this case the form @xmath105 and at steady state , we have @xmath106     versus @xmath107 in the presence of the parametric amplifier with @xmath108 ( solid curve ) and in the absence of the parametric amplifier , i.e , for @xmath109 ( dotted curve).,height=226 ]    we see from fig .",
    "4 that the probability for the atom to be in the upper level decays exponentially in the absence of the parametric amplifier and approaches to zero at steady state .",
    "however , in the presence of the parametric amplifier the steady state probability for the atom to be in the upper level is different from zero .",
    "this is because there are photons in the cavity that can be absorbed by the atom .",
    "in this section we calculate the mean photon number and the quadrature variance for the cavity mode .",

    "@xmath124 on account of and , eqs . and reduce at steady state to @xmath125 and @xmath126    now with the aid of and , the mean photon number of the cavity mode is found at steady state to be @xmath127 we observe that the first term in eq .",
    "represents the mean photon number of the signal light in the absence of the two - level atom ( @xmath128 ) , the second term corresponds to the mean number of absorbed signal photons , and the last term represents the mean number of photons emitted by the two - level atom .",
    "therefore , the cavity mode is a superposition of the signal light with a mean photon number @xmath129 and the fluorescent light with a mean photon number @xmath130 expression indicates that the presence of the two - level atom leads to a decreases in the mean photon number of the signal light . upon adding the last two terms in , the mean photon number of the cavity mode takes the form @xmath131 since the second term is negative , we conclude that the mean number of photons absorbed by the two - level atom is greater than the mean number of emitted photons .",
    "applying eq .",
    "in , we get @xmath132 now introducing into , the quadrature variance for the cavity mode is found to be @xmath133 and @xmath134 we recall that in the bad - cavity limit , the cavity damping constant @xmath20 is much greater than the cavity atomic decay rate @xmath135 , i.e. , @xmath136 . in view of this",
