    "the very large areal coverage of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite searched the sdss early data release @xcite for unusual quasars with anomalously low civ154.9 nm emission , and found a luminous @xmath1 starburst candidate that appeared to have been incorrectly classified as a quasar by the sdss pipeline .    following on from this find",
    ", @xcite identified a further five sources from the sdss first data release ( dr1 ) quasar catalog @xcite at @xmath2@xmath32.52.8 with rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) colours similar to lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , * ? ? ? * ) and exhibiting weak or absent high - ionisation emission lines in their rest - frame uv spectra .",
    "all six objects have @xmath4-band magnitudes of 19.820.5 , with a median of @xmath5 , i.e.they are an order of magnitude brighter than the most luminous objects in existing lbg surveys .",
    "@xcite showed that if their uv emission arises solely from star formation then they are intensely active star - forming galaxies with strong lower limits on their star - formation rates ranging from 300 to 1100m@xmath6yr@xmath7 , assuming negligible absorption by dust and adopting a continuous star - formation rate over @xmath8yrs @xcite .",
    "thus these candidate lbgs could be rare , extreme starbursts seen at the epoch , @xmath1 , when both the accretion luminosity density and the star - formation rate density in the universe are believed to peak @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the brightness and apparent rarity of these systems could simply reflect the fact that they are rare , strongly - magnified examples of the normal - luminosity lbg population .",
    "the lbg candidates show no evidence of multiple components at the resolution of sdss imaging ( @xmath91arcsec ) and there are no obvious foreground lensing structures .",
    "nevertheless , gravitational lensing can not yet be ruled out based on existing imaging .    the best argument _ against _ these galaxies being highly - magnified examples of normal lbgs results from their spectral properties : the underlying continuua are much redder than typical lbgs , with observed 200600-nm spectral indices ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) , cf .",
    "@xmath13 for most lbgs @xcite , and the low - resolution sdss spectra show strong ( sometimes broad ) interstellar absorption lines and ly@xmath14 emission in several cases , as well as hints of broad ciii]190.9 nm emission in two cases @xcite .",
    "these features contrast with the narrow emission and interstellar absorption lines seen in the composite lbg spectrum of @xcite , but may be explained due to star - formation activity ( and perhaps associated winds ) an order of magnitude more vigorous than the sample considered by @xcite .",
    "the gross spectral properties of a source should not be affected markedly by lensing , so these differences argue that these galaxies are unlikely to be highly - magnified examples of the general lbg population .",
    "rather , the spectral properties of these sources share key characteristics with the submm - selected galaxies identified in the recent spectroscopic survey of @xcite . in particular , they resemble n2850.4 , a composite starburst / agn at @xmath2=2.38 @xcite and the bal  sy2/qso smm j02399@xmath00136 at @xmath2=2.80 @xcite  the two - component ly@xmath14 emission , broad ciii ] and the absorption seen in cii , siiv , aliii and civ  although the candidate lbgs lack such prominent p - cygni profiles",
    ". the lbg candidates also share some common characteristics with broad absorption - line ( bal ) quasars  the presence of broad ciii]190.9 nm in two examples and some very broad absorption lines  although the line profiles are not typical of bals .",
    "there is thus a possibility that the uv emission from these galaxies is powered by accretion rather than star formation , or that the sample is a heterogeneous mix of star - forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite discusses an unusual object , sdssj113658.36 + 024220.1 , whose rest - frame uv spectrum shows a single emission line corresponding to ly@xmath14 but no obvious metal - line emission , which bears some similarities to the candidate lbgs studied here .",
    "@xcite interpret sdssj1136 as an agn based in large part on tentative optical variability and its strong radio emission , @xmath31.4mjy at 1.4ghz .",
    "if these galaxies are truly related to starburst lbgs then their prodigious star formation should be betrayed in the rest - frame far - infrared . here",
    ", we exploit submm common - user bolometer array  scuba , @xcite  submillimetre ( submm ) photometry to search for such emission .",
    "we then use new , high - resolution , near - infrared imaging to identify the morphological signatures of strong lensing . finally , we present near - infrared spectra of these galaxies , covering a number of key rest - frame optical emission lines falling in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 atmospheric windows , to spectroscopically classify the galaxies and to search for quasar signatures such as a tell - tale broad component to the h@xmath14 line .",

    "however , statistical measurements of the submm emission from samples of @xmath30 lbgs , reaching below scuba s confusion limit , suggest that they may contribute substantially to the smg population at sub - mjy levels @xcite .",
    "only a handful of brighter examples are known @xcite .",
    "there is evidence of a more significant overlap between smgs and the uv - selected population identified at somewhat lower redshifts , @xmath2@xmath31.52.5 @xcite , although again many of the smgs are too faint to be included in the photometric samples @xcite .    the raw star - formation rates estimated from the observed uv luminosities of the sdss sources , uncorrected for dust extinction , would imply @xmath31l@xmath6 for our sample , where sfr = @xmath32 10@xmath33m@xmath6yr@xmath7 and @xmath32 = 0.82.1 @xcite , and thus 850-@xmath22 m flux densities of 310mjy @xcite .",
    "assuming a correction factor for dust extinction typical of lbgs , 6@xmath29 @xcite , the predicted submm fluxes would increase by a similar factor .",
    "this suggests that the candidate lbgs should be detectable in the submm waveband if they have submm / uv flux ratios similar to the more typical luminosity members of this population .",
    "this conclusion holds whether these galaxies are either intrinsically bright in the uv or are lensed ( assuming that the lensing does not preferentially boost the uv - bright regions ) .",
    "the submm data presented in table  1 demonstrate that the four sdss sources we have observed are all undetected individually at flux limits of 68mjy .",
    "this implies that it is unlikely that these galaxies are simply scaled - up or strongly - lensed examples of typical - luminosity @xmath30 lbgs .",
    "indeed , the weighted mean for the four sources ( @xmath00.36@xmath341.31mjy ) suggests that they would not have been detected in even the deepest submm survey , although we can not rule out the possibility that the sample is heterogeneous , with a handful of faint submm emitters .",

    "the median @xmath45 colour of our sample is comparable to that seen for @xmath30 lbgs from @xcite , @xmath48 , although our candidate lbgs are redder on average in @xmath46 than the standard uv - selected populations at @xmath49 or @xmath30 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the rest - frame uv continua may be significantly redder than normal lbgs , although their rest - frame optical continua are comparable ( before correcting for emission - line contributions ) .    turning to the high - resolution near - infrared imaging ( fig .  1 )",
    ", we find that all five candidate lbgs are unresolved at the 0.450.55-arcsec seeing of our @xmath16-band images ( as measured from multiple stars in each frame ) .",
    "given the signal to noise of our detections of the lbgs and their measured fwhm relative to stars in the fields , we can place firm limits of @xmath52arcsec fwhm on the sizes of these sources or on the separation of multiple components if they are strongly lensed . in the absence of lensing , this angular limit corresponds to an intrinsic size of @xmath391kpc for the physical scale of these sources in their rest - frame @xmath53-band light .",
    "we identify none of the morphological signatures expected from strong galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing in our deep @xmath16-band images : multiple lensed components or an identifiable foreground lens .",
    "we note that the angular size limit estimated above , if taken as the einstein diameter , would correspond to a velocity dispersion of only 50kms@xmath7 ( for a spherical isothermal lens at @xmath54 ) .",
    "this velocity dispersion would correspond to a @xmath30.1l@xmath55 early - type galaxy with an expected magnitude of @xmath56 at @xmath54 , detectable in our imaging out to @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "no such nearby lenses are visible in our imaging on the relevant scales ( 0.22arcsec ) .",
    "looking at a wider region around the candidate lbgs we see a compact @xmath16=17.9 galaxy ( with @xmath58 ) lying only 4arcsec away from sdssj1553 , but this would not provide a strong amplification of the source . we also find that sdssj1432 sits in the outskirts of a dense , compact foreground group , the brightest members of which have @xmath16@xmath316 .",
    "it is possible that the lbg candidate is thus magnified by weak lensing from the foreground structure , although the total magnification is likely to be modest .",
    "the fields surrounding sdssj0243 and sdssj1444 are unremarkable , but we do identify a group of 56 faint , resolved galaxies , @xmath16@xmath919.4 , within 15arcsec of sdssj1147 .",
    "these are possibly members of a cluster , either in the foreground or ( given their faintness ) associated with the candidate lbg .",
    "these faint galaxies exhibit a wide range in @xmath45 colours , 0.83.0 , including some extremely red objects .",
    "in addition , several brighter galaxies , @xmath16@xmath917.3 , lie within 20arcsec .",
    "we can not demonstrate a significant over - density , but they could be more luminous members of the same structure .    looking at the @xmath26@xmath16 colour - magnitude plots ( fig .",
    "2 ) for the five fields we see that the lbg candidates are rarely the reddest galaxy in the field , although both sdssj1147 and sdssj1432 have very red , close neighbours ( @xmath593.0 ) .",
    "the most striking feature is the colour - magnitude sequence seen in the distribution of galaxy colours in the sdssj1432 field .",
    "this has a characteristic colour of @xmath60 at @xmath61 , consistent with that expected for evolved galaxies in a group or poor cluster at @xmath620.8 @xcite .",
    "the close similarity of the colours of the candidate lbg to these galaxies may either be a coincidence or could point to contamination of our photometric measurement by a superimposed member of this group ( which could thus also gravitationally magnify the background source ) .",
    "we believe that the similarities in the colours are merely a coincidence as it is clear from the spectrum of sdssj1432 ( fig .",
    "3 ) that there is a significant contribution to the @xmath16-band light from the background source .",
    "we conclude that the morphological information for all five of the candidate lbgs we have imaged at @xmath630.55-arcsec resolution provides no support for them being strongly lensed .",
    "there is possible evidence for weak lensing for one or more sources , but this would not significantly affect the apparent magnitudes of these systems .",
    "it is immediately apparent from the rest - frame optical spectra presented in fig .",
    "3 that all six of the spectroscopically - observed lbg candidates contain broad - line agn .",
    "all have broad h@xmath14 emission , with fwhm line widths ranging from 5,000 to @xmath314,000kms@xmath7 ( table  2 ) and broad components visible in h@xmath35 for several systems ( despite the typically poorer signal - to - noise in the @xmath15-band ) .",
    "sdssj1444 has the weakest emission and there is no spectral coverage beyond the red extreme of the line due to its high redshift , but a broad h@xmath14 line is still apparent . comparing them to the two known agn we observed , the weak - lined agn sdssj1136 and the low - ionisation balqso sdssj1353 , we see that the candidate lbgs exhibit broader h@xmath14 emission than either of these two agn .",
    "so , clear agn features are visible in the rest - frame optical , whereas the uv spectra of these galaxies are characterised by a strong continuum but lack the strong emission lines typical of agn .",
    "does the agn contribute significantly to the uv fluxes of these galaxies ?",
    "the redshift measurements available to us tend to follow the same pattern for all the lbg candidates : the uv - determined values , based predominantly on the prominent ly@xmath14 emission line , are slightly blueward of the [ oiii]500.7 nm and h@xmath14 lines ( @xmath640.0051@xmath340.0057 and 0.0065@xmath650.0037 , respectively ) .",
    "the only exception is sdssj1444 , where the ly@xmath14 and h@xmath14 redshifts are identical , but the h@xmath14 redshift is poorly determined .",
    "the h@xmath14 emission we see originates close to the agn , in the broad - line region ( blr ) , so it is natural to assume that the uv absorption lines are due to wind - driven material in our line of sight to the blr , and that the uv continuum also arises close to the agn .",
    "indeed , there is a tight correlation between the fwhm of the h@xmath14 ( table  2 ) and the absolute @xmath66-band magnitudes from @xcite : the 0.07-dex scatter suggests a close relationship between the uv continuum emission and the agn .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this is a direct relationship , or whether it arises merely because more massive agn reside in more luminous galaxies . nevertheless , assuming that the candidate lbgs have intrinsic power - law continua characteristic of normal quasars , with @xmath67 @xcite , then their observed rest - frame 200600-nm spectral slopes ( @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) indicate substantial dust extinction , @xmath701.95 , for a calzetti extinction law @xcite .",
    "but where are the uv emission lines usually associated with quasar activity ? if they have been quenched by dust surrounding the active nuclei , why can we still see intense uv continuum emission ?",
    "the spectral characteristics of these galaxies are unusual , but the presence of strong and broad absorption lines in the uv are similar to those seen in less - reddened examples of the most extreme bal quasars found by the sdss @xcite and in the digitized palomar observatory sky survey @xcite .",
    "indeed , very recently @xcite have published high - resolution chelle spectroscopy of sdssj1553 which provides much higher - quality information about the uv spectral properties of this galaxy .",
    "based on their analysis of the detailed properties of the absorption lines , they conclude that sdssj1553 is a low - ionisation bal quasar ( lobalqso ) , or perhaps an even rarer felobalqso .",
    "the very strong low - ionisation absorption features found in lobalqsos across a wide velocity range can strongly suppress the emission - line components in these systems , leading to the absorption - dominanted uv spectra we see .",
    "the uv absorption features of sdssj1553 are typical of those seen in the other five galaxies and so we expect that deeper and higher resolution spectroscopy of the complete sample would likely lead to the same conclusion for the other sources .",
    "indeed , based on the existing low - resolution sdss spectra , @xcite suggest at least two - thirds of the sample may be lobalqsos .",
    "the relative weakness and narrowness of the bal features , combined with the absence of strong uv emission features , suggests that the outflows in these galaxies may differ in terms of their velocity and spatial coverage compared to those seen in typical lobalqsos .",
    "alternatively , these agn may be similar to sdssj1136 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which @xcite suggest for some unknown reason has weak , broad and highly blue - shifted emission lines .    finally , we want to highlight the properties of sdssj1340 .",
    "this candidate lbg was detected at 16@xmath22 m using _ spitzer _ by @xcite .",
    "they interpret this detection in terms of a massive starburst , even though the optical / mid - infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sdssj1340 in @xcite is best fit by the sed for the seyfert-1 , ngc5548 .",
    "our non - detection of the source in the submm suggests that the 16@xmath22 m detection most likely arises from high - temperature agn - heated dust , rather than a bolometrically luminous starburst .",
    "further support for the presence of a bolometrically luminous agn in this system comes from the detection of a strong and broad h@xmath14 line in our near - infrared spectrum ( fig .",
    "we present multi - wavelength observations of a sample of six candidate lbgs at @xmath712.8 identified from the sdss dr1 qso catalog by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that these sources could be either : 1 ) intrinsically luminous , uv - bright starbursts ; 2 ) strongly - lensed examples of typical - luminosity lbgs ; or 3 ) a class of quasars with extremely weak uv emission lines .",
    "we do not detect any of the four candidate lbgs observed in the submm , placing a strong constraint on the submm emission from the ensemble .",
    "this suggests that the sources are unlikely to be strongly - lensed examples of more typical lbgs , or intrinsically - luminous lbgs , unless the far - infrared emission from such uv starbursts declines precipitously at high luminosities .",
    "two further pieces of evidence weigh against the lensing hypothesis : first , the uv spectral properties of the candidate lbgs do not match those of typical luminosity lbgs ; second , using high - resolution near - infrared imaging of five of the candidates we find no morphological evidence of strong lensing . taking these results together ,",
    "we conclude that the sources in our sample are unlikely to be either intrinsically - luminous lbgs or rare , strongly - lensed examples of more normal lbgs .",
    "this suggests that they are most likely to be unusual agn .",
    "our near - infrared spectroscopy confirms this suggestion , identifying very broad lines in the rest - frame optical spectra of all six galaxies in the sample .",
    "we therefore conclude that the six apparently extremely luminous lbgs identified by @xcite are likely to be lobalqsos whose unusually weak uv emission lines may either be an intrinsic property of these agn @xcite or result from a complex distribution of absorption in the outflow close to the agn .",

    "<S> we have investigated the rest - frame optical and far - infrared properties of a sample of extremely bright candidate lyman - break galaxies ( lbg ) identified in the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> their high ultraviolet luminosities and lack of strong ultraviolet emission lines are suggestive of massive starbursts , although it is possible that they are more typical luminosity lbgs which have been highly magnified by strong gravitational lensing . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , they may be an unusual class of weak - lined quasars . </S>",
    "<S> if the ultraviolet and submillimetre properties of these objects mirror those of less luminous , starburst lbgs , then they should have detectable rest - frame far - infrared emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , our submm photometry fails to detect such emission , indicating that these systems are not merely scaled - up ( either intrinsically or as a result of lensing ) examples of typical lbgs . in addition </S>",
    "<S> we have searched for the morphological signatures of strong lensing , using high - resolution , near - infrared imaging , but we find none . </S>",
    "<S> instead , near - infrared spectroscopy reveals that these systems are , in fact , a rare class of broad absorption - line ( bal ) quasars .    </S>",
