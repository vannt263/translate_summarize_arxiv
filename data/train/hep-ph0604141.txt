    "an enhancement has been observed by the bes collaboration near the threshold of the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath13 in the radiative decay @xmath14 .",
    "their results indicate the existence of a new resonant state of @xmath0 with a mass and a width given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the observed branching ratio for @xmath4 is @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this resonant state is named as @xmath1 .",
    "earlier the bes collaboration also reported another @xmath0 state in the spectrum of @xmath18 of @xmath19 with a mass of @xmath20 mev and a width of @xmath21 mev , named @xmath9 .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath22 is determined to be @xmath23@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath9 is a @xmath24 state .",
    "there are several other @xmath25 states with mass in the range of 1 gev to 2 gev , these are @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the states @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , having the same quantum numbers with masses not far from each other , can have significant mixing .",
    "the usual basis describing meson mixing based on qcd picture , includes quarkonia and glueball . without considering excited states , the ground states of the quarkonia and glueball basis , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "can only accommodate three @xmath25 states .",
    "previous studies have , therefore , considered three states mixing with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as members@xcite .",
    "the addition of @xmath9 into the picture requires an enlargement of the basis . in qcd ,",
    "the next simplest states having the quantum numbers compared with the quarkonia and glueball basis is the hybrid basis composed of an anti - quark @xmath29 , a quark @xmath30 and a gluon @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 which contains two independent @xmath33 states , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "therefore introduction of hybrid states to accommodate @xmath9 implies the existence of another @xmath33 state . in our recent study@xcite ,",
    "we have carried out such an analysis .",
    "since the mass of the possible new state was not known at the time , two solutions for the eigenstates ( mainly hybrid states ) were obtained with one of them having a mass about 1760 mev and the other about 1820 mev .",
    "the later case fits the new @xmath1 state well within the experimental error .",
    "we remark that the identification of @xmath1 as a mainly hybrid state has an extra bonus . if @xmath1 is a quarkonia state , @xmath14 decay is a doubly ozi suppressed process .",
    "thus its branching ratio should be small .",
    "the observed branching ratio @xmath36 is too large to be explained .",
    "this fact indicates that @xmath1 contains exotic component which allows larger branching ratio for @xmath37 .",
    "we note that both glueball and hybrid states can transit into a @xmath38 state without the usual ozi suppression .",
    "if indeed @xmath1 is mainly a hybrid state , it can naturally explain the large than expected branching ratio for @xmath39 .",
    "the quarkonia , glueball and hybrid ( qgh ) mixing scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite therefore provides a natural description of the five members in the @xmath25 family mentioned above . in this paper",
    "we study further the implications of the qgh mixing scheme , and comment on four quark scheme for @xmath1 .",
    "we now study possible structure for the qgh mixing .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath40 for the system can not be calculated from qcd yet because of complicated non - perturbative effects .",
    "there have been some efforts to estimate the masses of hybrid mesons by using constituent gluon model@xcite , flux tube model@xcite , bag model@xcite , qcd sum rules@xcite and also lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "a summary at hardron95 listed the mass range for the ground - state of hybrid as 1.3 - 1.8gev@xcite .",
    "some relevant topics about the experimental status of hybrid states can be found in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the author used the bag model to estimate the mass ranges of scalar hybrids , and obtained 1.51 - 1.90 gev for @xmath41 and 2.0 - 2.1 gev for @xmath42 .",
    "lattice calculations give @xmath43@xcite to be in the range @xmath44 gev .",
    "since theoretical uncertainties on the masses are too large to rule out a particular mass range , we will take a more phenomenological approach assuming the qgh mixing scheme and study some consequences of this mixing scheme .",
    "although it is difficult to have a precise theoretical prediction on the mixing parameters , some simplifications can be made .",
    "one first notices that the matrix elements @xmath45 and @xmath46 are ozi suppressed and can therefore be neglected at the lowest order approximation .",
    "the same argument applies to @xmath47 .",
    "possible large mixing can occur between glueball and quarkonia , hybrid states .",
    "since the couplings of glueball - quarkonia , and glueball - hybrid are flavor - independent , one has the relation @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . with the approximation described above",
    ", the mass matrix can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we parameterize the relation between the physical states and the basis as @xmath56    as @xmath40 is not derivable and therefore neither all the matrix elements , we need to determine them by fitting data .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend on the seven parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the available data which are directly related to these parameters are the five known eigen - masses of @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 . to completely fix all the parameters ,",
    "more information is needed . to this end , we use information from the ratios of the measured branching ratios of @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 to two pseudoscalar mesons listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fig-2 ]    * @xmath63 *    the two - vector - meson decay modes are important ones to study since in fact the resonance @xmath1 is observed in the @xmath64 channel .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is similar to that for the pseudoscalar meson case with certain modifications .",
    "corresponding to each of the terms for @xmath65 in eq.([decay ] ) , there are two terms @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 is the nonet vector meson states , @xmath70    we will denote the couplings by @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the two terms respectively for @xmath64 decays , in place of @xmath73 for @xmath74 decays .",
    "for example , the terms corresponding to @xmath75 $ ] will be written as @xmath76 + g_{1}a_1\\mathrm{tr}[x_{f}v^\\mu v_\\mu]$ ] . to the leading approximation",
    "one can neglect the ozi suppressed amplitudes @xmath77 .",
    "we obtain@xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 with @xmath80 . here",
    "we have only kept s - wave contribution since the decays are all close to the threshold and the dominant contribution comes from the s - wave term . with this approximation ,",
    "there is just one parameter @xmath81 to consider for each of the terms .",
    "unfortunately at present not much experimental information is available for @xmath64 decays except @xmath82 .",
    "further theoretical considerations are needed to clarify the situation and make useful predictions . to this end",
    "we notice , from eq.([u ] ) , that the physical state @xmath1 and @xmath9 are dominated by @xmath35 and @xmath83 . if the parameters @xmath84 are within a factor of o(1 ) order , one can neglect terms proportional to @xmath85 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 in eq.([vv-4 ] ) for @xmath1 and @xmath9 @xmath64 decays . with this approximation",
    "the decay amplitudes depend on only two unknown parameters , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the ratios @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 depend on just one parameter @xmath92 . in figure 2",
    ", we show the ratios for @xmath93 for @xmath94 varying from 0.3 to 3 for illustration .",
    "we see that the relative branching ratios can change a large range .",
    "when more experimental data become available , information on the parameter @xmath94 will be extracted .",
    "c    we now make an estimate of the branching ratio for @xmath95 .",
    "the transition matrix element of @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 if the su(3 ) symmetry applies , we would have @xmath98 and the relations @xcite roughly hold @xmath99 we obtain an estimation @xmath100 ^ 2|m(j/\\psi\\rightarrow \\gamma g)|^2,\\label{jpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the three - momentum of final states in the center of mass frame of @xmath102 .",
    "+ to obtain information on @xmath103 and therefore the branching ratios for @xmath104 , we use experimental data on @xmath105 , @xmath106 @xcite , and obtain the ranges and central values ( in the brakect ) in the following with @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 which leads to @xmath109 obviously , the numbers obtained are based on crude approximation which should be taken as an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "in our earlier work@xcite , based on the experimental measurements on the four @xmath33 mesons ( @xmath110 and @xmath9 ) , we suggested that the basis must be enlarged to include hybrid states to have a unified description of @xmath33 states , the qgh mixing scheme . because there are two independent states @xmath111 and @xmath112 for the hybrids of isospin singlet , we predict existence of an extra @xmath33 meson .",
    "the new state @xmath1 discovered recently by the bes collaboration fits in such a picture very nicely .",
    "based on the ansatz for the mixing pattern of eq.([matrix ] ) in the qgh scheme , we carry out a @xmath113 analysis to obtain the mixing matrix and the concerned parameters in the effective lagrangian for @xmath114 using all avaliable experimental data on the spectra and decay branching ratios of the five members . we obtain a rather satisfactory result with the minimal @xmath113 to be 3.79 for three degrees of freedom .",
    "this fit can explain the relatively large branching ratio of decay mode @xmath115 observed by the bes collaboration @xcite which was supposed to be a double - ozi suppressed process for usual quarkonia state .",
    "it is noticed that after fitting the measured values of spectra and branching ratios , we find that the masses of @xmath116 and @xmath117 in the mixing matrix are close , because the masses of @xmath9 and @xmath1 are not far apart .",
    "that is what the data imply .",
    "the situation for regular @xmath118 system is different , as we obtain by fitting data @xmath119 mev , although in the range of the usual su(3 ) breaking effect . in ref.@xcite the masses of the scalar hybrids in terms of the bag model as 1.51 - 1.90 gev for @xmath41 and 2.0 - 2.1 gev for @xmath42 .",
    "if considering the upper limit , the difference for hybrid states is indeed very small .",
    "the closeness may be understood that due to the gluon existence in the state , the flavor su(3 ) breaking becomes milder .",
    "of course this allegation needs to be tested in the future .    with all the information available",
    ", we have made theoretical predictions on the decay branching ratios of @xmath9 , @xmath1 into two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we find that the main decay channel of @xmath1 are @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "if these predictions are confirmed by experiment , it implies that the main content of @xmath1 is @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the branching ratios of other modes are not too small and have the same order of magnitude as @xmath122 , and can be measured in the future experiments .",
    "instead , among all the decay channels of @xmath123 are relatively small , but @xmath124 would be large . experimentally , the two modes @xmath125 and @xmath126 have been observed , so we suggest our experimental colleagues to measure the channel @xmath127 .    at present , very limited data about the decays of @xmath128 and @xmath1 into two",
    "vector mesons are available , therefore we have made further approximation to estimate related decays by keeping only the main terms @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the effective lagrangian for decay amplitudes . with more data in the future , the relevant parameters can be determined better .      before closing this section",
    "we would like to make some comments on another alternative scenario for @xmath1 , the four - quark state mechanism .",
    "four - quark state can also accommodate new @xmath25 particles@xcite .",
    "an immediate question arises about this scenario is that how many ground states of @xmath25 can be formed with four light quarks and how to identify the dominant component of @xmath1 .",
    "the number of ground states can be easily obtained by looking at the number of isospin @xmath131 states from @xmath132 . here",
    "@xmath133 are color indices .",
    "@xmath134 indicates combination of dirac matrices with appropriate lorentz indices .",
    "we remark that when counting the number of physical @xmath135 states , the states with the same flavor structure should be counted as one state . to find the number of @xmath131 states formed from two quarks ( @xmath136 of su(3 ) ) and two anti - quarks ( @xmath137 of su(3 ) )",
    ", one can decompose @xmath136 and @xmath137 into su(2 ) isospin group to have @xmath138 and @xmath139 and identify the @xmath131 states .",
    "there are , naively , five possible @xmath140 states given by @xmath141 it is clear that @xmath142 is the same as @xmath143 as far as flavor contents are concerned and therefore should be identified as the same which we will denote as @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath145 is the @xmath131 state formed from two @xmath131 @xmath146 structures , and @xmath147 is the @xmath131 state formed from two @xmath148 @xmath146 structures .",
    "if kinematically allowed states are dominated by @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath145 and @xmath151 , should have their dominant decay modes to be of the types : @xmath152 , @xmath153,@xmath154 @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 state , if dominated by a four - quark state , should have large @xmath150 component .",
    "the above discussion shows that if the @xmath1 is a @xmath33 composed of four quarks , there should be another three @xmath33 states .",
    "if these states mix with quarkonia and glueball , then there should be seven @xmath33 states .",
    "interesting enough , these can accommodate @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is different than the qgh mixing scheme where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are left out in the picture which may be accounted for by introducing molecular states .",
    "the detailed mixing is difficult to study due to lack of both experimental and theoretical information .",
    "more theoretical and experimental studies are needed .",
