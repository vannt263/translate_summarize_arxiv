    "over the last few years it has been established the existence of a structural dichotomy between elliptical ( e ) and spheroidal ( sph ) galaxies ( see e.g. kormendy 1985 and binggeli & cameron 1991 ) which suggests different galaxy formation / evolution processes for both kind of galaxies ( dekel & silk 1986 ; guzmn , lucey & bower 1993 ) .",
    "however , this dichotomy contrasts with the remarkable similarity in the global properties of their stellar populations . in particular , the colour - luminosity relation as well as the correlation between the mg@xmath0 line - strength index and velocity dispersion are apparently universal for both galaxy families ( caldwell 1983 ; bender 1991 ) . a detailed comparison of the star - formation histories of sph s and e s is required to provide constraints on their formation mechanisms .",
    "also , understanding the star - formation history of sph s is of vital importance for cosmological issues such as the nature of the faint blue galaxies ( babul & rees 1992 ) or the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "recent studies devoted to compare in detail the stellar populations of sph s and e s have led to ambiguous results so far . for dwarf sph s in the local group",
    ", there is now clear evidence of recent ( i.e. , 3 - 5 gyrs ) star - forming events ( see e.g. da costa 1991 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies have provided evidence that some bright sph s do exhibit a young or intermediate age stellar population ( gregg 1991 ; held & mould 1994 ) . however , the general trend is that bright sph s tend to follow the galactic globular clusters ( ggc s ) locus in the color  line - strength diagrams , but with a large scatter ( bothun & mould 1988 ; brodie & huchra 1991 ; held & mould 1994 ) .",
    "ferguson ( 1994 ) has compared colors and line - strengths for sph s , e s and ggc s with the predictions of stellar population models , concluding that differences in the line - strength  color relations may arise due to calibration problems and the relatively large uncertainties in both the measurements and the population synthesis models . clearly , a systematic study with more precise measurements is needed to derive any serious constraints on the stellar populations of sph galaxies . in this _",
    "letter _ we show the first results of a spectroscopic survey of sph s aimed at studying in detail their stellar populations and kinematics .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on new central measurements of line - strength indices ( namely mg@xmath0 , fe5270 , fe5335 , and h@xmath2 ) and , for the first time , gradients for a sample of six sph s in the virgo cluster .",
    "the galaxy sample listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] includes six bright sph s in the virgo cluster .",
    "long - slit spectroscopic observations were carried out during april 11 - 15 1994 , with the @xmath3 int at la palma .",
    "the ids spectrograph provided 2.5 (fwhm ) resolution spectra in the wavelength range 47006100   .",
    "the slit was aligned with the major axis .",
    "exposure times ( typically @xmath44 hours per galaxy ) allow measurements of spectral features out to the galaxy effective radius @xmath5 .",
    "spectra of the central regions have very high quality ( the signal - to - noise ratio ranges from 32 to 110 ) . a detailed description of the observational setup and reduction procedures will be given in gorgas et al .",
    "we emphasize that , in order to ensure reliable line - strength gradients , the sky was carefully estimated at the slit ends taking into account any possible contribution of the galaxy itself and the effect of scattered light . for each galaxy spectrum",
    "we measured the mg@xmath0 , h@xmath2 , fe5270 , and fe5335 indices .",
    "the errors in these measurements were estimated by reducing , in parallel to the galaxy frames , error images created from photon and readout noises .",
    "since line - strength indices depend on spectral resolution , our spectra were broadened to match the resolution of the widely used lick system ( 200 km s@xmath6 ) . to ensure the accuracy of this correction and check for any systematic errors",
    ", we observed a sample of 39 f  m stars from the lick stellar library ( gorgas et al .",
    "after the broadening correction , we found no systematic deviations for the fe and h@xmath2 indices between both data sets .",
    "the mg@xmath0 index , however , shows a systematic offset of @xmath7 magnitudes ( our values below those of lick ) , which was applied to convert our indices to the lick system .",
    "in table  [ tbl-1 ] we list , for our galaxy sample , the central mg@xmath0 , h@xmath2 and @xmath1 line - strength indices , and their formal errors in a @xmath8 aperture centered on the galaxy nucleus . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we present line - strength diagrams for our sample of sph s as well as for a representative sample of ggc s and e galaxies .",
    "we also show the predictions of single - burst stellar population models of a given age and metallicity ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that , in the mg@xmath0@xmath1 plane , bright sph s do not follow the extrapolation of the e sequence towards lower mg@xmath0 values , but tend to resemble metal - rich ggc s .",
    "the failure to reproduce theoretically the high mg@xmath0 values observed in bright e s has been interpreted to be due to an enhancement of the [ mg / fe ] ratio in these galaxies relative to the solar ratio assumed in the population models ( peletier 1989 ; worthey , faber , & gonzlez 1992 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 , hereafter dsp ) . from fig .",
    "1a , it is clear that the model lines pass through the sph s locus thus suggesting solar abundance [ mg / fe ] ratios for these galaxies .",
    "this difference in [ mg / fe ] between e s and sph s may likely imply different star - formation histories for both galaxy types . if the enhancement of [ mg / fe ] is due to an overabundance of light elements in bright e s , then it is plausible that the star - formation in these galaxies occurred in a short timescale , since mg is created rapidly by type ii sns whilst fe is produced in a longer timescale by type ia sns . under this assumption ,",
    "our observations imply a longer star - formation period in sph s as compared to e s . in other words ,",
    "the star - forming event should have elapsed long enough to yield a solar [ mg / fe ] ratio . however , other factors , such as a flatter imf in giant e s compared to sph s , could account for the mg overabundance difference ( worthey et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the positions of the bright sph s in the @xmath1 @xmath9 diagram also reveal a clear dichotomy in the way sph s and e s populate the age - metallicity plane ( fig .",
    "comparison between the measured indices and the spectral synthesis models in this diagram allow us to break the degeneracy between age and metallicity present in fig .",
    "1a . within the errors ,",
    "bright sph s exhibit a large range of metallicities , from values typical for metal rich ggc s ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) to those for e s .",
    "we note that the derived metallicities for sph s are the same , and lower than for e s , whether computed from mg or fe lines .    concerning the age question , we find that bright sph s span a wide range in mean stellar ages , showing in fact a comparable age spread to that derived , using a similar diagram , by gonzlez ( 1993 , hereafter g93 ) for e galaxies .",
    "most interestingly , we find a trend between age and metallicity , in the sense that `` younger '' sph s tend to be more metal - rich , although the sample is too small to reach a firm conclusion .",
    "it is important to note that the computed ages are light - weighted mean stellar ages .",
    "moreover , since single burst models are probably a naive approximation to the star forming history of early - type galaxies , and given the discrepancies in the derived ages when using different models ( typically @xmath11 gyrs for old populations and metallicities around solar ; cf .",
    "worthey 1994 ; vazdekis et al . 1996 ; see fig  1b ) , it is hard to give any reliable estimate of absolute ages , but the relative trends remain .",
    "perhaps the key question is whether some sph s ( like ugc  7436 and ngc  4431 ) are as old as the oldest e s .",
    "1b suggests that this is the case but this conclusion may be subject to other effects .",
    "since the slope of the constant - age lines ( for old stellar populations ) in the @xmath1h@xmath2 plane is not model dependent , it is hard to reconcile the relative positions of the low - h@xmath2 e s and metal - rich ggc s in this diagram with the idea that both are old and coeval .",
    "vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that the location of those constant - age lines depends on the adopted imf slope ( see fig  1b ) .",
    "therefore , the assumption of a flatter imf for the bright e s would help to explain the position of both populations ( ggc s and low - h@xmath2 e s ) in this diagram without introducing important age differences , accounting at the same time for the mg overabundance effect . under this view",
    ", the stellar populations of all bright sph s of the sample ( with solar mg / fe ratios ) could be significantly younger than ggc s and , therefore , than the oldest bright e s .",
    "an important question raised by ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) is whether the stellar populations of sph s resemble those in the outer regions of e s . using line - strength profiles from g93 , when the comparison is made at constant surface brightness ( @xmath12 mag arcsec@xmath13 , corresponding to the sph mean brightness inside our central aperture ) ,",
    "e galaxies attain typical mg@xmath0 line - strengths of @xmath14 mag , which are significantly larger than those observed for sph s ( see table  1 ) .",
    "therefore , the stellar populations are , again , different and local surface brightness does not seem to be a main parameter in fixing the properties of the stellar populations , suggesting that local stellar populations mostly reflect the global properties ( e.g. mass ) , and only secondarily the local environment .",
    "radial profiles of mg@xmath0 , @xmath1 and h@xmath2 for our galaxy sample are plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "each point along radius corresponds to an average of line - strengths from symmetrical bins at both sides of the galaxy . for the outer regions , we co - added a sufficient number of spectra in the spatial direction to guarantee a minimum signal - to - noise per  , leading to typical errors outside the centers of @xmath15 mag , @xmath16   and @xmath17  .",
    "the gradients have been estimated from the error - weighted linear regression fits over the radial range covering from @xmath18 ( in order to avoid seeing effects ) to the effective radius .    as it is apparent from fig .  2 ,",
    "bright sph s possess shallow mg@xmath0 gradients .",
    "the mean mg@xmath0 gradient ( @xmath19 ) for our sample is @xmath20 , with a r.m.s .",
    "dispersion around the mean of @xmath21 .",
    "this value can be compared with the mean mg@xmath0 gradient derived by gonzlez & gorgas ( 1997 ) using published and unpublished data for @xmath22 early - type galaxies with reliable mg@xmath0 profiles . following a fitting procedure similar to that described above ,",
    "the derived mean mg@xmath0 gradient for e s is @xmath23 , with a scatter of @xmath24 .",
    "applying the mann ",
    "whitney u - test , we conclude that mg@xmath0 gradients in bright sph s are flatter than those in e galaxies at the @xmath25 level of confidence . due to their dependence on spectral resolution and photon noise ,",
    "fe indices are worse determined than mg@xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , fe gradients in bright sph s are also found to be moderately shallow .",
    "the mean @xmath1 gradient for the sample is @xmath26 with a scatter of @xmath27 . combining data from gorgas , efstathiou & aragn - salamanca ( 1990 ) , dsp and g93",
    "we have derived a mean @xmath1 gradient for a sample of @xmath28 e s of @xmath29 ( with a scatter of @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is also steeper than the gradients in our sample of sph s , although at a confidence level of only @xmath31 .",
    "concerning h@xmath2 gradients , it is clear from fig .  2 that almost all bright sph s in our sample exhibit essentially flat gradients in the h@xmath2 strength .",
    "h@xmath2 line - strengths could be affected by filling due to weak nebular emission .",
    "it must be noted , however , that no [ oiii ] @xmath32   emission lines are detectable in the spectra of these galaxies . for our sample , we derive @xmath33 , with a r.m.s scatter of @xmath34 , consistent with a flat mean gradient .",
    "this result agrees with what has been found for this feature in several samples of e galaxies ( gorgas et al .",
    "1990 ; dsp ; g93 ) .",
    "these line - strength gradients should be interpreted in terms of radial variations in mean age and metallicity .",
    "if we assumed that mg@xmath0 gradients are entirely due to metallicity variations within galaxies , then , using worthey ( 1994 ) models , these gradients would translate into a mean @xmath35/\\delta\\log r\\rangle = -0.14\\pm0.04 $ ] , considerably flatter than the mean metallicity gradient , derived in a similar way , for e s ( @xmath36 , gorgas et al .",
    "1990 ; @xmath37 , dsp ; @xmath38 , fisher , franx & illingworth 1995 ) .",
    "the constancy of h@xmath2 along radius in galaxies with negative metallicity gradients has been interpreted , when taking the models literally , as an evidence for age gradients ( g93 ; fisher et al .",
    "this result would also apply to our sample of sph s . although there is a large variation from galaxy to galaxy ,",
    "our data suggest moderate age gradients , in the sense of younger - looking stellar populations in the inner regions relative to the outer parts .",
    "color gradients in sph galaxies have previously been studied by vader at al .",
    "( 1988 ) and chaboyer ( 1994 ) .",
    "their main conclusion is that sph s exhibit shallower gradients than e s , being , in the mean , compatible with a flat b ",
    "r colour gradient .",
    "these results are fully consistent with our line - strength gradients since age and metallicity effects would tend to cancel to yield shallow color gradients .",
    "note that , in the presence of age gradients , the above estimate for the mean metallicity gradient would be in fact underestimated ( by @xmath39 dex ) . in any case , since this would also apply to giant e s , the metallicity gradients in sph s still remain shallower than those in e galaxies .",
    "this result suggests that sn - driven winds , or other heating mechanism , governs the chemical evolution of sph s , reducing the infall of enriched gas towards the galaxy centers and preventing , therefore , the development of steep metallicity gradients .",
    "through the study of absorption features , we present evidence that the dichotomy found between the structural properties of sph s and e s ( e.g. bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) is also observed in the stellar populations .",
    "this dichotomy rests mainly upon the observed differences in mg / fe overabundance , global metallicity and metallicity gradients .",
    "although , in the light of the available stellar population models , these results are still unable to identify unambiguously the differences in the star formation histories of the e and sph families , our suggestion is that , while the bulk of star formation in giant e s occurred in a short timescale and probably with a imf skewed towards higher masses , star formation in sph s has proceeded , self - regulated by galactic winds or other mechanisms , quietly in a longer timescale and with less amount of dissipation .",
    "further work is needed to decide whether this elapsed star - forming period would be able to account for the young mean ages observed in some ( if not all ) sph s or whether subsequent starbursts should be invoked .",
    "it is clear that other important aspects , like the possible differences between the stellar populations of nucleated and non - nucleated sph s and the influence of environment , require further investigation before we can have a more complete picture of the star - formation history in spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee , a. aragn - salamanca , j. gallego and r. peletier for useful comments .",
