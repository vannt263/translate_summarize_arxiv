    "in quantum mechanics , the bohr s complementarity principle for wave - particle duality could be displayed in various double - slit experiments ( dse)@xcite .",
    "it manifests that a detection about which way a particle takes in dse will inevitably destroy quantum interferences , thus the particle behavior(spatially localized ) emerges while wave - like behavior ( interference ) disappears . otherwise , if the detectors ( apparatuses or environments ) can not well distinguish the different possible paths , the interference recovers@xcite .",
    "lots of experiments have tested this duality properties through the which - way detection@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we show the effect of which - way detection in a class of experimentally accessible systems with an inherent structure of the mach - zehnder interferometer where two virtual paths intrinsically are embedded .",
    "we illustrate this observation with the single particle ( photon or phonon ) propagating in a one - dimensional coupled - resonator - array ( cra ) where a localized two - level system ( tls ) simultaneously interacts with the confined em field modes in two nearest resonators ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the transported boson is scattered by the tls when it enters one of these two nearest resonators , and then the transmission / reflection spectrum will exhibit the interference pattern of the twice scatterings .",
    "one may superpose these two local em modes according to their couplings to the tls ( as illustrated in fig . [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "their anti - bonding superposition is decoupled with the tls , while the only interaction between the bonding superposition and tls makes a which - way detection for the two virtual paths corresponding to the bonding and anti - bonding modes . in this inherent mach - zehnder interferometer with which - way detector by the tls , as the coupling strength increases gradually",
    ", the intrinsic interference in the scattering spectrum ( the reflection and transmission spectra ) will disappear progressively .",
    "the reason is that the which - way detection only observes the particle motion in the anti - bonding branch .",
    "therefore the de - interference phenomenon for a single particle scattering is understood in terms of the inherent mach - zehnder interferometer under the intrinsic `` which - way '' detection , which seems absent in the real configuration .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model for demonstrating the mach - zehnder interference . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pro ] , we study the single photon propagation properties on this structure . the physical mechanism of the observed phenomena is explored in sec .",

    "sec : concl ] .",
    "the present system consists of cra and a side - coupled tls .",
    "in contrast to the previous model@xcite , the tls is coupled to two modes supported by two nearest resonators , as illustrated in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the cra is described by the model hamiltonian under the nearest - neighbor approximation @xmath0with the annihilation / creation operator @xmath1 of a confined boson ( photon in a single mode cavity or cooled phonon in a nano - mechanical resonator ) in the jth resonant cavity mode .",
    "this is a typical tight - binding boson model . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that all cavities have the same eigenfrequency @xmath2 and the intercavity coupling has the same strength @xmath3 . in this array , waves propagate freely and are characterized by the dispersion relation @xmath4which forms a frequency band in a continuum spectrum .",
    "the tls with the ground state @xmath5 , excited state @xmath6 and energy level - spacing @xmath7 , is coupled to two nearest cavities of the 1d cra with corresponding strengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 . under the rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "the dynamics of the tls interacting with the electromagnetic field is described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian@xmath10where the first term describes the free energy of the tls with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and its adjoint @xmath13 are the corresponding lowing and rising operator .",
    "we remark that the present model can be physically implemented with nano - electrimechanical resonator array or defect resonator array on photonic crystal .",
    "the detailed discription will be presented in sec .",
    "sec : physical - implementations .",
    "it is clear that the number of excitations is conserved in this hybrid system . in the one - excitation subspace ,",
    "two mutually exclusive possibilities are considered : the particle is either propagating inside the cavity , or absorbed by the tls .",
    "it indicates that the eigenstate has the form @xmath14.\\]]from the schrdinger equation ( @xmath15 , we derive a series of coupled stationary equations for the excited - state amplitude @xmath16 and the amplitudes @xmath17 of single - photon states@xcite in the @xmath18 cavity . here , the part concerning excited - state @xmath19leads to dispersive coupling strength between the 0th and 1st resonators , and a non - local effective potential @xmath20which is proportional to the green function @xmath21 .",
    "the single excitation transport is described by the discrete scattering equation@xmath22the first term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ ww1 ] ) charactrizes the hopping between different sites as the kinetic term . and the double delta potentials in the send term are induced from the couplings between the tls and the cra",
    ". however , such delta potentials are nonlocal comparing with the one - site coupling in ref .",
    "therefore , the coherent scattering by the two sites will bring different physical effect .",
    "the process that an incident wave impinges upon the structure , where transmitted and reflected wave emerge , is formulated by assuming @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 with reflection and transmission amplitudes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . concerning eq .",

    "( [ ww1 ] ) to the resonators far away from the resonators at @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "it is checked that the reflection coefficient @xmath34 and transmission coefficient @xmath35 satisfy the identity @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that , in eq .",
    "( [ ww3 - 6 ] ) and  ( [ ww3 - 7 ] ) , the transmission generally vanishes at the band edges with @xmath37 .",
    "however , constructive interference is found at @xmath38 when @xmath39 ( red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . compared with the case of one - site coupling ( solid dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , the transmission does not vanishes at @xmath40 with a nonvanishing amplitude @xmath41 due to the `` non - local '' coupling between the tls and cra . obviously , the position of transmission zero is shifted to @xmath42 .",
    "when the coupling gets stronger , the transmission dip gradually moves outside the spectrum band , thus no transmission zero appears , as shown in fig .",
    "the coupling between the tls and cra induces the effective double delta potentials in the way of photon propagation .",
    "the strength tends to infinite potentials at @xmath43 , which indicates the total reflection .",
    "however , the straightforward physics picture fails to explain the nonvanishing transmission at @xmath43 in the case of nonlocal coupling .",
    "to give an intuitionistic explanation about the nonvanishing point of transmission , we now introduce the bonding and anti - bonding modes @xmath44 where @xmath45 . when @xmath39 , the modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 presents two virtual paths without direct coupling between each other , then the cra virtually becomes an equivalent mach - zehnder interferometer ( see the fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) where the arm @xmath46 is experienced a which - way measurement by the tls .",
    "those cavities on the left of the cavity at @xmath32 or the right of the cavity at @xmath48 are regarded as the left and right leads , which are connected to each other via two arms .",
    "the lower arm corresponds to the anti - bonding model @xmath47 of eigenfrequency @xmath49 , while the upper arm to the bonding mode @xmath46 of eigenfrequency @xmath50 coupling to the tls with coupling strength @xmath51 .",
    "the effective hopping strengthes between the bonding mode @xmath46 and nearby cavities are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "it is emphasized that anti - bonding mode @xmath47 is indeed decoupled with the tls .    in the above equivalent configuration ,",
    "the propagating state is a superposition of four mutually exclusive possibilities : i ) the particle propagating inside left and right leads , represent by the state @xmath54 with possibility amplitude @xmath17 ; ii ) absorbed by the tls , by @xmath55 ; iii ) propagating from the left to right lead via the upper arm , by @xmath56 with amplitude @xmath57 , or iv ) via the lower am , by @xmath58 with amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "the superposition of these four possibilities forms a stationary state @xmath60 with the band energy @xmath61 . here",
    ", three scattering channels are implied , i.e. , single particle travels through the excited tls or via the bonding and anti - bonding branches respectively with the tls unexcited .",
    "in the reduced dimensionality , particles follow two different paths defined by two virtual modes .",
    "we refer to these two paths as path b and d corresponding to the b - slit and d - slit .",
    "a dispersion delta potential is localized in path b since particle passing the b - slit will interact with the tls .",
    "the total transmission amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes in the two branches , and the interference pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two paths .",
    "therefore , the suppression of quantum interference depends on the dwell time of the single particle absorbed by the tls .     as a function of the photon incident energy @xmath62 .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath63 for black dotted line , @xmath64 for red solid line , @xmath65 for green dot - dashed line , and @xmath66 for blue dashed line.,width=283 ]    an incoming wave with energy @xmath61 , incident from the left lead , is split into two branches at the first junction and joins again into the outgoing wave at the second junction .",
    "the single particle propagating around the ring ( consists of sites @xmath67 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) is described as follows : the discrete scattering equation in the path @xmath46 @xmath68which is coupled with the local atomic excitation characterized by @xmath69 in the path @xmath47 , the particle propagates freely with motion equation @xmath70 . however , on the nodes with@xmath71 , the amplitudes for the single particle is coupled to those two splitting nodes @xmath46 and @xmath47 with the following forms respectively @xmath72then , it follows from the above discrete scattering equation that  the transmission amplitude @xmath73 @xmath74 is given by the partial wave transmission amplitude @xmath75 and @xmath76respectively in path d ( b ) in the absence of path b ( d ) .    . its contour plot with respect to @xmath61 and coupling strength @xmath77",
    "all parameters are in units of @xmath78 .",
    ", width=283 ]    when the incident single particle is resonant to the tls , the spontaneous emission from the tls and the propagating modes in the 1d continuum lead to the complete suppression of the wave transmission in path b , then photons take path d. therefore , the tls prevents single - particle interference of paths b and d. in this sense , the tls serves as a which - path detector .",
    "it is the potential exerted by the tls that makes waves accumulate a phase on path b , then the wave interference of paths b and d displays a transmission zero in @xmath73 .",
    "however , the coupling strength characterizes the time that the single quantum dwells in the tls .",
    "consequently , the interference pattern is expected to diminish as the coupling strength increases .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the contour plots of transmission coefficient @xmath79 as a function of the incident energy @xmath61 and coupling strength @xmath77 . here",
    ", we can see that as the coupling strength @xmath77 increases the complete suppression of the wave transmission begins at @xmath43 , gradually shifts to the band edge , and then disappears .",
    "one may also find that the perfect transmission at @xmath38 is independent of the potential exerted by the tls .",
    "when @xmath38 , the probability amplitudes @xmath80 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , lead to destructive interference at b - slit since @xmath83 , and constructive interference at d - slit . in this case , the tls is effectively decoupled from the cra .",
    "the above `` non - local '' coupling obviously distinguishes the present investigation from previous extensive ones  fanprl95,zhouprl101,zhoupra74,necs2010 where the tls only couples with the em field in a single cavity .",
    "experimentally , the previous setups are feasible implemented with the confined photon or the single mode phonon in some confined nano - structures  @xcite , e.g. , the circuit qed system , a semiconductor quantum dot coupling with nanoscale surface plasmons or the defect cavities of photonic crystal , and the nano - electromechanical resonator arrays where every resonator is coupled to a localized spin  nanotip . to implement the present `` non - local '' coupling seems difficult in the photonic cra , but it could be feasible for the nano - electromechanical resonator array coupled to a local spin , where two of the resonators are attached by magnetic tips producing magnetic fields in the x - direction ( see the fig . [ fig4 ] ) . with the charged resonators oscillating in the z - direction , and under the rotating - wave approximation , the inter - resonator coupling is realized via coulomb forces  @xcite , while two of them simultaneously interacts with a single spin through the magnetic - field gradients @xcite . in nano - electromechanical resonator experiments ,",
    "the parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 can easily reach a million hertz frequency scale , and the cavity - tls coupling strength is in the order of 100khz .",
    "the second implementation of the `` non - local coupling '' could be in a 2d photonic crystal  @xcite , which is made up of a square lattice of high - index dielectric rods , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . here ,",
    "two nearest cavities in a waveguide of coupled defected cavity arrays is coupled to a side defected cavity . in the single excitation subspace , the side cavity with two states ( vacuum and single photon ) simulates the tls in our general setup .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the effect of which - way detection inherent to a class of experimentally accessible systems with some intrinsic mach - zehnder interferometer configuration to enjoy the quantum / classical interference of two virtual paths .",
    "this observation is used to explain the discovered progressive de - interference in the transmission spectrum of single photons propagating in 1d cra , as the non - local couplings of a tls to two nearest resonators increases its strength gradually . besides the quantum realizations with the nano - electromechanical resonator arrays where two nearest resonators with magnetic tips simultaneously interact with a single spin ,",
