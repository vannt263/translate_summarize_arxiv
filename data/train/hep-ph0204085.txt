    "one of the pressing open problems in particle physics is to understand the origin of @xmath0 violation phase and family mixing . in the minimal standard model ( sm )",
    "the information about these quantities is encoded in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix . in this work",
    "we shall denote this matrix by @xmath2    as it is well known , some of the entries of this matrix are remarkably well measured , while others ( such as the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 elements ) are poorly known and the only real experimental constraint come from the unitarity requirements .",
    "a lot of effort in the last decade has been invested in this particular problem and this dedication will continue in the foreseeable future aiming to a precision in the charged current sector comparable to the one already reached in the neutral sector . as a guidance ,",
    "let us mention that the expected accuracy in @xmath6 after lhcb is expected to be beyond the 1% level , and a comparable accuracy is expected by that time from the ongoing generation of experiments ( babar , belle ) @xcite .    in the neutral sector",
    "it is totally mandatory to include electroweak radiative corrections to bring theory and experiment into agreement .",
    "tree level results are incompatible with experiment by many standard deviations @xcite",
    ". obviously we are not there yet in the charged current sector , but in a few years electroweak radiative corrections will be required in the studies analysing the `` unitarity '' of the ckm matrix .",
    "these corrections are of several types . with an on - shell scheme in mind",
    ", we need counter terms for the electric charge , weinberg angle and wave - function renormalisation ( wfr . ) for the @xmath7 gauge boson .",
    "we shall also require wfr .",
    "for the external fermions and counter terms for the entries of the ckm matrix .",
    "the latter are in fact related in a way that will be described below @xcite .",
    "finally one needs to compute the 1pi vertex parts of the different processes one is interested in .",
    "in the on - shell scheme , all counter terms can be expressed as combinations of self - energies @xcite .",
    "these are standard and well known at one - loop in perturbation theory ; in some cases , at least for the leading pieces , up to two - loop in the sm .",
    "however , a long standing controversy exists in the literature concerning what is the appropriate way to define both an external wfr . and ckm counter terms .",
    "the issue becomes involved because we are dealing with particles which are unstable ( and therefore the self - energies develop branch cuts ; even gauge dependent ones in the sm ) and because of mixing .",
    "several proposals have been put forward in the literature to define appropriate counter terms both for the external legs and for the ckm matrix elements . the original prescription for wfr . diagonalizing the on - shell",
    "propagator was introduced in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "`` satisfying '' the conditions of @xcite were derived .",
    "however since @xcite does not take care about the branch cuts present in the self - energies those results must be considered only consistent up to absorptive terms .",
    "later it was realized @xcite that the on - shell conditions defined in @xcite where inconsistent and in fact impossible to satisfy for a minimal set of renormalisation constants and @xmath8 are related by @xmath9 due to the imaginary branch cuts present in the self - energies .",
    "the author of @xcite circumvented this problem by introducing a prescription that _ de facto _ eliminates such branch cuts , but at the price of not diagonalizing the propagators in flavour space .",
    "ward identities based on the su(2)@xmath10 gauge symmetry relate wfr . and",
    "counter terms for the ckm matrix elements @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was seen that if the prescription of @xcite was used in the counter terms for the ckm matrix elements , the results were in violation of gauge invariance .",
    "as we have just mentioned , the results in @xcite do not deal properly with the absorptive terms appearing in the self - energies ; which in addition happen to be gauge dependent . in spite of the problems with the prescription for the wfr . given in @xcite ,",
    "the conclusions reached in @xcite are correct : a necessary condition for gauge invariance of the physical amplitudes is that counter terms for the ckm matrix elements @xmath2 are by themselves gauge independent .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by the ckm counter term proposed in @xcite as it is in minimal subtraction @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other proposals to handle ckm renormalisation exist in the literature @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in all these works either the external wfr .",
    "proposed originally in @xcite or @xcite are used , or the issue is sidestepped altogether . in either case the absorptive part of the self - energies ( and even the absorptive part of the 1pi vertex part in one particular instance @xcite ) are not taken into account . as we shall see doing so leads to physical amplitudes  @xmath11-matrix elements which are gauge dependent , and this irrespective of the method one uses to renormalise @xmath2 provided the redefinition of @xmath2 is gauge independent and preserves unitarity .    due to the structure of the imaginary branch cuts",
    "it turns out however , that the gauge dependence present in the amplitude using the prescription of @xcite cancels in the modulus squared of the physical @xmath11-matrix element in the sm .",
    "this cancellation has been checked numerically by the authors in @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall provide analytical results showing that this cancellation is exact .",
    "however the gauge dependence remains at the level of the amplitude .",
    "is this acceptable ?",
    "we do not think so .",
    "diagrams contributing to the same physical process outside the sm electroweak sector may interfere with the sm amplitude and reveal the unwanted gauge dependence .",
    "furthermore , gauge independent absorptive parts are also discarded by the prescription in @xcite .",
    "these parts , contrary to the gauge dependent ones , do not drop in the squared amplitude as we shall show .",
    "in addition , one should not forget that the scheme in @xcite does not deliver on - shell renormalised propagators that are diagonal in flavour space .",
    "this work is dedicated to substantiate the above claims .",
    "we shall compute the gauge dependence of the absorptive parts in the self - energies and the vertex functions .",
    "we shall see how the requirements of gauge invariance and proper on - shell conditions ( including exact diagonalisation in flavour space ) single out a unique prescription for the wfr .",
    "the problem is presented in detail in the next section .",
    "the explicit expressions for the renormalisation constants are given in sections [ offdiagonal ] and [ diagonal ] .",
    "implementation for @xmath7 and top decay are shown in section [ wandtdecay ] .",
    "a technical discussion where extended use of the nielsen identities has been done to extract the gauge dependence of all absorptive terms is presented in section [ nielsen ] and it can be omitted by readers not interested in these details . in section [ absorptive ] and [ cp ]",
    "we return to @xmath7 and top decay to implement the previous results and finally we conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "we want to define an on - shell renormalisation scheme that guarantees the correct properties of the fermionic propagator in the @xmath12 limit and at the same time renders the observable quantities calculated in such a scheme gauge parameter independent . in the first place",
    "up and down - type propagators have to be family diagonal on - shell .",
    "the conditions necessary for that purpose were first given by aoki et .",
    "al . in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce some notation in order to write them down .",
    "we renormalise the bare fermion fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 for reasons that will become clear along the discussion , we shall allow @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be independent renormalisation constants .",
    "these renormalisation constants contain flavour , family and dirac indices .",
    "we can decompose them into @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the up and down flavour projectors and furthermore each piece in left and right chiral projectors , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , @xmath23 analogous decompositions hold for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "due to radiative corrections the propagator mixes fermion of different family indices .",
    "namely @xmath26 where the bare self - energy @xmath27 is non - diagonal and is given by @xmath281pi .",
    "within one - loop accuracy we can write @xmath29 etc . introducing the family indices explicitly we have @xmath30 where the one - loop renormalised self - energy is given by @xmath31 since we can project the above definition for up and down type - quarks , flavour indices will be dropped in the sequel and only will be restored when necessary .",
    "recalling the following on - shell relations for dirac spinors ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 the conditions @xcite necessary to avoid mixing will be    @xmath34    where no summation over repeated indices is assumed and @xmath35 these relations determine the non - diagonal parts of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as will be proven in the next section . here , as a side remark ,",
    "let us point out that the need of different `` incoming '' and `` outgoing '' wfr .",
    "constants was already recognised in @xcite . nevertheless , that paper was unsuccessful in reconciling the on - shell prescription with the presence of absorptive terms in the self - energies . however , since its results are concerned with the leading contribution of an effective lagrangian , no absorptive terms are present and therefore conclusions still hold .    to obtain the diagonal parts @xmath36 @xmath37 , and @xmath38",
    "one imposes mass pole and unit residue conditions ( to be discussed below ) . here",
    "it is worth to make one important comment regarding the above conditions .",
    "first of all we note that in the literature the relation @xmath39 is taken for granted .",
    "this relation is tacitly assumed in @xcite and explicitly required in @xcite .",
    "imposing eq .",
    "( [ hermiticity ] ) would guarantee hermiticity of the lagrangian written in terms of the renormalised physical fields .",
    "however , we are at this point concerned with external leg renormalisation , for which it is perfectly possible to use a different set of renormalisation constants ( even ones that do not respect the requirement ( [ hermiticity ] ) ) , while keeping the lagrangian hermitian .",
    "in fact , using two sets of renormalisation constants is a standard practice in the on - shell scheme @xcite , so one should not be concerned by this fact _ per se_. in case one is worried about the consistency of using a set of wfr .",
    "constants not satisfying ( [ hermiticity ] ) for the external legs while keeping a hermitian lagrangian , it should be pointed out that there is a complete equivalence between the set of renormalisation constants we shall find out below and a treatment of the external legs where diagrams with self - energies ( including mass counter terms ) are inserted instead of the wfr .",
    "constants ; provided , of course , that the mass counter term satisfy the on - shell condition . proceeding in this way",
    "gives results identical to ours and different from those obtained using the wfr .",
    "proposed in @xcite , which do fulfil ( [ hermiticity ] ) .",
    "further consistency checks are presented in the following sections .    in any case ,",
    "self - energies develop absorptive terms and this makes eq .",
    "( [ hermiticity ] ) incompatible with the diagonalizing conditions ( [ inparticle])-([outantiparticle ] ) .",
    "therefore in order to circumvent this problem one can give up diagonalisation conditions ( [ inparticle])-([outantiparticle ] ) or alternatively the hermiticity condition ( [ hermiticity ] ) . the approach taken originally in @xcite and works thereafter",
    "was the former alternative , while in this work we shall advocate the second one .",
    "the approach of @xcite consists in dropping out absorptive terms from conditions ( [ inparticle])-([outantiparticle ] ) .",
    "that is for @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 includes the real part of the logarithms arising in loop integrals appearing in the self - energies but not of the rest of coupling factors of the feynmann diagram .",
    "this approach is compatible with the hermiticity condition ( [ hermiticity ] ) but on the other hand have several drawbacks .",
    "these drawbacks include    1 .   since only the @xmath42 part of the self - energies enters into the diagonalizing conditions the on - shell propagator remains non - diagonal .",
    "the very definition of @xmath42 relies heavily on the one - loop perturbative calculation where it is applied upon . in other words",
    "@xmath42 is not a proper function of its argument ( in contrast to @xmath43 ) and it is presumably cumbersome to implement in multi - loop calculations .",
    "3 .   as it will become clear in next sections , the on - shell scheme based in the @xmath42 prescription leads to gauge parameter dependent physical amplitudes .",
    "the reason for this unwanted dependence is the dropping of absorptive gauge parameter dependent terms in the self - energies that are necessary to cancel absorptive terms appearing in the vertices .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the sm , the gauge dependence drops in the modulus squared of the amplitude , but not in the amplitude itself and it could be eventually observable .    once stated the unwanted features of the @xmath42 approach let us briefly state the consequences of dropping condition ( [ hermiticity ] )    1 .   conditions ( [ inparticle])-([outantiparticle ] ) readily determine the off - diagonal @xmath16 and @xmath17 wfr . which coincide with the ones obtained using the @xmath42 prescription up to finite absorptive gauge parameter dependent terms .",
    "the renormalised fermion propagator becomes exactly diagonal on - shell , unlike in the @xmath42 scheme .",
    "incoming and outgoing particles and anti - particles require different renormalisation constants when computing a physical amplitude .",
    "annihilation of particles and creation of anti - particles are accompanied by the renormalisation constant @xmath16 , while creation of particles and annihilation of anti - particles are accompanied by the renormalisation constant @xmath17 .",
    "4 .   these constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 are in what respects to their dispersive parts identical to the ones in @xcite .",
    "they differ in their absorptive parts .",
    "this might suggest to the alert reader there could be problems with fundamental symmetries such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "we shall discuss this issue at the end of the paper .",
    "our conclusion is that everything works out consistently in this respect .    for explicit expressions for @xmath16 and",

    "this immediately brings about some gauge _ independent _ absorptive parts which appear even in the modulus squared amplitude and which are neglected in the treatment of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these parts ( and the gauge dependent ones ) can not be absorbed in unitary redefinitions of the ckm matrix which are the only ones allowed by ward identities .",
    "we have checked that although unconventional the presence of the absorptive parts in the wfr .",
    "constants is perfectly compatible with basic tenets of field theory and the standard model .",
    "numerically we have found the differences to be important , at the order of the half per cent .",
    "small , but relevant in the future .",
    "this information will be relevant to extract the experimental values of the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "traditionally , wave function renormalisation seems to have been the `` poor relative '' in the standard model renormalisation program .",
    "we have seen here that it is important on two counts .",
    "first because it is related to the counter terms for the ckm mixing matrix , although the on - shell values for wave function constants can not be directly used there .",
