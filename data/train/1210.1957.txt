    "most of the divincenzo criteria , which state physical requirements a system must fulfill to achieve quantum computing , have been achieved with spin qubits , including initialization  @xcite , readout  @xcite , and coherent control  @xcite . while experimental progress has been impressive , many of these methods are not yet accurate enough to allow large scale quantum computing with single spins .",
    "a key challenge can be appreciated by considering the relevant timescales associated with the spin dynamics . in gaas",
    "quantum dot devices , it is well known that the hyperfine interaction leads to a randomly fluctuating nuclear field , @xmath0 @xmath1 mt , which results in a @xmath2@xmath3 ns inhomogeneous spin dephasing time  @xcite .",
    "for comparison , the rabi period obtained in a gaas double quantum dot ( dqd ) using conventional electron spin resonance ( esr ) is on the order of @xmath4 ns  @xcite .",
    "the use of spin - orbit driven electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) in gaas leads to even slower rabi periods of roughly @xmath5 ns  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "in the case of single spin rotations , gate operation times are nearly an order of magnitude slower than the inhomogeneous spin dephasing time .",
    "this issue is not specific to gaas based nanostructures . in inas nanowires , where the spin - orbit interaction is larger than in gaas , a rabi period of @xmath6  @xcite was reported .",
    "however , it still is twice as long as the spin dephasing time of @xmath7 .",
    "viewed from a different perspective , the maximum ac field generated in dqd esr experiments is on the order of @xmath8 mt , which is the same magnitude as the fluctuating nuclear field  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "single spin rotations in gaas qubits follow imperfect trajectories on the bloch sphere , resulting in a reduced oscillation visibility and gate errors  @xcite .",
    "single spin selectivity imposes an additional challenge upon the development of a spin - based quantum processor .",
    "magnetic fields generated in esr are difficult to localize on the nanometer scale . without g - factor control , or local magnetic field gradients ,",
    "the spins located in a quantum register would rotate at the same rate in the presence of a global esr field .",
    "the long term goal is to be able to drive selective single spin rotations , without affecting neighboring spins that are on average only @xmath3@xmath9 nm away .    instead of using the spin - up and spin - down states of a single electron ,",
    "the qubit basis states can be represented by two ( out of four ) two - electron spin states confined in a dqd  @xcite . for a qubit",
    "whose basis states are encoded in the singlet @xmath10 and triplet @xmath11 spin states of a dqd , the two - electron exchange interaction allows for fast single - qubit gates ( hundreds of picoseconds )  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have also demonstrated the possibility of realizing a conditional two - qubit gate . within this two - spin version of a qubit ,",
    "the two - qubit gate realized in ref .",
    "can be interpreted as a single qubit operation .",
    "however the exchange interaction only allows for rotations about a single axis , whereas to generate arbitrary rotations one needs two perpendicular rotation axes .",
    "the generation of a nuclear magnetic field gradient  @xcite provides rotations about a second , non - collinear axis . while remarkable , this method also presents some difficulties when it has to be extended to a large number of qubits .",
    "it requires that the nuclear polarization is controlled in each dqd to create the desired gradient field .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the generation of the nuclear field gradient reduces nuclear spin fluctuations , resulting in an increase in the spin dephasing time  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed to use a two - spin basis consisting of the singlet @xmath10 and triplet @xmath12 spin states  @xcite .",
    "quantum control of the @xmath10-@xmath12 qubit relies on landau - zener - stckelberg - majorana  @xcite ( lzsm ) physics , which occurs in the system when the @xmath10-@xmath12 qubit is repeatedly swept through the hyperfine mediated @xmath10-@xmath12 anti - crossing .",

    "we develop a quantum master equation to describe partial adiabatic passages between the spin singlet @xmath10 and triplet @xmath12 states in the presence of both the fluctuating overhauser field and the fluctuating charge environment . with our theory",
    ", we show charge dynamics can significantly hinder lzsm interferometry of spin states . while most of the interesting spin dynamics happens in the @xmath13 charge configuration , with one electron per dot , initialization and measurements",

    "[ sec : results ] , we first compare solutions of the master equation obtained with exprimental pulse profiles and measurements performed on a gaas double quantum dot .",
    "we then show theory results for the singlet return probability for which we explore the effects of charge induced decoherence .",

    "the most common example is rabi s formula  @xcite which describes the occupation of a two - level system that is driven by a coherent field . in quantum information science , rabi oscillations",
    "are widely used , e.g. , to manipulate an electron spin confined in a qd  @xcite .",
