    "the strength of chiral interactions goes with derivatives of pion fields which allows one to organize a perturbative expansion in powers of pion momentum and mass  the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt )  @xcite .",
    "the small expansion parameter is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the momentum and @xmath6 gev stands for the scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "based on this expansion one should be able to systematically compute the pion - mass dependence of static quantities , such as nucleon mass , magnetic moments , as well as the momentum dependence of scattering processes , such as pion - pion and pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "this is an effective - field theory ( eft ) expansion , in this case a low - energy expansion of qcd .",
    "one expects to obtain exactly the same answers as from qcd directly , provided the low - energy constants ( lecs )  the parameters of the effective lagrangian  are known , either from experiment or by matching to qcd itself ( _ e.g. _ , by fitting to the lattice qcd results ) .",
    "one of the principal ingredients of an eft expansion is _ power counting_. the power counting assigns an order to feynman graphs arising in loopwise expansion of the amplitudes , and thus defines which graphs need to be computed at a given order in the expansion . in a way it simply is a tool to estimate the size of different contributions without doing explicit calculations .",
    "the main requirement on a power - counting scheme is that it should estimate the relative size of various contributions correctly . in @xmath3pt with pions and nucleons alone",
    "@xcite , the power counting for a graph with @xmath7 loops , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) internal pion ( nucleon ) lines , and @xmath10 vertices from @xmath11th - order lagrangian , estimates its contribution to go as @xmath12 , with the power given by : n _ = 4 l - 2 n_- n_n + _ k k v_k .",
    "note that in the manifestly lorentz - covariant formalism this power counting holds only in a specific renormalization scheme  @xcite .",
    "a cornerstone principle of effective field theories in general is _ naturalness _ , meaning that the dimensionless lecs must be of natural size , _",
    "i.e. _ , of order of unity .",
    "any significant fine - tuning of even a single lec leads , obviously , to a break - down of the eft expansion . therefore , even if an eft describes the experimental data , but at the expense of fine - tuned lecs , the eft expansion fails .",
    "such an eft can still be useful for getting insights into the physics beyond the eft itself .",
    "namely , by looking at the form of the fine - tuned operators , one might be able to deduce which contributions are missing .",
    "for instance , it is known that the nlo @xmath3pt description of the pion - nucleon elastic scattering , near threshold , requires relatively large values for some of the lecs .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the operators corresponding with those unnatural lecs can be matched to the `` integrated out '' @xmath13-resonance contributions .",
    "the problem is that the @xmath13 is relatively light , its excitation energy , @xmath14 gev , is still quite small compared to @xmath15 gev .",
    "integrating out the @xmath13-isobar degrees of freedom corresponds to an expansion in powers of @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , which certainly is not as good of an expansion as the one in the meson sector , in powers of @xmath4 .",
    "the fine - tuning of the `` deltaless '' @xmath3pt seems to be lifted by the inclusion of an explicit @xmath13-isobar .",
    "also , the limit of applicability of the eft expansion is then extended to momenta of order of the resonance excitation energy , @xmath18 .",
    "such momenta can still be considered as soft , as long as @xmath19 can be treated as small .",
    "the resulting @xmath3pt with pion , nucleon , and @xmath13-isobar degrees of freedom has two distinct light scales : @xmath20 and @xmath13 .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward way to proceed is to organize a simultaneous expansion in two different small parameters : @xmath21 however , for power counting purposes it is certainly more convenient to have a single small parameter and thus a relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is usually imposed .",
    "we stress that the relation is established only at the level of power counting and not in the actual calculations of graphs . at present",
    "two such relations between @xmath22 and @xmath23 are used in the literature :    * @xmath24 , the so - called `` small scale expansion ''  @xcite , here refered to as the `` @xmath22-expansion '' ; + * @xmath25 , the `` @xmath23-expansion ''  @xcite .",
    "the table below ( ) summarizes the counting of momenta in the three expansions : deltaless ( @xmath26-@xmath3pt ) , @xmath22-expansion , and @xmath23-expansion .",
    ".the counting of momenta in the three different @xmath3eft expansions .

    "the @xmath36 transition can be induced by a pion or a photon .",
    "the correponding effective lagrangians are written as :    ^(1)_n & = & n t^a ^ ( _ _ ) _ ^a + , + ^(2)_n & = & n t^3 ( _ _ ) f^ + , + ^(3)_n & = & n t^3 _ 5 f^+ ,    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 stand respectively for the nucleon ( spinor , isodublet ) , @xmath0-isobar ( vector - spinor , isoquartet ) , pion ( pseudoscalar , isovector ) fields ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electromagnetic field strength and its dual , @xmath42 are the isospin-1/2-to-3/2 transition @xmath43 ) matrices .",

    "let us consider this process to nlo in the @xmath23 expansion . since we are using the one - photon - exchange approximation , transition see refs .",
    "the pion photoproduction can be viewed as the particular case of electroproduction at @xmath50 .",
    "the pion electroproduction amplitude to nlo in the @xmath23-expansion , in the resonance region , is given by the graphs in , where the shaded blob in the 3rd graph denotes the nlo @xmath34 vertex , given by the graphs in .",

    "all the other graphs in are of nlo@xmath52 .",

    "the @xmath13 self - energy in these graphs is included , respectively , to nlo .",
    "the vector - meson diagram , ( 2 ) , contributes to nlo for @xmath54 .",
    "one includes it effectively by giving the @xmath45-term a dipole @xmath55-dependence ( in analogy to how it is usually done for the nucleon isovector form factor ) : g_m .",
    "the analogous effect for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 couplings begins at n@xmath56lo .",
    "an important observation is that at @xmath50 only the imaginary part ( unitarity cut ) of the loop graphs in contributes to the nlo amplitude .",
    "their real - part contributions , after the renormalization of the lecs , begin to contribute at n@xmath56lo , for @xmath57 . at present",
    "we will consider only the nlo calculation where the @xmath58-loop contributions to the @xmath34-vertex are omitted since they do not give the imaginary contributions in the @xmath13-resonance region .",

    "as is seen from the figure , the nlo results ( solid curves ) give a good description of the energy dependence of the resonant multipoles in a window of 100 mev around the @xmath0-resonance position .",

    "in the  calculations , the low - energy constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 , were fixed from the resonant pion photoproduction multipoles . therefore , the only other low - energy constant from the chiral lagrangian entering the nlo calculation is @xmath47 .",

    "a best description of the @xmath82 data at low @xmath55 is obtained by choosing @xmath83 .    from the figure one sees that the nlo  calculation , within its accuracy , is consistent with the experimental data for these observables at low @xmath55 .",
    "the dynamical models are in basic agreement with each other and the data for the transverse cross sections .",
    "differences between the models do show up in the @xmath81 and @xmath84 cross sections which involve the longitudinal amplitude .",
    "in particular for @xmath84 the differences reflect to a large extent how the non - resonant @xmath85 multipole is described in the models .",
    "since the low - energy constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 have been fixed , our calculation can provide a prediction for the @xmath20 dependence of the @xmath86 transition form factors .",

    "accounting for the @xmath20-dependence in @xmath93 and @xmath94 , significantly affects @xmath88 .",
    "the   calculation , with the @xmath20 dependence of @xmath95 and @xmath94 included , is in a qualitatively good agreement with the lattice data shown in the figure .",
    "the  result also follows an approximately linear behavior in @xmath96 , although it falls about 10 - 15 % below the lattice data .",
    "this is just within the uncertainty of the nlo results .",
    "one should also keep in mind that the present lattice simulations are not done in full qcd , but are `` quenched '' , so discrepancies are not unexpected .    in",
    ", we show the @xmath20-dependence of the ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 and compare them to lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the recent state - of - the - art lattice calculations of @xmath97 and @xmath98  @xcite use a _ linear _ , in the quark mass ( @xmath99 ) , _ extrapolation _ to the physical point , thus assuming that the non - analytic @xmath100-dependencies are negligible . the thus obtained value for @xmath98 at the physical @xmath20 value displays a large discrepancy with the experimental result , as seen in .",
    "our calculation , on the other hand , shows that the non - analytic dependencies are _ not _ negligible .",
    "while at larger values of @xmath20 , where the @xmath0 is stable , the ratios display a smooth @xmath20 dependence , at @xmath101 there is an inflection point , and for @xmath102 the non - analytic effects are crucial , as was also observed for the @xmath13-resonance magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "one also sees from that , unlike the result for @xmath88 , there is little difference between the   calculations with the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath93 and @xmath94 accounted for , and our earlier calculation @xcite , where the ratios were evaluated neglecting the @xmath20-dependence of the masses .",
    "this is easily understood , as the main effect due to the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath93 and @xmath94 arises due to a common factor in the evaluation of the @xmath86 form factors , which drops out of the ratios .",
    "one can speculate that the `` quenching '' effects drop out , at least partially , from the ratios as well .",
    "in we also show the @xmath20-dependence of the @xmath103 transition ratios , with the theoretical error band .",
    "the @xmath20 dependence obtained here from   clearly shows that the lattice results for @xmath98 may in fact be consistent with experiment .",
    "we presented here an extension of the chiral perturbation theory framework to the energy domain of @xmath13(1232 ) . in this extension",
    "the @xmath13-isobar appears as an explicit degree of freedom in the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the other low - energy degrees of freedom appearing in this lagrangian are pions , nucleons , and @xmath104-mesons .",
    "the power counting depends crucially on how the @xmath13-resonance excitation energy , @xmath105 , compares to the other scales in the problem . in the `` @xmath23-expansion '' scheme adopted here ,",
    "one utilizes the scale hierarchy , @xmath106 .",
    "in other words , we have an eft with two distinct light scales .",
    "such a scale hierarchy is crucial for an adequate counting of the @xmath13-resonance contributions in both the low - energy and the resonance energy regions .",
    "the @xmath23 power counting provides a justification for `` integrating out '' the resonance contribution at very low energies , as well as for resummation of certain resonant contributions in the resonance region .",
    "we applied the @xmath23-expansion to the process of pion electroproduction .",
    "this is a first  study of this reaction in the @xmath107-resonance region .",
    "our resulting next - to - leading order calculation was shown to satisfy the electromagnetic gauge and chiral symmetries , lorentz - covariance , analyticity , unitarity ( watson s theorem ) .",
    "the free parameters entering at this order are the @xmath34 couplings @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 characterizing the @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 transitions , respectively . by comparing our nlo results with the standard multipole solutions ( maid and said ) for the photoproduction multipoles we have extracted @xmath45 = 2.97 and @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath111  % .",
    "the nlo   result was also found to give a good description of the energy - dependence of most non - resonant @xmath112 , @xmath5 and @xmath113-wave photoproduction multipoles in a 100 mev window around the @xmath0-resonance position . from the pion electroproduction cross - section @xmath114",
    "we have extracted @xmath115 , which yields @xmath116  % near @xmath92  gev@xmath56 . in overall ,",
    "the nlo results are consistent with the experimental data of the recent high - precision measurements at mami and bates .",
    "the  framework plays a _ dual role _ in that it allows for an extraction of resonance parameters from observables _ and _ predicts their pion - mass dependence . in this way it may provide a crucial connection of present lattice qcd results ( obtained at larger than physical values of @xmath20 ) to the experiment .",
    "we have shown here that the opening of the @xmath117 decay channel at @xmath118 induces a pronounced non - analytic behavior of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 ratios . while the linearly - extrapolated lattice qcd results for @xmath98 are in disagreement with experimental data , the  prediction of the non - analytic dependencies suggests that these results are in fact consistent with experiment .",
    "the presented results are systematically improvable .",
    "we have indicated what are the next - next - to - leading order effects , however , at present we could only estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our calculations due to such effects .",
    "we have defined and provided a corresponding error band on our nlo results .",
