    "sep is very general in the sense that it includes many mathematical models as : split optimization problems , split fixed point problems , split variational inclusion problems , split variational inequality problems @xcite .",
    "split problems describe finding a solution of a problem whose image under a bounded linear transformation is a solution of another problem .",
    "a special case of sep in practice is the split convex feasibility problem which had been studied and used as a model in intensity - modulated radiation therapy treatment planning , see @xcite .",
    "some algorithms for solving sep can be found , for instance , in @xcite . almost proposed methods for seps based on the proximal method @xcite which consists of solving a regularized equilibrium problem , i.e. , at current iteration , given @xmath15 , the next iterate @xmath16 solves the following problem @xmath17 or @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the resolvent of the bifunction @xmath12 and @xmath20 , see @xcite . in 2012",

    "the advantages of the extragradient method are that it is used for the class of pseudomonotone bifunctions and two optimization programs are solved at each iteration which seems to be numerically easier than the non - linear inequality in the proximal method , see for instance @xcite and the references therein .    in this paper , motivated by the recent works @xcite and the results above , we propose two parallel extragradient - proximal methods for seps for a finite family of bifunctions @xmath35 in @xmath36 and a system of bifunctions @xmath37 in @xmath38 . in the first algorithm",
