    "the large area telescope ( lat ) , on board the _ fermi _  _ gamma - ray space telescope _ , is a pair - conversion @xmath0-ray detector designed to distinguish @xmath0 rays in the energy range 20 mev to more than 300 gev from the intense background of energetic charged particles found in the 565 km altitude orbit of the satellite . for each @xmath0-ray photon event",
    "the lat measures its arrival time , direction , and energy .",
    "the effective collecting area is @xmath1 @xmath2 at 1 gev ( for the pass 7 event class selection ) , the field of view is quite large ( @xmath3 sr ) , and the observing efficiency is very high , limited primarily by interruptions of data taking during passage of fermi through the south atlantic anomaly ( @xmath4 ) and trigger dead time fraction ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the single - photon angular resolution is strongly dependent on energy ; the 68% containment radius is about 0.8@xmath6 at 1 gev ( averaged over the acceptance of the lat ) and varies with energy approximately as e@xmath7 , with an asymptotic value @xmath8 at high energies .",
    "the lat consists of a tracker , a calorimeter , and an anti - coincidence system .",
    "the tracking section of the lat has 36 layers of silicon strip detectors to record the tracks of charged particles , interleaved with 16 layers of tungsten foil ( 12 thin layers , 0.03 radiation length , at the top or `` front '' of the instrument , followed by 4 thick layers , 0.18 radiation length , in the `` back '' section ) to promote @xmath0-ray pair conversion . beneath",
    "the tracker is a calorimeter comprised of an 8-layer array of csi crystals ( 1.08 radiation length per layer ) to determine the @xmath0-ray photon energy .",
    "the tracker is surrounded by a segmented charged - particle anticoincidence detector ( plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes ) to reject cosmic - ray background events .",
    "more information about the lat and its performance is presented in @xcite , and the in - flight calibration of the lat is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+    owing to the nearly continuous all - sky survey observing mode , large field of view , good angular resolution and high sensitivity the lat is an optimal hunter for high - energy flares , transients , and newly appearing @xmath0-ray sources , providing also an unprecedented monitor of variable @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "this all - sky monitor is complemented by the _ fermi _",
    "flare advocate ( a.k.a",
    ". gamma - ray sky watcher , fa - gsw ) service ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , belonging to the lat instrument science operations .",
    "the fa - gsw activity is performed with continuity , day - by day all year , with weekly shifts by members and affiliated scientists of the lat collaboration .",
    "the fa - gsw service was created to supply a quick - look inspection and daily review of the @xmath0-ray sky observed by _",
    "fermi _  lat .",
    "the fa - gsw on shift points out basic facts and information about the high - energy sky of potential interest for the lat science groups , reviewing the all - sky photon count maps collected on short time intervals ( one - day and six - hour count maps ) , reviewing preliminary automated source detections and checking the results of the quick - look science analysis pipeline . for particularly interesting sources a maximum likelihood spectral fit and check of detection significance , flux , spectral photon index , exposure map , localization and multifrequency counterpart associations",
    "is carried out .",
    "a concise daily report is compiled day by day by fa - gsws internally to the lat collaboration .",
    "about 60 shifters belonging to the lat collaboration have served as least one time as fa - gsw .",
    "summaries about significant _ fermi _",
    "lat source detections , new candidate sources and transients , increasing brightness trends and flares from known sources observed in one - day and six - hour time intervals , are published through regular weekly reports in the `` fermi sky blog '' ( figure [ fig : fermiskyblog ] ) , astronomer s telegrams ( atels ) ( figures [ fig : atelsourcessky ] and [ fig : atelstastistics ] ) , and gcns for blazar flares and transients .",
    "figure [ fig : atelsourcessky ] is the all - sky map of the new @xmath0-ray sources , flares and transients found by _",
    "lat and the subject of published atels , in the period between 2008 july 24 , and 2013 january 30 .",
    "the figure shows that most of the flaring sources are blazars as found in the _ fermi _  lat source catalogs @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : atelstastistics ] reports the cumulative distribution and time separation of the 229 atels published on behalf of the _ fermi _  lat collaboration in this period .",
    "results are also communicated to the multiwavelength ( mw ) community using the _ fermi _  mw mailing - list .",
    "the fa - gsw service identifies first seeds for mw coordinated observations and studies .",
    "the lat mw coordinating group page and the fssc mw support page are other resources with information and points of contacts to coordinate and support mw observations involving the _ fermi _  lat .",
    "the fa - gsw service and the mw coordinating group allow the _ fermi _  mission to promote and increase the rate of multifrequency international collaborations and observing campaigns , maximizing the scientific return .",
    "the fa - gsw routine is based on the lat data analysis of level 2 ( l2 ) at the _ fermi _  lat instrument science operation center ( isoc ) of slac , stanford , @xcite .",
    "l2 processing ( instrument monitoring pipeline , background monitoring , quick look science analysis ) is triggered by the first availability of level 1 ( l1 ) processed data and is performed on several time intervals ( 6 hours , 1 day , 1 week ) .",
    "this automated science processing ( asp , figure [ fig : schemeblocks.eps ] ) forms the primary input for the fa - gsws .    the asp analysis pipeline running on the final astrophysical science data ( photon event files ft1 , and spacecraft data files ft2 fits files ) is composed of several scientific tasks @xcite : 1 ) automatic analysis of @xmath0-ray bursts ( impulsive transients ) through refinement of parameters for lat - detected grbs , detection and characterization of grbs not detected onboard , search and analysis of delayed high - energy afterglow emission ; 2 ) flux history monitoring based on a maximum - likelihood method ( ` gtlike ` science tool ) for a predefined list of sources with subsequent addictions of publicly announced sources ( flaring blazars , transient sources announced in atels ) ; 3 ) blind source detection on all - sky photon counts maps accumulated in 6-hour , 1-day , and 1-week intervals , through a fast sky map scan method based on two - dimensional mexican hat wavelet transform , thresholding and sliding cell algorithms @xcite ; 4 ) transient and flare identification based on a variability test ; 5 ) interactive lat source catalogs ; 6 ) multi - mission / multifrequency tools and archives ( e.g. the error circle explorer and spectral energy distribution builder ) linked to asp and provided by the asdc .",
    "the list of discoveries triggered by fa - gsws is substantial .",
    "some examples : 1 ) flares from @xmath0-ray blazars ( extraordinary outbursts of 3c 454.3 , very bright and large flares from other flat spectrum radio quasars like pks 1510 - 089 , 4c 21.35 , ao 0235 + 164 , pks 1502 + 106 , 3c 279 , 3c 273 , pks 1622 - 253 , pks 1424 - 41",
    ". 2 ) intense flares from bl lac objects like mkn 421 , bl lacertae , s5 0716 + 71 .",
    "3 ) short / long duty cycles of other bright @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "4 ) flares from gravitationally lensed @xmath0-ray blazars like pks 1830 - 211 and s3 0218 + 35 .",
    "5 ) flares from radiogalaxies like ngc 1275 or nlsy1 like pmn j0948 + 0022 .",
    "6 ) unidentified transients near the galactic plane ( e.g. j0910 - 5041 , j0109 + 6134 , galactic center region ) .",
    "6 ) flares associated with high confidence with galactic sources ( such as the crab nebula , nova v407 cyg , microquasar cyg x-3 , binary system 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 , and possible flares associated with nova mon 2012 , and nova sco 2012 ) .",
    "7 ) intense @xmath0-ray emission from the quiet and active sun ( m / x class solar flares ) .",
    "the all - sky variability monitor service run by the fa - gsw group represents the liaison between the _ fermi _  lat collaboration and the multifrequency astrophysical and astroparticle communities @xcite .",
    "the role and activity of the fa - gsw shifter can be considered twofold .",
    "1 ) _ gamma - ray flare advocate task _ : flaring sources approaching a daily photon flux of @xmath9 photons ( e@xmath10 100 mev ) @xmath11 s@xmath12 deserve special attention ( detection , localization , flux , photon index to be checked , photon counts maps and exposure maps to be reviewed ) .",
    "internal and public notes , atels , target of opportunity ( too ) are submitted , and mw observing campaigns are organized when needed .",
    "2 ) _ gamma - ray sky watcher task _ : results from the asp pipeline in one - day and six - hour time intervals are checked , searching for transients , flaring sources , peculiar increasing or decreasing brightness trends , and appearance of new candidate @xmath0-ray sources , looking at positional multifrequency associations .    the fa - gsw activity has allowed us to find new @xmath0-ray sources before _",
    "catalog releases , identify sources that appeared variable on short timescales , discover a number of bright @xmath0-ray flares and outbursts emitted by blazars and other agn , recognize transients from galactic sources and low galactic latitude sources not always associated with clear radio / optical / x - ray counterparts , and highlight the emission of the quiet and flaring sun . in",
    "addiction fa - gsws on duty carried out more than 40 toos with the _ swift _ satellite , showing the ideal synergy between the _ fermi _  and _ swift _ missions .",
