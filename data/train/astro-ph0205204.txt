    "spectropolarimetry has proved to be an important tool in the development of unified theories of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "its strength is that it provides an alternative view into the inner regions of the active nucleus , in addition to the direct line - of - sight .",
    "this allows us to probe the structure and kinematics of both the polarizing material and the emission source .",
    "the discovery of polarized broad - line emission from the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) , prompted the suggestion that seyfert types 1 and 2 nuclei are intrinsically the same class of object viewed at different orientations . in the case of seyfert 2s our direct view of the continuum source and broad emission line region ( blr ) is blocked by an optically and geometrically thick torus .",
    "antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) proposed that the optical polarized flux spectrum of ngc1068 can be explained as scattering by free electrons above the poles of the torus .",
    "subsequent modelling ( miller , goodrich & matthews 1991 ; young et al .",
    "1995 ) has confirmed that scattering by free electrons in a conical region along the poles of the torus can successfully explain the observed optical and ultraviolet polarization characteristics of this source .",
    "this basic polar scattering picture seems to be generally valid for seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "since scattered light has an electric vector ( @xmath2 vector ) position angle ( pa ) perpendicular to the scattering plane ( the plane containing the incident and scattered ray ) , the polarized radiation has an @xmath3 vector perpendicular to the scattering cone axis .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that the principal axis of the system is defined by the rotation axis of the accretion disk and that the radio source axis , the torus and the scattering cone are co - aligned with this axis .",
    "scattered light will then be polarized with its @xmath3 vector perpendicular to the axis of the radio source .",
    "observations support this picture : in type 2 seyferts the optical polarization pa is almost always perpendicular to the projected radio source axis ( e.g. , antonucci 1983 ; brindle et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "in contrast , the optical polarization properties of type 1 seyfert galaxies are not consistent with simple polar scattering . according to the seyfert unified scheme type 1 s",
    "are viewed much closer to the system axis than type 2 s .",
    "nevertheless , if only polar scatterers are present , type 1 s should still be polarized perpendicular to the projected radio source axis .",
    "in fact , the optical polarization @xmath2 vector is more often _ aligned _ with this axis ( antonucci 1983 , 1984 , 2001 ; martel 1996 ; m96 ) .",
    "this implies that scattered light emerging from type 1 nuclei follows a different path to that in type 2 s , suggesting , in turn , that the simplest unification model geometry including only a single , polar scattering ` mirror ' , is incomplete .",
    "evidently , we require an additional source of scattered light in seyfert 1s in order to explain the alignment of the polarized light @xmath3 vectors with their radio axes . the location , structure and kinematics of this source are presently unknown .",
    "it is possible that in seyfert 2s this component is hidden from view by the postulated torus or is entirely absent , though the latter case would conflict with the unified theory .",
    "another possibility is that both scattering components are viewed directly but only one dominates the observed polarization in any given object , since the amount of scattered radiation that is polarized is aspect dependent .",
    "the observations presented here are intended to provide a data set with which we can investigate the origin of the optical polarization in type 1 seyfert galaxies .",
    "there have been relatively few spectropolarimetric observations of seyfert 1s in comparison to the extensive studies of seyfert 2s .",
    "the first high signal - to - noise spectropolarimetric observations of type 1 nuclei were carried out by goodrich & miller ( 1994 ; gm94 ) .",
    "these authors studied the polarization of the broad h@xmath1 line and found a diversity of characteristics , including pa rotations across the line profile .",
    "they also pointed out that scattering in an optically thin disk , in the equatorial plane of the system , can produce optical polarization pa s aligned with the radio axis , assuming that the latter is co - axial with the disk .",
    "m96 analysed the optical polarization of 7 seyfert 1s by decomposing the total flux broad h@xmath1 line into several different velocity components and searching for geometrical relationships between the inferred polarizations of these components and morphological and dynamical features of the host galaxy . more recently ,",

    "we have previously presented optical spectropolarimetric observations of mrk509 at 3 epochs , obtained as part of this programme ( young et al .",
    "we show that the polarization of the broad h@xmath1 line is variable on relatively short timescales , indicating that some of the scattering occurs in a compact region .",
    "the variable component also has an @xmath3 vector that is parallel to the small scale radio axis , consistent with an origin in a compact scattering region in the equatorial plane of the system .",
    "further modelling , young ( 2000 ) , shows that altering the flux incident upon the scattering regions can produce the time variable polarization observed .",
    "in this paper we present spectropolarimetric observations of 36 type 1 seyfert nuclei , obtained at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the anglo  australian telescope ( aat ) between 1996 and 1999 . in section  [ obs ] the observations and data reduction procedures",

    "+    [ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : rotsig ]    few of these objects exhibit _ all _ of the expected polarization characteristics . however , the pa rotation and percentage polarization structure result from different mechanisms ( an anisotropy in scattering angle distribution and differential dilution , respectively ) and , although both effects depend on the line - emitting disk being inclined to the line - of - sight , they are also subject to other , independent , parameters . therefore , these characteristics would not necessarily be strongly correlated .",
    "mrk6 provides the best overall match to the qualitative predictions .",
    "the most problematic objects are akn120 , whose percentage polarization spectrum exhibits very different structures at different epochs , and mrk304 , in which the h@xmath1 polarization structure agrees quite well with that predicted , whereas the polarization pa is nearly orthogonal to the reported radio axis , consistent with polar rather than equatorial scattering .",
    "a blue - to - red pa rotation is seen in only 6 out of the 10 objects . however , increasing the scattering ring radius relative to that of the disk will decrease the angle subtended by the disk at a given scattering element and hence reduce the pa swing .",
    "therefore , the absence of a significant pa rotation in some objects may simply mean that the scattering ring has a relatively large radius in those cases .",
    "when a pa swing _ is _ seen , we would expect the continuum polarization pa to bisect the blue - to - red rotation across the line .",
    "the continuum pa lies within the range covered by the h@xmath1 polarization pa in 5 out of the 6 objects that exhibit a pa swing across the line , but only in two ( mrk876 and mrk985 ) is it approximately centred with respect to the blue and red wing pa s .    in only two galaxies , mrk6 and mrk509 ,",
    "do the observed variations in the degree of polarization across h@xmath1 closely match the model prediction in that the central dip in polarization is flanked by red and blue peaks of similar amplitude .",
    "in general , the prominence of the blue- and red - wing polarization peaks varies considerably , as does their relative amplitude .",
    "these features are absent in 3 objects ( izw1 , mrk876 , mrk985 ; which , however , do exhibit pa rotations ) while , in the others , the blue - wing peak is usually the stronger .",
    "mrk 304 , whilst showing a peak - trough - peak variation in @xmath11 over broad h@xmath1 , has an optical polarization pa orthogonal to that of the reported radio axis pa  apparently consistent with polar rather than equatorial scattering .",
    "nevertheless , it may still be possible to reconcile the polarization characteristics of mrk 304 with equatorial scattering .",
    "corbett et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that scattering from the inner , far wall of the circum - nuclear torus can produce scattered light whose polarization pa is perpendicular to the radio axis if an object is inclined such that the observer has a clear view of the emission disk and the far inner wall of the torus , but the scattering material at the nearer inner wall and sides of the torus is obscured by the bulk of the torus material .",
    "a similar configuration may explain the optical polarization of mrk 304 in the context of the equatorial scattering model developed in this work .",
    "for example , the torus may partially obscure the equatorial scattering region such that most of the scattering material located at the sides and along the nearer segment ( i.e. , opposite point b in fig .  [ fig : eqscat ] ) of the scattering ring is obscured , while the emission source and the far side of the scattering ring remain visible .",
    "the scattered profile would be broader than in the direct view , so a peak - trough - peak variation in @xmath11 would be seen across the emission - line .",
    "in addition , the scattered flux from along the far side of the equatorial scattering ring ( i.e. , opposite point a in fig .  [ fig : eqscat ] ) will have an average pa that is perpendicular to the emission disk axis and hence radio axis .",
    "a similar explanation may apply to akn 564 and ngc 5548 , however , the lack of polarization peaks in the line wings remains a problem for these objects .",
    "clearly , the polarization features predicted by the equatorial scattering model are present to very differing degrees in different objects .",
    "this is , perhaps , not surprising given the simple geometry of the model and the likely complexity of the emission and scattering regions in reality .",
    "for example , the fact that the broad h@xmath1 lines commonly have asymmetric profiles shows that the emission region is more complex than the simple disk envisaged in the model .",
    "additional emission components or scattering centres , perhaps with velocity shifts , will undoubtedly distort the polarization signature of the disk / ring system .",
    "for example , a scattering outflow along the system axis would produce red - shifted scattered light , polarized orthogonal to the equatorial component .",
    "we might thus expect the amplitude of the red - wing polarization peak to be reduced ( by cancellation ) relative to that of the blue - wing and its pa of polarization to be preferentially modified , breaking the symmetry of the blue- and red - wing polarization pa s relative to that of the continuum .",
    "such an outflow might be identified with the polar scattering region which , as we discuss below , must also be present in seyfert 1 galaxies .      while the equatorial scattering model can account for the most striking features that are present in our data , namely the blue - to - red polarization pa rotation and the peak - trough - peak variation in degree of polarization over the broad h@xmath1 line ,",
    "there is also considerable evidence that polar scattering is important in seyfert 1 nuclei .",
    "in particular , 3 objects have polarization pa s perpendicular to the radio source axis and 3 more exhibit polarization spectra very similar to those observed in ` polarized broad - line ' seyfert 2 nuclei . the latter objects , along with others previously described ( gm94 ) , represent direct observational evidence that the ` scattering mirror ' , which is located above the circum - nuclear torus and allows us to detect the obscured blr in seyfert 2 galaxies , is also present in type 1 nuclei .",
    "this is , of course , also implied by the seyfert unification scheme , according to which , similar scattering regions should be present in all seyfert nuclei .",
    "consideration of the optical polarization properties of seyfert 1 nuclei should , therefore , include far - field polar scattering as well as the near - field equatorial component .",
    "our detailed model of mrk509 ( young 2000 ) includes both of these components and also takes into account several other effects , such as scattering off the inner wall of the torus . here , for simplicity",
    ", we discuss only the combination of near - field equatorial scattering , as described in section  [ eqscat ] , and polar scattering .",
    "we envisage the polar scattering region as a cone , containing dust or free electrons , which is co - axial with the torus and has a comparable opening angle .",
    "the observed polarization produced by the combination of equatorial and polar scattering will , in general , depend on the inclination of the system axis to the line - of - sight . at very small inclinations ( with the system axis closely aligned with the line - of - sight ) , we expect a low degree of polarization , since the circular symmetry ensures that both components of scattered light will suffer almost complete cancellation .",
    "as the inclination is increased from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , the degree of polarization increases monotonically for both components .",
    "calculations using young s ( 2000 ) scattering code show that , for the wide scattering cone envisaged , @xmath11 increases more rapidly with inclination for the equatorial than for the polar component . without the optically thick torus , therefore , the equatorial component would dominate the observed polarization at all inclinations .",
    "however , for inclinations @xmath14 , the line - of - sight to the blr and the equatorial scattering region is blocked by the torus .",
    "we would then observe a seyfert 2 nucleus , with broad balmer lines visible in polarized light as a result of scattering in the polar region . in order for polar scattering to make a sigificant contribution to the polarization in _ type 1 _ seyferts , the equatorial component must be suppressed relative to the polar component .",
    "an obvious possibility is that , in the objects that exhibit signatures of polar scattering , the direct line - of - sight to the agn passes through the ( presumably relatively tenuous ) upper layers of the torus .",
    "light from the the equatorial scattering region might easily suffer sufficient extinction to allows polar scattering to dominate the observed polarization .",
    "direct light from the agn would , of course , also suffer extinction and as we have already noted in section  [ polstr ] , this would help to explain the polarization wavelength dependence in objects that have ` seyfert 2-like ' polarization properties ( fairall51 , ngc4593 and , to a lesser extent , was45 ) .",
    "the above analysis suggests that the wide range in polarization properties displayed by the sample as a whole can be at least partly understood in terms of an orientation sequence .",
    "some of the objects that are evidently dominated by interstellar polarization have low measured polarizations ( @xmath15 per cent ) and must , therefore , be intrinsically weakly polarized . in our scheme",
    ", these objects ( e.g. , mrk926 , pg1211 + 143 ) would have near pole - on orientations .",
    "the objects listed in table  [ tab : rotsig ] , which exhibit h@xmath1 polarization features characteristic of equatorial scattering , have intermediate inclinations to the line - of - sight .",
    "objects that show evidence of polar scattering ( polarization pa perpendicular to radio axis , or seyfert 2-like percentage polarization spectra ) are viewed at larger inclination angles , comparable to the torus opening angle , and suffer a moderate amount of extinction in the upper layers of the torus . with a further increase in inclination ,",
    "the line - of - sight to the nucleus passes through the main body of the dusty molecular torus and a ` polarized broad - line ' seyfert 2 galaxy is observed .",
    "it is worth briefly considering nls1 s in relation to the scheme outlined above .",
    "if the small widths of their balmer lines are due to the line - emitting disk having a face - on orientation , the combined scattering model implies that they should be weakly polarized .",
    "in fact , in our sample , only two ( pg1211 + 143 and mkn896 ) have measured polarizations @xmath16 per cent . of the others , 3",
    "are probably dominated by interstellar polarization ( at levels @xmath17 per cent ) and the remaining 3 are intrinsically polarized at similar levels to those of the ` normal ' seyfert 1s .",
    "one of the latter , akn564 , is polarized perpendicular to the radio axis , indicating that polar scattering is important and hence that the object is viewed at a fairly large inclination .",
    "the nls1 s , therefore , appear to be distributed amongst all three of the postulated orientation classes , rather than being confined to the pole - on group .    while the combination of equatorial and polar scattering outlined above can broadly explain the range of h@xmath1 polarization properties found in the sample , there are a number of intrinsically polarized objects whose status within this scheme is unclear .",
    "most of these show a dip in polarization over the broad h@xmath1 line core but there is little evidence for any of the other features associated with the emission disk / scattering ring model .",
    "better data might , perhaps , reveal such features in some cases ( e.g. , ms1849.2@xmath187832 , mrk279 and mrk290 ) but in other objects ( e.g. , ngc5548 and mrk335 ) , there are large variations in the degree and pa of polarization over h@xmath1 line profile that are difficult to understand in terms of the simple scenario presented here .",
    "we have detected polarization intrinsic to the active nucleus in 20 out of 36 seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we have measured a significant level of polarization in a further 7 objects but in these we can not exclude the possibility of serious contamination by line - of - sight interstellar polarization .",
    "overall , the sample exhibits a wide diversity in polarization properties .",
    "the main characteristics of the intrinsically polarized objects may be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   large variations in both the degree and pa of polarization with line - of - sight velocity across the broad h@xmath1 emission line are common .",
    "15 objects exhibit a change in polarization pa over the broad h@xmath1 line with approximately half of these showing pa rotations from blue - to - red within the h@xmath1 profile .",
    "the broad h@xmath1 line is usually depolarized relative to the adjacent continuum but in many cases the dip in polarization is associated mainly with the core of the line profile and is often flanked by polarization peaks in the red and blue wings , the blue wing peak usually being the most prominent .",
    "4 .   in 4 objects",
    "there is an increase in percentage polarization over the broad h@xmath1 line relative to the adjacent continuum , and in the two for which we have sufficient wavelength coverage , the continuum polarization rises to the blue .",
    "5 .   in general",
    ", there appears to be no simple relationship between the velocity dependences of the polarization pa and the degree of polarization across the h@xmath1 profile , in the sense that the presence of a blue - to - red pa rotation does not uniquely correspond to any particular type of percentage polarization structure .",
    "several objects were observed at two or more epochs and in 3 of these ( mrk509 , akn120 and ngc7469 ) there is convincing evidence that the polarization of the broad h@xmath1 line varies over a timescale of @xmath19 year . 7 .   of the 10 objects for which radio pa s are available , the average position angles of polarization are approximately parallel to the radio axis in 6 objects and approximately perpendicular in the remaining 3 .",
    "8 .   in a number of the ` parallel ' objects ,",
    "the blue - to - red rotation in polarization pa across the h@xmath1 profile crosses the radio source pa . in some extreme cases ( akn120 and kuv18217 + 6419 ) the polarization * e * vector changes alignment across the profile from parallel to perpendicular to the radio axis .",
    "we argue that much of the observed diversity in polarization properties , including the main features of the distinctive polarization structures associated with the h@xmath1 line , can be explained by a model in which the broad balmer line emission comes from a rotating disk and is scattered by two separate scattering regions producing orthogonally polarized light .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "a near - field scattering ring co - planar with the line - emitting disk and situated within the torus , in its equatorial plane ; 2 .   a far - field scattering cone situated outside the torus but aligned with the torus / disk axis .",
    "the relative importance of these two scattering regions as sources of polarized light is governed primarily by the inclination of the system axis to the line - of - sight .",
    "the polarization properties of type 1 seyfert nuclei can be broadly classified in an orientation sequence .",
    "thus ,    1 .   weakly polarized objects are near pole - on systems ; 2 .",
    "objects polarized parallel to the radio axis and exhibiting signatures of equatorial scattering in h@xmath1 polarization ( i.e. , a peak - trough - peak variation in percentage polarization and/or a blue - to - red pa rotation across the line profile ) , are viewed at intermediate orientations and are dominated by equatorial scattering ; 3 .   objects polarized perpendicular to the radio axis and exhibiting an increase in polarization to short wavelengths , with local peaks associated with the broad emission - lines , are viewed at grazing incidence to the circum - nuclear torus and are dominated by polar scattering .    the latter category , of which we have identified 3 possible members amongst our sample , with a further example from the literature , have polarization properties that are essentially identical to those of seyfert 2 galaxies in which polarized broad - lines have been detected . as in type 2 s , the presence of an underlying , unpolarized continuum is required to explain both the continuum polarization wavelength dependence and the increases in degree of polarization over the broad - lines .",
    "the equatorial component of scattered light must also be suppressed for polar scattering to dominate the observed polarization .",
    "both conditions can be satisfied if the direct line - of - sight to the blr and equatorial scattering region passes through the upper layers of the torus , so that the nuclei of these objects suffer a higher degree of extinction than other seyfert 1s .",
    "this group represents direct observational evidence that a seyfert 2-like polar scattering region ( the ` mirror ' that allows us to detect the hidden blr in some objects ) is also present in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "type 2 seyfert galaxies can , themselves , be straightforwardly incorporated into this scheme , since at yet larger inclinations , the direct line - of - sight to both the blr and the equatorial scattering region is blocked by the torus and a seyfert 2 nucleus with polarized ( polar - scattered ) broad - lines will be observed .",
    "the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample display a range of polarization properties that is not strikingly different from that of the sample as a whole .",
    "there is no compelling evidence that they are viewed from a preferred orientation , or that their broad - line regions are partially obscured .",
    "the model we have outlined , while providing an explanation for the key features of our data , can not in its basic form account for the entire range of polarization behaviour exhibited by individual objects .",
    "there are many possible effects that may modify the h@xmath1 polarization from that predicted by the model .",
    "nevertheless , it serves as a useful framework for a general understanding of the polarization properties of seyfert 1 galaxies and provides an insight into the relationship between the scattering geometries of type 1 and 2 seyfert nuclei .",
