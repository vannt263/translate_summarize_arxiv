    "in large - scale cellular networks , the existence of interference at a receiver is an inevitable outcome of the concurrent operation of multiple transmitters at the same carrier frequency and time slot .",
    "it is a fundamental notion of wireless communications and thus methods to reduce it @xcite and even exploit it @xcite are of great interest .",
    "conventionally , multiuser interference is restricted with the use of orthogonal channels which prevent intra - cell interference , i.e. a user ( base station ( bs ) ) experiences interference only from out - of - cell bss ( users ) . however , even though orthogonality assists in the reduction of multiuser interference , it limits the available spectrum .",
    "given the increased use of wireless devices , especially mobile phones , the orthogonality schemes will be quite restrictive in the near future . towards this direction ,",
    "full - duplex ( fd ) is considered as a possible technology for the next generation of cellular networks .",
    "fd radio refers to the simultaneous operation of both transmission and reception using non - orthogonal channels and hence its implementation could potentially double the spectral efficiency .",
    "nevertheless , the use of non - orthogonal channels has the critical disadvantage of increasing the interference in a cellular network , which significantly degrades its performance @xcite .",
    "firstly , the existence of more active wireless links results in the escalation of both intra- and out - of - cell multiuser interference .",
    "secondly , the non - orthogonal operation at a transceiver creates a loop interference ( li ) between the input and output antennas .",
    "this aggregate interference at a receiver is the reason why fd has been previously regarded as an unrealistic approach in wireless communications .",
    "indeed , the primary concern towards making fd feasible was how to mitigate the li which has an major negative impact on the receiver s performance .",
    "recently , many methods have been developed which successfully mitigate the li ; these methods can be active ( channel - aware ) , e.g. , @xcite , passive ( channel - unaware ) , e.g. , @xcite , or a combination of the two , e.g. , @xcite . with regards to the multiuser interference , a well - known approach for reducing it",
    "is the employment of directional antennas . by focusing the signal towards the receiver s direction ,",
    "the antenna can increase the received power and at the same time decrease the interference it generates towards other directions .",
    "the significance of directional antennas in large - scale networks has been shown before . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied an ad - hoc network s performance under some spatial diversity methods and showed the achieved gains .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the impact on the performance of a downlink user in a heterogeneous cellular network with directional antennas was demonstrated .",
    "the employment of directional antennas in an fd context , provides the prospect of passively suppressing the li with antenna separation techniques @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "fd cellular networks with omnidirectional antennas are investigated where the terminals only make use of active cancellation mechanisms .    in this paper",
    ", we consider fd cellular networks where the terminals employ directional antennas and therefore , in addition to the active cancellation , they can passively suppress the li and also reduce the multiuser interference .",
    "the main contribution of this work is the modeling of the passive suppression as a function of the angle between the transmit and receive antennas . by deriving analytical expressions of the outage probability and the average sum rate of the network ,",
    "we show the significant gains that can be achieved .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] presents the network model together with the channel , interference and directional antenna model .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] provides the main results of the paper and in section [ sec : validation ] the numerical results are presented which validate our analysis .",

    "fd networks can be categorized into two - node and three - node architectures @xcite .",
    "the former , referred also as bidirectional , describes the case where both nodes , i.e. , the user and the base station ( bs ) , have fd - capabilities .",
    "the latter , also known as relay or bs architecture , describes the case where only the bs ( or in other scenarios the relay ) has fd - capabilities . in what follows , we consider both architectures in the case where each node employs a number of directional antennas .",
    "the network is studied from a large - scale point of view using stochastic geometry @xcite .",

    "a user selects to connect to the nearest bs in the plane , that is , bs @xmath21 serves user @xmath22 if and only if @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . assuming the user is located at the origin @xmath26 and at a distance @xmath3 to the nearest bs , the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath3 is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "note that this distribution is also valid for the nearest distance between two users and between two bss .",
    "all channels in the network are assumed to be subject to both small - scale fading and large - scale path loss .",
    "specifically , the fading between two nodes is rayleigh distributed and so the power of the channel fading is an exponential random variable with mean @xmath28 .",
    "the channel fadings are considered to be independent between them .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we will denote by @xmath33 the path loss exponent for the channels between bss and between users .",

    "define as @xmath35 and @xmath36 the number of directional transmit / receive antennas employed at a bs and a user respectively .",
    "the main and side lobes of each antenna are approximated by a circular sector as in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the beamwidth of the main lobe is @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "it is assumed that an active link between a user and a bs lies in the boresight direction of the antennas of both nodes , i.e. , maximum power gain can be achieved .",
    "note that @xmath39 refers to the omni - directional case @xcite . as in @xcite , we assume that the antenna gain of the main lobe is @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath38 is the ratio of the side lobe level to the main lobe level . therefore , the antenna gain of the side lobe is @xmath42 , @xmath38 .",
    "the total multiuser interference at a node is the aggregate sum of the interfering received signals from the bss of @xmath18 and the uplink users of @xmath43 . in the two - node architecture , multiuser interference at any node results from both out - of - cell users and bss . in the three - node architecture ,",
    "the bs experiences multiuser interference from out - of - cell bss and users , whereas the downlink user experiences additional intra - cell interference from the uplink user .",
    "when @xmath44 or @xmath45 the transmitters can interfere with a receiver in four different ways @xcite :    * transmitting towards a receiver in the main sector , * transmitting away from a receiver in the main sector , * transmitting towards a receiver outside the main sector , * transmitting away from a receiver outside the main sector ,    where the main sector is the area covered by the main lobe of the receiver .    consider the interference received at a node @xmath46 from all other network nodes @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . to evaluate the interference ,",

    "firstly , we illustrate in figure [ fig : outage_vs_bpcu ] the impact on the uplink outage probability from the employment of directional antennas .",
    "both architectures benefit greatly from directionality but the three - node achieves a better performance due to the bs s ability to passively suppress the li .",

    "finally , figure [ fig : rate_vs_li ] shows the average sum rate of each architecture with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "the sum rate of the three - node architecture is obviously greater than the sum rate of the two - node architecture .",
    "this is in part due to the li passive suppression at the uplink but also due to the half - duplex mode at the downlink which is not affected by li .",
    "when @xmath154 , the sum rate of the three - node converges to the rate of the downlink whereas the sum rate of the two - node converges to zero . on the other hand , when @xmath150 , the two - node outperforms the three - node as expected since both nodes operate fd mode but this scenario is difficult to achieve which is also evident from the figure",
    "this paper has presented the impact of directional antennas on the performance of fd cellular networks .",
    "the ability of the three - node architecture to passively suppress the li at the uplink has significant gains to its efficiency .",
    "moreover , since the downlink user operates in half - duplex mode , the network can achieve high sum rates .",
    "the three - node architecture is regarded as the topology to be potentially implemented first in the case of fd employment in cellular networks .",
