    "after the seminal work of witten @xcite , chern - simons ( @xmath4 ) theory has been deeply studied both in mathematics and physics .",
    "a most attractive property of this topological field theory is its large @xmath1 duality with the @xmath7-model topological string as discovered by gopakumar and vafa in @xcite . from the physics viewpoint , this is a concrete realization of t hooft s intuition @xcite that the large @xmath1 feynman expansion of a gauge theory with @xmath8 structure group can be recast as a perturbative expansion of closed oriented strings in a suitable background ; mathematically , such duality is a precise ( and amazing ! ) correspondence between two seemingly very unrelated mathematical objects , namely knot invariants and ( relative ) gromov - witten invariants .",
    "this duality is realised through a particular kind of _ geometric transition _ , called _ conifold transition _ , which plays a relevant rle in the study of the moduli space of calabi - yau three - folds ( @xmath9 ) ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "let us recall the basic features of gopakumar - vafa ( @xmath10 ) duality .",
    "we have the following    let @xmath11 be a closed smooth 3-manifold such that @xmath12 is a calabi - yau threefold . then the open topological @xmath7-model on @xmath12 , with @xmath1 lagrangian branes wrapping @xmath11 , is equivalent to @xmath8 chern - simons theory on @xmath11 .",
    "[ wittencs ]    the topological open @xmath7-model on @xmath13 with @xmath1 @xmath7-branes wrapping the base @xmath14 is equivalent at large @xmath1 to the closed topological @xmath7-model on @xmath15 .",
    "[ gv ]    the closed string target space @xmath15 and the open string one @xmath13 are related by topological surgery - a birational contraction plus a complex deformation of a nodal singularity .",
    "this is what goes under the name of `` _ ( conifold ) geometric transition _ '' .",
    "as it stands , the content of proposition [ gv ] is striking and somewhat mysterious : a topological invariant of a 3-manifold - the @xmath4 partition function , or reshetikin - turaev - witten invariant of @xmath14 - is also a generating function of symplectic invariants of a non - compact khler manifold - its gromov - witten potential",
    ". it would be then extremely interesting to see if one could find new examples of such a duality along the same lines , replacing @xmath14 with a generic 3-manifold and engineering the geometric transition in such a case .",
    "indeed , one expects on general grounds the duality to hold for chern - simons theories on rational homology spheres , but actually very few examples beyond @xmath14 are known : + * open problem . *",
    "_ find when the reshetikin - turaev - witten invariant of a compact smooth 3-manifold @xmath11 is equal , in suitable coordinates , to the all genus gromov - witten potential of an algebraic threefold @xmath16 obtained by geometric transition from @xmath12 : that is , @xmath16 is given by a complex deformation of @xmath12 to a normal variety , followed by a birational resolution . _",
    "+ this issue has been addressed in the case of @xmath17 cyclic quotients of @xmath14 :    let @xmath18 . the hori - vafa mirror curve and differential of the family of @xmath9 obtained by geometric transition from @xmath12 coincide with the spectral curve and resolvent of the @xmath19 chern - simons matrix model @xcite .",
    "[ hyo ]    this has been achieved through a detailed study of the random matrix representation for the chern - simons path integral , originally obtained by mario in @xcite .",
    "an early confirmation of the above assertion was provided in @xcite for @xmath20 , by matching the t hooft expansion of the chern - simons 2-matrix model with the solutions of the picard - fuchs system at the orbifold point of @xmath21 .",
    "notice that , assuming ; see also @xcite for rigorous mathematical proofs . ]",
    "the validity of local mirror symmetry for toric @xmath9 , proposition [ hyo ] implies @xmath10 duality for @xmath22 lens spaces at least in genus zero ; actually , recent progress @xcite strongly suggests that the spectral data contain the full structure of the @xmath23-model on toric @xmath9 at all genera , in which case the work @xcite would become automatically an all - genus proof .",
    "+ however , it has been suspected that one could hardly go further along this direction for generic @xmath11 .",
    "actually the most exhaustive and detailed monograph on the subject contains the following + * claim 1 ( @xcite ) . *",
    "_ proposition [ hyo ] is false when @xmath18 is replaced by the generic lens space @xmath24 for @xmath6 . _",
    "+ in this note we will perform a detailed analysis of the whole family @xmath24 , thus including cyclic subgroups not contained in @xmath2 , along the lines of @xcite and assuming mirror symmetry .",
    "the case @xmath6 , in which the lens space is not a @xmath25 bundle on @xmath26 , appears to be much harder as most of the features of the @xmath27 case , like the mirror realization of @xcite become either unclear or simply are not there . to this aim , in section [ closed ] we will work out explicitly the conifold transition for the case at hand and obtain a class of would - be large @xmath1 duals @xmath28 as well as their hori - vafa mirror curves , correcting _ en passant",
    "_ a few claims in the literature about the impossibility of performing such a geometric transition in the @xmath0 case preserving at the same time the @xmath29 condition ; in section [ open ] we will present a matrix integral representation for the chern - simons @xmath8 partition function on @xmath0 in a fixed flat connection background and consider its large @xmath1 expansion as governed by a spectral curve and a resolvent",
    ". we will find disagreement for @xmath6 with the @xmath23-model spectral data obtained after geometric transition from @xmath5 ; under the assumption of validity of local mirror symmetry for toric @xmath9 , this proves the claim above .",
    "+ even though our proof of claim 1 might appear to be an obstruction to the program of extending the duality of @xcite to more general backgrounds , let us outline two possible avenues of further investigation which we think might lead to the solution of the puzzle for the case under scrutiny .",
    "+ one possible way out is to regard @xmath10 duality as an identity between the full @xmath4 partition on a 3-manifold @xmath11 and some suitable _ non - perturbative _ definition of the @xmath30model on the @xmath9 obtained through conifold geometric transition from @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , as first advocated in chern - simons matrix model representation . ]",
    "@xcite , a proper non - perturbative definition of the @xmath30model on toric target spaces with a dual matrix integral description should be given in terms of a filling fraction independent sum over multi - instanton sectors .",
    "this would be dual to the proper definition of the reshetikin - turaev - witten invariant as a sum over flat connections .",
    "+ a second possibility , hinted at by the geometric picture arising in the discussion of section 2 , might consist in a refinement of the notion of `` orbifold of the @xmath10 duality for @xmath14 '' in order to properly encompass the case of the generic lens space . indeed ,",
    "for @xmath31 the cyclic group does no longer act fiberwise on the resolved conifold , giving rise to an orbibundle over a rational curve with marked points ( see remark [ orbicurve ] ) . this new feature with respect to",
    "the @xmath27 case definitely begs for further understanding , in order to clarify the correct formulation of @xmath10 duality in this case as well as its possible relation with a ( suitably twisted ) gromov - witten theory of orbicurves .",
    "+ we hope to address both this issues in future work .",
    "according to proposition [ wittencs ] and [ gv ] , the @xmath10 duality for the case of the generic @xmath0 lens space should be realized in two steps :    1 .   a complex deformation of @xmath32 to a normal variety @xmath33 ( a suitable @xmath34 quotient of the singular conifold ) ; 2 .   a complete crepant resolution @xmath35 of the latter .",
    "the first step is realized as follows : let us recall that , from ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.6 ) , the cotangent bundle to the 3-sphere @xmath13 is diffeomorphic to a smooth hypersurface in @xmath36 [ conifoldeq ] xy -zt = which is a complex structure deformation of a conifold singularity .",
