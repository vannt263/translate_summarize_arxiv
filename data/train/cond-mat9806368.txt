    "since the pioneering work of anderson on localization@xcite , it was realized by mott and twose@xcite , that all states in an infinite 1- dimensional chain are localized at arbitrary disorder strength , at zero temperature . they could show that solutions of the corresponding schroedinger equation at points at a distance @xmath4 are with a probability @xmath5 in resonance , where @xmath6 is the mean free path .",
    "thus , its exponential decrease gives a localization length of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "later on thouless argued that this statement can be extended to a thin disordered wire , and he found that the localization length is given by @xmath8 where @xmath7 is the elastic mean free path , and @xmath9 the number of transverse channels , with the fermi wave vector @xmath10 , and the cross section of the wire , @xmath11@xcite .",
    "this was proven rigourously for a matrix of @xmath12 chains , when @xmath12 is small , by anderson et al .",
    ", weller et al . , and then by dorokhov by solution of a fokker- planck equation@xcite , calculating the transmission probability through the wire . in the limit of a thin wire ,",
    "where the motion of the electrons is diffusive in all directions on small length scales , the proof of complete localization at zero temperature was given by efetov and larkin with a field theoretical method , obtaining an exponential decrease of the density - density correlation function in space , in the zero frequency limit .",
    "they discovered in addition that the localization length depends on the global symmetry of the wire@xcite .",
    "the localization length was found to be given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 for orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic symmetry , which corresponds to no magnetic field , weak magnetic field , and strong spin- orbit interaction , respectively .",
    "the density autocorrelation function was recently studied for the total spectrum as a function of the length of the mesoscopic wire by altland and fuchs @xcite . because of the complexity of the problem , they did not obtain a closed analytical expression for arbitrary frequency , but succeeded to do a numerical analysis in the unitary regime .",
    "new information on the level statistics of the wire as a function of its length was found in the metal - insulator - crossover regime .    in this article",
    "we argue that in order to study the level statistics , it is enough to calculate the simpler asd .",
    "this function contains information on the spectrum , but its complexity is reduced so that it can be calculated analytically more easily .",
    "we will show that it provides a usefull tool to study localization , and could be used in situations which have been unaccessible to other analytical methods .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the first part",
    "the characterization of level statistics by an autocorrelation function is reviewed , and the asd is defined . in the second part",
    "the result for the disorder averaged asd for a quasi-1-dimensional wire in a weak magnetic field is presented and discussed for various regimes in the frequency - length plane .",
    "information on the metal - insulator - crossover is obtained .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results and the potential of the asd as a new tool to study anderson localization .",
    "the crossover from a metal to an insulator in a finite coherent , disordered metal particle is accompanied by a change in the statistics of the discrete energy levels@xcite .",
    "this can be studied by calculating a disorder averaged autocorrelation function between two energies at a distance @xmath15 in the energy level spectrum .",
    "then , considering a quasi-1-dim .",
    "disordered metal wire with crossection @xmath11 , a map as a function of its length @xmath16 and the energy @xmath15 can be drawn as in fig . 1 . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the total mean level spacing with the average density of states @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the number @xmath20 of electrons per volume @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the fermi energy , and @xmath23 the electron mass .",
    "@xmath24 is the local mean level spacing , when the length of the wire , @xmath16 , exceeds its localization length @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the thouless energy @xmath25 is defined through the diffusion time across the length l , @xmath26 when the diffusion is free , as obtained from the classical diffusion equation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron density .",
    "the classical diffusion constant d in 3 dimensions is related to the elastic mean free time @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the energy which limits the universal ( ergodic ) regime of nonintegrable ballistic quantum billiards @xcite , @xcite . since @xmath31 depends on the exact boundary conditions , it may change as a function of l in a continous , but nonmonotonous way as indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "this map has been explored by considering the autocorrelation function of density of states , see @xcite and references therein .    here , we will restrict us to the asd , as defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 is the hamiltonian of the considered system , and @xmath35 a central energy .",
    "it contains only information about the spectrum , not on the wave functions of the mesoscopic system .",
    "this function was recently obtained for the wigner- dyson random matrices ( gue@xcite , goe@xcite , cue , coe@xcite and crossover@xcite ) and successfully used to characterize the spectrum of nonintegrable quantum systems , like a sinai billiard@xcite , for energies @xmath36 , where the average over the energy @xmath35 had to be done in order to obtain a universal function .    in the following ,",
    "it is obtained for free electrons in a random potential in a finite system , which can be used for the study of a disordered mesoscopic metal of which at least one dimension exceeds the mean free path l. the asd can be calculated analytically and shown to agree with the one for wigner - dyson random matrices , when the dimensions of the system do not exceed a localization length @xmath1 .",
    "this is expected , since a disordered metal particle is an example of a nonintegrable physical system , and should therefore have the same energy level statistics as f.e . the sinai billiard , for frequencies not exceeding the thouless energy , the ergodic regime , where a particle has time enough to cover the whole sample uniformly@xcite .    here , we will derive the asd for the more general case , when one dimension may exceed the localization length @xmath1 , a quasi-1-dim .",
    "conductor , of length @xmath16 and crossection @xmath11 where the number of transverse channels is much larger than 1 , @xmath37 , in order to find out if this relatively simple function does contain information about the metal - insulator crossover .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electron charge , c the velocity of light , and @xmath40 the vector potential due to an external magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is a gaussian distributed random function @xmath43 which models randomly distributed , uncorrelated impurities in the wire .",
    "the asd can be calulated for such a hamiltonian as a function of the length of the wire @xmath44 and energy difference @xmath15 .",
    "the unitary limit is considered , where the magnetic flux through the wire , @xmath45 , exceeds @xmath46 .",
    "the asd can be written in terms of grassmannian functional integrals .",
    "this allows to perform the impurity averaging as a gaussian integral .",
    "the resulting interacting theory of grassman fields can be decoupled by a transformation , introducing a functional integral over a @xmath47-matrix q. next , the grassmann fields can be integrated out .",
    "the integral over q can be simplified for @xmath48 to an integral over gapless fluctuations around the saddle point which have the action of an o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model @xmath49 = \\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\int \\frac{d x}{s l } [ g tr ( \\frac{\\nabla}{\\pi / l } q ) ^2 + i \\frac{\\omega}{\\delta } tr \\lambda q ] , \\ ] ] with the nonlinear constraint @xmath50 . here ,",
    "@xmath51 which has the physical meaning of the dimensionless conductance @xmath52 of the wire , as long as the einstein relation to the diffusion constant @xmath53 holds , @xmath54 .",
    "the derivation is given in .",
    "a nonlinear sigma model for disordered electron systems had been first derived in @xcite for n replicas using a functional integral over conventional numbers , in @xcite for grassmann variables , and then for superfields @xcite .    choosing a representation of the matrix @xmath55",
    ", the integrals can be performed by means of the transfer matrix method .",
    "thus , the problem can be reduced to the solution of the equation@xcite , @xmath56 p_z ( \\lambda ) , \\ ] ] with the boundary condition @xmath57 . here ,",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the hamilton operator is , @xmath60 = - i \\pi g \\frac { \\omega}{\\delta } \\lambda + \\frac{\\pi}{2 }    \\partial_{\\lambda } ( 1 - \\lambda^2 ) \\partial_{\\lambda}.\\ ] ]    the asd is then given by @xmath61 while we did not succeed to find an exact analytical solution of this initial value problem , the function @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\exp [ \\frac{\\pi}{2 } ( \\frac{\\omega } { \\delta } ) ^2 g^2 \\int_{1/g}^{x/(l g ) } d s   ( \\exp ( \\pi ( s - 1/g ) ) -1 ) ^2 ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a good approximation when @xmath63 , for arbitrary @xmath64 , and becomes exact for @xmath65 when @xmath66 .    thus , the asd is obtained as @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69    fig .",
    "2 shows a plot of the asd as a function of the scaled frequency @xmath4 and the scaled length @xmath70 .",
    "a clear damping of the amplitude of oscillations accompanied by a shift of their phase is seen .",
    "this shows that there is an effect of localization on level correlations . at smaller @xmath64 ,",
    "the oscillations are damped more strongly , and the envelope approaches a gaussian decaying function .    [ fig2 ]    to see this in more detail , let us consider approximations of eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) in various regimes of interest .",
    "\\1 . in the metallic regime @xmath71 for @xmath72",
    "we obtain : @xmath73 where @xmath2 , which for @xmath74 reduces to the result obtained with the unitary wigner - dyson ensemble of random matrices@xcite .    \\2 . in the strongly localized regime @xmath75 ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath76 rescaling @xmath77 , we note the similarity to eq .",
    "( [ met ] ) .",
    "this result shows clearly that the correlations between energy levels belonging to states which are spatially separated by more than the localization length @xmath1 are weak . as a result",
    ", the asd shows only correlations with the period of twice the effective local energy level spacing @xmath78 of energy levels whose wave functions overlap spatially .    as @xmath79 , the function",
    "is dominated by the gaussian factor .",
    "thus , @xmath80 exactly as @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .    in fig .",
    "3 a plot of @xmath83 is shown , where @xmath84 . the asd is decaying from @xmath85 to @xmath86 as the frequency is held constant at @xmath87 and one varies the length of the wire @xmath16 or the parameter @xmath88 in fig .  3 ,",
    "compare with fig .  1 .    [ fig3 ]",
    "in summary , the asd is established as a tool to study the level statistics of disordered metals .",
    "an analytical expression is obtained for the asd of a quasi-1-dim . disordered mesoscopic wire . at frequencies below the mean level spacing @xmath3",
    "the asd approaches 1 like a gaussian for any value of the conductance g , and there is no information on localization in this regime .",
    "this was pointed out by efetov @xcite when studying the weakening of level repulsion by localization .",
    "it was stressed there , that the noncompact degrees of freedom are needed to describe localization that way . here",
    ", it is shown that the information is rather contained in the large frequency correlations .",
    "the asd shows a crossover to a strong damping of the correlations as the length of the wire exceeds the localization length @xmath1 , accompanied by the convergence of the period of the strongly damped oscillations to the constant @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the wire can be thought of as effectively separated into localization volumes , as obtained earlier in refs . .",
    "one may argue that , since the averaging over the impurity potential was done before normalization , the resulting function might contain different information than the one obtained by normalizing for a given impurity potential before doing the averaging@xcite .",
    "the goal of this article is however to show that level statistics can be characterized with the simplest tool , @xmath90 .",
    "now , it might become possible to address problems analytically , which could not be solved with the methods known so far , due to their complexity .",
    "while the asd can not contain any information on the eigenfunctions of the system , we have seen that it contains enough information to characterize the energy level statistics .",
    "the function @xmath91 may serve as a parameter characterizing localization  : it is @xmath85 in the metallic regime and @xmath86 , when all states at all energies are localized .",
    "it decays to approximately @xmath92 when the length of the wire coincides with the localization length , @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , recently it has been shown that the asd can contain information not only on a metal - insulator - crossover , but also on a -transition , as demonstrated with the anderson model on a bethe lattice@xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank uzy smilansky for drawing his attention to the asd as a tool to study level statistics , and thomas dittrich , konstantin efetov , dietrich klakow , d. e. khmelnitskii , igor lerner , daniel miller , vladimir prigodin and klaus ziegler for usefull discussions , and simon villain- guillot for critical reading of the manuscript .",
