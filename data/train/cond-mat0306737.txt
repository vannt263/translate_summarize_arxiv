    "recently there has been much interest in studying of the polyectrolyte multilayer microcapsules  @xcite .",
    "these capsules are made by layer - by - layer ( lbl ) adsorption  @xcite of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes onto charged colloidal particles with subsequent removal of the template core  @xcite and are important for a variety of applications such as drug delivery , catalysis , and biotechnology . at a more fundamental level ,",
    "polyelectrolyte microcapsules represent a convenient system for studying physical properties of free polyelectrolyte multilayer films .",
    "a free thin film geometry allows one to study properties not accessible in the bulk or in the supported films . in this way one might gain a better understanding of polyelectrolytes in general .",
    "mechanical properties are among the most important and almost certainly the least understood physical properties of free multilayer films .",
    "they define deformation and rupture of the capsule shell under an external load , which is important for instance in the development of the delivery systems for drug injection into blood vessels @xcite . this can also help to understand the principles underlying the mechanical behavior of living cells .",
    "for example , elastic properties of the capsule shell can be used as an input to models of penetration of particular viruses into the biological cell  @xcite .",
    "there have been three recent attempts to study mechanical behavior of polyelectrolyte microcapsules .",
    "the first involves observing osmotically induced buckling of capsules immersed in a polyelectrolyte solution  @xcite . in this method",
    "the external osmotic pressure induces instability in the capsule shape . if the capsule is highly permeable for the solvent ( water ) the capsule wall bends and",
    "a cup - like shape is formed .",
    "the second method is based on studying the swelling of microcapsules filled with the solution of a strong polyelectrolyte  @xcite .",
    "the third attempt involves measuring the deformation of microcapsules under applied load using atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the afm technique is its accuracy , the possibility of studying a wider range of systems , and richer experimental information : it allows one to distinguish between different regimes in load - deformation profiles , study permeability , elasticity , and plasticity of the capsule shell .    motivated by a recent afm study  @xcite , which was focused on the _ qualitative _ difference between various regimes in the load - deformation profiles and on the role of encapsulated polymers , we apply the afm approach to study _ quantitatively _ the elastic properties of the capsule shell . as an initial application of our method",
    "we have chosen to study the capsules with the shells composed of layers of alternating poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate ) and poly(allylamine ) hydrochloride .",
    "these multilayers are stable in various chemical environments . their thickness is known to grow linearly with the the number of deposited bilayers , so that they represent a convenient system for verification of our approach . beside that this type of the shells was used in the previous studies of mechanical properties of the capsules  @xcite .",
    "we work in a small deformation regime , which allows one to treat capsule deformations as elastic . by fitting load - deformation curves to the predictions of a simple model we are able to obtain the lower limit for young s modulus of the polyelectrolyte multilayer complex forming the capsule shell .",
    "the capsules were produced according to the method  @xcite based on lbl assembly of several bilayers of polystyrene sulfonate ( pss , @xmath1 , aldrich ) and poly(allylamine ) hydrochloride ( pah , mw @xmath2 , aldrich ) layers on a weakly crosslinked ( latex ) template . as a template we used suspensions of polydisperse poly - dl - lactic acid ( pla ) particles and monodisperse melamine formaldehyde particles ( mf ) purchased from microparticles gmbh ( berlin , germany ) .",
    "the pla particles were of a radius in the range from 2 to 8 @xmath3 m and were dissolved using 1:1 mixture of ( 1-methyl-2-pyrrolindinone ) acid and organic solvent ( acetone ) after assembly of four pss / pah bilayers  @xcite .",
    "this type of capsule is referred below as pla capsules .",
    "the mf particles were of radius @xmath4 @xmath3 m and were dissolved using hcl ( at ph @xmath5 ) to give so - called mf capsules .",
    "the variation of shell thickness was achieved by two methods . in the first method we varied the number of bilayers deposited on mf templates . in the second method we dissolved the mf particles after the deposition of the fourth bilayer .",
    "then several additional bilayers were deposited to tune the final shell thickness .",
    "load ( force ) vs deformation curves were measured with the molecular force probe ( mfp ) 2d afm ( asylum co , santa barbara , usa ) equipped with a nanopositioning sensor that corrects piezoceramic hysteresis and creep .",
    "the mfp was used together with a commercial confocal microscope manufactured by olympus ( japan ) consisting of the conconfocal laser scanning unit olympus fv 300 in combination with an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix70 equipped with a high - resolution immersion oil objective ( 60@xmath6 .",
    "the confocal microscope was specially adjusted for the mfp 2d .",
    "this allowed simultaneous optical measurements of the capsule s shape during the afm force experiment .",

    "since hysteresis is small and the load - deformation profiles do not depend on the driving speed ( in the interval used ) we can , in the first approximation , neglect drainage of the water through the capsule shell and assume that the volume of the capsule does not change on short time scale of the afm experiment .    to relate the relative deformation @xmath16 and the change in the capsule radius we further assume that , for small deformations , the shape of the capsule remains spherical except in the contact regions  @xcite ( see fig .",

    "balance of stresses defines the pressure @xmath49 inside the capsule @xmath50 using the relation between the stress and deformation tensors @xmath51 as well as the assumption that the deformed capsule has spherical shape @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 substituting eqs .",

    "the alternative ( and equivalent ) way to obtain the reaction force is to multiply the pressure @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure ] ) by the microcapsule - glass sphere contact area .    note , that here we ignored the contribution to the elastic energy due to shell bending .",
    "this is reasonable , for a very thin membrane , everywhere except near the line separating the capsule , glass sphere / substrate , and the exterior ( the edge of the contact area ) . an exact treatment of bending effects is rather complicated ; the bending moment could perturb the spherical shape of the membrane near a contact , etc .",
    "however , simple estimates of the bending energy can be made .",
    "the change from the membrane in contact with the glass sphere to the free membrane , at a contact angle @xmath57 , occurs over a length comparable to the shell thickness , @xmath32 .",
    "then the local radius of curvature of the membrane near the separation line is of the order of @xmath58  @xcite .",

    "the value @xmath73 was obtained from fitting .    for sufficiently large relative deformations , @xmath68 ,",
    "when we can safely neglect shell bending , our model also predicts the dependence of the reaction force on the capsule radius , given by the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stretching_force ] ) which depends on @xmath18 .",
    "this prediction is indeed confirmed by the experiment , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : load ] .    for mf capsules , prepared in the acid media without adding any solvent or organic acid , we obtained young s modulus of the shell of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "the experimental dependence of the load on the shell thickness is consistent with our model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness ] ) and confirms that bending is important only at very low @xmath16 .",
    "we also analyzed previously obtained data for mf capsules of the same chemical composition , but prepared by dissolution of a template in a more aggressive acid media ( 3 mol / l hcl )  @xcite .",
    "for these capsules we obtained a young s modulus of the pss / pah shell of the order of 30 mpa , and even a smaller value for the same capsules , but after treatment in organic solvent ( water / acetone mixture )  @xcite .",
    "several remarks can be made in conclusion .",
    "first , the young s modulus obtained here is at least one order of magnitude lower than in the experiment on osmotically induced deformation of pss / pah capsules made on the mf template @xcite .",
    "it can be argued that the theory of osmotically induced shape transition ( buckling ) of the capsules used in @xcite ignores finite permeability of the shell membrane to water .",
    "however , it is clear that the finite permeability stabilizes a spherical shape of the capsule , leading to higher values of critical osmotic pressure ( infinite for zero permeability ) or , equivalently , to smaller values of young s modulus .",
    "the consequences of overestimation of young s modulus in @xcite are very important .",
    "it led , in particular , to the conclusion that multilayers represent quite a rigid material comparable with the _ bulk plastics _  @xcite . in contrary to this",
    ", our experiment demonstrated that the value of the young s modulus of the multilayer corresponds to that of _ elastomers _",
    "it is likely that the approach ( model ) we used here underestimates the value of young s modulus , because it neglects the drainage of water from the capsule .",
    "these values ( @xmath0 mpa ) , therefore , give the lowest limit for young s modulus of polyelectrolyte multilayers .",
    "however , our results strongly support the conclusions of the recent swelling experiment  @xcite , which has given a slightly larger , but of the same order of magnitude , value for @xmath47 .",
    "we have argued  @xcite , that the osmotically induced swelling measurements give the upper limit for young s modulus .",
    "therefore , taking together , these two types of experiment provide the range of possible values for young s modulus of a pss / pah multilayer .",
    "second , the pla capsules are one or two order of magnitudes softer than mf capsules  @xcite . this is likely due to organic solvent and different ( and more concentrated ) acid used for a dissolution of the pla templates .",
    "similar effect is probably responsible for the softening of mf capsules made in different conditions  @xcite .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the polyelectrolyte multilayers are extremely sensitive to chemical treatment",
    ". the effect of softening of the multilayer shell could be due to either structure changes or partial dissolution of the shell , and is poorly understood at the moment  @xcite .",
    "forth , the adhesion force does not affect determination of young s modulus .",
    "indeed , as follows from the model , the area of the contact ( and the adhesion energy ) is proportional to the relative deformation @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the force due to adhesion does not depend on @xmath16 and will only uniformly shift the load - deformation profiles .    in summary , using the afm technique , we were able to estimate the young s modulus of the molecularly - thin polyelectrolite multilayer , which was found to be of the order of a @xmath0 @xmath75 .",
    "we also demonstrated that the elastic properties of the multilayer shell can be modified by treatment in a solvent and acid , and depends on the template used for the capsule preparation ."
