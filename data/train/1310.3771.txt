    "let @xmath0 denote a collection of open sets in @xmath1 , and define the associated geometric maximal operator @xmath2 by @xmath8    for some examples , if @xmath0 were the collection of all cubes or balls in @xmath1 , @xmath9 would be the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator ; while if @xmath0 were the collection of all rectangles in @xmath1 with sides parallel to the axes , @xmath9 would be the strong maximal operator . due to the importance of these classical operators we adopt the special notation @xmath10 for the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator and @xmath11 for the strong maximal operator . to avoid confusion , we will sometimes let @xmath12 denote the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator @xmath13 with respect to balls , and let @xmath14 denote the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator with respect to cubes",
    ".    we will also consider the _ centered _ hardy - littlewood maximal operator defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the euclidean ball of radius @xmath17 , centered at @xmath18 .",
    "a similar definition gives @xmath19 , defined with respect to centered cubes .",
    "observe that , strictly speaking , these centered operators does not fall under the scope of our general definition for @xmath20 as there is no collection @xmath21 that will generate @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this is essentially due to the centered nature of the sets defining @xmath24 .    given a collection @xmath0 as above , we are typically interested in determining if the associated maximal operator @xmath9 is bounded on @xmath25 for some and also what are the optimal weak type @xmath26 estimates that @xmath9 satisfies .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator @xmath13 is bounded on @xmath25 for all @xmath27 and that it satisfies the weak type @xmath28 estimate : @xmath29    even weaker conditions on geometric maximal operators are so - called _ tauberian conditions_. the maximal operator @xmath2 is said to satisfy a _ tauberian condition with respect to @xmath30 _ if there is some constant @xmath31 such that @xmath32 holds for all measurable sets @xmath33 .",
    "note that the previous condition is only supposed to hold for some _ fixed _ @xmath30 .",
    "now , if @xmath2 is known to satisfy a weak type @xmath28 estimate or to be bounded on @xmath34 for some @xmath35 , then it is easily seen that @xmath2 must satisfy a tauberian condition with respect to @xmath4 , for _ all _ @xmath36 .",
    "however , a maximal operator @xmath2 can in fact satisfy a tauberian condition with respect to some @xmath36 without being @xmath37 bounded for any finite @xmath38 .",
    "a quick example of this type of behavior can be exhibited by , say , letting @xmath0 be the collection of all sets of the form @xmath39 \\cup(x , x+2)$ ] and observing that , while @xmath2 satisfies a tauberian condition with respect to 4/5 , it is not bounded on @xmath40 for any @xmath35 .    a tauberian condition on a maximal operator ,",
    "although quite weak , is still very useful , as was shown by a. crdoba and r. fefferman in their work @xcite relating the @xmath34 bounds of certain multiplier operators to the weak type @xmath41 bounds of associated geometric maximal operators ; see @xcite for details .",
    "moreover , hagelstein and stokolos have shown in @xcite that , provided @xmath0 is a homothecy invariant basis of convex sets in @xmath1 , if @xmath0 satisfies a tauberian condition with respect to _ some _",
    "@xmath36 , then @xmath2 must be bounded on @xmath25 for sufficiently large @xmath38 .",
    "this work has recently been extended by hagelstein , luque , and parissis in @xcite to yield weighted @xmath37 bounds on maximal operators satisfying a tauberian condition with respect to a weighted basis .",
    "the issue of _ sharp tauberian constants _ is one that has received very little attention until recently . for specificity , given a maximal operator @xmath2",
    ", we define the tauberian constant @xmath5 by    @xmath42    we note here that , in the relevant literature , the function @xmath43 defined as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is many times called the _",
    "halo function _ of the collection @xmath21 , as for example in @xcite . obviously , it is equivalent to study the function @xmath46 for @xmath47 which is the setup we adopt in this paper .",
    "we will use the special notation @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the sharp tauberian constants corresponding to the basis of balls , cubes , and axes parallel rectangles , respectively . for the centered hardy - littlewood maximal operator",
    "we denote the corresponding sharp tauberian constants by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "now , if the maximal operator @xmath2 satisfies a weak type @xmath28 estimate @xmath53 then the associated sharp tauberian constant @xmath5 must satisfy @xmath54 however , we might expect in many situations @xmath5 to be significantly smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "for example , even though the weak type @xmath28 bound of the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator @xmath13 acting on functions on @xmath56 is 2 , we would suspect it unlikely to find a set @xmath33 contained in @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "we will show momentarily that this indeed can not be the case , and in fact that we must have @xmath58    the first estimates along the lines of the one above were obtained by solyanik in @xcite . in his honor",
    ", we call a result of the form @xmath7 a _ solyanik estimate_.    [ t.solyanik ] we have the following solyanik estimates : @xmath59 in particular , @xmath60 for the sharp tauberian constant of the centered hardy - littlewood maximal operator ( with respect to cubes or balls ) we have @xmath61 and in particular @xmath62 as @xmath63 .    note that solyanik s theorem does not include an estimate for @xmath64 associated to the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator with respect to balls , @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , solyanik concludes the estimate for @xmath66 as a corollary of estimate for @xmath67 and thus the methods in his paper do not readily apply to non - centered maximal operators defined with respect to balls .",
    "however , the method of solyanik for centered maximal operators deals equally well with balls or cubes .",
    "this is because the basic underlying ingredient for these estimates in the case of centered operators is the besicovitch covering lemma which works equally well for balls or cubes .",
    "we now introduce the directional maximal operator @xmath68 , @xmath69 , acting on @xmath70 and defined by @xmath71 in the next section we will prove a solyanik estimate for the iterated maximal operator @xmath72 , namely that we have @xmath73 this will be done by proving a solyanik estimate for @xmath13 on @xmath74 by a means different than solyanik did in @xcite but one enabling us to afterwards apply induction to get the desired estimate for @xmath75 . subsequently we will provide a solyanik estimate for the uncentered maximal operator @xmath76 by utilizing the circle of ideas developed by a. crdoba and r. fefferman in their work @xcite relating covering lemmas to weak type bounds of geometric maximal operators . afterwards",
    "we will visit the issue of generalizing solyanik estimates to encompass maximal operators @xmath2 where @xmath0 is a homothecy invariant collection of convex sets . throughout this paper",
    "we will indicate open problems and directions for further research .",

    "we also write @xmath80 if @xmath77 and @xmath81 . if the constant @xmath82 depends for example on the dimension @xmath83 we will write @xmath84 .",

    "as @xmath13 is of weak type @xmath28 we must have that @xmath97 is of finite measure . indeed , if @xmath98 then we must have @xmath99 .",
    "accordingly there exists a finite subcollection @xmath100 of @xmath92 such that @xmath101 arguing as in @xcite*p .",

    "now observe that for any @xmath115 we have @xmath116 by the case already proved .",
    "since the left hand side of the estimate above does not depend on @xmath117 we can let @xmath118 to get the lemma for @xmath119 as well .",
