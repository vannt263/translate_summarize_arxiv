    "one of the most spectacular results of the iras satellite survey was the discovery of galaxies with huge luminosities in the far - infrared ( far - ir , @xmath3 8 - 1000 @xmath4 m ) ( e.g wright et al , 1984 ) .",
    "the far - ir luminosity of these objects typically exceeds their optical and uv luminosity by factors of 2 - 80 ( see sanders & mirabel , 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "these far - ir galaxies are relatively common in the nearby universe ; at lower luminosities ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 l@xmath7 h@xmath8 = 100 km",
    "s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) their space density is comparable with that of markarian starbursts , whilst at the highest luminosities , @xmath9 10@xmath10 l@xmath7 , they are roughly as common as quasars of similar power output ( sanders et al 1989 , rowan - robinson 1995 ) .",
    "objects this powerful have been termed ultraluminous infrared galaxies , ulirgs .",
    "there are many unanswered questions regarding these ulirgs .",
    "it is still unclear just what powers their far - ir emission , especially at the highest luminosities , or what evolutionary role they play in the development of galaxies .",
    "recent results from iso are suggesting that starbursts , rather than agn , may dominate their luminosity ( lutz et al 1996 ) , but this issue is still far from settled ( see eg .",
    "lonsdale et al . 1998 ) .",
    "one of the main obstacles to our understanding of ulirgs is the small number so far uncovered in the iras source catalogues .",
    "for example , only 3 % of the iras bright galaxy sample ( sanders et al 1988 ) had luminosities @xmath9 10@xmath10 l@xmath7 , the defining characteristic of a ulirg for our assumed value of h@xmath1 .",
    "the 10 ulirgs discovered in the bgs are the best studied of this class of object , but it is only with larger samples that we may perform the statistical studies necessary to reveal their range of properties and their true evolutionary role in the universe . of the 10 bgs ulirgs , 9 possess high ionization spectra , typical of objects powered by an active nucleus , and all 10 seem to be merging or interacting systems ( sanders et al 1988 ) . on this basis",
    "it has been suggested that ulirgs are an early stage in the development of quasars .",
    "larger flux limited surveys of iras galaxies , and lists of ulirgs discovered as a result , are gradually becoming available .",
    "recent work includes kim et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which includes extensive analysis of both nuclear and off - nuclear spectroscopy , and fisher et al .",
    "other ulirg surveys are discussed in sanders and mirabel ( 1996 ) and in clements et al .",
    "( 1996a , hereinafter paper 1 , and 1996b ) .",
    "the evolutionary role of ulirgs is also of great interest .",
    "it is still unclear whether the rapid evolution of iras galaxies ( e.g. saunders et al . 1990 ) parallels the density evolution of the faint blue population ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1988 , colless et al . 1990 ) or the luminosity evolution of radio galaxies and quasars ( boyle et al . 1988 ; dunlop & peacock , 1990 ) .",
    "samples of iras galaxies based on the iras point source catalogue ( psc ) contain too few galaxies at cosmologically significant redshifts to distinguish between the two types of evolution .",
    "selection from the deeper faint source survey may be able to reach the necessary depths .",
    "we have thus been conducting a programme to identify candidate ulirgs over a large region of sky ( @xmath11 0.7 steradians ) using the faint source survey to reach a limiting flux of 0.3jy at 60@xmath4 m .",
    "the first results from this survey programme were discussed in paper 1 .",
    "that paper provided basic data on 91 ulirgs found in our survey region .",
    "the present paper presents the results of further spectroscopy of candidate ulirgs in the same area , including the discovery of 11 new or probable ulirgs .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the selection techniques for our survey . in section 3",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "our results are presented in section 4 , while in section 5 we discuss these results and the current status of the survey . in section 6",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume h@xmath1 = 100 kms@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and q@xmath1 = 0.5 throughout .",
    "the targets for the present observations are all part of the large ulirg survey first described in paper 1 . a detailed description of our selection techniques can be found there , but we include a brief summary here .    the basic data for the survey is the iras faint source survey v1.2 ( moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) and uk schmidt telescope survey plates covering the region b@xmath12 and -32.5@xmath13 @xmath14 dec @xmath14 + 2.5@xmath13 .",
    "iras sources with galaxy - like colours were identified with optical counterparts on the scanned plates using a maximum likelihood technique ( sutherland & saunders , 1992 ; paper 1 ) .",
    "to select ulirg candidates from this list , we then examine the optical / far - ir flux ratio .",
    "it has been found that the optical galaxy luminosity function has a rather sharp cut - off at high luminosities , with almost no galaxy having l@xmath15 .",
    "the far - ir luminosity function , in contrast , has no such cut - off .",
    "any galaxy with an extreme ir luminosity will thus have a large ratio of optical to infrared flux , @xmath16 .",
    "we thus define :    @xmath17 = { \\f60 \\over f_{b}}\\ ] ]    @xmath18    and select sources with either @xmath19 or @xmath20 as candidate ulirgs .",
    "there are 479 sources that meet this criterion and are above our adopted 60@xmath4 m flux limit of 0.3 jy in our survey area .",
    "literature searches and the observations described in paper 1 have identified 278 of these sources as galaxies and a further 3 as stars .",
    "of the 278 galaxies , 91 turned out to be ulirgs , suggesting that we have a @xmath1133% success rate for finding ulirgs with this technique .",
    "this contrasts very well with the @xmath21 of iras sources found to be ulirgs in simple flux limited samples .",
    "the observational targets for the present paper have been selected from the remaining 198 sources that have yet to have redshifts measured .",
    "the observations were carried out on the eso 3.6 m telescope using the efosc1 instrument on the nights of 29  31st july 1995 .",
    "the efosc1 instrument uses a 512 by 512 tektronix ccd and can provide both imaging observations and , via a slit and grism , spectroscopy ( melnick , 1995 ) .",
    "for the present observations , acquisition images were made using the standard r band filter , and spectroscopy was obtained using the r300 grism .",
    "this provides a spectral range of 5940  9770 .",
    "the resolution was measured using the arc lamp to be 16.5 . in imaging mode ,",
    "the plate scale is 0.6 arcseconds per pixel .",
    "acquisition images were typically 120s long , while spectra received typical integration times of 300s .",
    "the data were reduced in the usual way using the iraf system .",
    "bias frames were subtracted and then the images were flat fielded , using sky flats for images and dome flats for the spectra .",
    "spectra were wavelength calibrated using a helium - argon arc lamp .",
    "conditions were generally non - photometric and with seeing ranging from 1 to 2 arcseconds . the spectroscopic standard ltt7379 was used to flatten the ccd response function and to provide some correction for the a and b atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "the most prominent line in almost all ulirg optical spectra is usually the h@xmath226563 + nii6548/6583 doublet blend . in many cases only this line and the sii6716/6731 doublet",
    "are detected , since strong dust absorption in these objects suppresses emission lines at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the redshifts for these objects are thus generally calculated from these two emission lines only , using gaussian fits to the lines .",
    "the resolution of the observations are not quite high enough to allow a full deconvolution of the h@xmath22-nii blend , but they are high enough to allow an estimate to be made of the relative strengths of the h@xmath22 and nii lines in some cases . if nii emission is stronger than h@xmath22 , we classify the object as having a high excitation spectrum , usually seyfert 2 or liner - like .",
    "a high excitation spectrum can indicate objects containing an active nucleus .",
    "our previous observations ( paper 1 ) using fosii at the wht with a resolution of 25  could not achieve this .",
    "of the 65 objects observed , redshifts were obtained for 51 , including 11 new or probable ulirgs .",
    "five proved to be stars and 6 had featureless spectra .",
    "table 1 presents the basic parameters for the new ulirgs discovered in this work , while appendix a provides information for the non - ulirg iras galaxies that we have identified .",
    "figure 1 presents the spectra for the new ulirgs , while figure 2 presents their images ."
