    "large - scale jets produced in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are spectacular manifestations of an efficient extraction of energy and momentum from supermassive black holes and their accretion disks @xcite . for many years since their discovery",
    ", these structures have been studied almost exclusively at radio frequencies @xcite , and only recently the new generation of sensitive , high - resolution optical and x - ray instruments , in particular the _ hubble _ space telescope and the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , enabled a truly multiwavelength investigation ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in the cases of distant quasars ,",
    "an in - depth analysis of the optical or x - ray jet structure is however often hampered by a limited photon statistics ; only a few targets are bright enough and sufficiently extended on the sky that a more detailed comparison between radio , optical , and x - ray maps can , in principle , be attempted .",
    "till now , tens of large - scale jets in various types of agn have been detected in x - rays , and several related _ chandra _ surveys and population studies have been presented in the literature @xcite . due to the fact that the x - ray fluxes of various segments of the jets in luminous quasars exceed the extrapolation of radio  to  optical synchrotron continua , this x - ray emission is interpreted as either inverse - comptonization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite , or synchrotron emission of a distinct electron population @xcite .",
    "the former model requires highly relativistic bulk velocities of the jet plasma on tens- and hundreds - of - kpc scales ( bulk lorentz factors @xmath3 ) or very weak jet magnetic fields , while the latter scenario assumes an efficient _ in - situ _ acceleration process maintaining high energies of radiating particles ( electron lorentz factors @xmath4 ) along the outflows .",
    "we note that the x - ray jet emission in low - power radio galaxies is typically consistent with the extrapolation of the concave synchrotron continua from lower frequencies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "several crucial observational findings collected during the last decade points toward the synchrotron interpretation of the x - ray emission of large - scale quasars jet ; these are summarized and discussed in more detail in section  [ s : discussion ] below .",
    "still , the exact nature of the particle acceleration process(es ) involved remains under debate .",
    "part of the difficulty here is due to the fact that the main physical parameters of the discussed objects  and in particular their bulk velocity profiles , content , and magnetization  are largely unconstrained",
    ". a detailed multi - wavelength analysis of the morphological and spectral properties of large - scale quasar jets are therefore required , but as mentioned before such can be performed in reality only for a few brightest and good resolved targets .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the available best - quality radio , far - ultraviolet , and x - ray data for a particularly prominent jet in the core - dominated quasar 3c273 ( see  [ s : data ] below ) .",
    "the jet has been studied in the past at various frequencies by a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the novelty of the investigation presented here lies in a careful image analysis involving combined , high - photon statistics datasets , including image deconvolution and forward - fitting of a multi - component image models ( see  [ s : analysis ] ) .",

    "we have analyzed all the available _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) data for the large - scale jet in the quasar 3c273 .",

    "chandra _ point spread function ( psf ) depending on @xmath14 , we have also extracted a subset of the data characterized by the best spatial resolution .",
    "in particular , we have selected 13 observations with @xmath15 ( see table[tab : data_xray ] ) .",
    "this subset was then used only for the analysis of a small - scale x - ray sub - structure of the 3c273 jet , in which case the size and the exact shape of the psf are crucial ; for other types of the analysis we have utilized the entire available _ chandra _ dataset .",

    "a visual inspection of figure[fig : xr_knots_con ] uncovers a clear curvature of the 3c273 large - scale , followed by both the radio and the x - ray  emitting plasma ; the fuv jet traces a similar , almost sinusoidal trail . in general",
    ", the x - ray and fuv knots can be matched with their prominent radio counterparts , although conspicuous differences between the x - ray / fuv and radio morphologies can be noted as well .",
    "first , as already emphasized in  [ s : transverse ] , the radio outflow is wider than the deconvolved x - ray / fuv jet .",
    "second , the intensity peaks of the x - ray knots are found to be located systematically _ upstream _ of the corresponding radio intensity peaks . in the case of the knot b1",
    ", this offset appears particularly dramatic , with the radio intensity peak displaced from the x - ray intensity peak not only in the longitudinal direction , but also in the transverse direction .",
    "here we investigate such offsets more quantitatively .",
    "we note however that the exact positions of the fuv knots may be affected by the limited astrometry calibration related to the fact that the quasar core is not included in the analyzed _ hubble _ field ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; for this reason below we discuss only the _ vla _ and _ chandra _ data .        keeping in mind that the knots in 3c273 jet are not located along a straight line , we estimated the x - ray / radio positional offsets as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the exact coordinates of the intensity peaks of x - ray and radio knots , respectively , calculated using coordinates of the corresponding centroids on the deconvolved maps .",
    "we considered only those knots for which the peak positions can be measured with high accuracy ; we also skip the problematic b1 segment of the outflow , in which case the identification of the x - ray knot with its radio counterpart is particularly confusing .",
    "the distribution of thus evaluated positional offsets , which range from @xmath20 up to @xmath21 , is presented in figure[fig : offset ] ; the errors included in the figure correspond to the 1px=@xmath13 deviation .",
    "this distribution seems to reflect , at least to some extent , a wiggling appearance of the outflow depicted in figure[fig : xr_knots_con ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a number of observational findings regarding multiwavelength properties of large - scale quasar jets contradict the idea ascribing the observed x - ray jet emission to the inverse - comptonization of the cmb photons by lower - energy electrons ( @xmath22 ) characterized by a relativistic bulk motion ( hereafter the ` ic / cmb ' model ) .",
    "first , the detections of x - ray counter - jets in high - power radio galaxies pictora and 3c353 ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) , which are misaligned counterparts of radio - loud quasars , excludes any significant beaming involved .",
    "second , prominent spatial offsets between the positions of radio and x - ray intensity peaks observed in many systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with the global longitudinal radio and x - ray jet intensity profiles @xcite , as well as general constraints on the bulk jet velocities following from radio population studies @xcite , are hard to be reconciled with the ic / cmb model , or at least with its ` single - emission - zone ' version .",
    "one possibility  discussed in the particular context of 3c273 @xcite  could be therefore that the low - energy ( radio  to  infrared / optical ) emission component is produced in the outer , slower jet boundary layer / jet cocoon , while the high - energy ( optical / uv  to  x - ray ) emission component is due to the ic / cmb process related to a fast jet spine .",
    "the optical / uv polarimetry of the pks1136135 jet , presented by @xcite , implies however that this high - energy continuum can not be inverse - compton in origin , but that it constitutes instead an additional , separate synchrotron component .",
    "we note that the ic / cmb model was also claimed to be inconsistent with the detected x - ray variability of the pictora jet @xcite , and to stand in conflict with the @xmath23-ray properties of the 3c273 system @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , _ chandra _ studies of distant radio - loud quasars seem to indicate that the ic / cmb emission may dominate radiative outputs of large - scale jets in , at least , high - redshift `` core - dominated '' systems , due to the strong increase of the cmb energy density in the early universe , @xmath24 , as argued in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "still , focusing the discussion on the particular case of the nearby 3c273 , and keeping in mind all the observational results summarized above , from now on we continue our discussion assuming the ` two synchrotron component ' model for the broad - band jet emission .",
    "the detailed analysis of the large - scale morphology of quasar 3c273 presented in this paper reveals that the fuv and x - ray jet emission is produced in a series of knots with transverse sizes of about @xmath0kpc and lengths @xmath25kpc , tracing the extremely well - collimated spine surrounded by a wider radio cocoon .",
    "the nature of the knots in quasar jets is in general subjected to the ongoing debate . in the case of hydrodynamical outflows with dynamically negligible magnetic field",
    ", such intensity enhancements may correspond to either stationary reconfinement shocks , or moving portions of the jet matter with excess kinetic power ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the positional x - ray / radio intensity peak offsets , which are confirmed here for the analyzed target , could in principle be reconciled with the latter scenario ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "on the other hand , in current - carrying jets , brightness enhancements may correspond to the development of large - scale magnetohydrodynamical instabilities , as observed in 3d simulations of relativistic , two - component outflows consisting of a central component with helical , dynamically relevant magnetic field , surrounded by a slower sheath / cocoon or a boundary layer with velocity shear ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , the `` wiggling '' appearance of the fuv / x - ray jet in 3c273 , particularly prominent on the deconvolved maps , seems to be in tune with such a possibility .",
    "moreover , a strong magnetization of the jet spine may in fact be consistent with the requirement for a continuous _ in - situ _ acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons along the outflow .",
    "radiative cooling timescales of synchrotron optical or especially x - ray emitting electrons in large - scale agn jets are much shorter than the dynamical timescales involved .",
    "this implies the action of very efficient particle acceleration processes taking place along the outflows , which are not restricted solely to localized compact regions but instead distributed throughout the entire jet body ( see in this context the detailed analysis by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was proposed that these processes are related to stochastic interactions of radiating electrons with magnetic turbulence , expected to be particularly effective at the jet boundaries ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other option , possibly more consistent with the multi - wavelength jet morphology of the 3c273 jet disclosed by our analysis , could be however magnetic reconnection taking place in a highly magnetized jet spine .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context the most recent results of the plasma kinetic simulations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which revealed in accord that the reconnection process in relativistic plasma leads to the formation of power - law electron spectra , with energy indices @xmath26 depending on the plasma magnetization parameter @xmath27 , and in particular increasing from @xmath28 for @xmath29 up to @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "such a dependance seems to be qualitatively consistent with the uv  to  x - ray spectral properties of 3c273 jet ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming that the magnetization parameter within the jet spine  traced by the chain of the fuv / x - ray brightness enhancements  decreases gradually from the position of knot a up to the terminal hotspot h2/h3 ( projected distance from the quasar core @xmath32kpc , or de - projected @xmath33kpc for the expected jet viewing angle @xmath34deg ; see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , it is not clear if the maximum electron energies available in the reconnection - related acceleration mechanisms captured in the aforementioned simulations are sufficient to account for the synchrotron emission extending up to x - ray frequencies , taking into account the expected sub - mg magnetic field intensity in large - scale quasar jets . indeed , assuming a poynting flux - dominated outflow with the total power @xmath35 not exceeding @xmath36ergs@xmath6 , and predominantly toroidal magnetic configuration ( for simplicity ) , the jet - frame magnetic field on large scales , @xmath37 , reads as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the jet radius , and @xmath40 is the jet bulk lorentz factor . with such",
    ", the production of synchrotron x - rays requires @xmath4 electrons ."
