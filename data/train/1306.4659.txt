    "after the recent observation of nonzero @xmath0 by the daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite , and double chooz  @xcite experiments , five parameters in the neutrino sector have been measured by neutrino oscillation experiments . in general , there are nine parameters in the light neutrinos mass matrix .",
    "the remaining four unknown parameters may be taken as the lightest mass , the dirac cp phase and two majorana phases .",
    "the dirac phase will be measured in future long baseline neutrino experiments , and the lightest mass can be determined from beta decay and cosmological experiments . if neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath2 ) is detected , a combination of the two majorana phases can also be probed .",
    "if there is some structure in the neutrino mass matrix , the four unknown parameters will be related to each other . in this paper",
    ", we study the phenomenological consequence of imposing one texture zero or one cofactor zero in the light neutrino mass matrix ; for previous work see refs .  @xcite . since one texture or cofactor zero sets two conditions on the parameter space , only seven free parameters in the light neutrino matrix remain . here",
    "we derive analytic formulas that relate the seven free parameters and determine the constraints on these models . by using recent data measured by neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "we exclude some cases for the normal or inverted mass hierarchy , and for the rest we can obtain the allowed regions for the lightest mass and dirac cp phase , which can be probed in the next generation of neutrino experiments .    in sec .",
    "2 , we discuss the general properties of texture or cofactor zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix . in sec . 3 , we use current experimental data to study the allowed parameter regions for one diagonal texture zero in the mass matrix . in sec .",
    "4 , we study the allowed parameter regions for one diagonal cofactor zero in the mass matrix . in sec .",
    "5 we discuss the similarities between one texture zero models with one mass hierarchy and one cofactor zero models with the opposite mass hierarchy .",
    "we present a simple realization based on a new @xmath1 gauge symmetry for the one cofactor zero models in sec . 6 and",
    "summarize our results in sec . 7",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 the results of a recent global three - neutrino fit  @xcite are shown in table  1 .",
    "the masses of light neutrinos can be obtained from the canonical seesaw mechanism  @xcite , in which the mass matrix of the light neutrinos can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 yukawa coupling matrix and @xmath10 is the @xmath9 heavy right - handed neutrino mass matrix .",
    "here we assume all three light neutrinos are massive , so that the mass matrix of the light neutrinos is invertible ( and therefore @xmath8 must be invertible ) , and we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw ] ) as @xmath11 since @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 cofactor of @xmath15 , and both the light and heavy neutrino mass matrices are symmetric , any cofactor zeros in the mass matrix are equivalent to texture zeros in the inverse of the mass matrix .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( 4 ) implies that if the yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal , then a cofactor zero in @xmath15 implies a texture zero in @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a texture zero in @xmath15 implies a cofactor zero in @xmath10 when the yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal .",
    "normal & @xmath16&@xmath17&@xmath18&@xmath19&@xmath20 + inverted & @xmath16&@xmath21&@xmath22&@xmath19&@xmath23 +    an interesting feature of the structure of a texture or cofactor zero is that it is stable against radiative corrections . the one - loop renormalization group equation ( rge ) describing the evolution of the light neutrino masses from the lightest right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath24 to the electroweak scale @xmath25 is  @xcite @xmath26 , \\label{eq : rge}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the renormalization scale and @xmath29 is the charged lepton yukawa coupling matrix . in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the gauge couplings , @xmath35 is the top quark yukawa coupling , and @xmath36 is the higgs self - coupling .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rge ] ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38,\\ ] ] and @xmath39,\\ ] ] for @xmath40 . since multiplying diagonal matrices does not affect a texture or cofactor zero , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgesolution ] ) , we see that texture or cofactor zero models are stable against the rge running from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "we discuss the properties of one texture zero in the diagonal entries of the mass matrix ; the results for the off - diagonal cases can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which were obtained in models with four texture zeros in the yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows . for one texture zero cases ,",
    "there are 7 independent parameters in the light neutrino mass matrix , which we take to be @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath0 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , the dirac cp phase @xmath45 , and either @xmath46 ( for the normal hierarchy , nh , @xmath47 ) or @xmath48 ( for the inverted hierarchy , ih , @xmath49 ) . for each case",
    "we find the allowed regions in the @xmath46- ( @xmath48- ) @xmath45 plane given the best - fit values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath0 , @xmath50 and @xmath44 , and also the @xmath51 allowed regions using the experimental uncertainties in the measured parameters .",
    "we also find iso-@xmath52 contours relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay for the best - fit values .",
    "the condition @xmath53 can be written as @xmath54 and is the same for either mass hierarchy .",
    "taking the absolute square gives @xmath55 or , defining @xmath56 , @xmath57 expanding the cosines yields the form @xmath58 with a , b and c as listed in table  [ tab : abc ] .",
    "hence the only condition that must be satisfied when @xmath53 is @xmath59 . since @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not depend on @xmath45 , it will only yield a constraint on @xmath46 for the normal hierarchy or @xmath48 for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath62 can not be satisfied for the inverted hierarchy , which means that @xmath53 is not possible for the inverted hierarchy . for the normal hierarchy and best - fit oscillation parameters ,",
    "the allowed range for @xmath46 is @xmath63 , while the allowed range at 2@xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : mee ]    the minimum value of @xmath52 for the best - fit oscillation parameters and the @xmath51 lower bounds for the diagonal cases are shown in table  [ tab : mee ] .",
    "results for the off - diagonal cases can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the diagonal cases that are not excluded ,",
    "the minimum @xmath52 s are all below @xmath67  mev and can only be completely probed by significant improvements in the sensitivity of @xmath2 experiments . for classes",
    "@xmath53 nh , @xmath68 nh and @xmath69 nh , the current lower bound on @xmath52 is zero .",
    "however , as we have shown , for larger values of the lightest neutrino mass ( especially in the quasi - degenerate region ) the similarity of the allowed regions between a texture - zero nh and the corresponding cofactor zero - ih ( and a texture - zero ih and the corresponding cofactor - zero nh ) makes it difficult to distinguish them simply with measurements of the oscillation parameters and the neutrino mass scale . in order to resolve this ambiguity , future experiments that can determine the mass hierarchy",
    "are strongly needed , such as long baseline neutrino experiments ( t2k  @xcite , no@xmath70a  @xcite , and lbne  @xcite ) , atmospheric neutrino experiments ( pingu  @xcite and ino  @xcite ) and medium baseline reactor experiments ( daya bay ii  @xcite ) .",
