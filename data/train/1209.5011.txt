    "computational algorithms are constructed on the basis of certain primitive operations .",
    "these operations manipulate data that describe `` numbers . ''",
    "these `` numbers '' are elements of a `` numerical domain , '' that is , a mathematical object such as the field of real numbers , the ring of integers , different semirings etc .    in practice ,",
    "elements of the numerical domains are replaced by their computer representations , that is , by elements of certain finite models of these domains .",
    "examples of models that can be conveniently used for computer representation of real numbers are provided by various modifications of floating point arithmetics , approximate arithmetics of rational numbers  @xcite , interval arithmetics etc .",
    "the difference between mathematical objects ( `` ideal '' numbers ) and their finite models ( computer representations ) results in computational ( for instance , rounding ) errors .    an algorithm is called _ universal _ if it is independent of a particular numerical domain and/or its computer representation  @xcite .",
    "a typical example of a universal algorithm is the computation of the scalar product @xmath0 of two vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 by the formula @xmath3 .",
    "this algorithm ( formula ) is independent of a particular domain and its computer implementation , since the formula is well - defined for any semiring .",
    "it is clear that one algorithm can be more universal than another .",
    "for example , the simplest newton  cotes formula , the rectangular rule , provides the most universal algorithm for numerical integration .",
    "in particular , this formula is valid also for idempotent integration ( that is , over any idempotent semiring , see @xcite ) . other quadrature formulas ( for instance , combined trapezoid rule or the simpson formula ) are independent of computer arithmetics and can be used ( for instance , in the iterative form ) for computations with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "in contrast , algorithms based on gauss ",
    "jacobi formulas are designed for fixed accuracy computations : they include constants ( coefficients and nodes of these formulas ) defined with fixed accuracy .",
    "( certainly , algorithms of this type can be made more universal by including procedures for computing the constants ; however , this results in an unjustified complication of the algorithms . )    modern achievements in software development and mathematics make us consider numerical algorithms and their classification from a new point of view .",
    "conventional numerical algorithms are oriented to software ( or hardware ) implementation based on floating point arithmetic and fixed accuracy .",
    "however , it is often desirable to perform computations with variable ( and arbitrary ) accuracy . for this purpose ,",
    "algorithms are required that are independent of the accuracy of computation and of the specific computer representation of numbers .",
    "in fact , many algorithms are independent not only of the computer representation of numbers , but also of concrete mathematical ( algebraic ) operations on data . in this case",
    ", operations themselves may be considered as variables .",
    "such algorithms are implemented in the form of _ generic programs _ based on abstract data types that are defined by the user in addition to the predefined types provided by the language .",
    "the corresponding program tools appeared as early as in simula-67 , but modern object - oriented languages ( like @xmath4 , see , for instance , @xcite ) are more convenient for generic programming .",
    "computer algebra algorithms used in such systems as mathematica , maple , reduce , and others are also highly universal .    a different form of universality is featured by iterative algorithms ( beginning with the successive approximation method ) for solving differential equations ( for instance , methods of euler , euler  cauchy , runge ",
    "kutta , adams , a number of important versions of the difference approximation method , and the like ) , methods for calculating elementary and some special functions based on the expansion in taylor s series and continuous fractions ( pad approximations ) .",
    "these algorithms are independent of the computer representation of numbers .",
    "the concept of a generic program was introduced by many authors ; for example , in  @xcite such programs were called ` program schemes . ' in this paper , we discuss universal algorithms implemented in the form of generic programs and their specific features .",
    "this paper is closely related to  @xcite , in which the concept of a universal algorithm was defined and software and hardware implementation of such algorithms was discussed in connection with problems of idempotent mathematics , see , for instance ,  @xcite .    the so - called _ idempotent correspondence principle _ , see  @xcite , linking this mathematics with the usual mathematics over fields , will be discussed below . in a nutshell",
    ", there exists a correspondence between interesting , useful , and important constructions and results concerning the field of real ( or complex ) numbers and similar constructions dealing with various idempotent semirings .",
    "this correspondence can be formulated in the spirit of the well - known n.  bohr s _ correspondence principle _ in quantum mechanics ; in fact , the two principles are closely connected ( see  @xcite ) . in a sense ,",
    "the traditional mathematics over numerical fields can be treated as a ` quantum ' theory , whereas the idempotent mathematics can be treated as a ` classical ' shadow ( or counterpart ) of the traditional one .",
    "it is important that the idempotent correspondence principle is valid for algorithms , computer programs and hardware units .    in quantum mechanics",
    "the _ superposition principle _ means that the schrdinger equation ( which is basic for the theory ) is linear .",
    "similarly in idempotent mathematics the ( idempotent ) superposition principle ( formulated by v.  p.  maslov ) means that some important and basic problems and equations that are nonlinear in the usual sense ( for instance , the hamilton - jacobi equation , which is basic for classical mechanics and appears in many optimization problems , or the bellman equation and its versions and generalizations ) can be treated as linear over appropriate idempotent semirings , see  @xcite .",
    "note that numerical algorithms for infinite dimensional linear problems over idempotent semirings ( for instance , idempotent integration , integral operators and transformations , the hamilton  jacobi and generalized bellman equations ) deal with the corresponding finite - dimensional approximations .",
    "thus idempotent linear algebra is the basis of the idempotent numerical analysis and , in particular , the _ discrete optimization theory_.    b.  a.  carr  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) used the idempotent linear algebra to show that different optimization problems for finite graphs can be formulated in a unified manner and reduced to solving bellman equations , that is , systems of linear algebraic equations over idempotent semirings .",
    "he also generalized principal algorithms of computational linear algebra to the idempotent case and showed that some of these coincide with algorithms independently developed for solution of optimization problems .",
    "for example , bellman s method of solving the shortest path problem corresponds to a version of jacobi s method for solving a system of linear equations , whereas ford s algorithm corresponds to a version of gauss ",
    "seidel s method .",
    "we briefly discuss bellman equations and the corresponding optimization problems on graphs , and use the ideas of carr to obtain new universal algorithms .",
    "we stress that these well - known results can be interpreted as a manifestation of the idempotent superposition principle .    note that many algorithms for solving the matrix bellman equation could be found in  @xcite .",
    "more general problems of linear algebra over the max - plus algebra are examined , for instance in  @xcite .",
    "we also briefly discuss interval analysis over idempotent and positive semirings .",
    "idempotent interval analysis appears in  @xcite , where it is applied to the bellman matrix equation .",
    "many different problems coming from the idempotent linear algebra , have been considered since then , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "it is important to observe that intervals over an idempotent semiring form a new idempotent semiring .",
    "hence universal algorithms can be applied to elements of this new semiring and generate interval extensions of the initial algorithms .",
    "this paper is about software implementations of universal algorithms for solving the matrix bellman equations over semirings . in section  [ s : sem ] we present an introduction to mathematics of semirings and especially to the tropical ( idempotent ) mathematics , that is , the area of mathematics working with _ idempotent semirings _ ( that is , semirings with idempotent addition ) . in section  [ s : main ] we present a number of well - known and new universal algorithms of linear algebra over semirings , related to discrete matrix bellman equation and algebraic path problem .",
    "these algorithms are closely related to their linear - algebraic prototypes described , for instance , in the celebrated book of golub and van loan  @xcite which serves as the main source of such prototypes .",
    "following the style of  @xcite we present them in matlab code .",
    "the perspectives and experience of their implementation are also discussed .",
    "a broad class of universal algorithms is related to the concept of a semiring .",
    "we recall here the definition ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "a set  @xmath5 is called a _ semiring _ if it is endowed with two associative operations : _ addition _  @xmath6 and _ multiplication _  @xmath7 such that addition is commutative",

    "an element @xmath19 is called _ invertible _ if there exists an element @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "a semiring  @xmath5 is called a _ semifield _ if every nonzero element is invertible .",
    "a semiring  @xmath5 is called _ idempotent _ if @xmath22 for all @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the addition  @xmath6 defines a _ canonical partial order _",
    "@xmath13 on the semiring  @xmath5 by the rule : @xmath23 iff @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to prove that any idempotent semiring is positive with respect to this order .",
    "note also that @xmath25 with respect to the canonical order . in the sequel",
    ", we shall assume that all idempotent semirings are ordered by the canonical partial order relation .",

    "the most well - known and important examples of positive semirings are `` numerical '' semirings consisting of ( a subset of ) real numbers and ordered by the usual linear order @xmath29 on  @xmath30 : the semiring  @xmath31 with the usual operations @xmath32 , @xmath33 and neutral elements @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the semiring  @xmath36 with the operations @xmath37 , @xmath38 and neutral elements @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the semiring @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 for all @xmath44 , @xmath45 if @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , and the semiring  @xmath48 } = [ a , b]$ ] , where @xmath49 , with the operations @xmath50 , @xmath51 and neutral elements @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
