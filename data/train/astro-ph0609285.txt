    "the power law index @xmath98 is typically @xmath99 @xcite , although the slope often steepens at velocities greater than 10 kms@xmath4 from the systemic velocity . from a compilation of 22 sources with luminosities ranging from 0.58 @xmath100 to @xmath101 , @xcite",
    "find that at velocities below 10 kms@xmath4 @xmath98 is similar , while at velocities above 10 kms@xmath4 , @xmath98 is @xmath102 for low - mass ysos and @xmath103 for luminous ysos . toward a sample of 11 objects with luminosities @xmath104",
    "at a distance of 2 kpc , @xcite do not find a correlation between mass - spectrum slope and bolometric luminosity nor a clear separation between @xmath98s measured for the high velocity and low velocity emission .",
    "@xcite also study the mass - velocity diagrams of outflows of two luminous ysos and find a change in slope at a break - point velocity of 10 kms@xmath4 .",
    "they suggest that the high velocity ( @xmath105 kms@xmath4 ) gas may drive the low velocity ( @xmath106 kms@xmath4 ) gas . with the assumption of the optically thin sio thermal emission in lte , we derive the mass - velocity diagrams for the sio outflows for the two sources ( see fig . [ mv ] ) .",
    "since the sio emission is dominantly redshifted in i18264 and blueshifted in i23151 , we derive the mass - velocity relations in the corresponding wings for the two sources . the redshifted emission in i18264 is mostly attributed to the se outflow .",
    "so fig . [ mv]a represents the mass - velocity relationship of the hc of the se outflow and can be fitted by a broken power law with the index steepening from @xmath107 to @xmath108 at @xmath109 kms@xmath4 .",
    "the mass distribution in the velocity channels of the vhc of the se outflow has large scatters and can hardly be described by a linear fit .",
    "similarly , the blueshifted lobe of the sio outflow in i23151 is also fitted by a broken power law with @xmath110 for @xmath106 kms@xmath4 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 kms@xmath4 . from three dimensional simulations of a dense molecular jet penetrating a dense molecular medium ,",
    "@xcite predict the change in slope at high velocities due to a jet - bow shear layer consisting of molecules which survived the jet terminal shock .",
    "models of material being accelerated by jet - driven bow shocks @xcite have reproduced a power law relationship between mass and velocity with @xmath113 increasing with decreasing molecular abundance in the jet .",
    "however , @xcite give an upper limit of 3.75 for @xmath113 , which is much less than the observed values .",
    "therefore the physical origin is still unclear for the broken power law of the mass - velocity diagrams .",
    "the sio in the gas phase of molecular outflows can be produced through the sputtering of si - bearing material in grains , where the sputtering is driven by neutral particle impact on charged grains in shocks @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ hcoint]a , the jet - like se outflow in i18264 coincides well with the h@xmath0co@xmath7 structure extending to the southeast , suggesting the sio emission in this region may arise from the interaction between the shocks driven by the jet or wind from the central ( proto)star and the dense ambient gas clump .",
    "such an interaction mainly exists in the redshifted lobe since the sio emission is dominantly redshifted . in fig .",
    "[ profile]a , the sio line at the downstream peak of the hc of the se outflow ( denoted as the southern cross in fig .",
    "[ sioint1]b ) shows a profile with a steep decrease toward the systemic velocity and a gradual redshifted wing , which suggests the sio enhancement arising from the quiescent material accelerated by the shock when the jet or wind impinges into the dense ambient gas .",
    "we have checked the corresponding single - dish sio spectrum and find that such a profile also exists .",
    "so the steep decrease toward the systemic velocity can not be due to the missing short spacings .",
    "this kind of sio profiles and interactions have been observed toward several low - mass outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the line profile at the downstream peak of the vhc ( denoted as the northern cross in fig . [ sioint1]b ) shows a very broad plateau in the redshifted wing with velocities up to about 60 kms@xmath4 from the systemic velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ profile]b ) .",
    "such a broad plateau is consistent with the flattened mass spectrum of the vhc in the mass - velocity diagram . for i23151",
    ", there is a good correlation between the sio clumps and the integrated h@xmath0co@xmath7 peaks . the sio line at the peak of the blueshifted lobe ( denoted as a cross in fig .",
    "[ sioint2 ] ) also shows a profile of a steep drop toward the systemic velocity and a gradual decline in the blueshifted wing ( see fig .",
    "[ profile]c ) , and this profile is confirmed in the single - dish data .",
    "so the sio emission in i23151 can also arise from the interaction between the jet or wind driven by the central ( proto)star and the dense ambient gas .    toward several low luminosity sources ( e.g. , l1448 , @xcite ; ngc 2264 g , @xcite ) ,",
    "it is observed that the flow velocity increases with distance from the driving source . on the contrary ,",
    "@xcite find the sio outflow velocities in l1157 decreasing toward the clumps farther away from the driving source . also considering the different orientations of the different pairs of sio clumps ,",
    "they explain this in terms of multiple shocks driven by a processing and episodic jet .",
    "the downstream peak of the hc of the se outflow in i18264 is farther away from the driving source than that of the vhc , which is similar to the sio outflow in l1157 . and",
    "the vhc of this outflow is northward offset from the hc .",
    "we suggest that the se outflow is driven by a precessing jet . in this scenario , the lower velocities of the hc",
    "as compared with the vhc imply a deceleration of the underlying jet after travelling a larger distance ; the vhc is younger and driven by newly formed shocks when the underlying jet is precessing to the north , and its flattened mass spectrum and the very broad line width suggest it does not experience significant deceleration .",
    "in addition , the vhc of the northwest sio clump is also slightly shifted to the south of the hc , and both the vhc and hc align in line with the vhc and hc of the se outflow , respectively .",
    "this also suggests the precessing scenario .",
    "most recently , the vla observations by @xcite resolve the western mm peak in i18264 into triple sources at 1.3 cm and 7 mm .",
    "one of the three sources shows a slightly rising spectral index between 3.6 cm and 1.3 cm and a flux density at 7 mm larger than the value extrapolated from the 3.6 cm and 1.3 cm observations .",
    "@xcite suggest this source to be a combination of a thermal jet and disk .",
    "this is consistent with our interpretation that the se outflow being driven by a precessing jet .    in case of i23151",
    ", the sio outflow in i23151 traces the inner parts of the large bipolar co outflow despite the additional feature to the south .",
    "as described above , the blueshifted outflow is revealed as a quasi - parabolic structure , which is coincident with the similar structures in the 3.4 mm continuum and h@xmath0co@xmath7 line emission and also coincident with the near - infrared cone - like nebulosity by @xcite .",
    "apparently , this can be interpreted as the molecular outflow being entrained by a wide - angle wind , where the low - intensity sio emission in the central region of the cone is due to the cavity cleared by the wind while the enhanced sio emission at the base of the outflow is caused by the interaction between the wind and the ambient material in the wall of the cavity .",
    "@xcite also reveal a bright point source at the tip of the cone - like nebulosity . as the point source locating at the center of the single - dish 1.2 mm peak , @xcite",
    "suggest it to be the protostar driving an outflow traced by the nebulosity .",
    "the astrometry of the point source is ( ra , dec)(j2000)=(23:17:21.02 , 59:28:48.0 ) from the comparison of the speckle image with the 2mass images and 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources .",
    "the position of the mm peak of our pdbi observations is ( ra , dec)(j2000)=(23:17:20.88 , 59:28:47.7 ) . considering the 2mass positional accuracy of @xmath114",
    ", the pdbi mm peak can be the same as the near - infrared point source .",
    "but it is also possible that the offset is real and the very bright near - infrared point source is too evolved to be a protostar and the driving source of the outflow corresponds to the interferometric mm peak which is not resolved in the single - dish 1.2 mm continuum with an @xmath115 resolution .",
    "the position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams of the sio outflows along the axes marked in fig .",
    "[ sioint1]a and fig .",
    "[ sioint2]a are shown in fig .",
    "[ pv ] . for i18264 ,",
    "in addition to the feature around the driving source with velocities near the systemic velocity , there are mainly two components in the pv diagram : the component with velocities increasing linearly with the distance from the driving source ; the component farther away from the driving source with maximum velocities decreasing with the increasing distance . compared with the channel maps in fig .",
    "[ siochan1 ] , we can find that these two components correspond to the vhc and hc of the se outflow in fig .",
    "[ sioint1]b .",
    "there is a pair of faint feature centered at about @xmath116 , which corresponds to the nw lobe of the se - nw outflow .",
    "the velocity structure of the peak emission of the vhc follows the so called `` hubble law '' and can be explained in terms of bow - shock acceleration .",
    "this is compatible with the interpretation that the vhc is excited by the newly formed shocks without undergoing significant deceleration .",
    "if the broken power law is caused when the low velocity ( @xmath106 kms@xmath4 ) gas comprises ambient gas entrained by the high velocity ( @xmath105 kms@xmath4 ) gas @xcite , the high velocity gas should inject momentum into the low velocity gas and decelerate when it travels downstream .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the velocity structure of the hc in the pv diagram of i18264 , where the maximum velocities decrease with the distance from the driving source . for i23151",
    ", the pv diagram roughly follows the hubble law . at the position about @xmath117 from the driving source , emission features have a relatively wide range of velocities .",
    "we carry out a study of sio outflows toward the high - mass star forming regions i18264 and i23151 . according to the h@xmath0co@xmath7 observations and sio line profiles , the sio emission in these two sources can be caused by the interaction between the jet or wind from the central young stars and the dense ambient gas .",
    "the mass - velocity relation of the hc of the se outflow in i18264 and the blueshifted outflows in i23151 also can be fitted by a broken power law with the slopes steeping at about 10 kms@xmath4 with respective to the systemic velocity . with the pv characteristic of the terminal velocities decreasing with the distance from the driving source , the low velocity ( @xmath106 kms@xmath4 ) gas probably comprises the ambient gas entrained by the high velocity ( @xmath105 kms@xmath4 ) gas .    toward i18264 , at least two quasi - perpendicular outflows with high collimation factors ( @xmath118 ) are resolved .",
    "the vhc of the se outflow has very high velocities up to @xmath119 kms@xmath4 .",
    "it is north offset from the hc , and its downstream peak is farther away from the driving source . comparing with the outflows in the well studied low - mass source l1157",
    ", we suggest the se outflow can be entrained by an underlying precessing jet .",
    "the characteristics of the hc and vhc of the se outflow in the mass - velocity and pv diagrams also support the processing jet scenario . for i23151",
    ", the blueshifted sio emission traces a quasi - parabolic shaped outflow which can be identified in the 3.4 mm continuum and h@xmath0co@xmath7 emission and coincide with the near - infrared nebulosity in the literature .",
    "this outflow can be interpreted as the molecular gas entrained by the underlying wide - angle wind .",
    "the core masses estimated from the 3.4 mm continuum are 570 @xmath83 and 7300 @xmath83 respectively for the near and far distances for i18264 and 170 @xmath83 for i23151 . with the assumption of the momentum conservation between the outflow and the driving agent , the estimated outflow rates lead to accretion rates of @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively for the near and far distances for i18264 and @xmath95 for i23151 .",
    "taking into account the missing flux due to the the missing short spacings for i23151 , the accretion rate in this region should be higher .",
    "thus for both sources the accretion rates are high enough to overcome the radiation pressure from the central objects and form massive stars .",
    "to summarize , our molecular outflow data derived from high resolution observations toward two luminous sources show morphologies and kinematics similar to those of the low - mass sources .",
    "the outflows can be interpreted by jet or wide - angle wind entrainment models .",
    "the presented data and analysis further support that massive stars up to @xmath9 ( @xmath120 ) form via disk mediated accretion processes as low - mass stars .",
