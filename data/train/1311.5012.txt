    "the direct measurement of the reaction or capture ( fusion ) cross section is a difficult task since it would require the measurement of individual cross sections of many reaction channels , and most of them could be reached only by specific experiments",
    ". this would require different experimental set - ups not always available at the same laboratory and , consequently , such direct measurements would demand a large amount of beam time and would take probably some years to be reached . because of that , the measurements of elastic scattering angular distributions that cover full angular ranges and optical model analysis have been used for the determination of reaction cross sections .",
    "this traditional method consists in deriving the parameters of the complex optical potentials which fit the experimental elastic scattering angular distributions and then of deriving the reaction cross sections predicted by these potentials .",
    "even so , both the experimental part and the analysis of this latter method are not so simple . in the present work we present a much simpler methods to determine reaction and capture ( fusion ) cross sections .",
    "they consist of measuring only elastic or quasi - elastic scattering at one backward angle , and from that , the extraction of the reaction or capture cross sections can easily be performed .",

    "note that the deep inelastic collision process is only important at large energies above the coulomb barrier . here",
    "we neglect the deep inelastic collision process , since we are concerned with low energies .",
