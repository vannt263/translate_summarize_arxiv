    "<S> we present the standard model calculation of the optical activity of a neutrino sea .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea that intergalactic space is a birefrigent medium for light due to the presence of a neutrino sea has been contemplated for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> some thirty years ago , royer @xcite computed in @xmath0 theory an effect of order @xmath1 . later </S>",
    "<S> , stodolsky noted that due to a theorem of gell - mann @xcite , there can be no such effect with massless neutrinos and a point - like coupling , and his observation was recorded by one of the present authors in a review @xcite . in the early 1980 s data on propagation of radio waves through intergalactic space put a stringent upper bound on possible optical activity of the neutrino sea @xcite and @xcite and this led to renewed estimates for the size of such effect on the assumption of a neutrino magnetic moment , which occur for a massive neutrino @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently @xcite an evaluation was made for a off - mass shell photons within the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we note that there is a frequency dependent effect even for real photons and we also comment on the effect for virtual photons ( both within the sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we shall consider three possible effects : a magnetic moment effect , an effect for virtual photons , an effect for real photons . </S>",
    "<S> + if the neutrino has a magnetic moment , this moment will interact with the magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave :    @xmath2    in this equation @xmath3 is the polarization vector of a photon of momenta @xmath4 , while @xmath5 is the neutrino bispinor , and @xmath6 is the neutrino magnetic moment in bohr magnetons @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> + with this interaction ( 1 ) the forward scattering amplitude of a photon of momentum @xmath8 from a neutrino of momentum @xmath9 is equal to    @xmath10    this amplitude differs for left - handed and right - handed photons :    @xmath11    and gives rise to a nonzero optical activity for a polarizes neutrino gas . + in the standard model the neutrino has no intrinsic magnetic moment , but a magnetic moment can emerge as a one loop effect if the neutrino is massive(see figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the order of magnitude of the magnetic moment is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the weak mixing angle ; @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> constant @xmath16 can be obtained by direct calculation @xcite    @xmath17    thus a nonzero optical activity appears in this case as a two - loop effect @xmath18    it was understood long ago that @xmath19 scattering takes place as a one - loop process even for massless neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> the first estimates were performed in the fermi theory but erroneously @xcite . according to gell - mann s theorem @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude should vanish for point - like interactions . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat later levine @xcite evaluated the scattering mediated by w boson exchange and found a nonzero amplitude ( see figure 2 ) . due to gauge invariance </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude starts with the second power of the momentum of the photon @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> levine computed the first non - vanishing term , which in the sm looks like :    @xmath20    this amplitude is even under parity , in other words it is the same for right - handed photons and left - handed photons , so it can not contribute to optical activity . </S>",
    "<S> + very recently it has been found that by expanding to the next term of order @xmath21 one finds non - vanishing p - odd terms . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this calculation is @xcite :    @xmath22    this amplitude vanishes for real photons but is non - vanishing for virtual photons . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude is singular with respect to the electron mass and comes entirely from the diagram 2a . + it is interesting to ask whether one can get a parity violating amplitude for real photons . </S>",
    "<S> we find a positive answer to this question . in the same order of expansion over small momenta @xmath8 ( @xmath23 ) </S>",
    "<S> one finds the amplitude :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 this does not vanish for real photons and contributes to the optical activity of neutrino gas . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic term in equation ( 10 ) comes from diagram 2a , while the constant receives contributions from all diagrams of figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> + before we discuss the order of magnitude of the different amplitudes we note that the authors of reference @xcite have missed one diagram which contributes to off - shell photons . </S>",
    "<S> this is the diagram with @xmath26 exchange shown in figure 3 . for real photons </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath27 the triangle diagrams with different fermions inside the loop cancel each other , so that the standard model is anomaly free . </S>",
    "<S> but for off - shell photons each diagram gives a contribution proportional to @xmath28 , where m is the mass of the fermion running inside the loop . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution comes from the electron loop and is equal to @xmath29 of the contribution from diagram 2a ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of contributions from figure 2a and figure 3 gives    @xmath30    summarizing these results , we obtain the order of magnitude estimates : @xmath31    at low frequencies the scattering due to magnetic moment dominates even though it takes place at two - loop level : @xmath32 here we assume the neutrino at rest , i.e. @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> + as for the relative value of @xmath34 and @xmath35    @xmath36    this is sensitive to the @xmath37 value of the virtual photon . following the authors of reference @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we take for intergalactic space @xmath38 and assuming @xmath39 , we obtain :    @xmath40    for visible photons the on - shell activity is smaller than for off - shell photons , but in the @xmath41-ray region the reverse is the case . + in principle the contribution @xmath35 is similar to the rotation from the intergalactic magnetic fields , but the frequency dependence is very different . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical estimate shows that the contribution from the neutrino sea is many order of magnitude smaller than the magnetic ( faraday ) effect , observed with radio waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate , for radio waves and for @xmath42 neutrino sea with fermi momenta @xmath43 an effect of order @xmath44 @xmath45 which is insignificant compared to the faraday effect . at shorter wavelengths the rotatory power due to neutrino sea would increase . </S>",
    "<S> these small amplitudes are matched by very small cross sections for photon - neutrino scattering @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the scattering of laser photons with high energy intensive neutrino beam is discussed in the literature ( e.g. see @xcite ) . for this case </S>",
    "<S> the considered one - loop amplitude dominates over scattering due to magnetic moment : @xmath46 </S>"
