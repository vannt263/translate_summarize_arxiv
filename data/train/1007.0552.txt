    "natural sets of algebraic objects are often unions of two unequal parts , the larger part consisting of generic objects whose structure is uniform and relatively simple , and the smaller including exceptional cases which have much higher complexity and provide most of resistance to classification .",
    "the essence of this idea first appeared in the form of zero - one laws in probability , number theory , and combinatorics . in finite group theory",
    "the idea of genericity can be traced to a series of papers by erds and turan in 1960 - 70 s ( for recent results see  @xcite ) , while in combinatorial group theory the concept of generic behavior is due to gromov .",
    "his inspirational works @xcite turned the subject into an area of very active research , see for example  @xcite .",
    "we mention in particular the remarkable results due to kapovich and schupp on generic properties of one - relator groups @xcite and by maher @xcite and rivin @xcite on generic properties of random elements of mapping class groups and automorphisms of free groups , as well as the theorem by kapovich , rivin , schupp and shpilrain that generic cyclically reduced elements in free groups are of minimal length in their automorphic orbits @xcite . an earlier series of papers @xcite by arjantseva and olshanskii established the theory of subgroups of random groups and related questions .",

    "we show that with high probability a random subgroup of a nonelementary hyperbolic group has a simple structure and is embedded without much distortion of its intrinsic metric .",
    "arbitrary subgroups on the other hand , can be very complicated .",
    "a remarkable construction introduced by rips  @xcite shows that every finitely presented group @xmath0 is a quotient of a hyperbolic ( in fact small cancellation ) group @xmath1 by a finitely generated normal subgroup @xmath2 .",
    "the dehn function of @xmath0 is intimately related to the metric distorsion of the subgroup @xmath2 in @xmath1 . in particular , as rips noticed , the membership problem for @xmath2 in @xmath1 is undecidable provided the word problem in @xmath0 is undecidable .",
    "a host of undecidability results for subgroups of hyperbolic groups has been proven by combining the rips technique with known unsolvability results for finitely presented groups ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these results show that hyperbolic groups contain finitely generated subgroups with as much distortion as one pleases .",
    "however , it is widely believed that such subgroups are rare , and that most finitely generated subgroups of hyperbolic groups have an uncomplicated structure and not much distortion .",
    "we prove here that for each @xmath3 , with overwhelming probability ( relative to a natural distribution ) @xmath4-tuples of words in a given finite set of generators of a non - elementary hyperbolic group freely generate a free subgroup which is quasi - isometrically embedded into the ambient group .",

    ", if a given subgroup is not in the set @xmath6 the algorithm quickly recognizes this ( in quadratic time ) and halts with a failure message .",
    "another result we would like to mention here concerns with the complexity of the word problem in finitely presented groups .",
    "it turns out that many famous undecidable problems are , in fact , very easy on generic set of inputs .",
