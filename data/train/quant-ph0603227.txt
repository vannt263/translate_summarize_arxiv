    "a quantum computer is supposed to be an analog device designed for implementation of quantum algorithms .",
    "the most important algorithm is the shor s quantum algorithm for factorization of large integer numbers  @xcite . before experimental realizatation of this and other complex quantum algorithms",
    ", this computer must be tested by implementation of simple algorithms , such as , for example , creation of entanglement with two quantum states ( and many qubits ) .",
    "this procedure would allow one to identify the most significant sources of errors and to optimize the quantum computer design .",
    "the following criteria  @xcite must be met by a physical implementation of a quantum information processor : ( i ) the qubits must be easy to physically manipulate , ( ii ) easy to increase the number of qubits , ( iii ) qubits should interact with each other , ( iv ) the qubits should be somewhat isolated from environment , and ( v ) the qubit states must be detectable .",
    "currently , solid state implementations of a quantum computer allow ( theoretical ) scalability [ criterion ( ii ) ] and possibility to substantially increase the number of qubits in the quantum computer register . in a solid state",
    "currently one and two - qubit quantum logic operations are implemented and measured experimentally .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance techniques have been used for quantum information processing in solids .",
    "etanglement between electron and nuclear spins of the same molecule has been implemented and measured in a malonic acid single crystal  @xcite and in @xmath2n@c@xmath3 endohedral fullerene  @xcite .",
    "quantum process tomography has been performed on a solid - state qubit represented by a nitrogen - vacancy defect in diamond  @xcite at room temperature .",
    "initialization ( cooling ) of nuclear spin has been realized in isotopically labeled malonic acid molecules by a controllable transfer of polarization from neighboring nuclear spins  @xcite at room temperature .",
    "one and two - qubit quantum logic operations have been implemented and measured in superconducting quantum computers  @xcite",
    ". a further technological advance can be implementation of simple quantum computing algorithms in a scalable solid state system with a large ( more than two ) number of qubits for demonstration of basic principles of quantum computation . in this paper",
    ", we consider how to implement , probably , the simplest possible algorithm with many qubits : creation of entanglement . to implement this algorithm",
    ", we choose one of the most affordable systems : a spin chain placed in a permanent magnetic field with a gradient along the chain .",
    "there is a constant dipole - dipole interaction between the qubits .",
    "the logic operations are implemented by rectangular radio - frequency pulses .",
    "this setup allows one to achieve all criteria ( i)-(v ) .    indeed , criterion ( i ) is satisfied because in the system there are no switchable interactions controlled by nanoscopic metal gates , and quantum logic operations are implemented using global addressing technique based on rectangular radio - frequency pulses .",
    "criterion ( ii ) is satisfied because we consider solid - state qc architectures and because rectangular pulses can be used in the qc with many qubits and all parameters of the applied pulses can be determined analytically .",
    "the number of pulses in our entanglement protocol is equal to the number of qubits in the chain . the long - range constant magnetic dipole - dipole interaction satisfies criterion ( iii ) . in the majority of spin - based quantum computer architectures",
    "this is the only interaction when neighboring qubits are separated from each other at the distances @xmath4 nm . criterion ( iv ) is satisfied because our system allows implementations using qubits with long decoherence times .",
    "one possible implementation is based on nuclear spins , for example nuclear spins of @xmath5p  @xcite , @xmath6si  @xcite , or li  @xcite in @xmath7si .",
    "another implementation is based on endohedral fullerenes , @xmath2n@c@xmath3 and @xmath5p@c@xmath3  @xcite , where the fulleren cage provides a good isolation of electron or nuclear spin of the enclosed atom of nitrogen or phosphorus from the environment .",
    "the electrons of the nitrogen or phosphorus atoms have spin 3/2 , and the nuclei have spin 1/2  @xcite . consequently , our protocols can work only for the nuclear spins of the endohedrals .",

    "such a gradient can be created by current(s ) flowing along the @xmath9 axis in the plain formed by the chains .",

    "we will show in this paper that the sign of @xmath14 and the dependence of @xmath14 on different parameters of the model can provide us the information about the main source of error .",
    "this information can be useful for benchmarking the quantum computer and optimization of its architecture and parameters of quantum protocols .",
    "we consider the implementation of entanglement only for one spin chain of the ensemble of chains illustrated in fig .  1 . since the chains experience the same conditions the dynamics of all chains is similar .",

    "<S> creation of entanglement is considered theoretically and numerically in an ensemble of spin chains with dipole - dipole interaction between the spins in each chain . </S>",
    "<S> the unwanted effect of the long - range dipole interaction is compensated by the optimal choice of the parameters of radio - frequency pulses implementing the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the errors caused by ( i ) the influence of the environment , ( ii ) non - selective excitations , ( iii ) influence of different spin chains on each other , ( iv ) displacements of qubits from their perfect locations , and ( v ) fluctuations of the external magnetic field are estimated analytically and calculated numerically . for the perfectly entangled state </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 component , @xmath1 , of the magnetization of the whole system is equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the errors lead to a finite value of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if the number of qubits in the system is large , @xmath1 can be detected experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> using the fact that @xmath1 depends differently on the parameters of the system for each kind of error , varying these parameters would allow one to experimentally determine the most significant source of errors and to optimize correspondingly the quantum computer design in order to decrease the errors and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> using our approach one can benchmark the quantum computer , decrease the errors , and prepare the quantum computer for implementation of more complex quantum algorithms . </S>"
