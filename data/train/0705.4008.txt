    "the study of the semileptonic decay @xmath14  @xcite is interesting in many respects . in the standard model ,",
    "the rate of this weak decay is proportional to the square of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath15 , which is a measure of the weak coupling of the @xmath16 to the @xmath17 quark .",
    "this decay is also influenced by strong interactions .",
    "their effect can be parameterized by two axial form factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and one vector form factor @xmath20 , each of which depends on the momentum transfer squared @xmath21 of the @xmath22 meson to the  meson .",
    "the form of this dependence is not known _ a priori_. in the framework of heavy - quark effective field theory ( hqet )  @xcite , these three form factors are related to each other through heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) , but hqet leaves three free parameters , which must be determined by experiment .",
    "the extraction of  relies on the measurement of differential decay rates .",
    "hqs predicts the normalization of the decay rate at the maximum @xmath21 , and  is determined from an extrapolation of the form factors to this value .",
    "the precise determination requires corrections to the hqs prediction for the normalization , as well as a measurement of the variation of the form factors near the maximum @xmath21 , where the decay rate goes to zero as the phase space vanishes .",
    "several experiments have measured based on studies of the differential decay width for @xmath14decays  @xcite .",
    "these analyses of the one - dimensional differential decay rate resulted in the measurement of only one of the form - factor parameters , and they relied on a measurement by the cleo collaboration  @xcite for the other two .",
    "the uncertainty in these two parameters introduces the largest systematic uncertainty in all previous measurements of  using this method .",
    "furthermore , for measurements of @xmath23 , based on both inclusive and exclusive @xmath24 decays , improved knowledge of all form factors is important to correctly describe the dominant @xmath25 background .    in this paper , we present a simultaneous measurement of @xmath26 , of the branching fraction for @xmath14 , and of the three form - factor parameters , based on measurements of three one - dimensional decay distributions .",
    "thus we extend the earlier  measurement  @xcite where @xmath27 and one of the form - factor parameters are measured , fully accounting for correlations between these one - dimensional distributions .",
    "we combine the results of this analysis with another measurement of the form factors  @xcite , which employs a fit to the full four - dimensional decay distribution on a partial sample of the data .",

    "the effect of the uncertainties in the @xmath148 branching fractions has already been discussed ; it is subsample specific , but it affects all parameters because it changes the fraction of signal events from different @xmath148 decays .",
    "the uncertainty on the ratio @xmath177  @xcite affects both the absolute number of measured @xmath14decays and the ratio of background events from @xmath171 and @xmath178 decays in the simulation .",
    "this second aspect influences the @xmath152 distributions and therefore the background determination . for this reason ,",
    "this uncertainty affects also the form - factor parameters .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is equated with the observed change in the fit parameters for a one - standard deviation change in the value of @xmath179 .",
    "a sample of about 52,800 fully reconstructed @xmath14decays recorded by the  detector has been analyzed to extract both @xmath162 and the form - factor parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the caprini - lellouch - neubert parameterization  @xcite .",
    "the candidates are reconstructed from the decays and the  mesons are reconstructed in three different decay modes , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "electrons or muons are paired with the to form signal candidates .",
    "the large data sample has permitted a more precise determination of the background contributions , largely based on data , and thus has resulted in smaller experimental uncertainties .",
    "the results of the simultaneous fit to three one - dimensional projections of the decay rate are @xmath180 the stated uncertainties of the measurement here are the statistical and the total systematic one .",
    "the simultaneous fit to the three distribution reduces the uncertainty due to the form - factor parameters .    using an unquenched lattice calculation giving @xmath181  @xcite results in the following value for @xmath0 , @xmath182 here the third error is due to the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fwvcb ] shows the measured decay rate , integrated over angles , @xmath183 , as well as the fitted theoretical @xmath31 dependence ( see eq . [ eq : dgamma ] ) .    the branching fraction for the decay @xmath14is @xmath184      the  collaboration recently published a measurement  @xcite of the same form - factor parameters for @xmath14  decays based on an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit to the four - dimensional decay distribution ( eq . [ eq : totaldiffdecaywidth ] ) .",
    "this fit is sensitive to the interference of the three helicity amplitudes and thus results in significant smaller uncertainties on the form - factor parameters .",
    "the fit does not attempt an absolute normalization of the decays , and thus is not sensitive to @xmath162 .",
    "it resulted in @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "we combine the two  measurements of the form - factor parameters , taking into account the correlation between them , and obtain @xmath188 compared to the analysis presented in this paper , the combined result has significantly smaller statistical uncertainties of the form - factor parameters . the event sample and the sample of monte carlo simulated events used in ref .",
    "@xcite are a subset of the one used in the present analysis , namely about 15,000 selected  candidates with @xmath189 decays combined with electrons . except for the selection of the @xmath148 decay , the event selection and",
    "the determination of the backgrounds shapes and the signal extraction are almost identical for the two analyses .",
    "therefore , all the detector - related systematic uncertainties should be the same , as well as the uncertainties from the background models and input parameters like the branching fractions .",
    "thus , we retain the systematic measurement uncertainties established in this paper .",
    "the combined statistical errors are still larger than the total systematic uncertainties , but not by a large factor .",
    "an upper limit for the correlation between the two measurements has been estimated on the basis of the ratio of the uncertainties , and is found to be less than @xmath190 .",
    "the correlation coefficients for the combined measurements are @xmath191    figure  [ fig : correlations ] shows the correlations between the fitted variables and their uncertainties , both for the present analysis and for the combined result with ref .",
    "the contours correspond to @xmath192 , _",
    "i.e. _ 39% cl .",
    "the correlations between the form - factor parameters are quite large , but their correlation with @xmath162 is less than 0.4 , and the sign of the coefficients differ , resulting in a much reduced overall dependence of @xmath162 on these form factors .    using the same lattice calculation for @xmath11  @xcite , we obtain an improved value for @xmath0 , @xmath193 where the third error reflects the current uncertainty on @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding branching fraction of the decay @xmath14is @xmath194 the combined results of the two  analyses supersede all previous  measurements of the form - factor parameters , of the exclusive branching fraction for the @xmath14decay , and of extracted from this decay .",
    "the value of the branching fraction presented here is smaller than the average of previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "this measurement combined with @xmath195  @xcite represents only @xmath196 of the total branching fraction for the @xmath197 decays .",
    "the remaining fraction of 35% is expected to involve higher - mass charm states .",
    "the branching fractions for decays to these individual higher - mass states are not well known , in particular those involving broad resonances or non - resonant @xmath198 states  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the two  measurements results in a further reduction of the form - factor uncertainties compared to the previous analysis  @xcite , for which the uncertainties on @xmath2 and @xmath3 had already been reduced by a factor of four or more , compared to the cleo measurement  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath1 has also been reduced , by a factor of five with respect to the measurement in ref .",
    "the correlation between @xmath199 and @xmath1 , which was sizable for all previous measurements , has been reduced significantly , and this also leads to a smaller uncertainty for @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath0 is fully compatible with the earlier measurement  @xcite , and most earlier measurements  @xcite , but it is significantly smaller than the cleo measurement  @xcite .    can also be extracted from inclusive @xmath200 decays .",
    "recent measurements of  rely on moments of the electron energy and the hadron mass spectrum , combined with moments of the energy photon spectrum in inclusive @xmath201 decays . here",
    "@xmath202 and @xmath203 refer to charm and strange hadronic states , resonant or non - resonant .",
    "global fits to such moments , as a function of the minimum lepton and photon energy have been performed in terms of two different qcd calculations , one in the so - called 1s scheme  @xcite and the other in the kinetic scheme  @xcite .",
    "the results are in very good agreement .",
    "the weighted average is @xmath204  @xcite ; the experimental and theoretical uncertainties are comparable in size .",
    "the experimental techniques and the theoretical calculations for exclusive and inclusive decays are completely different and uncorrelated . given the sizable experimental error and the large uncertainty of the form - factor normalization of the exclusive measurement , the results are consistent .",
    "this should give us confidence in the experimental methods employed and the theoretical calculations , but also an incentive to improve on both .",
    "we are grateful for the extraordinary contributions of our 2  colleagues in achieving the excellent luminosity and machine conditions that have made this work possible .",
