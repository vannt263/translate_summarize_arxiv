    "probability is fundamental to physics in more ways than one .",
    "probabilistic errors can never be avoided in experimental observations , individual particles and their initial conditions can not be tracked in classical physics , and quantum mechanics , which is the best available description of nature , is intrinsically probabilistic .",
    "while the basic concepts of probability can be introduced nicely through coin tossing and probability boards  @xcite , they remain setups in the realm of statistics without a direct connection to the physics laboratory .",
    "the pedagogy of probability for physics students has received attention , with many proposals of statistics - oriented experiments  @xcite and theoretical expositions  @xcite , providing interesting insights .",
    "a more physical example of radioactive decay , a natural random ( quantum ) process has also been used to teach and demonstrate probabilistic ideas  @xcite",
    ". however , a typical physics laboratory requires more experiments involving probability distributions and their manipulation .",
    "this paper is an effort in this direction where we describe a simple gadget to study the manipulation of probability distributions .",
    "imagine inserting the terminals of a dc voltmeter into the ac mains outlet .",
    "we expect it to display zero because the dc meter will respond to the average voltage which in this case is zero .",
    "the dc voltmeter is not designed to be sensitive to changes of voltage which occur at the frequency ( 50 - 60hz ) of a typical ac source .",
    "therefore , the only information we can get from such a measurement is the average voltage .    how does one measure the instantaneous voltage ?",
    "we need to `` store '' this value for long enough that a dc voltmeter will be able to read it .",
    "one way to do this is to connect a capacitor across the ac source .",
    "the capacitor will get charged ; the instantaneous voltage across it will determine the instantaneous charge on the capacitor plates .",
    "when the capacitor is disconnected from the circuit , the charge and hence the voltage , on the capacitor remains .",
    "this can be seen by joining the two terminals of the capacitor , whereby a spark is produced .",
    "this voltage can be measured by a high impedance dc voltmeter .",
    "the dc voltage measured across the capacitor is then the instantaneous ac voltage of the original source .",
    "this dc voltage is the key variable measured in our experiment .",
    "the experiment can be repeated and a different voltage will be obtained each time ! if the observation is repeated many times , it is indeed a random sampling of the ac voltage source .",
    "this randomly sampled voltage data can be used to construct the probability distribution of the voltage .",
    "what information about the ac source is contained in this probability distribution ?",
    "we will see that the probability distribution depends upon the type of ac waveform used . a triangular wave for example ,",
    "will give rise to a very different probability distribution as compared to a sine wave .",
    "furthermore , under certain restricted circumstances we can reconstruct the waveform from the voltage probability distribution .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate such a reconstruction for the case of a sine wave .",
    "the results presented here are an instructive demonstration of the role of probabilistic analysis in physics experiments .",
    "the apparatus is simple and cheap .",
    "elementary c - programs running on an ordinary pc are sufficient to accomplish the data analysis .",
    "the data analysis can also be performed using a graph paper , pencil and a pocket calculator .",
    "computer analysis is not essential but is instructive and opens up possibilities of playing around with various parameters .",
    "the experiment can be introduced in a physics laboratory course at several different levels . at the lowest level",
    "the data collected by the procedure described in section  [ description ] can be used to demonstrate the zero mean , maximum and minimum values and the rms voltage of an ac source . at the next level of the undergraduate physics laboratory",
    ", the analysis of sections  [ description ] ,  [ theory ] , and  [ results ] can be used to calculate the voltage probability distribution for different parameter values and to reconstruct the corresponding waveforms . at a more advanced level",
    ", the statistical analysis of section  [ simulation ] and simulations can be carried out with the help of computer programs ( available in numerical recipes  @xcite ) to bring out the quantitative statistical aspects of the experiment .",
    "the material in this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ description ]",
    "we describe the experimental apparatus .",
    "section  [ theory ] provides a theoretical analysis of probability distributions arising from a random sampling of voltages and waveform reconstruction from such a probability distribution .",

    "we compare the results of our experiments with data obtained from a simulation .",
    "the c - program used for the data analysis in section  [ results ] is provided in the appendix  [ program ] .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] contains a short discussion and conclusions .",
    "the experimental setup consists of a capacitor , a voltmeter , an ac source and a double pole switch .",
    "the voltmeter is connected across the capacitor which is in turn connected to the source through the switch .",
    "the switch when pressed disconnects the source from the capacitor . at this instant",
    "the capacitor begins to discharge through the voltmeter . upon pressing the switch a second time ,",
    "the source is reconnected to the capacitor .",
    "the voltmeter remains connected across the capacitor throughout .",
    "a good digital voltmeter with high internal resistance and small capacitance should be used .",

    "this happens because the ac is oscillating too rapidly for the dc meter to be able to follow the voltage .",
    "then the switch is pressed to disconnect the ac source and at this stage the voltmeter shows the instantaneous dc voltage across the capacitor . the maximum value shown on the meter",
    "is recorded .",
    "this voltage is our main observation .",
    "the voltage across the capacitor will decay slowly as it discharges through the voltmeter .",
    "we are not interested in this decay .",
    "the switch is pressed a second time to reconnect the ac source .",
    "this completes one measurement cycle . to repeat the observation , at some stage",
    "the switch is pressed again and the maximum voltage developed across the capacitor is recorded .",
    "the experiment is repeated several times and a list of voltages is generated .",
    "this is our basic data set from which we want to draw our conclusions .",
    "it is useful to have two students recording the data ; one presses the switch and the other records the maximum voltage on the voltmeter . in some voltmeters",
    "the voltage first rises and then begins to fall . to a good approximation",
    "we take the maximum voltage to be the instantaneous voltage across the capacitor .",
    "an ideal voltmeter will not have this problem ; however , no instrument is ideal so there is always a finite measurement time over which the voltage across the voltmeter builds up from zero . to accurately measure",
    "the voltage across the capacitor is an interesting exercise in itself ; the best way is to actually measure the charge accumulated on the capacitor using a sensitive device like a ballistic galvanometer .",
    "it will be interesting to develop newer instruments which can be used in undergraduate laboratories and which can measure charge to a good accuracy .",
    "however , for our experiment such precise measurement of voltage across the capacitor is not required .",
    "we now turn to the theoretical analysis of random sampling and probability distributions .",
    "consider a time - dependent observable quantity , say a voltage @xmath1 .",
    "if we measure this voltage @xmath2 random times in an interval , @xmath3 , we can determine the distribution function @xmath4 , the number of times the measurement of @xmath5 results in a value between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . we denote the corresponding probability distribution of values of @xmath8 by @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    given @xmath11 , what is @xmath12 ? consider a measurement of @xmath8 being done between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the measured value @xmath15 , will be between @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "i.e. , between @xmath11 and @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the times at which the voltage is equal to @xmath6 , i.e. , all the solutions of the equation , @xmath19 if @xmath20 is the probability of the measurement being done at time @xmath21 , then the probability of the outcome of a measurement being between @xmath15 and @xmath22 is , @xmath23 where , @xmath24 we can always invert @xmath1 in the neighborhood of each @xmath25 .",
    "so let @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that the random times of measurement are uniformly distributed so that @xmath27 . we then have , @xmath28 hence , @xmath29",
    "@xmath30    for @xmath31 , every @xmath6 occurs twice at the times , @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by the rhs of the above equations .",
    "we can now use the formula in eqn .",
    "( [ pvform ] ) to get , @xmath35 independent of @xmath6 .",
    "basically , @xmath11 is spending equal times at all voltages between @xmath36 and @xmath37 and thus all voltages in this range are equally likely .",
    "@xmath38    here , every voltage between @xmath39 and @xmath40 occurs exactly once at , @xmath41 applying eqn .",
    "( [ pvform ] ) as before yields , @xmath35 again , independent of @xmath6 .",
    "in fact the probability distributions for the triangular and sawtooth waveforms are exactly the same . in both cases",
    ", @xmath5 spends equal times at all voltages between @xmath36 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath42    each value of the voltage occurs twice , @xmath43 applying eqn .",
    "( [ pvform ] ) gives , @xmath44 in sections  [ results ] and  [ simulation ] we show the comparison of this calculation with the probability distribution computed from the experimental data using a sinusoidal waveform .",
    "having determined the probability distribution @xmath12 , the question now is , given @xmath12 , what can we say about @xmath11 ? in general , it is not possible to reconstruct @xmath11 from @xmath12 since many functions can have the same probability distribution of values .",
    "however , as we will see , with some additional information about the function , it is possible to reconstruct it .",
    "we first consider the case when @xmath11 is a one - to - one and hence invertible function .",
    "we denote the inverse of @xmath5 by @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the probability that a measurement is done between @xmath21 and @xmath47 , then , @xmath48 where @xmath21 is the time when the voltage is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "from now , we will restrict ourselves to uniform distributions for the random measurements , i.e. , @xmath49 we also have @xmath50 hence , @xmath51 we now need some additional information about @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath11 is one - to - one , then it is monotonic .",
    "assume that it is monotonically increasing .",
    "we can then integrate the above equation to get @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath52 can then be inverted to get @xmath11 .",
    "another situation where @xmath11 can be reconstructed is if we are given that it is a periodic function with period @xmath55 , has exactly one minimum ( and hence one maximum ) in a period and is symmetric about its maximum and minimum .",
    "a sinusoidal waveform which we use for our experiment is an example of such a function . in this case , we know that it monotonically increases for half the period and monotonically decreases for the other half of the period . furthermore , if we are sampling over times large compared to the time period , then we randomly sample _ all _ the times in a period .",
    "so we can replace @xmath56 by the half - period @xmath57 in all the above formulae , reconstruct @xmath11 for the half period and then using the symmetry , recover the function for the full period .",
    "we can get to the wave shape from the probability distribution in this case ; however , we are unable to find the signal frequency .",
    "we now turn to the experimental results and their analysis . for good statistics ,",
    "a large number of voltages should be recorded , although interesting results begin to emerge with a sample size as low as 100 .",
    "the results in this section pertain to a sample size of 500 data points with a 50hz ac source having a peak voltage of @xmath58v .",
    "the 500 raw data points ( used in the analysis ) are shown in figure  [ raw - data ] .",
    "the raw data clearly look random and it is not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions by mere visual inspection .",
    "the first step in the analysis is to choose a certain number of bins and find the probability distribution of voltage .",
    "this is achieved by the c program given in appendix  [ program ] . in figure  [ prob_dist ]",
    "we show the graph corresponding to the probability distribution for the voltages divided into 101 uniform bins .    furthermore , since the function in this case satisfies the conditions for reconstruction , we use the formula given in eqn .  [ reconstruct - eq ] and numerical integration ( carried out by the second part of the c program given in appendix  [ program ] ) for waveform reconstruction and display the results in the lower half of figure  [ prob_dist ] . the expected sinusoidal waveform emerges .",
    "the actual sine curve is also provided as a solid curve in the same graph for comparison .",
    "if we start with a larger raw data set we can improve the quality of reconstruction and also reduce the statistical fluctuation in the probability distribution plot .",
    "a detailed statistical analysis is presented in section  [ simulation ] .",
    "we observe here that _ the probability distribution reveals the characteristics of the waveform which are not at all obvious from the raw data .",
    "_    we note here that there is no way of estimating the frequency of the signal .",
    "the sampling times , being random , do not give us any time - scale information ; hence the reconstruction gives us only the shape of the signal .",
    "for example , two sine waves with different frequencies and same amplitudes will give the same probability distribution and hence the same reconstructed waveforms .",
    "it is instructive to play with the parameters of the experiment .",
    "different frequency and amplitude for the ac can be tried and the experiment can be repeated with different waveforms like triangular or saw tooth and others .",
    "one can change the total number of points in the raw data and see how the statistics improves by increasing the sample points , which will be taken up in the next section .",
    "for the data analysis the number of bins is the only crucial parameter and it is interesting to see how the quality of analysis changes as we change the bin size . as a demonstration ,",
    "we re - analyze the same data described above by varying the number of bins to 11 and 1001 .",
    "one observes ( see figs .",
    "[ bin_variation1 ] and  [ bin_variation2 ] ) that 11 bins a give much less accurate probability distribution and waveform ; however going to 1001 bins does not help much compared to 101 bins .",
    "the 101 bins are able to capture more information available in the data compared to 11 bins , leading to the improved quality of the result .",
    "since the raw data has only 500 points , there is a limit to which we can improve the quality by increasing the bin number .",
    "if we want to improve the results further we must increase the number of raw data points and not the bin number .",
    "this is a general principle of experimental observations wherein the accuracy of the result is determined by the least accurate part of the observation and analysis .",
    "as seen in the preceding section , the data when analysed fit well into a sinusoidal curve , reproducing the original voltage form .",
    "we now analyse the goodness of this fit and deviations from the expected ( theoretical ) values .    when a sinusoidal waveform is sampled @xmath2 times randomly , the voltage probability distribution of eqn .",
    "( [ pvdv ] ) results in the frequency distribution of events @xmath59 and the accumulated frequency of events upto a voltage @xmath6 obtained on integration is @xmath60 for discrete bins of size @xmath61 , the integration is replaced by a sum over bins , @xmath62 . in other words , by a cumulative process of adding the frequencies in bins , starting from the @xmath63 bin to the @xmath64 bin , we recover the sine ( actually sine - inverse ) form .",
    "the @xmath2 data are binned into @xmath65 bins ; assuming that each sample is a random independent event , the statistical error for the frequency in each bin can be taken to be @xmath66 .",
    "thus the error on @xmath67 is @xmath68 , where there are @xmath69 bins from @xmath63 to @xmath70 . with this error",
    ", the accumulated frequency @xmath71 is fitted to the form in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : acfreq ] ) , with @xmath37 as the free parameters , by a standard chi - squared minimisation procedure : @xmath72    the result of the fitting procedure for the set of 500 sample data from a transformer stepped down to peak voltage ( a ) 8.6 v , and ( b ) 17.1 v , is shown in table  [ tab : chidata ] .",
    ".fits to 500 samples of data of an ac voltage with peak voltage @xmath73 , binned into 91 voltage bins .",
    "[ tab : chidata ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , data with smaller voltages at the transformer give better fits to the original sine waveform than data with larger voltages .",
    "as expected , the quality of fit improves with amount of data .",
    "a simple experiment was constructed to randomly sample an ac voltage source .",
    "the crux of the experiment involved charging a capacitor from an ac source , whose instantaneous voltage is then measured by switching its connection to a dc voltmeter at a random time .",
    "the resulting data were analysed to recover information about the ac source .",
    "while the frequency of the source could not be determined , the peak voltage and the _ shape _ of the original waveform could be accurately found . the procedure involved in inverting the data to recover this information was tested through numerical simulations and statistical analysis .",
    "the experiment , along with the analysis , can be effectively introduced into a physics laboratory course at the primary or advanced level .",
    "the effects of changing the switching device ( to limit losses due to sparking , etc . )",
    ", the peak voltage of the ac source , and the voltage measuring device , can be studied at various levels of complexity , depending on the ability and inclination of the reader .",

    "we give here the c program used for the data analysis . the input to the program is a data file ` input.dat ' which should have a single column containing the voltages measured in the experiment .",
    "the program scans the file , finds the data attributes ( number of data points , the maximum value in the data , the average voltage , etc . ) and writes them in the file ` cap1.out ' .",
