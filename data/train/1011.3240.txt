    "the experimental data unambiguosly tell us that the flavour structure of any model for new physics at the tev scale must be highly non - generic . in the context of low energy supersymmetry , after imposing the bounds from flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) the allowed portion of parameter space is so small that one usually refers to this fact as the supersymmetric flavour problem . among the various investigations which try to solve or at least alleviate the problem",
    ", many motivated proposals suggest that the ( s)particle spectrum may be hierarchical , with the sfermions of the first two generations much heavier than those of the third one @xcite-@xcite .",
    "very stringent bounds come from @xmath0 processes involved in @xmath3 and @xmath4 physics ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . for this reason , in order to make a comparison with data , it is important to resum the qcd corrections with the usual means of effective field theories .",
    "these corrections have already been computed @xcite-@xcite , however there is an effect which has been so far neglected although it can be important in the case of a large hierarchy .",
    "if one naively computes the relevant diagrams at leading order , then those involving both the heavy and the light squarks produce terms proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the two masses ( we assume that the various gauginos have typical mass close to that of the third generation ) .",
    "this is a clear signal that the diagram is sensitive to all the momenta between the two scales and thus that these logarithms can not be considered as initial conditions for the wilson coefficient at a given scale . on the other hand the diagrams involving only the heavy ( light ) squarks are only sensitive to the higher ( lower ) mass scale , and they do not exhibit such logarithms so that they can be treated in the standard way .",
    "this situation is somewhat analogous to what happens in the standard model when one has to deal with logarithms of @xmath5 @xcite . in that case in order to resum these logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory one has to consider the rg evolution , from @xmath6 down to @xmath7 , for the coefficients of all the relevant operators in the effective theory in which the @xmath8 boson and the top quark are integrated out .",
    "then at the charm threshold one can do the matching with the theory in which @xmath9 is integrated out too , so that at the end of the day one obtains rg improved wilson coefficients that multiply matrix elements which do not contain large logarithms .",
    "analogously in this context @xmath0 and several @xmath1 operators are generated at the high scale , which then mix through the exchange of third generation squarks .",
    "this produces final results that , at lowest order in the coupling constant , are equal to the naive logarithms one would find directly from the original diagrams .",
    "the difference is that now the qcd corrections have been properly included at leading order , with resummed large logarithms .",
    "a first step in this direction has already been made in @xcite , in which only the leading gluino diagrams are properly accounted for . in this paper",
    "we extend this treatment also to the other contributions involving weak interactions , for the case of @xmath3 physics .",
    "this work is structured as follows : in section [ sect : struct ] we specify our setup and recall basic facts about the amplitudes that we consider , in section [ sect : mix ] we study the flavour - violating mixing between the relevant operators , and finally in section [ sect : evol ] we present and discuss the results .",
    "in order to avoid unnecessary complications and focus on our issue , we consider the following setup :    1 .",
    "there is a hierarchy between the mass of the ( heavy ) squarks of the first two generations @xmath10 and that of the third one and the other light sparticles @xmath11 ; 2 .",
    "we are only interested in the @xmath0 contributions coming from the simultaneous exchange of both heavy and light squarks .",
    "for this reason we can totally neglect the higgs sector , which couples mainly to the third generation ; 3 .",
    "we neglect the mixing between lh and rh squarks as well as between gauginos ; 4 .",
    "we ignore the part of the lagrangian involving right handed down quarks .",
    "they can be included with the same procedure we outline below .",
    "we focus on the flavour violation in the down quark sector .    in conclusion , neglecting terms suppressed by the yukawa coupling of down - type quarks , we focus on the lagrangian : @xmath12 in which all the fields are mass eigenstates , and @xmath13 are unitary mixing matrices .",
    "the contribution to the effective lagrangian for @xmath0 processes due to the exchange of one heavy and one light squark is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16 operator : @xmath17 with @xmath18 colour indices and we focus on the @xmath19 case . for later convenience",
    "we define : @xmath20 where the roman index refers to the squarks and the greek indices to the quarks , that we are going to drop from now on .    naively computing the various box diagrams with one heavy squark with mass @xmath21 and one light squark with mass @xmath22 one",
    "obtains the qcd - uncorrected amplitude ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) : @xmath23 \\ ,   \\label{eq : naive}\\ ] ] where : @xmath24 we immediatly recognize the feature stressed in the introduction . in the case of large separation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "it is not consistent to use these expressions as initial condition for the coefficient of @xmath15 at the scale @xmath21 .",
    "we thus need a more careful treatment of the qcd running between the two scales , as we now discuss .",
    "the new ingredient that is required in order to deal with the heavy - light exchange in @xmath26 is the mixing between @xmath15 , given by ( [ q1 ] ) , and the @xmath27 operators which are generated after integrating out the heavy squarks of the first two generations ( see figure [ figure : diagrams ] ) .",
    "a possible basis for these operators , according to the external light particles , is :    * two gluinos : @xmath28 * one gluino and one neutralino : @xmath29\\\\ q_2^{g\\chi } & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_w}}\\ , \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ t^{b}_{\\beta \\alpha } ( \\overline{d}^\\beta p_r \\widetilde{g}^b)(\\overline{\\widetilde{b}}p_l s^\\alpha ) + ( \\widetilde{g}^b \\leftrightarrow \\widetilde{b } ) \\right ] \\",

    "notice the rescaling factors in the definition of the operators ( [ neutr : glu ] ) and ( [ neutr : charg ] ) , analogous to what done in @xcite@xcite",
    ". in the following we will keep @xmath37 constant and the adm at lowest order in @xmath38 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the appropriate effective lagrangian to work with is : @xmath39 it is convenient to define the scale - dependent 10-component vector @xmath40 satisfying an appropriate initial condition at @xmath41 , and a renormalization group equation ( rge ) : @xmath42 the @xmath43 matrix of anomalous dimensions , @xmath44 , receives contributions both from standard gluon exchanges as from flavour - changing light - squark exchanges .",
    "its explicit expression for a generic @xmath45 of colour is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the standard anomalous dimension of @xmath15 , while : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of light squarks ( @xmath54 if @xmath55 as we assume ; @xmath56 if also @xmath57 ) .",
    "an important observation is in order .",
    "as already stated we are interested only in the expression for @xmath58 at the light scale up to order @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "operators with four gaugino external legs and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . ] for this reason we do not care about the terms @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which introduce subleading corrections .",
    "notice that , besides all terms of the type @xmath65 , we are also obtaining _ some _ of the terms of the type @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in fact we obtain _ all _ such terms in the limit in which @xmath37 is left constant and we do not dress the various operators with genuine weak interactions .",
    "this means in particular that this procedure includes the relevant @xmath67 terms in the limit @xmath68 , in which they could dominate over the other contributions .",
    "it is also clear that all the entries of @xmath44 which are due to gluon exchange do not depend on the assumptions on the flavour structure , since flavour changing couplings enters only in the non - diagonal part of @xmath44 as well as in the initial conditions .",
    "to obtain @xmath58 one has first to evolve to the scale @xmath69 the coefficients of the @xmath1 operators , which is readily done by diagonalizing the @xmath70 matrix @xmath71 , via @xmath72 . in terms of @xmath73 and of the diagonal matrix @xmath74",
    ", one has : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the one loop coefficient of the beta - function for @xmath38 .",
    "the rge for @xmath34 has now the form : @xmath77 with @xmath78 given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : soldf1])-([eq : solchi ] ) .",
    "the analytic solution of this rge in our approximations is : @xmath79 \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\frac{\\xi_\\ell   \\hat{\\gamma}_{\\chi1 } \\hat{c}_{\\chi}(m_h)}{\\gamma_{\\chi\\chi}-\\gamma_1 - b_0 } \\left [    \\frac{1}{\\alpha_s(m_\\ell)}\\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_\\ell)}{\\alpha_s(m_h)}\\right)^{\\gamma_{\\chi\\chi}/b_0 }   -   \\frac{1}{\\alpha_s(m_h ) }   \\left (   \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_\\ell)}{\\alpha_s(m_h)}\\right)^{\\gamma_1/b_0 } \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the matrix elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath80 given by : @xmath81\\ ; , ~\\gamma_k = ( \\hat{\\gamma}^d_{gg})_{kk}. \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : soldf2 ] ) corresponds to the standard rescaling of @xmath15 , whereas the other terms , proportional to @xmath82 are the qcd corrected contribution appearing at lowest order in @xmath26 , eqs ( [ eq : l123 ] ) and ( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "the relevant initial conditions at the heavy scale are ( with @xmath83 ) : @xmath84\\ ] ] @xmath85 @xmath86 it is easy to see that expanding the full result up to order @xmath87 one obtains exactly the logarithms appearing in ( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "@xmath58 can then be evolved down to the gev scale in a standard way , properly accounting for the different thresholds one encounters in the beta - function coefficient .",
    "+ let us finally say something about the relative size of these corrections . consider the illustrative case @xmath88 gev and @xmath89 20 tev with @xmath90 .",
    "what one finds is that the relative correction to the wilson coefficient of @xmath15 , due to light - heavy exchange only , is respectively about @xmath91 for the terms proportional to @xmath92 , @xmath93 for those proportional to @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the terms proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "this is the correction with respect to using ( [ eq : naive ] ) as initial condition at @xmath21 and then naively evolve the coefficient with @xmath97 only ( as usually done in the literature @xcite-@xcite ) are considered . ] .",
    "if , on the contrary , the amplitude ( [ eq : naive ] ) were used as initial condition at the scale @xmath22 , then the relative errors would be respectively @xmath98 ( from @xmath92 ) , @xmath99 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath99 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "notice that , for moderate hierarchy , the relative impact of this correction is of the same order of what one typically obtains by computing the exact nlo corrections and then going to the hierarchical limit @xcite .",
    "in fact in that way one gets the correct result up to order @xmath100 , together with terms @xmath101 that are beyond our approximation .",
    "however if the logarithms are really large then it is necessary to completely resum them , as we did here for the lo result .",
    "the dominance of the corrections to the @xmath102 term reflects the fact that at one loop order the gluino - gluino exchanges give by themselves the @xmath103 of the total .",
    "this is the case if @xmath90 .",
    "notice however that , for @xmath104 , the proper corrections to the term @xmath105 can become important .",
