    "it is known that samples of ferroelectric single crystals often posses a surface layer whose properties differ from those of the bulk .",
    "it may be a layer produced during the growth of a crystalline plate or produced during the preparation of a plate - like sample .",
    "many observations gave evidence to the fact that such a layer is either nonferroelectric or does not take part in the switching process of the internal part ; in any case its permittivity is believed to differ from that of a homogeneous sample in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "its existence is expected to greatly influence macroscopic properties of bulk samples@xcite as well as of thin films.@xcite in this paper two such consequences are investigated .",
    "first we reconsider the problem of equilibrium domain structure in a ferroelectric sample possessing a surface layer , previously discussed by bjorkstam and oettel.@xcite second , we evaluate the restoring force acting on @xmath0 domain walls due to the layer ; this will make it possible to estimate the extrinsic contributions to permittivity , piezoelectric coefficients and elastic compliances of a ferroelectric sample .",
    "investigations of crystals of the kdp family revealed the existence of huge wall contributions to these properties.@xcite    in previous papers on a related subject@xcite , depolarizing field was considered as the source of energy which slows down the motion of a single domain wall in a dc electric field , as the wall departs from its original position by substantial distances .",
    "in contrast to such models we investigate very small deviations of walls forming a regular domain pattern .",
    "we consider a plate - like electroded sample of infinite area with major surfaces perpendicular to the ferroelectric axis @xmath1 .",
    "central ferroelectric part with antiparallel domains ( 2 . ) is separated from the electrodes ( 0 . ) , ( 4 . ) by nonferroelectric layers ( 1 . ) , ( 3 . )",
    "( see fig.[arta1:fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the electric field @xmath2 is determined by the applied potential difference @xmath3 and by the bound charge div@xmath4 on the boundary of ferroelectric material , where @xmath4 stands for spontaneous polarization .",
    "geometrical , electrical and material parameters of the system are shown in fig.[arta1:fig : geometry ] .",
    "we further introduce the symbols @xmath5 @xmath6 and several geometrical parameters : [ arta1:gpar ] @xmath7 the domain pattern factor @xmath8 and the asymmetry factor @xmath9    the ferroelectric material itself is approximated by the equation of state @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spontaneous polarization along the ferroelectric axis .",
    "this linear approximation limits the validity of our calculations to the temperature region not very close below the transition temperature @xmath12 .",
    "domain walls are assumed to have surface energy density @xmath13 and zero thickness .",
    "the gibbs electric energy of the system includes the domain wall energy , the electrostatic energy whose density is @xmath14 and the work performed by external electric sources @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the charge on positive electrode .",
    "first , laplace equations have to be solved for electric potentials in the bulk and in the surface layers , fulfilling the requirement of potential continuity as well as conditions of continuity of normal components of @xmath17 and tangential components of @xmath2 .",
    "a rather cumbersome calculation leads to the following formula for gibbs electric energy per unit area of the system ( in @xmath18 ) : @xmath19    the first term represents domain wall contribution while the last one is the depolarization energy .",
    "in the second term we recognize the effect of layers ( 1 . ) and ( 3 . ) and of the applied voltage .",
    "let us compare expression with formulae deduced and used in previous papers .",
    "for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the system goes over into an isolated ferroelectric plate with `` neutral '' domain structure , placed in vacuum . in this case the equation ( [ arta1:eq : depolenergy ] ) reduces to the expression given by kopal et al.@xcite for ferroelectric plates of finite thickness in which the interaction of the two surfaces is accounted for .",
    "if the plate is thick this interaction can be neglected and eq.([arta1:eq : depolenergy ] ) simplifies to the classical formula of mitsui and furuichi@xcite ( cf .",
    "eq.(9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is often used to determine the value @xmath13 from the observed width of domain patterns .",
    "finally , in the limit of @xmath20 our formula ( [ arta1:eq : depolenergy ] ) should converge to the expression deduced by bjorkstam and oettel.@xcite in fact this is not the case and it appears that the electric displacement as expressed in ref.@xcite does not satisfy all boundary conditions .",
    "at different values of potential difference @xmath25 and @xmath26.[arta1:fig : weqd],width=415 ]    if the system is short - circuited , the equilibrium domain pattern is symmetric , i.e. @xmath27 . the shape factor @xmath28 and from it also the value of @xmath29 can be found by numerical methods . as an example",
    ", the full lines in fig.[arta1:fig : weqd ] shows the @xmath30 dependence at constant @xmath31 and different values of potential difference @xmath25 .",
    "as it was shown in the previous paper@xcite , the critical thickness @xmath32 can be defined by the formula @xmath33 so that for @xmath34 the interaction energy of sample surfaces can be neglected .",
    "then the minimum energy occurs for @xmath35^{1/2}\\,\\sqrt{t } \\ .",
    "\\label{arta1:eq : w0}\\ ] ] and the dependence @xmath36 in this approximation is shown by a dashed line with @xmath24v in the fig.[arta1:fig : weqd ] .",
    "the approximate results in the fig.[arta1:fig : weqd ] with @xmath37v and @xmath38v are based on eqs.([arta1:eq : aeqv ] ) and ( [ arta1:eq : reqv ] ) . in these numerical calculations",
    "we have used the following values which roughly apply to crystals of @xmath39 below the transition temperature : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . the value @xmath44 is often considered typical for ferroelectrics .",
    "and @xmath45 at @xmath26 and @xmath46 .",
    "[ arta1:fig : weqv],width=415 ]    when an external potential difference @xmath25 is applied , the asymmetry parameter becomes nonzero and at the same time the period @xmath47 changes .",
    "both these quantities can be found again by determining the minimum of @xmath48 given by eq.([arta1:eq : depolenergy ] ) numerically .",
    "full lines in fig.[arta1:fig : weqv ] demonstrate both these dependencies for the following numerical values : @xmath49 , @xmath50 . starting from a certain applied voltage the domain spacing @xmath51 grows very fast with increasing @xmath25 . to discuss the macroscopic properties of the sample such as permittivity , the dependence @xmath45 is more important .",
    "we recognize that in a considerable region of the applied voltage this dependence is almost linear .",
    "the @xmath45 , @xmath52 resp .",
    "@xmath53 dependence can be approximated by an explicit formula if the following inequalities are satisfied : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then it holds @xmath57^{-1 }      \\label{arta1:eq : aeqv}\\ ] ] @xmath58 these approximations , shown in fig.[arta1:fig : weqv ] by dashed lines , are based on the limit of the sum in eq.([arta1:eq : depolenergy ] ) .",
    "the nonzero value of the asymmetry parameter means that an extra bound charge is deposited on the electrodes due to the domain wall shifts and this in turn represents an increase of effective permittivity of the whole system crystal plus both surface layers .",
    "the increase of the electrostatic energy when domain walls leave their original equilibrium positions for @xmath59 serves as the source of a restoring force when field is again reduced to zero .",
    "the calculations show that the effective permittivity @xmath60 defined by the total capacitance per unit area @xmath61 equals @xmath62      ^{-1 }      \\label{arta1:eq : eeff}\\ ] ] in this formula the first term on the right - hand side represents the intrinsic part of permittivity , given by linear dielectric response of the sample and of the surface layers when domain walls are kept at rest .",
    "the second term is the contribution of domain walls displacement to effective permittivity , often referred to as extrinsic part of permittivity .",
    "numerous data are available on domain wall contributions to permittivity in single crystals of ferroelectrics and also on extrinsic contributions to piezoelectric coefficients in ferroelectrics which are simultaneously ferroelastic .",
    "our calculations indicate that depolarizing energy can be an effective source of restoring force whose existence is a condition for such contributions .",
    "in fact since the model assumes a regular system of planar domain walls , it is suitable in particular for ferroelastic ferroelectrics such as crystals of the kdp family in which a dense pattern of @xmath0 domains is known to exist.@xcite it was found that in a wide temperature range below the curie point of crystals of @xmath63 and deuterated kdp , the piezoelectric coefficient @xmath64 is greatly enhanced compared to its expected value for single domain samples.@xcite recently , this was confirmed by simultaneous measurements of permittivity @xmath65 , elastic compliance @xmath66 and piezoelectric coefficient @xmath64 of @xmath39",
    ". a thorough discussion of @xmath64 in this case will be the subject of a forthcoming paper kopal _",
    "et al._. here we comment on the extrinsic part of @xmath65 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath67 .",
    "this is not an unreasonable assumption since the assumed surface layer for kdp - type samples can be supposed to have a similar chemical composition as the bulk .",
    "then the extrinsic part of eq.([arta1:eq : eeff ] ) reduces to @xmath68 numerically , the second term in the brackets represents a small correction to the first term when approximations ( [ arta1:eq : aeqv ] ) and ( [ arta1:eq : reqv ] ) are valid .",
    "if it is neglected , we obtain as an approximation @xmath69 this shows that a very thin surface layer can lead to a considerable extrinsic enhancement of permittivity . nevertheless , the simple implication : @xmath70 is not correct , because the assumptions needed for validity of ( [ arta1:eq : aeqv ] ) , ( [ arta1:eq : reqv ] ) , ( [ arta1:eq : eeff ] ) and ( [ arta1:eq : eextr ] ) are violated if @xmath71 is small enough .",
    "a more general formulation of the restoring force can be used to calculate the extrinsic part of @xmath64 for the same geometry of domains . in a recent paper@xcite sidorkin",
    "deduced the dispersion law of wall contributions to permittivity , however , in his treatment the existence of a surface layer is not explicitly considered .",
    "it was shown beyond any doubt that small motions of @xmath72 domain walls are responsible for a considerable enhancement of permittivity @xmath65 and piezoelectric coefficients @xmath73 in poled ferroelectric ceramics.@xcite one of the sources of the restoring force responsible for these wall contributions is the elastic energy at grain boundaries.@xcite since these boundaries may differ in chemical composition from the bulk of grains@xcite , surface layers can be expected to form so that the mechanism proposed in the present paper may also play a role in ceramic samples ."
