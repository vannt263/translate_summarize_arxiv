    "the energy loss of heavy quarks in qcd matter has excited considerable interest . in particular ,",
    "collisional energy loss in quark ",
    "gluon plasma has been evaluated @xcite by the methods of finite  temperature qcd ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "however , the energy loss of fast partons in medium is dominated by radiation of gluons @xcite and , to the best of our knowledge , a consistent treatment of radiative energy loss of heavy quarks in qcd matter is still lacking . practical importance of this issue has become clear from a number of studies @xcite which showed a strong dependence of charmed hadron and lepton spectra on the assumed heavy quark energy loss .    in this letter",
    "we follow the recent analysis of the quenching of inclusive particle spectra in qcd medium  @xcite to compare the yields of hadrons from light and heavy quarks produced in hard interactions in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we find that the specific pattern of gluon bremsstrahlung off heavy quarks ( the dead cone effect ) results in a much smaller heavy quark quenching , leading to a relative enhancement of heavy particle production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we first recall the basic features of gluon radiation caused by propagation of a fast parton ( quark ) through qcd medium .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , the accompanying radiation is determined by multiple rescattering of the radiated gluon in the medium .",
    "the gluon , during its formation time t_form , [ form ] accumulates a typical transverse momentum k_^2",
    "^2  t_form , [ walk ] with @xmath6 the mean free path and @xmath7 the characteristic momentum transfer squared in a single scattering .",
    "this is the random walk pattern with an average number of scatterings given by the ratio @xmath8 .    combining ( [ walk ] ) and ( [ form ] ) we obtain [ ncoh ] n_coh= = describing the number of scattering centres which participate , _ coherently _ , in the emission of the gluon with a given energy @xmath9 . for sufficiently large gluon energies , @xmath10 , when the coherent length exceeds the mean free path , @xmath11 . in this situation",
    "the standard bethe - heitler energy spectrum per unit length describing _ independent _ emission of gluons at each centre gets suppressed : [ spec ] = ( ) ^ 1n_coh = = . here",
    "@xmath12 is the `` colour charge '' of the parton projectile ( @xmath13 for the quark case we are interested in ) .    in",
    "we have substituted the characteristic ratio @xmath14 by the so - called gluon _ transport coefficient _ @xcite  q^2  dq^2 , [ qhat ] which is proportional to the density @xmath15 of the scattering centres in the medium and describes the typical momentum transfer in the gluon scattering off these centres .",
    "the transport coefficient for cold nuclear matter was expressed in @xcite as   [ xg(x , q^2 ) ] , [ qhatcold ] with @xmath16 the average nuclear density and @xmath17 $ ] the gluon density in a nucleon .",
    "the latter should be evaluated at the characteristic scale @xmath18 , which makes ( [ qhatcold ] ) , strictly speaking , an equation for @xmath19 . given a slow logarithmic @xmath20 dependence of the gluon density ,",
    "this equation can be solved iteratively .",

    "gluon plasma with @xmath27  mev resulted in the value of the gluon transport coefficient of about factor _",
    "twenty _ larger than : 0.2  gev^3 20 .",
    "[ qhathot ]    multiplying by the length @xmath28 of the medium traversed , we arrive at the following expression for the inclusive energy distribution of gluons radiated by a quark : [ omega1 ] , _ 1l^2 .",
    "a more accurate treatment shows that the semi - quantitative estimate is valid for @xmath29 , while at very large gluon energies @xmath30 the gluon yield is very small and decreases as @xmath31 ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the medium induced radiation vanishes for @xmath32 has a simple physical explanation , as according to the formation time of such gluons starts to exceed the length of the medium : @xmath33    another important feature of medium induced radiation is the relation between the transverse momentum and the energy of the emitted gluon .",
    "indeed , from and ( see also ) we derive k_^2 [ star ] .",
    "this means that the angular distribution of gluons with a given energy @xmath9 is concentrated at a characteristic energy- ( and medium- ) dependent emission angle [ angle ] ~()^1/4 .",
    "gluon bremsstrahlung off a heavy quark differs from the case of a massless parton ( produced in a process with the same hardness scale ) in one respect : gluon radiation is suppressed at angles smaller than the ratio of the quark mass @xmath34 to its energy @xmath35 . indeed",
    ", the distribution of soft gluons radiated by a heavy quark is given by dp =  c_f   d  k_^2 dk_^2 ( k_^2 + ^2 _ 0 ^ 2)^2 , _ 0 , [ dist ] where the strong coupling constant @xmath36 should be evaluated at the scale determined by the denominator of ( [ dist ] ) .",

    "= dp_0 ( 1+)^-2    this effect is known as the `` dead cone '' phenomenon .",
    "suppression of small - angle radiation has a number of interesting implications , such as perturbative calculability of ( and non - perturbative @xmath39 corrections to ) heavy quark fragmentation functions  @xcite , multiplicity and energy spectra of light particles accompanying hard production of a heavy quark  @xcite .    in the present context",
    "we should compare the angular distribution of gluons induced by the quark propagation in the medium with the size of the dead cone .",
    "to this end , for the sake of a semi - quantitative estimate , we substitute the characteristic angle into the dead cone suppression factor and combine it with the radiation spectrum to arrive at i ( ) = = _ s  c_f  1 ( 1 + ( ) ^3/2)^2 , [ eq : spechq ] where ^-1/3  ( m e)^4/3 . [ apar ] the suppression factor is displayed in fig .",

    "1= ^-1/3  ( m e)^4/3l^2 = ( ) ^4/3 , m. this shows that the quark mass becomes irrelevant when the quark energy exceeds the characteristic value @xmath43 which depends on the size of the medium and on its `` scattering power '' embodied into the value of the transport coefficient .",
    "which regime is realized in the experiments on heavy quark production in nuclear collisions ?",
    "taking @xmath44 for charm quarks and using the values and we estimate @xmath45 for the cold and hot matter , respectively .",
    "we observe that for the transverse momentum ( energy ) distributions of heavy mesons the inequality @xmath46 always holds in practice , especially for the hot medium .",
    "we thus conclude that the pattern of medium induced gluon radiation appears to be _ qualitatively different for heavy and light quarks _ in the kinematical region of practical interest .",
    "the issue of in - medium quenching of inclusive particle spectra was recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 spectrum is given by the convolution of the transverse momentum distribution in an elementary hadron ",
    "hadron collision , evaluated at a shifted value @xmath47 , with the distribution @xmath48 in the energy @xmath49 lost by the quark to the medium - induced gluon radiation : = d  d ( )   d ^vac d p_^2 ( p _ + ) ( p _ ) q(p _ ) , [ defpt ] with @xmath50 the medium dependent _ quenching factor_. the two facts , namely that in the essential region @xmath51 and that the vacuum cross section is a steeply falling function , allow one to simplify the calculation of the quenching factor @xmath52 by adopting the exponential approximation for the @xmath49-integral in : [ qfint ] q(p _ ) d  d ( )  \\ { } , .",
    "this integral results in the _ mellin moment _ of the quark distribution , [ qexp ] q(p_)= ( ) = , = , [ tildf ] where @xmath53 is the _ integrated gluon multiplicity _ defined according to ( see @xcite for details ) n ( ) _ ^ d d w (  ) d . [ intm ] here we present an approximate evaluation based on a simplified energy spectrum ( [ eq : spechq ] ) .",
    "integration of ( [ eq : spechq ] ) leads to the following expression for the gluon multiplicity ( [ intm ] ) : n ( ) = 2 _ s  c_f  k ( ) , where the function @xmath54 has essential support in the region @xmath55 , that is where the gluon yield is not suppressed by the quark mass ( dead cone ) effect ( cf .  ) . to find the quenching factor we need to evaluate its mellin transform according to ( [ qexp ] ) , with @xmath56 given in ( [ ftp ] ) .",
    "the essential energies @xmath9 in the multiplicity function in are then restricted to @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to check that , due to the bias effect ( large value of @xmath58 ) , this restriction is stronger than the quark mass energy cutoff : = ^1/3()^4/3 ( ) ^1/3 > 2 for @xmath59  gev , even for cold matter .",
    "therefore , in this practically interesting domain , we can approximate n ( )   ( 1 - 8 9 ) , [ approx ] and get ( ) . the use of ( [ qexp ] ) furnishes our final result : q_h(p _ ) .",

    "the second term is specific for heavy quarks .",
    "it has a positive sign , which means that the suppression of the heavy hadron @xmath25 distributions is always smaller than that for the light hadrons .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the fact that the heavy quark mass suppresses gluon radiation . at",
    "very high transverse momenta , both terms vanish  this is in accord with the qcd factorization theorem , stating that the effects of the medium should disappear as @xmath62 .",
    "how fast this regime is approached depends , however , on the properties of the medium encoded in the value of the transport coefficient @xmath19 and in the medium size @xmath28 .",
    "constructing the ratio of the quenching functions , we estimate the heavy - to - light enhancement factor as @xmath63 .",
    "\\label{eq : ratio}\\ ] ] this simple expression provides a reasonably good approximation to more accurate quantitative results presented below .",
    "to perform a quantitative calculation of the transverse momentum distributions , our considerations have to be combined with a realistic treatment of nuclear geometry , including its centrality dependence , gluon multiple interactions in the initial state ( the `` cronin effect '' ) , and a model for the time evolution of qcd matter in the final state .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , we provide some semi - quantitative illustrations of the expected consequences of our results , based on a simplified model of a static uniform medium and a fixed quark path length @xmath28 .    in",
    "what follows we use the full inclusive soft gluon emission spectrum off a massless quark from @xcite , taking into account the first non - soft correction @xmath64 : @xmath65 which , for the heavy quark case , is supplied with the dead - cone suppression factor . to illustrate the `` dead cone '' effect , in fig .",
    "[ didom ] a comparison of the inclusive one - gluon emission spectra off light and charm quarks is shown , for hot medium with @xmath66 .    as we have discussed above ,",
    "the quenching of @xmath25 distributions of heavy hadrons caused by qcd matter is much weaker than for pions .",
    "this is because the gluon cloud around the heavy quark is `` truncated '' by the large quark mass , in a way which depends on the properties of the medium .",
    "this interesting effect can be illustrated by the transverse momentum dependence of the ratio of hadrons originating from the fragmentation of heavy and light quarks ( for example , @xmath0 ratio ) in heavy ion collisions .",
    "to estimate this ratio we need to know the behaviour of the vacuum spectra . for _ light _ hadrons ( which we assume to originate from light quarks in the exponent ] ) the parameterization of the @xmath25 distribution which describes the first rhic hadroproduction data for @xmath25 up to @xmath67  gev  @xcite : = a  ( 1 p_0 + p_)^m , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "[ fcold ] shows the ratio of quenching factors ( [ finres ] ) for heavy and light quarks in cold nuclear matter ( @xmath66 ) , which is relevant for large-@xmath74 particle production in @xmath75 collisions .",
    "a small value of the transport coefficient , @xmath76 , translates into a @xmath77 15% enhancement of the heavy - to - light ratio ( about 1%  for @xmath78 ) .    according to",
    ", we expect a larger quenching ratio for a hot medium .",
    "indeed , as fig .",
    "[ fhot ] demonstrates , the @xmath0 ratio should become significantly enhanced as compared to @xmath79 collisions : assuming a fixed length @xmath66 of the hot medium traversed by the quarks , we find a factor of @xmath80 enhancement at @xmath81 .",
    "we only present the _ ratio _ of quenching factors for the following reason . as noticed in @xcite , in the region of transverse momenta",
    "we are considering , the _ absolute _ magnitude of quenching turns out to be extremely sensitive to gluon radiation in the few - hundred-@xmath82 energy range and therefore can not be quantitatively predicted without detailed understanding of the spectral properties of the medium .",
    "the heavy - to - light ratio , however , proves to be much less sensitive to the infrared region , since gluon radiation off heavy and light quarks is universal in the @xmath83 limit , see . to illustrate this point , in fig .",
    "[ fhot ] we show the ratio of quenching factors calculated with the energy restriction upon gluon energies , @xmath84 .",
    "we see that in the @xmath85 range of @xmath74 , this modifies the ratio by @xmath86  % .",
    "is vetoed . ]",
    "the predicted ratio should not be taken at its face value : the enhancement factor originates mainly from a very strong quenching of light quark jets , and in reality such a dramatic suppression will be washed out by light - particle production at the _ periphery _ of the collision zone . in a central @xmath87 collision , the number of collisions in this peripheral zone , depending on the strength of absorption , scales as @xmath88 , whereas the total number of collisions which contribute to the production of @xmath70 mesons scales as @xmath89 .",
    "thus , even with account of the collision geometry , we may still expect an order of @xmath90 enhancement of the @xmath0 ratio , which for a @xmath91 collision may translate in a strong effect .",
    "moreover , given a large nucleus and moderately large @xmath74 , both light and ( especially ) heavy quarks will be tempted to turn into hadrons _",
    "prior _ to leaving the interaction arena . in the pion case",
    ", this is likely to add to quenching via pion absorption in the medium  @xcite , thus enhancing further the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "clearly , detailed calculations have to be performed before a defendable number for the magnitude of the @xmath0 enhancement can be presented .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0 ratio appears to be extremely sensitive to the density of colour charges in qcd matter , and we eagerly await the results of experimental studies of this quantity in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
