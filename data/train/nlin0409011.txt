    "there are several reports for observation of scarred lasing modes in various microcavities whose patterns show enhanced field intensity along an unstable periodic orbit of the cavity@xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the inherent properties of the dielectric cavities , the existence of quasi - scarred resonance modes@xcite , which are not supported by any unstable periodic orbit , are suggested and numerically confirmed in a spiral - shaped dielectric microdisk . in a nonlinear dynamical model of a stadium - shaped cavity with an active medium , harayama",

    "in this paper we study resonances of the stadium - shaped microcavity by using the boundary element method ( bem)@xcite .",
    "we present the whole resonances in the range of @xmath6 with the refractive index @xmath7 to show what resonance patterns are possible to appear as lasing modes and to find the relationships between @xmath4 factor and resonance pattern .",
    "we note that the classical dynamics of the stadium - shaped billiard is chaotic .",
    "this means that the resonances can not be classified by mode indices , similar to the absence of good quantum number in quantum mechanical problem . in spite of its chaotic ray dynamical properties ,",
    "we find that the high @xmath4 modes in this @xmath8 range have special patterns which can be classified from other modes , and these modes are really excited with low pumping rate in the nonlinear dynamical model developed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[bem ] we summarize the bem used to obtain resonances numerically , and the resulting resonances are presented and discussed in sec.[resonances ] . in sec.[patternchange ] the variations of the resonance position and pattern with the refractive index @xmath1 are discussed .",
    "we confirm , in sec.[nonlinear ] , the fact that the high @xmath4 resonances are the stationary modes with low pumping rate in the nonlinear dynamical model , and a ray dynamical consideration for the high @xmath4 resonance patterns is given in sec.[raydynamics ] .",

    "in this section we briefly describe the boundary element method ( bem)@xcite which is effective when the boundary is strongly deformed from a circular shape . in the microdisk case",
    ", maxwell s equations can be reduced to a two - dimensional helmholtz equation @xmath9 the main idea of bem is to replace the helmholtz equation by one - dimensional boundary equations and then to discretize the boundaries . to obtain the one - dimensional boundary equation , the green function ,",
    "the solution of the helmholtz equation with a delta function source , and green s identity are used . the green function for the helmholtz equation",

    "the boundary is a simple stadium shape , we can therefore make , by locating @xmath14 on the boundary , two boundary equations corresponding to the inside and outside of the microdisk , respectively .",
    "discretization of the two boundary equations leads to a matrix equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are column vectors composed by the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the element points on the boundary .",
    "the non - trivial solution of this matrix equation exists only when the determinant of @xmath24 is zero , which is the condition used in determining the complex wavenumber @xmath2 of resonances .",
    "note that hankel functions in the green function and its normal derivative are singular at the origin , so a careful treatment is needed to overcome this sigularities .",
    "the sigularity of @xmath25 in @xmath26 can be compensated by a geometrical factor , and the corresponding diagonal terms can be expressed in terms of the curvature @xmath27 of the boundary . in order to treat the sigularity of @xmath28 in @xmath29",
    ", we use the asymptotic expression of @xmath28 and integrate it in the related elements@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on tm polarization where both the wavefunction @xmath22 and its normal derivative @xmath23 are continuous across the boundary , and the @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath30-component of electric field @xmath31 when the disk lies on @xmath32-@xmath33 plane . in the case of te polariztion",

    "this boundary condition can be incorporated into the above formalism by a slight correction . in practical calculations",
    "we take into consideration of the symmetry of the stadium - shaped microcavity , i.e. , stadium has symmetries about the @xmath32- and @xmath33-axes .",
    "the symmetry consideration leads to the reduction of computing time by allowing to treat only quarter part of the stadium boundary .",
    "instead we have to use the desymmetrized green function when constructing the matrix equation eq.([mateq ] ) .",
    "generally the space between element points can be taken as a variable of the curvature , i.e. , if the curvature is large , then take a large number of points .",
    "the stadium - shaped boundary is , however , simple enough to take equal spacing points . in the practical calculation we take 50 elements on the quarter part of the boundary , which corresponds to about 12 element per a wavelength(@xmath36 ) .",
    "fig.1 shows the convergence of the complex @xmath2 value of the resonance @xmath37 ( see fig.2 ) with the number of elements @xmath38 in the quarter part of the boundary .",
    "the values at @xmath39 gives an error less than 0.2 % from the limit values .",
    "we find 33 resonances in the range @xmath40 with @xmath7 . the number of resonances in this range can be inferred from the modified weyl s theorem@xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the area",

    "we find 7 ( odd - odd ) , 8 ( odd - even ) , 8 ( even - odd ) , and 10 ( even - even ) resonances , respectively",
    ". the smaller number of resonances for the odd - odd symmetry case and the larger number for the even - even symmetry case , can be understood by eq.([weyl ] ) , since the former is close to the dirichlet boundary condition and the latter is close to the neumann boundary condition .    , @xmath47 ( b ) @xmath48 , @xmath49 + ( c ) @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( d ) @xmath52 , @xmath53 + ( e ) @xmath37 , @xmath54 ( f ) @xmath55 , @xmath56 + ( g ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , width=283,height=377 ]    the relation between @xmath4 factor and the complex wavenumber @xmath2 is given by @xmath59}{2 \\mbox{im}[kr]}.\\ ] ] therefore , the smaller absolute value of imaginary part of @xmath2 means the higher @xmath4 modes .",

    "it is obvious that these resonances can be classified as one class of pattern by observing the distribution of high intensity field near the boundary and same directionality of near field emission .",
    "the only difference between them is the number of intensity spots along the boundary .",
    "this fact can be illustrated by almost constant difference of @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath99 between adjacent two modes among these is about 0.34 .",

    ", we can confirm that these modes can be classified as a class .",

    "therefore , the high intensity on the central part of the cavity in the latter high @xmath4 modes ( @xmath100 , @xmath83 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) means that rays supporting those modes are different from those for the wg type resonances , and they would pass the central part of the cavity . the ray dynamical consideration for the high @xmath4 modes would be presented in sec.[raydynamics ] .",

    "as discussed before , the high @xmath4 modes ( low value of @xmath126 ) show localized patterns near the boundary or the center of the stadium - shaped microdisk cavity .",

( a),(b ) ) show good directional emission at about @xmath127 from the @xmath128axis in the far field distribution , while the high @xmath4 modes in the odd - even and even - even symmetry classes ( fig.5 ( a),(b ) and fig.6 ( a),(b ) ) have oscillatory far field distributions implying several emitting beams over rather wide angle range .    .",

    "in this section we study the pattern change of resonances with varying refractive index @xmath1 .",
    "sometimes it seems to be accepted as a general concept that the high refractive index limit ( @xmath130 ) in microcavity would be equivalent to the infinite wall case ( usual billiard systems ) .",
    "this might be based on the following reasoning .",
    "since in higher @xmath1 case the critical angle for total internal reflection is very small , and approaches to zero in the limit , rays are confined in the cavity by the total internal reflections .",
    "this situation is very similar to the infinite wall case .",
    "one would , therefore , expect that patterns of eigenfunctions of the infinite wall case would represent the limiting ( @xmath130 ) patterns of resonances .    here",
    "we examine this expectation by observing changes of the complex wavenumber @xmath2 and resonance pattern with increasing the refractive index @xmath1 inside the cavity and by comparing the limit values with the eigenvalues of the infinite wall case . in order to keep the number of intensity spots in resonance patterns",

    "the @xmath61 converges to about @xmath132 and the @xmath62 seems to approach zero as @xmath1 increases .",
    "in fact , it is very difficult to say definitely if the @xmath62 become zero at the limit or not , due to the numerical error in bem .",
    "the inset in fig.7 ( b ) shows the saturation behavior to a nonzero value of @xmath62 when @xmath39 , but if we increase the number of elements , the saturation value gets closer to the real axis with a convergence slower than logarithmic one .",
    "we also calculate eigenvalues of the stadium billiard in the concerned range which are @xmath133 .",
    "we note that any of them does not coincide with the limiting value @xmath132 , which mean that , although the imaginary part of the wavenumber @xmath5 gets closer to real axis , the resonance never approaches an eigenmode of the infinite wall case .",
    "this result can be understood in terms of the evanescent effect , i.e. , tunneling effect , in the dielectric microcavity system . in the infinite wall case ,",
    "the evanescent effect is not allowed by the dirichlet boundary condition , and no amplitude outside the boundary .",
    "although the classical dynamics is similar , the evanescent effect can appear in the microcavity case , because rays can exist outside as well as inside the cavity .",
    "the same argument is availible for the wgm in which the small emission from the cavity is the result of the evanescent effect . from this reasoning",
    "we guess that there would be very small nonzero limiting value of @xmath62 due to the evanescent effect .    the resonance pattern with @xmath134",
    ", @xmath135 is the refractive index outside the cavity ( @xmath136 in our case ) , is shown in fig.7 ( c ) .",
    "the pattern inside the cavity has no crucial difference from the @xmath7 case when compared to fig.1 ( a ) , and the emission pattern outside the cavity is drastically reduced , reflecting the strong ray confinement .",
    "this behavior is also true for other resonances , and the limiting pattern of @xmath52 is also shown in fig.7 ( d ) .",
    "conceptually , a dynamical description of the microdisk laser is the same as that of any other type of laser : it should include equations for material polarization and inversion of the active medium and equations for electromagnetic field . of these equations ,",
    "only the field equations require a special treatment in the case of the microdisk laser .",
    "the main difficulty is that an analytical description of resonant mode functions , their frequencies and linewidths is generally impossible .",
    "even if all these data are known from independent calculations , for example , obtained by using bem as in previous chapters , it is not obvious which of these modes should be included into the model to incorporate the main features of the microdisk laser dynamics .",
    "one can , of course , include into the model all the resonances whose frequencies fall into the positive gain range of the active medium .",
    "however , such an approach can encounter numerical problems , especially for sufficiently large cavities and wide spectral contour gain .",

    ", height=283 ]    an alternative approach to the problem was proposed by harayama et al.@xcite .",
    "they developed a model for the microdisk laser and called it `` schrodinger- bloch model '' . in their derivation of the schrodinger - bloch model equations the authors made an approximation , replacing the space - dependent refractive index in some expression by a constant value .",
    "using this model harayama at al . have found that lasing patterns obtained are in a very good agreement with the bem results .",
    "however , the authors did not discuss the question , why the effect of the refractive index replacement , made to derive the schrodinger- bloch model equations , is as minor .",
    "our results presented in sec.[patternchange ] , allow us to clarify this question . actually , the replacement mentioned above is equivalent , in a sense , to the refractive index change described in sec.[patternchange ] .",
    "fig.7 shows clearly that the pattern and the wavelength location of the resonance do not change significantly with refractive index .",
    "however , the situation is quite different for the width of the resonance , i.e. for the mode damping : it is highly sensitive to refractive index variations .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that of conventional fabry perot resonator@xcite , for which mode frequencies are determined by its length and mode damping - by the reflectivity of mirrors .",
    "so , we believe that the accuracy of the threshold characteristics obtained using the schrodinger - bloch model are not of high accuracy . however , we believe that the relative positions of resonances shown in fig.2 do not change .",
    "keeping this discussion in mind , we use the schrodinger - bloch model to simulate the stadium - shaped microdisk laser in the oscillating regime .",

    "the transition dipole matrix element @xmath147 corresponds to semiconductor quantum well structures .",
    "a typical value for the excited state relaxation time for semiconductors is @xmath148 , but we used in simulations ten or more times lower values",
    ". we can get various stationary lasing modes whose basic patterns can be found in the resonance patterns presented in fig.3 - 6 . the stationary lasing modes with low pumping rates are shown in fig.8 .",
    "when the gain profile is centered on @xmath145 , the resonance mode @xmath100 is excited as the lasing mode . as shown in fig.2 ,",
    "it is consistent with the fact that the highest @xmath4 mode near @xmath145 is the mode @xmath100 .",
    "the same argument is valid for other cases , i.e. , when the position of the gain profile are @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the stationary lasing modes are the high @xmath4 resonance modes , @xmath101 , @xmath68 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the asymmetric lasing mode shown in fig.8 ( c ) can arise from the multimode lasing with different symmetry classes , i.e. , the resonance modes @xmath97 and @xmath83 .",
    "the direction of asymmetric emission oscillates , upwards and downwards alternately .",
    "we can expect if the pumping rate increase , this multimodes operation becomes single mode operation resulted from the locking process@xcite .    from the above calculation for the active microcavity",
    ", we can see that the interaction between field and active medium does not give any substantial pattern change from the resonance patterns of the passive micocavity .",
    "this result means that the anlysis of the resonance patterns of the passive microcavity shown in sec.[resonances ] would play an essential role in understanding the lasing modes from the active microcavity .",
    "it is well known that the stadium system is classically chaotic , so there is no special structure in the portrait of the poincar surface of section , showing just chaotic sea over the whole phase space . however , in the dielectric cavity case rays can escape the cavity . the path length before the escape should depend on the initial point in the phase space , and we can obtain some structure related to the path length in the phase space .    from the fact that the wgm of very high @xmath4 factor in the circular disk are supported by the rays surviving infinitely through the total internal reflection , we can expect that the high @xmath4 modes would be supported by the rays with long path length before the escaping by refraction .",
    "we select 50 initial points from which the generated ray trajectories have long path length , @xmath151 , when @xmath152 , before escaping .",
    "the trajectories starting from the 50 initial points are shown in fig.9 .",
    "we can see that the trajectories with long path length pass near the boundary and the center of the stadium which coincide with the high intensity regions in the high @xmath4 resonances .",
    "similarly , the low @xmath4 resonance modes of bouncing ball type are supported by the rays with short path length before escaping .",
    "more generally , we can consider some distributions over the phase space to characterize the ray dynamical behavior in microcavities , e.g. , the path length distribution @xmath153 and the survival probability distribution @xmath154 . the path length distribution @xmath153 can be given by the characteristic length of the trajectory starting from an initial point @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , if the initial point is on a periodic orbit @xmath156 and the absolute values of associated @xmath157 values are greater than the critical value @xmath158 of the total internal reflection , the value of @xmath159 becomes infinity .",
    "since the trajectoris starting from the initial points near the stable manifold around the periodic orbit would have long characteristic lengths , the structure of @xmath159 would follow the structure of the stable manifold . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider an ensemble of uniform initial points over the whole phase space , we can trace the flow of the points in the phase space and after long time due to energy escape by emission the points with lower weight are redistributed , and as a result a steady probability distribution can be achieved .",
    "this steady probability distribution can be approximated by the normalized survival probability distriubtion @xmath154 at a long time@xcite .",
    "this distribution would be closely related to the high @xmath4 resonance patterns and have the structure of unstable manifolds .",
    "using the bem , we obtained all resonances in the range of @xmath160 for the stadium - shaped microdisk , and investigated the patterns of high @xmath4 resonances for four different symmetry classes . the high @xmath4 resonances show high intensity distribution near the boundary and central part of the cavity , which is consistent with the classical ray consideration .",
    "the relationship between @xmath4 value and resonance pattern was discussed , and the resonances could be classified by the difference of the patterns even though the classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "we also confirmed that the stationary lasing modes with low pumping rate in the nonlinear dynamical model are the high @xmath4 modes . from this resonance pattern analysis ,",
    "we can expect which type of pattern can be excited as a stationary lasing mode .",

    "<S> we investigate resonance patterns in a stadium - shaped microcavity around @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the refractive index , @xmath2 the vacuum wavenumber , and @xmath3 the radius of the circular part of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the patterns of high @xmath4 resonances can be classified , even though the classical dynamics of the stadium system is chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns of the high @xmath4 resonances are consistent with the ray dynamical consideration , and appears as the stationary lasing modes with low pumping rate in the nonlinear dynamical model . </S>",
    "<S> all resonance patterns are presented in a finite range of @xmath5 . </S>"
