    "in this paper , we will make use of a series of six continuum 3.6 cm ( 8.42 ghz ) observations of hubble 4 and hde  283572 obtained roughly every three months between september 2004 and december 2005 with the vlba ( tab .  1 ) .",

    "each observation consisted of series of cycles with two minutes on source , and one minute on the main phase - referencing quasar j0429 + 2724 ( the same for both targets ) .",
    "each 24 minutes , we also observed three secondary calibrators ( j0433 + 2905 , j0408 + 3032 , and j0403 + 2600 ) forming a triangle around the astronomical source ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "all four calibrators are very compact extragalactic sources whose absolute positions are known to better than 1 milli - arcsecond ( beasley et al.2002 ) .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated using the astronomical image processing system ( aips greisen 2003 ) .",
    "the basic data reduction followed the standard vlba procedures for phase - referenced observations .",
    "first , the most accurate measured earth orientation parameters obtained from the us naval observatory database were applied to the data to improve the values initially used by the vlba correlator .",
    "second , dispersive delays caused by free electrons in the earth s atmosphere were accounted for using estimates of the electron content of the ionosphere derived from global positioning system ( gps ) measurements . _ a priori _ amplitude calibration based on the measured system temperatures and standard gain curves was then applied .",
    "the fourth step was to correct the phases for antenna parallactic angle effects , and the fifth was to remove residual instrumental delays caused by the vlba electronics .",
    "this was done by measuring the delays and phase residuals for each antenna and if using the fringes obtained on a strong calibrator .",
    "the final step of this initial calibration was to remove global frequency- and time - dependent phase errors using a global fringe fitting procedure on the main phase calibrator ( j0429 + 2724 ) , which was assumed at this stage to be a point source .    in this initial calibration , the solutions from the global fringe fit",
    "were only applied to the main phase calibrator itself .",
    "the corresponding calibrated visibilities were then imaged , and several passes of self- calibration were performed to improve the overall amplitude and phase calibration . in the image obtained after the self - calibration iterations , the main phase calibrator is found to be slightly extended .",
    "to take this into account , the final global fringe fitting part of the reduction was repeated using the image of the main phase calibrator as a model instead of assuming it to be a point source .",
    "note that a different phase calibrator model was produced for each epoch to account for possible small changes in the main calibrator structure from epoch to epoch .",
    "the solutions obtained after repeating this final step were edited for bad points and applied to the astronomical targets and to the main and secondary calibrators .",
    "the astrometry precision of vlbi observations such as those presented here , depends critically on the quality of the phase calibration .",
    "systematic errors , unremoved by the standard calibration procedures described above , usually dominate the phase calibration error budget , and limit the astrometric precision achieved to several times the value expected theoretically ( e.g.  fomalont 1999 , pradel et al",
    ".  2006 ) .",
    "at the frequency of the present observations , the main sources of systematic errors are inaccuracies in the troposphere model used , as well as clock , antenna and _ a priori _ source position errors .",
    "these effects combine to produce a systematic phase difference between the calibrator and the target , causing position shifts . one effective strategy to measure and correct these systematic errors consists of including observations of more than one phase calibrator chosen to surround the target ( fomalont & kogan 2005 ) .",
    "this allows phase gradients around the source due to errors in the troposphere model or related to uncertainties in the cataloged position of the calibrators , to be measured and corrected .",
    "this strategy was applied to our observations using the three secondary calibrators mentioned earlier ( fig .  1 ) , and resulted in significant improvements in the final phase calibration and image quality .",
    "because of the time spent on the calibrators , only about 5 of the 9 hours of telescope time allocated to each of our observations were actually spent on source .",
    "once calibrated , the visibilities were imaged with a pixel size of 50 @xmath57as after weights intermediate between natural and uniform ( robust = 0 in aips ) were applied .",
    "this resulted in typical r.m.s .",
    "noise levels of 5080@xmath57jy beam@xmath58 ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "both sources were detected with a signal to noise ratio better than 10 at each epoch ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "the source absolute positions at each epoch ( also listed in tab .",
    "1 ) were determined using a 2d gaussian fitting procedure ( task jmfit in aips ) .",
    "this task provides an estimate of the position error ( columns 3 and 5 of tab .",
    "1 ) based on the expected theoretical astrometric precision of an interferometer :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the wavelength , @xmath61 the baseline , and @xmath62 the image signal - to - noise ratio ( thompson et al .  1986 ) . in spite of the extra calibration steps taken to improve the phase calibration ,",
    "uncorrected systematic errors still exist , and must be added quadratically to the values deduced from eq .  1 .",
    "these remaining systematic errors are difficult to estimate _ a priori _ , and may depend on the structure of the source under consideration . here",
    ", we will estimate these systematic effects from the fits to the data ( see below ) .",
    "the displacement of the sources on the celestial sphere is the combination of their trigonometric parallax ( @xmath63 ) and proper motions ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the reference epoch was taken at the mean epoch of each series of observations : jd 24353500 ( @xmath64 2005.355 ) for bothy sources . since the sources considered here appear to be isolated , we considered linear and uniform proper motions .",
    "the astrometric parameters were calculated using the svd - decomposition fitting scheme described by loinard et al .",
    "the necessary barycentric coordinates of the earth , as well as the julian date of each observation were calculated using the multi - year interactive computer almanac ( mica ) distributed as a cdrom by the us naval observatory . they are given explicitly in tab .  2 for all epochs and sources . the best fits give the following parameters :    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    for hubble 4 and hde  283572 , respectively .",
    "the measured parallaxes correspond to distances of 132.8 @xmath0 0.5 pc for hubble 4 , and 128.5 @xmath0 0.6 pc for hde  283572 .",
    "the post - fit rms ( dominated by the remaining systematic errors mentioned at the end of sect .",
    "2 ) is quite good for hde  283572 : 60 @xmath57as and 90 @xmath57as in right ascension and declination , respectively . for hubble 4 , on the other hand",
    ", the residual is good in right ascension ( 40 @xmath57as ) , but large in declination ( 240 @xmath57as ) . to obtain a reduced @xmath67 of one both in right ascension and declination",
    ", one must add quadratically 3.1 microseconds of time and 340 microseconds of arc to the formal errors delivered by jmfit for hubble 4 , and 4.3 microseconds of time and 115 microseconds of arc for hde  283572 .",
    "all the errors quoted in the paper include these systematic contributions .",
    "the origin of the large declination residual for hubble 4 ( which does not affect strongly the parallax determination , because the latter is dominated by the right ascension measurements ) is not entirely clear .",
    "the fact that the residual is only ( or , at least , mostly ) detected in declination ( fig .  3 ) would suggest a calibration issue .",
    "indeed , astrometric fitting of phase - referenced vlbi observations is usually worse in declination than in right ascension ( e.g.  fig .  1 in chatterjee et al .",
    "2004 ) as a result of residual zenith phase delay errors ( reid et al .",
    "we consider this possibility fairly unlikely here , however , because such a problem would have been detected during the multi - source calibration , and because the observations and reduction of hubble 4 and hde  283572 ( which does not appear to be affected by any calibration issue ) were performed following identical protocols and over the same period of time .",
    "another element that argues against a calibration problem is that the large residual is not the result of one particularly discrepant observation : in addition to the fit mentioned above where all 6 observations of hubble 4 are taken into account , we made 5 fits where we sequentially discarded one of the epochs .",
    "all 5 fits gave similar astrometric parameters , and a similarly large declination residual .",
    "thus , we argue that this large residual might be real , rather than related to a calibration problem . at the distance of hubble 4 , 240 @xmath57as",
    "correspond to 0.032 au , or about 7 r@xmath68 .",
    "hubble 4 is estimated to have a radius of about 3.4 r@xmath68  ( johns - krull et al .",
    "2004 ) , so the amplitude of the residual is just about 2 @xmath69 .",
    "baring this figure in mind , at least two mechanisms could potentially explain the large declination residual : ( i ) the magnetosphere of hubble 4 could be somewhat more extended than its photosphere , and the residuals could reflect variations in the structure of the magnetosphere ; ( ii ) hubble 4 could have a companion , and the residuals could reflect the corresponding reflex motion .",
    "let us examine the pros and cons of these two possibilities .",
    "if the residuals were related to a variable extended magnetosphere , one would expect the emission to be occasionally somewhat extended .",
    "interestingly , phillips et al .",
    "( 1991 ) reported that hubble 4 was slightly resolved in their vlbi data , and we find it to be resolved also in at least two of our own observations . on the other hand , if the emission were related to variations in the magnetosphere , one would expect to see variations with the periodicity of the rotational period of the star ( about 12/sin_i _",
    "days johns - krull et al.2004 ) . given that the separation between our successive observations is typically three months , we would expect the residuals to be essentially random .",
    "instead , those residuals seem to show a periodicity of about 1.2 years ( fig .  3b )",
    ". this would be more consistent with our alternative proposal that the residuals be related to the reflex motion of hubble 4 due to the presence of an unseen companion .",
    "the semi - major axis corresponding to a period of 1.2 yr and a mass of 0.7 m@xmath68  ( see below ) is just about 1 au . since the ratio between the amplitude of the reflex motion and that of the orbital path is the inverse of the ratio between the mass of the primary and that of the companion , the mass of the companion would have to be 0.7(0.032/1 ) = 0.02 m@xmath68 .",
    "the companion would then have to be a very low - mass star , or a brown dwarf .",
    "note , however , that the residuals are relatively poorly constrained with the existing data , and that additional observations aimed in particular at confirming the periodicity in the residuals will be needed to resolve this issue .",
    "hde  283572 was one of the few taurus members with a parallax estimate from hipparcos ( @xmath63 = 7.81 @xmath0 1.30 mas ; @xmath70 = 128@xmath71 pc ; bertout et al .",
    "the present determination is well within 1@xmath72 of the hipparcos value , but more that one order of magnitude more precise .",

    "again , our values are within 1@xmath72 of these determinations , but more than one order of magnitude more precise .",

    "coordinates provided by the vlba ) , we use u@xmath79 ; = + 9.0 , v@xmath79 ; = + 12.0 , and w@xmath79 ; = + 7.0 km s@xmath58 ( allen 2000 ) . here , we follow the traditional convention where u runs from the sun to the galactic center , v is in the galactic plane , perpendicular to u and positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and w is perpendicular to the galactic plane , positive toward the galactic north pole .",
    "it is noteworthy from the comparison between the observed and expected velocities that the taurus members considered here have very significant peculiar motions ( of amplitude @xmath80 10 km s@xmath58 ) .",
    "since our measured values are very similar to the mean radial velocities and proper motions in catalogs of optically selected taurus members ( e.g.  ducourant et al .",
    "2005 ; bertout & genova 2006 ) , this large peculiar velocity appears to be characteristic of the entire taurus complex .",
    "this is a notable contrast with the stars in the orion cluster where the expected and measured mean proper motions agree to better than 0.5 km s@xmath58 ( gmez et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "section 4.1 and the present kinematics analysis show that if a sufficiently large sample of taurus members had vlbi - based distance determinations , it would become possible to accurately map the three - dimensional distribution of stars in the complex , as well as their detailed kinematics . using a dynamical analysis",
    ", it would then become possible to estimate the total mass of the complex in a way totally independent of the traditionally used molecular observations .",
    "also , coupled with pre - main sequence evolutionary models ( see below ) , it would become possible to study the space distribution of stars as a function of their age , and thereby reconstruct the history of star - formation in taurus .      having measured the distance to two stars in taurus , we are now in a position to recalculate their luminosities , and place them better on an isochrone",

    "both stars appear to be located at about 130 pc , somewhat nearer than the other two taurus stars ( t tauri and v773 tau ) with vlbi distance estimates ( both are at @xmath80 147 pc ) .",
    "the declination of hubble 4 shows small but systematic post - fit residuals that may be the result of an extended , time - variable magnetosphere or of the presence of a companion , low - mass star or brown dwarf .",
    "hubble 4 and hde  283572 appear to share the same kinematics , and most probably belong to the same taurus sub - group . surprisingly , however , pre - main sequence evolutionary models suggest that their age differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "the mean distance to taurus obtained by averaging all four existing vlbi - based distance estimates is 137 pc , and the depth of the complex appears to be about 20 pc , very similar to the size of the complex projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "it is noteworthy that if observations similar to those presented here were obtained for a significantly larger sample of taurus members , it would be possible to map the three - dimensional distribution and kinematics of the complex , and establish the history of star - formation in this important nearby star - forming site .",
