    "the tremendous improvement of the techniques of dealing with ultra cold atoms in the last few years , has paved the way for studying many - body quantum phenomena in an unprecedented manner  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of observation of exotic states of matter , which may have analogies with condensed matter , quark matter and neutron star physics , such as topological phase transitions ( tpt ) , majorana fermions and color superconductivity , has greatly motivated the investigation of pairing and condensation of ultra cold fermi systems under the influence of external electric and magnetic fields  @xcite . while the laser field allows the spin - orbit coupling , the zeeman magnetic field leads to an imbalance between the spin up and spin down chemical potential of the two fermionic species .",

    "motivated by recent experimental realization of synthetic spin - orbit coupling for ultracold atoms  @xcite , we study the ground state of dilute ( spin @xmath0 ) fermi gases .",
    "we investigate the manifestation of two possible induced p - wave pairing gaps , a `` direct '' one .",
    "induced by a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling ( rtsoc ) generated by a synthetic gauge field  @xcite , and that induced by density fluctuations .    from the cold atom side ,",
    "pairing formation in non - conventional systems ( e.g. the one formed by a two - species imbalanced configuration ) is of great interest in the investigation of mixtures of alkali atoms as , for example , lithium - potassium mixtures  @xcite .",
    "a multi - pairing system turns out to be very interesting when compared to the usual configuration , since the ground state now results from a competition not only of fermi surface , chemical potential and mass mismatches , but also from the several pairing gaps that can simultaneously be present  @xcite .",
    "however , these recent investigations in imbalanced ( non - conventional ) systems without rtsoc did not consider interactions between the same component .",
    "in other words , only s - wave ( inter - species ) pairing gaps have been taken into account . in this paper",
    "we consider pairing between the same species from the point of view of induced interactions that can emerge in the two situations we mentioned earlier .    in an imbalanced configuration ,",
    "standard ( bcs ) s - wave pairing is energetically unfavorable to occur  @xcite . in this adverse scenario ,",
    "other kinds of pairing are expected to manifest  @xcite .",
    "intra - species p - wave pairing gaps induced by density fluctuations are our main interest in this work , since those gaps survive in the limit of vanishing rtsoc and chemical potential imbalance .",
    "previous studies ( without rtsoc ) found that while the p - wave energy gain is parametrically smaller in weak coupling , in asymptotic regions of imbalance and coupling the gaps are exponentially suppressed  @xcite .",
    "we find that this is modified in the presence of a rtsoc .",
    "we show that even in weak coupling , the p - wave pairing gap induced by density fluctuations can be greatly enhanced , due to rtsoc .",
    "the possibility of the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state with modulated order parameter  @xcite is ignored in this work .",
    "we consider only pairing between atoms with equal and opposite momenta .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "i , after introducing the model , we obtain a diagonal ( in the helicity basis ) hamiltonian , which contais the free and the rtsoc terms . in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the p - wave pairing gaps in the presence of a rtsoc and by density fluctuations as a function of this rtsoc , and investigate its effects on the p - wave gaps .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "the system we are investigating is an imbalanced fermi gas which is illustrated by fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "an intra - species pairing gap between atoms of same species ( both of spin down ) will naturally emerge , due to interactions induced by density fluctuations , even in the absence of a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this pairing gap is of p - wave , since s - wave induced interactions is forbidden by pauli exclusion . as we will see below",
    ", additional p - wave pairing gaps will manifest , induced by a rtsoc .    to model the ( s - wave ) interaction between the spin - up and spin - down atoms , we consider a uniform 3d polarized fermi gas with a rtsoc , described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the kinetic term",

    "@xmath14 denotes the creation(annihilation ) operators for a fermion with momentum @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the strength of gauge field configuration , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the interaction potential ( for convenience , we set @xmath20 ) .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to the most symmetric synthetic gauge field configuration  @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "this rtsoc interaction , generated by a synthetic gauge field , reduces to the usual rashba spin - orbit coupling term .",
    "the presence of the interaction term in @xmath22 is responsible for the appearance of non - trivial spatial correlations between the fermions of spin @xmath16 and @xmath23 , which are proportional to a gap parameter @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle imposes that the gap parameter has to obey @xmath26 .",
    "there are four possible spin configurations for the two spin @xmath0 fermions considered here : one singlet and three triplets .",
    "the gap parameters may be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "the p - wave triplet refers to angular momentum @xmath29 , for which the magnetic moments are @xmath30 .",
    "the spherical harmonics @xmath28 with @xmath31 can be expressed as a linear function of the vector @xmath15 as  @xcite , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represent a state with two nodal points , while @xmath36 a state with a nodal plane .",
    "the states with order parameter @xmath37 break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "as we will see below , the two induced p - wave triplet pairing gaps we find here are of this type .",
    "it is instructive to diagonalize first @xmath38 , which gives    @xmath39    in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) @xmath40 is the creation(annihilation ) operator for the state with helicity @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .    in the next section",
    "we obtain the p - wave gap induced by a rtsoc , and calculate that induced by density fluctuations .",
    "finally we discuss the relative importance of these contributions in a unique expression .",
    "since we are mainly interested to investigate induced ( by both a rtsoc and density fluctuations ) p - wave triplet pairings , we take a constant ( i.e. , @xmath45-independent ) interaction strength @xmath46 , which is equivalent to consider only spin - singlet pairing . we treat the @xmath4 term using a bcs decoupling , and then write it in the basis that diagonalizes @xmath38  @xcite ,    @xmath47    to regulate the divergence associated with the contact interaction term in @xmath4 , we use    @xmath48    besides the regularization of the ultraviolet divergence present in the gap equation , this equation relates the strength @xmath49 of the contact interaction with the three dimensional scattering length @xmath50 , which is more physically relevant , since it permits to make contact with current experiments .    in eq .",
    "( [ hmf ] ) we have defined @xmath51 , and  @xcite    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , and    @xmath54    @xmath55 is the s - wave energy gap .",
    "notice that @xmath56 .",
    "this shows that in an imbalanced ( @xmath57 ) fermi system with rtsoc , the original s - wave order parameter ( @xmath58 ) has contributions from pairing with both the same and different helicity states  @xcite .",
    "the pairing gaps @xmath59 and @xmath60 are of the p - wave triplet type ( @xmath61 ) as we mentioned earlier .",
    "however , they vanish in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "this is the reason we have named them as `` induced by rtsoc '' p - wave pairing gaps .",
    "the excitation spectra read @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "the vanishing of the excitation energies ( i.e. @xmath65 ) implies the equation    @xmath66    where @xmath67 .",
    "notice that the above equation will be satisfied only for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this gives an equation for a critical field @xmath70 at which a quantum phase transition to a topological superfluid state occurs  @xcite . for a fixed value of @xmath17 and in the limit @xmath71",
    "it is found that the pairing gap which enters in eq .",
    "( [ gaps ] ) behaves as  @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is a constant depending on @xmath17 ) both in 2d  @xcite and 3d  @xcite .",
    "thus , in a highly imbalanced system , the `` direct '' triplet p - wave pairing gaps decrease as  @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , in such an imbalanced configuration , when the imbalance tends to lead the system to the normal state , the direct triplet p - wave pairing gaps are vanishingly small .",
    "this is natural to expect , since the spin - triplet p - wave pairing induced by rtsoc occurs due to the direct short - range s - wave inter - component interaction  @xcite .",
    "as we will see next , there is a second - order interaction , that also generates a p - wave pairing gap , which is that induced by density fluctuations .",
    "this investigation has been carried out previously without rtsoc in , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the p - wave pairing gaps induced by density fluctuations are exponentially suppressed by both the strength of the coupling constant and asymmetry between the up and down species .",
    "we show that they are significantly enhanced when the effects of rtsoc are taken into account .",
    "more importantly , we discuss the limits the p - wave pairing gaps induced by density fluctuations overcome that from first - order contributions .",
    "we start the calculation of the induced interaction for the majority species , i.e. , for the atoms with @xmath75 helicity .",
    "the induced interaction was obtained originally by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov ( gmb ) in the bcs limit by second - order perturbation theory  @xcite . for a ( back - to - back ) scattering process depicted in fig .",
