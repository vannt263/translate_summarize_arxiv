    "we have previously observed that the elastic modulus of the solid is proportional to the confining stress provided by the fluid flow  @xcite .",
    "however , the amount of deformation of the solid in response to a flow perturbation is dependent on the sign of the perturbation : for piles prepared under identical conditions , compressions result in smaller strains than decompressions @xcite . at the bulk scale , this effect can be understood by considering an excluded volume equation of state , as in thermal systems , under the assumption of locally affine deformations . in this paper , we investigate how the particle - scale dynamics lead to deviations from the excluded volume argument at high deformations .",

    "we characterize the influence of cooperative motions by measuring the degree to which the the deformation field locally deviates from global affine deformations .",

    "only affine deformations are present , but non - affine deformations can arise due to either thermally - driven cage - breaking events @xcite or local rearrangements @xcite . here , we quantify two effects : the total non - affine rearrangements , and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the response .",
    "we observe , as expected @xcite , that non - affine deformation fields typically exhibit mesoscale correlations .",
    "furthermore , the non - affine deformations are about twice as large for compressive deformations as compared with decompressive deformations of similar size , and happen over a shorter time scale . for both compressive and decompressive deformations ,",
    "non - affine deformations continue after affine deformations have completed .",
    "our experiments begin by assembling a microsphere heap by flowing a dilute suspension against a barrier ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup]a ) .",
    "the microchannel is fabricated to have a height @xmath2  nm , higher than the height of a barrier ( @xmath3  nm ) , so that the fluid overflow accumulates particles against the barrier of width @xmath4 .",
    "the heights are chosen to create a quasi-2d heap , shallow enough to suppress both stacked and non - stacked bilayer phases @xcite .",
    "the suspension is pumped into the channel by compressing a reservoir at the inlet using a low pressure , piezoelectrically actuated , digital regulator ( aircom pre1-ua1 ) , at @xmath5  kpa above atmospheric pressure .",

    "the coordinate system takes @xmath8 parallel to the barrier and @xmath9 perpendicular to the barrier , with the origin at center of the barrier ; the fluid flow is in the @xmath10 direction .",

    "we use steric and electrostatic stabilization ( sulfate functionalized surface with @xmath14-potential @xmath15  mv and coated with triton x-100 ) to provide reversible inter - particle and channel - particle interactions .",

    "we quantify the affine and non - affine deformation due to a pulse of either compression ( @xmath17 ) or decompression ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the decompression pulse results from a change from 10  kpa to 0.5  kpa over a time scale of 10  ms , and the compression pulse returns the pressure to 10  kpa .",

    "additional images , taken at 27  hz , characterize the particle - scale response of the heap to the change in pressure . after a wait of 100 seconds , long enough for particles to settle onto a new , equilibrated configuration , we repeat this process for the compression pulse .",
    "for either compressive or decompressive pulses , we first compare the initial and final configurations ( separated by 100 sec ) , and quantify both the total deformation and the non - affine deformation .",

    "below , these are referred to as `` long - time '' and `` short - time '' dynamics , and require slightly different image - processing . for the long - time dynamics , the total distance traveled is on the order of a few particle diameters .",

    "we believe that the success in describing our experiments is due to the universality of the van - der - waals thermal argument",
    ". however , that argument breaks down if non - affine motions occur , and we anticipate that the anticipated lower stress at the upstream ( `` top '' ) surface of the flow - stabilized solid is not fully characterized by the van - der - waals argument . in the following ,",
