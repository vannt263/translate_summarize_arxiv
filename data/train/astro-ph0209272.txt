    "the evolution of dust disks into large solid bodies such as asteroids , planets and comets is of central importance in astronomy . while it is usually assumed that such disks are primordial and associated with young stars , some binary systems such as the red rectangle apparently create orbiting reservoirs of gas and dust during their post main sequence evolution ( see waters et al .",
    "1993 , jura & kahane 1999 ) . to date , there are only a few good candidate systems for orbiting dusty circumstellar material around evolved stars , and therefore every example of this phenomenon is worth studying . here",
    ", we propose that the puzzling infrared excess around hd 233517 , a first ascent red giant , can be naturally understood as resulting from a flared , orbiting disk .    attention was originally drawn to hd 233517 because it is a k type star ( m@xmath2 = 9.72 mag ) that is an iras source with an unusually large fractional infrared excess ( @xmath3 @xmath0 0.06 , sylvester , dunkin & barlow 2001 ) produced by cold grains ( @xmath4 @xmath0 100 k ) , and it was thought to be an example of the vega phenomenon  a main sequence star with dust ( walker & wolstencroft 1988 ) . however , detailed spectroscopic studies strongly suggest that hd 233517 is a first ascent red giant with a luminosity near 100 l@xmath1 ( fekel et al .",
    "1996 , balachandran et al .",
    "2000 , zuckerman 2001 ) . while infrared excesses are common around second ascent red giants on the asymptotic giant branch with luminosities in excess of 1000 l@xmath1 ( see , for example , habing 1996 ) , relatively few first ascent red giant stars with their lower luminosities have detectable infrared excesses ( judge , jordan & rowan - robinson 1987 , zuckerman , kim & liu 1995 ) .",
    "hd 233517 has a uniquely high value of @xmath3 among first ascent red giants where this ratio is generally less than 10@xmath5 ( see zuckerman et al .",
    "it is unlikely that hd 233517 is a pre - main sequence star since it does not lie near any known region of star formation and since it lies far from the location of young stars in the h - r diagram ( fekel et al .",
    "1996 , balachandran et al .",
    "also , hd 233517 appears to be similar to a few other k giants which rotate rapidly , have strong lithium lines , a detectable far - infrared excess and are definitely post main sequence since at least in the case of pds 365 , the carbon isotope ratio , @xmath6c/@xmath7c , is approximately 12 ( drake et al . 2002 ) .",
    "three models to explain infrared excesses around first ascent red giants are ( 1 ) dust is being produced by mass loss , ( 2 ) nearby interstellar dust is illuminated accidentally by the red giant , and ( 3 ) the dust is orbiting ( see jura 1999 , kalas et al .",
    "the fraction of red giants that display true dust excesses is uncertain and controversial ( jura 1990 , plets et al .",
    "1997 , jura 1999 , kim , zuckerman & silverstone 2001 ) . in any case , since ground - based imaging shows that the 10 @xmath8 m excess is physically associated with hd 233517 ( skinner et al .",
    "1995 , fisher et al .",
    "2000 ) , at least for this particular star , the dust producing the infrared excess either is orbiting or is expanding away from the star . for some other stars , the infrared excess has been resolved with iso and in these objects , the dust is probably not orbiting ( kim et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "there are difficulties with the model that hd 233517 is currently losing enough mass to produce the observed infrared excess . as with other first ascent red giants with dust , the infrared spectrum of hd 233517 peaks near 60 @xmath8 m .",
    "this spectral energy distribution is characteristic of cool material and is very different from that associated with a continuous mass loss rate where there is a substantial amount of dust near a temperature of 1000 k ( see , for example , sopka et al .",
    "one possibility is that the mass loss rate from hd 233517 is episodic and currently the star is not expelling much matter .",
    "however , as noted by jura ( 1999 ) , the characteristic time scale for the dust to expand around a first ascent red giant to its inferred location may be less than 20 years .",
    "there is no evidence for recent infrared variability of this star , although the star does exhibit a full amplitude optical variation of 0.02 mag with a 47.9 day period which may be caused by star spots rotating in and out of the view ( balachandran et al .",
    "2000 ) .    since the dust around hd 233517 may not be carried in a wind , we consider models where the dust is orbiting the star .",
    "one scenario is that the dust around hd 233517 is simply  left over \" from the main sequence phase .",
    "however , a major difficulty with this model is that the fractional infrared excess around hd 233517 , @xmath3 , of 0.06 is much larger than that found for even the `` dustiest '' main sequence stars such as @xmath9 pic and hr 4796 where @xmath3 is 2 - 4 @xmath10 10@xmath5 ( see , for example , zuckerman 2001 ) .    here , we speculate that hd 233517 had a low mass companion which was engulfed when it became a red giant .",
    "although uncertain , the engulfment of this companion could have led to the ejection of an equatorial ring of orbiting material ( see taam & sandquist 2000 , spruit & taam 2001 ) . as discussed by pringle ( 1991 ) ,",
    "after this ring is created , the matter expands under the action of tidal torques which transfer angular momentum from the binary into the circumstellar material which thus evolves into an extended disk .",
    "although not required in pringle s model , it is possible that in this dense equatorial ring , dust grains formed .",
    "we suggest that the structure of the circumstellar system is described by the models of chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) for passive , orbiting disks which flare in response to the illuminating radiation .",
    "below , we present details of this idealized model .",
    "first , we list our assumed parameters for the star . following balachandran et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we adopt a distance , @xmath11 , of 620 pc , an effective temperature , @xmath12 , of 4475 k a radius , @xmath13 , of 1.1 @xmath10 10@xmath6 cm and a luminosity of 100 l@xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the mass of the star , @xmath14 , is approximately 1 m@xmath1 , consistent with the star s location on the h - r diagram and measured surface gravity ( balachandran et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the rotational velocity of the star is @xmath15 = 17.6 km s@xmath16 which implies if the star rotates as a solid body and if the moment of inertia of the star is @xmath17 ( taken from schwarzschild 1958 ) that the angular momentum of the star is at least 4 @xmath10 10@xmath18 g @xmath19 s@xmath16 .",
    "dust is required to explain the emission from hd 233517 for @xmath20 @xmath21 10 @xmath8 m ( see skinner et al .",
    "1995 ) . here",
    ", we use the model of a opaque , flared disk which is locally in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ) . in this model ,",
    "the temperature , @xmath22 , as a function of distance from the star , @xmath23 , is ( see jura et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath26 is the gravitational constant and @xmath8 is the mean molecular weight of the gas . here , we assume that the gas is primarily h@xmath27 with [ he]/[h@xmath27 ] = 0.2 so that @xmath8 = 3.9 @xmath10 10@xmath29 g. in view of the many uncertainties , and to be consistent with inferences for disks around pre - main sequence stars ( chiang et al . 2001 ) , we assume a simple model where the half - thickness of the vertically - isothermal disk is taken equal to the parameter , @xmath30 , in jura et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which is a factor of @xmath31 larger than @xmath30 in chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) , that characterizes the gaussian density distribution above the plane .",
    "since the disk is opaque , we can determine the flux from the source , @xmath32 , by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the outer boundary of the disk where the temperature is @xmath35 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume a sharp outer boundary although an exponential decay would be more realistic ( see jura et al .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless parameter , @xmath36 : @xmath37 from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : @xmath38 at high frequencies with @xmath39 @xmath40 10 , the observed flux is insensitive to the outer boundary condition since the integral in equation ( 4 ) is approximately 15 .",
    "the spectrum is predicted to vary as @xmath41 . at low frequencies where @xmath39 @xmath422 , we may re - write equation ( 4 ) to find that : @xmath43",
    "if the disk is opaque , then at low frequencies , f@xmath44 varies as @xmath45 .    for the data in the iras faint source catalog , between 12 @xmath8 m and 60 @xmath8 m , f@xmath44 varies as @xmath46 , in good agreement with the prediction that f@xmath44 should vary as @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath39 @xmath48 1 and cos @xmath49 = 0@xmath50 , from equation ( 4 ) , the predicted value of f@xmath44(25 @xmath8 m ) is 3.9 jy which agrees with the observed value of 3.4 jy .",
    "thus , without any  tweaking \" , the predictions are close enough to the data that the model should be taken seriously .    near 60 @xmath8 m",
    ", the slope of the spectral energy distribution turns over . in the flared disk model , the peak in the spectral energy distribution",
    "is governed by the outer boundary of the disk .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , we have found that a model with @xmath35 = 70 k , which occurs at @xmath34 = 45 au , can reproduce much of the infrared data .",
    "however , at 1.35 mm , much more flux is predicted than the observed value of 2.6 @xmath51 1.0 , which is conservatively interpreted as a 3@xmath52 upper limit of 3 mjy by sylvester et al .",
    "a possible resolution of this discrepancy is discussed below .",
    "the flared disk model drastically overestimates the flux at 1.35 mm .",
    "it is observed that between 1.35 mm and 100 @xmath8 m , f@xmath44 varies as @xmath53 which suggests that at least at the longer wavelength , the system is optically thin . if the circumstellar dust particles are smaller than 100 @xmath8 m in diameter , then the opacity at 1.35 mm is probably considerably smaller than the opacity at 100 @xmath8 m .",
    "although the composition and size distribution of the dust particles are unknown ; we adopt parameters representative of circumstellar  silicates \" from ossenkopf , henning & mathis ( 1992 ) and pollack et al .",
    "thus , we take @xmath54(100 @xmath8 m ) = 25 @xmath19 g@xmath16 , and for @xmath20 @xmath40 100 @xmath8 m , we assume that @xmath54 scales as @xmath45 so that @xmath54(1.35 mm ) = 0.14 @xmath19 g@xmath16 .",
    "to calculate the flux for the optically thin regime , we need to describe the mass distribution . if @xmath55 denotes the total dust surface density of the disk , then we approximate the model of pringle ( 1991 ) for a circumbinary disk by assuming that all the matter is confined within angular radius @xmath56 , where @xmath57 = @xmath58 , and that within this region , @xmath59 with this description , if @xmath60 denotes the mass of dust in the disk , then : @xmath61    the flux from the disk , @xmath62 , is : @xmath63 we evaluate equation ( 8) for the condition that at @xmath23 = @xmath34 ( or 45 au ) , @xmath64 = 0.04 g @xmath65 . as discussed below , this value of @xmath64",
    "is chosen so that the disk is opaque at 100 @xmath8 m at its outermost region .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 . with the revised model",
    ", we see that the predicted flux at 1.35 mm is consistent with the upper limit reported by sylvester et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the flared disk model requires that gas be in hydrostatic equilibrium vertical to the orbiting plane of the system .",
    "we can estimate the expected amount of co emission from hd 233517 if the gas and grain temperatures are equal to each other .",
    "first , @xmath66 if the gas is optically thick , then in a telescope of beam size , @xmath67 , the observed brightness temperature , @xmath68 is @xmath69 within the 105 beam of the iram telescope , jura & kahane ( 1999 ) placed a 1@xmath52 upper limit to the co j 2@xmath701 emission line of 29 mk . in our model , @xmath56 = 0073 , and",
    "the predicted brightness temperature in this line is 17 mk .",
    "thus the model is consistent with the observed upper limit to the co line emission .",
    "we derive a minimum mass of the disk from the criterion that our model requires the disk to be opaque even at @xmath23 = @xmath34 at 100 @xmath8 m or @xmath71(100 @xmath8 m ) @xmath40 1 . with @xmath54(100 @xmath8",
    "m ) = 25 @xmath19 g@xmath16 , this implies that @xmath64 @xmath21 0.04 @xmath19 g@xmath16 . therefore , from equation",
    "( 7 ) , the mass of the dust in the disk is 2 @xmath10 10@xmath72 g. if the gas to dust ratio is 100 , the total disk mass is @xmath00.01 m@xmath1    another important parameter is the disk angular momentum , @xmath73 . with a sharp outer boundary and the surface density variation given by equation ( 6 )",
    ", we may write : @xmath74",
    "we therefore estimate a total angular momentum of the disk of 3 @xmath10 10@xmath75 g @xmath19 s@xmath16 , which is larger than the total angular momentum of the star estimated above to be @xmath21 4 @xmath10 10@xmath18 g @xmath19 s@xmath16 .",
    "we have found that the infrared fluxes from hd 233517 are naturally explained with the simple flared disk model .",
    "the origin of this disk is uncertain .",
    "one possible model to account both for the creation of a disk and the unusually high rotation speed of the red giant is that while on the main sequence , hd 233517 had a companion at an orbital separation of about 1 @xmath10 10@xmath6 cm ( see soker , livio & harpaz 1984 ) . we speculate that when hd 233517 became a red giant , it engulfed this companion with the consequences of both creating an orbiting ring of circumbinary matter and spinning up the primary star . with the parameters derived above ,",
    "the total angular momentum of hd 233517 and its associated disk is 3 @xmath10 10@xmath75 g @xmath19 s@xmath16 .",
    "this amount of angular momentum could have been supplied by a companion star of 0.12 m@xmath1 in a circular orbit of radius 1.1 @xmath10 10@xmath6 cm .",
    "hd 233517 is a lithium - rich star ( fekel et al .",
    "1996 , balachandran et al .",
    "2000 ) . while single - star models might explain this result ( de la reza et al .",
    "1997 , jasniewicz et al . 1999 ,",
    "charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ) , in our picture , this lithium enrichment results because the system was a binary .",
    "the absence of @xmath76li argues against the simple idea that incorporation of lithium from a planet or low mass companion into the envelope of the star ( balachandran et al .",
    "2000 ) can explain the observed abundance of this element , but the capture of a companion might have led to an episode that stimulated interior mixing of lithium to the surface ( denissenkov & weiss 2000 ) .    with a value of @xmath3 @xmath40 10@xmath77 ,",
    "hd 233517 is a distinctive red giant . in the sample of zuckerman",
    "( 1995 ) of more than 40,000 of the nearest luminosity class iii giants , the highest value of @xmath3 is 10@xmath5 .",
    "although the statistics are poor , perhaps only 10@xmath78 of all first ascent red giants have as much circumstellar opacity as does hd 233517 .",
    "we suggest that hd 233517 is unusual for two reasons .",
    "first , according to duqennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) , only @xmath02% of all solar - mass main sequence stars have detectable companions with orbital periods near 10 days .",
    "such binaries are the kinds of systems that can evolve into a red giant with a substantial disk as is found around hd 233517 .",
    "furthermore , once the disk is formed , it must have a limited lifetime .",
    "the massive dusty disk around hd 233517 may evolve in a fashion somewhat like disks around pre - main sequence stars . for a type stars which have luminosities somwhat less than that of hd 233517 , the lifetime of the disk as a system with @xmath3 @xmath40 10@xmath77 is near 3 @xmath10 10@xmath76 years , although some small amount of dust could linger for as long as 4 @xmath10 10@xmath79 years ( see habing et al .",
    "1999 , spangler et al .",
    "2001 ) . since the lifetime of a 1 m@xmath1 red giant as it evolves from 10 l@xmath1 to its maximum luminosity of 2700 l@xmath1 is @xmath02 @xmath10 10@xmath79 years ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) , only @xmath0 1% of the disks around red giants might have @xmath3 as large as 10@xmath77 .",
    "given these two considerations , it is not too surprising that a system like hd 233517 occurs among first ascent red giants with a frequency of perhaps 10@xmath78 .",
    "a plausible explanation for the inferred decrease of @xmath3 with time is that the dust particles coalesce into larger bodies .",
    "we have modeled the currently available infrared data for hd 233517 and find that the observations can be naturally explained by a flared , orbiting disk of mass @xmath00.01 m@xmath1 and outer radius of @xmath045 au .",
    "we speculate that this disk was created by the engulfment of a low mass stellar companion .",
