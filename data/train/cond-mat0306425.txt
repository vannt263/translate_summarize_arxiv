    "all these nanomachines correspond to the case where the corrugation of the interwall interaction energy has little or no effect on relative motion of nanotube walls . however , all of carbon nanotube walls have the helical symmetry and this gives the possibility for neighbouring walls of nanotube to be bolt - and - nut pair .",

    "a ) type i of the potential relief , b ) type ii of the potential relief.,width=680,height=302 ]    we have studied the potential relief for the ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) , ( 8,2)@(12,8 ) , and ( 8,2)@(17,2 ) nanotubes , corresponding to the case of the potential relief with the helical lines of `` thread '' @xcite . for the long inner wall only hexagons that are far from the wall edge take part in the walls interaction . since such hexagons of the network are equivalent , than the same positions of the short outer wall relative to any hexagon of the long inner wall are also equivalent . to the contrary , the hexagons of the short outer wall are not equivalent due to the different distances to the wall edge . for this reason ,",
    "the short outer wall can be considered as one large molecule `` adsorbed '' on the surface of the inner wall .",
    "consequently , the potential relief reproduces only the structure of the long inner wall .",
    "thus we have plotted the potential relief for the ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) nanotube and the structure of the inner wall network on the same figure ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . evidently that the minima of potential relief form the lattice that correlates with the lattice of the inner wall network .",
    "such correlation is observed for all considered nanotubes .",
    "two types of the potential relief minima lattices are found .",
    "the type i , shown in fig .",
    "3a , corresponds to the rectangular lattice of minima .",
    "such a relief have the ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and ( 8,2)@(12,8 ) nanotubes .",
    "the type ii of potential relief , shown in fig .",
    "3b , corresponds to the oblique lattice of minima with the lattice vectors having the equal lengths and angle between lattice vectors equals to 60@xmath33 .",
    "such a relief has ( 8,2)@(17,2 ) nanotube .",
    "let us convert the angle coordinate to the length @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represents the length of projection of any wall atom path along the wall surface on the wall circumference , @xmath36 is the inner wall radius .",
    "in this coordinate system the lattice vectors have the lengths @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the type i of the potential relief and @xmath39 for the type ii of the potential relief . for both types of the potential relief",
    "the angle @xmath40 between the thread line and the wall circumference equals to the chirality angle @xmath5 of the inner wall .    the barriers @xmath41 and @xmath42 between neighbouring minima in the directions along the lattice vectors @xmath28 and @xmath32 are different .",
    "the threadlike pattern of the potential relief arise due to the essential difference between barriers @xmath41 for relative motion of walls along the thread line and @xmath42 for transition of the system to neighbouring thread line ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the nanotubes considered are incommensurate . therefore the threadlike pattern of the potential relief change with changing of outer wall length .",
    "the barriers to any kind of relative motion of incommensurate walls fluctuate near their average value analogeously to the sum of functions @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an integer @xcite .",
    "that is the barriers for the long nanotubes are the same order of magnitude as the analogeous barriers for the nanotubes with the outer wall length to be equal to few unit cell lengths .",
    "the dependencies of barriers @xmath41 and @xmath42 on the outer wall length are shown in fig .",
    "4 and fig .",
    "5 , respectively . one can see that the barriers change by order of magnitude for all nanotubes considered , while the outer wall length changes by only few nanometers .",
    "note that these dependencies for both barriers , at least for two of three considered nanotubes , are quasiperiodic functions .     the dependence of the barrier @xmath41 for relative motion of walls along the thread line on the length @xmath27 of outer wall .",
    "filled circles , filled triangles and filled squares correspond respectively to ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) , ( 8,2)@(12,8 ) and ( 8,2)@(17,2 ) nanotubes.,height=302 ]     the dependence of the barrier @xmath42 for transition of the system on neighbouring thread line on the length @xmath27 of outer wall . filled circles , filled triangles and filled squares correspond respectively to ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) , ( 8,2)@(12,8 ) and ( 8,2)@(17,2 ) nanotubes.,height=302 ]    as was discussed above the quantity that characterize the possibility for double - wall nanotube to have threadlike pattern of potential relief is not barrier itself but rather ratio @xmath46 of barriers to the motion across the thread line and along it , respectively .",
    "it is naturally to call this ratio as relative thread depth .",
    "the dependence of relative thread depth on outer wall length is shown in fig .",
    "if average periods of mentioned quasiperiodic functions are close and oscillations of functions are in phase for both barriers then the relative thread depth can be large for essential changes of outer wall length .",
    "the example of such a possibility is ( 8,2)@(12,8 ) nanotube . in this case fabrication of double - wall nanotube with given relative thread depth",
    "can be possible .",
    "if average periods of mentioned quasiperiodic functions are not close or oscillations of function are not in phase then changes in relative thread depth under changes of outer wall length can be of orders of magnitude .",
    "the examples of such a possibility are ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) and ( 8,2)@(17,2 ) nanotubes .",
    "moreover the relative thread depth for ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) nanotube is less than 1 at some lengths of outer wall .",
    "this means disappearance of threadlike relief or possible appearance of threadlike relief with different parameters .    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 8     the dependence of the ratio @xmath47 characterizing the `` thread '' depth on the length @xmath27 of outer wall .",
    "filled circles , filled triangles and filled squares correspond respectively to ( 6,4)@(16,4 ) , ( 8,2)@(12,8 ) and ( 8,2)@(17,2 ) nanotubes.,height=302 ]    thus our calculations show that both for relative motion of walls along the thread line and for transition of the system to neighbouring thread line , respectively , barriers change by order of magnitude for all nanotubes considered as the outer wall length changes by only few nanometers .",
    "therefore it is difficult to fabricate the double - wall nanotube with incommensurate walls but with _ controlled _ values of barriers @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus nanotubes with incommensurate walls are too hard to use in nanomachines based on relative motion of walls where the _ precise control _ of relative position of walls is necessary .",
    "however such nanotubes can be used in nanomachines based on fast relative motion of walls where only the presence of `` threadlike '' potential relief with high value of relative thread depth @xmath48 is necessary .",
    "the barriers to any kind of relative motion of commensurate walls with lengths corresponding to integer number of nanotube elementary cells are given by relation @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the barrier per unit cell of the nanotube , @xmath51 is a number of unit cells in the nanotube ( the interaction with atoms on the edge of wall is disregarded here ) .",
    "thus the barrier @xmath52 for sufficiently long nanotube is proportional to its length and can be possible to obtain the given value of barrier by choice of nanotube length .",
    "the analysis show that for some two - wall nanotubes with integer number of elementary cells the barriers can be extremely small in comparison with total interwall interaction energy .",
    "the reason the fact is following .",
    "the potential field produced by each wall can be expanded in the basis of harmonics invariant under symmetry group of the wall @xcite . only harmonics with symmetry compatible with both walls can contribute in the interwall interaction potential relief @xmath53 . as was shown on example of nonchiral wall ( 12,12 ) the amplitudes of these harmonics sharply decrease and",
    "rapidly becomes negligible .",
    "for example , in ( 7,7)@(12,12 ) nanotube only 24-th harmonic of expansion of potential field produced by wall ( 7,7 ) can contribute in the angle dependence of the interwall interaction energy .",
    "therefore it was found that barrier for relative wall rotation for this nanotube is less than calculation accuracy @xcite .",
    "the analogous results one can expect for the majority of nanotubes with chiral commensurate walls .",
    "to systemize the search of nanotubes with commensurate walls and threadlike potential relief the notion of equivalence class of walls can be introduced ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "an equivalence class is the set of all walls with chirality indexes @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is integer , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are coprime natural numbers , @xmath55 is called diameter index and pair @xmath58 is called chirality indexes of the class .",
    "if the walls from different equivalence classes @xmath59 and @xmath60 are commensurate then the interwall distance for the nanotube @xmath61 composed of these walls is given by the formula    @xmath62    such a pair of equivalence classes generates double - wall nanotubes families with the geometrical parameters that are the same for all nanotubes of each family : the interwall distance , unit cell length of nanotube and difference of chirality angles of walls .",
    "let us study now the nanomechanical problem , dynamics of relative motion of double - wall nanotube interacting walls under the action of external forces .",
    "the wall interaction potential is denoted as @xmath53 , where @xmath1 is the angle of wall relative rotation about nanotube axis and @xmath2 is the wall relative displacement along nanotube axis .",
    "one wall is treated as fixed and the motion of second wall relative to the one is examined .",
    "we consider the case where external force causes the relative motion of walls but does not cause their deformation . in this case",
    "forces @xmath63 that acts on each atom of movable wall have equal magnitudes .",
    "this forces can be divided into two components @xmath64 where components @xmath65 and @xmath66 are directed along the nanotube axis ( first type forces ) and along the tangent to nanotube circumference ( second type forces ) , respectively .",
    "the forces of considered type can have , for example , electrostatic nature @xcite or can be applied by the nanomanipulator @xcite or by laser electric fields @xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that for case considered resultant force @xmath67 corresponding to components @xmath66 can be majorize as    @xmath68    where @xmath18 is number of graphite unit cell in a unit cell of one - dimensional crystal corresponding to the movable wall , @xmath69 is the number of complete revolutions of helical line determined by the wall symmetry @xcite per unit cell of the wall .",
    "thus for sufficiently long wall the contribution of tangential components @xmath66 in resultant force acting on movable wall center of mass can be disregarded .",
    "therefore tangential components @xmath66 cause only rotation of wall and wall center of mass moves only along nanotube axis . on using once again",
    "the transformation @xmath34 it is easily to show that equations of motion of center of mass and rotation for movable wall are equivalent to one vector equation    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the movable wall mass , @xmath72 is vector with components @xmath2 and @xmath35 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 is number of atoms in the movable wall .",
    "thus the motion of one wall of double - wall carbon nanotube relative to fixed wall in the absence of external forces or under the action of external forces satisfying the conditions described above is equivalent to two - dimensional motion of particle with mass @xmath71 in the potential field @xmath75 and under the action of external force @xmath76 .",
    "now we shall obtain fokker - planck equation describing relative diffusive motion of carbon nanotube walls and their drift under the action of force @xmath76 .",
    "we consider the case corresponding to the simulations performed .",
    "firstly let the length of movable wall is considerably less than length of fixed wall and movable wall is placed far from fixed wall edges so that interaction of movable wall with atoms at the edge of fixed wall has negligible effect on the potential relief .",
    "thus we leave aside the case where relative motion of walls is telescopic with the extension of outer wall outside inner one . in last case contact area of walls and , consequently , corresponding surface energy substantially depend on @xmath2 , and , consequently , the minima of potential relief can disappear . secondly , let the minima @xmath77 of potential relief @xmath75 form the lattice with lattice vectors @xmath28 and @xmath32 as it is shown in fig .",
    "2 . the relative motion of walls can be diffusion with drift only in the case @xmath78 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the barriers between minima @xmath77 for motion along lattice vectors @xmath28 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we restrict ourselves by the case of @xmath43 , that is the case of one - dimensional diffusion in direction along lattice vector @xmath28 . in this case , if the direction of @xmath28 coincides with the direction of vertical z - axis or horizontal @xmath1-axis , the considered relative motion of walls is relative sliding or rotation , respectively .",
    "otherwise this motion is analogeous to the relative motion of bolt - and - nut pair .",
    "let us consider the ensemble of `` particles '' with the motion described by equation ( [ mov ] ) , where potential @xmath75 and force @xmath76 have all properties described above .",
    "the number of particles @xmath79 passing during the time @xmath80 through normal to diffusion direction segment @xmath81 is given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are numbers of particles passing in opposite directions @xmath85 and @xmath86 between neighbouring minima @xmath77 separated by segment @xmath81 ; @xmath87 and @xmath88 are concentrations of particles at some distances @xmath89 from segment @xmath81 corresponding to particles moving in directions @xmath28 and @xmath86 ; @xmath89 is the collision mean free path of particles before passing through segment @xmath81 ; @xmath90 and @xmath91 are average velocities of particle displacement in directions @xmath28 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "these velocities are given by    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the distance between neighbouring minima in the motion direction , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are average times of displacement between two neighbouring minima for motion in directions @xmath28 and @xmath86 , respectively , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are probabilities of corresponding displacements .",
    "the quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 are not equal in result of force @xmath100 action .",
    "namely , the barriers @xmath41 between neighbouring minima change by the work @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the projection of @xmath100 on particle motion direction .",
    "this change is decrease if @xmath102 is directed along the particle motion and increase otherwise .",
    "the probabilities @xmath98 and @xmath99 are given approximately by arrhenius formula    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is a frequency which has the same order of magnitude as oscillation frequency of the particle near the minimum .",
    "the particle motion is diffusion if @xmath105 and drift ( that is the time - average acceleration is zero ) if @xmath106 . to produce the fokker - planck equation the first term of exponent @xmath107 expansion",
    "must be used , therefore the condition @xmath108 is also necessary .    substituting ( [ u])([w ] ) in ( [ dn ] ) , we get    @xmath109 d \\xi d t\\ ] ]    with the substitutions @xmath110 and @xmath111 equation ( [ dn2 ] ) takes the form of fokker - planck equation :    @xmath112    here @xmath113 and @xmath114 are , respectively , diffusion coefficient and mobility of particles given by    @xmath115    @xmath116    note , that einstein ratio @xmath117 is fulfilled .",
    "the behaviour of one particle with fixed coordinates at @xmath118 is described by solution @xmath119 of the equation ( [ dn3 ] ) that satisfy two conditions : 1 ) at @xmath118 all the concentration is placed on a line normal to the diffusion direction and the concentration elsewhere on the plane is zero ; 2 ) the total number of particles is equal to 1 .",
    "we consider here two types of nanomachines based on relative motion of nanotube walls .",
    "let us discuss firstly possible advantages of application of nanotubes with threadlike potential relief of the interwall interaction energy in nanomachines where the direction of forces applied on movable wall does not correspond to desirable kind of wall motion .",
    "in the case where the potential relief has negligible effect on relative motion of walls , the directions of forces applied on movable wall must correspond to direction of relative motion of walls .",
    "namely , if the relative motion of walls is sliding along nanotube axis , as it take place in constant - force nanosprings @xcite , gigahertz oscillators @xcite , and mechanical nanoswitch @xcite , than the forces applied on movable wall are bound to be directed along nanotube axis ( first type forces ) .",
    "if the relative motion of walls is relative rotation , as it take place in nanobearings @xcite and nanogears @xcite than the forces applied on movable wall must to be directed along the tangent to its circumference ( second type forces ) .",
    "however the presence of threadlike potential relief of the interwall interaction energy remove the restriction on directions of forces applied on movable wall .",
    "the analysis above shows that relative motion of walls along helical line of `` thread '' is possible for both discussed types of external forces and any their superposition .",
    "therefore the first type forces produce not only a relative sliding of walls along axis but also their relative rotation .",
    "therefore a nanomachine based on wall motion can operate as a _",
    "nanowhirligig_. the proposed way to convert the forces directed along nanotube axis into relative rotation of walls can be used in nanobearings and nanogears .",
    "the second type forces producing a rotational moment gives rise not only a relative rotation but also a relative motion of walls along nanotube axis .",
    "this effect provides a possibility to construct a nanomachine based on carbon nanotube that is analogeous to old - desinged _ faucet _ where rotation of handle converts into forward motion of rod .",
    "we propose here also principally new type of nanomachines that may be based on nanotubes with only threadlike potential relief of the interwall interaction energy .",
    "the using of alternating - sign force to operate the relative position of walls can produce a motion of walls that is analogeous to the motion of auger in a perforating drill .",
    "such a _ perforating nanodrill _ can be used for modification of surface in nanometer size ( see fig .",

    "two nanometer size systems with the conductivity which can be tuned within orders of magnitude by the rotation of a nanotube wall or its displacement along the axis were considered .",
    "the first one consists of two single - wall nanotubes and a fullerene between them @xcite ( see fig .",
    "7b ) , and the second one is an telescoping nanotube @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the tuning can be controlled with the help of nanodevice based on relative motion of nanotube walls . as a result _",

    "a _ variable nanoresistor _ can be constructed , where wall of nanotube is both movable element and element of electric circuit .",
    "let us discuss possible operation modes of nanomachines based on relative motion of nanotube walls along line of thread . as we have shown above , in the case , when conditions @xmath78 and @xmath108 are fulfilled , the relative motion of carbon nanotube walls is described by fokker - planck equation ( [ dn3 ] ) .",
    "the operation mode of nanomachine based on such a motion is called here fokker - planck operation mode .",
