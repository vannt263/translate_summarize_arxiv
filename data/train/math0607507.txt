    "the notion of _ pagerank _ was introduced by google in order to numerically characterize popularity of web pages .",
    "the original description of the pagerank presented in @xcite is as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the pagerank of page @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the number of outgoing links of page @xmath5 , the sum is taken over all pages @xmath5 that link to page @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the  damping factor \" , which is some constant between 0 and 1 . from this equation",
    "it is clear that the pagerank of a page depends on the number of pages that link to it and the importance ( i.e. pageranks ) of these pages .    in this paper",
    "we study the relation between the probability distribution of the pagerank and the _ in - degree _ of a randomly selected web page , where the in - degree denotes simply the number of incoming hyperlinks of a web page .",
    "pandurangan et al .",
    "@xcite observed that the probability distributions of the pagerank and the in - degree for web data have a similar asymptotic behavior , or , more precisely , they seem to follow power laws with the same exponent . loosely speaking ,",
    "a ` power law ' with exponent @xmath7 means that the probability that the random variable takes some large value @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath9 . for the pagerank and the in - degree distribution ,",
    "the exponent @xmath7 is approximately @xmath10 .",
    "recent extensive experiments by donato et al .",
    "@xcite and fortunato et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed the similarity in tail behavior observed in  @xcite .",
    "becchetti and + castillo  @xcite extensively investigated the influence of the damping factor @xmath6 on the power law behavior of the pagerank .",
    "they have shown that the pagerank of the top @xmath11 of the nodes always follows a power law with the same exponent independent of the value of the damping factor .",
    "our own experiments based on web data from @xcite are also in agreement with  @xcite ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "obviously , equation  ( [ e1 ] ) suggests that the pagerank and the in - degree are intimately related , but this formula by itself does not explain the observed similarity in tail behavior .",
    "furthermore , the linear algebra methods that have been commonly used in the pagerank literature  @xcite and proved very successful for designing efficient computational methods , seem to be insufficient for modelling and analyzing the asymptotic properties of the pagerank distribution .",
    "the goal of our paper is to provide mathematical evidence for the power - law behavior of the pagerank and its relation to the in - degree distribution .",
    "we propose a stochastic model that aims to explain this phenomenon .",
    "our approach is inspired by the techniques from applied probability and stochastic operations research .",
    "the relation between the pagerank and the in - degree is modelled through a distributional identity which is analogous to the equation for the busy period in the m / g/1 queue ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "further , we analyze our model using the approach employed in @xcite for studying the tail behavior of the busy period in case the service times are regularly varying random variables .",
    "this fits in our research because regular variation is in fact a generalization of the power law , and it has been widely used in queueing theory to model self - similarity , long - range dependence and heavy tails  @xcite .",
    "thus , we use the notion of regular variation to model the power law distribution of the in - degree . for the sake of completeness , in section  [ section_prelim ] , we will introduce regularly varying random variables and describe their basic properties .    to obtain the tail behavior of the pagerank in our model",
    ", we use laplace - stieltjes transforms and apply tauberian theorems presented in the well - known paper by bingham and doney @xcite , see also theorem  8.1.6 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , our analysis allows to explicitly derive the constant multiplicative factor that quantifies the difference between the pagerank and the in - degree tail behavior .",
    "our analytical results show a remarkable agreement with real web data .",
    "we believe that our approach is extremely promising for analyzing the pagerank distribution and solving other problems related to the structural properties of the web . at the end of this paper",
    ", we will briefly mention other possibilities for probabilistic analysis of the pagerank distribution .",
    "in particular , we provide experimental results for growing networks  @xcite , and draw a parallel between the recent studies @xcite on the pagerank behavior in this class of graph models and our present work .",
    "this section describes important properties of regularly varying random variables . we follow definitions and notations by bingham and doney  @xcite , meyer and teugels  @xcite and zwart  @xcite .",
    "more comprehensive details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we say that a function @xmath12 is _ regularly varying _ of index @xmath13 if for every @xmath14 , @xmath15 if @xmath16 , then @xmath17 is called _",
    "slowly varying_. slowly varying functions are usually denoted by @xmath18 : for every @xmath14 , @xmath19 then , a function @xmath12 is regularly varying if and only if it can be written in the form @xmath20 for some slowly varying @xmath21 .",
    "the following lemma provides a useful bound for slowly varying functions .",
    "[ potterbound ] ( potter bounds ) let @xmath18 be a slowly varying function .",
    "then , for any fixed @xmath22 there exists a finite constant @xmath23 such that for all @xmath24 @xmath25    in probability theory a random variable @xmath26 is said to be _ regularly varying _ with index ( or exponent ) @xmath7 if its distribution function @xmath27 is such that @xmath28 for some positive slowly varying function @xmath21 . here ,",
    "as in the remainder of this paper , the notation @xmath29 means that @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the laplace - stieltjes transform of @xmath26 by @xmath31 and the @xmath32th moment @xmath33 by the corresponding letter @xmath34 .",
    "the successive moments of @xmath35 can be obtained by expanding @xmath31 in a series at @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , we have the following .",
    "[ applem]the @xmath32th moment of @xmath26 is finite if and only if there exist numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that @xmath39    if @xmath40 then we introduce the notation @xmath41",
    "@xmath42    [ n1 ] it follows from lemma [ applem ] that the @xmath32th moment of @xmath26 is finite if and only if there exist numbers @xmath37 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44    the following theorem establishes the relation between asymptotic behavior of regularly varying distribution and its laplace - stieltjes transform",
    ". this result will play an essential role in our analysis .",
    "[ appth ] ( tauberian theorem ) if @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , then the following are equivalent    @xmath49    @xmath50 .    here and in the remainder of the paper we use the letter @xmath7 to denote the index of a complementary distribution function rather than a density .",
    "the power law exponent of the in - degree in the web graph then becomes @xmath51 rather than @xmath10 .",
    "in this section we introduce a model that describes the relation between the pagerank and the in - degree distributions in the form of a stochastic equation .",
    "this model naturally follows from the definition of the pagerank ( [ e1 ] ) , and is analytically tractable for obtaining the asymptotic behavior of the pagerank .",
    "our goal now is to describe the relation between the pagerank and the in - degree . to this end , we keep equation ( [ e1 ] ) almost unchanged but we make several assumptions .",
    "first , let @xmath52 be the pagerank of a randomly chosen page .",
    "we treat @xmath52 simply as a random variable whose distribution we want to determine .",
    "second , we assume that the number of outgoing links @xmath53 is the same for each page",
    ". then @xmath52 satisfies a distributional identity @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the in - degree of the considered random page .",
    "we now make the assumption that the @xmath56 s are independent and have the same distribution as @xmath52 itself .",
    "we note that the independence assumption is obviously not true in general .",
    "however , it is also not the case that the pagerank values of the pages linking to the same page  @xmath3 are directly related , so we may assume independence in this study .",
    "the novelty of our approach is that we treat the pagerank as a random variable which solves a certain stochastic equation .",
    "however , this approach is quite natural if our goal is to explain the ` power law ' behavior of the pagerank because the ` power law ' is merely a description of a certain class of probability distributions .",
    "in fact , this point of view is in line with empirical results by pandurangan et al .",
    "@xcite and other authors who consistently present the ( log - log ) _ histogram _ of the pagerank .",
    "one of the nice features of stochastic equation ( [ e2a ] ) is that it has the same form as the original formula ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we may hope that our model correctly describes the relation between the in - degree and the pagerank .",
    "this is easy to verify in the extreme ( unrealistic ) case when all pages have the same in - degree @xmath53 . in this situation ,",
    "the pageranks of all pages are equal , and it is easy to verify that @xmath57 constitutes the unique solution of ( [ e2a ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that the in - degree of web pages follows a power law . for our analysis",
    "however we need a more formal description of this random variable , thus , we suggest to employ the theory of regular variation .",
    "we model the in - degree of a randomly chosen page as a nonnegative , integer , regularly varying random variable , which is distributed as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is regularly varying with index @xmath7 and @xmath60 is the number of poisson arrivals on the time interval @xmath61 $ ] . without loss of generality , we assume that the rate of the poisson process is equal to @xmath62 .",
    "the advantage of this construction is that we do not need to impose any restrictions on @xmath59 and at the same time ensure that the in - degree is integer .",
    "we claim that the random variable @xmath58 will also be regularly varying with the same index as @xmath59 , or , more informally , @xmath58 follows a power law with the same exponent .",
    "thus , we can think of @xmath58 as the in - degree of a random web page .",
    "for the sake of completeness we present the formal statement and its proof in the remainder of this section .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath31 and @xmath65 be the distribution functions and the laplace - stieltjes transforms of @xmath59 and @xmath58 , respectively . since the random variable @xmath59 is regularly varying , we have by definition @xmath66 where @xmath21 is some slowly varying function .",
    "then we will claim that for @xmath58 the following also holds : @xmath67    to prove this statement we use the tauberian theorem ( theorem [ appth ] ) . in order to satisfy the conditions of this theorem , we should first verify whether the corresponding moments of @xmath59 and @xmath58 always exist together .",
    "assuming that @xmath68 we immediately get @xmath69 .",
    "next , consider the generating function of @xmath58 , @xmath70 from which we derive the laplace - stieltjes transform of @xmath58 in terms of the laplace - stieltjes transform of @xmath59 : @xmath71    now , denote by @xmath72 and @xmath73 the first @xmath32 moments of @xmath59 and @xmath58 , respectively , and define @xmath74",
    ". then we can formulate the next lemma .",
    "the following are equivalent    * @xmath75 * @xmath76 [ l3 ]    by lemma [ applem ] we know that @xmath40 if and only if @xmath77 can be written as @xmath78 denote @xmath79 , then @xmath80 as @xmath81 , and we can substitute @xmath82 which can be written as @xmath83 for some finite constants @xmath84 and @xmath73 , that can be expressed in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , by uniqueness of the power series expansion and by lemma [ applem ] we have @xmath76    similarly , @xmath85 as @xmath86 , so we obtain @xmath87 for @xmath37 and some @xmath72 that can be expressed in terms of @xmath84 and @xmath73 , which similarly implies @xmath40 .    if we define @xmath88 @xmath89 as in ( [ ndef ] )",
    ", then we can reformulate lemma [ l3 ] as follows : @xmath90    now , we can use theorem [ appth ] to prove that ( [ ein1 ] ) implies ( [ ein2 ] ) .",
    "in fact also the reverse holds , as stated in the next theorem .    the following are equivalent    @xmath91    @xmath92 [ t3 ]    from theorem  [ appth ] for @xmath59 we know that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is not integer and @xmath32 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath95 , by lemma  [ l3 ] we have @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , as @xmath98 .",
    "so , we can obtain from ( [ e3 ] ) by using lemma [ potterbound ] that @xmath99 now we again apply theorem  [ appth ] to conclude that @xmath100    similar to the first part of the proof .",
    "thus , our model for the number of incoming links properly describes an in - degree distribution that follows a power law with finite expectation and a non - integer exponent .",
    "combining the ideas from sections  [ section_pr ] and [ section_nt ] , we arrive to the following equation @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the damping factor , @xmath103 is the fixed out - degree of each page , and @xmath58 describes the in - degree of a randomly chosen page as the number of poisson arrivals on a regularly varying time interval @xmath59 . as we discussed above , stochastic equation ( [ e2 ] ) adequately captures several important aspects of the pagerank distribution and its relation to the in - degree .",
    "moreover , our model is completely formalized , and thus we can apply analytical methods in order to derive the tail behavior of the random variable @xmath52 representing the pagerank .",
    "linear stochastic equations like ( [ e2 ] ) have a long history .",
    "in particular , ( [ e2 ] ) is similar to the famous equation that arises in the theory of branching processes and describes many real - life phenomena , for instance , the distribution of the busy period in the @xmath0 queue : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the distribution of the busy period ( the time interval during which the queue is non - empty ) , @xmath106 is the service time of the customer that initiated the busy period , @xmath107 is the number of poisson arrivals during this service time and the @xmath108 s are independent and distributed as @xmath105 .",
    "we refer to @xcite and other books on queueing theory for more details . also , see zwart  @xcite for an excellent detailed treatment of queues with regular variation , and specifically the busy period problem .",
    "we note also that our equation ( [ e2 ] ) is a special case in a rich class of stochastic recursive equations that were discussed in detail in the recent survey by aldous and bandyopadhyay  @xcite .",
    "this concludes the model description . the next step will be to use our model for providing a rigorous explanation of the indicated connection between the distributions of the in - degree and the pagerank",
    "the idea of our analysis is to write the equation for the laplace - stieltjes transforms of @xmath59 and @xmath52 and then make use of the tauberian theorems to prove that @xmath52 is regularly varying with the same index as @xmath59 . according to theorem  [ t3 ] , this will give us the desired similarity in tail behavior of the pagerank @xmath52 and the in - degree @xmath58 .    as a result of the assumptions from section  [ model ] , we can express the laplace - stieltjes transform @xmath109 of the pagerank distribution @xmath52 in terms of the probability generating function of @xmath58 using ( [ e2 ] ) : @xmath110 since , by ( [ e14 ] ) , @xmath111 we arrive at @xmath112 it can be shown ( e.g. arguing as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  xiii.4 ) ) that equation ( [ e5 ] ) has a unique solution @xmath109 which is completely monotone and has @xmath113 if and only if @xmath114 .",
    "this inequality is satisfied for the typical values @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    as in section  [ section_nt ]",
    ", we will start the analysis with providing the correspondence between existence of the @xmath32-th moments of @xmath59 and @xmath52 .",
    "we remind that @xmath72 denote the first @xmath32 moments of @xmath59 .",
    "further , denote the first @xmath32 moments of @xmath52 by @xmath117 , and define @xmath118 as in ( [ ndef ] ) . note that taking expectations on both sides of ( [ e2 ] ) we easily obtain @xmath119 .",
    "this follows from the independence of @xmath58 and the @xmath56 s and the fact that @xmath120 .",
    "the next lemma holds .",
    "[ l1 ] the following are equivalent    * @xmath40 , * @xmath121 .",
    "we use induction , starting from @xmath122 for which both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are valid .",
    "assume that for @xmath125 it has been shown that @xmath126 .",
    "we introduce the following notation , to be used throughout this section .",
    "denote @xmath127 then we can write ( [ e5 ] ) as @xmath128 we know from @xmath123 that @xmath129 thus , from ( [ e6 ] ) we obtain @xmath130 however , it follows from the induction hypothesis for @xmath131 that @xmath132 so we can present @xmath133 as a sum @xmath134 using this , we can actually find @xmath135 : @xmath136 for @xmath137 and appropriate constants @xmath138 thus , we obtain by ( [ e7 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) : @xmath139 for appropriate constants @xmath140 .",
    "using the expansion of @xmath141 , it is not difficult to show that for appropriate constants @xmath142 we also have @xmath143 in other words , because of the uniqueness of the series expansion , we have @xmath144 we will now show that this implies @xmath124 , to which end we consider the partial sums @xmath145 taking the limit as @xmath146 , we have for the last term that @xmath147 where we used the induction hypothesis @xmath148 together with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "it follows that we can express @xmath151 as an infinite sum , @xmath152 where we can apply ( [ e11 ] ) to each of the terms .",
    "further , by definition of @xmath153 , for all @xmath154 , there exists a @xmath155 such that @xmath156 whenever @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , for this @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and @xmath157 , we also have @xmath160 here the second inequality holds because @xmath161 for every @xmath162 . since for every @xmath163 there exists @xmath164 such that @xmath165 for @xmath166 , then according to ( [ delta ] ) , we have @xmath167 whenever @xmath168 , by which we have shown that @xmath169    assume that there exists a nonnegative random variable @xmath52 satisfying ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "then , obviously , @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , ( [ e2 ] ) also implies that @xmath52 is stochastically greater than @xmath171 .",
    "hence , the existence of the @xmath32-th moment of @xmath52 ensures the existence of the @xmath32-th moment of @xmath58 , which in turn by lemma  [ l3 ] ensures the existence of the @xmath32-th moment of @xmath59 .    note",
    "that the stochastic inequality @xmath172 implies that the tail of the pagerank is at least as heavy as the tail of the in - degree .",
    "similar as in remark  [ n1 ] , we can reformulate lemma [ l1 ] as @xmath173    from the first part of the proof of lemma  [ l1 ] we also obtain the next corollary .",
    "the following holds : @xmath174 [ co1 ]    by definitions of @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath133 and lemma  [ l1 ] , it follows from ( [ e6 ] ) that for fixed @xmath32 , @xmath177    because @xmath178 we can extend ( [ e8 ] ) for @xmath137 and appropriate constants @xmath179 : @xmath180 and rewrite the last equation as @xmath181 @xmath182 where @xmath183 are corresponding constants . now due to the uniqueness of the series expansion , we can reduce the above formula to @xmath184 then we get : @xmath185    now we are ready to explain the similarity between the in - degree and the pagerank distributions .",
    "the next theorem formalizes this main statement .",
    "the following are equivalent    * @xmath186 * @xmath187    [ t2 ]    from @xmath123 and theorem  [ t3 ] it follows that @xmath188 theorem  [ appth ] also implies that ( [ e17 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath189 , where @xmath190 as @xmath81 .",
    "then , by corollary [ co1 ] we obtain @xmath191 then also for every @xmath192 , as @xmath81 , we have @xmath193 and from the infinite - sum representation ( [ e16 ] ) for @xmath151 , we directly obtain @xmath194 now we again apply theorem  [ appth ] , which leads to @xmath124 .",
    "the proof follows easily from @xmath124 and corollary  [ co1 ] .",
    "thus , we have shown that the asymptotic behavior of the pagerank and the in - degree differ only by the multiplicative factor @xmath195 whereas the power law exponent remains the same . in the next section",
    "we will experimentally verify this result .",
    "the identification and measuring of power law behavior is not always simple . in this section",
    "we provide a brief overview of techniques that we used to plot and numerically identify power law distributions .",
    "the standard strategy is to plot a histogram of a quantity on logarithmic scales to obtain a straight line , which is a typical feature of the power law .",
    "however , this technique is often not efficient . in  @xcite ,",
    "newman clearly illustrated that even for generated random numbers with a known distribution the noise in the tail region has a strong influence on the estimation of the power law parameters .",
    "he suggests to plot the fraction of measurements that are not smaller than a given value , i.e. the complementary cumulative distribution function @xmath196 rather than the histogram .",
    "the advantage is that we obtain a less noisy plot . besides",
    ", this idea is consistent with our analysis in the previous section , which was based on complementary cumulative distribution functions .",
    "we note that if the distribution of @xmath26 follows a power law with exponent @xmath7 so that @xmath197 , @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is some constant , then the corresponding histogram has an exponent @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the plot of @xmath201 on logarithmic scales has a smaller slope than the plot of the histogram .",
    "computing the correct slope from the observed data is also not trivial .",
    "goldstein et al . in @xcite , and later newman in @xcite , have proposed to use maximum likelihood estimation , which provides a more robust estimation of the power law exponent than the standard least - squares fit method .",
    "thus , we compute the exponent @xmath7 using the next formula from  @xcite : @xmath202 here the quantities @xmath203 , @xmath204 , are the measured values of @xmath26 , and @xmath205 usually corresponds to the smallest value of @xmath26 for which the power law behavior is assumed to hold .    in the next sections we will present our experiments on real web data and on a graph that represents a well - known mathematical model of the web ( growing networks ) . in both cases , for each value @xmath8 , we plot in log - log scale the number of measurements that are not smaller than @xmath8 , and we use ( [ e18 ] ) to obtain the exponents .",
    "to confirm our results on asymptotic similarity between pagerank and in - degree distributions we performed experiments on the public data of the stanford web from @xcite .",
    "we calculated the pageranks over a web graph with @xmath206 nodes ( pages ) and @xmath207 million edges ( links ) using the standard power method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are several papers , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , that describe similar experiments for different domains and different number of pages , and they all confirm that the pagerank and the in - degree follow power laws with the same exponent , around 2.1 . in figure  [ web ] we show the log - log plots for the in - degree and the pagerank of the stanford web data , for different values of the damping factor ( @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) .",
    "clearly , these empirical values of in - degree and pagerank constitute parallel straight lines for all values of the damping factor , provided that the pagerank values are reasonably large .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that in general , the pagerank depends on the damping factor but the pagerank of the top 10% of pages obeys a power law with the same exponent as the in - degree , independent on the damping factor .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with our experimental results and the mathematical model , which is focused on the right tail behavior of the pagerank distribution .",
    "the calculations based on the maximum likelihood method yield a slope @xmath210 for each of the lines , which verifies that the in - degree and pagerank have power laws with the same exponent @xmath211 ( which corresponds to the well known value @xmath10 for the histogram ) .",
    "more precisely , we fitted the lines @xmath212 , and @xmath213 for the plots of the in - degree and pageranks with @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , respectively .",
    "we also investigated whether theorem  [ t2 ] correctly predicts the multiplicative factor @xmath217 in figure  [ diff ] we plotted @xmath218 and we compared it to the observed differences between the logarithms of the complementary cumulative distribution functions of the pagerank and the in - degree , for different values of the damping factor . here @xmath219 as in the web data .",
    "we see that theoretical and observed values are remarkably close .",
    "thus , our model not only allows to prove the similarity in the power law behavior but also gives a good approximation for the difference between the two distributions .",
    "the discrepancy between the predicted and observed values of the multiplicative factor suggests that our model does not capture the pagerank behavior to the full extent .",
    "for instance , the assumption of the independence of the pagerank of pages that have a common neighbor may be too strong .",
    "we believe however that the achieved precision , especially for small values of @xmath6 , is quite good for our relatively simple stochastic model .",
    "growing networks , introduced by barabsi and albert @xcite , now represent a large class of models that are commonly accepted as a possible scenario of web growth .",
    "in particular , these models provide a mathematical explanation for the power law behavior of the in - degree  @xcite .",
    "the recent studies @xcite , @xcite addressed for the first time the pagerank distribution in growing networks .",
    "growing network models are characterized by preferential attachment .",
    "this entails that a newly created node connects to the existing nodes with probabilities that are proportional to the current in - degrees of the existing nodes .",
    "we simulated a slightly modified version of this model , where a new link points to a randomly chosen page with probability @xmath220 , and with probability @xmath221 the preferential attachment selection rule is used .",
    "this allows us to tune the exponent of the resulting power law  @xcite .",
    "we simulate our growing network using matlab .",
    "we start with @xmath53 nodes and at each step we add a new node that links to @xmath53 already existing nodes .",
    "to ensure the same number of outgoing links for all pages , at the end of the simulation , we link the first @xmath53 nodes to randomly chosen pages . in the example presented below we set @xmath222 and obtain a network of @xmath223 nodes with out - degree @xmath224 .    in figure  [ picturegrnet ]",
    "we present the numerical data for the in - degree and the pagerank in the growing network .",
    "clearly , the web data from section  [ sec : wd ] shows a much better agreement with our model than the data generated by the preferential attachment algorithm . in the next section",
    "we briefly compare recent results on the pagerank in growing networks to our present study and we indicate possible directions for further research .",
    "our model and analysis resulted in the conclusion that the pagerank and the in - degree should follow power laws with the same exponent .",
    "growing network models may provide an alternative explanation  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the recent paper by avrachenkov and lebedev  @xcite it was shown that the _ expected _ pagerank in growing networks follows a power law with an exponent , which does depend on the damping factor but equals @xmath225 for @xmath226 .",
    "thus , the model in @xcite can also be used to explain the tail behavior of the pagerank , but it leads to a slightly different result than our model because in our case the power law exponent of the pagerank does _ not _ depend on the damping factor .",
    "the reason could be that we focus only on the asymptotics , whereas @xcite employs a mean - field approximation .",
    "indeed , experiments show that the shape of the pagerank distribution does depend on the damping factor , and thus , it may affect the average values , whereas the tail behavior remains the same for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "we emphasise that compared to @xcite , our model provides a completely different approach for modelling the relation between the in - degree and the pagerank .",
    "specifically , we do not make any assumption on the underlying web graph , whereas @xcite choose for the preferential attachment structure , thus exploiting the fact that this graph model correctly captures the in - degree distribution .",
    "we believe that both approaches should be elaborated and used in further research on the pagerank distribution .",
    "one of the important innovations in the present work is the analogy between the pagerank equation and the equation for the busy period that enables us to apply the techniques from @xcite .",
    "in fact , queueing systems with heavy tails and in particular the busy period problem allow for a more sophisticated probabilistic analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to apply these advanced methods to the problems related to the world wide web and pagerank .",
    "our model definitely lacks the dependencies between the pageranks of the pages sharing a common neighbor .",
    "such dependencies must be present in the web in particular due to the high clustering of the web graph  @xcite ( roughly speaking , clustering means that with high probability , two neighbors of the same page are connected to each other ) .",
    "thus , in our further research we could try to include some sort of dependencies in our stochastic equation .",
    "another natural way to bring our model closer to the real - life situation is to allow random ( heavy - tailed ) out - degrees",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate in which ways these new features will affect the pagerank asymptotics ."
