    "over the past decade , many important b physics measurements were performed at z factories ( lep , slc ) .",
    "the large boost of b hadrons gives access to important properties ( _ e.g. _  lifetimes , oscillation frequencies of neutral b mesons ) , which can not be studied with b hadrons at rest .",
    "today asymmetric b factories are taking over for what concerns the physics of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons , while our experimental knowledge of @xmath4 and b baryon physics is still based on measurements performed by the lep experiments and sld , and by cdf at the tevatron . a major step forward in these topics will be made only when significant statistics from the tevatron run ii are analyzed . in this review emphasis",
    "is given to studies of b decay properties rather than b hadron production ; in particular to measurements that are related to the determination of ckm matrix elements , and hence to the description of cp violation in the standard model .",
    "first , results on b hadron lifetimes are reviewed .",
    "the inclusive b lifetime is an input parameter for the derivation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the inclusive semileptonic branching ratios , while individual b - hadron lifetimes provide an important test of our understanding of hadron dynamics .",
    "the lifetime difference in the @xmath4 system is now also measured ; the ratio to the oscillation frequency can be calculated on the lattice .",
    "next , measurements of inclusive semileptonic b decay rates are presented , which give the opportunity to derive @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "an alternative determination of @xmath0 is provided by the study of @xmath5 exclusive decays .",
    "finally , studies of neutral b meson oscillations yield information on @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "most of the results presented are based on analyses from the lep experiments and sld .",
    "the lep i data sample consists of almost four million hadronic decays per experiment .",
    "sld has collected a sample 10 times smaller than that of each lep experiment , but is competitive on some specific analyses , due to some unique features of the accelerator and the detector .",
    "the polarization of the electron beam , the tiny and stable beam spot and the excellent precision of the ccd vertex detector significantly enhance the quark charge tagging capability , the precision in the track impact paremeter and b decay length measurements , and the efficiency in inclusive secondary vertex finding .",
    "measurements of the inclusive b lifetime are based on semileptonic or fully inclusive final states , either measuring the impact parameter of charged particle tracks , or the decay length of inclusively reconstructed secondary vertices .",
    "individual b hadron lifetimes are measured with several techniques .",
    "the most precise results come from reconstruction of semileptonic final states and from inclusive reconstruction of secondary vertices , particularly suitable for @xmath3 mesons .",
    "the averages of results from cdf , sld and the lep experiments are shown in fig .  [ fig.life]a ; the ratio of individual lifetimes to the @xmath2 lifetimes are compared with theoretical predictions@xcite in fig .",

    "the predicted hyerarchy is observed .",
    "the difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 lifetimes is established experimentally at more than @xmath8 .",
    "a discrepancy between measurement and prediction of about @xmath8 emerges for the b baryon lifetime .",
    "new measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 lifetimes are now coming from the asymmetric b factories : the precision of the results presented here is expected to be exceeded by the end of 2001 . for @xmath4 and b baryon lifetimes ,",
    "no significant improvement is to be expected from new analyses of the available data samples .",
    "the discrepancy between theory and experiments for the b baryon lifetime has triggered new theoretical studies .",
    "neubert@xcite has performed an analysis with less modelling assumptions , varying the unknown hadronic matrix elements within plausible ranges .",
    "the predictivity for the hyerarchy between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is lost , and the low measured value of the baryon lifetime is still difficult to accommodate .",
    "analyses based on qcd sum rules@xcite also give a prediction higher than the measurement , although huang  _ et al._@xcite , by stretching some assumptions , have been able to produce a low value , @xmath9 , in better agreement with the experimental determination .",
    "several methods have been explored by the lep experiments and cdf to constrain the lifetime difference in the @xmath4 system .",
    "the simplest analyses are based on the observation that fitting for the @xmath4 lifetime in inclusive samples , or samples of semileptonic @xmath4 decays , yields a result which takes a second order correction from a possible lifetime difference bewteen the two @xmath4 states . assuming that the @xmath4 and @xmath2 decay widths are equal ( @xmath10 ) , the result can be translated to a constraint on the lifetime difference .",
    "alternatively , the selection can be aimed at enhancing the @xmath4 short content of the sample analysed . in this case",
    "the fraction of @xmath4 short has to be evaluated , and the sensitivity of the fitted lifetime to the lifetime difference is higher . finally , aleph tried to select @xmath11 final states , corresponding to @xmath4 short decays , by selecting jets containing two reconstructed @xmath12 mesons .",
    "fitting for the lifetime of this sample yields a direct measurement of the @xmath4 short lifetime .",
    "in addition , since this final state is the only significant contribution to the width difference , a measurement of the rate can also be translated to a constraint on the lifetime difference .",
    "all these methods yield rather mild constraints on the @xmath4 lifetime difference , but combining the likelihood profiles from all the analyses , together with the contraint @xmath10 , gives the result reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.dgs ] , which can be quantified either as a measurement or as a 95% c.l .",

    "the inclusive direct semileptonic decay rate of b hadrons @xmath15 is measured by the lep experiments .",
    "high - purity b hadron samples are obtained by applying a lifetime tagging in the opposite event - half , while a reliable knowledge of the lepton identification and background is achieved thanks to several control samples which allow the simulation to be precisely tuned with the data .",
    "the challenge of these analyses is to disentangle the various sources of prompt leptons in b decays , in particular direct @xmath16 from cascade @xmath17 decays , keeping control of the related systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measurements available are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.btol ] , together with the average .",
    "two new results from aleph have been recently released , obtained with methods that have largely independent systematic uncertainties .",

[ eq.vcb ] . the @xmath15 result from lep",
    "can also be compared with the @xmath21 value , after correcting for the different b hadron mixture .",
    "assuming equal semileptonic widths for all b species , the correction can be written as @xmath22 which compares rather well with the value measured by cleo@xcite @xmath23    an alternative determination of @xmath0 is provided by the study of exclusive @xmath5 decays .",
    "the decay rate can be written as a function of the @xmath24 boost in the @xmath25 rest frame @xmath26 , as@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a phase space factor and @xmath29 is an unknown hadronic form factor . in",
    "the infinite b quark mass limit , the hadronic form factor equals unity for a @xmath24 at rest ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "mass and non - perturbative corrections can be calculated with the operator product expansion formalism@xcite , obtaining @xmath31 . in the analyses the spectrum of the candidates as a function of the reconstucted @xmath26 is fit for the slope @xmath32 and the intecept at @xmath30 , @xmath33 , where the phase space vanishes .",
    "the results are averaged accounting for the correlation between the two free parameters , obtaining the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.vcb]a .",
    "the determintation from the exclusive channel is in perfect agreement with that from the inclusive @xmath16 rate , as shown in fig.[fig.vcb]b , where a global average is also presented .",
    "the lep experiments have also performed analyses of inclusive semileptonic decays , where charmed and charmless hadronic final states are discriminated on a statistical basis , producing measurements @xmath34 .",
    "discriminating variables are aimed at selecting low - mass hadronic states ; the task is complicated by the high multiplicity of fragmentation particles , which need to be disentangled from the b decay products .",
    "the analyses try to achieve the best possible separation between charmed and charmless final states by combining several discriminating variables by means of neural networks .",
    "nevertheless the signal is measured on top of a large background from @xmath35 transitions , which need to be subtracted ; the estimate of the related systematic uncertainties is the critical issue for these analyses . on the other hand , because the b hadron has a large boost , the selection has relatively small dependence upon the decay kinematics , and therefore upon the modelling of the signal . the results available and the lep average are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.bul ] .    similarly to eq .",
    "[ eq.vcb ] , the measured branching ratio can be used to extract the @xmath1@xcite according to @xmath36 which yields @xmath37 where the first error accounts for limited statistics and detector effects , the second and third come from the modelling of @xmath35 and @xmath18 transitions , respectively , and the last reflects the uncertainty in eq .",
    "[ eq.vub ] .",
    "the oscillation frequency in the @xmath38 system , which is proportional to the mass difference of the two eigenstates , can be translated to a measurement of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , yielding a constraint on the size of the cp violating phase @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately qcd effects are large and the associated uncertainty dominates the extraction of @xmath42 .",
    "a better constraint on @xmath41 could be obtained from the ratio of the oscillation frequencies of @xmath4 and @xmath2 mesons , since some of the qcd uncertainties cancel in the ratio .",
    "the factor @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] is estimated to be known at the @xmath44 level .",

    "the proper time is derived from the measured decay length and the reconstructed momentum of the decaying meson .",
    "the resolution on the decay length @xmath47 is to first order independent of the decay length itself , and is largely determined by the tracking capabilities of the detector .",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath48 depends strongly on the final state chosen for a given analysis , and is typically proportional to the momentum itself .",
    "the proper time resolution can be therefore written as : @xmath49 where the decay length resolution contributes a constant term , and the momentum resolution a term proportional to the proper time .",
    "examples of the resulting observable difference are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] , for the simple case of monochromatic @xmath25 mesons of momentum @xmath50 , resolutions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( gaussian ) , and for different values of the true oscillation frequency . for low frequency several periods can be observed .",
    "as the frequency increases , the effect of the finite proper time resolution becomes more relevant , inducing an overall decrease of observed difference , and a faster damping as a function of time ( due to the momentum resolution component ) . in the example given , for a frequency of @xmath53 only a small effect corresponding to the first half - period can be seen .",
    "the first step for a @xmath25 meson oscillation analysis is the selection of final states suitable for the study .",
    "the choice of the selection criterion determines also the strategy for the tagging of the meson flavour at decay time .",
    "then , the flavour at production time is tagged , to give the global mistag probability . finally , the proper time is reconstructed for each meson candidate , and the oscillation is studied by means of a likelihood fit to the distributions of decays tagged as mixed or unmixed .",
    "several measurements of the @xmath2 oscillations frequency have been produced by the lep experiments , sld and cdf .",
    "a variety of selection methods have been used , offering different advantages in terms of statistics , signal purity and control of the systematic uncertainties . the average per experiment , and the global average are shown in fig .  [ fig.dmd ] .",
    "all the analyses rely on the simulation to some extent , and therefore are affected by uncertainties in the physics processes that are simulated .",
    "the results are adjusted to a common set of input parameters ( _ e.g. _  b hadron lifetimes and production fractions ) and then averaged , deriving the result of fig .",
    "[ fig.dmd ] and the following values for the b hadron production fractions : @xmath54    in the case of @xmath4 oscillations , the analyses currently available have not been able to resolve the oscillation and produce a measurement of the frequency ; only certain ranges of frequencies have been excluded .",
    "combining such excluded ranges is not straightforward , and a specific method , the _ amplitude method _ , was introduced for this purpose@xcite . in the likelihood fit to the proper time distribution of decays tagged as mixed or unmixed , the frequency of the oscillation is not taken to be the free parameter , but it is instead fixed to a `` test '' value @xmath26 .",
    "an auxiliary parameter , the amplitude @xmath55 of the oscillating term is introduced , and left free in the fit .",
    "the proper time distributions for mixed and unmixed decay , prior to convolution with the experimental resolution , are therefore written as @xmath56 \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath26 the test frequency and @xmath55 the only free parameter .",
    "when the test frequency is much smaller than the true frequency ( ) the expected value for the amplitude is . at the true frequency ( )",
    "the expectation is .",
    "all the values of the test frequency @xmath26 for which are excluded at @xmath57  c.l .",
    "when @xmath26 approaches or exceeds the true frequency @xmath58 , the shape of @xmath59 depends on the details of the analysis and can be calculated analytically in simple cases@xcite .",
    "the amplitude has well - behaved errors , and different measurements can be combined in a straightforward way , by averaging the amplitude measured at different test frequencies .",
    "the excluded range is derived from the combined amplitude scan .    at present the world combination",
    "is dominated at high frequency by the analyses of aleph and sld . the amplitude spectrum , with statistical and systematic errors is shown in fig .  [ fig : dms]a . a lower limit of is derived , while the expected limit ( sensitivity ) is .",
    "the difference is due to the positive amplitude values measured around , compatible with one , as expected in the presence of signal .",
    "the error on the amplitude at high frequency ( ) is reduced by about a factor of two compared to the world combination of summer 1999 , mostly because of improvements in the analysis techniques .",
    "some improvements are still expected both from the the lep experiments and sld .",
    "the amplitude spectrum can be translated to a log - likelihood profile , referred to the asymptotic value for ( fig.[fig : dms]b ) .",
    "a minimum is observed at @xmath60 .",
    "the deviation of the measured amplitude from @xmath61 around the likelihood minimum is about @xmath62 .",
    "such a value can not be used to assess the probability of a fluctuation , since it is chosen _ a posteriori _ among all the points of the frequency scan performed . on the other hand because the amplitude measurements at different frequencies are correlated , the probability of observing a minimum as or more incompatible with the hypothesis of background than the one found in the data , needs to be estimated with toy experiments@xcite .",
    "such a probability is found to be about @xmath63 .",
    "an interesting issue is to which extent the observation is compatible with the hypothesis of signal .",
    "this can not be assessed quantitatively in a non - trivial way . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl ] the expected amplitude shapes , calculated analytically@xcite , are shown for the simple case of monochromatic @xmath4 mesons of @xmath64 which oscillates with a frequency of @xmath65 , with different ( gaussian ) resolutions in momentum and decay length .",

    "many analyses contribute , which have widely different momentum and decay length resolution . in the most sensitive analyses ,",
    "even , each event enters with its specific estimated resolutions , therefore contributing with a different expected amplitude shape .",
