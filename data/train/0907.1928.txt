    "the stacks are then made from the highest - quality data taken in each year as part of cfht - ls : all individual images entering the stacks have seeing @xmath25 fwhm .",
    "the resampled frames that pass this cut are combined using a weighted average , with a @xmath26 clipping to remove artifacts such as satellite trails and cosmic - rays .",
    "typical exposure times for the final stacked images range from 10,000 seconds ( in @xmath22 ) to 50,000 seconds ( in @xmath24 ) .",
    "we combine the `` seasonal - stacked '' images from all four years into `` super - stacked '' images to colour - select high - redshift galaxies . in this manner",
    "we reach deeper than the `` seasonal - stacked '' images alone and are able determine galaxy colours with photometric uncertainties @xmath27 mag for galaxies to m@xmath28 .",
    "we detect sources in the field using _ sextractor _  @xcite software and use the segmentation map generated from the `` super - stacked '' images to monitor the flux of selected galaxies year - to - year in the `` seasonal - stacked '' images .",
    "the higher sensitivity of the `` super - stacked '' images enable a more complete pixel definition of the luminous extent of each galaxy for optimal reference segmentation maps .",
    "in addition , the combination of four seasons effectively dilutes any potential colour contribution to the host galaxy as a result of part or all of a sn event that may affect the colour selection .",
    "we note that @xmath2 sne iin are detectable in the cfht - ls data for @xmath12 months , observed - frame .",
    "any significant contribution from a detectable sn would result in a net flat or bluer addition the host galaxy colour in a given `` seasonal - stacked '' image and our colour criteria include the bluest galaxies . a somewhat redder sn contribution in",
    "the uv would come from the fraction of an event caught after peak brightness which would in turn be quite faint in integrated light in the particular `` seasonal - stacked '' image and thereby contribute very little to the four - season `` super - stacked '' image .",
    "we filter @xmath29 galaxies from the detected sources using a colour - selection technique specifically designed for the cfht megacam .",
    "we determine the colours of 10 different galaxy templates evolved from @xmath30 to high redshift by convolving the templates with ( 1 ) the throughput of the cfht megacam @xmath10 filters , ( 2 ) the megacam ccd quantum efficiency , ( 3 ) the atmospheric extinction of mauna kea , and ( 4 ) an adopted high - redshift prescription  @xcite for the expected decrement of flux shortward of and the lyman limit as a result of intervening systems and intrinsic absorption .",
    "we use the spectroscopic catalogue of the vi(r)mos - vlt deep survey ( vvds )  @xmath31 to test our cfht - ls colour selection criteria and find that @xmath32% of the galaxies common to both surveys that have both vvds high - confidence redshift qualifiers and that meet our colour criteria have redshifts @xmath33 .",
    "the colour cuts that isolate @xmath2 and @xmath34 galaxies result in redshift distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ( there are too few galaxies for a meaningful distribution for our @xmath37 colour cuts ) .",
    "we monitor all sources that meet these color criteria and consider a relaxed color cut that includes @xmath33 sources .",
    "sne iin have a magnitude distribution @xmath38  @xmath39 and uv luminosities @xmath40 magnitude fainter near peak brightness  @xmath41@xcite .",
    "sne template analyses show that @xmath42% of all sn detections at @xmath43 are expected to be sne iin  @xmath44 as a result of their strong intrinsic uv luminosity .",
    "we searched the cfht - ls data for events are that meet the criteria discussed in the main letter that includes a @xmath26 flux variation over the host galaxy flux in each of the @xmath17 filters .",
    "of the initial four @xmath2 sn candidates , two sn events ( sn 234161 and sn 19941 ) meet the @xmath45 and @xmath46 colour - selection and the remaining two events ( sn 219241 and sn 352912 ) meet relaxed colour cuts that select galaxies with redshifts above @xmath47 . follow - up spectroscopy (  [ spectra ] ) of sn 234161 and sn 19941 confirmed host redshifts of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , we have obtained spectroscopy of sn 219241 and find the host redshift to be @xmath50 . from the above results and the efficiency of our colour selection , we expect the sn 352912 to have a high likelihood to be a @xmath29 event .",
    "the sne discussed in the main letter are detected at the following significance above their host galaxy flux in the @xmath51 and @xmath24 seasonal - stacked images , respectively , sn 219241 : @xmath52 ; sn 234161 : @xmath53 ; and sn 19941 : @xmath54 .",
    "these are determined using the sn integrated magnitudes in the seasonal - stacked images and are @xmath55 magnitudes fainter in a given filter as compared to the peak magnitudes determined from the light curves .",
    "figure  [ rimages ] displays the @xmath23-band images of the three sne .",

    "the subtracted images for both seasons are also shown .",
    "the seasons that do not include the sne help to illustrate the clean subtraction possible with the high - quality cfht - ls images .",
    "the sne are immediately obvious in the seasons with detections and have measurable offsets from their host galaxy centroids .",
    "the subtracted images are similar in the @xmath22 and @xmath24-bands , as suggested by the detection significance above , and the sn offsets from their host galaxy flux centroids are consistent for each event filter to filter .    the seeing in the `` seasonal - stacked '' images is found to be @xmath56 fwhm and stable across the images and over the four epochs .",
    "we subtracted the average flux of the `` seasonal - stacked '' images from the combined three adjacent years to construct the subtracted images .",
    "the three sne exhibit clean radial profiles with fwhms equivalent to that of nearby point sources in the field .",
    "the pixel scale of the cfht megacam is @xmath57 pixel@xmath58 and corresponds to @xmath59 kpc , physical , over @xmath60 .",
    "as listed in table 1 of the main letter , the sne have @xmath61 kpc separations from their host galaxy centroids .",
    "we tested the accuracy of these separations by measuring the centroids of a galaxy sample that includes the sn host galaxies and galaxies with similar magnitude .",
    "we determined that the centroid measurements are accurate to @xmath62 pixels , @xmath63 , in images tested season - to - season and @xmath64 pixels , @xmath63 , when tested filter - to - filter for a given season .",
    "the sn centroids in the subtracted images were tested in an identical manner and found to be accurate to @xmath65 pixels , @xmath63 , filter - to - filter in their respective outburst season . we conclude that the sn - host centroid separations are accurate to @xmath66 pixels , @xmath63 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath67 using the cfht - ls plate scale and @xmath68 kpc for the range of sn redshifts presented here .",
    "we performed an additional test of the separations between the centroids of known agn and their host galaxies .",
    "these are agn found to exhibit a flux variation during the seasons probed by the cfht - ls data and have host galaxies @xmath69 magnitudes brighter than the host galaxies tested above .",
    "we find the separations accurate to @xmath70 pixels , @xmath63 .",
    "although we expect the centroid uncertainties to behave as a function of magnitude , this test provides a sense of the separation uncertainty for known agn in host galaxies with relatively similar magnitudes and demonstrates the quality of the cfht - ls imaging dataset . as a result ,",
    "the measured sn separations from their host galaxy centroids are real , however sn 19941 is only significant to @xmath71 .",
    "the flux evolution for each of the three @xmath2 sne is presented in figure 1 of the main letter and the magnitude information for the @xmath72 filters is listed in table  [ snmags ] below .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute magnitudes are dominated by the photometry with a negligible contribution from the uncertainties in redshift . the strong detection and evolution of flux in the @xmath17 filters , that probe the rest - frame uv for these sne , places immediate constraints on their classification .",
    "first , type ia sne show very little flux shortward of @xmath73 nm from efficient scattering of uv photons  @xmath74 and would be below the sensitivity of the seasonal - stacked images at @xmath75 .",
    "this rules out a type ia sne for these events .",
    "second , type ib / c and type ii sne , other than sne iin , have luminosities too low , and/or that rise and decline too rapidly and remain essentially flat  @xmath76 in the uv as compared to that observed for sn 219241 , sn 234161 and sn 19941 .",
    "instead , the peak uv magnitudes and evolution of are consistent with those of sne iin .",
    "we tested the intrinsic uv luminosity of all sn types and find that @xmath77% of all @xmath78 detections in the cfht - ls @xmath22-band data are expected to be sne iin .",
    "table  [ decay ] lists the flux decay rates for each sn .",
    "the rest - frame bandpasses that correspond to the observed @xmath79 and @xmath24-band filters for each sn are arbitrarily indicated as uv1 , uv2 , and uv3 , respectively .",
    "sne iin have varying decay rates in the optical , but are essentially cooling blackbodies in the uv at early times .",
    "we use the expectations of a low extinction , cooling blackbody guided by the uv continuum evolution of sn 1998s  @xmath80 to generate a model for the sne iin uv decay rates .",
    "we compute the rest - frame bandpass of the observations for each sn and the expected decay rate considering the appropriate time dilation .",
    "the relevant values of the model are also listed in table  [ decay ] .",
    "the sne closely follow the uv decay rate expectations of the model events at the determined redshifts",
    ". moreover , these values are in close agreement to the publicly available @xmath81 uvot data of sn 2007pk and sn 2008am _ ( http://heasarc.nasa.gov / docs / swift / sne / swift_sn.html)_.",
    "we obtained low - resolution spectroscopy of sn 219241 and sn 234161 at the w. m. keck observatory ( keck ) on 30 september 2008 and 01 october 2008 .",
    "we used the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos )  @xmath82 with the 600 line mm@xmath58 grating and a multi - object spectroscopic wavelength coverage of @xmath83 nm . we acquired three 1200s exposures of sn 219241 and five 1200s exposures of sn 234161 .",
    "the data were reduced using the ucb @xmath84 pipeline . because deimos is not sensitive below @xmath85 nm and because bright night sky emission lines begin to dominate the spectra longward of @xmath86 nm , the data were most effective in securing @xmath87 redshifts of the faint host galaxies from strong rest - frame optical features such as [ oii]@xmath88 372.7 nm and balmer features and @xmath89 redshifts from strong rest - frame uv features that include prominent and ism absorption features .",
    "objects with redshifts between @xmath90 fall in the `` redshift desert '' which is a range of redshift where galaxies exhibit flat continua and no strong identifying features in observed - frame optical wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , the uv absorption features over these rest - frame wavelengths have been well - studied and the characteristic flat continua help to make @xmath2 galaxy colour - selection very efficient  @xmath91@xcite .",
    "in addition to the deimos data , we obtained low - resolution spectroscopy of sn 19941 on 25 january 2009 using the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris )  @xmath92 at keck .",
    "we used the 400 line mm@xmath58 grism blazed at 340 nm and the 400 line mm@xmath58 grating blazed at 850 nm to utilise both the blue and red arms of lris .",
    "the excellent blue sensitivity of lris resulted in @xmath93 nm wavelength coverage .",
    "the data were reduced using conventional methods that include iraf and idl tasks and analysed with in - house code .",
    "figure  [ 1dspectra ] presents the deimos and lris spectra for the three high - redshift sne .",
    "the @xmath50 host galaxy of sn 219241 exhibits strong [ oii]@xmath88 372.7 emission and ca h&k absorption lines .",
    "sn 234161 host galaxy has a best fit redshift of @xmath48 from a cross - correlation of 23 ism absorption features that include siiv @xmath88 139.4 , 140.3 , civ @xmath88 154.8 , 155.1 , mgi @xmath88 202.6 , 285.2 , and feii @xmath88234.4 , 237.5 , 238.3 after omitting those near bright night sky emission lines .",
    "sn 19941 exhibits strong emission and is found to have a redshift of @xmath49 from a best fit to multiple ism absorption features .",
    "both sn 19941 and sn 234161 use a prescription  @xcite to estimate the systemic redshift of the host galaxy from the observed blueshifted ism features and redshifted emission as a result of galactic winds .",
    "the spectrum of sn 19941 shows a relatively broad emission line near rest - frame @xmath94 nm ( @xmath95 nm observed - frame ) and is discussed below .",
    "in  [ images ] and  [ lightcurves ] , we showed that the rest - frame uv photometry and light - curve evolution of the three sne best fit that of sne iin . to confirm this",
    ", we search the spectroscopy for evidence of the strong , long - lived emission lines that define the iin classification .",
    "the emission lines are expected to remain above the spectroscopic thresholds of 8m - class telescopes using @xmath96-hour exposures for @xmath97 years after outburst  @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , the emission lines peaks of sne iin can have a @xmath99 km s@xmath58 blueshift  @xmath80@xcite relative to the host galaxy velocity and evolve with time .",
    "this event was 855 days old , rest - frame , at the time observation . at this late stage , sne iin emission lines",
    "are expected to be near , or below , the threshold of detection with a @xmath96-hour observation .",
    "although the observing conditions were excellent ( @xmath100 seeing fwhm ) , our combined 3600s exposure was likely insufficient for significant emission - line detection .",
    "as a result , we do not have confident detection of sn line emission from sn 219241 .",
    "deeper optical or ir observations in the very near future may provide the sensitivity to detect sn emission or to rule out a iin classification . as a result",
    ", the iin classification is based on the uv photometry .",
    "we searched for sn iin emission line evidence in the combined 6000s exposure obtained under same excellent seeing conditions as sn 219241 .",

    "figure  [ lo ] is similar to figure 2 in the main letter but presents the spectrum of sn 234161 separated in bluer and redder wavelength regions for more detailed inspection . because the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the spectrum is only a few ( host galaxy m@xmath104 ) and the emission lines from the sn at such a high redshift are faint , we present a high - redshift galaxy composite spectrum and the spectrum of sn 1998s as an aid .",

    "some of the effects of the sn can be seen in ( 1 ) the continuum profile near 420 nm and the change in the siiv doublet line strength appearance in both the convolved spectrum and the data as a result of sn siiv emission , ( 2 ) the excess emission on a flat featureless section of the galaxy spectrum near 440 nm attributed to sn niv ] multiplet emission , ( 3 ) the continuum profile and excess flux near 460 nm attributed to sn civ emission and host galaxy siii and the civ absorption features , ( 4 ) excess flux near 525 nm attributed to sn niii ] emission , and ( 5 ) the clean detection of ciii ] and weaker siiii ] emission from the sn near 570 nm in the data .",

    "<S> because this method colour - selects a well - controlled population of galaxies over a well - defined volume , a small number of type iin supernovae can not only give the high - redshift rate of these supernovae , but also provide the first direct probe of the high redshift imf . </S>",
    "<S> for example , an evolving imf model invoked recently to reconcile indirect high- and low - redshift observations  @xcite predicts a greater number ( by a factor of @xmath19 ) of @xmath2 type iin supernovae than a locally measured imf  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> computing the expectations for the volume analysed to date , the confirmed type iin supernovae presented here are consistent with the relative number predicted using a static local imf . a relaxation of our conservative supernova criteria and a search for supernovae at greater radii from their host centroids in the complete cfht - ls dataset will test the validity of this result . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the method presented here provides a means to identify @xmath20 type iin supernovae at @xmath2 and to detect events to @xmath21 over the next ten years with 8-m - class deep synoptic optical campaigns , some of which are currently underway and some of which are soon to begin . </S>",
