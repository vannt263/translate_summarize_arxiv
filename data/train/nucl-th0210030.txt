    "@xcite showed how chiral symmetry constraints could be accommodated within a unitarity approach , able to describe resonances .",
    "this proved to be crucial to disentangle the intricate interaction between antikaons and nucleons at low energies  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to microscopically derive an optical potential for the @xmath0 in nuclear matter in a self - consistent manner .",
    "self - consistency turned out to be a crucial ingredient to derive the @xmath6-nucleus potential and led to an optical potential considerably more shallow than those found in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , the predictions of the chirally inspired potential of ref .",
    "@xcite for measured shifts and widths of @xmath0 atoms were evaluated , and it was found that this potential provides an acceptable description of the observed kaonic atom states , through the whole periodic table . despite of having both real and imaginary parts of quite different depth , some other empirical optical potentials ( @xcite@xcite ) also examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , led to acceptable descriptions of the experimentally available @xmath0 atom data as well .",
    "however , there were appreciable differences among the predicted widths for deeply bound antikaon nuclear states , not detected yet , when different potentials were used .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the possibility of differentiating between several @xmath0 nucleus optical potentials by means of the scattering data .",
    "the extrapolation to finite @xmath0 kinetic energies of the potential of ref .",
    "@xcite requires at least the inclusion of the @xmath7-wave part of the @xmath0 selfenergy .",
    "this was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and tested for @xmath8 scattering in ref .",
    "however , even after having included @xmath7-wave contributions , one can not expect reliable predictions from the theoretical potential of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , at the lowest energy for which there exist experimental data ( @xmath5 mev for the @xmath0 momentum ) , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 waves contributions are relevant .",
    "besides , as we will show , for this relatively high energy , the impulse approximation works reasonably well , which is a clear indication that these data do not have much information on the details of the @xmath0-nucleus dynamics .",
    "thus , we have also focused our attention at the typical momentum of the @xmath0 after the @xmath11-meson decay ( @xmath12 127 mev ) with the hope that the scattering experience could be performed at da@xmath13ne or at kek or in the future japanese hadron collider ( jhc ) .",
    "we solve the klein gordon equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the center of mass ( cm ) @xmath0nucleus energy , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the finite - size coulomb and optical @xmath0nucleus potentials and @xmath18 the reduced @xmath0-nucleus mass . at large distances and for a cm scattering angle @xmath19 , the @xmath0 wave - function @xmath20 behaves as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the standard wave functions for coulomb scattering from a punctual charge @xmath24 and @xmath25 the scattering amplitude , which normalization is determined by its relation to the cm differential elastic cross section @xmath26 .",
    "the integrated cross sections read : @xmath27 \\sigma_{\\rm t } & = & \\frac{2\\pi}{q^2 } \\sum_l ( 2l+1 ) \\left [ 1- \\eta_l \\cos\\left(2 \\left ( \\sigma_l+\\delta_l\\right)\\right ) \\right ] , \\label{eq : sr}\\\\[2 mm ] \\sigma_{\\rm re}&= & \\frac{\\pi}{q^2}\\sum_l ( 2l+1 ) \\left [ 1- \\eta_l^2\\right ] \\label{eq : st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 the cm @xmath0 momentum and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the standard coulomb phase shifts , the additional phase shifts due to strong interaction and the inelasticities appearing in the standard partial wave decomposition of @xmath25 ( see ref .",
    "while the elastic ( @xmath32 ) and total ( @xmath33 ) cross sections are infinite , the reaction ( @xmath34 ) cross section is finite because of the short - range of the nuclear interaction .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential , @xmath17 , is related to the @xmath0-selfenergy , @xmath35 inside of a nuclear medium , neglecting isovector effects , by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the @xmath0 mass and laboratory kinetic energy and @xmath39 is the sum of proton and neutron densities .    from the antikaon - selfenergy , as determined by , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , we define the first selfenergy used in this work ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this selfenergy does not have any free parameters , all the needed input is fixed either from studies of meson - baryon scattering in the vacuum or from previous studies of pion - nucleus dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it provides an acceptable ( @xmath41 of 2.9 ) description of the set of 63 shifts and widths of @xmath0 atom levels used in ref .",
    "we have neglected all type of non - localities , since they lead to changes in the results presented here of 3% at most .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also construct a modified selfenergy , which we call @xmath42 , by adding to @xmath43 a phenomenological part linear in density . this phenomenological part is determined by a constant @xmath44 which we fix to the value @xmath45 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a @xmath46-fit to the kaonic atom data .",
    "the new selfenergy reads : @xmath47 the third selfenergy considered in this work is just obtained from the impulse approximation ( ia ) , i.e. , @xmath48 form for the @xmath0 selfenergy , and it neglects all orders higher than the leading one , in the density expansion .",
    "it reads : @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 the nucleon mass , @xmath52 the total cm @xmath53 energy and @xmath54 the isoscalar and isovector forward antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes , which partial wave decomposition reads : @xmath55 with @xmath56 the total angular momentum . at threshold , @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the ia leads to extremely poor results for kaonic atoms  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this is a clear indication that higher density corrections , not taken into account within the ia , are extremely important for kaonic atoms .",
    "finally , we have also considered two other antikaon selfenergies fitted to the kaonic atom data and energy independent ( @xcite and  @xcite ) : @xmath58 \\pi^{\\rm iaph }   & = & - 4 \\pi \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\mu}{m}\\right ) { \\tilde b}_0 \\rho   \\label{eq : iaph } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as determined from @xmath46-fits to @xmath0-atom data in ref .",
    "note that , though both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are linear in density selfenergies , they lead to substantially different potentials , since the real parts of the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 differ both in sign and in size .",
    "since the @xmath0 lifetime is relatively small , in practical terms it is experimentally difficult to count with low energetic @xmath0 beams .",
    "however , all selfenergies described in the previous section , except for that obtained in the ia , are valid only near threshold .",
    "thus , we have studied the case @xmath66 mev , since this is the @xmath0 momentum after the @xmath11-meson decay .",
    "mev @xmath0 from @xmath1c , @xmath2ca and @xmath3pb with different @xmath0 selfenergies.,height=559 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp1 ] we present results obtained with the @xmath0 selfenergies fitted to the kaonic atom data .",
    "we also show results obtained by using the ia , where we have approximated the ia selfenergy at @xmath67 mev by its threshold value quoted above .",
    "strong interaction integrated elastic , reaction and total cross sections are also given in the top part of table  [ tab : comp1 ] .",
    "we obtain these cross sections after having got rid of the coulombian interaction , otherwise the total and elastic cross sections would diverge , i.e. , we compute strong phase - shifts and inelasticities ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) in presence of the coulomb interaction , and afterwards we set to zero the coulombian phase shifts , @xmath29 , in the formulae of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se])-([eq : st ] ) .",
    "mev @xmath0 from @xmath1c and @xmath2ca .",
    "data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,height=362 ]    .",
    "strong integrated elastic , reaction and total cross sections ( in mb ) at @xmath67 ( top ) and 300 ( bottom ) mev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as can be seen in the figure , the non - linear density dependent @xmath0 selfenergy , @xmath68 , and the linear density dependent , threshold ia selfenergy , @xmath69 , provide extraordinarily similar results . since both models have the same linear term in density ,",
    "this is a clear indication that the reaction takes place in the surface of the nuclei , because of the big imaginary part of the potentials .",
    "the semiphenomenological @xmath70 selfenergy , has a stronger departure from a linear behaviour in density than @xmath68 , it has a smaller imaginary part ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) and all of these explain the bigger differences with the ia model .",
    "results , in particular position of the minima , obtained with @xmath70 are clearly distinguishable from those obtained with any of the other three models also plotted in the figure , pointing out to a clear different density behavior likely due to the selfconsistent derivation of it . as a matter of example , for @xmath1c in the region around @xmath71 , 2dd , ia and iaph give similar elastic cross sections of about 33 mb / sr , whereas thph gives about 52 mb / sr .",
    "this difference is appreciable and the size of the cross sections , tens of mb / sr , might allow to measure such a difference at da@xmath13ne or kek or in the future at the jhc .",
    "the differences are even bigger for larger angles , around the minimum of the thph cross section ( region 110-@xmath72 ) , but there , the cross sections are smaller , which makes harder to get the required statistics to see the effect . besides , theoretical results in the neighborhood of a minimum are subject to more uncertainties .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn from the @xmath2ca and @xmath3pb results .",
    "in what respects to the integrated cross sections of table  [ tab : comp1 ] , 2dd and ia give similar cross sections , though the ia reaction cross section is always slightly bigger , because the imaginary part of the @xmath73 parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dd ] ) is negative .",
    "the iaph model always provides the biggest reaction cross sections , because its selfenergy has also the largest imaginary part among all models considered ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "thus one can differentiate two sets of models , i.e , 2dd and ia selfenergies from thph and iaph ones .",
    "besides , measurements , with precisions of about 10% , of the reaction cross sections would disentangle between thph and iaph models .",
    "let us look now to the experimental data .",
    "there only exist data  @xcite on @xmath0 differential elastic cross sections for @xmath74 mev and from @xmath1c and @xmath2ca . in fig .",
    "[ fig:800 ] we compare the ia predictions ( solid line ) , including up to @xmath75waves ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , to data .",
    "there also exist some data on total cross sections ( mb ) , @xmath76 [ @xmath77 ,  @xcite from @xmath1c at @xmath74 [ @xmath78 mev .",
    "the ia@xmath79 model provides again an acceptable description : 345 mb at 800 mev and 304 mb at 655 mev .",
    "thus , this region is less sensitive to in nuclear medium effects than the @xmath0 atom one .",
    "indeed , the glauber approximation also describes the 800 mev scattering data , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this work also corroborates that the imaginary part of the @xmath80 amplitude , obtained from the @xmath0-nucleus scattering data , is close to that deduced in the vacuum . besides",
    ", the contribution of @xmath9 and @xmath10 waves , not included in the thph model , turn out to be important ( compare the solid line to the ia results obtained when only @xmath81 and @xmath7 waves dot - dashed line are considered , in fig .",
    "[ fig:800 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for the @xmath81 and @xmath7 @xmath80 waves , though realistic near threshold , can not be safely extrapolated to momenta as high as 800 mev .",
    "thus , one expects the poor description of data provided by the thph model .",
    "it is however surprising , that the iaph predictions turn out to be almost indistinguishable from the ia@xmath79 ones .",
    "this is merely a coincidence and , it occurs since accidentally at this momentum , @xmath82 is approximately equal to @xmath64 .",
    "mev @xmath0 from @xmath1c , @xmath2ca and @xmath3pb with different @xmath0 selfenergies.,height=555 ]    to finish , we also present results at an intermediate @xmath0 momentum ( @xmath83 mev ) , despite the fact that there exist no data . for this momentum , calculations based on",
    "the ia shows that higher waves than the @xmath7 one have a small / moderate contribution and therefore can be neglected in some approximations .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] and bottom part of table  [ tab : comp1 ] , we compare again the thph , 2dd and iaph models for the @xmath0 selfenergy inside the nuclear medium , together with the ia results including up to the @xmath7-wave , or up to the @xmath9-wave ( partial waves are taken from ref .",
    "the first observation is that the 2dd model differs now more than for the @xmath4 mev momentum case , from the ia models .",
    "this is mainly due to the effect of @xmath7-wave in the latter ones .",
    "the second observation is that the semiphenomenological model thph leads to a pattern clearly different than the rest of selfenergies , not only for the elastic differential cross section but also in the integrated ones compiled in table  [ tab : comp1 ] .",
    "this is in principle good news , because then a scattering measurement in this region of @xmath0 momentum will be definitive to disentangle between this approach and the others considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] and bottom of table  [ tab : comp1 ] .",
    "however a word of caution must be said here , the @xmath81-wave part of the antikaon selfenergy of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a model for the @xmath80 scattering in the free space that , though it is quite successful near threshold , predicts amplitudes for the isoscalar channel around @xmath83 mev , with real parts which are in total disagreement ( in sign and in size , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the analysis of ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus , most probably one can not trust the thph model to describe the @xmath0-dynamics at this momentum .",
    "indeed , there is no reason either to believe more in the 2dd and iaph models , and we believe that the more reliable predictions for @xmath84 mev are those based on the ia .",
