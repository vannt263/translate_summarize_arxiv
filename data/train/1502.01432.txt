    "the fluctuations continue until there is a definite decay of the flare and the flux comes down below that same value , viz @xmath34 crab flux . in between , during the peak phase fluctuations , the flux can reach a value less than @xmath34 crab , and the parameter values of the inner disc is not discernible from the canonical black hole states .",

    "in addition , another class of lowest frequency qpo with a periodicity around 1 hz is observed on a few occasions , and only once it appears alone in the absence of the other two classes of qpos .",

    "for the twin qpo states both the peak rms as well as the significance shows large variation , but in general the peak rms of the lower frequency is equivalent or more than that of the higher frequency . the total flux measured from the source is more for twin qpo state except for the occasions when the higher frequency is in the range of 7 hz ( table [ tab_01 ] ) .

    "the frequency scales very strongly with the @xmath14 and inversely with the @xmath6 .",

    "intriguingly , the flux of the model components , however , are strongly anti - correlated to this frequency .",
    "given the results obtained in the previous sections , it is interesting to note the evolution of the structure of the accretion disc . starting from the quiescent state , the steady build up of both the flares 5a and 5b ( fig .",

    "this most likely leads to the qpo states when the applicability of the geometrically thin disc model becomes entirely infeasible .",
    "the temporal evolution may consist of the following stages .",
    "1 ) the shakura  sunyaev disc extends inwards beyond a certain threshold with the fall in @xmath14 and rise in @xmath6 .",
    "the thin disc emission reduces and the _ power law _ emission ( which can be called a non - thin - disc emission ) rises .",
    "the onset of single qpo state happens and as the @xmath14 falls the value of the single qpo frequency also falls while the @xmath6 rises along with the hardening of the _ power law _ component , and",
    "the _ diskbb _ flux correspondingly falls while there is a rise in the _ power law _",
    "2 ) the process may undergo a turn around and start evolving in the opposite direction , with a rise in @xmath14 and a corresponding fall in @xmath6 , in addition to all the other correlated changes in the parameters of the model and the qpo , resulting in the corresponding increase in the _ diskbb _ flux and decrease of the _ power law _ flux .",
    "3 ) with further change in the accretion and/or disc parameters in the single qpo state , the onset of the twin qpo state occurs .",
    "the spectral parameters behave similarly , albeit at a definite higher value of @xmath6 and lower value of @xmath14 , suggesting that the accretion disc extends further inwards . the _ power law _",
    "index @xmath7 remains within the narrow limit analogous to the single qpo state .",
    "but the _ power law _ flux does not depend on the spectral parameters , while the _ diskbb _ flux now anti - correlates with @xmath7 , the likely cause being the inner disc radius @xmath14 . here",
    "the higher frequency of the two qpos behaves somewhat similarly to the frequency of the single qpo state , i.e. it scales with the @xmath14 and inversely with @xmath6 , but the correlation of the frequency is highest with @xmath7 .",
    "it is the lower frequency that causes the system to behave in an inexplicable manner .",
    "the value of the frequency is anti - correlated with both the thin disc flux ( _ diskbb _ ) as well as the _ power law _ flux .",
    "4 ) the system may fluctuate within the twin qpo state with corresponding changes in the parameters and fluxes , or it might transit down to the single qpo state . from the single qpo state it might again make a transition to the twin qpo state or it may make the transition back to the canonical state as the flare dies down .    figs [ fig_02 ] and [ fig_03 ] ( bottom panel ) show very fast fluctuation of the x - ray emission during the peak phase of the flares 5a and 5b , and",
    "this feature is reflected in the spaced out data points of the qpo states in the @xmath14@xmath6 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig_05 ] ) .",
    "this fluctuation of the flux ( figs [ fig_02 ] & [ fig_03 ] ) occur independent of any change in the mass accretion rate as the slope of the log - log diagram of @xmath14@xmath6 ( fig .",

    "the fluctuation of luminosity may suggest some instability in the accretion disc causing the drastic fluctuation of the @xmath14 and @xmath6 along with the onset of the qpos , or else a fast physical mechanism is removing the mass from the inner disc close to the event horizon , resulting in the truncation of the disc and lowering of luminosity ( fig .",

    "eventhough the geometrically thin disc model is incapable of properly parametrizing the comparatively thicker slim disc parameters , but the total luminosity measured from the light curves ( 3 - 30 kev for pca and 1.512 kev for _ asm _ ) is independent of the spectral model , suggesting that the fluctuation of the disc is a real phenomenon .",
    "this evolution may perhaps indicate that the geometrically thin disc component is actually incapable of giving proper explanation of the spectral evolution , and the _ power law _",
    "component of the total flux may contain the emission actually originating from the thicker part of the slim disc .",

    "nevertheless , the failure of the comptonzation models to fit the energy spectral data with physically meaningful parameters suggests that the @xmath42 behavioural pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig_05 ] and [ fig_10 ] is qualitatively correct .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath6@xmath14 relationship and the model provided by @xcite provide the formation of slim disc as a very attractive physical option hitherto not explored .",
    "detailed physical mechanism of the thick accretion disc need to be modelled to explore the possible physical mechanisms that may give rise to the qpo phenomena ( namely diskosiesmology ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the possibility of x - ray emissions from the jet during the anomalous state @xcite requires the explanation of the possibility of the qpo phenomenon occurring in the outflow .",
    "the observed coincidence of the appearance of the qpos and the onset of slim disc , with or without the outflow emitting in x - rays , opens up many new possibilities in the modelling of the accretion disc for this source in particular and other black hole binary systems in general .",
    "the need of the hour is to develop a generalized multicoloured accretion disc model that would enable a smooth transition from the geometrically thin to the geometrically thicker , i.e. slim , disc , along with the emission from the out flowing jets .",
    "in this paper we report the onset of an anomalous accretion state during at least two of the many outbursts exhibited by the black hole binary system 4u 163047 .",
    "this anomalous state is very closely associated with the appearance of low frequency qpos .",
    "the source of the qpo during the unusual state needs to be explored theoretically .",
    "one possibility is the formation of shock in the transition region of the thermalized multicoloured geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disc and the comptonizing plasma cloud which is geometrically thick and optically thin .",
    "the other option is the change in the physical and geometrical state of the accretion disc and the thin disc transforming into a thick disc with increase in accretion rate .    for this source the outburst may consist of more than one flaring events .",
    "during each flaring event , the mass accretion is perhaps the most legitimate cause of the peak value of the flux measured from the flare .",
    "from the two outbursts covered ( 1998 and 2002 - 2004 ) , it appears that the onset of the slim disc , if it appears , happens if the flux approaches a value of @xmath34 crab and beyond .",
    "otherwise the geometry of the disc remains thin and the non - thermal emission is best explained to originate from the optically thin comptonizing cloud , and/or from the shock region at the boundary of the accretion disc and the compton cloud .",
    "in such a scenario the formation of the slim disc and the existence of the compton cloud might be competing events : but the last word in this can not be claimed from the given data reported here . the @xmath6@xmath14 behavioural patterns qualitatively suggest that for each flare the mass accretion perhaps does not change much but the slim disc phase sees a lot of fluctuation in terms of @xmath14 as well as @xmath6 .",
    "this change in the inner disc temperature and the inner disc radius may be due to instability on the disc or the disappearance of matter from the inner part of the disc .",
