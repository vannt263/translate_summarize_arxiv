    "the equivalence between uncertainty relations , in particular the uncertainty relation between position and momentum , @xmath8 and the duality relation has been the subject of debate . the claim that they are logically independent @xcite has been put into question by drr and rempe @xcite who related the duality relation to uncertainty relations between _ pauli matrices _ for two - level systems .",

    "a second challenge to interferometric complementarity suggests that superresolution  @xcite or perfect resolution  @xcite from metamaterial ` perfect lenses '  @xcite is not easily reconciled with complementarity and interferometry because the bohr - heisenberg interpretation of heisenberg s @xmath4-ray microscope  @xcite links the uncertainty relation to the optical diffraction limit .",

    "both are usually taken to be a number between 0 and 1 . if @xmath0 assumes the maximum value 1 , the atom passes with certainty through only one of the two paths .",
    "obviously , this would prohibit any interference phenomena between the two paths so @xmath1 should be zero in this case . on the other hand , if @xmath11 the probabilies for the atom to pass through either path are equal .",

    "an atom then has internal ( electronic ) and com degrees of freedom , and it is the latter which will be in the focus of our attention . if an atom is prepared in a ( com- ) state localized around @xmath13 , corresponding to one arm of the interferometer , it is described by a normalized wave function @xmath14 .",

    "we wish to employ a conclusive protocol for identifying which of two non - orthogonal states best describes the preparation of the system .",
    "if the state is found to be in one of the two states , then we can be certain this is the prepared state , but the price is that a third measurement must be allowed : the null measurement . if the result is a null measurement , then we are completely uncertain about which state was prepared . the optimal positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) for a conclusive protocol for two non - orthogonal states",
    "is given by the rank - three set of operators  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 corresponds to the null measurement .",

    "the latter corresponds to the normalized difference @xmath61 between the maximum and minimum of the fringe pattern @xmath32 .",
    "if the processes of measuring which way information , recombining the beam , and detecting the atoms do not alter the shape of the atomic wavepacket , one may describe the interferometer with just two states ( one for each beam ) @xcite .",
    "the fringe pattern @xmath32 can then be observed by measuring the overlap of the incoming atomic state @xmath62 with the output of the interferometer , which corresponds to a measurement of the observable @xmath63 . in our case",
    "the which way measurement may in general change the wavepacket , but a straightforward generalization of the previous observable is the overlap between the recombined state @xmath64 and the input state @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 this yields @xmath67 in the limit of non - overlapping wavepackets visibility reduces to @xmath68 for completely overlapping wavepackets we find @xmath69 , which is again a consequence of the indistinguishability of the paths .",
    "the duality relation ( [ eq : wvineq ] ) , which conveys that there is an informational trade - off between which path information and visibility  @xcite , can easily be verified in the case of non - overlapping wavepackets . using the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xmath70 one finds @xmath71 and @xmath72 so that @xmath73 .",

    "case  ( ii ) corresponds to the situation that the interferometer is perfectly balanced ( the atom travels through both paths with equal probability ) even after the position measurement .",
    "hence @xmath80 and , because the contrast of the fringes is not affected by a non - perfect overlap of the detector function , @xmath81 .",
    "it seems obvious that the duality relation should also be fulfilled for overlapping states because any overlap should decrease the distinguishability between the two interferometer arms and thus reduce @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "a typical example of one of the 20 inequalities would be @xmath87 .",

    "in this section we offer a new perspective on the ongoing debate whether the duality relation  ( [ eq : wvineq ] ) is logically independent of heisenberg s uncertainty relation  @xcite or not  @xcite . to address this conundrum we consider the special case of non - overlapping wavepackets . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our considerations to the spatial component @xmath9 that is parallel to the separation vector @xmath95 between the two interferometer paths .",
    "we assume that @xmath93 is a wavepacket of arbitrary shape that is centered around the origin , with a width that is small compared to the separation @xmath96 between the two beams . in this case",
    "the position uncertainty induced by the finite width of @xmath93 is generally negligible as compared to that induced by the superposition of the two interferometer paths @xmath93 and @xmath97 .",
    "we then can make the approximation @xmath98 so that @xmath99",
    ". the position uncertainty in state @xmath100 then simplifies to @xmath101 because which way information quantifies the probabilities for an atom to take one of the two interferometer paths one would generally expect a close relation between @xmath0 and @xmath102 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath103 one knows with certainty that the atom took one of the two paths so that @xmath102 should be comparable to the width of the wavepacket @xmath93 . on the other hand , if @xmath11 then it is uncertain which path the atom takes",
    ". then @xmath102 should be of the order of the path separation @xmath95 which may be much larger than the width of the wavepacket .",
    "however , the argument above does not take the quality of the position measurement into account . if we can make the same approximations in the evaluation of @xmath104 as in that of @xmath102 , then a taylor expansion of the detector function yields @xmath105 , which results in @xmath106    however , this exact relationship between @xmath102 and @xmath0 is only valid if @xmath107 , i.e. , if the detector function @xmath108 varies little over the the extent of the wavepacket @xmath93 .",

    "using the cauchy - schwartz inequality ( [ csineq ] ) in the form @xmath118 one easily finds @xmath119 which reflects the fact that @xmath120 is not affected by the phase of @xmath90 and hence is less sensitive to rapid variations of the detector function .",
    "the connection between momentum uncertainty and visibility is more subtle .",

    "( [ eq : t ] ) can also be associated with a `` phase observable '' @xmath121 .",
    "if we were able to measure this phase observable directly , then it would be possible to relate the duality relation directly to the uncertainty of position and momentum .",

    "we resolve this question by demonstrating that the detection of light emitted by a two - level atom ( 2la ) in an atom interferometer corresponds to a generalized position measurement .",
    "the quality of the lenses therefore can only affect the amount of which way information that can be obtained , but it can not affect the duality relation ( [ eq : wvineq ] ) .",

    "we have @xmath203 and therefore @xmath204 ; the difference in the numerical prefactor is due to the gaussian lens approximation that we have used .    in the case",
    "that the wave function @xmath14 is a gaussian with width @xmath205 and the two wavepackets @xmath206 are well separated one finds @xmath207 the exponential damping terms @xmath208 reflect the fact that if the atomic wave function distance @xmath24 is much larger than the width @xmath196 of the detector function , then the photo detection will allow to distinguish the two wavepackets .",

    "this is given by @xmath215 ( total photon momentum ) @xmath216 ( wave function separation)/(propagation length ) @xmath217 .    in fig .",

    "we have analyzed the relation between the duality relation @xmath222 , which connects which way information @xmath0 and fringe visibility @xmath1 in an atom interferometer and a heisenberg uncertainty relation between atomic position and ( modular ) momentum . a quantitative link between both concepts",
    "can be established by modeling the process of splitting the matter beam using the operator @xmath223 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) , which spatially shifts the initial wavepacket by a distance @xmath95 .",
    "this shift operator can also be interpreted as the operator of the atomic modular momentum .",
    "the process of splitting the atomic beam is therefore naturally connected to a change in modular momentum .",
    "we have shown that this connection allows us to derive the uncertainty relation from the duality relation if @xmath0 is obtained by a generalized ( smeared out ) position measurement .",
    "furthermore we have shown that the detection of spontaneously emitted photons in an atom interferometer corresponds to a generalized position measurement , provided the detection device can be described using lossless linear optical elements and projection measurements .",
    "because the duality relation holds regardless of the specific nature of the detection device , the complementarity principle of quantum mechanics holds regardless of the quality of the detection device in use .",
    "complementarity is therefore not affected by superresolving optical devices or perfect lenses based on meta - materials ; such optical elements can only affect the amount of which way information that can be gathered , but not the duality relation .    _",
