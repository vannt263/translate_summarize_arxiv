    "today , bianchi type  ix enjoys an almost mythical status in general relativity and cosmology , which is due to two commonly held beliefs : ( i ) type  ix dynamics is believed to be essentially understood ; ( ii ) bianchi type  ix is believed to be a role model that captures the generic features of generic spacelike singularities .",
    "however , we will illustrate in this paper that there are reasons to question these beliefs .",
    "the idea that type  ix is essentially understood is a misconception .",
    "in actuality , surprisingly little is known , i.e. , proved , about type  ix asymptotic dynamics ; at the same time there exist widely held , but rather vague , beliefs about mixmaster dynamics , oscillations , and chaos , which are frequently mistaken to be facts . there is thus a need for clarification : what are the known facts and what is merely believed about type  ix asymptotics",
    "? we will address this issue in two ways : on the one hand , we will discuss the main rigorous results on mixmaster dynamics , the ` bianchi type  ix attractor theorem ' , and its consequences ; in particular , we will point out the limitations of these results . on the other hand",
    ", we will provide the infrastructure that makes it possible to sharpen commonly held beliefs ; based on this framework we will formulate explicit refutable conjectures .    historically , bianchi type ix vacuum and orthogonal perfect fluid models entered the scene in the late sixties through the work of belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz @xcite and misner and chitr  @xcite .",
    "bkl attempted to understand the detailed nature of singularities and were led to the type ix models via a rather convoluted route , while misner was interested in mechanisms that could explain why the universe today is almost isotropic .",
    "bkl and misner independently , by means of quite different methods , reached the conclusion that the temporal behavior of the type ix models towards the initial singularity can be described by sequences of anisotropic kasner states , i.e. , bianchi type i vacuum solutions .",
    "these sequences are determined by a discrete map that leads to an oscillatory anisotropic behavior , which motivated misner to refer to the type ix models as mixmaster models  @xcite .",
    "this discrete map , the kasner map , was later shown to be associated with stochasticity and chaos  @xcite , a property that has generated considerable interest  and confusion ,",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein . a sobering thought : all claims about chaos in einstein s equations rest on the ( plausible ) belief that the kasner map actually describes the asymptotic dynamics of einstein s equations ; as will be discussed below , this is far from evident ( despite being plausible ) and has not been proved so far .",
    "more than a decade after bkl s and misner s investigations a new development took place : einstein s field equations in the spatially homogeneous ( sh ) case were reformulated in a manner that allowed one to apply powerful dynamical systems techniques  @xcite ; gradually a picture of a hierarchy of invariant subsets emerged where monotone functions restricted the asymptotic dynamics to boundaries of boundaries , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "based on work reviewed and developed in  @xcite and by rendall  @xcite , ringstrm eventually produced the first major proofs about asymptotic type  ix dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this achievement is remarkable , but it does not follow that all questions are settled . on the contrary , so far nothing is rigorously known , e.g. , about dynamical chaotic properties ( although there are good grounds for beliefs ) , nor has the role of type  ix models in the context of generic singularities been established  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ basic ] we briefly describe the hubble - normalized dynamical systems approach and establish the connection with the metric approach . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the vacuum case and the so - called orthogonal perfect fluid case , i.e. , the fluid flow is orthogonal w.r.t .  the sh symmetry surfaces",
    "; furthermore , we assume a linear equation of state . in section  [ subsets ]",
    "we discuss the levels of the bianchi type  ix so - called lie contraction hierarchy of subsets , where we focus on the bianchi type  i and type  ii subsets . in section  [ nongeneric ]",
    "we present the results of the local analysis of the fixed points of the dynamical system and discuss the stable and unstable subsets of these points which are associated with non - generic asymptotically self - similar behavior .",
    "section  [ maps ] is devoted to a study of the network of sequences of heteroclinic orbits ( heteroclinic chains ) that is induced by the dynamical system on the closure of the bianchi type  ii vacuum boundary of the type  ix state space ( which we refer to as the mixmaster attractor subset ) .",
    "these sequences of orbits are associated with the mixmaster map , which in turn induces the kasner map and thus the kasner sequences .",
    "we analyze the properties of non - generic kasner sequences and discuss the stochastic properties of generic sequences . in section  [ furthermix ]",
    "we discuss the main ` mixmaster facts ' : ringstrm s ` bianchi type  ix attractor theorem '  @xcite , theorem  [ rinthm ] , and a number of consequences that follow from theorem  [ rinthm ] and from the results on the mixmaster / kasner map .",
    "in addition , we introduce and discuss the concept of ` finite mixmaster shadowing ' . in the subsection",
    "` attractor beliefs ' of section  [ stochasticbeliefs ] we formulate two conjectures that reflect commonly held beliefs about type  ix asymptotic dynamics and list some open issues that are directly connected with these conjectures . in the subsection ` stochastic beliefs ' we address the open question of which role the mixmaster / kasner map and its stochastic properties actually play in type  ix asymptotic dynamics .",
    "this culminates in the formulation , and discussion , of two ` stochastic ' conjectures . in section  [ billiard ]",
    "we present the hamiltonian billiard formulation , see  @xcite or  @xcite ; we demonstrate that this approach yields a ` dual ' formulation of the asymptotic dynamics .",
    "we point out that the billiard approach is a formidable heuristic picture , but fails to turn beliefs into facts .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concl ] with a discussion of the main themes of this paper . throughout this paper",
    "we use units so that @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of light and @xmath3 the gravitational constant .",
    "we consider vacuum or orthogonal perfect fluid sh bianchi type  ix models ( i.e. , the fluid 4-velocity is assumed to be orthogonal to the sh symmetry surfaces ) with a linear equation of state ; we require the energy conditions ( weak / strong / dominant ) to hold , i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid , respectively . by",
    "we exclude the special cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where the energy conditions are only marginally satisfied . , see  @xcite . the case @xmath10 is known as the stiff fluid case , for which the speed of sound is equal to the speed of light .",
    "the asymptotic dynamics of stiff fluid solutions is simpler than the oscillatory behavior characterizing the models with range @xmath11 , and well understood  @xcite .",
    "( in the terminology introduced below , the stiff fluid models are asymptotically self - similar . )",
    "we will therefore refrain from discussing the stiff fluid case in this paper .",
    "] as is well known , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein , for these models there exists a symmetry - adapted frame @xmath12 ,    [ bixform ] @xmath13    hence , the type  ix models naturally belong to the so - called class  a bianchi models , see table  [ classamodels ] . let @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the second fundamental form associated with   of the sh hypersurfaces @xmath18 .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be interpreted as the expansion and the shear , respectively , of the normal congruence of the sh hypersurfaces . in a cosmological context",
    "it is customary to replace @xmath19 by the hubble variable @xmath21 ; this variable is related to changes of the spatial volume density according to @xmath22 .",
    "evidently , in bianchi type  ix ( and type viii ) there is a one - to - one correspondence between the ` orthonormal frame variables ' @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ; in particular , the metric @xmath26 is obtained from @xmath27 via  .",
    "( for the lower bianchi types  i@xmath28 , some of the variables @xmath27 are zero , cf .",
    "; in this case , the other frame variables , i.e. , @xmath29 , are needed as well to reconstruct the metric ; see  @xcite for a group theoretical approach . )",
    ".the class  a bianchi types are characterized by different signs of the structure constants @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is any permutation of @xmath32 .",
    "in addition to the above representations there exist equivalent representations associated with an overall change of sign of the structure constants ; e.g. , another type ix representation is @xmath33 .

    "in combination with   it follows that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are _ bounded towards the past_.    the right hand side of the reduced system  ( [ ixeq ] ) consists of polynomials of the state space variables and is thus a regular dynamical system .",

    "let us elaborate .",
    "let @xmath564 be fixed . by the implicit function theorem , the inequality @xmath565 is satisfied if and only if @xmath566 or @xmath567 for some functions @xmath568 , @xmath569 , which satisfy @xmath570 and @xmath571 as @xmath572 .",

    "the question is how often @xmath468 enters the hazard zone , i.e. , how often   occurs : finitely many times or infinitely many times ?",
    "suppose that the mixmaster stochasticity conjecture is correct .",
    "then almost every sequence @xmath468 admits a probabilistic interpretation in terms of the probability distribution  .",
    "accordingly , we expect the question to turn into an example of a ` 01 law ' : there exists two alternatives : ( i ) type  ix orbits ( i.e. , sequences @xmath468 ) that satisfy   infinitely many times are generic ( i.e. , of measure  @xmath194 in the state space ) ; type  ix orbits that do not are non - generic ( i.e. , of measure  @xmath578 ) ; ( ii ) type  ix orbits that satisfy   infinitely many times are non - generic ; orbits that do not are generic .",
    "( in both cases , the two sets , the ` generic set ' and the ` non - generic set ' , are probably non - empty . )",
    "which of these alternatives is actually realized depends on the rate of decay of @xmath579 and the decay and growth of @xmath568 and @xmath569 , respectively , as @xmath572 .",
    "case ( i ) is associated with small ( subcritical ) rates of decay ; case ( ii ) with large ( overcritical ) decay .",
    "we conjecture that case ( ii ) applies , i.e. ,   is satisfied only finitely many times for generic type  ix orbits .",
    "the reason for this conjecture is the fast rate of convergence of the orbit to the mixmaster attractor which follows from the decay of the functions @xmath580 , cf .  , and  @xmath581 , cf .  @xcite ; this leads to the expectation that the r.h .",
    "side of   represents a rapidly decaying function . to conclude our line of arguments in favor of the kasner map convergence conjecture , we note that the actual error @xmath470 can be estimated by @xmath528",
    "therefore , if @xmath582 for all @xmath256 except for a finite set , then also @xmath583 for all @xmath256 except for a finite set . since @xmath577 is an arbitrary positive number , the statement of the kasner map convergence conjecture ensues .",
    "we round off this section with some further remarks on the conjectures .",
    "first , we note that one might be led to suppose that there could in fact exist type  ix solutions for which the statement of the kasner map convergence conjecture is violated , i.e. , @xmath480 as @xmath462 . in any case",
    ", the class of these special solutions is at most of measure zero .",
    "second , we note that the statement of the kasner map convergence conjecture , i.e. , @xmath479 ( @xmath459 ) , and the statement @xmath519 ( @xmath507 ) , cf .  the discussion on piecewise exact sequences , are expressions of one and the same stochastic property .",
    "this emphasizes that the two ` stochastic ' conjectures tightly intertwine .",
    "third , we remark that it is conceivable that ` almost every ' in the two conjectures might be in fact ` every ' . in that case , the non - generic examples of kasner / mixmaster sequences , see section  [ maps ] , would not have any counterparts among the type  ix solutions .",
    "of particular interest in this context would be to have an answer to question ( ii ) of the second subsection of section  [ beliefs ] .",
    "if there do not exist type  ix orbits whose @xmath154-limit set is one of the heteroclinic cycles , this would be a strong indication in favor of ` every ' and against ` almost every ' .",
    "if there exist type  ix orbits that converge to a cycle , ` almost every ' is the best one can aim for in the mixmaster stochasticity conjecture .    finally , let us briefly comment on claims of stochastic and chaotic properties of bianchi type  ix asymptotic dynamics .",
    "chaotic aspects of the kasner map and related maps have been studied under various aspects  @xcite . however , the relevance of these maps for type  ix asymptotics rests on the two conjectures in this section .",
    "if the conjectures turn out to be wrong ( e.g. , if there exists a generic set of solutions that converge to heteroclinic cycles ) , then none of the results on the kasner map carry over to full type  ix dynamics .",
    "numerical investigations , see  @xcite and references therein , reflect theorem  [ rinthm ] and finite shadowing , but it is implausible that numerics can possibly shed light on the actual asymptotic limit of type  ix solutions .",
    "numerical errors are unavoidable and random in nature ; these errors generate precisely the type of stochasticity the simulation is looking for . accordingly",
    ", numerical studies will necessarily find type  ix solutions to exhibit the same stochastic behavior as generic kasner sequences and are thus not suited to explore the validity of the conjectures .",
    "in this section we briefly review the hamiltonian billiard approach to type  ix dynamics in the spirit of  @xcite and make contact with the dynamical systems approach .",
    "the metric   can be written as @xmath584 where @xmath585 is an arbitrary time variable that is related to proper time @xmath57 by a densitized lapse function @xmath586 according to @xmath587 ; evidently , @xmath588 $ ] .",

    "as argued in  @xcite , @xmath603 is expected to be timelike in the asymptotic regime , i.e. , @xmath604 . assuming that @xmath603 is timelike allows to introduce new metric variables instead of @xmath605 .",
    "defining @xmath606 and orthogonal angular metric variables , collectively denoted by @xmath153 , leads to @xmath607 where @xmath608 is the standard metric on hyperbolic space . making a further change of variables , @xmath609 yields @xmath610\\:.\\ ] ] choosing the lapse according to @xmath611 leads to a hamiltonian of the form @xmath612 + \\bar{\\rho}^2 \\sum_a c_a\\,\\exp(-2 \\bar{\\rho}\\ , w_a(\\gamma))\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath613 denotes certain linear forms of the variables @xmath614 , i.e. , @xmath615 ; see  @xcite for details .",

    "accordingly , only ` dominant ' terms in the potential are assumed to be of importance for the generic asymptotic dynamics , while ` subdominant ' terms , i.e. , terms whose exponential functions can be obtained by multiplying dominant wall terms , are neglected . in the present case",
    "there are three dominant terms in @xmath621 ( which is the minimal set of terms required to define the billiard table ) , the three exponentials @xmath622 .",

    "the correspondence between the dynamical systems picture and the hamiltonian picture is easily obtained by noting that the hamiltonian constraint   is proportional to the gauss constraint  .",

    "based on the heuristic considerations the limiting hamiltonian   is believed to describe generic asymptotic dynamics .",
    "[ cc][cc]@xmath627 [ cc][cc]@xmath628 [ cc][cc]@xmath629     the hamiltonian picture ( as represented by the billiard ) and the dynamical systems picture ( as represented by the mixmaster attractor ) are ` dual ' to each other . in the hamiltonian picture",
    "the asymptotic dynamics is described as the evolution of a point in the billiard .",
    "straight lines ( geodesics ) in hyperbolic space correspond to kasner states .",
    "wall bounces correspond to bianchi type  ii solutions ; the bounces change the kasner states according to the kasner map .",
    "since the billiard picture emphasizes the dynamics of the configuration space variables , one may say that the hamiltonian billiard approach yields a ` configuration space ' representations of the essential asymptotic dynamics .    in the dynamical systems state space picture",
    "the motion in the hamiltonian billiard picture becomes a ` wall ' of fixed points ",
    "the kasner circle @xmath101 .",
    "the walls in the hamiltonian billiard are translated to motion in the dynamical systems picture  bianchi type  ii heteroclinic orbits ; these type  ii transitions yield exactly the same rule for changing kasner states as the wall bounces : the kasner map .",
    "since the variables",
    "@xmath630 are proportional to @xmath631 , it is natural to refer to the projected dynamical systems picture as a ` momentum space ' representation of the asymptotic dynamics .    summing up , ` walls ' and ` straight line motion ' switch places between the hamiltonian formulation and dynamical systems description of asymptotic dynamics , and the two pictures",
    "give equivalent complementary asymptotic pictures .",
    "the above heuristic derivation of the limiting hamiltonian rests on two basic assumptions : it is assumed that @xmath603 is timelike in the asymptotic regime and that one can drop the subdominant terms .",
    "these assumptions correspond to assuming that @xmath44 and @xmath400 can be set to zero asymptotically , i.e. , the procedure precisely assumes theorem  [ rinthm ] .",
    "( the hamiltonian analysis in  ( * ? ?",
    "? * chapter 2 ) uses the same assumptions , and hence the present discussion is of direct relevance for that work as well . ) that these assumptions are highly non - trivial is indicated by the difficulties that the proof of theorem  [ rinthm ] has presented ; cf .",
    "an alarming example is bianchi type  viii ; in this case the heuristic procedure in this respect leads to exactly the same asymptotic results , but so far there exist no proof that @xmath44 and @xmath400 tend to zero towards the singularity for generic solutions .",
    "we elaborate on the differences between type  viii and type  ix in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , like in the state space picture there exists no proof that all of the possible billiard trajectories are of relevance for the asymptotic dynamics of type  ix solutions .",
    "for example , there exists a correspondence between periodic orbits in the dynamical systems picture and the hamiltonian billiard picture , and it is not excluded a priori that solutions are forced to one , or several , of these .",
    "we emphasize again that all proposed measures of chaos that take billiards as the starting point , see  @xcite and references therein , rely the conjectured connection between the mixmaster map and asymptotic type  ix dynamics .",
    "the above discussion shows that there are non - trivial assumptions and subtle phenomena that are being glossed over in heuristic billiard ` derivations . '",
    "nevertheless , we do believe that the billiard procedure elegantly uncovers the main generic asymptotic features , and it might be fruitful to attempt to combine the dynamical systems and hamiltonian picture in order to prove the mixmaster conjectures .",

    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we analyze the main known results on the asymptotic dynamics of bianchi type  ix vacuum and orthogonal perfect fluid models towards the initial singularity . the setting for",
    "our discussion is the hubble - normalized dynamical systems approach , since this is essentially the set - up which has led to the first rigorous statements on bianchi type  ix asymptotics  @xcite .",
    "( we choose slightly different variables to emphasize the permutation symmetry that underlies the problem . ) the main result ( ` mixmaster fact ' ) is theorem  [ rinthm ] which is due to ringstrm  @xcite ; for an alternative proof see  @xcite .",
    "this theorem , in conjunction with an analysis of the mixmaster attractor , leads to a number of further rigorous results which we list as consequences  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we draw a clear line between rigorous results ( ` facts ' ) and heuristic considerations ( ` beliefs ' ) .",
    "we make explicit that the implications of theorem  [ rinthm ] and its consequences are rather limited , in particular , the rigorous results do not give any information on the details of the oscillatory nature of mixmaster asymptotics .",
    "the mathematical methods required to obtain proofs about the actual asymptotic mixmaster oscillations are yet to be developed ; it is likely that radically new ideas are needed .",
    "this paper provides the infrastructure that might yield the basis for further developments .",
    "our framework enables us to transform vague beliefs to a number of specific conjectures that describe the expected ` complete picture ' of bianchi type  ix asymptotics .",
    "the arguments we give in their favor are based on an in - depth analysis of the mixmaster map and its stochastic aspects in combination with the dynamical systems concept of shadowing .",
    "we conclude with a few pertinent comments .",
    "first , as elaborated in  @xcite there exists no corresponding theorem to theorem  [ rinthm ] in other oscillatory bianchi models such as bianchi type vi@xmath636 or viii ; this suggests that the situation in the general inhomogeneous case is even more complicated than expected .",
    "furthermore , numerical studies are incapable of shedding light on the asymptotic limit .",
    "this is mainly due to the accumulation of inevitable random numerical errors that make it a priori impossible to track a particular type  ix orbit .",
    "finally , although the hamiltonian methods are a formidable heuristic tool , so far this approach has not yielded any proofs about asymptotics .",
    "nevertheless , it might prove to be beneficial to explore the possible synergies between dynamical systems and hamiltonian methods .    in this paper and in  @xcite we have encountered remarkable subtleties as regards the asymptotic dynamics of oscillatory singularities ; this emphasizes the importance of a clear distinction between facts and beliefs .",
