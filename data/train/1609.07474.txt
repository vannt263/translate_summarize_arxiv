    "over the past eons , tidal interaction produced a major evolution of the earth - moon system , producing a relatively slowly rotating planet down from about one - third of centrifugal break - up at birth , very similar then to jupiter s state today .",
    "for a detailed discussion on the break - up angular velocity @xmath11 of a planet of mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions are inherently dissipative , determined by a phase - lag between tidal deformation and position of the perturber , i.e. , a misalignment of tidal bulge relative to the earth - moon direction . for the earth , dissipation is primarily in the ocean tidal flows , more so than viscoelastic deformation of the earth s mantle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , a detailed quantitative account for the overall moon s migration time due to various nonlinear dissipation channels @xcite , remains to be identified .",
    "tidal dissipation @xcite has various mechanisms in shallow water wave theory , some of which have recently been highlighted in detailed numerical simulations on ocean dynamics and dissipation covering relatively short initial and present epochs ( e.g * ? ?",

    "dissipation generally occurs when nonlinear steepening exceeds the mitigating effect of dispersion . determining the net global result from detailed modeling of tidal dissipation is particularly challenging by the diversity of oceans and coastal regions , where most of the dissipation is expected to occur @xcite .    here , we focus on scaling in both amplitude and frequency of global tidal dissipation to account for the earth - moon history over the past 4.52 gyr .",
    "this approach aims at providing an effective description of an otherwise complex spatio - temperal distribution of dissipation in broadband ocean waves . for a confrontation with data , the moon s migration time is computed by numerical integration of angular momentum transfer backwards in time , to the instant of its formation from the earth or a surrounding proto - lunar disk",
    "this approach enables taking into account variations in tidal implitude over a few orders of magnitude , the effect of which seems not to have been computed before .",
    "the evolution by coupling to the earth s spin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is conveniently described by the orbital angular momentum @xmath14 with semi - major axis @xmath15 , where @xmath16 g and @xmath17 g denote the mass of the moon and , respectively , earth .",
    "the orbital ellipticity @xmath18 is presently about @xmath19 .",
    "a large dynamic range in tidal interaction strength arises from the tidal amplitude @xmath20 by which the moon s specific angular momentum at radius @xmath21 evolves according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the phase - lag of the moon s orbit relative to the tide raised on the earth , and @xmath24 is the mutual interaction strength for a given @xmath5 . as a result , @xmath25 ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "it serves to parameterize damping in our model based on ( [ eqn_j ] ) and the pendulum equation (  4 ) .",
    "this model is explored numerically in  5 . in  6 , we summarize the results .",
    "while the theory of linear shallow water waves is dissipationless , finite amplitude waves can steepen to dissipative bores , provided that steeping exceeds the mitigating effect of dispersion .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity over dispersion is expressed by ursell number @xmath26 , by the amplitude @xmath5 and wave length @xmath27 @xcite @xmath28 here specialized to shallow water waves with propagation speed @xmath29 in oceans of depth @xmath30 at tidal period @xmath31 , where @xmath32ms@xmath33 is the earth s gravitational acceleration . while , a large ursell number is suggestive of a general tendency for wave breaking , it does not directly define scaling of dissipation .    for breaking to occur",

    ", however , wave breaking is unlikely to occur in the open oceans even at present - day values of @xmath8 (  3 below ) .",

    "provides a time rate of dissipation effectively described by damping proportional to @xmath5 , possibly including tidal frequency in light of broadband wave spectra .",
    "our approach is focused on scaling in global dissipation described by ( [ eqn_epsd0 ] ) , to capture the net result of an otherwise complex spatio - temporal distribution of dissipation in the earth s oceans .",
    "we set out model global tidal dissipation in the earth s oceans by ( [ eqn_j ] ) in dimensionless variables , normalized by today s moon migration data and age .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this suggests that tidal dissipation is anomalously high at present .",

    "it defines a characteristic migration time scale @xmath49 that will serve to express the equation of motion ( [ eqn_j ] ) in terms of a dimensionless time @xmath50 (  3 below ) .",
    "being tidally locked , the moon spins slowly with negligible angular momentum . by now ,",
    "the earth s spin has effectively been transferred to the earth - moon orbit , since @xmath51 based on the moon s mass @xmath52 , the earth s angular momentum @xmath53 , radius @xmath54 and moment of inertia @xmath55 , $ ] @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the present - day tidal deformation @xmath57 ( in cm ) has a characteristic scale defined by the zero - frequency perturbation of the newtonian binding energy @xmath58 of self - gravity and @xmath59 in the moon s tidal field , @xmath60 , @xmath61 which recovers the familiar scaling @xmath62 with @xmath63 erg , consistent with existing estimates on ocean tide energies @xcite and measured mean values of the dynamical tidal amplitude @xmath5 to about 20% @xcite .",
    "consistency of @xmath57 with dynamical tidal amplitude is somewhat coincidental in view of the relatively minor deformation of the earth s mantle @xcite and an appreciable @xmath8-factor in the ocean tides ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ figa ] , with amplitude - frequency scaling ( [ eqn_epsd0 ] ) with @xmath64 shows that most of the moon s migration time is associated with the last 40% of its current distance .",
    "the first 60% is marked by a transition starting with a sharp spike , denoting rapid eviction of the moon from @xmath65 .",
    "it results from an anomalously large tidal wave amplitude of a few km ( essentially the current ocean depths ) , defined by @xmath66 in units of the present - day amplitue scale @xmath57 .",
    "thus , @xmath67 , giving an eviction time scale of about one hundred years out to tens of @xmath68 .",
    "while this is unlikely accurate , e.g. , tidal heating may have prevented water to condensate and may , instead , derive from a magma ocean @xcite , the idea seems valid that , once oceans form , eviction is swift .",
    "the migration time of the moon is determined by the rate of tidal dissipation , predominantly in tidal waves . in the past , forcing was mostly off - resonance in the inertial range above the resonance frequency @xmath38 in ( [ eqn_pe ] ) .",
    "linear theory of dissipation described by the stokes limit @xmath69 falls short of explaining a migration time equal to the moon s age .",
    "nonlinear dissipation mechanisms pointed to by ( [ eqn_ursell ] ) are important , now and even more so during off - resonance in the past .",
    "dissipation in bores is similar to that in shocks of compressible gas dynamics .",
    "the same is expected to feature spectral broadening and hardening by dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "damping representing total tidal dissipation hereby is expected to scale both with tidal amplitude and frequency proposed in ( [ eqn_epsd ] ) .",
    "total dissipation in the ocean tides contains also a component of internal dissipation by flows over non - smooth surfaces @xcite .",
    "it scales effectively with the cube of horizontal tidal flows @xcite , akin to high reynolds number flows past solid objects .",
    "according to the theory of shallow water wave equations , column height and height - averaged horizontal velocity satisfy the same wave equation in the linearized limit , the latter with amplitude @xmath70 for harmonic perturbations , internal dissipation is equivalently described by damping proportional to @xmath71 , and hence by @xmath5 as a consequence of ( [ eqn_uh ] ) . in table 2 , this is included in the scaling by tidal amplitude . in scaling damping of ocean waves by @xmath72 , the same would be included approximately to within 30% .    in considering ( [ eqn_r4e ] ) as an effective description of the dominant dissipation in semidiurnal tidal interactions , higher order tidal modes @xcite are neglected with generally complex dependence on ocean basin geometry @xcite . in a linearized approximation",
    ", one might contemplate including damping by higher harmonics .",
    "however , the latter are difficult to constrain observationally based on data of the moon s migration velocity .",
    "even if known , evolution of ocean basins on the geological time scale of @xmath73 myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes estimation of time - averages over a recent epoch highly uncertain . for this reason and the expectation that dissipation in the semi - diurnal tides",
    "are dominant , these higher order perturbations fall outside the scope of the present approach .    numerical integration of ( [ eqn_r4e ] ) with ( [ eqn_epsd ] ) reproduces a moon migration time equal to its age for a present @xmath8-factor ( [ eqn_qer ] ) in excellent agreement with the observational constraint ( [ eqn_qe ] ) . by ( [ eqn_epsd ] )",
    ", it introduces a dynamic @xmath8-factor @xmath74 that was substantially below @xmath75 in the past .",
    "its trajectory features a startingly fast eviction of the moon at or close to the initial , unstable synchronous orbit at @xmath76 . a protolunar disk with the same composition as the earth ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) might require even higher earth spin rates prior , to facilitate its ejection by a giant impact @xcite .",
    "if so , the moon is even more pertinent as a deposit of the earth s initial spin angular momentum .",
    "some uncertainty in the formulation of our model arises from the fact that the ocean eigenfrequency @xmath38 ( closest to the semidiurnal tidal frequency ) is that of the atlantic ocean . by continental drift",
    ", it evolves on aforementioned geological time scale that , in particular , might include intermittent closure @xcite . in our numerical formulation ,",
    "the present state then represents a time - average of a recent epoch , small relative to the moon s age of 4.5 gyr , probably satisfying @xmath77 where the right hand side refers to today s instantaneous value .",
    "here , we assume that during closure , @xmath38 is determined by the remaining oceans , also since @xmath8 of the atlantic near closure is probably suppressed by inversion ( uplift of the ocean basin ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ figke ] , ( [ eqn_ave ] ) corresponds to moving along the ordinate to the right . by the relative flatness of the curves shown ,",
    "our main conclusions hold , provided ( [ eqn_ave ] ) remains in the window @xmath78 for solutions to exist .",
    "implications of larger perturbations fall outside the scope of the present formulation .",
    "once oceans form , eviction of the moon was swift with steep spindown of the earth from what was very similar to that of jupiter today .",
    "in contrast to jupiter s extreme weather patterns @xcite , our dramatically reduced spin with small coriolis forces today facilitates a clement global climate . it is tempting to consider application of ( [ eqn_epsd ] ) further to exoplanet - moon systems @xcite , whose selection is currently based on temperature , mass and size @xcite .",
    "relatively distant moons may be indirect evidence for effective tidal interaction with oceans , further favoring a potentially clement climate conducive to advanced life .",
