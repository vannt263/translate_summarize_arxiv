    "the gap at the @xmath0 point ( this is not the actual gap if @xmath81 , because of the mexican hat structure ) , equals @xmath82 ; therefore , during the transition from the mexican hat to a parabolic band the gap closes at @xmath83 , after which it opens again .",

    "the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) points still split into four , but at very low energies the off center points have now a higher order crossing instead of the linear crossing present in monolayer graphene ( fig .  [ vis0serieszi](a ) ) . the most striking feature , however , is the formation of a dirac cone out of an energy band that once was parabolic ( fig .",
    "[ dsplittingbilayer](b ) ) .",
    "this dirac cone is located exactly at the former @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) point .",
    "the intralayer rashba interaction not only lifts the spin degeneracy of the energy bands , but also changes their individual behavior .",
    "if both the intralayer iso and rashba terms are nonzero , the dirac cone is destroyed and the particle - hole symmetry is broken .",
    "the presence of a dirac cone in unbiased bilayer graphene is a very special feature . together with the split @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) point , the spectrum that we found will give rise to two different low energy excitations , one of which is massless .",
    "the speed with which this massless excitation travels depends on the rashba constant ( see fig .",
    "[ vis0serieszi](b ) ) , which can be tuned by the perpendicular electric field .",
    "we expect that the dispersion relation shown in fig .",
    "[ vis0serieszi](a ) could be observed with arpes experiments , which have already successfully demonstrated the dirac dispersion in monolayer graphene.@xcite    in a biased system with nonzero iso interactions , the spin degeneracy of the energy bands is lifted .",
    "the splitting occurs only around the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) points .",
    "we also observe a band crossing at the @xmath56 point ( fig .",
    "[ vis025series](c ) and ( d ) ) . a bias voltage , in combination with the intralayer rashba coupling , destroys the dirac cones and the spectrum becomes asymmetric around the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) points .",
    "next , we considered an interlayer rashba interaction between the planes .",
    "this interlayer interaction would in principle be expected to be small compared to the intralayer one because of the larger interlayer atomic separation .",
    "however , this effect could still be important if pressure is applied to approach the two layers . in our model",
    ", the interlayer rashba coupling finds its origin in the presence of a tilted electric field . in a bilayer system with no intralayer",
    "so interactions , this interaction causes effectively a shift of the interlayer hopping parameter .",
    "however , in a system where the intralayer so couplings are nonzero , we see a clear effect in the energy spectrum . in an unbiased system with nonzero @xmath55",
    ", the spin degeneracy of the bands is lifted around the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) points and a mexican hat feature appears .",
    "the mexican hat feature is known to arise in the bilayer system in the presence of a bias voltage.@xcite here , however , we found that it can also appear without a bias , but solely due to so interactions .",
    "moreover , the mexican hat in the energy dispersion is fully spin polarized .",
    "if @xmath55 becomes large enough , the degeneracy of the two lowest laying conduction bands at the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) points is shifted to the two middle bands .",
    "the system then becomes isospin degenerate .",
    "indeed , in the presence of tunneling , a bilayer can be described as a two - level system , where the energy bands in each layer have combined into symmetric and antisymmetric energy bands , separated by a gap given by the tunneling energy .",
    "if we represent the asymmetric band by an isospin up and the symmetric one by an isospin down , we see that the iso interaction can lead to an isospin degeneracy at the @xmath0 and @xmath8 points , although the spins remain fully polarized .",
    "if the iso interaction is absent , but the intralayer rashba is nonzero , we have seen in fig .",
    "[ trinterrash ] that the effect of the interlayer rashba interaction is to destroy the dirac cone at the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) point and to modify the way the @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) point splits into four .",
    "we can no longer observe a linear crossing for the central point and the energy scales associated with this splitting are substantially smaller .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the possibility of observing experimentally the effects that we have described above .",
    "in monolayer graphene , the current estimates are that the iso interaction is very small ( @xmath2 mev).@xcite however , it is already possible to tune the rashba coupling in a graphene layer on a ni substrate up to @xmath110 ev.@xcite because these values should be representative for bilayer graphene as well , we expect that the results we found involving the rashba interaction are well within the experimental reach .",
    "we think it should be possible to detect the dirac cone that arises from the intralayer rashba term in an unbiased bilayer .",
    "if this dirac cone can be detected and if it is destroyed by an in - plane electric field , we would have an indication that indeed an interlayer rashba interaction is present in the system .",
    "the values we used for @xmath55 are larger than indicated experimentally .",
    "however , we should recall that the same kind of system can be engineered using cold atoms in optical lattices , and in this case there is much less constraint on the parameters of the model .",
    "our aim here was mainly to draw a comparison of the different effects of the rashba and iso interactions to determine the trend introduced by each one .",
    "a next step would be to include edge states in the model .",
    "if we regard the intralayer iso interaction and the bias voltage in bilayer graphene as being comparable with the iso interaction and a staggered sublattice potential in monolayer graphene , there is a possibility that the bilayer system would exhibit a phase transition , equivalent to the one described in ref  .",
    "it is already known that there are two types of edge states in bilayer graphene,@xcite but so interactions have not yet been taken into account .",
    "we hope that our results will motivate further theoretical studies and experiments in the field .",
