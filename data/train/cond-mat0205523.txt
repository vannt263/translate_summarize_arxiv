    "duality arguments suggest that the superconductor - insulator phase transition should be in the same universality class as the three - dimensional xy model , but with an inverted temperature axis.@xcite this means that the superconducting phase maps onto the symmetric phase , and the normal phase onto the broken phase .",
    "furthermore , the dual counterpart of the order parameter of the xy model is a non - perturbative field that creates the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortices in the superconductor .",
    "the most direct prediction of the duality is that the critical magnetic field @xmath0 , or equivalently the vortex tension @xmath1 , should scale with the xy model critical exponent @xmath2.@xcite in practice , it is easier to measure the scaling exponent @xmath3 of the penetration depth @xmath4 , but for that quantity , the theoretical picture is less clear . both @xmath5",
    "@xcite and @xmath6  @xcite were suggested before the prediction eventually converged to @xmath7.@xcite    ironically , two different experiments with yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 high - temperature superconductor have produced results that are each compatible with one of the earlier suggestions , namely @xmath11,@xcite and @xmath12.@xcite    similarly , it has turned out to be difficult to confirm the duality in monte carlo simulations of the ginzburg - landau theory away from the london limit,@xcite as they also seem to favour @xmath13 . in the london limit , where the duality is on a firmer footing,@xcite simulations  @xcite give @xmath14 through indirect measurements , though .",
    "there are two principal reasons for all this confusion :    1 .",
    "the duality relation is expected to apply quantitatively only in a narrow temperature interval near the critical point , where the vortex tension/@xmath15 is well below the inverse correlation lengths of the scalar and photon fields .",
    "2 .   the duality relates the fundamental fields and thermodynamical densities of one theory to non - perturbative and non - local objects in the other .",
    "these are difficult to measure both in experiments and in numerical simulations .    in the london limit ,",
    "the difficulty ( 1 ) is alleviated , as the scalar correlation length is very short , but in this paper we go even further and take another limit to obtain the abelian integer - valued lattice gauge theory , `` frozen superconductor '' ( fzs).@xcite for this theory , the duality transformation can be carried out exactly , and yields precisely the three - dimensional xy model with the villain action.@xcite the duality is therefore exactly valid at all temperatures .    the fzs  does not have a scalar ( higgs ) field to drive the transition , but it still has a transition between a low - temperature superconducting phase with massive gauge field excitations , and a high - temperature massless phase .",
    "( microscopically , this transition is due to the `` freezing '' of the discrete gauge variables below the critical temperature ; hence the name frozen superconductor . )",
    "this is mapped to the symmetry breaking transition of the xy - villain model , with inverted temperature ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "since the duality is valid at all temperatures , the problem ( 1 ) above is completely avoided .    in this paper",
    "we study the duality relation in detail with lattice monte carlo simulations .",
    "our aim is _ not _ to numerically verify the duality  it is , after all , a mathematical identity .",
    "rather , the purpose is to identify `` good '' observables and possible pitfalls in monte carlo studies of the duality relations of this type , especially bearing in mind the problems encountered in the gl theory simulations . by this we mean , first of all , that we want to construct pairs of observables in the frozen superconductor and in the xy model which are exactly dual to each other and which are sensitive to the critical behaviour .",
    "the observable in the frozen superconductor must be defined also in the full gl model .",
    "it is , however , equally important that the observables can be measured to a high accuracy in both theories .",
    "the exact duality of the models we consider allows us to check this and identify the errors caused by finite - size effects and possible inefficiencies caused by the numerical methods used . in this way",
    ", we hope to find out how to avoid the difficulty ( 2 ) in more realistic cases .",
    "the main body of the paper is concerned with the calculation of gauge invariant ( non - local ) order parameters of the fzs ; the vortex tension @xmath1 , the photon mass @xmath17 and the magnetic permeability @xmath18 .",
    "we relate these observables to their duals in the xy model , and study the critical behaviour .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 contains the definition of the two models and discusses the duality between them .",
    "section  3 introduces the observables and section 4  discusses their qualitative behaviour in the two phases . in section  5",
    ", the location of critical point is determined using the spin correlator in the xy model , and section  6 deals with the definition and the measurement of its dual counterpart , the vortex tension . in section  8",
    "we study the susceptibilities , i.e. , the photon correlator in the momentum space , and discuss the mass determination from them , and in section  7 , we extract the photon mass directly from the exponential decay of the correlation function in the coordinate space .",
    "finally , section  9 lists the main findings and concludes the paper .",
    "we start by formulating the three - dimensional ginzburg - landau theory in the london limit on a three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
