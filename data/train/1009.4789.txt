    "the special case @xmath5 is well studied and the sub - riemannian structure is related to the classical hopf fibration , see , e.g. , @xcite . at the same time , the sub - riemannian structure of @xmath6 comes naturally from the non - commutative group structure of @xmath7 in the sense that two vector fields span the smoothly varying distribution of the tangent bundle , and their commutator generates the missing direction .",

    "its spectrum is the set of possible outcomes of energy measurements which we suppose to be discrete and non - degenerate .",
    "the normalization condition is preserved by time evolution of the quantum system .",

    "observe that the state @xmath54 is viewed as an element of @xmath4 while the operator @xmath16 is thought of as an element of @xmath33 .",
    "thus the solutions to the schrdinger equation describe trajectories on @xmath4 , and the solution to the bloch equation describe trajectories on @xmath33 .",
    "the solution to the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath55 , @xmath56 , is of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . observe that if @xmath50 is an hermitian operator and if we denote by @xmath59 , then @xmath60 is an hermitian operator and @xmath61 .",
    "the operator @xmath62 is called the _ free hamiltonian_. if the system is considered under some external fields ( e.g. , an electromagnetic field ) whose amplitudes are represented by some functions @xmath63 , then @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are self - adjoint operators representing the coupling between the system and the external fields .",

    "the system is controllable if and only if the lie hull @xmath72    suppose that the operator @xmath73 , being viewed as an element of the projective space , evolves as a loop in time @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 .",
    "a crucial concept in many quantum mechanical effects is so - called the _ berry phase _ ( or berry - pancharatnam following @xcite ) .",
    "the state @xmath51 of the system evolves according to the schrdinger equation .",

    "the geometric berry phase refers to the curvature of the bundle .",
    "it emphasizes that the single - time probabilistic description does not exhaust the physical content of quantum mechanics and appears because of the bundle structure of the space of states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as berry @xcite mentions",
    ", barry simon commented in 1983 that the geometric phase factor has an interpretation in terms of holonomy because the phase curvature two - form emerges naturally as the first chern class of a hermitian line bundle .",
    "let us suppose that the hamiltonian @xmath50 is perturbed @xmath82 by a varying parameter @xmath83 , @xmath84 slowly enough so that the adiabatic approximation is applied with @xmath70 large .",
    "the systems undergoes transport along the closed path in the parametric space @xmath85 .",
    "the _ adiabatic theorem _ states that if the system starts at an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath86 , then it will end in the corresponding eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath87 at the final point under small perturbation remaining in its instantaneous eigenstate in all intermediate points @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "this theorem has been known from early years of quantum mechanics due to max born and vladimir fock .    once the controllability problem",
    "is solved one can look for a more efficient way to construct loops in the projective space of pure states . a typical way is to minimize the energy of transfer .",
    "the corresponding optimal control problem is equivalent to finding sub - riemannian geodesics on @xmath4 .",
    "the precise meaning of this will be explained in the following section .",
    "we consider the @xmath32-dimensional sphere @xmath4 as a real manifold embedded into the complex space @xmath0 .",
    "the riemannian metric @xmath88 on the sphere is the restriction of the euclidean metric from @xmath89 , that is , the real part of the hermitian product @xmath90 in @xmath0 .",
    "the complex hopf fibration @xmath91 is a principal circle bundle @xmath92 over the complex projective space @xmath93 .",
    "this roughly means that the preimage @xmath94 of any point @xmath95 is isomorphic to the unit circle @xmath8 endowed with the lie group structure of @xmath10 .",
    "the set @xmath96 is called the _ fiber _ , and @xmath93 is the _ base space _ , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the intersection of a complex line with the unit sphere @xmath4 gives a unit circle @xmath8 that is equipped with the group structure of @xmath10 .",
    "the action of @xmath97 on @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 we will use both real @xmath100 and complex coordinates @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "the horizontal tangent space @xmath103 at @xmath104 is the maximal complex subspace of the real tangent space @xmath105 .",
    "the unit normal real vector field @xmath106 at @xmath104 is given by @xmath107 the real vector field @xmath108 is globally defined and non - vanishing and we call it the _ vertical vector field_. the vector space @xmath109 is a two dimensional subspace of @xmath0 that inherits the standard almost complex structure from  @xmath0 , in other words we have an isomorphism @xmath110 of vector spaces .",
    "the orthogonal complement to @xmath111 with respect to the hermitian product is exactly the horizontal tangent space @xmath112 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath113 , @xmath114 , the fiber at a point @xmath104 , then it is easy to see that @xmath115 .",
    "thus , @xmath116 is the tangent space of the fiber @xmath117 at @xmath118 , that we denote by @xmath119 .",
    "the vertical tangent bundle of @xmath117 we denote by @xmath120 , and the horizontal tangent bundle is denoted by @xmath121",

    "the group @xmath3 acting in @xmath0 leaves @xmath4 invariant and preserves the orthogonal decomposition  .    concluding the above construction we will work with a sub - riemannian manifold that is the triple @xmath125 consisting of the smooth manifold @xmath4 , the horizontal sub - bundle ( or distribution @xmath126 ) , and the sub - riemannian metric @xmath123 .",
    "the same horizontal bundle can be obtained by considering the standard c - r geometry of odd - dimensional spheres or thinking of @xmath4 as a contact manifold endowed with the one - form  @xcite @xmath127    we are looking for sub - riemannian geodesics , or energy minimizing curves @xmath128 on @xmath4 .",

    "we may define a linear mapping @xmath133 .",

    "we denote by @xmath139 the one - dimensional kernel of @xmath140 at @xmath104 .",

    "moreover , the metric tensor @xmath88 defines the identification of tangent and cotangent bundles .",
    "thus , the riemannian geodesic @xmath192 is the result of the following superpositions @xmath193 here the first map @xmath194 is the inclusion of the tangent space at @xmath195 into the tangent bundle @xmath155 . the second map is the identification of the tangent and cotangent bundles by means of the metric @xmath88 , which also gives the initial data @xmath196 for the flow @xmath197 .",
