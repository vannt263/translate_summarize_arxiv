    "after the discovery of the higgs particle by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at lhc @xcite , it became critically important to check how close its features are to those in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "recently , it has been emphasized by carmi _",
    "@xcite , by chiang and yagyu @xcite , by santos @xcite and by ferreira _",
    "_ @xcite that current data are consistent with a lightest higgs from a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with a softly - broken @xmath9 symmetry and cp conservation , where the coupling of the bottom quark to the higgs ( @xmath10 ) has a sign _ opposite _ to that in the sm .    besides the sm gauge and fermion sector",
    ", the model has two cp - even scalars , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one cp - odd scalar @xmath13 , and a conjugate pair of charged scalars @xmath14 .",
    "the scalar potential can be written in terms of the usual vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath15 gev , and seven parameters : the four masses , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ; two mixing angles , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the ( real ) quadratic term breaking @xmath9 , @xmath22 . with a suitable basis choice , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "details about this model can be found , for instances , in refs .",
    "we follow here the notation of the latter .",
    "we concentrate on the type ii 2hdm , where the fermion couplings with the lightest higgs are ( multiplied by the mass of the appropriate fermion and divided by @xmath25 ) k_u = , [ ku ] for the up - type quarks , and k_d = - , [ kd ] for both the down - type quarks and the charged leptons . in the sm limit , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 negative ( positive ) corresponds to the ( opposite of the ) sm sign .",
    "the couplings of @xmath11 to vector boson pairs are g_hvv = k_v g_hvv^ =   g_hvv^ , [ ghvv ] where @xmath28 , and the coupling to a pair of charged higgs bosons may be written as @xcite g_h h^+ h^- = - ( g_1 + g_2 + g_3 ) , [ ghh+h- ] where g_1 & = & ( 1 - ) , + g_2 & = & , + g_3 & = & - .",
    "we have checked , with the help of ` feynrules `  @xcite , that this expression is correct .",
    "before @xmath14 are detected directly , their effect might be detected indirectly through loop contributions involving @xmath29 , especially in decays of @xmath11 which are already loop decays in the sm , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is possible if @xmath30 , because there will be a light particle in the loop .",
    "this is also possible for @xmath31 , when the @xmath14 loop contribution approaches a constant @xcite .",
    "however , making @xmath19 too large will require quartic couplings in violation of the unitarity bounds .",
    "this still leaves a rather wide range of @xmath14 masses where the charged higgs contributions to @xmath32 and @xmath4 could be detected . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that such non - decoupling is unavoidable in @xmath32 , if the wrong - sign @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) case is to conform to all current data .",
    "we have checked that such non - decoupling will also have an impact on @xmath4 .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fit ] , we discuss our fit procedure .",
    "there are differences with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , most notably in the production rates , as shown in section  [ subsec : differ ] . in section  [ subsec : vv ]",
    ", we point out the crucial importance of the @xmath35 channel by itself , which can be understood with quite simple arguments .",
    "it turns out that , once @xmath35 is constrained , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are rather sensitive to the production rates , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are not .",
    "this feature is explained in detail in section  [ subsec : production ] .",
    "section  [ sec:14 ] includes our predictions for the next lhc run , which will occur at 14 tev ( not 8 tev ) .",
    "we show that , before applying the constraints on @xmath35 , @xmath39 can be above the sm value by a factor of two . if such values were to be measured , we would exclude the sm .",
    "however , @xmath39 can also take the sm value , and it can not be used to exclude @xmath34 . in section  [ sec : flipped ] , we analyze the flipped 2hdm , where the coupling to the charged leptons goes like @xmath40 in eq .    not like @xmath41 in eq .  .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the scalar particle found at the lhc has been seen in the @xmath38 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 final states , with errors of order @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath36 final state is only seen ( at lhc and the tevatron ) in the associated @xmath46 production mechanism , with errors of order @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "searches have also been performed for the @xmath39 final state @xcite , with upper bounds around ten times the sm expectation at the @xmath48 confidence level .",
    "current lhc results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results for the @xmath49 rates ( where @xmath50 is some final state ) are usually presented in the form of ratios of observed rates to sm expectations .",
    "this is what we use to constrain the ratios between the 2hdm and sm rates _",
    "f = r_p r_d r_tw , [ mus ] where the sub - indices @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 stand for `` production '' , `` decay '' , and `` total width '' , respectively . here , r_p & = & , [ rp ] + r_d & = & , [ rd ] + r_tw & = & , [ rtw ] where @xmath54 is the higgs production mechanism , @xmath55 $ ] the decay width into the final state @xmath50 , and @xmath56 $ ] is the total higgs decay width .",
    "we follow the strategy of ref .",
    "@xcite , and assume that all observed decays have been measured at the sm rates , with the same error @xmath45 .",
    "for the most part , we keep @xmath36 out of the mix , because : it has larger errors ; it is only measured in the @xmath46 production channel ; and , as we will show , it is not needed in type ii models , were @xmath44 has the same effect ( which , moreover , is not very large ) .",
    "we will only assume that all production mechanisms are involved in @xmath36 and that its errors are of order @xmath45 when we wish to compare with ref .",
    "@xcite , explaining the differences in production .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations of the type ii 2hdm , with the usual strategy .",
    "we set @xmath57 gev , generate random points for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "these coincide with the ranges in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath64 and @xmath19 were chosen to conform with @xmath65 physics and @xmath66 data .    for each point",
    ", we derive the parameters of the scalar potential , and we keep only those points which provide a bounded from below solution @xcite , respecting perturbative unitarity @xcite , and the constraints from the oblique radiative parameters @xmath67 @xcite . at the end of this procedure , we have a set of possible 2hdm parameters , henceforth denoted simply by set .",
    "next , we generate the rates for all channels , including all production mechanisms : @xmath68 ( gluon fusion ) at nnlo from higlu @xcite , @xmath69 at nnlo from sushi @xcite , @xmath46 associated production , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( vector boson fusion ) @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the production cross section is dominated by the gluon fusion process with internal top quark . generically speaking",
    ", this also holds in the type ii 2hdm , but , given eq .  , the contribution from the gluon fusion process with internal bottom quark becomes more important as @xmath64 increases .",
    "we start by requiring that all points in the set obey @xmath6 and @xmath72 for the @xmath35 , @xmath73 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 at 8 gev .",
    "the surviving points are plotted as a function of @xmath64 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:5l ] , where we show the possible values of @xmath74 ( in black ) and @xmath75 ( in red / dark - gray ) .",
    "we notice that , although @xmath75 is in general larger than @xmath74 , the two regions overlap and , at the level of deviations of 20% from the sm , both are compatible with the sm value of one .",
    "we now assume that @xmath76 is measured within 5% of the sm : @xmath77 .",
    "the result is plotted in the right panel of fig  [ fig:5l ] .",
    "we found that @xmath74 agrees , within errors , with that shown in fig .",
    "5-left of ref .",
    "@xcite , while our result for @xmath75 is well above theirs , which we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig:5l ] ( in cyan / light - gray ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the colour codes , explained in the figure caption , mirror those in fig .",
    "[ fig : kd2sin2bma ] . here",
    "the @xmath45 measurement of @xmath78 does have a big impact .",
    "however , one might suspect that this may not change much the conclusions on @xmath79 and @xmath39 , because , as mentioned before , those were primarily determined by the constraint on @xmath80 .",
    "this is what we find in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flipped ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath78 is to reduce the allowed region by a very fine slice , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flipped ] as a green / light - gray line going diagonally from the origin with almost unit slope .",
    "this figure should be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse_kdneg ] , which holds in the type ii 2hdm . in both cases , a @xmath81 measurement of @xmath74 ( @xmath82 ) will ( will not ) exclude @xmath6 .",
    "we have analysed the type ii 2hdm with softly broken @xmath9 , scrutinizing the possibility that the @xmath83 coupling has a sign opposite to that in the sm and the impact on this issue of @xmath84 .",
    "we impose the usual theoretical constraints , assuming that @xmath80 , @xmath78 , and @xmath74 differ from the sm by no more than @xmath45 at 8 tev .",
    "we found that the constraint from @xmath80 is crucial , and can be understood in simple trigonometric terms .",
    "in particular , we show that this cut has a rather counter - intuitive implication .",
    "before this cut is applied , it would seem that the importance of the bottom - mediated gluon fusion production mechanism would grow linearly with @xmath64 .",
    "however , after current bounds are placed on @xmath80 , the importance of the bottom - mediated gluon fusion production mechanism grows asymptotically into a constant , for large @xmath64 .",
    "this generalizes as a cautionary tale : applying a new experimental bound may force unexpected relations among the parameters , and the theoretical intuition must be revised in this new framework .    in projecting to the future",
    ", we have then simulated our points at 14 tev , highlighting the fact , for the issues that interest us , using the current version of higlu at 14 tev or at 8 tev leads to the same results .",
    "we have shown that results for the @xmath36 and @xmath44 depend sensitively on the ratio @xmath85 encoding the relative weight of the square of the top - mediated gluon fusion production amplitude , and the interference of this amplitude with the bottom - mediated gluon fusion production amplitude . as a result",
    ", these channels should not be used to probe the @xmath6 possibility .",
    "even if that were not the case , since @xmath36 is only measured in associated production and , as we show , @xmath86 includes unity , this channel would not be useful .",
    "in contrast , in our simulations both @xmath79 and @xmath84 are roughly independent of @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , they exhibit delayed decoupling in the @xmath2 vertex . as a result , they could , in principle , be used to probe the @xmath6 possibility . indeed , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , a 5% measurement of @xmath74 around unity will be able to exclude @xmath6 .",
    "we then performed a detailed analysis of @xmath84 .",
    "we show that , before including the lhc data , values of @xmath74 and @xmath82 were allowed between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , but with a correlation between the two , as shown in the black regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse_kdneg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse_kdpos ] .",
    "this correlation is more important ( that is , the region in the figure is smaller ) for @xmath89 than it is for @xmath6 . in particular , @xmath90 with @xmath91 would be possible in the latter case , but not in the former .",
    "things change dramatically when the simple constraint @xmath92 is imposed . in that case",
    ", we obtain the red / dark - gray regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse_kdneg ] ( @xmath6 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse_kdpos ] ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this already places @xmath74 and @xmath82 close to the sm , although , strictly speaking , points with @xmath93 with @xmath94 are not allowed in our simulation when @xmath6 .",
    "a @xmath81 measurement of @xmath35 around the sm at 14 tev will bring @xmath82 closer to unity , for @xmath89 , and just below unity , for @xmath6 .",
    "thus , this decay can not be used to exclude @xmath6 .",
    "but we have the reverse advantage .",
    "it is obvious that a measurement of @xmath95 would exclude the sm .",
    "we have shown that a 5% precision on @xmath80 around the sm , together with @xmath95 , would also exclude @xmath6 , and , together with @xmath96 , would exclude altogether the type ii 2hdm with softly broken @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath82 turns out to lie a mere @xmath45 above the sm value , then the softly broken type ii 2hdm is not the solution .    finally , we analyzed the flipped 2hdm .",
    "although there is a substantial difference in the @xmath97 versus @xmath98 plane , this does not change dramatically the @xmath74@xmath82 correlation . as a result , here @xmath81 measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath79 around the sm at 14 tev will be enough to exclude @xmath6 , while @xmath82 will not .",
