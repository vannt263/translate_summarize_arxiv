    "learning or estimating models and relationships from data is ubiquitous and of importance to nearly every scientific discipline . in the unsupervised learning setup  @xcite ,",
    "the objective is to find hidden structure in unlabeled data . in other words",
    ", there is no explicit mapping from one set of variables to another which we are trying to learn .",
    "instead the objective is to find some low dimensional manifold which captures nearly all variability in the data .",
    "however , the models learnt this way are often not interpretable  @xcite .",
    "interpretability sheds light on the mechanics of data generating process , which can be used in subsequent exercises like design or decision making .    a major characteristic of interpretable models are their structures .",
    "by looking at the structure , it might be possible to interpret or attribute physical meaning to different groups of coefficients or terms .",
    "hence it is required to either learn structured models directly , or transform a learnt ( black - box ) model into the desired structure . in most cases",
    ", we do not possess the exact parametrized structural form of the model ( if that were the case , the task would reduce to simple parameter estimation ) .",
    "rather , what we possess are broad defining characteristics of the structures , like non - negativity in nmf  @xcite and sparsity in compressed sensing  @xcite or spca  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we look at a particular problem in the broad class of learning interpretable models . our objective is to identify ( or learn ) a network topology that connects the different variables in the given data .",
    "the work is motivated by mathematical curiosity and applications which require identifying underlying network topology like smart grids  @xcite , metabolic networks  @xcite , and water networks  @xcite .",
    "the method developed is inspired by principal component analysis ( pca )  @xcite , its various spin - offs  @xcite , and their graph theoretic interpretations .    as input ,",
    "we are given only a data matrix @xmath0 ( size @xmath6 ) , the rows of which describe different variables @xmath7 and , columns correspond to noisy measurements under different scenarios or configurations .",
    "in other words , the entry @xmath1 corresponds to variable @xmath8 is the @xmath9 configuration .",
    "there are @xmath10 variables and we possess full set of measurements ( i.e.  each variable measured ) corresponding to @xmath11 configurations . we seek to find a relationship between the variables , that are common across the different configurations . in this paper , we restrict our attention to approximate linear relationships ( alrs ) . in other words ,",
    "we seek a `` model '' @xmath4 ( size @xmath12 ) that captures the alrs of the form @xmath13 and is also consistent with a network incidence structure ( emphasized by the subscript ) .",
    "we also require that @xmath4 have full rank ( highest possible ) to ensure that we get the network with maximum number of nodes .",
    "also note that we are not given the number of equations ( or equivalently the rank of @xmath0 or number of nodes ) and hence we try and capture all possible predictability in the data . the structural properties and requirements of a network incidence structure",
    "are reviewed in section  4 .",
    "alternatively , we wish to solve the following optimization problem : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the set of all allowable incidence matrices or configurations with @xmath16 nodes and @xmath10 edges ( including dangling edges , see section 4 ) . here , @xmath16 must be specified for the optimization problem , and we wish to pick the maximum possible @xmath16 for which a solution exists .",
    "we interpret the learnt model as follows : there is a flow network whose edge flows are the variables @xmath17 and flow conservation is obeyed at the nodes .",
    "some examples are flow networks ( say water ) where we posses edge flow measurements by some means , and wish to infer either partial or total connectivity of the network . similarly in case of power grids , we may possess data on amount of power transmitted through edges but may not know how the edges are connected ( i.e. the node - edge incidence structure ) . in other words ,",
    "the problem is relevant to any case which involves edge flows , using which we try to identify or reconstruct the network topology .",
    "the network can describe an actual physical network as in the earlier examples , or may simply describe abstract relationships between variables in a convenient or concise manner .",
    "needless to say , identifying network topology can provide many insights about the system .",
    "for example , degree distribution reveals the presence of any central or hubs in the network ; clustering coefficient can provide insight about redundancy and hence robustness to failures ; and betweenness centrality can provide an insight about bottlenecks and flow traffic in the network , thereby giving us a good understanding of which variables are difficult to control .",
    "thus identifying the network structure will enable us to understand and manipulate it better .    in this paper , we provide a polynomial time algorithm for network topology identification .",
    "we also answer closely related and important questions like ( a )  under what conditions is network identifiable ? ( b ) how many different configurations ( i.e. data ) are required ? ( c )",
    "is the realized network unique ? and",
    "( d ) are there any limitations when working with data of this steady - state form ( no temporal correlation between different configurations ) ?",
    "related work has occurred on two separate fronts - obtaining effective alrs and network reconstruction . principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "is a widely used technique for two broad purposes : dimensionality reduction and estimating alrs .",
    "we provide a brief review of pca in section  5 which is required for describing our method",
    ". the simpler problem of obtaining alrs is well studied and considered solved under mild assumptions  @xcite .",
    "however it is also well known that interpreting these relationships and obtaining physical insights is a hard task  @xcite .",
    "this is largely because of a _ rotation ambiguity _ which is a result of choosing an orthogonal basis set ( chosen adaptively based on data ) to represent the alrs , which may not posses a direct physical interpretation .    to provide physical meaning to the discovered alrs ,",
    "different methods have been proposed .",
    "one of the most successful among these is based on the notion that a sparse representation is likely to provide better physical interpretation .",
    "though this is intuitive and has been successful , it does not solve all problems .",
    "for instance , in our problem , though the model we wish to recover ( i.e. @xmath4 ) is sparse - it also possess other important structural properties .",
    "thus a sparse representation by itself does not necessarily solve the problem .",
    "the structure of sparsity pattern is also of great importance .",
    "some problems in the realm of structured sparsity have also been studied recently  @xcite where the idea is to incorporate appropriate structural constraints in an optimization framework .",
    "however , some of these constraints can make the problem combinatorial , as in our case , which is generally handled through relaxations . in this work ,",
    "we however take a different approach .",
    "we try and transform the estimated model into a structured sparsity form instead of directly estimating the structured model . in our problem , this provides advantages like reduced computational effort , and more importantly lends itself to good theoretical understanding . for example , some of the questions raised at the end of section  1 can not be answered easily if we just use an optimization problem with structural constraints .",
    "for instance , it is difficult to characterize multiplicity of solutions or the connections between them .    on the other front",
    ", network reconstruction is generally studied in the context of dynamical systems and time - series data  @xcite .",
    "relevant examples include identifying plant topology or connectivity from time series measurements  @xcite , reconstruction of chemical reaction networks from data  @xcite etc .",
    "these exercises involve fitting an appropriate time series model ( like vector auto regressive models ) , and inferring connectivity from the coefficients of fitted models .",
    "however , obtaining the same connectivity information from steady state data is a difficult problem .",
    "this is again due to the rotation ambiguity . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    ", there has not been any work involving network reconstruction from edge flow measurements .",
    "this is likely because for a large number of applications , nodal throughput measurements are likely easier than measuring edge flows  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of reconstructing networks from edge measurements is important for theoretical completeness , and also serves as an example to illustrate that it may be possible to incorporate structure as a post processing step as opposed to incorporating structural constraints in the estimation step .",
    "also , edge measurements seem appropriate in newer applications like network tomopraphy  @xcite and we expect the proposed method to find more applications in the near future .",
    "we provide a concrete example to illustrate the problem we are trying to solve .",
    "consider the flow network shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have depicted representations which allows for _ dangling edges _ ( incident on only one node ) as well as closed representations of the same ( connect free end of all dangling edges to one _ environment _ node ) which is a standard practice in nearly all problems involving flow networks .",
    "there are a total of 6 flow variables ( @xmath18 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "assume noiseless measurements of all 6 edges .",
    "if flow conservation is active in the nodes , we can represent the relationships between @xmath19 as shown below .",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22        [ flow_network ]    given the flow data ( i.e. @xmath0 ) in table  1 , the objective is to use this data alone for reconstructing or inferring the underlying network topology . in this example",
    ", we have measurements corresponding to 7 different steady states ( i.e. @xmath23 ) .",
    ".flow data corresponding to network in fig .",
    "1 [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      when svd is applied to the data matrix @xmath24 from the example , we obtain the following singular values : @xmath25 this clearly indicates that there are 4 singular values close to 0 , thereby the data is in fact present in a two dimensional subspace of @xmath26 . in other words",
    "the data is constrained to lie in the null space of a @xmath27 matrix .",
    "we get the constraint relationships from : @xmath28 @xmath29    this estimate has been arrived at assuming no knowledge of the true error co - variance matrix , which is representative of the worst - case scenario .",
    "also , we have used svd instead of the more specialized techniques for heteroscedastic error co - variance to illustrate that the method works remarkably well even when only an approximate model is obtained - either from data alone or partially based on data , and partially based on process knowledge .",
    "clearly , this estimate ( @xmath30 ) is different from the true network matrix ( @xmath4 ) , and an element by element comparison is not possible .",
    "however , to check if the two matrices do indeed share the same row - space , narasimhan and shah  @xcite have proposed two criteria : ( i ) the subspace angle between the row subspace of the estimated and true constraint matrices , and ( ii ) the sum of orthogonal distances of the row vectors of the estimated constraint matrix from the subspace defined by the rows of the true constraint matrix .    1 .",
    "the subspace angle measures the maximum possible angle between the row sub - spaces spanned by the two matrices .",
    "for this example , we have a subspace angle of 0.0091 degrees . 2 .",
    "here we project @xmath30 on to the row space of @xmath4 , and use frobenius norm between the projection and @xmath30 for comparison . for the example , the frobenius norm was calculated to be @xmath31 .",
    "the above values suggest that the correct row - space was identified by pca .",
    "we now compare the regression ( @xmath32 ) matrix to show that it resolves the rotation ambiguity .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the choice for independent variables ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "2 @xmath36 + @xmath37    element wise comparison clearly shows us that pca has identified the correct row space .",
    "small deviations from the true values are due to noise which we added .      for the purpose of identifying the cut - sets , we perform the rref transformation on @xmath30 .",
    "the algorithm picked @xmath38 to form the spanning tree .",
    "the estimated and true cut - set matrices are :    2 @xmath39 + @xmath40    there is a clear element - wise correspondence between the two , and hence exact recovery of @xmath41 from data is possible .",
    "note that if the entries in @xmath42 have large deviations from acceptable values of @xmath43 , this is strong evidence that the original data generating process was not a network .      after obtaining @xmath44 from data , rounding off , and ignoring signs",
    ", we obtain the sparsity pattern of the cut - set ( @xmath45 ) which can be used to identify the topology of underlying undirected graph .",
    "@xmath46 let @xmath47 denote the incidence matrix of underlying undirected graph .",
    "each column of @xmath47 has utmost two non - zero entries , which are equal to @xmath48 .",
    "we observe that the above form has more than two non - zero entries in columns 4 and 5 .",
    "we hence perform the matrix operation : @xmath49 and perform mod  2 arithmetic ( i.e. set all elements with value 2 equal to 0 ) we get : @xmath50     +    this is in an acceptable network form , and the underlying undirected structure has been recovered . since the structure has now been obtained , it is trivial to perform linear regression with this particular structure to obtain the direction of edges .",
    "this can be done so by estimating a single equation corresponding to only the variables present in each row .",
    "the signs of elements in the first row are chosen arbitrarily , and this fixes the signs of all the rows since each column has exactly one positive and one negative entry ( including the environment node ) . if the true data generating process was a network , we expect to get a consistent set of entries without any clashes .",
    "the reconstructed network is shown in fig .  3 and the corresponding reduced indidence matrix is : @xmath51 we can see that this graph is different from the original one we started out with .",
    "however , the two are completely indistinguishable using flow conservation equations , and both could have generated the data in an equally plausible manner .",
    "it is also trivial to verify that the two networks are indeed 2-isomorphic .",
    "this can be done by obtaining the rref of both @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and they would be identical . on the other hand , if we had stacked the variables in an alternate manner ( this corresponds to reordering or renaming the edges , i.e. 1-isomorphism ) as @xmath54 the corresponding undirected cut - set matrix we would obtain after going through the pca and rref sequence would be : @xmath55 }      1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\      \\end{block } \\end{blockarray}\\ ] ] performing @xmath56 followed by @xmath57 , we have the following incidence matrix .",
    "@xmath58 }      1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\      \\end{block } \\end{blockarray}\\ ] ] this corresponds to exactly the network we originally used , subject to the same column permutations ( i.e. the two graphs are 1-isomorphic ) .",
    "this can be verified by permuting the columns of the original incidence matrix accordingly and comparing element wise with @xmath59 .",
    "the problem of graph realization from circuits and cut - sets received much attention during the 1980s , but have since remained dormant .",
    "further work on this problem , and more intuitive and efficient algorithms for the same , would prove very useful , given the data deluge today .",
    "we have shown in this work that graph realization is an indirect method for estimating network models from data , which is a very important problem today in a number of fields of fields - from economics to biology .",
    "we also believe that the proposed method can be extended to a larger set of structured models , in particular the stoichiometry matrix reconstruction .",
    "this would provide an alternate method to cross - verify or reconstruct chemical reaction networks using only steady state data .",
    "also , it may be possible to ascertain the direction of edges after recovering the underlying undirected network topology by just looking at the structure of the signed circuit matrix , and performing a loop traversal .",
    "work on this front could help in reducing one step in the proposed sequence .",
    "a polynomial time algorithm for network identification from steady state flow data was developed .",
    "the method involves a sequence of procedures summarized in fig .  2 .",
    "the major components are pca ( or svd ) followed by obtaining the cut - set matrix ( in reduced row echelon form ) and finally graph realization .",
    "the edge directions are ascertained using linear regression .",
    "this problem finds application in variety of fields like network topology reconstruction in distribution systems like water and power , and with further work in areas like economics and systems biology . the overall procedure is polynomial time , with the most expensive step being the singular valued decomposition of the data matrix , which can be obtained in @xmath60 where @xmath10 is the number of edges ( or fluxes ) and @xmath11 is the number of distinct steady state data collected  @xcite .",
    "we revisit the questions raised in section  i and answer them :    1 .",
    "network reconstruction is possible when entries in @xmath44 are not far off from acceptable values of @xmath61 , @xmath48 or @xmath62 , and the structure is compatible to a network .",
    "this is determined by graph realization algorithms  @xcite .",
    "we need at least @xmath16 steady states for reconstruction .",
    "since the value of @xmath16 may not be known upfront , a safe estimate would be @xmath10 distinct steady states .",
    "the realized network is unique only up - to 2-isomorphism .",
    "any further resolvability is not possible from steady state data alone .",
    "causality can not be determined as expected - reversing the direction of every edge yields an equally plausible network .",
