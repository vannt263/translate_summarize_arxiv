    "as the cells produce the signal substance , the movement may lead to an aggregation of cells .",
    "the more cells are aggregated , the more the attracting chemical signal is produced by the cells .",
    "this process is counter - balanced by cell diffusion , but if the cell density is sufficiently large , the nonlocal chemical interaction dominates and results  in two and three space dimensions  in a blow up of the cell density ( see the reviews @xcite for details ) . denoting by @xmath1 the cell density and by @xmath2 the concentration of the chemical signal , the keller - segel model , in its general form ,",
    "is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is a bounded domain , @xmath6 is the cell diffusivity , @xmath7 the chemotactic sensitivity , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe the production and degradation of the cell density and chemical substance , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath10 corresponds to the parabolic - elliptic case and @xmath11 to the fully parabolic problem .",
    "the equations are supplemented by homogeneous neumann boundary and initial conditions : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the exterior unit normal to the boundary @xmath14 ( which is assumed to exist ) .",
    "the classical keller - segel model consists in the choice @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .    motivated by numerical and modeling issues , the question",
    "how blow up of cells can be avoided has been investigated intensively the last years . up to our knowledge , four methods have been proposed . in the following",
    ", we review these methods .",
    "the first idea is to modify the chemotactic sensitivity .",
    "supposing that aggregation stops when the cell density reaches the maximal value @xmath19 , one may choose @xmath20 . in this volume - filling case ,",
    "the cell density is bounded , @xmath21 , and the global existence of solutions can be proved @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath22 with @xmath23 , the solutions are global and bounded , thus preventing finite - time blow up @xcite .",
    "global solutions are also obtained when the sensitivity depends on the chemical concentrations in an appropriate way , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a second method consists in modifying the cell diffusion . in the context of the volume - filling effect , burger et al .",
    "@xcite suggested the cell equation @xmath24 .",
    "then the parabolic - elliptic model possesses global solutions .",
    "global existence results can be achieved by employing the nonlinear diffusion @xmath25 , which models the local repulsion of cells .",
    "when @xmath26 grows faster than @xmath27 for large @xmath28 , a priori estimates showing that solutions are global and uniformly bounded in time were obtained in @xcite . adding the nonlinear sensitivity @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , global existence results were achieved in @xcite .",
    "the solutions are uniformly bounded in time if @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the existence of global bounded classical solutions to a fast - diffusion keller - segel model with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , has been proved in @xcite .",
    "the same result holds true when we choose @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and the solution is still global in time ( but possibly not classical ) if @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "a third approach is to consider nonvanishing growth - death models @xmath38 , since one may expect that a suitable death term avoids cell aggregation . indeed , taking @xmath39 for some @xmath40 , the global existence of solutions is proved in @xcite . in the logistic - growth model @xmath41",
    ", a global weak solution exists for all @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "these results have been obtained for the parabolic - elliptic model .",
    "recently , a fourth way to obtain global existence of solutions has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the idea is to add a cross - diffusion term in the equation for the chemical signal : @xmath43 where @xmath44 . at first sight",
    ", the additional cross - diffusion term seems to cause several mathematical difficulties since the diffusion matrix of the above system is neither symmetric nor positive definite , and we can not apply the maximum principle to the equation for the chemical signal anymore .",
    "all these difficulties can be resolved by the observation that the above system possesses a logarithmic entropy , @xmath45dx,\\ ] ] allowing for global existence results and revealing some interesting structural properties of the system .",
    "in fact , the entropy production equation @xmath46 and suitable gagliardo - nirenberg estimates for the right - hand side lead to gradient estimates for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "another motivation for the introduction of the additional cross diffusion is that , whereas finite - element discretizations of the classical keller - segel model break down some time before the blow up , the numerical solutions to the augmented model exists for all time , which may lead to estimates of the blow - up time .",
    "this question is currently under investigation .    in @xcite ,",
    "the existence of global weak solutions has been proved in the two - dimensional situation only . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this result to three space dimensions by allowing for nonlinearities in the cell diffusion terms . since nonlinear diffusion in the cell equation helps to achieve global existence results ( see above ) , we suggest , in contrast to @xcite , a _ nonlinear _",
    "cross - diffusion term .",
    "more precisely , we consider the equations @xmath49 subject to the no - flux and initial conditions @xmath50 notice that these boundary conditions are equivalent to @xmath51 on @xmath14 for smooth positive solutions .    in two space dimensions , the case @xmath52",
    "is covered by @xcite .",
    "if @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the nonlinear diffusion already prevents blow - up of the solutions without additional cross diffusion , see @xcite .",
    "the question remains if we can allow for linear and fast diffusion of cells , @xmath55 , for some @xmath56 , and still obtain global existence results . in this paper , we show that this is indeed true .",
    "for instance , we show that in the presence of the additional cross diffusion term and in three space dimensions , we can allow for the classical cell diffusion exponent @xmath57 and still obtain global existence results .",
    "this shows that the result of @xcite can be generalized to the three - dimensional case if the cross diffusion is of degenerate type .",

    "to be well defined . for the parabolic - elliptic system ,",

    "we recall that solutions to the classical parabolic - elliptic keller - segel model ( @xmath57 and @xmath556 ) blow up in finite time when the initial mass @xmath563 is sufficiently large .",
    "more precisely , in the radial case , under an additional assumption on the second moment , the solution blows up if @xmath564 @xcite or , in the non - radial case , if @xmath565 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath566 leads to global existence results for the parabolic - elliptic system @xcite , one may conjecture that the cell density of the parabolic - parabolic model blows up in finite time for @xmath564 if @xmath567 .",

    "however , we observed numerical difficulties for large values for @xmath137 ( e.g.  @xmath575 ) which may indicate that the upper bound for @xmath137 in terms of @xmath136 is more than just a technical assumption .",
    "we see from figure [ fig.nd2 ] that the larger the value of @xmath137 , the more regular the solution becomes , at least in the tested parameter range for @xmath137 .    in the limit of vanishing additional cross - diffusion @xmath576",

    "the cell density reaches its maximum at the boundary ( see figure [ fig.nd2 ] ) , whereas the maximum is attained in the interior of the domain for very small values of @xmath138 .",

    "we consider the linear case @xmath57 and prescribe the initial data @xmath577 see figure [ fig.ic2 ] ( left ) . in three space dimenions , even for the parabolic - elliptic system , there is no critical threshold known for the occurence of blow up .",
