    "this review article exclusively discusses exciton - polaritons in microcavity systems .",
    "the excitons , which are bosonic composite quasi - particles consisting of an electron and a hole bound via their coulomb attraction in a semiconductor , can be confined in quantum well ( qw ) structures embedded in optical microcavities .",
    "if the conditions for strong light - matter coupling are fulfilled , the properties of the bosonic matter excitation and the photon light field inside the microcavity are mixed , and new eigenstates of the coupled system evolve @xcite . being bosonic quasi - particles , polaritons can in principle condense in a single particle energy state of finite size @xcite .",
    "this dynamical condensation of bosons is closely related to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) phase which is usually studied in ultra - cold atomic systems @xcite .",
    "however due to the finite lifetimes of polaritons stored even in state - of - the - art microcavities , thermal equilibrium between the polaritons and their environment is very hard to establish .",
    "nevertheless , long - range spatial @xcite and temporal @xcite coherence of polariton condensates has been demonstrated , revealing signatures of a bec @xcite .",
    "the effective mass of a microcavity polariton is approximately 5 orders of magnitude smaller than that of a free electron and 8 - 9 orders smaller than that of an atom .",
    "since the critical temperature for the bose condensation scales inversely with the particle mass @xcite , polaritons are well suitable for studies of condensation in the temperature range from liquid helium up to even room temperature .",
    "polaritons exist in a semiconductor microcavity environment , hence their properties can be tailored by means of semiconductor lithography and nanotechnology .",
    "tailoring polaritonic systems via spatial trapping of excitons and/or photons in real and momentum space enables to control and manipulate these quasi - particles , and therefore can open completely new areas of mesoscopic physics in semiconductors . while photons have to be confined in a cavity to realize sufficiently long lifetimes to form polaritons , the excitons which we consider in this article are usually located in quantum wells to enhance the oscillator strength of the emitters and to reduce possible detrimental effects of surface recombination .",
    "consequently , polaritons which are generated in the above mentioned manner are quasi - particles living in a two - dimensional environment of a quantum well - microcavity system . in order to allow for the observation of phase transitions related to bose - einstein condensation at finite temperatures ,",
    "the exciton - polariton system should be of finite size , since otherwise the condensate s long range order would be destroyed by thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this condition is usually assured by the finite area of optical ( or electrical @xcite ) excitation .",
    "engineering of additional lateral traps in the semiconductor yields the possibility to create sophisticated potential landscapes on the order of the polariton wavelength ( on the order of 1 @xmath0 m ) , and therefore to study interactions and transport of tailored condensates in complex environments .",
    "this possibility , in turn , can be exploited in designing new schemes of highly nonlinear photonic integrated circuits ( pics ) and logic elements @xcite .",
    "such pics promise ultra high processing speeds at very low power consumption , since polaritons can propagate with ultrafast velocities and low decoherence rates in the semiconductor .",
    "the inherently high non - linearities borrowed from the excitonic components allow to manipulate @xcite , switch and steer the polariton flow with very weak additional laser beams @xcite and possibly electrical contacts .",

    "polariton gases in microcavities are considered as promising candidates for solid state quantum emulation , as they fulfil a range of important prerequisites : they can form bosonic condensates and enter a superfluid phase @xcite they possess internal ( pseudo - spin ) degrees of freedom , and as we will further assess in great detail , they can be localized by lithographic or optical techniques possibly down to the single polariton level , and their interaction constants are tunable @xcite .",
    "one example of progress towards quantum emulation are periodic potential landscapes , where higher - band p- and d - orbital like condensates mimic the fundamental structure of high temperature superconductors @xcite , offer the possibility to study dirac cones @xcite , and are predicted to implement bose - hubbard hamiltonian physics in semiconductors @xcite .",

    "this effect would allow to exploit the fascinating properties of polaritons in integrated quantum light sources , sources of entangled and indistinguishable photons @xcite , and to generate polariton number states in microcavity traps .",
    "the latter effect could pave the way for the study of quantum phase transitions and bose - hubbard physics with light , which yield the potential to open new areas in the field of solid state microcavity research .",
    "however , the experimental demonstration of polariton quantum blockade critically relies on the tight trapping of polaritons to enhance polariton - polariton interactions @xcite or controlled coupling of polariton boxes to facilitate quantum interference @xcite .",
    "the experimental and technological difficulties are significant , and consequently the effect has not been demonstrated yet .",

    "the typical cavity hosting exciton - polaritons is composed of layers with different refractive indices , such as alas and ( al)gaas .",
    "if the thicknesses of the individual layers are chosen to match the bragg condition , @xmath18 , then in such a dbr , interference of transmitted and reflected light allows to achieve extraordinary high reflectivity in a spectral window with a width of about 100 nm around the bragg wavelength . in order to form a cavity based on such reflectors , a photonic defect layer has to be included .",

    ". theoretical description of the exciton - polaritons in the engineered potentials below condensation threshold generally relies on calculating the eigenstates of photons and excitons under respective confinement conditions and then using the exciton - photon interaction hamiltonian to derive the corresponding polariton dispersion .",

    "the confinement of polaritons in such a structure can be rather accurately modeled by calculating the single particle energy levels in a finite , cylindrically symmetric ( polariton ) potential well . the ( lateral ) well depth is given by the height of the mesa ( and the according shift in the bragg resonance energy ) .",

    "noteworthy , it is found that the phonon relaxation between localized levels in the trap is enhanced ( compared to 2d samples ) as a consequence of momentum space selection rules , whereas energy transfers between 2d and 0d polaritons are strongly suppressed .",
    "consequently , it is suggested that , under non - resonant excitation conditions , the 0d polariton states have to be directly populated from the exciton reservoir , rather than from the 2d polaritons .",
