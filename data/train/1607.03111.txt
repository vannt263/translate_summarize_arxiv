    "<S> because of the assumption of strong rapidity ordering between the emissions , this algorithm ensures that @xmath39 is free from subleading effects . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that as long as emissions are strongly ordered in rapidity , the clustering history only depends on the rapidity ordering among emissions , and not on the actual rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> the above algorithm is used whenever emissions are soft - collinear and widely separated in angle , even beyond nll order . in particular it can be used to compute the nnll soft - collinear correction @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this function is made of two contributions with different physical origins : @xmath71 the term @xmath72 accounts for nnll effects in the coupling which have been neglected in @xmath39 , while the term @xmath73 contains nnll corrections due to implementing the exact rapidity bound ( @xmath74 ) for a _ single _ emission @xmath75 of the soft - collinear ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> while the running - coupling correction @xmath72 can be computed using the strongly - ordered algorithm defined above , in complete analogy with event - shape observables  @xcite , the rapidity correction @xmath73 requires some care . </S>",
    "<S> since the exact rapidity bound for the emission @xmath75 ( @xmath74 ) is larger than the nll bound shared by the other emissions @xmath30 ( @xmath76 ) , the rapidity correction will be non - zero only if the rapidity of emission @xmath75 is the largest of all . </S>",

    "<S> note that this issue is irrelevant for event shapes since they are independent of the rapidity fractions , and that the derivation of the rapidity correction given here can be equally applied in that case . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the discussion of the nnll clustering correction @xmath77 , which describes configurations in which at most two of the independently - emitted , soft - collinear partons have similar rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath78 and @xmath79 these two emissions . the function @xmath80 accounts for the difference between the observable @xmath81 in which @xmath78 and @xmath79 are close in rapidity , and the nll observable @xmath82 in which they are assumed to be far apart . </S>",
    "<S> this correction appears whenever the observable depends on the emissions rapidity fractions , hence it is absent in the case of event shapes . </S>",
    "<S> its formulation is analogous to the corresponding correction derived for the jet - veto resummation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and is reported in  @xcite . the algorithm that defines @xmath83 proceeds as the nll one , with an additional condition to be checked after step 1 :    * let @xmath84 and @xmath85 be the pseudo - particles containing the partons @xmath78 and @xmath79 . if these pseudo - particles are close in rapidity ( i.e. if neither @xmath78 nor @xmath79 have been recombined with a pseudo - particle with larger @xmath86 ) , check whether @xmath84 and @xmath85 cluster , i.e. if @xmath87 is satisfied , where @xmath88 . if so , recombine @xmath84 and @xmath85 by adding transverse momenta vectorially , and setting the rapidity fraction of the resulting pseudo - particle @xmath63 to @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> the same algorithm is employed in the computation of the nnll correlated correction @xmath44  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see  @xcite for details ) .    in a similar way we approximate the original algorithm to compute the remaining nnll corrections </S>",
    "<S> whose definition follows exactly the one given for event shapes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the considerations made so far for the durham case can be straightforwardly adapted to any other rirc jet algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the cambridge algorithm the nnll logarithmic structure is much simpler . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the ordering variable   only depends on the angular distance between emissions . since at nll </S>",
    "<S> all partons are well separated in rapidity , there will be no clustering between the emissions , and each of them will be recombined with one of the born legs in an angular - ordered way . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore obtains the trivial result @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the same arguments imply that the nnll corrections @xmath91  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both the recoil and the wide - angle corrections admit a simple analytic form given that the emission emitted either at wide angles or collinearly will never cluster with any of the other soft - collinear emissions . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from this emission factorizes with respect to the remaining ensemble  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same property applies to the clustering and correlated corrections which can be entirely formulated in terms of the clustering condition between two soft - collinear emissions  @xcite , analogously to the jet veto resummation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the freezing condition present in the cambridge algorithm does not play a role at nnll </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the ao version of the durham algorithm coincides with the cambridge algorithm at this order , while the two differ at nnlo .    </S>",

    "<S> however , we have not been able to obtain stable enough predictions to carry out this test . ]        </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the impact of our calculation by matching the nnll two - jet rate   to the @xmath94 result obtained with the program eerad3  </S>",

    "<S> this also ensures that the distribution vanishes at the kinematical endpoint @xmath100 , taken from the nnlo result . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the variation of @xmath98 probes the size of subleading logarithmic effects . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical uncertainties are obtained by varying , one at the time , @xmath98 and the renormalization scale @xmath101 by a factor of two in either direction around the central values @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and taking the envelope of these variations .    for the durham algorithm , </S>",
    "<S> as expected , we observe a significant reduction of the theory error when going from nll to nnll . on the contrary , for the cambridge algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , nnll corrections are quite large , and the nnll uncertainty is larger than the nll one , which in turn seems to be underestimated . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be understood by observing that the nll prediction for the cambridge algorithm does not contain any information about multiple emissions effects since no clustering occurs at this order and @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> these effects appear only at nnll , explaining the sizable numerical corrections . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the nll theory uncertainty as estimated in figure  [ fig : matched ] is unable to capture large subleading effects . </S>",
