    "the observation of resonant structures in the excitation functions for various combinations of light @xmath6-cluster ( n = z ) nuclei in the energy regime from the barrier up to regions with excitation energies of e@xmath13 = 20 - 50  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate  @xcite .",
    "these resonances have been interpreted for @xmath3c+@xmath3c  @xcite , the most favorable case for the observation of quasimolecular resonances @xcite , in terms of nuclear molecules .",
    "the question whether the well known @xmath3c+@xmath3c quasimolecular resonances represent true cluster states in the @xmath1 mg compound system , or whether they simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential is still unresolved  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with clustering phenomena , predicted from the cranked @xmath6-cluster model @xcite , the nilsson - strutinsky approach  @xcite , hartree - fock calculations  @xcite or other mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the relationship between superdeformation ( sd ) and nuclear molecules , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation ( with quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath14 @xmath15 0.6 ) for light nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes ( with @xmath14 @xmath15 0.9 ) - hyperdeformation ( hd ) - for actinide nuclei has also been widely discussed @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "various decay branches of highly excited @xmath1mg@xmath16 resonant states from @xmath3c+@xmath3c , including the emission of @xmath6-particles or heavier fragments , are energetically favored .",
    "however , @xmath0-decays have not been observed so far , and the @xmath0-ray branches are predicted to be rather small at these excitation energies .",
    "some old experiments have been reported @xcite , which have searched for these very small branching ratios expected to be in the range of @xmath17 of the total width  @xcite . very recently",
    "the radiative capture reaction @xmath3c+@xmath3c has been investiugated  @xcite .",
    "the rotational bands , from the knowledge of the measured spins and excitation energies , can be extended to rather low angular momenta , where finally the @xmath0-decay becomes a larger part of the total decay width .",
    "the population of such states in @xmath6-cluster nuclei , which lie below the threshold for fission decays and for other particle decays , is favored in binary reactions , where at a fixed incident energy the compound nucleus is formed at an excitation energy governed by the two - body reaction kinematics .",
    "these states may be coupled to intrinsic states in @xmath1mg@xmath2 populated by a break - up process ( via resonances ) as shown in refs.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1mg+@xmath3c reaction has been extensively investigated by several measurements of the @xmath3c(@xmath1mg,@xmath3c@xmath3c)@xmath3c break - up channel @xcite .",
    "resonant breakups are found to occur from specific states in @xmath1 mg at excitation energies e@xmath13 = 20 - 40  mev ( with spins ranging from j = 4@xmath18 to 14@xmath18 ) , which are linked to the ground state and also have an appreciable overlap with the @xmath3c+@xmath3c quasimolecular configuration .",
    "several attempts @xcite were made to link the @xmath3c+@xmath3c barrier resonances @xcite with the break - up states .",
    "the underlying reaction mechanism is now fairly well established @xcite and many of the barrier resonances appear to be correlated , indicating that a common structure is involved .",
    "this correlation strongly supports the hypothesis of the link between barrier resonances  @xcite in @xmath3c+@xmath3c , and secondary minima in the compound cucleus ( cn ) @xmath1 mg @xcite .",
    "large quadrupole deformations ( @xmath14  =  0.6 - 1.0 ) and @xmath6-clustering in light n = z nuclei are known to be general phenomena at low excitation energy . for high angular momenta and higher excitation energies ,",
    "very elongated shapes are expected to occur in @xmath6-like nuclei for a@xmath19 = 20 - 60 .",
    "these predictions come from the generalized liquid - drop model , taking into account the proximity energy and quasi - molecular shapes  @xcite .",
    "in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been recently discovered in several such n = z nuclei , in particular , @xmath20ar @xcite and @xmath21ca @xcite using @xmath0-ray spectroscopy techniques .",
    "hyperdeformed ( hd ) bands in @xmath20ar nucleus and its related ternary clusterizations are theoretically predicted @xcite . with",
    "the exception of the cluster decay of @xmath22zn @xcite and @xmath23ni @xcite recently studied using charged particle spectroscopy , no evidence for ternary breakup has yet been reported @xcite in light nuclei ; the particle decay of @xmath20ar sd bands ( and other highly excited bands ) is still unexplored .",
    "the main binary reaction channels of the @xmath1mg+@xmath3c reaction , for which both quasimolecular structures @xcite and orbiting phenomena @xcite have been observed , is investigated in this work by using charged particle-@xmath0-ray coincidence techniques .",

    "ii describes the experimental procedures and the data analysis .",

    "we end with a summary of the main results and brief conclusions in sec .",
    "the study of charged particle-@xmath0-ray coincidences in binary reactions in inverse kinematics is a unique tool in the search for extreme shapes related to clustering phenomena . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the @xmath1mg+@xmath3c reaction with high selectivity at a bombarding energy e@xmath5(@xmath1 mg ) = 130 mev by using the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) @xcite in coincidence with the euroball iv ( eb )  @xcite @xmath0-ray spectrometer installed at the vivitron tandem facility of strasbourg @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 mg beam was produced and accelerated by the vivitron , negative mgh@xmath24 ions were extracted from the ion source and then the mgh molecules were cracked at the stripping foils of the terminal accelerator . the beam intensity was kept constant at approximately 5 pna .",
    "the targets consisted of 200 @xmath25g/@xmath26 thick foils of natural @xmath3c .",
    "the effects of heavy contaminants ( mainly @xmath27cu and smaller traces of w isotopes ) have been estimated to be negligible .",
    "the presence of oxygen in the @xmath3c target was not significant ( less than @xmath15 1@xmath28 ) .",
    "the choice of the @xmath29 reaction implies that for an incident beam energy of e@xmath5 = 130  mev an excitation energy range up to e@xmath2 = 30  mev in @xmath1 mg is covered  @xcite .",
    "the euroball iv @xmath0-ray spectrometer , as shown in fig .  1 , consisted of two rings of a total of 26 clover - ge - detectors each composed of four ge crystals @xcite located at angles around 90@xmath30 , and 15 cluster - ge - detectors @xcite each consisting of seven ge crystals at backward angles .",
    "the inner bgo scintillator array was removed .",
    "the brs , in conjunction with eb , gives access to a novel approach for the study of nuclei at large deformations as described below .",
    "the brs associated with eb combines as essential elements two large - area ( with a solid angle of 187 msr each ) heavy - ion gas - detector telescopes in a kinematical coincidence setup at forward angles .",

    "the brs positions were calibrated using the elastic scattering data along with the known positions of slits in the movable mask in front of the brs telescope 1 .",
    "the two brs telescope arms are mounted symmetrically on either side of the beam axis , each covering the forward scattering angle range @xmath33@xmath34 = 12.5@xmath30 - 45.5@xmath30 , i.e. @xmath34 = 29@xmath30 @xmath35 16.5@xmath30 .",
    "for this reason the 30 tapered clover - ge - detectors of eb were removed .",
    "each brs gas - detector telescope comprises two consecutive gas volumes containing a two - dimensional position sensitive low - pressure multi - wire chamber ( mwc ) and a bragg - curve ionization chamber ( bic ) , respectively .",

    "are derived from the position ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) measurements .",
    "as already shown in previous studies @xcite , the in - plane angular correlations of two fragments need coincidence measurements for binary fission yields to be measured adequately .",
    "unfortunately , the mwc of brs telescope 2 could not provide us with a well functionning @xmath40-position signal ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , which is an essential information to check kinematical conditions of the out - of - plane correlations of ternary fission fragments . in the bics the bragg - peak height ( bp ) , range ( r ) , and kinetic energy ( e )",

    "3 displays a typical example of a two - dimensional bp vs e spectrum obtained for the @xmath1mg+@xmath3c reaction .",
    "energy calibrations were done using the energy loss program srim-2003 @xcite ( taking into account the window foils and gases ) to calculate the end - point energies ( punch - through ) observed in the bp vs e plots .",

    "the spectrum of fig .",
    "3 shows the excellent z discrimination ( the fragments with z = 6 , 8 and 10 are indicated with respective arrows ) achieved with the bics .",
    "it can be observed that , due to _ q_-value effects , the @xmath6-like @xmath3c , @xmath8o , @xmath7ne , @xmath1 mg and @xmath42si nuclei are preferentially populated compared to the odd z nuclei . this strong odd - even effect is a characteristic behavior of structure phenomena in @xmath3c+@xmath1 mg orbiting @xcite that may still survive at e@xmath5 = 130 mev .",
    "the gas pressure has been optimized to stop ions with z larger than 9 ( ejectiles with lower z s are not stopped in the bics as shown by their characteristic end point / punch - through in fig .",
    "the z=12 gate of fig .  3 has been used to select the @xmath0-ray spectrum measured in coincidence with @xmath1 mg nucleus ( see fig .",
    "other well - defined z gates can be used for the processing of the @xmath0-ray spectra in coincidence with the @xmath3c , @xmath8o , @xmath7ne and @xmath42si nuclei of interest .",
    "although mass identification has not been available in this experiment - i.e. the performance of the vivitron pulsing system was not better than 2ns ( fwhm ) - , the good energy resolution along with z - identification allowed the different reaction mechanisms to be clearly discriminated .",

    "more details of the detectors and the experimental set - up of the brs are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .      the excellent channel selection capability of binary and/or ternary fragments ( see for instance the two - dimensional angle versus energy spectrum plotted in fig",
    ".  4 for the @xmath6-transfer channel ) allows clear discrimination between the reaction channels , so that eb @xcite is used mostly with one- or two - fold multiplicities , for which the total @xmath0-ray efficiency is very high .",
    "the removal of the conventional 30 tapered clover - ge - detectors of eb from the forward angles had only a very small impact on reducing the overall eb efficiency ( less than 13@xmath28 of the total @xmath0-ray efficiency ) .",
    "although no specific measurements were done during two brs campaigns , the absolute total @xmath0-ray efficiency has been estimated to be approximately 8.5@xmath28 for the present eb experiment .",

    "the @xmath0 rays were doppler - shift corrected for the velocity of the identified outgoing binary fragments . the doppler - shift corrections yield an energy resolution better than 40 - 59  kev ( fwhm ) for 3 - 4  mev @xmath0 rays ( @xmath15 1.3 @xmath28 in average ) .",

    "the reason why the search for a direct @xmath0 decay in @xmath3c+@xmath3c has not been conclusive so far  @xcite is due to the excitation energy in @xmath1 mg as well as the spin region ( 8@xmath18  -  12@xmath18 ) which were probably chosen too high , as in radiative capture experiments  @xcite , for instance .",

    "one should keep in mind that the de - excitation spectra can be very different from the excitation ones .",
    "some degrees of freedom can have a major role in the excitation mechanism ( in matrix elements ) whereas they can play a minor one in the de - excitation processes , as the de - excitation process may , in fact , be dominated by very small components in the wave function .",
    "even if they are strongly excited by some open channels ( excitation ) , they can play a very small role in the actual @xmath0-ray spectra we see ( de - excitation ) . since this intra - band @xmath0 ray lies so far from the @xmath1 mg yrast line it is much more difficult to identify this band experimentally than it was for the analoguous sd bands in heavier nuclei such as @xmath20ar @xcite and @xmath21ca @xcite , for instance .",

    "other @xmath0 rays from @xmath67ne and @xmath68ne nuclei appear with increasing yields .",

    "the 5/2@xmath9 @xmath46 1/2@xmath24 transition of @xmath69o corresponds also to a multi - nucleon transfer ( i.e. 2_p_1_n _ ) process .",
    "it is also worth noting that feeding of the @xmath7ne states appears to saturate with increasing e@xmath2 , since binary decays decrease compared to sequential three - body decay channels such as @xmath8o+@xmath7ne@xmath2 @xmath46 @xmath8o+@xmath8o+@xmath6 .",
    "this saturation effect is known to occur for orbiting processes due to an angular momentum limitation as evidenced , for example , in @xmath42si+@xmath3c deep - inelastic collisions @xcite .    with appropriate doppler - shift corrections applied to oxygen fragments identified in the brs ,",
    "it has been possible to extend the knowledge of the level scheme of @xmath8o at high energies  @xcite , well above the @xmath3c+@xmath6 threshold ( 7.162  mev ) , which is given in fig .  8 ( dashed line ) for the sake of comparison .",
    "new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath9 state of @xmath8o at 11.085  mev @xmath35 3 kev .",
    "this state does not @xmath6-decay because of non - natural parity @xcite , in contrast to the two neighbouring 4@xmath9 states ( at 10.36  mev and 11.10  mev , respectively as indicated in fig .",

    "this result is important as it is the last known @xmath0-decay level for the well studied @xmath8o nucleus  @xcite .",
    "much more details on the gamma - decay width estimates can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    there is a renew interest in the spectroscopy of the @xmath8o nucleus at high excitation energy ( i.e. larger than 12 mev ) as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance . charged particle data @xcite have been recently re - analysed to study higher excitation energy 4@xmath6 states of the @xmath8o nucleus near the @xmath75be+@xmath75be ( 14.619 mev ) and @xmath3c+@xmath6 ( 14.611 mev ) decay thresholds . in the framework of the study of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xmath6-particle state in light",
    "n = z nuclei , the experimental signature of bec in @xmath8o is at present of the highest priority .",
    "an equivalent @xmath6+hoyle `` state in @xmath3c is predicted to be the 0@xmath76 state of @xmath8o at about 15.1 mev , which energy is just lying ( i.e. @xmath15 700 kev ) above the 4@xmath6-particle breakup threshold @xcite .",
    "however , any state in @xmath8o equivalent to the so - called ",
    "hoyle '' state in @xmath3c is most certainly going to decay by particle emission , with very small , probably un - measurable @xmath0-decay branches .",
    "very efficient particle - detection techniques will have to be used in the near future as such bec states will be expected to decay by alpha emission to the  hoyle \" state , and could be associated with resonances in @xmath6-particle ineastic scattering on @xmath3c leading to that state , or be observed in @xmath6-particle transfer to the @xmath75be-@xmath75be final state as observed by p. chevallier and coworkers back in the sixties @xcite .",
    "another possibility might be to perform coulomb excitation measurements with intense @xmath8o beams at intermediate energies .",
    "the connection of @xmath6-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) has been discussed in this work by using @xmath0-ray spectroscopy of coincident binary fragments from either inelastic excitations and direct transfers ( with small energy damping and spin transfer ) or from orbiting ( fully damped ) processes @xcite .",
    "exclusive data were collected with the binary reaction spetrometer ( brs ) in coincidence with euroball  iv installed formerly at the vivitron tandem facility of strasbourg .",
    "the search for the @xmath0-ray decay of a @xmath3c+@xmath3c molecule @xcite as populated by projectile breakup has been undertaken .",
    "the existence of intense high - energy @xmath0-rays in the e@xmath13  =  10 mev region in @xmath1mg@xmath2 strongly populated in the @xmath1mg+@xmath3c reaction is found to be of great interest .",
    "most of these @xmath0-rays may correspond to the doorway low - spin states recently observed in the radiative capture reaction @xmath3c(@xmath3c,@xmath0)@xmath1mg@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the striking selectivity of natural parity states in the @xmath1mg+@xmath3c exit - channel indicates that the orbiting processes dominant in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier  @xcite still survives at e@xmath5 = 130 mev . from a careful analysis of the @xmath8o+@xmath7ne @xmath6-transfer exit - channel",
    "( strongly populated by orbiting ) new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath9 state of @xmath8o at 11.089  mev .",
    "this result is encouraging for a complete @xmath0-ray spectroscopy of the @xmath8o nucleus at high excitation energy .",
    "of particular interest is the quest for the corresponding 4@xmath6 states near the @xmath75be+@xmath75be and @xmath3c+@xmath6 decay thresholds .",
    "the occurence of the collinear ternary decay from hyperdeformed shapes of @xmath23ni and @xmath22zn nuclei has been also investigated for @xmath20ar in the present work , but could not be firmly confirmed . however , this hypothesis in accordance with preliminary calculations performed in the framework of the generalized liquid - drop model @xcite will need further experimental investigations with higher selectivity .",
    "the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued exclusively using @xmath0-ray spectroscopy , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged particle spectroscopy in the near future ( see @xcite ) .",
