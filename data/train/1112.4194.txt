    "it have been discovered initially in @xcite and rediscovered later ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main feature of this solution is that the hubble parameter grows linearly in time , so it takes infinite time before it reaches infinity . in generalized modified gravity",
    "other forms of this solution are possible , in particular @xmath3 corrections in the action lead to @xmath4 solution @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of matter with some exotic equations of state or rather exotic functions @xmath1 leads to super - inflation with @xmath5 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite in these papers such solution is called as `` little rip '' . however , from physical point of view , ruzmaikin solution with its analogs and phantom solutions are not substantially different - both lead to planck density reached in finite time interval , and prolongation of the solution further in time has no any physical justification . both solution ,",
    "if realised in early epoch of universe evolution can precede inflation only being unstable .",
    "it should be noted that recently some models describing `` graceful exit '' from a phantom regime have been constructed @xcite , however , they are dealing with a phantom matter as a source of this regime , and can not be directly applied to @xmath1-cosmology .    in the present paper",

    "that is why existence of such regimes can only be guessed from the form of effective potential and should be checked explicitly . in the present paper",
