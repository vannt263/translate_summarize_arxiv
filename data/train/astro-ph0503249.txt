    "the heart of bolocam is an array of 144 silicon nitride micromesh ( `` spider - web '' ) bolometers cooled to 260 mk by a three - stage ( @xmath29he/@xmath30he/@xmath30he ) sorption refrigerator .",
    "an array of close - packed ( @xmath31 ) , straight - walled conical feed horns terminating in cylindrical waveguides and integrating cavities formed by a planar backshort couples the bolometers to cryogenic and room - temperature optics .",
    "the illumination on the 10.4 m diameter cso primary mirror is controlled by the combination of the feed horns and a cold ( 6 k ) lyot stop , resulting in 31  beams ( fwhm ) . a stack of resonant metal - mesh filters form the passband in conjunction with the waveguides .",
    "a @xmath32 mm configuration is also available , which is used for observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "technical details of bolocam are given in @xcite and @xcite ; numerical simulations of the integrating cavities are described in @xcite .",
    "a key element of bolocam is the bolometer bias and readout electronics : an ac biasing scheme ( 130 hz ) with readout by lock - in amplifiers enables the detectors to be biased well above the @xmath33 knee of the electronics .",
    "the electronic readout stability , in conjunction with bolocam s rigorous sky noise subtraction algorithm , eliminates the need to nutate the cso subreflector .",
    "another advantage of this ac biasing scheme is that it is easy to monitor the bolometer operating voltage ; these voltages are determined by the total atmospheric emission in the telescope beam and the responsivity of the bolometers .",
    "thus , a voltage that is a monotonic function of the in - band atmospheric optical depth and bolometer responsivity is continually measured .",
    "sky subtraction is implemented by either a subtraction of the average bolometer voltages or a principal component analysis ( pca ) technique , which is described below .",
    "two sets of observations of the lockman hole east ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , j2000.0 ) were made with bolocam : 2003 january , when the data were taken with a fast raster scan without chopping ( hereafter referred to as raster scan observations ) , and 2003 may , when the data were acquired with a slow raster scan with chopping as a test of this observing mode ( referred to as chopped observations ) .",
    "approximately 82 hr of integration time over 17 nights were obtained on the field during 2003 january , resulting in 259 separate observations , and 41 hr over 19 nights were obtained in 2003 may , resulting in 64 separate observations .",
    "the weather was generally good during the 2003 january run and mediocre to poor during the 2003 may run , where we characterize the weather quality by the sky noise variability ( rapid variability of the optical depth ) .",
    "ranges and 75th percentiles of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "] one hundred and nineteen bolometer channels were operational during 2003 may ; however , only 89 bolometer channels were used in the analysis of the 2003 january data .",
    "( the remaining bolometers were not included in making the final lockman hole map because of excess noise and/or electronics failures . )",
    "nominally one feed horn per hextant is blocked to enable these dark bolometers to be used for bias and noise monitoring .",
    "the 2003 may chopped observations were not deep enough to detect galaxies individually at @xmath40 and were used only for pointing verification by cross - correlation with the raster scan observations .    during 2003 january , observations were made by scanning the telescope at 60  @xmath41 in right ascension and stepping in declination by 162  ( @xmath13 of a field of view ) between subscans ( defined as a single raster scan across the sky at a fixed declination ) to build up the map .",
    "subsequent scans ( which we define as the set of subscans needed to cover the entire declination range of the field ) were taken with a @xmath42  jitter for each 162  step to minimize coverage variations .",
    "combined with a 5@xmath43 tilt of the bolometer array relative to azimuth and a fixed dewar angle , such that the rotation relative to scan direction varies over the night , this yielded even coverage and sub - nyquist sampling in the cross - scan direction ( declination ) .",
    "sub - nyquist sampling was automatically achieved in the in - scan direction ( right ascension ) with 50 hz sampling of the lock - in amplifiers . in 2003 may ,",
    "the chopped observations were made with raster scans in azimuth and steps in elevation , but with a scan rate of 5  @xmath41 and a symmetric chopper throw of @xmath44 in azimuth , with frequencies of 1 and 2 hz .",
    "a coverage map of the bolocam lockman hole east field from 2003 january is shown in figure [ fig : coverage ] , where the integration time per 10@xmath4510  pixel is shown .",
    "8field of view is not small compared to the map size ; thus , there is a large border around the map where the coverage is reduced and nonuniform compared to the central region .",
    "hence , we define a `` uniform coverage region '' of 324 arcmin@xmath0 in the center where the rms in the integration time per pixel is 12% . because rms noise varies as the square root of the integration time ,",
    "the noise dispersion is approximately 6% in the uniform coverage region ( 2% after the map has been optimally filtered as discussed in   [",
    "subsection : mapping ] ) .",
    "our analysis is confined to the uniform coverage region .",
    "the observational parameters are summarized in table [ table : observationalparameters ] .",
    "the lockman hole observations were reduced with a custom idl - based software pipeline .",
    "the raw files were cleaned with a pca sky subtraction , where an atmospheric and instrumental noise template was generated through an eigenvector decomposition of the time stream data (   [ subsection : cleaning ] ) . in the case of the chopped observations , which are characterized by both positive and negative beams ,",
    "the time streams were first demodulated followed by a convolution with the expected source crossing structure ( first the positive beam , then the negative beam ) .",
    "this results in a positive net peak at the nominal source position with the full source amplitude and symmetric negative beams with half the source amplitude .",
    "once the cleaned time streams were obtained , a map was generated by co - adding individual time streams , weighted by their power spectral densities ( psds ) integrated over the spectral response to a point source .",
    "pointing offsets were applied to individual observations from the global pointing model generated from observations of submillimeter pointing sources (   [ subsection : pointing ] ) .",
    "time streams were calibrated from lock - in amplifier voltages to millijanskys using observations of primary and secondary flux calibrators (   [ subsection : calibration ] ) .",
    "the final map was generated in right ascension and declination using sub - beam - sized pixelization (   [ subsection : mapping ] ) and wiener filtered to maximize signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for detections of point sources .      to facilitate removal of fluctuating atmospheric water vapor emission ( sky noise ) from the bolometer signals",
    ", bolocam was designed such that the feed horn beams overlap maximally on the primary mirror of the telescope and therefore sample very similar columns of atmosphere .",
    "thus , the sky noise , which dominates the fundamental instrument noise by a factor of @xmath17100 , is a nearly common - mode signal . to remove this correlated @xmath33 noise with maximum effectiveness",
    ", a pca technique was developed .",
    "the formalism of the pca analysis is standard ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the covariance matrix is built from the @xmath46 bolometers by @xmath47 time elements matrix for each subscan .",
    "eigenfunctions of the orthogonal decomposition that have `` large '' eigenvalues , corresponding to large contributions to the correlated noise , are nulled and the resulting functions are transformed back into individual bolometer time streams .",
    "this technique is applicable for the dim ( @xmath4810 mjy ) submillimeter galaxies of the lockman hole ( and other blank - field surveys ) because the source signal contributes negligibly to the sky templates and is largely uncorrelated from bolometer to bolometer .",
    "the pca technique is not appropriate for extended sources , however , in which case the bolometers see correlated astrophysical signals , which are then attenuated .",
    "the pca decomposition was applied to raster scan and chopped data , after chop demodulation in the latter case .",
    "cosmic - ray strikes ( spikes in the time streams ) are flagged and not included in constructing the eigenfunctions .",
    "the precise level of the cut on the large eigenvalues is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the greater the number of eigenfunctions that are nulled , the lower the resulting noise in the cleaned time stream , but the correspondingly greater source flux density removed . empirically , an iterative cut with the nulling of eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath40 from the mean of the eigenvalue distribution produced a balance between sky emission removal and source flux density reduction in simulated observations by maximizing the s / n .",
    "because the distribution of eigenvalues for each observation is characterized by a few outliers ( typically @xmath49 ) at large @xmath50-values , the overall variance of the time stream is largely dominated by these eigenvalues , resulting in a s / n that is insensitive to the cut threshold for @xmath51 @xmath50 . furthermore , the distribution of source candidates in the combined lockman hole map was invariant under variations in the cut threshold in this range .",
    "the pca sky subtraction attenuates the signal from point sources in addition to the atmospheric signal because it removes low - frequency power from the time streams .",
    "the amount of flux density attenuation is determined by the number of pca components that are removed from the raw time streams , which is controlled by the cut on the eigenvalues : a more aggressive cut results in greater attenuation .",
    "monte carlo simulations were done to determine the amount by which the flux density of galaxy candidates was reduced by the cleaning .",
    "the simulations were done in the following manner : a fake source ( gaussian , 31  fwhm ) was injected into a blank lockman hole map .",
    "a simulated bolometer time stream was generated from the map of the fake source and was added to the raw bolometer time streams of an individual lockman hole observation . the time stream data",
    "were then cleaned with pca and mapped in the ordinary manner .",
    "the resulting source was fitted by a two - dimensional gaussian to determine the attenuation of the injected source flux density .",
    "this simulation was repeated 1014 times with fake sources injected into random observations at random positions and ranging in flux density from 0.1 to above 1000 mjy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxreduction ] ) .",
    "the average reduction in flux density is 0.19 with an rms dispersion of 0.04 , independent of flux density to 1 jy .    above 1 jy , typical for bright pointing and flux calibrators ,",
    "the amount of attenuation by pca was found to depend on the brightness of the fake source .",
    "thus , a different cleaning technique was used for these sources .",
    "an atmospheric noise template was generated by simply taking an average of all @xmath46 bolometers for each time element .",
    "the mean - subtracted sky template was then correlated to each of the individual bolometer time streams and the correlated component was subtracted . to prevent the correlation coefficient from being contaminated by the calibrators , multiple scans ( including telescope turnaround time between scans ) were concatenated and used together to correlate the average sky template to each individual bolometer signal , thus ensuring a small contribution from the point source . a similar analysis to that for pca flux reduction",
    "was performed for the simple average sky subtraction technique , yielding an average flux density reduction of 0.07 , independent of source flux , with an rms dispersion of 0.02 .",
    "observations of planets , quasars , protostellar sources , h@xmath52 regions , and evolved stars were used to construct separate pointing models for the 2003 january and may observing runs .",
    "observations of the pointing sources were taken at the same scanning speeds as the lockman hole observations .",
    "the pointing fields were generally small ( scan areas of @xmath17 4x4 ) , although several larger maps ( 10x10 ) were made of mars so that the source would pass over the entire bolometer array for measuring relative responsivities and beam maps .",
    "pointing observations are generally small because source crossings are only needed in a small subset ( 15 or so ) of bolometers to determine the pointing offsets .",
    "these observations were used to map and correct the distortion over the field of view , which is in broad agreement with the distortion predicted by a zemax@xmath53 ray - tracing model .",
    "the residual rms in the raster - scanned pointing model for the ensemble of all 2003 january sources is 9.1 , although the local pointing registered to a nearby pointing source is superior .",
    "this random pointing error results in an 18% flux density reduction of the lockman hole galaxy candidates ( analytically derived from a convolution of the 31  bolocam beam with a 9.1  gaussian random pointing error ) , which is corrected for in the reported flux densities ( and uncertainties in these fluxes ) of table [ table : sourcelist ] .    while the 2003 january pointing observations were used to construct a pointing model that was applied to the entire sky , the region of the celestial sphere near the lockman hole was not well sampled .",
    "a pointing correction derived from sources far away ( @xmath54 ) from the lockman hole is therefore susceptible to a systematic offset .",
    "pointing observations were made much more frequently ( once per hour ) during the 2003 may run and sources near the lockman hole were emphasized to create an improved local pointing model ; consequently , the 2003 may pointing model near the lockman hole was superior to the 2003 january pointing model .",
    "no galaxy candidates were detected at @xmath55 significance in the 2003 may chopped lockman hole map owing to poor weather ; however , it was cross - correlated with the 2003 january map to compare the pointing models .",
    "the cross - correlation yielded a shift of 25  in right ascension of the 2003 january data with respect to the 2003 may data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crosscorrelation ] ) .",
    "because the pointing on the sky near the lockman hole was substantially better and more frequently sampled for the 2003 may run , we attribute this shift to a systematic offset in the 2003 january pointing model .",
    "thus , a systematic 25  shift in right ascension was applied to the 2003 january lockman hole map .",
    "the need for the shift is also apparent in a comparison between the bolocam map and the 8 mjy scuba 850 @xmath3 m and mambo 1.2 mm surveys , as several of the bolocam galaxy candidates become coincident with scuba and mambo sources in the overlap region of the surveys .",
    "because no pointing observations were taken near the lockman hole , it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty in the 9.1  pointing rms .",
    "an independent measurement of our pointing uncertainty was performed by examining both 10 vla radio positions coincident with bolocam lockman hole galaxy candidates and the subset of 5 sources with additional scuba and/or mambo counterparts ( see   [ subsection : ancillary ] ) .",
    "the rms errors between the bolocam and radio positions are @xmath56 and @xmath57 arcsec for the entire 10-source sample and 5-source subset , respectively .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are the minimum length 90% confidence intervals for 10 and 5 degrees of freedom ( for both @xmath58 and @xmath59 , each of which independently determines the pointing error ) , respectively .      observations of primary calibrators ( planets ) and secondary calibrators ( protostellar sources , h@xmath60 regions , and evolved stars ) were used for flux calibration .",
    "reference planetary flux densities were obtained from the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) calibration web site , and flux densities of secondary calibrators were obtained from jcmt calibrators @xcite .",
    "the flux density of irc + 10216 is periodic ; the flux density was adjusted to the epoch of observation using the 850 @xmath3 m scuba phase .",
    "the reference flux densities were corrected for the bolocam bandpass , which is centered at 265 ghz ( the flux densities in the bolocam band are 5% larger than the those quoted by the jcmt for the scuba 1.1 mm band ) . during 2003 january",
    ", saturn had a semidiameter of 10 ; this is not small compared to the 31  bolocam beam , so corrections for the angular extent of saturn were required .",
    "the standard technique for flux calibration is to calibrate a given science observation using the flux calibrator observations taken nearest in time , which were presumably taken at similar atmospheric opacity and air mass .",
    "with bolocam , we are able to use a more sophisticated technique via continuous monitoring of the bolometer operating resistance using the dc level of the lock - in amplifier output signal .",
    "the technique uses the following logic .",
    "the atmospheric optical loading increases as the atmospheric optical transmission decreases , which may occur because of changes in zenith opacity ( i.e. , weather ) or intentional changes in telescope elevation .",
    "the bolometer resistance decreases monotonically as the atmospheric optical loading increases .",
    "simultaneously , the bolometer responsivity decreases monotonically as the bolometer resistance decreases .",
    "thus , the flux calibration ( in nv jy@xmath2 , where the voltage drop across the bolometer is proportional to its resistance ) , which is proportional to the product of atmospheric transmission and bolometer responsivity , is expected to be a monotonic function of the bolometer resistance .",
    "this relation is measured empirically , as shown in figure [ fig : calibration ] , by plotting the flux calibration ( voltage at the bolometer in nv jy@xmath2 of source flux ) from each of the ensemble of calibrator observations against the median dc lock - in amplifier voltage measured during the observation .",
    "this relation is then combined with the continuously monitored dc lock - in signal to apply the appropriate flux calibration value during science observations .",
    "note that the curve is measured only using sources dim enough to ensure linear bolometer response ; jupiter was dropped for this reason .",
    "the flux density calibration derived from figure [ fig : calibration ] is biased relative to the blank - field sources by the combination of three effects : reduction in the flux density of calibration sources due to average cleaning , reduction in the flux density of blank - field sources due to pca cleaning , and reduction in the flux density of blank - field sources due to pointing errors .",
    "the first two effects cause the calibration curve of figure [ fig : calibration ] to be shifted up by the factor @xmath61 , where the flux reduction factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 are as determined in ",
    "[ subsection : cleaning ] .",
    "the effect of gaussian random pointing errors of rms @xmath64 on the peak flux density of a source observed with a gaussian beam of width @xmath65 is equivalent to a convolution of the beam with a gaussian of rms @xmath64 . the resulting reduction in peak height can be analytically calculated as @xmath66 for a 31  fwhm beam and a random pointing error of 9.1 .",
    "the uncertainty quoted for @xmath67 is the minimum length 90% confidence interval obtained from the rms pointing error between the bolocam galaxy candidates and coincident radio sources ( see  [ subsection : ancillary ] ) .",
    "( while the local pointing observations around a specific altitude and azimuth are clustered , each with a smaller pointing error rms , the lockman hole observations were taken over a large range of zenith and azimuthal angles and thus have an overall pointing error defined by the ensemble of pointing observations . )",
    "thus , the final bias in flux density is @xmath68 all flux densities ( as well as uncertainties in these fluxes ) quoted in this paper , including the simulations of  [ section : simulations ] , have been corrected for this flux bias .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux bias is a systematic effect that produces a correlated shift in all source fluxes .",
    "bolocam maps are built up by co - adding subscans weighted by their time stream psds integrated over the spectral ( temporal frequency ) band of a point source at the raster scan speed .",
    "data points were binned into 10@xmath45 10  pixels , with approximately 30,000 hits per pixel .",
    "each hit represents a 20 ms integration per bolometer channel .",
    "four maps were created : a coverage map with the number of hits per pixel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage ] ) ; the pca - cleaned , optimally filtered astrophysical map ; a coverage - normalized map ; and a within - pixel rms map . in the coverage - normalized map ,",
    "each pixel was multiplied by the square root of the number of hits ( effectively the integration time ) in that pixel to account for the nonuniform coverage in the map when comparing pixels .",
    "the dispersion of the bolometer voltages ( from each of the hits ) within each pixel was recorded in the within - pixel rms map .    because the signal band of interest ( point sources ) does not fall throughout the entire temporal ( or spatial ) frequency range of the psd of the data , we filter the co - added map with an optimal ( wiener ) filter , @xmath69 , to attenuate @xmath33 noise at low frequencies and high - frequency noise above the signal frequency : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the average psd",
    ", @xmath72 is the fourier transform of the bolocam beam shape from map space to spatial frequency ( @xmath73 ) space , @xmath74 , and the asterisk indicates complex conjugation .",
    "the factor in the denominator is the appropriate normalization factor so that when convolved with a map , peak heights of beam - shaped sources are preserved .",
    "@xmath71 is obtained by transforming the time stream psds ( averaged over all of the lockman hole observations ) to a spatial psd assuming azimuthal symmetry . a two - dimensional map of equation ( [ wiener ] ) was thus convolved with the co - added map to maximize s / n for detections of point sources .",
    "an analogous filter was applied directly to the demodulated time streams of the chopped observations , with @xmath75 represented by a positive and negative beam separated by the chop throw ( 90 ) .",

    "a comparison of the maps is given in ",
    "[ section : sourcelist ] .",
    "source extraction was performed on the pca - cleaned , optimally filtered , coverage - normalized map consisting of all the raster scan observations co - added together .",
    "the algorithm was begun by doing a cut on the uniform coverage region , defined as the set of those pixels for which ( 1 ) the coverage is @xmath78% of the maximum per pixel coverage and ( 2 ) the within - pixel rms is less than 2 @xmath50 from the mean within - pixel rms .",
    "the uniform coverage region is a contiguous region in the center of the map .",
    "next , an rms in sensitivity units ( the flux density of each pixel times the square root of the integration time for that pixel in units of mjy s@xmath79 ) was computed in the uniform coverage region .",
    "this rms is valid for the entire uniform coverage region since variations in coverage have been accounted for by the @xmath80 coverage normalization , where @xmath81 is the total integration time for pixel @xmath82 .",
    "all pixels with coverage - normalized flux densities exceeding @xmath83 ( `` hot pixels '' ) were flagged as potential sources",
    ". then hot pixels were grouped into multi - pixel sources by making the maximal group of adjacent hot pixels , including those within @xmath84 pixels ( i.e. , diagonally adjacent ) .",
    "the right ascension and declination of the source candidates were computed by centroiding two - dimensional gaussians on the groups . because convolution of the map with the wiener filter properly weights the flux contribution from each pixel ,",
    "the best estimate of the source flux density in the optimally filtered map is given by the peak value in the group .",
    "a histogram of the pixel values in the uniform coverage region is shown in figure [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "the quantity that is plotted is the pixel sensitivity , with the scaling by @xmath80 accounting for the nonuniform coverage in the map .",

    "statistical error bars on the completeness and bias determined from this simulation method include the contribution from the correlation .",
    "the pointing jitter dilutes the variance of sources present in the jittered map to 20% or less of its value in the unjittered map ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : jitter ] ) , effectively removing confusion noise .",
    "because of the large amount of time required to generate many realizations of maps from real time stream data ( as in the case of the jittered maps ) and the difficulties of fully simulating time stream realizations of instrument and atmospheric noise , a second simulation method was developed . in this method ,",
    "the noise properties are derived from the jackknife maps , which represent realizations of signal - free instrument noise .",
    "the noise model for the map ( before optimal filtering ) assumes that the noise map , @xmath123 , can be described as an independent noise per pixel that scales as @xmath124 , where @xmath81 is the integration time in pixel @xmath82 , combined with a mild pixel - to - pixel correlation .",
    "this correlation is assumed to be stationary over the map and can thus be described by the two - dimensional psd of the noise map @xmath125 , normalized so that its integral has unit variance .",
    "these assumptions are justified because , as shown in  [ section : sourcelist ] , the coverage variation accounts for most of the point - to - point variation in the noise , and examination of the jackknife map psd shows that the @xmath126 contribution to the psd is small compared to the white term , leading to largely uncorrelated pixels .",
    "the noise model for the map after wiener filtering is straightforwardly obtained by convolving the noise map with the wiener filter .",
    "the assumptions above are equivalent to writing the covariance matrix @xmath127 for the unfiltered map as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is diagonal in pixel space and describes the coverage variations , @xmath130 is diagonal in @xmath131-space and describes the pixel noise correlations , and @xmath132 is the discrete fourier transform .",
    "the elements of @xmath129 can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the sample variance of the noise and @xmath135 is a normalization that ensures that the sum of the pixel variances @xmath136 is equal to @xmath137 , the total noise variance in the map .",
    "the noise map should satisfy @xmath138 ; a given realization is @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a realization of uncorrelated , gaussian , mean zero , unit variance noise .",
    "determining the noise model then reduces to determining the form of @xmath141 and the value of @xmath50 .",
    "the psd @xmath142 is computed directly from the uniform coverage region of the unfiltered jackknife maps using the discrete fourier transform ; multiple jackknife realizations ( which are nearly independent ) and adjacent @xmath131-space bins are averaged to reduce the noise on the measurement of the psd .",
    "the overall noise normalization @xmath50 is determined by requiring that the variance of @xmath123 , when considered in the good coverage region , wiener filtered , and multiplied by @xmath143 , is equal to the variance similarly determined from the jackknife maps (   [ subsection : nulltests ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : jackknife ] ) .",
    "one thousand noise realizations were generated in this way .",
    "the false detections were determined by simply running the source detection algorithm on each of the simulated maps for both types of simulations and recording the number and recovered flux density of the detections .",
    "figure [ fig : falsedetections ] shows the results for both methods .",
    "also plotted is the theoretical prediction , assuming that the normalization @xmath122 is either @xmath144 or @xmath145 , which should bracket the possibilities .",
    "it is seen that neither gaussian model describes the simulated false detection rate well , although both methods of simulation agree well with each other .",
    "the gaussian model does not describe the simulation data well in either amplitude or shape .",
    "the amplitude discrepancy occurs because @xmath122 is the number of effective independent noise elements , which depends on both the correlations in the noise and the detection algorithm , which does not count all pixels above threshold as source candidates but considers all pixels within a merged group to be a single source .",
    "the shape of the gaussian model fits poorly owing to three effects : first , because of the coverage variation , the threshold is not sharply defined in flux density units , causing some false detections _ below _ the threshold .",
    "second , the grouping algorithm merges closely spaced false detections in the wiener - filtered map and assigns a single flux density to the brightest pixel , a conditional probability that is flux dependent .",
    "finally , the pixels are not independent , since both @xmath33 noise and the wiener filter correlate them . because of the difficulty in deriving an analytic expression for all these effects , the false detection rate as determined by simulation is used in further analysis ( see  [ subsection : modeldnc ] ) instead of the gaussian prediction .",
    "the mean number of false detections in the lockman hole map as determined from simulation is 6 ( poisson distributed ) . to find the completeness and bias , sources of known flux density were injected into the noise maps",
    "first , a source - only map was created by adding 30 31  fwhm two - dimensional gaussians at a specified flux density level to a blank map .",
    "the sources were injected at random into the uniform coverage region but were spaced far enough apart that the source detection algorithm could distinguish each of them ; this circumvented potential complications involving source confusion .",
    "then , the source - only map was added to a noise map to simulate a sky map post cleaning and mapping .",
    "next , this map was wiener filtered and run through the source extraction algorithm , which enabled us to determine which sources were detected and their resulting flux densities .",
    "each extracted detection was centroided to determine its position , and then its position was compared with the position of the nearest injected source .",
    "if the positions were within 15(roughly the distance between two adjacent , diagonal pixels ) , the extracted detection was considered real .",
    "the flux density was determined by the maximum value of detected pixels , as is appropriate for the wiener - filtering algorithm .    with these mechanics in place ,",
    "the completeness was calculated by computing the ratio of the number of detections at a given flux to the number of injected sources .",
    "this was repeated for source flux densities ranging from 2.8 to 9.8 mjy for simulations from map statistics and from 1.4 to 9.8 mjy for jittered data simulations in 0.7 mjy intervals , with the results plotted in figure [ fig : completeness ] .",
    "the two types of simulations agree well .",
    "the survey completeness is 50% at the 3 @xmath50 detection threshold , as expected , because half of the sources at the threshold will be bumped upward by noise and half will be bumped downward .",
    "the simulations also agree with the theoretical prediction for gaussian noise .",
    "the bias was computed by determining the distribution of measured flux densities as a function of injected flux densities . at relatively large flux densities",
    ", the bias distribution should approach a gaussian distribution centered at the injected flux density , with @xmath50 equal to the map rms .",
    "this is seen to be the case in figure [ fig : bias ] for injected flux densities @xmath146 mjy .",
    "the figure gives the distribution of the expected observed flux densities ( probability density per flux bin , normalized to an integral of unity ) for a range of injected flux densities . for low injected flux densities approaching the detection threshold ,",
    "the distributions become increasingly asymmetric owing to the presence of the threshold .",
    "the distributions do not drop abruptly to zero below the threshold because there are variations in the map coverage .",
    "note that sources with true flux below the detection threshold may be detected . the average bias for a source is shown in figure [ fig : bias ]",
    "; this rises steeply for sources with fluxes near or below the detection threshold .    the preceding discussion ( in particular the agreement of the simulated bias and completeness with the gaussian theoretical prediction ) indicates that , in spite of coverage variations and correlated noise , the noise in this survey behaves substantially like uniform gaussian noise",
    ". comparison of the results of the map simulation method with the jitter technique also shows good agreement , indicating that the assumptions that went into the map simulation method are justified and that we have a reasonable model for the survey noise .",
    "this gives added confidence to the determination of the false detection rate , which depends only on the noise properties .",
    "the completeness and bias function estimates as determined in   [ subsection : noisemaps ] and [ subsec : surveycalculations ] do not include the effects of confusion noise .",
    "the effect of confusion noise is illustrated by considering two extremes : instrument noise dominant over confusion noise and vice versa .",
    "when instrument noise is dominant , the bias function for this survey is correctly described by equation ( [ eq : gaussianbias ] ) . in the confusion - dominated limit ,",
    "the bias function takes on the shape of the source count distribution , reflecting the fact that it is the underlying distribution of sources that may bias the flux of a given source . in between these two extremes ,",
    "the gaussian bias function acquires additional width and a long positive tail from the source counts distribution .",
    "this tail increases the probability that a low flux source will fluctuate above the detection threshold .",
    "consequently , the completeness at low flux densities is increased over the case of gaussian noise .",
    "note that small changes in the bias tail can cause large changes in the subthreshold completeness .",
    "the case at hand falls in this in - between regime .",
    "understanding the modification to the bias function by confusion noise is necessary for accurately estimating how confusion transforms a model source count distribution to an observed one , as in equation ( [ eq : finaldnc ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to precisely model the effects of confusion on bias and completeness because they depend on the source count distribution that one is trying to measure .",
    "we can estimate the size of the confusion noise present in our maps by finding the relative contributions of the noise and signal variances . the sample ( per pixel )",
    "variance of the optimally filtered lockman map in the good coverage region is found to be 2.37  mjy@xmath0 .",
    "the variance of the optimally filtered jackknife maps in the same region is 1.81  mjy@xmath0 , leaving 0.56  mjy@xmath0 due to sources .",
    "the variance contributed by all the sources in table [ table : sourcelist ] is approximately 0.33  mjy@xmath0 , of which 0.10  mjy@xmath0 is expected to be due to false detections of random noise peaks .",
    "this leaves 0.33  mjy@xmath0 due to undetected sources .",
    "this represents an s / n per pixel of 0.37 in rms units ; considered in quadrature with the 1.81  mjy@xmath0 of the noise , it increases the noise estimates and the rms of the bias function by about 9% . to estimate the effect of confusion noise on the survey completeness and bias , particularly in the tail ,",
    "sources were injected one at a time into the real map and extracted using the source extraction algorithm , with the completeness and bias calculated as in the noise - only case .",
    "this has the effect of making only a small change in the observed distribution of pixel values , effectively preserving that distribution .",
    "no effort was taken to avoid the positions of source candidates , as this would bias the procedure by failing to take into account the tail of the distribution .",
    "this test showed that the bias acquired a high flux density tail , as expected , and the completeness was increased above its gaussian noise value .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that this method provides an upper limit because it effectively `` double - counts '' confusion : the map into which the sources are injected is already confused .",
    "positions of high flux in the true map may already consist of two coincident lower flux sources , and so the probability of a third source lying on top of them is not truly as high as the probability we would calculate by this procedure .",
    "the determination of the completeness and bias in this way is also limited by the statistics of only having one realization of the confusion noise . applying these new bias and completeness functions , as well as the gaussian noise - only bias and completeness ( eqs.and [ [ eq : gaussianbias ] ] ) , to a power - law model of the number counts ( the best - fit model of  [ subsection : modeldnc ] ) ,",
    "the change in the observed counts is of order the size of the 68% confidence interval for poisson errors in the observed counts .",
    "thus , confusion noise is not wholly negligible nor does it dominate . in extracting the number counts , we ignore the confusion noise but discuss how to treat it correctly in ",
    "[ subsec : syseffectsnumcounts ] .",
    "to extract number counts from this data set , we use equation ( [ eq : finaldnc ] ) with the simulation - derived false detections and the completeness and bias of equations ( [ eq : gaussiancompleteness ] ) and ( [ eq : gaussianbias ] ) . a model for @xmath100",
    "is also required . because of the small number of detections , the model must have as few free parameters as possible so that the data will be able to constrain the model parameters .",
    "this pushes us away from detailed , physically motivated models and toward a simple model in combination with several , somewhat arbitrary , constraints .",
    "we use a two - parameter power - law model for @xmath100 given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 $ ] and @xmath149 is a fixed constant ( not a parameter of the model ) .",
    "the choice of this form for @xmath150 reduces the degeneracy between @xmath135 and @xmath151 that prevails over narrow ranges of @xmath102 , such as in this survey .",
    "we have set @xmath152  mjy .",
    "the unaltered model of equation ( [ eq : dnds_model ] ) is unsatisfactory at both high and low flux values . at low fluxes ,",
    "the model diverges , requiring a cutoff on which the result depends .",
    "the issue of the low - flux cutoff is discussed further in  [ subsec : syseffectsnumcounts ] . for",
    "now , we simply impose a low - flux cutoff @xmath153  mjy in the integral over @xmath102 in equation ( [ eq : finaldnc ] ) .",
    "in addition , if the model is extended indefinitely to high fluxes , it may produce too many sources to be consistent with the lack of observed sources .",
    "this constraint nevertheless does not determine the shape of number counts above the highest flux observed .",
    "thus , one must either implement a high - flux cutoff or assume something about the shape of the number counts beyond the region where they are measured . to address this ,",
    "a single bin of the same width as the other bins has been added to the data at high fluxes , where the data are zero and the model nonzero ; beyond @xmath154  mjy , the model is zero .",
    "fixing the upper cutoff as above and allowing the lower to float to its best - fit value produces @xmath155  mjy .",
    "two additional possibilities were also tried for a high - flux cutoff : ( 1 ) setting the model to zero beyond the highest filled bin resulted in a very shallow index ( @xmath156 ) , and ( 2 ) allowing the highest bin to extend to infinity produced a very steep power law ( @xmath157 ) . while both of these cases are unphysical , they illustrate the sensitivity of the power - law model on the high - flux cutoff .",
    "thus , the constraints that have been adopted , while arbitrary , serve to restrict the range of possible models sufficiently to extract reasonable values of @xmath158 $ ] . however , in light of this arbitrariness , the resulting constraint on the parameters of the power - law model must be treated with skepticism .    to fit to the model",
    ", the data are first binned .",
    "the number of sources with observed flux between @xmath159 and @xmath160 is denoted by @xmath161 .",
    "we assume that the number of sources counted in any interval @xmath162 follows an approximate poisson process and therefore that each @xmath161 is a poisson - distributed random variable that is independent of @xmath163 for @xmath164 .",
    "the same would not be true of the cumulative counts , and so the differential counts are preferred for this analysis .",

    "the value of the model in a given observed bin is defined as @xmath168 the function @xmath169 is minimized with respect to @xmath170 to find the maximum likelihood value of @xmath170 .",
    "two modifications of the likelihood equation ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) were made for this analysis .",
    "the first is that a prior was applied to constrain @xmath171 , so that both the integral of the number counts and the integral of the total flux density remained finite for @xmath172 .",
    "thus , @xmath173 second , to extract confidence regions for the fitted parameters , it was necessary to normalize @xmath174 , such that @xmath175 this normalization was done by numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its integral over the region where it is appreciably nonzero ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : likelihood ] below ) .",
    "the various components of this fit are shown in figure [ fig : fit_results ] .",
    "the data are shown with 68% confidence interval error bars , based on the observed number of sources in each bin , scaled to an area of a square degree .",
    "the error bars were computed according to the prescription of @xcite for small number poisson statistics ( which unifies the treatment of upper confidence limits and two - sided confidence intervals ) .",
    "the error bar on the highest flux density bin is an upper limit .",
    "the model is clearly consistent with the data given the error bars .",
    "( all six model bins falling within the 68% confidence interval error bars of the data _ may _ imply that the errors have been overestimated , although this has a 10% probability of occurring . )",
    "examining the fit in stages , one finds that the product of the survey completeness and the best - fit number counts shows that the survey incompleteness reduces the number of sources observed at low flux densities as expected ; above @xmath177 mjy , the survey is essentially complete .",
    "the effect of the bias , however , combined with the steepness of the number counts , increases the number of sources observed in all bins substantially above that of the underlying source distribution and contributes to the observed number of sources in all bins .",
    "in fact , based on the best - fit dnc and computing over the range of fluxes observed , 67% of real sources will have a true flux density _ below _ the detection threshold .",
    "note that the best - fit number counts lie below the poisson errors for the raw counts , demonstrating again that the survey bias is a nonnegligible effect .",
    "given the maximum likelihood values of @xmath135 and @xmath151 ( 52.0 and 3.16 , respectively ) , the cumulative source count at @xmath176 mjy is 192@xmath177 deg@xmath178 .",
    "this is consistent with the 1.2 mm mambo number count result ( 378@xmath179 deg@xmath178 ) for the combined lockman hole and european large - area iso survey ( elais ) n2 regions ( greve at al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "contours of the likelihood function for this fit are shown in figure [ fig : likelihood ] . in calculating the likelihood",
    ", the upper and lower flux limits were assumed to be a correct model , and as such , the likelihood does not account for violations of this assumption .",
    "the shaded region was obtained by integrating the normalized likelihood @xmath174 for values @xmath180 , such that the integral was equal to 0.68 .",
    "these are bayesian errors that incorporate the prior belief that @xmath171 .      as the above discussion indicates , the extraction of number counts from this data set is subject to a number of difficulties and caveats .",
    "in addition to the small - number statistics and the difficulty in modeling the dependence of the survey bias and completeness on the confusion noise that have already been discussed , a separate discussion of the principal limitations of the preceding analysis is in order .",
    "these are the low s / n of the detections and the sensitivity of the result to the lowest flux objects assumed to contribute to the observed counts .",
    "these limitations may be overcome with a more sophisticated future analysis , as we discuss .",
    "the survey bias , combined with an underlying number counts distribution rising at low fluxes , has a strong effect on the fluxes of sources observed at low s / n .",
    "this problem is exacerbated in the presence of confusion noise , but it is present in surveys in which random noise dominates over the confusion noise as well .",
    "this point has been appreciated in the historical confusion literature .",
    "@xcite showed how to use a maximum likelihood method to extract a power - law slope from observed flux densities , and @xcite extended this to the case of sources observed with gaussian noise .",
    "because of the divergence at low fluxes of a power law , a lower limit in flux must be imposed in order to obtain finite answers .",
    "the principal conclusion of @xcite was that the power - law slope of the number counts determined by the maximum likelihood method depends sensitively on this lower cutoff if the s / n of the sources used in the survey is less than 5 , whereas above this point the slope determination , while biased , is not dependent on the lower cutoff .",
    "this sensitivity to the lower flux cutoff also applies to the amplitude of the power law as well , a point that is clearly described by @xcite .",
    "although the @xcite result is for the rather unphysical case of a power law with an abrupt cutoff , the general result that derived number counts based on low - s / n sources will depend sensitively on the assumed behavior of the underlying number counts far below threshold is more general .",
    "this may be seen by considering the behavior of @xmath181 as @xmath182 . as long as this function is increasing",
    ", the bias will continue to push some sources of low intrinsic flux up above the detection threshold , and so the low - s / n regime will contain sources from well below threshold . [ note that this is consistent with the behavior of @xmath183 , since for @xmath103 greater than threshold , @xmath109 is positive for all values of @xmath102 . ]",
    "one can see from figure [ fig : completeness ] that the completeness drops off rather slowly for gaussian noise ( and even more slowly when confusion noise is added ) and never vanishes .",
    "in fact , the product of the gaussian completeness times any @xmath184 , @xmath185 , diverges as @xmath182 , so for many otherwise reasonable number counts models , this problem will occur .",
    "thus , in the presence of any sort of bias , whether due to confusion or noise , deriving accurate counts above threshold requires a nontrivial amount of information about the counts well below threshold if the s / n of the detections is low .",
    "since all of our sources have s / n  @xmath186  5 , any constraint placed on the power - law amplitude and slope will likely depend sensitively on the lower cutoff chosen .",
    "an analysis technique that overcomes all of the shortcomings mentioned above is the so - called fluctuation or `` @xmath187 '' analysis @xcite .",
    "this analysis matches the shape of the observed pixel value distribution ( fig.[fig : histogram ] ) against the prediction for a model distribution combined with the instrument noise .",
    "it overcomes the small - number statistics by using the full map instead of only the above - threshold detections .",
    "it addresses the nonlinear aspects of equation ( [ eq : finaldnc ] ) by directly including the confusion noise . low",
    "s / n is no longer an issue , since individual sources are no longer considered , and the lowest flux considered is naturally at the confusion limit where additional sources contribute only a mean to the observed histogram .",
    "the unchopped scan strategy of the lockman hole data simplifies such an analysis because of the simplicity of the effective beam .",
    "additional effects such as the attenuation of large angular scale structure by the atmospheric cleaning or the angular correlation of sources may also be straightforwardly included .",

    "a number of other groups have previously published number counts of submillimeter galaxies .",

    "these include surveys of blank - fields by scuba on the jcmt at 850  @xmath3 m @xcite , observations of galaxies lensed by clusters , also using scuba at 850  @xmath3 m @xcite , and blank - field surveys by mambo on the iram telescope @xcite .",
    "the bolocam result is plotted as the maximum likelihood cumulative number counts ( computed from the dnc described in ",
    "[ subsection : modeldnc ] ) , evaluated from 1 mjy to the maximum observed flux density ( 6.8 mjy ) .",
    "the number counts in the figure are not adjusted for the wavelength differences of the surveys .",
    "the bolocam result is in broad agreement with previous measurements ; the maximum likelihood cumulative number counts are consistent with the 1200 @xmath3 m measurement and below the 850 @xmath3 m measurements , as expected if the same population of objects is being measured .",
    "the region of 68% probability in parameter space has been translated to cumulative number counts and is shown by the region between the dashed curves .",
    "this region does not correspond to the naive expectation of poisson errors based on the number of detected sources .",
    "this is due to both the strong effect of the bias and the flux cutoffs imposed on the model .",
    "because of the bias , it is inappropriate to assume that the number of observed sources in a bin can be used as a measure of the uncertainty in the underlying number counts in that bin .",
    "the effect of assuming an upper flux cutoff is particularly evident in the figure in the rapid drop of the cumulative counts as the cutoff is approached .",
    "this causes the error bars to be artificially small , as any model is constrained to be zero beyond this point .",
    "the maximum likelihood number count model presented here , as well as its errors , depends strongly on the exact low- and high - flux cutoffs assumed for the underlying distribution and consequently can not be treated as definitive .",
    "in addition to the caveats above , it should be borne in mind that the uncertainty of the flux bias discussed in  [ subsection : calibration ] ( derived from the rms pointing error between the bolocam galaxy candidates and coincident radio sources ) introduces a systematic shift in the simple model of equation ( [ eq : dnds_model ] ) : the parameter @xmath135 changes by an amount @xmath188 .",
    "this gives a steep dependence of the amplitude of the number counts on the calibration error and the presumed power - law index .    at high flux densities , where the survey is nearly complete and the effect of",
    "the bias is smallest , model - independent constraints may be obtained . in particular , the lack of any observed sources with flux density greater than 8 mjy has been used to place a 90% upper confidence limit on the cumulative number counts above 8 mjy ; this is shown by the dashed horizontal line in the figure .",
    "this constraint depends only linearly on the calibration error .",
    "bolocam appears to be measuring near the region where the number counts , based on both the 850 and 1200 @xmath189 measurements , would be expected to turn over , but because of the limited survey area , we do not strongly constrain the number counts at the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "the fraction of the firas integrated far - infrared background light @xcite measured by this survey can be computed in several ways . summing the flux densities of all observed sources",

    "the bolocam survey encompasses the entire 850 @xmath3 m 8 mjy jcmt scuba and 1.2 mm iram mambo surveys to a comparable depth under the assumption of a model sed for a galaxy at @xmath88 , with relative rms of 1:0.9:0.6@xmath161.4 , respectively .",
    "we have reduced the resulting data set using a custom idl - based software pipeline , in which correlated atmospheric and instrument noise is rigorously removed via a pca sky subtraction technique .",
    "we detect 17 galaxies at a significance of @xmath55 , where the map rms is @xmath171.4 mjy .",
    "a series of simulations have allowed us to verify the robustness of the galaxy candidates .",
    "extensive jackknife and pointing jitter tests reveal that the sources detected in this survey have a small characteristic length scale ( point sources ) and are contributed to by the ensemble of observations , strongly indicating that the galaxy candidates are real .",
    "simulations of the observations using both synthetic maps and observational data indicate that six false detections should be expected .",
    "comparing our detections to those of other surveys ( including scuba 850 @xmath3 m , mambo 1.2 mm , and vla radio observations ) indicates that the majority of bolocam sources have coincident detections in at least two other wavebands ; we conclude that a majority of the bolocam detections are real .",
    "six of the detections are galaxies previously detected by the scuba 8 mjy survey . of the remaining 11 bolocam detections ,",
    "9 of them lie outside the scuba survey region , and we can not search for counterparts for them .",
    "seven of the 17 bolocam detections have been detected by the mambo 1.2 mm survey , with 6 of the remaining 10 sources lying outside the mambo good coverage region .",
    "while both the scuba and mambo surveys detect most of the bolocam sources in the overlap region , neither bolocam nor scuba / mambo detect the majority of the remaining scuba and mambo sources .",
    "a total of 65% of the 17 bolocam source candidates have at least one radio coincidence , although the accidental radio detection rate is high ( 34% ) owing to the size ( 31  fwhm ) of the bolocam beam .",
    "furthermore , we statistically detect the aggregate average of the scuba and mambo sources below our 3 @xmath50 detection threshold at significances of 3.3 and 4.0 @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "further simulations enabled us to estimate the completeness and bias of this survey , which were subsequently used with the false detection rate to fit a simple power - law model of the underlying parent distribution to match the observed number count distribution .",
    "this model constrains the submillimeter counts over the flux density range @xmath237 = 1@xmath167 mjy .",
    "while the validity of this model is significantly limited by both the effects of confusion noise and the flux density cutoffs assumed for the underlying number count distribution , we find this modeled number count distribution to be consistent with previously published submillimeter galaxy number counts .",
    "integrating the maximum likelihood differential number counts distribution between 1 and 6.8 mjy ( the maximum observed flux density ) yields 276 mjy in the map , or @xmath1713% of the firas integrated far - infrared background light .",
    "if the bolocam galaxy candidates lie at redshifts @xmath238 , then their inferred luminosities are @xmath239 @xmath6 ( assuming a dust temperature of 40 k ) . further assuming that they are powered by star formation",
    ", large sfrs of @xmath226 @xmath8 are implied .",
    "multiwavelength follow - up observations of the lockman hole field are underway with _ spitzer _ and sharc - ii in order to constrain the temperature / redshift distributions of these sources .    with alacrity , we acknowledge the support of the cso director and staff , the support of kathy deniston , and helpful conversations with andrew blain , steven eales , and min yun . this work was supported in part by nsf grants ast-0098737 , ast-9980846 , and ast-0206158 and pparc grants ppa / y / s/2000/00101 and ppa / g / o/2002/00015 .",
