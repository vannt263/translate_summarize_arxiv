    "the study of @xmath0 meson weak decays is of high interest in heavy flavor physics and cp violation . in particular ,",
    "much attention has been paid to the two - body charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays , but there are relatively less discussions on the decays with charmful mesons , such as the modes with two charmed - meson in which the final states are both heavy .",
    "however , the two charmed - meson decays can provide some valuable and unique information which is different from the light meson productions .",
    "for example , cp asymmetries in the decays of @xmath3 play important roles in testing the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) as well as exploring new physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , these decays are ideal modes to check the factorization hypothesis as the phenomenon of color transparency for the light energetic hadron is not applicable . since the decay branching ratios ( brs ) , cp asymmetries ( cpas ) and polarizations of @xmath4 have been partially observed in experiments @xcite , it is timely to examine these heavy - heavy @xmath0 decays in more detail .    at the quark level ,",
    "one concludes that the two charmed - meson decays are dominated by tree contributions since the corresponding inclusive modes are @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that the factorization has been tested to be successful in the usual color - allowed processes . however , the mechanism of factorization in heavy - heavy decays is not the same as the case of the light hadron productions .",
    "the color transparency argument @xcite for light energetic hadrons is no longer valid to the modes with heavy - heavy final states .",
    "the reason can be given as follows .",
    "due to the intrinsic soft dynamics in the charmed - meson , non - vanishing soft gluon contributions are involved in the strong interactions between an emission heavy meson with the remained @xmath8 system . since the corresponding divergences may not be absorbed in the definition of the hadronic form factor or hadron wave function , the decoupling of soft divergences is broken .",
    "this means that the mechanism of factorization has to be beyond the perturbative frameworks , such as qcd factorization @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath1 limit is another mechanism to justify factorization @xcite , corresponding to the effective color number @xmath9 in the naive factorization approach @xcite .",
    "the understanding of factorization in heavy - heavy decays requires some quantitative knowledge of non - perturbative physics which is not under control in theory . in this paper",
    ", we will assume the factorization hypothesis and apply the generalized factorization approach ( gfa ) @xcite to calculate the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "it is known that annihilation contributions and nonfactorizable effects with final state interactions ( fsis ) play important role during the light meson production in @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "for instance , to get large strong phases for cp asymmetries ( cpas ) in @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays , these effects are included inevitably @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are also crucial to explain the anomaly of the polarizations in @xmath12 decays , measured by babar @xcite and belle @xcite recently . by the naive analysis in flavor diagrams",
    ", one can easily see that the decay modes of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are annihilation - dominated processes .",
    "therefore , measurements of these decays will clearly tell us the importance of annihilation contributions in the production of two charmed - meson modes .    for the color - allowed decays , since the short - distant ( sd )",
    "nonfactorizable parts are associated with the wilson coefficient ( wc ) of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is induced by the gluon - loop and it is much smaller than @xmath17 , we can see that the effects arising from the sd non - spectator contributions should be small @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , long - distant ( ld ) nonfactorizable contributions governed by rescattering effects or fsis may not be negligible .",
    "inspired by the anomaly of the large transverse perpendicular polarization , denoted by @xmath18 , in @xmath12 decays , if there exist significant ld effects , we believe that large values of @xmath18 may appear in @xmath19 and @xmath20 too .",
    "as we will discuss , the power - law in the two - vector charmed - meson decay leads to a small @xmath18 .",
    "the recent measurement of the polarization fraction by the belle collaboration gives @xmath21 @xcite in which the central value is about a factor of three comparing with the model - independent prediction within the factorization approach and heavy quark symmetry .",
    "clearly , to get the implication from the data , we need a detailed analysis in two charmful final states of @xmath0 decays .",
    "to estimate the relevant hadronic effects for two - body decays in the @xmath0 system , we use the gfa , in which the leading effects are factorized parts , while the nonfactorized effects are lumped and characterized by the effective number of colors , denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "note that the scale and scheme dependences in effective wcs @xmath23 are insensitive . in the framework of the gfa , since the formulas for decay amplitudes are associated with the transition form factors , we consider them based on heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "we will also study their @xmath24 @xcite and power corrections which break heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we will try to find out the relationship between the hqs and its breaking effects for @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we will reexamine the influence of penguin effects , neglected in the literature @xcite .",
    "we will show that sizable cpas in @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays may rely on fsis .",

    "interestingly , for the @xmath251 decay , the estimated result is close to the upper limit of @xmath246 observed by babar @xcite but close to the lower limit of @xmath21 observed by belle @xcite .",
    "we note that our results are different from the pqcd predictions in which @xmath252 @xcite . from our results",
    ", we can conjecture that if large @xmath18 , say around @xmath253 , is observed , large contributions should arise from fsis .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of b decaying into two charmed - mesons in the generalized factorization approach .",
    "the penguin contributions have also been taken into account . if the final states are both pseudoscalar mesons , the ratio of penguin and tree contributions is about 10% in the decay amplitude .",
    "the direct cp violating asymmetries have been estimated to be a few percent . for",
    "the @xmath254 decays , the  penguin pollution \" is weaker than that in the @xmath255 mode .",
    "thus , these modes provide cleaner places to cross - check the value of @xmath256 measured in the @xmath257 decays .",

    "the predictions of branching ratios in theory are consistent with the experimental data within the present level .",
    "the variations of branching ratios with the effective color number @xmath182 show that the soft fsis are not dominant .",
    "however , we can not make the conclusion that they are negligible .",
    "their effects can be of order 10 - 20% for branching ratios as indicated from the variation of @xmath182 .",
    "since the soft divergences are not canceled in the non - factorizable corrections , this may indicate that the strong interactions at low energy either become weak or are suppressed by some unknown parameters ( such as @xmath1 in the large @xmath1 theory ) .",
    "if the factorization is still a working concept in the heavy - heavy decays , there must be some non - perturbative mechanisms which prefer the factorization of a large - size charmed - meson from an environment of `` soft cloud '' .",
    "a relevant comment on the necessity of non - perturbative qcd justification can be found in @xcite .",
    "the polarization structure in the heavy - heavy decays has shown that the transverse perpendicular polarization fraction @xmath18 is the smallest while the other two are comparable in size .",
    "this structure follows from the qcd dynamics in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we have found one relation between the transverse perpendicular polarization fraction and the ratios of form factors , in particular @xmath260 .",
    "the corrections to the heavy quark limit give an enhancement of @xmath18 from 0.055 to about 0.09 .",
    "since the fsis are not significant , we do not expect that fsis can change our prediction of @xmath18 substantially .",
    "if future measurements confirm @xmath261 as the recent measurement by belle , it will be difficult to explain within the hqet and the factorization hypothesis .    in conclusion",

    "more precise experimental data are desired to give a better justification . for theory , to explain the mechanism of factorization in the heavy - heavy decays is of high interest .",
