    "the solar wind is a turbulent plasma @xcite , mainly composed by protons and electrons , which can be considered collisionless in good approximation . because of the turbulent character of the interplanetary medium , the energy injected into it at large scales as alfvnic fluctuations is transferred towards short scales along the turbulent spectrum . in such a collisionless medium , what physical mechanism drives the short - scale dissipation of the energy injected at large scales still remains an unanswered question and attracts nowadays a significant scientific interest .",
    "in fact , the identification of the fluctuations responsible for channeling the energy toward short wavelengths and the full understanding of the dissipation mechanisms in the solar wind represent two top priority subjects in space plasma physics .",
    "the power spectrum of the solar - wind fluctuating fields in the range of long wavelengths manifests a behavior reminiscent of the @xmath2 kolmogorov power law for fluids @xcite , @xmath3 being the wavenumber .",
    "the kolmogorov - like spectral behavior extends down to a range of wavelengths close to typical proton kinetic scales ( the proton inertial length @xmath0 , and/or the proton larmor radius ) . here ,",
    "the features of the spectra abruptly change with the appearance of a spectral break @xcite and kinetic effects presumably govern the system dynamics .    in these range of scales and even down to typical electron kinetic scales , many solar - wind observational analyses @xcite , theoretical works @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite suggest that the so - called kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) can play an important role in the mechanism of turbulent energy dissipation and heating .",
    "kaws are alfvn cyclotron waves propagating almost perpendicularly to the background magnetic field",
    ". an extensive linear analysis of these waves has been performed by hollweg in 1999 @xcite ( see also references therein for a more complete view on the subject ) . the fact that these fluctuations can be important in the development of the solar - wind turbulent cascade",
    "is supported by observational data which show that the distribution of wavevectors of long wavelength magnetic fluctuations has a significant population quasi - perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the hybrid vlasov - maxwell ( hvm ) code @xcite , to study numerically the characteristics of the kaws in linear and nonlinear regime , in the range of spatial scales close to proton skin depth .",
    "the hvm algorithm integrates numerically the vlasov equation for the proton distribution function in multi - dimensional phase space . in the present work ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to the 1d-3v ( one dimension in physical space and three dimensions in velocity space ) phase space configuration . within the hvm model",
    "the electrons are considered as a fluid and a generalized ohm equation is employed for computing the electric field , which retains the hall term and the electron inertia effects .",
    "quasi neutrality is assumed and the displacement current is neglected in the ampere equation , making the assumption of low frequency dynamics .",
    "finally , an isothermal equation of state for the scalar electron pressure is employed to close the hvm system ( for more details on the hvm equations and on the numerical algorithm see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the hvm code is a well - tested algorithm which has been successfully employed for numerical studies of plasma turbulence @xcite and ion - cyclotron heating @xcite .",
    "we present the results of a series of linear and nonlinear simulations , in a situation of single - wave propagation , with a single wavenumber slightly larger than the proton skin depth wavenumber .",
    "our goal is to perform a detailed analysis of the process of wave - particle interaction , in linear and nonlinear regime , involving resonant protons and kaws , in typical conditions of the solar wind environment and in a range of spatial scales close to @xmath0 . as discussed in detail in the following ,",
    "our numerical results show that the efficient resonant interaction between the kaws and the protons can significantly shape the particle distribution function , making the plasma depart from the maxwellian configuration of thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the dispersion relation of the kaw and corresponding eigenmodes for magnetic and velocity perturbations are derived in the framework of linear two - fluid theory , under the assumptions of quasi - neutrality and negligible displacement current .",
    "section iii is devoted to the description of the hybrid vlasov - maxwell simulations and of the numerical results for the propagation of the kaws , both in linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section iv .",
    "in this section , we revisit the two - fluid approach to derive the dispersion relation and the eigenmodes of the kaws in linear approximation . to make contact with the hvm model ,",
    "the set of linear two - fluid ( protons and electrons ) equations have been solved under the assumption of quasi - neutrality ( @xmath4 ) and by neglecting the displacement current in the ampere equation .",
    "moreover , proton and electron scalar pressures have been assigned a general adiabatic equation of state .",
    "this analysis allows us to specialize to the hybrid case the linear expectations for the wave frequency of kaws obtained in previous works ( see , for instance , ref .",

    "<S> kinetic alfvn waves represent an important subject in space plasma physics , since they are thought to play a crucial role in the development of the turbulent energy cascade in the solar wind plasma at short wavelengths ( of the order of the proton inertial length @xmath0 and beyond ) </S>",
    "<S> . a full understanding of the physical mechanisms which govern the kinetic plasma dynamics at these scales can provide important clues on the problem of the turbulent dissipation and heating in collisionless systems . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> hybrid vlasov - maxwell simulations are employed to analyze in detail the features of the kinetic alfvn waves at proton kinetic scales , in typical conditions of the solar wind environment . in particular , linear and nonlinear regimes of propagation of these fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> have been investigated in a single - wave situation , focusing on the physical processes of collisionless landau damping and wave - particle resonant interaction . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , since for wavelengths close to @xmath0 and proton plasma beta @xmath1 of order unity the kinetic alfvn waves have small phase speed compared to the proton thermal velocity , wave - particle interaction processes produce significant deformations in the core of the particle velocity distribution , appearing as phase space vortices and resulting in flat - top velocity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as the eulerian hybrid vlasov - maxwell algorithm allows for a clean almost noise - free description of the velocity space , three - dimensional plots of the proton velocity distribution help to emphasize how the plasma departs from the maxwellian configuration of thermodynamic equilibrium due to nonlinear kinetic effects .    </S>"
