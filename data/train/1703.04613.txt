    "superconducting qubits are promising components for the construction of practical quantum computers .",
    "a persistent challenge is two - qubit gate errors , in particular for multi - qubit entangling operations .",
    "it is desirable to have long coherence times and fast , accurate controls .",
    "however , achieving both objectives at once has been difficult for superconducting qubits .",
    "some architectures rely on fixed - frequency qubits with static qubit - qubit coupling . while such systems exhibit long coherence times approaching @xmath0 , two - qubit gates are typically hundred - nanoseconds in duration , limiting fidelities so far to @xmath1  @xcite .",
