    "the observation of 2-solar mass neutron stars@xcite seems to indicate that the equation of state(eos ) for compact stars needs to be sufficiently stiffer to accommodate the mass larger than 1.5-solar mass .",
    "moreover it requires the detailed information on the hadronic matter at higher density than the normal nuclear density , @xmath2 , which seems to be however much higher beyond the reach of presently planned terrestrial laboratories .",
    "after the recent detections of gravitational waves from binary black holes@xcite , the expectation of detecting gravitational waves from a binary neutron stars and/or a black hole - neutron star binary becomes very optimistic than ever .",
    "the gravitational waves emitted during the binary inspiral phase up to merging can provide us the information on the dense hadronic matter of higher density at the core of compact stars .",
    "the nuclei with large atomic numbers are already obvious examples of highly dense matters composed of nucleons , @xmath3 .",
    "the effective theories of nucleons have been developed and constrained by experimental data available up to and slightly above the normal nuclear density , @xmath2 .",
    "hence they are fairly well controlled theoretically and experimentally .",
    "but the high density regime much above @xmath2 is more or less uncharted both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "compact objects such as neutron stars are supposed to have higher core density than the normal nuclear density , @xmath2 .",
    "roughly for neutron star with mass @xmath4 the relevant density at the center is likely around @xmath5 and for the mass @xmath6 the density is supposed to be larger than @xmath7 . on top of the possibilities of getting high density nuclear matter at terrestrial laboratories , for example frib(usa ) , fair(germany ) , j - parc(japan ) and raon(korea ) in near future , the possible detections of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars(or binary neutron star black hole ) are believed to be promising probes of the high density interior of neutron stars .",
    "theoretically the success of low density effective theories univocally up to the normal nuclear density seems not to guarantee the similar success at higher density hadronic matter since the predictions of mass , radius , symmetry energy and deformability to name a few diverse from each other drastically beyond the normal nuclear density . in this sense",
    "we are now at the very exciting period of foreseeing the opportunity of constraining theories at higher density by experiments and observations .    for the highly dense hadronic matter , recently we proposed a new approach@xcite in which we try to formulate a field theory framework wherein both low and high density regimes are treated on the same footing . to cover both regimes in a consistent way in a unified field theoretic",
    "approach seems like a tall order . in this work",
    ", we discuss the physical properties of stellar matter using the newly proposed scheme of a new scaling law(blpr ) in medium@xcite all the way from normal nuclear density up to the higher density at the core of a neutron star . with a confrontation with the observed massive stars@xcite",
    ", we discuss the physical properties of stellar matter with the eos obtained therein .",
    "the relevant quantities are mass , radius and deformability parameters , which could be constrained by the gravitational wave forms emitted during the binary inspiraling phase .",
    "the aim here is then to confirm or falsify the strategies taken and assumptions made in dong _",
    "et al._@xcite and lee _",
    "et al._@xcite and also to find the directions to be taken in constructing the correct effective theory at higher density .    in section",

    "tidal deformation with new stiffer eos is discussed with the observational possibility in gravitational wave detections at aligo@xcite and avirgo@xcite in section iv .",
    "the results are summarized in section v. we use units in which @xmath8 and the notation in which minkowski metric @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the unified field theoretic approach is formulated using an effective theory which has sufficient number of degrees of freedom and parameters to be able to implement desired symmetries in high density regime or at the critical density , @xmath10 .",
    "the first step is to construct the functional forms of parameters of the effective theory in terms of the variables in qcd , for example , quark and gluon condensates . by matching procedures near at qcd scale .",
    "then , if we can compute the density dependence of qcd condensates , they automatically determine the density dependence of parameters in the effective theory .",
    "in addition the vacuum can be characterized by the expectation value of the relevant field , in this work scalar field @xmath11 , which is supposed to depend on the density .",
    "these are the intrinsic density dependencies(idd ) inherited from the quark / gluon condensates and scalar condensate . at low density ( up to nuclear matter density ) the success of chiral perturbation theory(chpt ) and",
    "low energy theorems implies that the qcd matching is implicitly taken care already .",
    "but at higher density , qcd matching or idd will play a very crucial role since the naive extrapolation of chpt , in which the qcd matching is implicit and therefore hidden , may go anywhere if not guided by the explicit qcd matching constraints .",
    "the first step forward to that goal has been made using the effective lagrangian with minimum number of degree of freedom , which are the pseudo scalar mesons @xmath12 , and scalar meson @xmath13 , vector mesons @xmath14 and nucleon @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt the relativistic mean field(rmf ) approach , which are found to work remarkably well for finite and nuclear matter as well as for highly dense matter inside compact stars .",
    "the success of rmf can be understood that rmf captures the physics of the landau fermi liquid fixed point at which nuclear matter is located .",
    "it is assumed that the symmetries hidden at lower density on top of underlying chiral symmetry are the hidden local symmetry and the scale symmetry , which are supposed to be manifested explicitly eventually at the critical density higher than normal nuclear density .",
    "the details are reviewed in recent articles @xcite .",

    "new br / blpr scaling has been proposed@xcite to incorporate the change in topology of the crystal structure of skyrmions , skyrmion @xmath18 half - skyrmion@xcite .",
    "suppose the threshold density , @xmath19 , is higher but not so higher than the normal nuclear density , @xmath2 , then we expect the physical effect of such topology change on nuclear matter at the density @xmath20 .",
    "more elaborated effective lagrangian including @xmath21-meson has been discussed by paeng _",
    "et al._@xcite but in this work we use the simpler version discussed by dong _",
    ".    the drastic change in the symmetry energy observed at the density @xmath19 @xcite can be translated into the parameter changes of the lagrangian , a new scaling . with new scaling , new - br / blpr scaling",

    "the new scaling is incorporated into the @xmath22 - implemented eft approach to calculate the equation of state and the mass - radius relation of a compact object of a pure neutron matter .",
    "the stiffer equation of state has been obtained as expected and the mass can be as large as @xmath23@xcite , which seems to be consistent with recently observed high mass neutron stars . in this work",

    "recently the tidally modified waveforms have been developed up to the high frequency of merger@xcite , such that the deformability parameter @xmath0 , a function of the neutron - star eos and mass , is measurable within the frequency range of the projected design sensitivity of aligo and avirgo .",

    "they also show that the neutron star radius can be measured to better than @xmath130 km .",
    "thus the simultaneous measurement of mass , radius and deformability using gravitational wave detectors could present an exciting possibility to eventually pin down the highly uncertain eos for the nuclear matter in the mass range of @xmath110@xmath103 .",
    "this would provide a probe for the state of baryonic matter at the high density that is theoretically the most uncertain . and the hope is whether one can confirm or falsify the strategies taken and assumptions made in @xcite and whether the result would then help point the directions to be taken in the efforts described in @xcite .    _ hyun kyu lee _ :  when gerry invited me to stony brook in 1998 for my sabbatical year , he put me in a house just next to his .",
