    "the strong fuv continua of planetary nebula central stars provide excellent backdrops for observing absorption lines produced by circumstellar material as well as foreground interstellar ( is ) clouds . the _ fuse _ band contains a uniquely broad suite of spectral features from different phases of material that may be present in the circumstellar environment , providing information on physical conditions along a path that traverses the entire multi - phase nebular envelope .",
    "an important consideration is the need to resolve circumstellar from is features , for species that may be present in both components .",
    "we preferentially selected targets with favorable velocities , such as bd+30@xmath13639 , in which nebular absorption is seen at @xmath2 @xmath3 70  km  s@xmath4 , blueshifted by @xmath355  km  s@xmath4 with respect to the is components ( dinerstein , sneden , & uglum 1995 ) .",
    "the primary motivation for our program was to search for the lyman and werner resonance lines that initiate the fluorescent excitation of h@xmath0 .",
    "this process is one of two chief mechanisms for exciting the near - infrared ( nir ) h@xmath0 quadrupole emission lines seen in many pne , the other being collisional excitation in shock - heated gas ( e.g.  black & van dishoeck 1987 ) .",
    "although initially the nir emission in pne was attributed to shocks , it has become clear that fluorescence plays an important role as well ( dinerstein et al .",
    "1988 ; hora , latter , & deutsch 1999 ) .",
    "_ fuse _ directly samples the pump lines from the @xmath5  =  0 levels of the ground state ( e.g. mccandliss 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , because of their large oscillator strengths , the fuv lines are sensitive to much smaller column densities of h@xmath0 than can be detected through nir emission .",
    ".results of _ fuse _ h@xmath0 search [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sample - table ]    table 1 summarizes the results for our program .",
    "although four of the targets are known sources of nir h@xmath0 emission , only one  bd+30@xmath13639  shows nebular h@xmath0 absorption .",
    "this object also shows excited h@xmath0 in its _",
    "uv spectrum , which contains hundreds of lines from @xmath5  @xmath6  2 in the ground electronic state ( dinerstein & bowers 2004 ; dinerstein et al , in preparation ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of bd+30@xmath13639 resembles that of m27 , the dumbbell nebula , which is rife with nebular h@xmath0 ( mccandliss et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "no nebular h@xmath0 is seen toward the central star of ngc  6720 , the ring nebula , where the nir h@xmath0 emission is clumpy and concentrated near the bright ring ( speck et al .",
    "2003 ) . the _ fuse _ results are consistent with the h@xmath0 residing in an equatorial torus , since the ring is seen pole - on , whereas the dumbbell is nearly equator - on .",
    "> from the _ fuse _ data , we set upper limits of @xmath7(h@xmath0 )  @xmath8  5  @xmath9  10@xmath10  @xmath11 for @xmath12  =  2  5 on the circumstellar components for three pne with nir h@xmath0 emission : ngc  40 , ngc  6720 , and swst  1 . these values are @xmath3  50  times lower than the actual column densities in bd+30@xmath13639 , and also than the beam - averaged values of @xmath13(h@xmath0 ) from the nir emission _ in the same pne . _",
    "we conclude that the h@xmath0 in these pne has a very non - uniform distribution , being either globally asymmetrical ( e.g. in a torus ) or concentrated in dense clumps . only in a few cases",
    "does the line of sight to the central star intercept circumstellar h@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath14 ground term of has two excited fine - structure levels that give rise to forbidden transitions at 63  @xmath15 and 145  @xmath15 . for @xmath16",
    "@xmath6  10@xmath17  @xmath18 , [ ] 63  @xmath15 is the strongest cooling line from pdrs , the transition regions between ionized and molecular material",
    ". ratios of the [ ] lines and [ ]  158  @xmath15 are diagnostics of physical conditions and pdr parameters ( kaufman et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the populations of the fine - structure levels can also be measured via uv absorption lines .",
    "the 13021306   triplet ( observable with _ hst _ ) is often saturated , and the line from the first excited level , 1304  , is blended with .",
    "the _ fuse _ band includes other , weaker transitions which can be used to derive the level populations .",
    "for example , the triplet near 1040    in swst  1 yields a value of @xmath19(**)/@xmath19 ( * ) which is twice the ratio of statistical weights .",
    "this is possible only if a non - collisional process dominates the excitation .",
    "based on the reported strengths of the optical lines ( de  marco et al .",
    "2001 ) , we identify this mechanism as fluorescent excitation by stellar continuum photons ( sterling et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in swst  1 the effect is obvious ; elsewhere , it could be more insidious , elevating the population of the @xmath17p@xmath20 level and strengthening [ ] 145  @xmath15 , thereby leading to an overestimate of the gas temperature .",
    "the uv spectral region also contains resonance lines from ions in the region .",
    "these can provide diagnostics of physical conditions and values for gas - phase abundances .",
    "we used _ fuse _ observations of uv lines from the ground and several excited fine - structure levels of , , and to derive the gas - phase fe / s ratio in swst  1 , for which we find an essentially solar value ( sterling et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this result suggests that fe is not depleted into dust along this particular path through the nebula , in marked contrast to the results found from the optical and nir emission lines , which indicate depletion factors of @xmath6  15 .",
    "the implied inhomogeneity in the dust - to - gas ratio echos the inhomogeneity seen in the h@xmath0 in this pn ( see  2 ) .",
    "_ fuse _ also offers access to some species that can not be observed in other spectral regions .",
    "for example , the neutron - capture element ge ( @xmath21  =  32 ) can be observed via the resonance line at 1088    ( sterling , dinerstein , & bowers 2002 ) .",
    "the ge abundance in pne can be enhanced by the dredge - up of _ s_-processed material during the agb phase .",
    "we find that ge / s is enriched by factors of three or more in a few pne observed by _",
    "we thank the operations and user - support staff of the _ fuse _ project for all their help in planning and executing this observing program .",
    "support for this research was provided by nasa goddard space flight center through data analysis grants nag  5 - 9239 , 5 - 11597 , and 5 - 12731 ."
