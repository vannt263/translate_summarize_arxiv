    "consider an incompressible isothermal and isotropic binary solution of constant molar volume which is initially homogeneous .",

    "the early stage of this process in which the solution is called spinodal decomposition . in order to descrive this phenomenon ,",
    "a well - known mathematical approach was introduced by j.w .",
    "cahn and j.e .",
    "hilliard ( see  @xcite ) who introduced an appropriate free energy functional .",
    "more precisely , given a bounded domain @xmath1 with @xmath2 occupied by a binary mixture of components a and b with a mass fraction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , setting @xmath5 , the free energy functional is given by @xmath6    the term @xmath7 is a surface tension term and @xmath8 is proportional to the thickness of the diffused interface .",
    "@xmath9 is a double well potential energy density which favors the separation of phases , that is , the formation of a - rich and b - rich regions .",
    "although the physically relevant potential @xmath9 is logarithmic ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 3.1 ) ) ) , in the literature it is usually approximated , for instance , by the following polynomial function @xmath10 once an energy is defined , the spinodal decomposition can be viewed as an energy minimizing process .",
    "thus , the evolution of the phenomenon can be described as a gradient flow ( cf .",
    "@xcite , see also  @xcite ) @xmath11 on a given time interval @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is called mobility and the chemical potential @xmath15 is the first variation of @xmath16 , that is , @xmath17 this is the well - known cahn - hilliard equation which has been widely studied by many authors .",
    "here we just mention some pioneering works @xcite for the case with constant mobility , while for nonconstant ( and degenerate at pure phases ) mobility the basic reference is  @xcite ( cf .",
    "also  @xcite for nondegenerate mobility ) . for further references",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .    however , the purely phenomenological derivation of the cahn - hilliard equation is somewhat unsatisfactory from the physical viewpoint .",
    "this led giacomin and lebowitz to study the problem of phase separation from the microscopic viewpoint using a statistical mechanics approach ( see  @xcite and also  @xcite ) . performing the hydrodynamic limit they deduced a continuum model which is a nonlocal version of the cahn - hilliard equation , namely , they found the following @xmath18 where @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a convolution kernel such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in this case , the free energy functional @xmath24 is given by @xmath25    it is worth observing that @xmath26 can be recovered from @xmath27 using taylor expansion for the term @xmath28 and supposing that @xmath29 is sufficiently peaked around zero .",
    "thus the original cahn - hilliard equation can be seen as an approximation of its local version .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in  @xcite , the corresponding sharp interface model is the same as the local cahn - hilliard equation .",
    "the nonlocal cahn - hilliard equation with degenerate mobility and logarithmic potential was first studied rigorously in @xcite .",
    "then more general results were proven in @xcite .",
    "the longtime behavior of single solutions was studied in @xcite , while the global longterm dynamics ( say , existence of global and exponential attractors ) was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the case of constant mobility and smooth potential was treated in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , some works have been devoted to study the nonlocal cahn - hilliard equation coupled with the navier - stokes system ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is a nonlocal variant of a well - known diffuse interface model for phase separation in two - phase incompressible and isothermal fluids ( model h ) .",
    "all such contributions produced , as by - products , further results on the nonlocal cahn - hilliard equation .    taking advantage of some of these results , here",
    "we want to introduce and study two nonlocal cahn - hilliard equations with reaction terms which have already been proposed and analyzed in the local case : the cahn - hilliard - oono ( cho ) equation and the cahn - hilliard - bertozzi - esedoglu - gillette ( chbeg ) equation ( see also @xcite for other types of reaction terms ) .",
    "let us introduce the former first .    in  @xcite",
    "the authors introduce a reaction between the molecules or the polymers in the mixture in order to stabilize and control the length of the patterns during spinodal decomposition .",
    "let us suppose that the mixture consists of molecules or polymers of type a and b and that a chemical reaction @xmath30{\\gamma_1 } b$ ] is induced during the spinodal decomposition . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the temperature dependent forward and backward reaction rates . by defining @xmath33 as the difference between the concentrations , the following cahn - hilliard type equation is proposed ( see  @xcite )",
    "@xmath34 this equation is known as the cho equation and was introduced in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite , however ) for phase separation in diblock copolymers ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it can be viewed as a gradient flow generated by the energy functional : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath8 are two positive constants and @xmath38 is the green function of @xmath39 with either periodic or no - flux boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath40 this energy differs from the one in just in the last term , which is nonlocal , and prefers rapid oscillations between the two polymers ( see  @xcite for the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "it has been observed that far from the domain border , pattern are not influenced by the boundary conditions .",
    "the most commonly used ones are either periodic or no - flux .",
    "the latter can be mathematically expressed as follows : @xmath41 if we integrate equation on the domain @xmath42 with such boundary condition we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 this equation is a linear ode with solution @xmath45 .",
    "note that , when @xmath46 , then @xmath47 implies the conservation of the total mass is conserved .",
    "this happens in phase separation of diblock copolymers . instead , if @xmath48 then @xmath49 converges to @xmath50 exponentially fast .",
    "more information and results about the cho equation and its application can be found in @xcite and references therein ( see also  @xcite for hydrodynamic effects ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the pattern formation process differs from the one associated with the classical cahn - hilliard equation ( see @xcite ) . as far as well - posedness and global longtime behavior ( i.e. , existence of global and exponential attractors )",
    "are concerned , we refer to  @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "the chbeg equation can be viewed as a generalized version of the cho equation .",
    "it has been introduced by bertozzi et al . to model image inpainting , i.e. , the restoration process of damaged images and _ super - resolution _",
    "( see  @xcite ) with regard to binary images or images with high contrast . as in the case of phase separation",
    ", the double well potential tends to separate the mixture in pure phases , so it does with binary images by separating the two colors of the image without many shades .",
    "the chbeg equation reads as follows @xmath51 here @xmath42 is a two - dimensional domain representing the whole image , with no - flux boundary conditions .",
    "the function @xmath9 is still a double well potential , with two minima @xmath52 and @xmath53 , that is , the two colors of the image .",
    "the function @xmath54 represents the image that needs to be restored ( @xmath55 where the color is @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the function @xmath58 is a penalization parameter which forces the restored image @xmath33 to be equal to @xmath54 outside the damaged region .",
    "the numerical simulations carried out in  @xcite show that the implemented method is faster then its main competitors and it gives satisfactory results .",
    "existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the cahn - hilliard equation for the chbeg equation have been proven in  @xcite , while the longtime behavior of its solutions has recently been analyzed in  @xcite .    on account of what we have observed concerning the derivation of the nonlocal cahn - hilliard equation",
    ", it seems natural to study the nonlocal variants of cho and chbeg equations .",
    "more precisely , we consider first a nonlocal cho equation with a transport term which accounts for a possible flow of the mixture at a certain given ( averaged ) velocity field @xmath59 , that is @xmath60 where @xmath19 is given by and @xmath61 is a given external source . here",
    "we have set all the constants equal to one but @xmath50 which has now been denoted by @xmath62 on account of .",
    "then , in the same spirit , we introduce the nonlocal version of the chbeg equation , that is , @xmath63 as for the cho equation , we include a transport term which can be used to improve the inpaint of the image and an external source . therefore we consider the following initial and boundary value problems @xmath64",

    "this will be done in sections [ eucho ] and [ euchbeg ] .",
    "then , in sections [ gacho ] and [ gachbeg ] , we will analyze nonlocal cho and chbeg equations equipped with no - flux boundary condition as dynamical systems on suitable phase spaces .",
    "in particular , we will prove the existence of a ( bounded ) absorbing set as well as of the global attractor .",
    "the former result will require some care ( especially for the chbeg equation ) to handle the bound on the spatial average of @xmath33 which is not conserved in general .",
    "we also expect to prove further results .",
    "for instance , the existence of more regular solutions , the regularization of weak solutions and the existence of exponential attractors as shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these issues will possibly be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "a more challenging question appears to be the following : does a solution converge to a single equilibrium ?",
    "this happens for the nonlocal cahn - hilliard equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , but it is open even for equation .",
    "we finally mention that further results on well - posedness and regularity in the case of degenerate mobility and logarithmic potential have recently been proven in @xcite . that work has been motivated by the present contribution .",
    "here we show that there exists a unique weak solution to problem under suitable assumptions on @xmath66 , @xmath61 , @xmath29 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also prove that any weak solution satisfies an energy equality and it depends continuously with respect to the initial datum in a suitable norm .",
    "we adapt the strategy used in  @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath67 will be denoted @xmath68 and the space @xmath69 will be denoted @xmath70 .",
