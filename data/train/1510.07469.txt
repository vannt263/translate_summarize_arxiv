    "it is one of the fundamental problems in nuclear physics to understand saturation properties of atomic nuclei on the basis of the underlying interactions between nucleons . a description of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction has been developed in about eighty years after the meson theory was conjectured by yukawa in 1935 @xcite .",
    "it was recognized in the early stage from the analyses of nn scattering data that the nn force described as an instantaneous two - nucleon potential is strongly repulsive at short distances as is fairly well approximated by a hard core .",
    "on the other hand , experimental evidences that disclose single - particle structures of atomic nuclei have been accumulated .",
    "an explanation of this seemingly contradicting situation was given by brueckner theory in the 1950 s @xcite .",
    "the central element in this theory is a reaction matrix ( or @xmath6 matrix ) , which describes in - medium nn correlation and takes care of strong repulsion of the nn interaction at short distances .",
    "afterwards , the theory was organized as the quantum many - body theory @xcite : the framework of a perturbation description of nuclei in terms of the @xmath6-matrices .",
    "although the brueckner theory was successful to qualitatively account for the reason for the appearance of the shell structure , a quantitative explanation of nuclear saturation properties has not been completed .",
    "various calculations in nuclear matter showed that theoretical saturation points obtained from existing nn potentials which achieve very high accuracy in describing scattering data miss the empirical location @xcite .",
    "it is improbable that a certain new functional form of the potential , either in coordinate space or in momentum space , resolves the problem . concerning higher - order correlations not included in these nuclear matter calculations ,",
    "their contributions have been shown to be rather modest and do not improve the situation @xcite .",
    "in addition , different quantum many - body frameworks , for example a variational method , also predict similar saturation properties to those in the brueckner theory @xcite .",
    "there have been various conjectures about the missing mechanism to explain the correct nuclear saturation properties , such as relativistic effects , many - body forces , and possible modifications of nucleon properties in the nuclear medium . among them , the three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) contribution is a promising candidate to be investigated first , for which the fujita - miyazawa @xcite type interaction involving an isobar @xmath7 excitation is a prototype . as for the relativistic effect ,",
    "dirac - bruckner calculations were shown to explain quantitatively nuclear matter saturation @xcite .",
    "however , the processes including anti - nucleon excitations involve considerably higher energy scale than that of the isobar @xmath7 excitation .",
    "thus , it is important to establish the contribution of the three - nucleon force effects to examine if it is reasonable or not .",
    "there have been many attempts in the literature to use the 3nf contributions to reproduce correct nuclear saturation properties @xcite . however , these calculations are exploratory or include more or less phenomenological adjustments .",
    "the situation has changed since the description of the nn interaction in chiral effective field theory ( ch - eft ) @xcite achieved , at the n@xmath4lo level , the comparable accuracy with other modern nn interactions below the pion production threshold energy and the 3nfs were introduced systematically and consistently to the nn sector .",
    "the study of ch - eft 3nf contributions in nuclear and neutron matter started in the many - body framework such as the hartree - fock approximation @xcite , and perturbation calculations up to the second order @xcite and the third order @xcite .",
    "the present author gave a brief report , in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the lowest - order brueckner theory ( lobt ) calculations in nuclear matter using the n@xmath4lo nn and nnlo 3nf interactions , in which a focus was put on the effective spin - orbit strength .",
    "the 3nf was treated as a density - dependent effective nn force , as in holt _",
    "@xcite but without introducing an approximation for off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "more details about the calculated saturation curves were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite presented results of similar lobt calculations .",
    "they also discuss cutoff scale dependence and order - by - order convergence of the ch - eft interactions on nuclear and neutron matter calculations @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have investigated the ch - eft 3nf contributions in their self - consistent green s function formalism , taking into account a correlated average of the 3nf over the third nucleon .",
    "all these calculations find the important and desirable effects of the 3nf to improve the description of nuclear saturation properties .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the saturation curve becomes close to the empirical one when the effects of the 3nf are included as an effective nn interaction by folding the third nucleon .",
    "in addition , the strong spin - orbit strength required for nuclear mean filed calculations is explained by the additional contribution from the 3nf @xcite .",
    "a further interesting observation is that the cutoff - energy dependence was substantially reduced by the inclusion of the 3nf effects , which is a desirable feature for the effective theory having a cutoff parameter .",
    "the mechanism to produce these results was briefly discussed in ref .",
    ". this paper supplements the explanation by extending the discussion to the wide scope of the nuclear saturation mechanism .    in fermion",
    "many - body calculations , a pauli exclusion plays essential roles in considering two - particle correlations . in a nucleon - nucleon correlation in the nuclear medium , the pauli effect reveals dominantly in the triplet even channel , because typical momentum transfer in the tensor correlation lies in the momentum region of the fermi momentum of nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "short - range repulsion is characterized by higher momentum transfer , and hence the short - range correlation is not sensitive to the pauli effect .",
    "the introduction of equivalent interactions in low - momentum space @xcite is concerned with the elimination of the short - range and thus high - momentum component of the nn interaction in the two - nucleon sector .",
    "it is useful to consider nuclear matter saturation curves obtained using low - momentum equivalent interaction .",
    "because the tensor interaction is also transformed to fit in the low - momentum space , the saturation curve varies with changing the low - momentum scale .",
    "this variation is due to the elimination of possible correlations in the many - body space , which should be recovered by inducing many - body effective interactions in the restricted space .",
    "this situation is shown to be analogous to the 3nf effects .",
    "section 2 revisits a coester band of lobt nuclear matter calculations , which was first demonstrated by coester _",
    "@xcite in 1970 .",
    "the character of unitary uncertainties in the nn potential on the lobt calculation is further demonstrated in sect .",
    "3 by using low - momentum interaction , which is equivalent to the original interaction in the low - momentum two - body space . section 4 reports the results of the nuclear matter calculations by using ch - eft interactions .",
    "first , uncertainties due to the 3nf parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed in subsection 4.1 .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 term contributions to nuclear matter energies cancel each other when @xmath8 is satisfied , and this relation is favorable to describe nuclear saturation properties as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the basis of this observation ,",
    "the results with @xmath9 are first presented and the dependence of calculated energies on @xmath0 and @xmath1 is demonstrated .",
    "qualitative explanations of the 3nf contributions are given in section 5 .",
    "summary and some remarks follow in sec .",
    "the coester band of lobt nuclear matter calculations is recapitulated in order to give the basis for the discussion in the following sections .    in the lowest - order of the brueckner - bethe - goldstone many - body theory ,",
    "the energy per nucleon in nuclear matter with the fermi momentum @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where spin and isospin summations are implicit and the subscript @xmath12 stands for the antisymmetrization .",
    "the nucleon density of symmetric nuclear matter is calculated as @xmath13 .",
    "the reaction matrix @xmath6 is determined by the @xmath6-matrix equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes a two - nucleon bare interaction .",
    "the single - particle energy @xmath16 of an occupied state , @xmath17 , is determined from the @xmath6-matrix self - consistently : @xmath18 this definition corresponds to including diagrams shown in fig . 1 in the energy .",
    "as for the unoccupied state , there are some ambiguities linked to the choice of intermediate spectra of the perturbative expansion .",
    "there are two standard prescriptions .",
    "the gap choice takes @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the reason for this prescription is that the insertion for the particle state should be treated as the three - body correlation diagrams and the net contribution of these diagrams is small .",
    "the other is the continuous choice ; that is , @xmath21 for @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", there is no rigorous correspondence similar to that in fig . 1 , because @xmath6-matrix can not be on - shell for the insertion in the perturbative expansion of the total energy . since song _",
    "@xcite showed that the net contribution in the total energy from higher - order diagrams is smaller in the continuous prescription , this choice has been commonly employed . in the calculations below ,",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    nuclear matter calculations in the lobt have shown @xcite that varying nucleon - nucleon potentials predict different saturation curves ; namely , the relation of the calculated energy per nucleon @xmath24 to the fermi momentum of nuclear matter @xmath10 .",
    "the salient feature is that the saturation point of the different interaction , the minimum of the saturation - energy curve , lies in a rather narrow band , in which the empirical saturation point does not locate .",
    "this band has been called as the coester band , after coester _ et al . _",
    "presented such systematic results in ref .",
    "this property persists in the calculations using modern nucleon - nucleon potentials with higher accuracy in reproducing nn scattering data .",
    "various calculations in the literature indicate that higher - order correlations beyond the standard brueckner calculation do not change the situation , although a different choice of the intermediate spectra of the propagator in the @xmath6-matrix equation causes a shift of the coester band itself .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates saturation curves obtained in the lobt with the continuous ( thick curves ) and gap ( thin curves ) prescriptions for the intermediate spectra of the propagator in the @xmath6-matrix equation , using nn potentials such as av18 @xcite , nsc97 @xcite , cd - bonn @xcite , and fss2 @xcite .",

    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    let us , now , investigate a range of the changes of the saturation curve due to the different choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure 6 shows four cases of the saturation curve ; that is , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , compared with the curve of @xmath34 given in fig . 5 and that of @xmath35 in ref .",
    "it is seen that if @xmath36 is satisfied , contributions from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms almost cancel also in the lobt calculations and the saturation curve should be close to that of @xmath9 .",
    "it is noted that the absolute value of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 term contributions is smaller than the mean - field value , eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , through the correlation in the @xmath6-matrix equation .",
    "another remark is that although the choice of @xmath9 works well for describing nuclear saturation properties , a different choice within the relation @xmath37 might be preferred if a specific spin - isospin character is concerned , because while the @xmath0 term gives rise to a tensor component , the @xmath1 term does not .",
    "it is meaningful to understand , in a qualitative way , the effects of the 3nf in chiral effective field theory ; that is , to provide the physical interpretation of the 3nf contributions .",
    "the two salient properties are discussed .",
    "one is the repulsive effect in the @xmath38 channel , which is basically important to reproduce reasonable saturation properties .",
    "the other is the enhancement of the tensor component in the @xmath39 channel .",
    "the pauli blocking plays a central role in both cases . as far as the influence of the 3nf appears dominantly as the pauli effect , the reduction of the 3nf to an effective two - body interaction in the nuclear medium is justified , because the pauli effect is operating in two - nucleon processes .",
    "it is useful to demonstrate the consequence of these effects by showing , in subsection 5.3 , each @xmath40 and @xmath41 channel contribution in the potential energy .",
    "it has been known that if an isobar @xmath7 excitation in the two - nucleon scattering process is explicitly considered , the contribution of the diagram depicted in fig .",
    "7(a ) supplies the ( nn)@xmath42 state being caused by the tensor component of the pion exchange , the attraction is similar to that of the tensor correlation in the @xmath39 channel .",
    "when the @xmath38 interaction is embedded in the nuclear medium , the excitation to the @xmath43 intermediate state is partly pauli - blocked , fig .",
    "the suppression of the attraction leads to the repulsive effect .",
    "this mechanism has been studied by various authors .",
    "it is also known that the pauli - blocking effect for the @xmath7-excitation can be described by introducing 3-body interaction of the fujita - miyazawa type , fig .",
    "7(c ) .",
    "excitation : ( a ) a process to be implicitly taken into account in the description of nn interaction , ( b ) `` h '' standing for an occupied state , and ( c ) a 3nf diagram of the fujita - miyazawa type . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the description of nn interaction in chiral effective field theory , the isobar @xmath7-excitation does not explicitly appear in most cases .",
    "its effects are certainly inherent in the coupling constants .",
    "the 3nf involving these coupling constants brings about the relevant pauli blocking effect .          the mechanism discussed in sect .",
    "3 - 1 is irrelevant in the @xmath39 channel because of the isospin .",
    "there is , however , another pauli blocking effect for the tensor component of the @xmath39 nn interaction .",
    "the strong tensor force arising from the one - pion exchange is one of the most salient features of the nn interaction . in the actual construction of the nn interaction in the one - boson exchange potential ( obep ) model",
    ", the one - pion exchange tensor component has to be weakened to fit the scattering data .",
    "one plausible natural mechanism is the cancellation by the tensor component of the @xmath44-meson exchange in the opposite sign . in the ch - eft ,",
    "the @xmath44-meson is irrelevant .",
    "however , the reduction of the one - pion exchange tensor component is found to be given @xcite by the two - pion exchange process , fig .",
    "8(a ) . as in the same way for the @xmath7-excitation ,",
    "this process is partly pauli - blocked in the nuclear medium , fig .",
    "8(b ) , and the effect is taken into account by considering the 3nf , fig .",
    "the suppression of the two - pion exchange process means that the tensor force is enhanced in the @xmath39 channel in the nuclear medium , depending on the density of nuclear matter , compared with that in the free space .",
    "this enhancement of the tensor component is not expected in the standard obep picture . on the other hand",
    ", it has been known that two - pion exchange 3nfs effectively strengthen the two - nucleon tensor force .    in order to quantify the 3nf effects for the strength of the tensor component in nuclear matter at the normal density ,",
    "the bare diagonal matrix elements of the s - d tensor interaction and those in low - momentum space are shown in fig . 9 with and without 3nfs for the 3 cases of the cutoff mass @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 mev , respectively .",
    "figure 9 is for the case of @xmath9 .",
    "it is seen that the magnitude of the bare s - d tensor interaction is enhanced by about 40 % at the normal density through the 3nf , and this influence remains in low - momentum space with @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "it is interesting that the two - body tensor interactions with the different cutoff @xmath27 become almost identical when they are transformed into low - momentum space , though the difference is apparent in bare matrix elements .",

    "@xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the enhancement of the magnitude of the s - d tensor interaction is seen to become smaller to be about 30 % , which indicates the quantitative effect of the @xmath0 term of the 3nf to the effective tensor force .",
    "the enhancement of the effective tensor interaction in the nuclear medium due to the 3nf might be checked by some adequate experimental observables .",

    "11 in the case of the cutoff @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding energy obtained by the gogny d1s density - dependent effective interaction @xcite , which has been commonly used for a mean - field description of finite nuclei , is included .",
    "the difference between the solid and the dashed curves indicates the effect of the 3nf .",
    "the repulsive contribution in the @xmath4o channel as well as in the @xmath2e channel is responsible for bringing the saturation minimum at the lower density .",
    "the @xmath2o channel is scarcely affected by the 3nf . the largest attractive contribution in",
    "the @xmath4e channel increases through the enhanced tensor component , as discussed in the subsection 3.2 .",
    "the knowledge of these 3nf contributions may be used to improve the properties of phenomenological effective interactions .",
    "it is interesting to see that the results of the ch - eft interaction with the 3nf effects are similar to those of the gogny d1s interaction below the normal density .",
    "it is not surprising that the d1s curves deviates from those of the ch - eft at higher density regions , because the spin - dependent character of the density dependent part is not well controlled by the data of finite nuclei .",
    "while the saturation is assured by the density - dependent term in the @xmath4e channel in the description of d1s , it is brought about by the repulsion appeared in the @xmath2e and @xmath4o channels in the ch - eft description .",
    "the saturation mechanism of nuclear matter has been discussed in view of chiral effective field theory , in which three - nucleon interactions consistent with the two - nucleon part are systematically defined .",
    "the uncertainties of nuclear matter calculations in the lowest - order brueckner theory , which has been known as the coester band , were revisited employing modern nn potentials and their low - momentum equivalent interactions .",
    "then , the results using the chiral n@xmath4lo nn and n@xmath55lo 3n potentials with the three choices of cutoff parameters , @xmath45 , 550 , and 600 mev , are presented . as effective theory , the predictions for empirical quantities are desirable not to depend on the cutoff scale of the parameterization .",
    "the effective parameters fitted in the two - nucleon interaction level vary depending on the different cutoff energy , which naturally bear different off - shell properties , and they are related each other by some unitary transformation . therefore , as was shown in sections 2 and 3 , the nuclear matter saturation point in the lobt moves on the coester band depending on the cutoff energy .",
    "it is noteworthy to see that the inclusion of the 3nf changes the situation and the nuclear saturation is reasonably well reproduced after the 3nf effects are incorporated .",
    "the 3nfs are treated by reducing them to effective two - body interactions by folding the third nucleon degrees of freedom . as explained in the discussion of sec .",
    "5 , this approximation is justified by the fact that the main effects of the 3nf can be regarded as resulting from the inclusion of the pauli effects in two - pion exchange processes of the two - nucleon interaction . it is to be noted that the contributions of the specific 3nf processes bearing new parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , turn out to give minor effects , as far as the relation @xmath56 is satisfied .",
    "the prescription of @xmath8 is favorable for explaining nuclear saturation properties in the lobt .",
    "thus , calculations using @xmath9 are mainly presented as a reference case .",
    "then , the dependence of the calculated result on the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is shown .",
    "if a specific component of the effective nn interaction in the nuclear medium is interested , fine tuning of @xmath0 and @xmath1 may be applied . except for the reasonable choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , being in a natural size",
    ", no adjustable parameter is introduced in this paper .",
    "the repulsive contribution in the @xmath38 state is understood as the effect of the suppression of the isobar @xmath7 excitation in the nuclear medium , which has been known a long time , although there is no explicit @xmath7 in the present n@xmath4lo interaction . in the @xmath39 channel",
    ", the isobar @xmath7 is irrelevant . in this case",
    ", the important effect appears through the tensor component .",
    "the one - pion exchange has a strong tensor component . to match the experiment ,",
    "the strength is needed to be reduced .",
    "a physical and natural cut is provided , with a description of a obep model , by the @xmath44-meson exchange which has a tensor component in the opposite sign . in chiral effective theory ,",
    "a two - pion exchange process replace the role of the @xmath44-meson exchange , and the two - pion exchange is hindered in the nuclear medium to partly restore the one - pion exchange tensor component .",
    "the significant role of the 3nf in realizing correct nuclear saturation properties indicates that other baryon degrees of freedom than protons and neutrons , which are eliminated in constructing potential description , are important .",
    "the 3nf is analogous to the appearance of induced many - body interactions in a restricted space of nuclear many - body theory . though the reason of justifying the reduction of the 3nfs to an effective two - nucleon interaction in the medium is explained , it is certain that a full treatment of the 3nf is necessary .",
    "concerning this problem , it is noted as a final remark that the wound integral @xmath57 of the lobt calculation with the ch - eft potential is somewhat large , in particular when the 3nf effects are included , @xmath58 , compared to that of other modern nn potentials which is around @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests that the convergence of the brueckner - bethe - goldstone hole - line expansion is slower .",
    "it is therefore important in the future to quantitatively estimate more than three - nucleon correlation energies in the nuclear medium using the ch - eft interaction .",

    "<S> the nuclear saturation mechanism is discussed in terms of two - nucleon and three - nucleon interactions in chiral effective field theory ( ch - eft ) , using the framework of lowest - order brueckner theory . </S>",
    "<S> after the coester band , which is observed in calculating saturation points with various nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces , is revisited using modern nn potentials and their low - momentum equivalent interactions , detailed account of the saturation curve of the ch - eft interaction is presented . the three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) </S>",
    "<S> is treated by reducing it to an effective two - body interaction by folding the third nucleon degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties due to the choice of the 3nf low - energy constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the cutoff - energy dependence of the nn potential is explained by demonstrating the effect of the 3nf in the @xmath2s@xmath3 and @xmath4s@xmath5 states . </S>"
