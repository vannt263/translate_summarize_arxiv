    "omega centauri , the most massive globular cluster in the milky way , is unique in terms of its metallicity content , internal kinematics , and structure . unlike other galactic globular clusters , @xmath0 cen shows a wide spread in metallicity ( e.g. norris , freeman , & mighell 1996 ) , with a main metal - poor component at [ fe / h]@xmath5 , a second smaller peak at [ fe / h]@xmath6 , and a long tail extending up to [ fe / h]@xmath7 .",
    "the metal - rich population holds a low velocity dispersion and no sign of rotation , in contrast to the rotating metal - poor population .",
    "furthermore , the metal - rich stars in @xmath0 cen are largely enhanced in @xmath8-process elements relative to those in globular clusters and field stars with similar metallicities ( e.g. norris & da  costa 1995 ) , thereby suggesting that the ejecta from low - mass , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars had to be retained and incorporated into the next - generation stars .    in spite of its large mass ( @xmath9 m@xmath10 ) , it has been demonstrated by gnedin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that @xmath0 cen is not unique in its ability to retain the agb ejecta as found for other clusters .",
    "an isolated formation of @xmath0 cen is thus unlikely , because the enriched gas would easily be lost by encountering the galactic disk .",
    "the most viable explanation for the uniqueness of @xmath0 cen is that it was once the dense nucleus of a dwarf galaxy ( freeman 1993 ) . a gravitational potential provided by progenitor s stellar system and dark matter (",
    "as suggested from dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group , mateo 1998 ) would help retaining the enriched gas and let the cluster being self - enriched at least over a few gigayears .",
    "if this hypothesis is the case for the origin of @xmath0 cen , the question arises : _ where and in what form does the stellar system of its progenitor galaxy remain ? _ dinescu ( 2002 ) first investigated this issue , by examining the possible signature of the progenitor s tidal debris among nearby metal - poor stars in the catalog of beers et al .",
    "( 2000 , b00 ) .",
    "she identified a group of stars with @xmath11[fe / h]@xmath12 , which departs from the characteristics of the inner galactic halo but has retrograde orbits similar to @xmath0 cen .",
    "her simplified disruption model of the progenitor galaxy demonstrated that trailing tidal debris , having orbital characteristics similar to the cluster , can be found in the solar neighborhood , although the concrete spatial distribution and kinematics of the debris stars remain yet unclear .",
    "this work motivates us to conduct an n - body simulation for the tidal disruption of @xmath0 cen s progenitor galaxy , to obtain the characteristic structure and kinematics of its debris stars and compare with various observations showing signatures of recent merging events in the milky way ( gilmore , wyse , & norris 2002 , gwn ; kinman et al .",
    "2002 , k02 ; chiba & beers 2000 , cb ) .",
    "in particular , we show that a recently identified stream of stars at heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 ( gwn ) is a natural outcome of the current disruption model , without affecting local halo kinematics near the sun and microlensing optical depth towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "we calculate the dynamical evolution of an orbiting dwarf galaxy in a fixed external gravitational potential representing the milky way .",
    "the potential consists of three parts : a spherical hernquist bulge @xmath13 , a miyamoto - nagai disk @xmath14 , and a logarithmic dark halo @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the galactocentric distance and @xmath17 denote cylindrical coordinates . each is given as , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 m@xmath10 , @xmath22 kpc , @xmath23 m@xmath10 , @xmath24 kpc , @xmath25 kpc , @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath27 kpc .",
    "this choice yields a circular velocity of 228 km  s@xmath2 at the solar circle of @xmath28 kpc and a flat rotation curve outside @xmath29 .",
    "we set self - gravitating particles in the dwarf galaxy following a king model , where the central density , central velocity dispersion , and core radius are given as 0.3 m@xmath10  pc@xmath30 , 18.1 km  s@xmath2 , and 0.56 kpc , respectively .",
    "in addition , a particle with the mass of @xmath31 m@xmath10 representing @xmath0 cen is placed at the center of the galaxy to trace its orbit .",
    "this setting yields the total mass of the galaxy as @xmath32 m@xmath10 .",
    "a part of the mass is provided by stars , which is roughly estimated from the mean metallicity of stars in @xmath0 cen ( @xmath33[fe / h]@xmath34 ) , combined with the metallicity - luminosity relation for the local group dwarfs ( ct et al . 2000 ) and the mass - to - light ratio ( assuming @xmath35 obtained for @xmath0 cen , meylan et al .",
    "1995 ) , yielding @xmath36 m@xmath10 . thus",
    ", our model galaxy is largely dominated by a dark component , in agreement with the observed large @xmath37 in dwarfs ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxy is represented by a collection of @xmath38 particles and the self - gravity is calculated in terms of a multiple expansion of the internal potential to fourth order ( zaritsky & white 1988 ) .",
    "in the course of its orbital motion , a dwarf galaxy is disrupted by galactic tides , whereas its dense core is expected to survive and follow @xmath0 cen s orbit .",
    "while our calculation in a fixed galactic potential neglects dynamical friction against progenitor s orbit , the effect is only modest for the system of @xmath39  m@xmath10 ( zhao 2002 ) , especially during a few orbital periods required for tidal disruption .",
    "we thus examine two representative orbits for the progenitor , model 1 and 2 : model 1 follows the current orbit of @xmath0 cen , whereas for model 2 , we calculate an orbit back to the past over @xmath40 gyr from its current position and velocity by fully taking into account dynamical friction and then set a progenitor galaxy on its non - decaying orbit .",
    "these two models provide us with satisfactory information on the generic properties of a tidally disrupted progenitor and we postulate that the realistic nature of their debris is midway between these model predictions .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 cen s orbit , based on the distance from the sun @xmath41 kpc , position @xmath42 , proper motion @xmath43 mas  yr@xmath2 , and heliocentric radial velocity @xmath44 km  s@xmath2 ( dinescu , girard , & van altena 1999 ) .",
    "this orbit for model 1 is characterized by frequent disk crossings with a period of @xmath45 yr , retrograde motion , and apo and pericentric distances @xmath46 kpc . for model 2 , we obtain @xmath47 yr and @xmath48 kpc . in both experiments ,",
    "we adopt the same progenitor mass @xmath49 and place it at apocenter to maximize its survival chances .",
    "figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of the tidally disrupted debris .",
    "upper ( middle ) panel shows model 1 ( model 2 ) after the 1.37 ( 1.86 ) gyr orbital excursion of the progenitor galaxy .",
    "lower panel shows the orbit of the galaxy center .",
    "in the course of the orbital motion of the galaxy , its structure is made elongated along the orbit induced by galactic tides , in particular at its pericenter passages , and then the particles are spread out to form the tidal streams along the orbit . a rosette - like feature of the debris becomes steady after about eight orbital periods .",
    "model 1 results in more compact distribution than model 2 , which reflects the difference in orbital radii .",
    "figure 2 shows the velocity distributions of the debris particles in cylindrical coordinates @xmath50 . as is evident , model 1 and 2",
    "provide essentially the same debris kinematics : most remarkable is a sharply peaked @xmath51 distribution at @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 , arising from a retrograde orbit of a progenitor .",
    "these kinematics suggest that the difference in model 1 and 2 resides only in the spatial extent of the debris .",
    "in order to assess the reality of the debris stars in light of observed stellar kinematics in the milky way , we analyze the kinematics of both the simulated debris and other galactic stars generated randomly by a monte carlo method .",
    "the metal - poor halo is modeled as a flattened spheroid @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an axis ratio ranging 0.55 - 0.7 , anisotropic velocity ellipsoid @xmath54 km  s@xmath2 , and small mean rotation @xmath55 km  s@xmath2 , as found for halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath56 near the sun ( cb ) .",
    "thin and thick disks are modeled as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 kpc and @xmath59 ( 1 ) kpc for thin ( thick ) disk .",
    "both disks rotate at 200 km  s@xmath2 , having velocity ellipsoids of @xmath60 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath61 km  s@xmath2 for thin and thick disks , respectively ( cb ) .",
    "the relative fraction of each component is fixed using observed local densities near the sun , in such a manner that the halo and thick - disk densities at @xmath62 kpc are 0.2  % and 2  % of the thin - disk density , respectively ( e.g. yamagata & yoshii 1992 ) .    in our model of @xmath0 cen s progenitor galaxy ,",
    "the self - gravitating particles represent both stars and dark matter .",
    "we note that a correct estimate for the fraction of stars is uncertain , because their @xmath37 ratio as well as the amount of dark matter in the progenitor is unavailable . as a useful method to incorporate this ambiguity for the current kinematic analysis",
    ", we set a parameter @xmath63 as the fraction of the debris particles relative to halo stars near the sun , _ when all of the particles are regarded as stellar ones_. by this , the normalization of the halo density is obtained for the given debris particles .",
    "a typical value of @xmath63 for the conversion of the simulated particles to the stars is estimated in the following manner .",
    "model 1 ( model 2 ) yields 21 ( 74 ) particles at @xmath64 kpc , giving the mass density of @xmath65 m@xmath10  pc@xmath30 near the sun , whereas the total mass density and metal - poor halo density have been derived as @xmath66 m@xmath10  pc@xmath30 ( gates , gyuk , & turner 1995 ) and @xmath67 m@xmath10  pc@xmath30 ( gould , flynn , & bahcall 1998 ) , respectively .",
    "then , if the debris stars ( with @xmath68 m@xmath10 ) are distributed in the same manner as the simulated particles ( with @xmath69 m@xmath10 ) , which would be a reasonable approximation in view of the dissipationless nature of stars , the mass density of the debris stars in the solar neighborhood can be estimated as @xmath70 m@xmath10  pc@xmath30 , which is about 1  % of the halo density .",
    "thus , @xmath63 , defined here as debris fraction at @xmath71 kpc , is expected to be of order of a few percents .",
    "recently , gwn reported a spectroscopic survey of @xmath72 f / g stars down to @xmath73 mag , in the direction against galactic rotation @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where radial velocities , @xmath76 , in combination with distances largely reflect orbital angular momentum .",
    "the @xmath76 distribution of the stars a few kpc from the sun shows two stellar streams at @xmath77 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 , which are not explained by known galactic components .",
    "while the stream at @xmath78 km  s@xmath2 was reproduced by their model of a merging satellite in prograde rotation , the stream at @xmath79 km  s@xmath2 remains yet unexplained .",
    "figure 3a shows the @xmath76 distribution for the debris stars of model 2 and halo stars of @xmath80 ( i.e. without disks ) at @xmath81 kpc , @xmath82 , and two fields for @xmath83 .",
    "figure 3b shows when disk stars are incorporated . as is evident , the debris stars from @xmath0 cen s progenitor form a local peak at @xmath79 km  s@xmath2 , which is provided by many stars having @xmath84 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the @xmath79 km  s@xmath2 stream discovered by gwn .",
    "a more flattened halo than the case @xmath80 yields a higher peak , since the density contrast of the debris relative to halo is made higher in this survey region .",
    "it is worth noting that model 1 yields essentially the same @xmath76 distribution as model 2 , reflecting the same velocity distribution , although to attain the same peak height at @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath63 be a few factor larger and the selected range of @xmath85 be a few degree higher than the respective values in model 2 , because of less number of debris stars near the sun .",
    "this rule applies to other considerations below as well .",
    "majewski ( 1992 ) suggested that the outer halo at the north galactic pole ( ngp ) shows a retrograde rotation @xmath86 km  s@xmath2 at @xmath87 kpc .",
    "also , k02 reported that their sample of horizontal branch stars at @xmath88 kpc shows a retrograde rotation at @xmath89 km  s@xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "halo stars near the sun show no retrograde rotation ( cb ) .    to investigate the role of the debris stars in this issue , we select those of model 2 and randomly generated stars at @xmath90 and @xmath91 kpc ( resembling k02 s selection ) .",
    "since the observational determination of full space velocities involves rather inaccurate information of proper motions compared to radial velocities , we convolve the velocity distribution of stars with a gaussian distribution for velocity errors , having 1  @xmath92 of a typical 30 km  s@xmath2 error .",
    "the resulting velocity distribution shows a non - gaussian feature owing to the presence of the debris stars : the @xmath51 distribution holds an extra peak at @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 in addition to the @xmath93 km  s@xmath2 peak , where the former amplitude becomes comparable to the latter one at @xmath63 of a few percents , whereas for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the velocity distributions are made slightly asymmetric .",
    "however , the change of @xmath96 by the inclusion of the debris stars with @xmath97  % amounts to only @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) km  s@xmath2 for @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , which are still insufficient for explaining the reported @xmath102 km  s@xmath2 . also , if we extend the selection of the stars at higher @xmath103 or instead consider model 1 , the changes of @xmath96 become smaller than the above mentioned values , because there are no debris stars in our current model",
    "thus , it is safe to conclude that the debris stars contribute only in part to a reported retrograde motion at the ngp .",
    "we select the nearby debris and halo stars at @xmath104 kpc , @xmath105  kpc , and @xmath106 kpc ( as was drawn by cb ) , convolve the velocities with a gaussian error distribution of @xmath107 km  s@xmath2 , and compare with the corresponding stars with [ fe / h]@xmath108 in b00 .",
    "it follows that the non - gaussian feature in velocities is much weaker than that at the ngp : the change of @xmath96 for @xmath97  % is only @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) km  s@xmath2 in model 1 ( model 2 ) .",
    "this is due to the smaller debris fraction near @xmath111 than at high @xmath112 .",
    "the effects of the debris stars on the microlensing optical depth towards lmc , @xmath113 , are modest as well . following the gould ( 1999 ) prescription for @xmath113 and investigating the debris within @xmath114 centered at lmc , we arrive at @xmath115 , thereby indicating that @xmath113 provided by the debris stars is much smaller than the observed @xmath113 of @xmath116 .",
    "we have demonstrated that our fiducial models of an orbiting dwarf galaxy that once contained @xmath0 cen predict a sequence of tidal streams in retrograde rotation and their existence is imprinted in kinematics of nearby stars , especially in the direction against galactic rotation ( gwn ) and at the ngp ( k02 ) , while local halo kinematics and microlensing towards lmc remain unchanged .",
    "the streams are mostly distributed inside the solar circle , as suggested from the current orbit of @xmath0 cen ( dinescu 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast to the sgr dwarf galaxy having polar orbit , the orbit of @xmath0 cen s progenitor galaxy is largely affected by a non - spherical disk potential , where the orbital plane exhibits precession with respect to the galactic pole , causing self - crossing of tidal streams in the disk .",
    "the projection of the orbit perpendicular to the disk shows an x-like feature , thereby leaving denser streams at high @xmath112 than at low @xmath112 for a given radius .",
    "this explains the significance of the debris at the ngp compared to the solar neighborhood .",
    "existing kinematic studies of galactic stars to search for a signature of @xmath0 cen s progenitor galaxy are yet confined to nearby stars , where the significance of the debris streams is modest , as shown here .",
    "searches of stars inside the solar circle are more encouraging ( fig .",
    "1 ) , in particular in the directions of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where we expect the presence of high - velocity streams at @xmath119 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath120 km  s@xmath2 , respectively . future radial velocity surveys of these fields including the sample of the sloan digital sky survey or planned radial velocity experiment are worth exploring in this context .",
    "also , detailed abundance studies of candidate stream stars will be intriguing , because such stars may exhibit different abundance patterns from field halo stars , as found in dwarf galaxies ( shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) .",
    "a yet unsettled issue is the origin of a progenitor satellite orbiting inside the solar circle , because dynamical friction alone from the present - day _ smooth _ galactic components is insufficient for shrinking the orbit if it was born at a large distance ( say , @xmath121 kpc ) from galactic center ( zhao 2002 ) .",
    "one of the possibilities to preclude it may be that the merging of a satellite occurred while the milky way was still in the process of halo formation via hierarchical merging of several subgalactic clumps ; successive gravitational interaction among clumps may help reducing the orbital angular momentum of a progenitor efficiently . also , a progenitor may have formed in the vicinity of the proto - galaxy , where the environment of a strong tidal field promotes the formation of a compact m32-like galaxy ( burkert 1994 ) and its high density affords the survival chances until the epoch of the galactic disk formation .",
    "then , if a progenitor retained gas , growing galactic tides induce the infall of gas into the progenitor center and trigger the formation of a globular cluster there ( bekki & chiba 2002 ) similar to @xmath0 cen .",
    "the story is yet speculative but worth pursuing based on sophisticated numerical codes for galaxy formation ."
