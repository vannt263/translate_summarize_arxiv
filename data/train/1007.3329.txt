    "at present , there is interest for studying possible deviations of the lorentz symmetry , mainly since kostelecky and samuel discovered that certain mechanism in string theory can cause a spontaneous breaking of this symmetry  @xcite . some mechanisms of violation of lorentz symmetry have also been found within the context of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "since these theories have not been sufficiently developed , an effective field theory that contain both the standard model ( sm ) and gravity has been formulated .",
    "this effective theory , for which exists a minimal version without gravity  @xcite , is called the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite . although motivated from specific scenarios in the context of string theory or general relativity with spontaneous symmetry breaking , the sme is beyond these specific ideas due to its generality , which is the main advantage of effective field theories .",
    "thus the sme provides us a powerful tool for investigating lorentz violation in model - independent manner .",
    "lorentz violation also arises within the context of field theories formulated in a noncommutative space - time  @xcite .",
    "the idea that the space - time might be noncommutative at short distances or very high energies has been the subject of renewed interest recently due to the seiberg - witten s string inspired results  @xcite , which allow one to connect commutative and noncommutative gauge theories .",
    "a method to formulate the noncommutative sm ( ncsm ) as an effective theory , which is expressed in powers of the noncommutativity parameter , has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the effective theory that results from this formulation of field theories is less wide than the sme , as it arises from the specific idea of noncommutativity of the space - time . indeed , as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ncsm is a subset of the sme . although these effective theories introduce constant background fields that carry lorentz indices , they are not lorentz invariants under general lorentz transformations , but only under observer lorentz transformations . as it has been discussed in reference  @xcite , there are two distinct classes of lorentz transformations , namely , the observer and particle lorentz transformations",
    ". the former class of lorentz transformations corresponds to a change of coordinates , whereas the latter can be associated with a change of the measurement apparatus  @xcite .",
    "a violation of lorentz symmetry would clearly be a dramatic indication of new physics .",
    "since this class of physical phenomenon could be originated at very high energies , their low - energy manifestation only could be detected in those processes that are very suppressed or forbidden within the sm .",
    "precision observables constitute also an unique laboratory to test the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "is the case of the @xmath3 decay , which is potentially sensitive to new physics effects and has been measured with good accuracy , showing no deviations from the sm  @xcite .",
    "this means that this observable may provide stringent constraints on physics beyond the electroweak scale . at the quark level",
    ", the @xmath2 transition contributes to @xmath3 via a dipolar electromagnetic transition . in the sm",
    ", this radiative process first arises at the one - loop order , but still has a relatively large branching ratio because of the nondecoupling effect of the top quark loop and the large ckm @xmath5 factor .",
    "the rare @xmath2 decay has shown to be very sensitive to possible new physics effects in diverse scenarios  @xcite .",
    "its sensitivity to new physics effects has been studied in countless approaches beyond the sm , as supersymmetric models  @xcite , the two higgs doublet model  @xcite , left - right symmetric models  @xcite , technicolor models  @xcite , models with a fourth generation  @xcite , supergravity models  @xcite , the littlest higgs model  @xcite , unparticle interactions  @xcite , @xmath6 models  @xcite , and extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sensitivity of this observable to new physics effects via an anomalous @xmath0 vertex has been investigated by some authors  @xcite in the context of the effective lagrangian approach  @xcite . this effective field theory ( which from now on will be called conventional effective field theory ( ceft ) for comparison purposes ) differs from both the sme and the ncsm , as it is formulated under the assumption that it respects simultaneously both the lorentz and the gauge symmetries .",
    "below , we will see that there are some interesting differences among the sme , the ncsm , and the ceft .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in investigating the sensitivity of the @xmath2 transition to an anomalous @xmath0 vertex that can arise , in the context of both the sme and the ncsm , from an electroweak yang - mills sector coupled with a constant antisymmetric 2-tensor @xmath7 .",
    "this constant background field that arises in the context of the ncsm as measurement of the noncommutativity of the space - time ( usually established as @xmath8=i\\theta^{\\alpha \\beta}$ ]  @xcite ) or as a vacuum expectation value of a tensor field @xmath9  @xcite in general relativity , has not been still considered in the sme up to now , as only have been introduced observer invariant interactions of dimension lower than four that not involve constant objets with two indices .",
    "the fact that this constant background field arises naturally in both of these formulations of lorentz violation , constitutes an important incentive for studying some of its possible low - energy manifestations .",
    "another motivation for studying lorentz violation via this tensor arises from the fact that it can couples with a dimension - six @xmath10-invariant operator constructed only with the strength tensor associated with @xmath11 , which , in its lorentz invariant version , has been the subject of important interest in the literature  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in the context of string theory quantization  @xcite and in general relativity with spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite , there exists more than a simple analogy between the six @xmath7 quantities and the six components of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath12 . for any practical purpose , the dimensionless constant background fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the new physics scale , play the role of an external agent that would induce deviations from the sm predictions , which in principle could be observed in future high - energy experiments .",
    "as mentioned , we will focus on the yang - mills part of the effective lagrangian that characterizes the sme ( or also the ncsm ) modified by the presence of an observer invariant that arises from the contraction of @xmath7 with a lorentz 2-tensor that is invariant under the @xmath11 gauge group .",
    "this extended yang - mills sector generates a nonrenormalizable @xmath0 vertex , which differs substantially from the one studied in references  @xcite within the context of the ceft  @xcite . as we will see below",
    ", the anomalous @xmath0 vertex arises in the sme ( or in the ncsm ) from a dimension - six operator which is invariant under the @xmath11 gauge group but it is a @xmath16-tensor under the lorentz group , whereas in ceft this operator is invariant under both the gauge group and the lorentz group . technically speaking ,",
    "this means that only the antisymmetric part in the two lorentz indices contributes to physical amplitudes in the sme due to the antisymmetry of @xmath7 , whereas only the symmetric part contributes in the ceft , as in this case the lorentz invariant operator is obtained through a contraction with the metric tensor @xmath17 instead of @xmath7 .",
    "this facts make essentially different our analysis from those presented in references  @xcite .",
    "although our main purpose in this work is to study the impact of lorentz violation on the @xmath2 decay , we will present exact formulae for the general on - shell @xmath1 process . as we will see below , the corresponding vertex functions are independent of the gauge - fixing procedure used to define the @xmath18 propagator , electromagnetic gauge invariant , and free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the rest of the paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ym ] , the extended yang - mills sector of the sme or the ncsm at first order in the background tensor field @xmath7 is presented and the feynman rule for the @xmath0 vertex is calculated .",
    "the differences that present this lagrangian with respect the one studied in ceft are discussed .",
    "[ d ] is devoted to calculate the amplitude for the @xmath1 decay .",
    "special attention is put on some features of the amplitude , such as gauge independence and electromagnetic gauge invariance , as well as its finite character . in sec .",
    "[ b ] the contribution of the @xmath2 transition to the @xmath3 process is calculated and used to determine a lower bound for the lorentz violation scale .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ c ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "to begin with , we present a brief discussion on the main differences among the sme , the ncs , and the ceft formulations of effective field theories . as mentioned in the introduction , the extended electroweak yang - mills sector that we will consider here can arise in both the sme and the ncsm , the latter being a subset of the former  @xcite .",
    "therefore let us first to compare the ncsm with the ceft .",
    "the ncsm is characterized by an effective lagrangian of the way  @xcite instead of @xmath7 , as it is the notation used in the literature related with the ncsm . ]",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the usual sm lagrangian .",
    "here @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are sets of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath23 , @xmath26-invariant operators of canonical dimension @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath23 , and lorentz tensors of rank @xmath16 , @xmath29 , @xmath23 , respectively , which couple to the constant background tensor @xmath30 .",
    "it should be noticed that due to the antisymmetric character of @xmath30 only the antisymmetric part of the gauge invariant lorentz tensors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 can contribute .",
    "as commented in the introduction , a ceft is constructed with nonrenormalizable operators @xmath31 of dimension @xmath32 that are invariant under both the gauge and the lorentz groups : @xmath33 it is not difficult to convince ourselves that the symmetric part of the lorentz tensors appearing in @xmath34 , defined through the contraction with the metric tensor @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are present in the ceft , as @xmath37 contains all the operators that respect both the gauge and lorentz symmetries  @xcite . however , as already commented , it is important to stress that the contribution to physical observables of the operators appearing in @xmath38 would differ from those in @xmath34 , as in the former case only contributes the symmetric part of the @xmath39 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 lorentz tensors , whereas in the latter only contributes the antisymmetric part .",
    "this point will be clarified below for the specific case of the yang - mills sector .",
    "we now are in position of pointing out the main differences between the sme and the ceft . technically , the difference between the sme and the ceft is that although both theories are made of gauge invariant operators , they carry lorentz indices in the former case but not in the latter .",
    "in contrast with the ncsm , all the gauge invariant operators of the sme that carry an odd number of lorentz indices can not be converted in lorentz scalars through contractions with the metric tensor and thus no link with the elements of the ceft can be established . on the conceptual side ,",
    "the differences between both type of formulations are even more profound , as the sme represents a model - independent low - energy formulation of lorentz violation that incorporates together the sm and general relativity . on the other hand ,",
    "the ceft incorporates also in a model - independent way virtual effects of physics beyond the electroweak scale , which respects both the lorentz symmetry and the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "thus , by construction , the ceft formulation does not incorporate lorentz violation .",
    "as already mentioned , we are interested in studying the one - loop contribution of the extended yang - mills sector to the @xmath1 transition . at first order in @xmath7 , the extended lagrangian for the yang - mills sector associated with the @xmath11 group can be written as follows  @xcite$ ] vanishes .",

    "it is worth to comment that the symmetric part of this lorentz 2-tensor , namely @xmath44 , induces the anomalous @xmath0 vertex that was considered in references  @xcite in the study of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "its phenomenological implications in other contexts have been studied by diverse authors  @xcite . in this work , we will study the contribution of the antisymmetric part of this lorentz 2-tensor , namely @xmath45 , to the @xmath2 process .",
    "this is the difference between the study given by the authors of references  @xcite and the one that is presented in this work . from the above expressions , it is easy to derive the anomalous component of the @xmath0 coupling , which can be written as @xmath46 using the notation and conventions shown in fig.[v ] , the corresponding vertex function can be written as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 from this expression , it is evident that @xmath50 satisfies the following simple ward identities : @xmath51 the first of this identities guaranties the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the @xmath52 coupling , whereas the last two are responsible for the gauge independence of this vertex .",
    "electromagnetic gauge invariance means that the photon in the @xmath52 interaction only can appear through of the @xmath53 electromagnetic tensor field , which in turns implies that the vertex function associated with this coupling , @xmath54 , must satisfies the ward identity @xmath55 . on the other hand",
    ", the gauge independence of the @xmath52 coupling means that the vertex function does not depend on the procedure used to define the propagator of the @xmath18 gauge boson  @xcite .",
    "these facts are still true in the case of an off - shell @xmath52 coupling .",
    "as we will see below , this transversality of the @xmath56 vertex with respect to the pair of @xmath18 gauge bosons is also responsible for the absence of ultraviolet divergences in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the trilinear @xmath0 vertex in presence of the background field @xmath7.,width=144 ]",
    "we now turn to calculate the one - loop effect of the antisymmetric component of @xmath57 on the @xmath1 transition .",
    "this contribution is given through the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fd ] . before presenting our results ,",
    "let us to argue why one can expect a gauge independent contribution to the @xmath52 vertex . in first place",
    "is the fact that the @xmath57 operator is not affected by the gauge - fixing procedure of the dimension - four theory . also , there are no contributions from goldstone bosons , as @xmath57 does not depend on the mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking . due to this , all the vertices appearing in the feynman diagram of fig .",
    "[ fd ] do not depend on the gauge - fixing procedure . in the @xmath58-gauge ,",
    "explicit gauge dependence only can be carried by the @xmath18 propagators through their longitudinal components , which however do not contribute due to the simple ward identities satisfied by the @xmath59 vertex .",
    "as we will see below , this leads to an amplitude that is free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "after these considerations , we can write the amplitude for the @xmath60 process as follows @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the vertex function characterizing the on - shell @xmath52 coupling , which can be written as @xmath63[(k - p_i)^2-m^2_w][(k - p_j)^2-m^2_w]}\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath64 here @xmath65 , @xmath66 are ckm matrix elements , and @xmath67 . it should be noticed that electromagnetic gauge invariance is satisfied automatically due to the presence of the @xmath68 tensor as global factor in the vertex function .",
    "the evaluation of the above integral is a nontrivial task due to the complicated lorentz structure of the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "however , the calculation can be greatly simplified if we make use of the antisymmetry of the background tensor field @xmath7 and also of the @xmath69 tensor , which is antisymmetric in the @xmath70 indices . due to this",
    ", only the antisymmetric part in these pairs of indices of the @xmath71 tensor can contribute to the @xmath62 vertex function .",
    "then , to evaluate @xmath62 , we have used only the antisymmetric part of @xmath71 , which is given by @xmath72\\ , .\\ ] ] once solved the loop integral and contracting the result with the @xmath68 tensor , one finds that the vertex function can be written in terms of ten lorentz tensor gauge structures : @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for the sine of the weak angle . in the above expression , the @xmath75 tensors are electromagnetic gauge structures in the sense that they satisfy the ward identity @xmath76 .",
    "associate with these gauge structures there are form factors that quantify their relative importance .",
    "we now proceed to present and discuss the main features of these gauge structures and their associated form factors .",
    "we first present the gauge structures of dipolar type , which are the only present in flavor changing processes mediated by the photon within the context of conventional quantum field theory .",
    "this component of the @xmath77 transition can be written as follows : @xmath78 where the dimensionless form factors @xmath79 are given by @xmath80-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m^2_w - m^2_k+m^2_i}{m^2_i - m^2_j}\\left[b_0(3)-b_0(4 ) \\right ] \\right\\}\\ , , \\\\",
    "f^1_r&=&f^1_l(i\\leftrightarrow j)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression , we have introduced the short - hand notation @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the passarino - veltman scalar functions of two and three points that characterize the loop effects .",
    "the complete amplitude involves the following functions : @xmath83 @xmath84 it is important to notice that these form factors are free of ultraviolet divergences without invoking the unitary condition for the ckm matrix @xmath85 .",
    "of course , those parts of the form factors which are independent on the internal quark mass @xmath86 do not contribute to the amplitude , but they have been maintained by completeness .    there is another gauge structure of dipolar type given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\frac{m^2_i}{m^2_i - m^2_j}b_0(3)-\\frac{m^2_j}{m^2_i - m^2_j}b_0(4 ) \\right]\\right\\}\\ , .\\ ] ] notice that this form factor is free of ultraviolet divergences only after using the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "also , it is symmetric under the interchange @xmath89 , as must be .    as already mentioned , in conventional quantum field theory the @xmath1 transition only can occurs through a gauge structure of dipolar type .",
