    "gravitational lensing provides a powerful independent tool to probe the distribution of matter in the universe and in individual astronomical objects .",
    "there are several situations in which the lensing objects can be modeled as an ensemble of point masses that produce multiple images ( microimages ) of distant sources . if the angular separations of the microimages are too small to be resolved observationally , one deals with the macroimage , which is the superposition of the microimages .",
    "a well - known example of gravitational microlensing is the effect of individual stars in a galaxy on the lensing properties of the galaxy ( young 1981 ) .",
    "if the dark matter in the galaxy is in the form of compact objects , the optical depth for microlensing could be even higher .",
    "indeed , the microlensing of stars in nearby galaxies is being used to probe for the possible existence of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) in our galaxy ( paczyski 1986b ; alcock  1993 ; aubourg  1993 ) .",
    "another interesting possibility is that a substantial fraction of the dark matter in the universe is in the form of compact objects .",
    "then the universe as a whole has a significant optical depth to microlensing ( press & gunn 1973 ) .",
    "finally , microlensing can arise in a globular cluster if there are brown dwarfs present ( paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "the main motivation of this study is to give a systematic theory of gravitational microlensing by a random distribution of point masses .",
    "there are different regimes of microlensing and they often require different types of modeling .",
    "first , one has to distinguish the cases of low ( @xmath2 ) , moderate ( @xmath17 ) , and high ( @xmath18 ) optical depth , where optical depth @xmath11 is the fraction of the sky covered ( locally ) by the einstein circles of all contributing lenses : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the projected ( onto the observer plane ) surface number density of lenses with einstein radius @xmath21 ( see   2 ) .",
    "second , the spatial distribution of the lenses is usually either `` compact '' ( e.g. , stars in a distant galaxy ) or `` extended '' ( e.g. , cosmologically distributed compact objects ) .",
    "a lens distribution is compact if the lenses are distributed in a region of scale @xmath22 which is much smaller than the other distances ( those between the source and the lenses and between the observer and the lenses ) in the problem ; it is extended if @xmath22 is comparable to the other distances in the problem .    in the case of compact lens distributions ,",
    "the deflection of light rays is generally small and essentially occurs in the vicinity of the lens distributions .",
    "consequently , a compact lens distribution is usually approximated as a planar ( two - dimensional ) structure corresponding to its projection onto a lens plane that is oriented perpendicular to the line of sight between the observer and the source .",
    "this `` single lens plane '' approximation allows us to pose and explore well - defined questions concerning the caustic structure of the lens configuration , the resulting illumination pattern , the probability distribution of macroimage magnification , the temporal variation of the observed brightness of a source ( which is the magnification profile along a track through the illumination pattern ) , etc . and",
    "while these issues have been explored in great detail both analytically and via computer simulations ( kaiser 1992 ; mao 1992 ; rauch  1992 ; see also the book by schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 and references therein ) , by no means have all the outstanding issues been resolved .",
    "the greatest progress has been made in understanding the properties of single plane lensing under low optical depth conditions .",
    "one of the earliest approaches ( e.g. , turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ) advocated modeling the low-@xmath11 illumination pattern as a superposition of what one would obtain for a collection of point masses acting independently .",
    "an isolated point mass lens produces a circularly symmetric illumination pattern with a divergent spike at the origin .",
    "its differential cross - section for magnification @xmath10 , @xmath23 , is proportional to the mass of the lens and scales as @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "a simple superposition of the differential cross - sections implies that the probability distribution of macroimage magnification @xmath0 is ( paczyski 1986b ) @xmath26 or more generally , @xmath27    it is well known , however , that neither the @xmath11- nor the @xmath10-dependence is correct in the above distributions , even in the limit of high magnification . as shown by nityananda & ostriker ( 1984",
    "; also chang & refsdal 1984 ) , each lens is subject to an external shear from the macroscopic mass distribution as well as its nearest neighbors .",
    "an isolated point mass lens produces a degenerate point - like caustic .",
    "external shear breaks the degeneracy and as we shall demonstrate in this paper , the resulting caustic has the shape of an `` astroid '' and its width is proportional to the dimensionless magnitude @xmath3 of the shear perturbation .",
    "the corresponding magnification cross - section @xmath4 shows a strong feature at @xmath28 .",
    "this suggests that there ought to be a feature in @xmath0 at @xmath29 since it can readily be shown that both the typical magnitude of the macroscopic shear and its random component are of order @xmath11 .",
    "the natural extension of the superposition approach , therefore , is to model the illumination pattern as a superposition of the patterns due to individual `` point mass plus weak shear '' lenses .",
    "briefly , the resulting probability distribution of magnification is a convolution of the magnification cross - section @xmath4 for a single lens with the probability distribution function for the shear @xmath30 . in a subsequent section ,",
    "we pursue this approach and discuss the properties of the @xmath0 thus acquired .",
    "schneider ( 1987a ) adopted a very different approach in attempting to determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0 in the limit of high magnification .",
    "he argued that the high magnification events are dominated by observers lying close to the fold caustics and hence , the illumination pattern is dominated by two images of nearly equal brightness .",
    "this greatly simplifies the problem . instead of having to identify all the microimages that make up a macroimage and then calculate the probability distribution function for their total magnification , one can simply use the probability distribution function for the individual image magnification .",
    "the latter can be calculated regardless of the optical depth .",
    "this approach , however , has one drawback and that is the difficulty in quantifying how large @xmath10 must be before @xmath0 is well approximated by its asymptotic form . in the low optical depth derivation discussed above",
    ", the asymptotic form is a good approximation for @xmath31 .",
    "nonetheless , it should be noted that schneider s derivation is the only rigorous analytic result for finite @xmath11 .",
    "understanding the behavior of @xmath0 at low magnification ( i.e. , at @xmath32 ) is also problematic .",
    "the distribution quoted above ( eq.[[eq2 ] ] ) is not properly normalized as the integral @xmath33 diverges as the lower limit of the integral approaches @xmath34 .",
    "one rather cavalier approach is simply to impose a cut - off at some @xmath35 such that the total probability is unity .",
    "schneider ( 1987b ) adopted a more sophisticated approach .",
    "he argued that a typical observer ( i.e. , one who is not particularly well aligned with any single lens ) will see one primary image close to the unperturbed position of the source and a large number of faint secondary images ( one close to each lens ) produced by strongly deflected rays  the so - called `` diffuse '' component .",
    "then the total macroimage magnification associated with the lensing event is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the magnification of the primary image and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the magnification of the secondary images . assuming that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are statistically independent",
    ", schneider obtained a @xmath42 that exhibits a peak at @xmath43 , is correctly normalized , and has the same @xmath10-dependence as equation ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath44 .",
    "unfortunately , the two expressions differ in _ amplitude _ , a discrepancy that arises because the magnifications of the primary and secondary images are not independent . in fact",
    ", we will show rigorously that the magnifications can be strongly correlated .    in the above paragraphs",
    ", we have hinted at the various calculations and discussion that are to be presented in this paper .",
    "our overall goal is to find an expression for @xmath0 in the low optical depth limit that represents a synthesis of the ideas discussed above and that is both useful as well as physically motivated .",
    "our approach is a two - pronged one . for @xmath45 ,",
    "we perform the superposition of the point mass plus weak shear lenses , allowing for the random mutual shear perturbation . in  ",
    "3.12 we calculate the cross - section of an individual point mass plus weak shear lens which shows strong caustic - induced features . in   3.3 we consider the random superposition of the point mass plus weak shear lenses .",
    "we find that the random shear tends to smear out the strong caustic - induced features of the individual lenses and that the deviations from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) around @xmath29 are at the @xmath46 level .",
    "we also find a simple scaling property for the caustic - induced `` bump '' for low optical depth . for low magnification",
    ", we resolve the discrepancy in schneider s ( 1987b ) calculation by allowing for the correlations between the primary and secondary images (   4 ) .",
    "this gives a formula which is valid for @xmath44 and which agrees with the expression for @xmath45 in both slope and amplitude .",
    "an expression for @xmath0 that includes all the relevant effects is given in ",
    "we compare this semi - analytic @xmath0 with the numerical results of rauch  ( 1992 ) in   5.2 .",
    "while the caustic - induced bump in the semi - analytic @xmath0 agrees qualitatively with the bump found in the numerical simulations , the numerical results show stronger caustic - induced features at moderate @xmath10 for @xmath11 as small as @xmath12 .",
    "the additional features are due to caustic configurations more complicated than the simple astroids of the point mass plus weak shear lenses .",
    "to understand the contribution from the more complicated caustic configurations at small @xmath11 , we consider the leading additional contribution from close pairs of point masses with merged caustics . in   5.3",
    "we calculate the fraction of point masses whose caustics are not isolated astroids as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "this gives a simple criterion for the optical depth @xmath11 below which @xmath0 can be constructed by the superposition of the cross sections of individual lenses .    in the second accompanying paper ( lee  1996 ;",
    "hereafter paper ii ) , we conduct a similar study for the more complicated situation of a three - dimensional distribution of point mass lenses .",
    "we begin by outlining the basic concepts of gravitational lensing , discussing the relevant equations and defining our notation . for the latter ,",
    "we have adopted the notation of kaiser ( 1992 ) , some of which differs slightly from those in general use .    for simplicity , we shall only consider gravitational lensing in an einstein - de sitter cosmological background weakly perturbed by the gravitational field of the lenses .",

    "the unit comoving length is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the newtonian ( peculiar ) potential @xmath54 induced by the density inhomogeneities is given by poisson s equation ( in comoving coordinates ) : @xmath55    let us consider an isotropic point source at the origin of our coordinates and an observer plane which is perpendicular to the @xmath56-axis and at a comoving distance @xmath57 from the source ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the absence of perturbations ,",
    "the observer plane would be uniformly illuminated and a ray which leaves the source with angle @xmath58 would pierce the observer plane at @xmath59 .",
    "this defines our planar lagrangian coordinates @xmath60 . in the presence of density inhomogeneities",

    "( single ) thin - screen approximation , the lens mapping ( [ eq6 ] ) is a gradient mapping with the displacement vector @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an effective surface gravitational potential . for the particular case of single plane lensing by point masses ( for simplicity",

    ", @xmath78 is the ( lagrangian ) einstein radius of a point mass on the lens plane . for an ensemble of randomly distributed point masses ,",
    "the optical depth to microlensing is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the projected ( onto the observer plane ) surface number density of point masses and @xmath81 the physical surface mass density of the lenses .    the generic behavior and",
    "the properties of gradient mappings such as that defined by equation ( [ eq6 ] ) are relatively well - known .",
    "in fact , the gradient mapping has been used to describe a variety of phenomena .",
    "the mapping ought to be familiar to the aficionados of the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) for describing the growth of cosmological velocities and density inhomogeneities due to gravitational instability .",
    "the evolution of the density probability distribution function in the zeldovich approximation before significant orbit crossing was studied by kofman  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional mapping has been used to describe the brightness distribution behind a phase screen ( similar to the illumination pattern that appears at the bottom of a swimming pool ) ( longuet - higgins 1960 ; gurbatov , malakhov , & saichev 1991 ) . in all cases , however , the results give the brightness distribution ( or the density of particles ) for a single stream .",
    "we are not aware of any multiple streaming solution for the brightness distribution at the bottom of a swimming pool , for instance .",
    "the situation in microlensing is quite different in that one must solve the gradient mapping equation to locate _ all _ the microimages , and then sum the image magnifications to obtain the macroimage magnification .",
    "this is much more difficult .",
    "in general , gravitational lensing maps a number of ( micro)images with lagrangian coordinates @xmath82 onto the same eulerian coordinate @xmath83 .",
    "the observed flux of the image with position @xmath84 is magnified ( or amplified ) by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the deformation tensor ( or jacobian matrix ) associated with the lens mapping and @xmath87 is the identity matrix . if the individual microimages are not resolved observationally , one deals with the macroimage which has a total magnification ( or amplification ) @xmath88 . in lagrangian space ( @xmath89 ) , the loci of points on which @xmath90 ( i.e. , infinite magnification ) trace out curves that are called _ critical curves _ , while the mapping of these curves to eulerian space ( @xmath83 ) defines the _ caustics_. in our notation , because we consider a single source and an ensemble of observers , the caustics lie on the observer plane .",
    "this is different from the usual practice of considering a single observer and an ensemble of sources , which has caustics on the source plane .",
    "for a given lens configuration , one can define a differential cross - section @xmath91 such that @xmath92 is the area in the observer plane where the total magnification is between @xmath10 and @xmath93 .",
    "as we shall see , it is also useful to define a `` normalized '' differential cross - section @xmath94 , where @xmath23 is the differential cross - section associated with the simple lens configuration of a single isolated point mass ( see eq.[[eq11 ] ] below ) .",
    "the function @xmath95 is a measure of the deviations of the cross - section of a more complex lens configuration from that of the single isolated point mass lens .",
    "finally , for lensing by an ensemble of randomly distributed lenses , the generalization of the cross - section is the probability distribution of macroimage magnification @xmath0 .",
    "in   3.1 we solve the lens equation for a point mass lens perturbed by weak shear . this allows us to study analytically the caustic - induced features in the differential cross - section (   3.2 ) . finally , in   3.3",
    ", we consider the superposition of the point mass plus weak shear lenses and derive the caustic - induced feature in @xmath0 at high magnification .",
    "the lens equation for an isolated point mass lens located at comoving distance @xmath76 from the observer and at the origin of the lens plane is @xmath96 the corresponding differential cross - section is @xmath97 as is well known , the caustic associated with this lens is a degenerate point located at @xmath98 , the degeneracy being due to the spherical symmetry of the lens .    the degeneracy is lifted if the point mass is not strictly isolated and is perturbed by shear , as in the typical lensing configuration in single plane low optical depth microlensing . under low optical depth conditions , lensing ( other than low magnification events ) is dominated by the point mass closest to the location where the light ray pierces the lens plane and the contribution of the other distant point masses can be treated as perturbations . if we choose a coordinate system such that the dominant lens is located at the origin of the lens plane and expand the perturbations to the first order in @xmath89 , the perturbations correspond to a constant deflection and a small constant shear and the lens mapping ( eqs.[[eq6 ] ] and [ [ eq7 ] ] ) simplifies to @xmath99 where    @xmath100    denotes the influence of the dominant lens , while @xmath101 ( the constant deflection ) and @xmath102 ( the shear matrix ) represent the perturbative influence of the other lenses on the plane : @xmath103    in the last equation , @xmath3 is the magnitude of the shear perturbation and @xmath104 finally , transforming the eulerian variable according to @xmath105 and rotating the coordinate axes such that they coincide with the principal shear axes , i.e. , @xmath106 , we can cast equation ( [ eq12 ] ) into a more conventional form : @xmath107 where @xmath108 equation ( [ eq15 ] ) yields a fourth order equation for the image positions ( see appendix a ) , which has four solutions inside the caustic , and two solutions outside .    for arbitrary value of @xmath3 ,",
    "it is difficult to proceed any further , especially with regards to determining the cross - section @xmath91 analytically .",
    "fortunately , the magnitude of shear is typically @xmath109 and in the limit of low optical depth , is small ( see   3.3 ) . in figure 2",
    "we show the caustic and the contours of constant magnification on the observer plane for a point mass perturbed by weak shear ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "( the results shown in figure 2 were obtained numerically for @xmath111 . ) for @xmath110 , one can observe that the entire four - stream region ( i.e. , the region inside the caustic ) has high magnification .",
    "the minimum ( though high ) magnification in this region occurs at @xmath112 and it can be found from equations ( a1)(a3 ) that @xmath113 at @xmath112 ( also mao 1992 ) .",
    "elsewhere within the caustic , @xmath10 is even higher and diverges to infinity at the caustic .",
    "this means that the light rays that delineate the four - stream region pass very close to the critical curve in lagrangian space . to first order in @xmath3 ,",
    "the equation for the critical line ( eq.[a4 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath114 where we have used the polar representation @xmath115 for the lagrangian coordinate @xmath89 .",
    "hence , the critical line is a slightly flattened ellipse",
    ". we can study the behavior of the rays that pass near the critical line by considering rays with @xmath116 and @xmath117 . if we now rescale the variables : @xmath118 and @xmath119 , equation ( a1 ) reduces at the lowest order in @xmath3 to a simple quartic equation for @xmath120 : @xmath121 in general , equation ( [ eq19 ] ) has either two or four real solutions ( corresponding to the positions of the two images outside the caustic or the four images inside ) .",
    "once the images are identified , their magnifications can be summed to get the macroimage magnification factor : @xmath122 therefore , the magnification inside and around the caustic depends on the parameter @xmath3 in the form @xmath123 .",
    "_ this means that the distribution of @xmath10 over the observers is a function of the combination @xmath124 only and any function of @xmath10 obeys a simple scaling property .",
    "_    we can obtain a parametric expression for the caustic in eulerian space by solving equations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) : @xmath125^{1/3 } +               \\left[\\sin^2 2\\phi\\,(1 - \\cos 2\\phi)\\right]^{1/3 } .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after some tedious algebra , equation ( [ eq21 ] ) can be simplified to @xmath126 thus the caustic has the shape of an astroid , with the four cusp catastrophes at @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) and at a distance @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 ) from the center of the astroid connected to each other by four fold catastrophes .",
    "the caustic shown in figure 2 , which was obtained numerically for @xmath111 , is described by equation ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "one consequence of the scaling relationship noted above is that the caustic - induced features in the differential cross - section of a point mass plus weak shear lens scale as @xmath131 where @xmath23 is the differential cross - section of an isolated point mass ( eq.[[eq11 ] ] ) and @xmath132 is a function describing the scaling behavior . in figure 3",
    "we show the `` normalized '' differential cross - section @xmath132 obtained numerically for @xmath111 ( solid line ) .",
    "the modification of the cross - section at @xmath133 is quite pronounced ( a factor of a few higher or lower ) and the deviations persist over a decade in @xmath124 .",

    ", we investigate the properties of @xmath132 and find analytically the critical values of @xmath10 and @xmath132 .",
    "we will also provide an analytic fit to @xmath132 .",
    "first it can be seen that @xmath132 tends towards unity asymptotically at high and low magnifications . as we have noted previously ,",
    "@xmath134 is the area in the eulerian plane between the @xmath10 and @xmath93 contours . essentially , this is equal to the length of the iso - magnification contour corresponding to magnification @xmath10 multiplied by the incremental separation @xmath135 between the @xmath10 and @xmath93 contours .",
    "it is well known that in the vicinity of the fold caustic ( i.e. , in the limit of high magnification @xmath136 ) , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the distance to the caustic from the center of the astroid . on the other hand , the lengths of the iso - magnification contours are nearly independent of magnification because both in size and in shape the contours asymptotically approach the astroid - shaped caustic .",
    "consequently , @xmath139 .",
    "since the differential cross - section of an isolated point mass also depends on @xmath10 according to @xmath140 in the high magnification limit , @xmath132 tends to a constant value .",
    "in fact , to first order in @xmath3 , the magnification cross - sections of the isolated point mass and the point mass plus weak shear cases coincide at high magnification and @xmath141 .    at large distances from the astroid",
    ", we can solve equations ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) by only considering terms to first order in @xmath3 and using a perturbation series with respect to @xmath142 .",
    "we find that the resulting iso - magnification contours are given by @xmath143 . in the limit of low magnification @xmath144",
    "( but with @xmath145 ) , the contours are similar to those associated with an isolated point mass lens .",
    "consequently , the magnification cross - section converges to that of an isolated point mass and @xmath141 .",
    "the interesting features in @xmath132 occur at @xmath133 .",
    "we can understand these features by studying the geometry of the iso - magnification contours on the observer plane ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "as we noted above , the iso - magnification contours at large distances from the astroid are slightly deformed circles . in going from low to high magnification",
    ", the quadrupole moment of the contours increases and the iso - magnification contours are continuously deformed . at the first critical value @xmath146 , the contour osculates the astroid and due to symmetry , touches it at four eulerian points with coordinates @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath128 .",
    "there are four images associated with each of these points , and we can determine their lagrangian coordinates as well as their magnifications from equations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "two of these images have infinite magnification and the other two have finite magnification ; it is the latter two that are of interest . from equation ( [ eq20 ] )",
    ", we find that the total magnification associated with the images of interest is @xmath149 the next contours of @xmath10 slightly larger than @xmath146 consist of four symmetric arcs around and outside the four cusps and because of the loss of the area inside the astroid the corresponding @xmath150 decreases rapidly .",
    "this explains the first break in @xmath132 at @xmath151 .",
    "next , we consider the iso - magnification contours inside the caustic , i.e. , in the four - image region . the minimum magnification @xmath152 inside the caustic is located at @xmath153 , the origin of the eulerian plane .",
    "using equations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) , we find that @xmath154 [ as we mentioned earlier , the exact solution is @xmath155 for @xmath156 , which reduces to @xmath157 for @xmath158 ; eq.([eq17 ] ) ] .",
    "we can also find the magnification in the vicinity of the origin by evaluating equations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) for @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",

    "the discontinuous jump at @xmath152 described by equation ( [ eq27 ] ) is in good agreement with the jump of height @xmath169 in @xmath132 shown in figure 3 .",

    "3.12 that the shape of the iso - magnification contours has a universal form  every lens produces a caustic with the same astroid shape ( fig .  2 )  and that the normalized differential cross - section @xmath171 is a function of the combination @xmath124 only ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "since the magnitude of the shear @xmath3 varies from lens to lens , there is a distribution of @xmath3 for the cross - section @xmath172 near each point mass . in this subsection",

    "<S> the propagation of light of distant sources through a distribution of clumpy matter , acting as point mass lenses , produces multiple images that contribute to the total brightness of the observed macroimages . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we refine the theory of gravitational microlensing for a planar distribution of point masses . in the second accompanying paper </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the analysis to a three - dimensional lens distribution .    in the two - dimensional case </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the probability distribution of macroimage magnification , @xmath0 , at high magnification ( @xmath1 ) for a low optical depth ( @xmath2 ) lens distribution by modeling the illumination pattern as a superposition of the patterns due to individual `` point mass plus weak shear '' lenses . a point mass lens perturbed by weak shear </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 produces an astroid - shaped caustic . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the magnification cross - section @xmath4 of the point mass plus weak shear lens obeys a simple scaling property and provide a useful analytic approximation for the cross - section . by convolving this cross - section with the probability distribution of the shear due to the neighboring point masses , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a caustic - induced feature in @xmath0 which also exhibits a simple scaling property . </S>",
    "<S> this feature results in a 20% enhancement in @xmath0 at @xmath5 .    in the low magnification ( @xmath6 ) limit , </S>",
    "<S> the macroimage consists of a single bright primary image and a large number of faint secondary images formed close to each of the point masses . </S>",
    "<S> the magnifications of the primary and the secondary images can be strongly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the correlations , we derive @xmath0 for low magnification and find that @xmath0 has a peak of amplitude @xmath7 at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the low magnification distribution matches smoothly to the high magnification distribution in the overlapping regimes @xmath9 and @xmath1 .    finally , after a discussion of the correct normalization for @xmath0 , we combine the high and low magnification results and obtain a practical semi - analytic expression for the macroimage magnification distribution @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this semi - analytic distribution is in qualitative agreement with the results of previous numerical simulations , but the latter show stronger caustic - induced features at moderate @xmath10 for @xmath11 as small as @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve this discrepancy by re - examining the criterion for low optical depth . </S>",
    "<S> a simple argument shows that the fraction of caustics of individual lenses that merge with those of their neighbors is approximately @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the fraction is surprisingly high : @xmath15 . for the purpose of computing @xmath0 in the manner we did </S>",
    "<S> , low optical depth corresponds to @xmath16 .    </S>",
