    "quantum spin chains are one - dimensional models of interacting quantum systems .",
    "they have been used to model magnetic properties of materials , in particular when strongly anisotropic behaviour suggests a one - dimensional modelling .",
    "they also arise as limits of two - dimensional lattice models of classical statistical mechanics , in an anisotropic limit where the lattice spacing in one space direction vanishes . in particular ,",
    "the ising quantum chain discussed below is related to the classical ising model in this way ; and the parameter in the hamiltonian corresponds to the temperature variable of the two - dimensional classical model .    at criticality , quantum spin chains as well as two - dimensional lattice models",
    "possess scaling limits that correspond to @xmath0-dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "the critical exponents describing the non - analytic behaviour of thermodynamic quantities are given by conformal dimensions of certain conformal operators .",
    "for translationally invariant quantum chains , the scaling limit corresponds to a conformal field theory on the torus , and the partition function is a quadratic expression in terms of virasoro characters , distinguishing left and right moving excitations . for free or fixed boundary conditions",
    ", we have a conformal field theory on the half plane , with a partition function which is linear in virasoro characters .",
    "if the spin chain possesses global symmetries , we can define toroidal boundary conditions , i.e. , specific twists at the boundary that do not destroy translational invariance .",
    "however , this does not seem to yield all possible boundary conditions one might expect from the conformal field theory .",
    "recently , such `` conformal twisted boundary conditions '' have attracted growing attention @xcite , and were realised in solvable lattice models @xcite . here , we consider the simplest possible example of such an exotic boundary condition . at least in this case , it is once more related to a symmetry of the model , which turns out to be duality @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the complete spectrum of the hamiltonian is obtained exactly @xcite , even for finite chains of length @xmath1 .",
    "the scaling limit partition function is computed , verifying the result expected from a mapping to the xxz heisenberg quantum spin chain which originally led to the discovery of these duality twisted boundary conditions in the ising model @xcite .",
    "before we come to the particular example of the ising quantum chain , we first discuss the construction of toroidal boundary conditions in more generality .",
    "for simplicity , we consider quantum spin chains with nearest neighbour couplings only . in this case , the hamiltonian for a system of @xmath1 spins has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary constants which are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of local spin operators @xmath6 acting on a tensor product space @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the identity operator on the vector space @xmath10 .",
    "let us assume periodic boundary conditions for the moment , i.e. , @xmath11 , so the last spin couples to the first in the same way as the neighbouring spins along the chain .",
    "we define a unitary translation operator @xmath12 by its action on the local spin operators @xmath13 which obviously commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath14 , so @xmath15 . as @xmath16 , the identity operator on @xmath7 , the eigenvalues of @xmath12 are of the form @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , and define the lattice momenta of the one - dimensional chain .",
    "consider now the case where the hamiltonian has a global symmetry , i.e. , it commutes with an operator @xmath19 , where @xmath20 belongs to a representation of some group .",
    "we can then define a modified hamilton operator @xmath21 by setting @xmath22 so @xmath21 differs from @xmath14 only in the coupling term at the boundary , which is twisted by the local transformation @xmath20 . on first view , this may appear to be no longer translationally invariant , due to the different coupling between the first and the last spin .",
    "however , the transformation @xmath23 is a symmetry of the model , which means that the nearest neighbour coupling @xmath24 commutes with the product @xmath25 .",
    "we thus can define a modified translation operator @xmath26 which commutes with @xmath21 , @xmath27 the corresponding boundary conditions are known as toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising quantum chain is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are pauli matrices , so @xmath31 .",
    "it has global spin reversal symmetry , i.e. , @xmath14 commutes with the operator @xmath32 .",
    "corresponding to this @xmath33 symmetry we have periodic ( @xmath34 with @xmath35 ) and antiperiodic ( @xmath36 with @xmath37 ) boundary conditions , the latter yielding a change in sign of the @xmath38 coupling term , because @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that it is useful to consider the mixed - sector hamiltonians @xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 instead , where @xmath42 are projectors .",
    "duality is a symmetry that relates the ordered and disordered phases of the classical ising model .",
    "it provides an equality between the partition functions at two different temperatures , the critical temperature being mapped onto itself . in the quantum chain language , duality relates the hamiltonians @xmath14 with parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; the critical point corresponds to @xmath45 .    in order to understand the duality transformation ,",
    "it is advantageous to rewrite the mixed - sector hamiltonians @xmath46 as follows @xmath47 - [ ( e_{2n-1}^{}-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2 } } ) -\\lambda(e_{2n}^{\\pm}-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}})],\\ ] ] where the temperley - lieb operators @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 defining invertible operators @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the appropriate duality transformations are @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding duality maps are @xmath55 .",
    "evidently , @xmath56 act on the operators @xmath48 like a translation , i.e. , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and at the boundary @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus the squares of the duality transformations @xmath56 commute with the corresponding hamiltonians @xmath46 and are nothing but the appropriate translation operators @xmath61 of the mixed - sector hamiltonians @xcite .    at criticality , when @xmath45 , duality itself becomes a symmetry , as @xmath62 .",
    "thus we can define corresponding twisted boundary conditions .",
    "this works in a slightly different way as for the periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions discussed above , as we have to consider an odd number of generators @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding mixed - sector hamiltonians are given by @xcite @xmath63 where the operators @xmath48 , for @xmath58 , are defined as in equation ( [ eq : ej ] ) above , and where @xmath64 .",
    "so the duality - twisted ising hamiltonian contains coupling terms of the type @xmath65 at the boundary , and , in particular , does _ not _ contain a term @xmath66 .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath67 are translationally invariant @xcite , the corresponding translation operators @xmath68 can be constructed as above as the squares of the appropriate duality transformations @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which commute with the critical hamiltonians @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , of equation ( [ eq : ht ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of the duality - twisted ising quantum chain can be calculated by a modified version @xcite of the standard approach .",
    "essentially , the hamiltonians @xmath67 ( [ eq : ht ] ) are rewritten in terms of fermionic operators by means of a jordan - wigner transformation , and the resulting bilinear expressions in fermionic operators are subsequently diagonalised by a bogoliubov - valatin transformation , see @xcite for details .",
    "the diagonal form of the hamiltonian is @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "the energies of the elementary fermionic excitations are given by @xmath76 the ground - state energy @xmath77 is @xmath78\\ ] ] which shows the expected finite - size corrections of a translational invariant critical quantum chain with an effective number of sites of @xmath79 , reminiscent of the fact that it is related to the xxz heisenberg quantum chain with an odd number @xmath80 of sites @xcite . with the appropriate finite - size scaling ,",
    "the linearised low - energy spectrum in the infinite system is @xmath81+\\frac{1}{16}\\ ] ] where the fermionic operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 follow from the @xmath75 by suitable renumbering , and where @xmath84 denotes the ground - state energy of the @xmath1-site ising quantum chain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the conformal partition functions are given by the combinations @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , of characters @xmath87 of irreducible representations with highest weight @xmath88 of the @xmath89 virasoro algebra , corresponding to operators with conformal spin @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for the ising and potts quantum chains @xcite , `` exotic '' conformal twisted boundary conditions can be realised by means of twists related to duality , which is a symmetry of the model at criticality .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether this is a more general feature .",
    "if this is the case , this observation might help to identify non - trivial symmetries in quantum chains or two - dimensional solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics ."
