    "kilohertz quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( khz qpos ) have been reported from u by @xcite .",
    "the peculiar properties of its khz qpos motivate the present work for three main reasons .",
    "first , among khz qpo sources , u holds the record for the highest claimed qpo frequency , 1330  hz @xcite , whereas in most sources the maximum frequency for the upper khz qpo lies around 1200 hz .",
    "this is of particular importance because it sets the most stringent constraints on the mass and radius of the ns , under the assumption that 1330  hz is an orbital frequency @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , u tends to have a low count rate and broad qpos compared to similar sources , hence its qpos are challenging to characterize .",
    "second , @xcite have performed a systematic study of the quality factor of the lower and upper khz qpos in six systems : 4u  1636 - 536 , 4u  1608 - 522 , 4u  1735 - 44 , 4u  1728 - 34 , 4u  1820 - 303 and u. using data available in the rxte archive at the end of 2004 , they found that all the sources except u showed evidence of a drop in the quality factor of their lower khz qpos at high frequency .",
    "for u only the rising part of the quality factor versus frequency curve was reported .",
    "the sudden drop is consistent with what is expected if it is produced by the approach of an active oscillating region to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , a key feature of strong - gravity general relativity ( see however @xcite for a different interpretation ) . with the availability of more data in the rxte archive , it is now possible to search for a quality factor drop similar to that seen in other sources .",
    "third , u has recently drawn further attention , after the detection of burst oscillations at 414 hz with the burst alert telescope on board swift @xcite .",
    "the latter frequency which is likely to be the neutron star spin frequency ( @xmath5 ) is to be compared with the frequency difference @xmath6 hz between twin khz qpos reported so far @xcite .",
    "clearly the ratio @xmath7 was not consistent with either 0.5 or 1 , observed in similar systems .",
    "this particular result was consistent with recent suggestions by @xcite and @xcite that the khz qpo frequency difference may not have a strong connection to the neutron star spin frequency in some sources ( but see also the discussion in @xcite )",
    ". a closer inspection of the frequency difference of the twin qpos over a much larger data set is therefore needed in light of this result , but also because a significant scatter is present in the values reported by @xcite .    here",
    "we perform an analysis of more than 11 years of rxte data on 4u  0614 + 09 . in   2 we describe our analysis scheme and present our main results .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in   3 .",
    "we have retrieved from the heasarc archive science event mode data recorded by the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "the data set spans over eleven years from february 26th , 1996 to october 17th , 2007 .",
    "we consider segments of continuous observation ( obsids ) : 763 obsids were analyzed with a typical duration of 3000 seconds .",
    "for each obsid , we have computed an average power density spectrum ( pds ) with a 1 hz resolution , using events recorded between 2 and 40 kev .",
    "the pds are normalized according to @xcite , so that the poisson noise level is constant around 2 .",
    "the pds is then blindly searched for excess power between 300 hz and 1400 hz using a scanning technique , as presented in @xcite .",
    "the frequency range searched includes the highest qpo frequency reported so far @xcite .",
    "we have also verified that no significant excesses were detected between 1400 and 2048 hz .",
    "this justifies the use of the @xmath8  hz range to estimate accurately the poisson noise level in each observation .",
    "each excess ( at most the 2 strongest ) is then fitted with a lorentzian with three free parameters ; frequency , full width at half maximum ( constrained to range from 2 to 1000 hz ) , and amplitude ( equal to the integrated power of the lorentzian ) .",
    "the poisson noise level is fitted separately above 1400 hz and then frozen when fitting the qpos .",
    "errors on each parameter are computed with @xmath9 . as in previous papers in this field ,",
    "our threshold for qpos is related to the ratio ( hereafter @xmath10 ) of the lorentzian amplitude to its @xmath11 error$ ] , where a is the integrated power of the lorentzian from 0 to @xmath12 , w its width and @xmath13 its centroid frequency .",
    "the fitted function is linear in a , and therefore its error can be computed using @xmath14 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the rms amplitude is a derived quantity , computed as rms=@xmath15 , where s is the source count rate @xcite . in this paper , we have defined @xmath16 , from which the error on the rms is estimated as @xmath17 after neglecting the term @xmath18 in the derivative of the rms equation . ]",
    "( @xmath10 was often quoted and used as a significance ) . in this paper ,",
    "our threshold for @xmath10 is 3 , meaning that we consider only qpos for which we can measure the power of the lorentzian with an accuracy of @xmath19 or more .",
    "such a threshold corresponds to a @xmath20 excess power in the pds for a single trial , equivalent to @xmath21 if we account for the number of trials of the scanning procedure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as expected we have found that @xmath10 positively correlates with the single trial significance of the excess power in the pds .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the proportionality coefficient is close to 2 ; i.e. the qpo with the highest r ratio @xmath22 corresponds to a @xmath23 ( single trial ) excess power in the associated pds .",
    "the integrated power of the lorentzian is then converted into a root mean square ( rms ) , expressed as a fraction of the total source count rate .",
    "as said above the qpos in u can be broad . in order to recover properly the parameters of the qpos in the low frequency end ( @xmath24 hz )",
    ", the continuum underneath the qpo must be accounted for . following @xcite , the continuum",
    "is adjusted with one or two zero centered lorentzians .",
    "an example of such a fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ boutelier : fig1 ] , showing the decomposition of the pds into several components .            as a result of this systematic analysis , in 210 obsids we detected a single qpo , and in 24 obsids we found two simultaneous qpos ( in one obsid ,",
    "two qpos were detected but not simultaneously ) .",
    "two tables summarizing all the qpo detections are available in the electronic version of the paper . the remaining obsids , which contained no qpos , were removed from the subsequent analysis . the quality factor and rms amplitude versus frequency of all detected qpos",
    "are shown in fig [ boutelier : fig2 ] .",
    "the patterns identified in other similar systems by @xcite are also seen for u. in particular , in the quality factor versus frequency plot , lower and upper qpos occupy two distinct regions : the quality factor of lower qpos is larger than the quality factor of upper qpos and the quality factor of the upper qpos rises steadily with frequency ( note that the scatter in the quality factor of the lower qpos is in part because it is not corrected for the frequency drift within the obsid ) .",
    "similarly , there is a clear trend ( albeit with some scatter ) for the rms amplitude of the upper qpos to decrease with increasing frequency , whereas the rms amplitude of the lower qpos increases first to reach a plateau ( see below for a full description of the amplitude of the lower qpo ) .",
    "note also that the rms amplitude of the upper qpo , when its frequency is around 1150 - 1250 hz lies above the extrapolation of the blue dashed line , passing through the rms values measured at lower frequencies .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that there is a gap in the frequency distribution of the upper qpo , between 1020 and 1130  hz ( this point will be discussed in more detail below ) .      as can be seen from fig [ boutelier : fig2 ] , the highest qpo frequency detected in our systematic analysis is at about 1220 hz ; hence we do not detect any qpos at frequencies similar to the one reported at 1330 hz by @xcite .",
    "for the 1330 hz qpo , note that our detection threshold ( @xmath25 ) corresponds to a single trial significance of @xmath26 , much larger than the @xmath27 single trial significance reported by @xcite .",
    "still , we have repeated the analysis of @xcite for the obsid 40030 - 01 - 04 - 00 in which the later qpo was reported ( considering events from 5 kev to 97 kev ) .",
    "the strongest excess we could fit was at @xmath28  hz , @xmath29  hz , @xmath30  % , hence with a ratio @xmath10 of 1.3 , a value far too small to claim a detection . note that @xcite reported a larger ratio @xmath31 ; a value closer to our threshold , but which we failed to reproduce ( see figure [ boutelier : fig3 ] ) .",
    "we have tried to optimize the energy band over which the pds is computed to determine whether the significance of the above excess could be increased . by looking at the count spectrum of the source",
    ", it dominates over the background between 2 kev and 20 kev .",
    "we have thus computed a pds of this obsid using only events from 2 to 20 kev .",
    "the strongest excess of the pds is no longer around 1330 hz ( a @xmath32 excess exists at 966 hz ) . by initializing the parameters of the fit with the values of @xcite , the lorentzian parameters are badly constrained ( as expected for a non significant excess ) and discontinuity in the @xmath33 curves prevents us from evaluating the errors . because it is a general property of qpos that their rms amplitude increases with energy , we have also restricted the energy range from 4 to 20 kev , but failed to detect any significant excesses .",
    "we conclude that the 1330 hz qpo was likely a statistical artifact , a possibility also implied by @xcite . a summary plot of the analysis performed is presented in fig [ boutelier : fig3 ] .",
    "we also present the x - ray light curve corresponding to the obsid , indicating no anomalies in the source behavior along the observation .",
    "kev - @xmath34  kev .",
    "second from the top : pds in the energy band @xmath35  kev - @xmath34  kev with a 5 hz resolution , as in @xcite .",
    "third and fourth from top : pds in the energy bands @xmath36  kev - @xmath37  kev , @xmath38  kev - @xmath37  kev with a 5 hz resolution .",
    "the blue curve represents the @xmath39  hz qpo with parameters from @xcite and the green curve represents our best fit after initialization of the fit parameters with the values of @xcite . ]",
    "following on @xcite , we can identify lower and upper qpos based on their position in the diagrams presented in fig [ boutelier : fig2 ] .",
    "one can then align qpos of similar type ( either a lower or an upper ) using a shift - and - add technique @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain a better description of their average properties ; quality factor and rms amplitude .",
    "we have therefore aligned all the obsid averaged pds , containing a qpo with @xmath40 ( either a lower or an upper ) , within a 50 hz interval . as stated above , our conservative threshold ensures that we do add real qpos . through extensive simulations of pds with qpo parameters appropriate for 4u0614 + 091 and statistics comparable to the real data",
    ", we have checked that with our procedure , which leads to averaging a large number of 1 second pds ( several thousands ) , the qpo parameters ( quality factor and rms amplitude ) so recovered are not biased by any statistical fluctuations of the signal around the mean qpo profile .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ boutelier : fig4 ] .",
    "this figure shows for the first time that the quality factor of the lower qpo starts by increasing with increasing frequency and then drops when it reaches a frequency around 700 hz ( the last point for the lower khz is obtained after aligning all the pds with an identified upper qpo above 1100 hz ) . the maximum frequency averaged value of the quality factor of the lower qpo is only about 25 , while in one observation it reaches 60 albeit with large error bars .",
    "the low values reported can be explained in part by the fact that no correction for the frequency drift is applied within the obsids .",
    "at the same time , the quality factor of the upper qpos increases steadily .",
    "the behavior of the rms amplitude of the lower qpo is consistent with other sources : it increases , saturates and then decreases sharply with increasing frequency .",
    "on the other hand , for the upper qpo , its rms amplitude decreases up to a minimum around 1100 hz , after which a second maximum is observed at 1150 hz .",
    "although the minimum was not completely sampled by the data presented in @xcite , a similar trend could be inferred .",
    "as said above , in 24 obsids , we detect simultaneous twin qpos .",
    "their frequency difference is plotted against the frequency of the lower qpo in fig [ boutelier : fig5 ] .",
    "this figure shows that albeit with large error bars , the frequency difference is consistent with being constant around 320 hz .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite using a reduced data set , but with a rather large scatter , with values ranging from 250 and 380 hz .",
    "this value is indeed significantly different from the neutron star spin frequency at 414 hz @xcite .",
    "note also that the drop towards higher frequencies seen in other sources is not observed in u , and our result is consistent with findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have started to investigate how the dependence of the qpo quality factor ( or width ) and rms amplitude with frequency influences their detectability in time intervals of fixed durations , hence affects the observed distribution of frequency ratios .",
    "this is an important issue , because such distributions have been shown to be peaked around small integer ratios in some sources , e.g. 3:2 in the case of sco x-1 @xcite and 4u1636 - 536 @xcite .",
    "this has been used as an argument in favor of resonance based models ( but see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "following this idea , @xcite have shown that in the case of 4u1820 - 303 , a gap in the frequency distribution was present , together with a cluster of frequency ratio .",
    "they showed that the lack of twin qpos within the gap could not be due to a lack of sensitivity for qpo detection , provided that the parameters of the qpos ( rms and width ) could be interpolated within the gap , using values measured before and after .",
    "their result implied a sudden change of the qpo properties within the gap , most likely a loss of coherence of the upper qpo .",
    "as said above , there is a gap in the frequency distribution of the twin upper qpos , between 1020 hz and 1130 hz .",
    "the histograms of occurrence of single and twin upper khz qpos are shown in figure [ boutelier : fig6 ] .        between 1020 hz and 1130 hz , there is only one detection of a twin upper qpo and no single upper qpo detected .",
    "it is possible to evaluate the probability of having such a gap of 110 hz width , with one qpo inside , assuming that the 24 twin upper qpo frequencies are uniformly distributed over their 250 hz frequency span .",
    "this probability is less than @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , giving us confidence that the gap is significant .",
    "as shown in figure [ boutelier : fig6 ] , single upper khz qpos are detected over a much wider range of frequencies and show a highly non uniform and peaked distribution of frequencies ; single upper khz qpos are detected predominantly below the gap , but some are also detected above .",
    "there is no such a gap in the frequency distribution of the lower qpos , 320 hz below ( there are more than 10 single lower qpos ) .",
    "in fact , it is the frequency range in which both the quality factor and the amplitude of the lower qpo reaches a maximum ; hence where lower qpos are easy to detect . after recovering the upper qpo parameters within the gap through the shift - and - add technique , figure [ boutelier : fig4 ] shows that the gap corresponds to the region where the rms amplitude of the upper qpo reaches a minimum .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the absence of twin qpos within the gap is linked to a localized drop of the amplitude of the upper qpo , unlike in 4u1820 - 303 for which the gap was more likely related to a local minimum of the quality factor of the upper qpo .",
    "this result suggests some cautions when estimating frequency ratios based on the detection of single lower qpos@xcite .",
    "clearly in sensitivity limited observations ( as is the case here , where the data are analyzed over comparable integration times ) , the histogram of ratios computed from simultaneous twin qpos will differ from the one computed from the distribution of single lower qpos . the study of the histogram of frequencies and frequency ratios , resulting from the frequency dependency of the qpo rms and width ( see figure [ boutelier : fig4 ] ) , will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the main results of our systematic analysis of all archival rxte data for u are :    * we do not confirm the previous claim of a qpo at 1330 hz .",
    "this is based on a thorough reanalysis of the observation from which the qpo was reported , and the fact that in our analysis , the highest frequency detected is at @xmath43 hz .",
    "this value is fully consistent with maximum frequencies observed in similar systems .",
    "* we observe for the first time a drop of the quality factor of the lower qpo .",
    "such a drop has been interpreted as being related to the oscillating region , crossing the innermost stable circular orbit , and our detection is consistent with that idea . *",
    "the frequency difference between the lower and upper khz qpos is consistent with being constant , around 320 hz , a value significantly different from the neutron star spin frequency ( 414 hz ) or half its value .",
    "* if the drop in quality factor for the lower khz qpo is due to the isco , one can estimate the orbital frequency there , given the constant frequency difference . to do this",
    "we compute the maximum frequency of the lower qpo by extrapolating its quality factor to zero .",
    "this yields a limiting frequency of @xmath44 hz , corresponding to an orbital frequency of 1250 hz at the innermost stable orbit ( @xmath45 ) . as a safety check",
    ", we note that the maximum qpo frequency detected for the upper qpo is indeed lower than @xmath45 . from this",
    "we can estimate the mass of the ns following the equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the dimensionless angular momentum of the star .",
    "this leads to a gravitational mass for the neutron star of 1.9 @xmath48 , i.e. a relatively massive ns , but still consistent with realistic modern equations of state , which predict maximum masses for slowly rotating ( @xmath49 ) stars of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "* u is the second object in which a gap in the frequency distribution of the upper qpo is observed , after 4u1820 - 303 .",
    "this gap is likely associated with a local minimum of the rms amplitude of the upper qpo .",
    "this is the first time such a minimum is so clearly identified , although it was suggested in previous work @xcite .",
    "similar trends will be searched in similar systems , because frequency gaps are present in the data analyzed by @xcite in sources like 4u1636 - 536 .",
    "this result motivates caution when estimating frequency ratios based on the detection of single lower qpos .",
    "we note two additional consequences of our work .",
    "first , our conclusion that the proposed 1330  hz qpo in u is not likely to be real means that no khz qpo source has a confirmed frequency significantly above @xmath51  hz .",
    "this is surprising a priori , because for a neutron star of canonical mass @xmath52 and a spin parameter of @xmath53 , the orbital frequency at the isco is 1690  hz .",
    "such frequencies should have been detected with rxte , hence the wide gap relative to the maximum actually observed suggests a physical cause .",
    "one possibility is that these stars tend to have higher masses , consistent with accretion of several tenths of a solar mass , but other explanations should also be explored .",
    "second , u is an important source to test the suggestion by @xcite that the rapid drop in coherence of the lower qpo is caused by the approach of the oscillating region to the isco . in their proposal",
    ", the orbital frequency at the isco can be very roughly estimated by adding the separation frequency @xmath54 between the twin khz qpos to the maximum frequency seen from the lower qpo after a sharp drop in quality factor .",
    "if the 1330  hz qpo were real , it would contradict this interpretation because the maximum inferred lower frequency is @xmath55  hz and the separation is @xmath56  hz . however , the maximum significant upper qpo frequency is actually @xmath43  hz , which is consistent with the isco interpretation .",
    "this is encouraging , but other sources must also be analyzed carefully to look for potential disproofs of our hypothesis .",
    "mcm was supported in part by us nsf grant ast0708424 .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , michiel van der klis for very helpful comments , and for double checking and confirming in his report that the 1330 hz qpo previously claimed can not be reproduced with the archived data .",
    "we are also thankful to mariano mendez for many exchanges on data analysis , in particular about the way to assess the significance of khz qpos .",
