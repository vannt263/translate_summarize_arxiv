    "calculating the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter is one of the most important and outstanding problems of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "a generic plot of the qcd phase diagram based on model calculations and model independent symmetry arguments is shown in fig.[fig : pdiag ] .    , scaledwidth=99.0% ]    to clarify whether or not there is a critical point in the phase diagram is relevant for cosmology , astro physics and heavy ion collisions",
    ". currently various experimental programs aim at probing the phase diagram at nonzero baryon number density , such as the beam energy scan at rhic , na61 at the sps as well as future experiments at fair and nica . in fig.[fig : pdiag ] we have indicated the approximate initial conditions of the fireballs as they are created in some of those experiments .",
    "also shown is a sketch of the trajectories on which the fireball evolves in the temperature ( @xmath2 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath3 ) plane , during its expansion and cooling .",
    "it has been shown that this evolution can be very well described by hydrodynamics , with a surprisingly low viscosity @xcite . while the initial conditions have to be modeled @xcite , the hydrodynamic evolution relies , at least up to first order , on the qcd equation of state ( eos ) and two additional transport coefficients .",
    "the eos can be obtained by first principle lattice calculations and we report on recents strategies of the hotqcd collaboration to calculate the eos with the highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action . note that due to the notorious sign problem lattice qcd calculations are currently restricted to zero baryon chemical potential .",
    "however , the effect of a nonzero chemical potential can be taken into account by a controlled taylor expansion in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we continue with a discussion of fluctuations of conserved charges such as net baryon number , electric charge and strangeness . as one expects a critical point in the phase diagram at nonzero density ,",
    "fluctuation observables are the most natural choice to detect critical behavior in qcd .",
    "their divergent behavior can give insight in the structure of the phase diagram and has been proposed as a signal for the critical point @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we argue here , they can be used to extract the chemical freeze - out conditions as observed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "after hadronization of the fireball , we expect a strongly interacting gas of hadrons with a fluctuating chemical decomposition . however ,",
    "from a given point on the trajectory , the particle abundances stay fixed .",
    "this point is called chemical freeze - out .",
    "the coordinates of this point in the @xmath5-diagram are usually obtained by fitting the experimentally measured particle abundances to the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model .",
    "those fits have been quite successful in the past @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the freeze - out parameters that are obtained by hrg model fits from various experiments at different collision energies fall on a unique curve that can be parametrized as a function of the center of mass energy ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd simulations utilize a discretized version of the qcd action , which at non - zero values of the lattice spacing is not uniquely defined . in fact , many lattice actions exist , which differ in the way they handle fermion doublers , to what extent the chiral symmetry is preserved and also in the amount of discretization effects they possess . a widely used class of lattice actions is given by various improved versions of so called staggered actions .",
    "they are numerically cheap and preserve a @xmath7 subgroup of the @xmath8 chiral symmetry that is manifest in the qcd lagrangian at zero quark masses .",
    "results that are presented here have been obtained with the hisq action @xcite , that strongly reduces lattice discretization effects over the naive staggered action in two perspectives .",
    "firstly , the discretization effects stemming from the covariant derivative term are improved by incorporating in addition to the usual nearest neighbor discretization of the derivative a higher order three - link term ( naik - term ) .",
    "this term dramatically reduces discretization effects at high temperature .",
    "secondly , the flavor ( taste ) symmetry breaking , which is inherent to staggered quark actions , is reduced by a two step smearing procedure , where the smeared links are projected back to the gauge group @xmath9 after the first step .",
    "the taste breaking results in an unphysical splitting of the pion spectrum at given lattice spacing , which then leads to an averaged pion mass ( root - mean - square mass @xmath10 ) .",
    "although the lightest pion mass ( goldstone pion ) is kept fixed through out our simulations at different lattice spacings the @xmath10 varies .",
    "it can be seen as a measure of the taste breaking effects and is shown in fig .",

    "fig : hisq],scaledwidth=99.0% ]    as one can see , among the three compared staggered actions the hisq action performs best .",
    "the improvement of the taste breaking is most important at low and intermediate temperatures and , as discused in sec .",
    "[ sec : hrg ] , drastically modifies the electric charge fluctuations in the hadron gas phase .",
    "the results that are presented here have been obtained with ( 2 + 1)-flavor of hisq fermions , with a strange quark mass ( @xmath13 ) that was tuned to its physical value and light quark masses that are fixed by the quark mass ratio @xmath14 .",
    "this is slightly heavier than the physical value @xmath15 .",
    "we calculate on lattices with temporal extent of @xmath1 and spacial extent @xmath16 . for the @xmath17 calculations needed to renormalize the eos calculations , we use @xmath18 .",
    "the temperature scale was set by two independent experimentally accessible quantities , the sommer scale @xcite ( @xmath19 ) and the kaon decay constant ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the ambiguity in the temperature obtained by those two quantities at finite @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hisq ] ( right ) .",
    "the quantity most convenient to calculate on the lattice is the trace anomaly in units of the fourth power of the temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this is given by the derivative of @xmath23 with respect to the temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 since the pressure is given by the logarithm of the partition function , @xmath25 , the calculation of the trace anomaly requires only the evaluation of straightforward expectation values .",
    "note , however , that we have to subtract the corresponding @xmath17 result in order to remove the uv divergencies .",
    "_ i.e. _ , for each parameter set of couplings and masses we have to perform an additional @xmath17 calculation , which makes the eos determination numerically very demanding .",

    "note , that the hisq data is not yet extrapolated to the continuum , which may reduce or eliminate the discrepancy .",
    "it is , however , obvious that for the pressure that is obtained by the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , we encounter differences of ( 10 - 15)% for @xmath31  mev between the present hisq data at @xmath32 and the stout continuum estimate @xcite .    the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] shows the low temperature region of the interaction measure .",

    "we find good agreement with the lattice data already above @xmath31  mev .",

    "[ fig : chi],scaledwidth=99.8% ]      in the chiral limit of qcd with two massless quarks the transition from the hadronic world to the quark gluon plasma is presumably of second order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdiag ] ) . at vanishing chemical potential the critical point",
    "is expected to be in the universality class of the three dimensional @xmath49 symmetric spin model and is expected to persist even in the presence of a physical strange quark mass .",
    "it is illuminating to perform a universal scaling analysis that is connected with the critical point in the chiral limit . here to leading order the chemical potential enters only in the temperature like scaling field @xmath50 as a finite chemical potential does not alter chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is thus easy to see that at @xmath41 the contribution from the singular part of the partition functions to the generalized susceptibilities follows the pattern @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the critical exponent of the specific heat , which is small and negative .",
    "the fourth order cumulants will thus develop a cusp in the chiral limit , whereas the sixth order cumulants are divergent with amplitudes that have different signs below and above @xmath53 .",

    "a more detailed scaling analysis using a recent parametrization of the @xmath49-scaling function of the specific heat @xcite is work in progress .",

    "some of them are of immediate interest , such as the transition temperature in the chiral limit @xmath55 or the curvature @xmath56 that characterizes the change of the transition temperature in the direction of the chemical potential @xmath57 . recently the hotqcd collaboration and the bnl - bielefeld collaboration performed a scaling analysis of the chiral condensate , the chiral susceptibility @xcite as well as a mixed susceptibility @xcite . that also determined the normalization constant @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are critical exponents , which fixes the quark mass dependence of the qcd transition ( at @xmath61 .",
    "this was used by hotqcd in order to determine the crossover temperature @xmath62  mev @xcite at physical quark masses .      below the qcd transition temperature",
    "we can compare our lattice results with the statistical hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , which describes the hadronization process in heavy ion collisions quite successfully @xcite .",
    "for the second order cumulants of baryon number , electric charge and strangeness fluctuations this comparison is performed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ( right ) @xcite . here",
    "we plot the lattice data normalized by the corresponding hrg results .",
    "light blue bands indicate the continuum extrapolations based on lattices with temporal extent @xmath63 .",
    "we find that the continuum extrapolations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 approach the hrg from below and are in agreement with the hrg at temperatures up to @xmath66 mev .",
    "the strangeness fluctuations , however , seem to overshoot the hrg and eventually approach the hrg at lower temperatures from above .",
    "note that for the electric charge fluctuations additional solid lines at low temperature indicate hrg results with a modified pion mass .",
    "we have chosen the pion masses such that they agree with the averaged pion mass ( root - mean - square mass @xmath10 ) of the pion spectrum on the lattice at given @xmath21 .",
    "in general , we find that the modified hrg provides a good approximation to the electric charge fluctuations below @xmath53 .",
    "a comparison of the hrg with higher order cumulants is at present not very meaningful as we do not have a continuum result yet .",
    "moreover , for the electric charge fluctuations , which can in principle be immediately compared to the experimental results , the distorted pion spectrum on the lattice becomes increasingly problematic , as the higher order cumulants are increasingly sensitive to an increased @xmath10 .",
    "one thus has to use even finer lattice spacings such as @xmath67 in order to control this systematic effect .",
    "in fact , we find that the hrg results for @xmath68 with a pion mass corresponding to the @xmath10 of our @xmath46 and @xmath47 lattices are indistinguishable from that of a hrg with an infinitely heavy pion mass .      in oder to compare the lattice qcd results with experimentally measured fluctuations one has to eliminate the unknown fireball volume by taking ratios of cumulants .",
    "we have recently proposed a detailed method to extract the remaining freeze - out parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ the freeze - out temperature ( @xmath69 ) and the freeze - out chemical potential ( @xmath70 ) , from a comparison of lattice and experimental results of ratios of cumulants of the electric charge fluctuations @xcite .",

    "we find that the nlo contributions are negligible in the high temperature region and below 10% in the temperature interval relevant for the analysis of freeze - out conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath84 mev .",
    "in fact , in this temperature range the leading order lattice qcd results deviate from hrg model calculations expanded to the same order by less than 15% .",
    "note that one can also investigate the convergence properties of the hrg model itself .",
    "in the hrg model the nlo expansion reproduces the full hrg result for @xmath85 and @xmath86 to better than 1.0% for all values of @xmath87 .",
    "altogether , we thus expect that the nlo truncated qcd expansion is a good approximation to the complete qcd results for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath88 mev .",
    "our results for the strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials at nlo as function of @xmath3 and @xmath2 are shown in fig .",

    "both ratios are almost constant for @xmath88 mev , which is consistent with hrg model calculations .",
    "we do now consider ratios of cumulants @xmath92 , which to a large extent eliminate the dependence of cumulants on the freeze - out volume .",
    "after fixing @xmath93 and @xmath94 by the constraints given in eq .",
    "[ eq : cond ] , they only depend on @xmath3 and @xmath2 . ratios with @xmath95 even are non - zero for @xmath96 , while the odd - even ratios are in leading order proportional @xmath3 and thus vanish for @xmath97 .",
    "ratios with @xmath98 even or odd thus provide complementary information on @xmath69 and @xmath99 .",
    "the simplest of those ratios are given by @xmath100 these ratios can be calculated in qcd as well as in the hrg model @xcite , and eventually can be compared to experimental data in order to determine @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "here we have evaluated them up to the nlo contribution @xmath101 in the taylor expansion of @xmath102 and to lo for @xmath103 . for the discussion of results presented below , we concentrate on net electric charge fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ on @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "while net baryon number fluctuations are experimentally accessible only through measurements of net proton number fluctuations , which may cause some difficulties @xcite , electric charge fluctuations may be easier to analyze .",

    "[ fig : chempot ] ( left ) .",
    "we find that the nlo corrections to @xmath104 are below 10% , which makes the lo result a good approximation for a large range of @xmath106 .",

    "we find for @xmath107 mev and @xmath87 that the difference is less than 1.0% .",
    "moreover , we estimated that taste violation effects in the nlo calculation lead to systematic errors that are at most 5% and thus will be negligible in @xmath104 .",

    "<S> after briefly reviewing recent progress by the hotqcd collaboration in studying the 2 + 1 flavor qcd equation of state , we will focus on results on fluctuations of conserved charges by the bnl - bielefeld and hotqcd collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> higher order cumulants of the net - charge distributions are increasingly dominated by a universal scaling behavior , which arises due to a critical point of qcd in the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> considering cumulants up to the @xmath0 order , we observe that they generically behave as expected from universal scaling laws , which is quite different from cumulants calculated within the hadron resonance gas model . </S>",
    "<S> taking ratios of these cumulants , we obtain volume independent results that can be compared to the experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that the freeze - out chemical potentials and the freeze - out temperature , usually obtained by a hrg model fit to the measured hadronic yields , can also be obtained in a model independent way from ab - initio lattice qcd calculations by utilizing observables related to conserved charge fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> further , we will show that the freeze - out strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials can be fixed by imposing strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints in the lattice qcd calculations , in order to accommodate conditions met in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> all results have been obtained with the highly improved staggered quark action ( hisq ) and almost physical quark masses on lattices with temporal extent of @xmath1 . </S>"
