    "shortly after their discovery , radio pulsars were convincingly interpreted as rapidly rotating neutron stars with a very strong magnetic field , whose rotation and magnetic axes may differ .",
    "radio pulsar profiles were early found to be very stable in time , so it was surprising to find that some were not , even assuming several stable forms , along with nulling , drifting and other pulse - sequence phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we now know that radio pulsar emission displays a wide range of variations on almost all intensity and time scales , from sparse bursts or nulling , to multi - decade fluctuations . remarkably , some objects exhibit mode changes ( or switches ) : transitions between otherwise stable states with distinct pulse shapes , flux densities , polarization properties , and sometimes different slow - down rates @xcite .",
    "the study of these sources is very important , as they provide glimpses into the dynamics of the neutron star magnetosphere and the poorly understood physics of the pulsar radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we concentrate on  which , being the prototypical mode - switching radio pulsar , has been extensively studied in the radio band and is a key target to investigate in more details the high - energy variability of pulsars .",
    "its timing parameters ( @xmath6 s , @xmath7=3.5@xmath810@xmath9 s s@xmath10 ) imply , under the usual assumptions , a characteristic age of @xmath11=@xmath12 ) = 5 myr , a dipolar surface magnetic field @xmath13=4@xmath810@xmath14 g , and a rotational energy loss rate @xmath15 = 10@xmath16 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "detailed modelling of the radio pulse profiles and polarization indicate that  is a nearly aligned rotator ( angle between the rotation and magnetic axis @xmath215@xmath17 ) seen nearly pole - on @xcite .",
    "its distance , based on the dispersion measure , and the galactic electron density distribution of @xcite , is @xmath2630 pc .    in the radio band ,",
    "alternates between two different states : when it is in the so - called b ( bright ) mode , the radio emission displays a regular pattern of drifting subpulses , while it is chaotic , and on average fainter , when in the q ( quiescent ) mode @xcite . the phenomenon of drifting subpulses , observed in many radio pulsars , is believed to originate from a system of sub - beams of radio emission rotating around the magnetic axis @xcite .",
    "the existence of two modes of emission in  indicates that such a structure is subject to some instability of unclear origin .",
    "two short  observations , carried out in 2003 , showed that  is a faint x - ray source , with a 0.5 - 8 kev flux of @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath10 @xcite . for a distance of 630 pc ( which we adopt in the whole paper )",
    ", this corresponds to a luminosity l@xmath20 erg s@xmath10 , and implies an x - ray efficiency in line with that of other rotation - powered pulsars of comparable characteristic age @xcite .",
    "a deeper study of the x - ray properties of   was performed by @xcite , who used five  pointings , supplemented by simultaneous radio observations with lofar and the gmrt .",
    "this first multi - wavelength campaign was carried out in 2011 november - december and provided a useful exposure of about 100 ks .",
    "most importantly , using the mode - change times derived from the radio observations , it was possible to analyze separately the x - ray data of the q and b modes .",
    "quite surprisingly , it was discovered that the x - ray properties in the two modes are different .",
    "the x - ray flux is larger by more than a factor two during the q - mode ( when the radio flux is lower by roughly a factor of two at low frequencies ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray pulsations at the rotation period of 1.1 s were detected for the first time , but only during the q - mode .",
    "the q - mode x - ray spectrum was well fit by the sum of a blackbody and a power law , with single component models clearly rejected .",
    "the spectrum of the fainter b - mode was less constrained and could be described equally well by either a power law or a blackbody . from the analysis of the pulsed spectrum in the q - mode and the timing properties , @xcite concluded that , during the b - mode ,  emits only an unpulsed non - thermal component and that the higher flux in q - mode is caused by the addition of a thermal component with a 100% pulsed fraction .",
    "this interpretation challenges the geometry of  derived from the radio observations , which predicts a smaller modulation of the thermal emission observed from the hot polar cap . according to @xcite",
    ", a strongly modulated thermal component can be obtained with beamed emission from a magnetic atmosphere or with an offset dipole geometry .",
    "@xcite proposed instead an interpretation based on time - dependent scattering or absorption in the magnetosphere .",
    "this requires some global and rapid rearrangement of the pulsar magnetosphere to explain the different x - ray properties in the two modes .",
    "a reanalysis of the 2011  observations was carried out by @xcite , who concluded that the data are also consistent with the possibility that a constant , or slightly modulated thermal emission is present in both modes and the flux increase in the q - mode is caused by the appearence of a pulsed non - thermal component .",
    "to study the remarkable correlated x - ray / radio variability of  in more detail , and possibly distinguish between the different interpretations , we obtained new x - ray observations in november 2014 , within an  large program with simultaneous radio monitoring provided by the low - frequency array ( lofar ) , long wavelength array ( lwa ) , and arecibo radio telescopes . to assess the possible contribution of a pulsar wind nebula to the unpulsed non - thermal x - ray emission seen in",
    ", we also obtained the first high spatial resolution x - ray image of this pulsar using the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. in this paper we concentrate on the results from the new x - ray data .",
    "further studies of the radio observations , as well as a joint analysis of the whole  data set will be presented in future works .",

    "is a famously steep - spectrum radio pulsar , with a flux density @xmath22 at frequencies @xmath23mhz @xcite . as such",
    ", it is best observed at low radio frequencies ( @xmath24ghz ) .",
    "this naturally led us to use the lofar and lwa telescopes , because of their high sensitivity at low frequencies and also because their complementary geographical locations allowed us to continuously track  for @xmath25hr , using also arecibo to bridge the times when  was low on the horizon for lofar and lwa ( the sensivity of both of these aperture array telescopes decreases substantially at low source elevation ) . in table",
    "[ tab_radiolog ] , we present a summary of all the radio observations used to determine the b / q - mode times during the  observations .      was observed with the low - frequency array @xcite for a total of @xmath26hrs .",
    "the lofar international stations in the united kingdom , france , sweden and germany ( stations : uk608 , fr606 , se607 , and de601de605 ) were used because these provide adequate sensitivity for separating s b and q - modes and are less over - subscribed than the central part of the lofar interferometric array , which is located in the netherlands .",
    "also , having multiple stations record simultaneously greatly lowers the risk that there will be a gap in the radio coverage during the  observations .",
    "each lofar international station includes 96 highband antenna ( hba ) tiles , which are sensitive to radio waves in the @xmath27mhz range ( though not the whole frequency range at once ) .",
    "the signals from individual hba elements are coherently summed at the station , producing a combined field of view which is effectively like that of a single - dish radio telescope .",
    "the station signals from uk608 were recorded locally with an artemis system @xcite .",
    "the signals from se607 were recorded with the lump software on local recording machines , while the signals from the german stations were transmitted via the german lofar fibre network to the mpifr in bonn and recorded with lump there . for each station",
    ", we recorded 95.3mhz of bandwidth ( using all 488 ` beamlets ' , of 195.3125-khz each , in the lofar 8-bit station mode ) , at a center frequency of 149.9mhz .",
    "initial data analysis and radio frequency interference ( rfi ) excision was done using the psrchive suite of pulsar software @xcite , and associated scripts from coastguard @xcite .",
    "we folded these data sets using an up - to - date rotational ephemeris derived from ongoing monitoring of  using the lovell telescope ( see table  [ tab_ephem ] ) , but using a contemporaneous dispersion measure derived from the lwa data sets to dedisperse the data .",
    "the arecibo observations were conducted using the 305-m telescope and 327-mhz receiver system in puerto rico .",
    "the pulse sequences were acquired using four mock spectrometers covering adjacent 12.5-mhz portions of the total 50-mhz band .",
    "arecibo rise - to - set observations of about 2.4hr or , equivalently , 8000 pulses were carried out for each session apart from that of november 21 , which was truncated by scheduling exigencies .",
    "these observations were processed into calibrated polarimetric pulse sequences with milli - period time resolution , wherein the modal transitions could readily be identified by visual inspection and then confirmed by fluctuation - spectral analysis ( apart from the final session wherein persistent rfi made identification difficult ) .",
    "the long wavelength array ( lwa ) data were taken using the first station of the lwa ( lwa1 ; @xcite ) , which consists of 256 dipole antennas sensitive to radio waves in the 1088 mhz range .",
    "lwa1 is co - located with the very large array in new mexico , usa .  was observed using lwa1 for a total of @xmath272 hrs in raw beam - forming mode using 2 beams ( each having 2 tunings ) in ` split bandwidth ' mode with center frequencies of 57.15 , 64.5 , 71.85 , and 79.2 mhz .",
    "the observation setup was similar to other lwa1 pulsar observations described in @xcite , however , in order to reduce the data size due to the long observing duration , data were recorded with a reduced sample rate of 9.8 m samples @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting data were then coherently de - dispersed and divided into 256 frequency channels and folded into 1024 profile bins with 60-s integrations using the dspsr software package @xcite .",
    "rfi was excised using a median zapping routine from psrchive @xcite followed by manual zapping of rfi .",
    "the data were reduced to 16 frequency channels for subsequent analysis .",
    "was observed in the first half of each  observation by lofar and in the second half by lwa .",
    "arecibo observed near the midpoint of the sessions and provided an important bridge in sensitivity when  was low on the horizon for both lofar and lwa ( see table  [ tab_radiolog ] ) .",
    "we combined the radio data into pulse profile stacks as a function of time , using the psrchive archive format to store and manipulate the data .",
    "the individual pulses were summed in 5-min blocks of time to increase the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_radio_2014 ] shows a representative sample of the data for session # 5  alongside the corresponding  x - ray lightcurve .",
    "the radio profile stacks for all observing sessions are shown in appendix a. each 5-min integration was qualified as being either b or q - mode , based on the s / n and pulse morphology .",
    "we note that the pulse profile morphology of  rapidly evolves at low radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lwa ( @xmath29mhz ) , lofar ( @xmath30mhz ) and arecibo ( @xmath31mhz ) profile morphologies are different .",
    "table  [ tab_modes ] provides a summary of all modal time ranges and their durations .",
    "the shortest observed mode instance lasted 22min ( b - mode at the beginning of the november 23 observation , but this is a lower limit to the actual duration since the previous mode transition was not observed ) .",
    "the longest instance was longer than 17hr ( q - mode of the last observation ) ; this is , to our knowledge , the longest mode duration ever reported for this pulsar .",
    "we have determined the mode instances using a time resolution of 5-min because the s / n of the profiles using shorter integrations is arguably too low to make a robust mode identification .",
    "we note that while some mode - changing pulsars have in some cases shown mixing between the modes , making any such identification dubious , this is not the case for .",
    "given the low x - ray count rate of  ( at most @xmath32cts@xmath10 ) , and the fact that the modes typically last hours , the uncertainty on the times of the mode transitions due to the adopted 5-min resolution is negligible .    [ default ]    note : the start / stop times have an uncertainty of 5 min . they refer to the intervals in which we observed  in a given mode and do not necessarily correspond to the actual start / stop times of complete mode instances .",
    "a log of the 2014 x - ray observations of   is given in table [ tab_obs_xmm ] .",
    "seven whole satellite orbits were devoted to this campaign , corresponding to a total of @xmath2120 hr , to be compared to the six observations of 6 hr each of the 2011 campaign . due to the faintness of the source",
    ", only the data obtained with the epic instrument can be used .",
    "epic consists of one camera based on pn ccds and two cameras based on mos ccds , covering the 0.2 - 12 kev energy range @xcite . during all observations ,",
    "the pn camera was operated in full frame mode , which provides a time resolution of 73 ms .",
    "for the two mos cameras , we used the small window mode , which is the mos imaging mode with the highest time resolution ( 0.3 s ) .",
    "for the three cameras we used the thin optical filter .",
    "these settings of the epic instruments are the same that were used in the 2011 campaign .    .",

    ", we reprocessed the pn data using the sas task _ epreject _ to reduce the detector noise at the lowest energies .",
    "we then applied a tight screening to eliminate periods of high background due to flares of soft protons . for the extraction of the source spectra we used circular regions of radius 15@xmath33 , while for the background we used circles of radius 35@xmath33 for the pn and 25@xmath33 for the mos .",
    "we used single - pixel events for the pn ( pattern=0 ) and single- and multiple - pixel events for the mos ( pattern @xmath3412 ) .",
    "we first combined the spectra of the two mos cameras and then summed the spectra of the q- and b - mode time intervals of all the observations .",
    "this resulted in four spectra with net live times in the q - mode of 67.7 ks ( pn ) and 113.5 ks ( mos ) , and in the b - mode of 90.9 ks ( pn ) and 162.6 ks ( mos ) .    for each mode",
    ", we simultaneously fitted the pn and mos spectra in the energy range 0.2 - 10 kev using xspec .",
    "following previous works @xcite and to facilitate comparisons with their results , we fixed the absorbing column density to @xmath35  @xmath19 .",
    "this value corresponds to the dipersion measure of   assuming a 10% ionization of the interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the q - mode spectra showed that fits with a single power - law or a single blackbody are not acceptable . with fixed @xmath36 , these models gave values of @xmath37 ( for 20 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ) , corresponding to null hypothesis probabilities ( nhp ) smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "letting @xmath36 free to vary , the single blackbody fit was still rejected ( nhp = @xmath39 ) , while a formally acceptable fit was obtained with a power - law ( @xmath40/dof=1.4/19 , nhp=0.12 ) .",
    "however , the latter resulted in a large power law photon index ( @xmath41 ) and an absorption value ( @xmath42 @xmath19 ) much higher than that expected for  ( the total galactic column density in this direction is @xmath43  @xmath19 , @xcite ) . a good fit to the q - mode spectra was instead obtained using either a blackbody plus power - law model or the sum of two blackbodies , resulting in the parameters given in table  [ tab_sp1_bis ] .",
    "the b - mode spectra were well fit by a blackbody with temperature kt=0.23 kev , while a power - law was clearly rejected ( @xmath40/dof=2.1/20 , nhp=3@xmath44 ) .",
    "a single power - law gave a statistically acceptable fit ( nhp=0.13 ) only with rather implausible parameters ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath19 ) .",
    "good fits could also be obtained with two - component models , but , contrary to the case of the q - mode , the addition of a further component to the single blackbody is not statistically required .",
    "finally , to assess whether there is a significant spectral difference between the two modes , we fitted simultaneously the b and q spectra with a blackbody plus power - law model keeping @xmath47 , kt , and relative normalization of the two components tied to common values .",
    "in this way we obtained a good fit with the parameters given in the last column of table  [ tab_sp1_bis ] and a scale factor between the b and q spectra of @xmath48=0.42@xmath10.03 .",

    "_ there is no evidence for diffuse x - ray emission on angular scales from a few to several arcseconds_. the upper limit on the diffuse flux within a radius of 5@xmath33 excludes a major contribution from a pulsar wind nebula to the unpulsed luminosity .",

    "the simultaneous emission of thermal and a non - thermal x - rays is a common property seen in all the rotation - powered pulsars that have been studied with sufficient sensitivity .",

    "the presence of thermal and non - thermal x - rays during q - mode was already clear in the 2011 data and is confirmed by the new observations , which yield fully compatible spectral parameters .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the q - mode data with the powerful 3d - ml method shows that the pulsed component is well fit by a blackbody and not by a power - law , as found by @xcite .",
    "the opposite is true for the unpulsed component , which is clearly inconsistent with a blackbody .",
    "therefore , we can describe the q - mode emission as the sum of two contributions with similar fluxes in the 0.5 - 2 kev range : a pulsed thermal component , with blackbody temperature kt@xmath20.28 kev and emission radius @xmath221 m , plus an unpulsed non - thermal component , with power - law photon index @xmath22.5 .",
    "although a single blackbody , with kt=0.23 kev and emission radius @xmath230 m , gives a fully satisfactory fit of the b - mode spectrum , the presence of an additional power law is fully compatible with the data .",
    "this yields a smaller emitting area for the blackbody , similar to that seen in q - mode .",
    "the 3d - ml analysis indicates that in b - mode both the pulsed and unpulsed spectra can be fit equally well by either a power - law or a blackbody ( see table  [ tab_ml3d ] ) .",
    "however , from a physical point of view , it is quite contrived to invoke a mechanism able to rapidly switch - off ( or strongly suppress ) the pulsed thermal component seen in q - mode and replace it with a non - thermal pulsed emission .",
    "it is much more natural to explain the b - mode pulsed flux as thermal emission closely related to that seen in the q - mode , and possibly of the same origin",
    ". this is also supported by the fact that the shape of the pulse profile does not change , being nearly sinusoidal with the maximum very close in phase to the main radio pulse in both modes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the best - fit value of the temperature is slightly higher during the q - mode .",
    "the 30% change in temperature corresponds , for a fixed emitting area , to an increase of bolometric luminosity of a factor @xmath23 , consistent with the measured flux increase of 2.9 .",

    "the error regions for the parameters of the blackbody components ( fig .",

    "drifting radio subpulses during the b - mode of  serve as a classical example for associating the phenomenon with the e@xmath8b drift of a system of sparks which are generated at the inner accelerating region ( iar ) .",
    "the theory was first suggested by @xcite , who conjectured the iar to be an inner vacuum gap ( ivg ) . if * @xmath144 * @xmath1450 ( where @xmath146 , @xmath147 being the pulsar period and @xmath148 the surface magnetic field ) , an ivg can be formed just above the polar cap , where a high potential difference exists",

    "the electric field in the ivg separates positrons and electrons .",
    "the latter accelerate back to the polar cap and heat the surface sufficiently enough to generate soft x - ray thermal emission .",
    "the positrons instead accelerate away from the stellar surface and produce secondary pairs , which eventually leads to non - stationary spark - associated plasma columns , where coherent radio emission is generated at a distance of about 50 stellar radii .",
    "the plasma columns undergo a e@xmath8b drift in the iar , which is reflected in the radio emission region .",
    "@xcite were able to model the drifting radio features observed in the b - mode of  as a system of 20 sparks rotating in the outer edge of the pulsar beam as a carousel , with a circulation time of 37@xmath147 .",
    "the fact that this circulation time was slower than that predicted by @xcite , led to the refinement of the iar model as a partially screened gap @xcite .",
    "the basic feature of the partially screened gap ( psg ) model is that the polar cap is maintained just above a critical temperature @xmath149 where positive ions can be extracted from the surface , which can then screen the vacuum electric field and reduce the drift speed .",
    "our blackbody fit to the pulsed b - mode spectrum gives an emitting area @xmath150 of @xmath21500 m@xmath4 , two orders of magnitude smaller than that expected for the polar cap in a dipole geometry ( @xmath151 m@xmath4 , for a star radius r=13 km ) .",
    "this suggests that only a small fraction of the polar cap is heated or that the magnetic field is non - dipolar at the polar cap surface .",
    "indeed such non - dipolar fields are expected in pulsars , as it has been shown by @xcite .",
    "if the field near the surface is not dipolar , the ratio of the surface to dipolar field would be @xmath152 , by flux conservation , implying @xmath153 g. @xcite showed that hall drift of the crustal magnetic field can generate such strong fields .",
    "no clear drifting radio features are seen during the q - mode , so no further analysis regarding the radio and x - ray connection can be established , although , once again , the x - ray data appear to strongly suggest a very small blackbody emitting area , similar to that of the b - mode .",
    "the next important phenomenon is the change of the pulsar radio emission from b to q - mode , where the tip - over occurs over perhaps hardly more than a single period . in the context of inner gap models",
    ", @xcite proposed that the mode switching is caused by transitions between two states in which inverse compton scattering plays a major role in causing the inner gap breakdown . at the mode - switch ,",
    "the gap height and lorentz factor of the primary particles change rapidly .",
    "the transitions can occur when the pulsar surface temperature is close to a critical value t@xmath154 , which , for  and in the case of a multipolar magnetic field , is predicted by these authors to be t@xmath154=10@xmath155 .",
    "considering the uncertainties involved both on the theoretical and observational side , this value is in good agreement with our results .",
    "more recently , @xcite suggested that the effect could arise due to two states of the psg , termed as psg - off and psg - on state . in the psg - off state",
    "the iar is initially vacuum and pair cascades due to curvature radiation can operate .",
    "the backflowing particles then hit the surface and raise the temperature to @xmath149 , where the ions are extracted . in the psg - on state",
    "the surface is already at a temperature slightly above @xmath149 and the dominant process of pair cascade is due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "the ions which are now extracted from the star can completely screen the electric field and no further heating can take place .",
    "thus the prediction is that in both psg - off and psg - on state the temperature of the polar cap is @xmath156 .",
    "one also does not expect a change in the surface area of the polar cap between the psg on / off states .",
    "the change in the intensity of the x - ray blackbody appears to be rather perplexing in this regard , thus ruling out a simple application of the psg on / off model .",
    "the presence of the q - mode precursor in the radio might be invoked to find clues about some additional source of change in area or temperature needed to account for the higher blackbody flux . if the precursor emission is associated with the closed field lines , that could lead to an increased area , while if the precursor emission is associated with an increased return current , that causes a temperature increase .",
    "it has been argued that mode changes can be seen as changes in state of the global magnetospheric configuration .",
    "magnetosphere models can be built which are physically self - consistent solutions of the highly non - linear equations @xcite , including a range of configurations for the last closed fieldline and hence possible polar cap boundaries .",
    "however , these are steady - state models and give no hint as to what triggers a change from one state to another . nor",
    "do they give the timescale of the mode durations and - especially - explain why certain states are preferred over others ( and why , it seems , only two ? ) .",
    "radio observations of other pulsars give clues that mode - changing involves not only the polar cap but the whole magnetosphere .",
    "notably , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite reported evidence for a relation between radio mode switching and changes in period derivative suggesting abrupt changes in the rate of angular momentum loss caused by sudden changes in magnetospheric currents along the open field lines .",
    "such changes in magnetospheric currents could presumably be responsible for switches in non - thermal magnetospheric emission as well as in emitted thermal x - rays due to enhanced heating or changes in hot spot area .",
    "furthermore , psr b182209 , a nearly orthogonal rotator in which we can observe both poles , has two distinct modes : one with a regular pulse modulation and one largely chaotic in a manner resembling  @xcite .",
    "the modulations are in phase at both poles and the modes change rapidly and near - simultaneously at both poles on a timescale of minutes .",
    "this suggests inter - pole communication .",
    "similar phase - locked pulse modulation between poles has also been found in psr b170219 and psr b105552 @xcite .",
    "it may be that communication between poles is only possible when a pulsar is highly inclined , but it may simply be that this effect can only be observed when both poles are visible . if communication is possible for any modulating or mode - changing pulsar , we may speculate that it is also occurring in",
    ". the obvious line of communication would be via the magnetic fieldlines at or close to the polar cap boundary .",
    "if modulation with the observed precision of the b - mode were occurring at both poles it would challenge the view that the drifting subpulses are the product of e@xmath8b drift in a local multipole configuration ( it being already hard to understand how sparks could form a perfect carousel in such an environment ) and would require the presence of magnetosphere - wide drift similar to auroral phenomena ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the e@xmath8b drift is a global phenomenon , one might expect a precise short @xmath157 modulation , such as that found in , only to be sustainable for any length of time in the near - symmetry of a nearly - aligned pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "thus , although the b - mode can be seen as a steady magnetospheric eigenstate , the specific fieldlines of communication between the poles would themselves gradually evolve as a result of the slight misalignment of the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "eventually the delicately - maintained eigenstate would suddenly collapse and a chaotic q - mode ensue until the b - mode eigenstate could assert itself again . in this picture",
    "the observed temperature difference between the modes might be a consequence of the mode change and its evolution , rather than its cause , and the same could be argued for the non - thermal emission .      the 3d - ml analysis has shown that the pulsed component in the q - mode is thermal , and the same conclusion may also hold for the b - mode , although with less certainty .",
    "the high pulsed fraction of this component is rather puzzling , since the radio emission properties have long suggested that  is an aligned rotator , and hence the polar cap hot spot should not give rise to strongly pulsed x - rays .    to address this issue in some quantitative detail we computed the radiation intensity @xmath158 emerging from a plane - parallel , magnetized atmosphere with @xmath159 along the vertical axis , as appropriate if the hot cap is at the magnetic pole ; here @xmath99 is the photon energy at the surface of the star and @xmath160 is the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the ray direction .",
    "the magnetic field strength is @xmath161 and we take an effective temperature , at infinity , of @xmath162 ; the star mass and radius are @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "the atmosphere composition is pure h and complete ionization is assumed ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath165 is then used to derive the pulse profiles , by mean of the technique described in @xcite , which accounts for general - relativistic ray - bending and applies to circular spots of arbitrary size .",
    "actually , since here the cap radius is @xmath166 , the emitting spot is virtually point - like and the use of a single atmospheric model is fully justified . in order to make the comparison with observational data meaningful , in computing the pulsed fraction the contribution of an unpulsed power - law component with the appropriate spectral parameters was taken into account .",
    "the light blue region in fig .",
    "[ fig_pf ] shows the computed values of the pulsed fraction for the most likely ranges of the two geometrical angles , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( @xcite , @xmath100 is the angle between the magnetic and rotation axis , @xmath169 is the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight ) .",
    "the computed pulsed fraction increases with energy then drops above @xmath170 kev where the power - law flux becomes dominant , but it is systematically too low to account for the observed values , especially in the q mode . in a similar computation , @xcite adopted an atmosphere model with @xmath171 .",
    "we recomputed the pulsed fraction following the same approach outlined above , but with an effective temperature of @xmath172 . while the pulsed fractions in this case are somehow higher ( darker region in fig .",
    "[ fig_pf ] ) , they still fail to account for the observed ones .",
    "the pulsed fractions computed by storch et al . , corrected for the presence of an unpulsed component , are closer to the data , although they still underpredict the observed values ( see the dashed line in fig .  [ fig_pf ] ) .",
    "the main difference between the two approaches is in our assumption of complete ionization , while @xcite used a partially ionized atmosphere .",
    "surprisingly , the effect on the pulsed fraction is quite substantial , despite the fraction of neutral h atoms for the typical values of the temperature and magnetic field relevant to  is well below @xmath173 @xcite .    given the uncertainties in parameters ( @xmath174 , @xmath13 ) and in the physical conditions of the atmosphere , one may tentatively conclude that magnetic beaming in an atmosphere on top of the heated polar cap can reproduce the large observed pulsed fraction , and its dependence on energy , for values of the two geometrical angles @xmath100 and @xmath169 in the range derived by radio observations .",
    "finally , having achieved a reasonable characterisation of the x - ray components in the b- and q - modes , we turned our attention to see if our extensive observations could tell us anything about the evolution of these characteristics _ within _ the modes .",
    "a noticeable change in the pulsar radio profile shape and in the drifting feature occurs during the course of the b - mode @xcite .",
    "the work by @xcite revealed that , based on the carousel model , the drift change could be produced by a 10% increase in the average number of sub - beams and a 16% increase in the carousel circulation time .",
    "they speculated that under the psg model the increase in circulation time should be related to a temperature change of about 1.4% across the b - mode .",
    "such a small change is clearly consistent with our x - ray data , but unfortunately can not be detected with the current instrumentation .    in section [ sec_evo ]",
    "we presented marginal evidence for an increase of the pulsed fraction during b - mode .",
    "we note that , if this occurs on the same timescale of the evolution of the radio properties , our analysis underestimates its significance since the optimal boundary , with more plentiful x - ray counts , would have been , say , 1.5 hours , rather than the selected 3 hours .",
    "the failure to detect pulsations in b - mode during the 2011 observations , in which the later stages of the b - mode were poorly covered @xcite , might be taken as an other indication in favor of an evolution of the pulsed flux .",
    "if this effect is confirmed with more x - ray data , its study can provide interesting clues for the understanding of the processes responsible for the mode - switching behavior of .",
    "thanks to the long duration of the  large program with simultaneous lofar , lwa and arecibo radio monitoring carried out in 2014 , we obtained several new results on the x - ray emission of the prototypal bimodal radio pulsar .",
    "though the cause for the x - ray variability correlated with the radio modes remains unknown , we could explore in much more detail some of the scenarios that were proposed to explain the remarkable x - ray spectral and timing properties of this pulsar .",
    "in particular , the discovery of pulsations in the b - mode and the failure of a single power - law to fit the b - mode spectrum rule out simple interpretations which tried to explain the difference between the two modes as a change in a single pulsed component , present only during the q - mode @xcite .",
    "we showed that the situation is indeed more complex , and propose a consistent picture in which pulsed thermal and unpulsed non - thermal emission are simultaneously present in both radio modes and vary in a correlated way .",
    "such a correlation is not surprising in the framework of the vacuum gap models discussed above , since the pairs are produced relatively close to the star surface and the accelerated particles are responsible both for the non - thermal emission in the magnetosphere and for the heating of the polar regions through return currents .",
    "a quantitative assessment of the relation between thermal and non - thermal emission by comparing different neutron stars is complicated by the presence of other factors , e.g. orientation , magnetic field strength , age , which introduce a variance in the observed properties . in the case of  we",
    "have instead the unique possibility to examine the relation between these components without such complications .    on the other hand , space charge limited flow models with particles leaving freely the star surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , predict the pair - creation front much higher in the magnetosphere .",
    "since in this case only a few percent of the return particles might reach the surface , one would not naturally expect a correlation beteween the thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "finally , we found some evidence for an evolution of the timing properties during the b - mode , which , if confirmed , can provide another important diagnostic to study the correlation between radio and x - ray properties in  and shed light on the physical processes responsible for the mode switching behavior .",
