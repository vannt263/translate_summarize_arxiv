    "up to the energy scale we can test experimentally , the standard model ( sm ) well describes the forces between matter particles except for the gravity .",
    "almost all the candidates for the theory of the gravity at planck scale @xmath8 are defined with the supersymmetry ( susy ) in more than 4-dimensional ( 4d ) space - time , such as supergravity or superstring theory .",
    "it is considered that the sm particles lie in higher dimensional space - time and extra dimensions are compactified smaller than the size we can detect in the low energy experiments or lie on the 4d subspace in higher dimensional space - time .",
    "recent interesting suggestion is that sm may be realized on a ` brane ' which stands for the lower dimensional object in the higher dimensional space - time .",
    "one of the candidates of such object is d - brane or domain wall .",
    "we call such scenario ` brane world model . '",
    "the brane world models now casting new ideas on physics beyond the sm .",
    "for example recent studies in the superstring theory provide us some concrete examples realizing sm in the d - brane systems @xcite .",
    "basis of the sm is a spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking that results in the existence of the massive gauge bosons , w and z. we need at least one ( doublet ) scalar field , called higgs field which develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to give a masses to the w and z gauge bosons and breaks the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "these gauge boson masses are related to the electroweak scale @xmath9 at which the sm gauge symmetry is broken as @xmath10 .",
    "the mass scale of the w and z gauge bosons shows that @xmath9 is of the order tev scale , while the gravitational scale , namely planck scale @xmath8 is of the order @xmath11 gev .",
    "if we consider the unification of sm and gravity , we should explain the hierarchical structure between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "since the mass of the scalar field is not protected by any symmetries , the radiative correction brings the higgs mass to the fundamental scale @xmath8 without a fine tuning .",
    "this is so called ` hierarchy ' or ` fine tuning ' problem .",
    "there are two remarkable brane world models solving this hierarchy problem .",
    "one is the large extra dimension scenario @xcite and the other is the warped extra dimension scenario in randall - sundrum ( rs ) brane world @xcite .",
    "susy enables to stabilize the scalar mass against the radiative correction of @xmath12 because it is related to the mass of the fermionic superpartner that can be protected by appropriate symmetry .",
    "so the susy permits the light scalar field like higgs field , however if we introduce it around the tev scale in order to keep the higgs mass @xmath13 tev , all the fermions in the sm have their scalar partners with their masses around tev .",
    "these extra scalar fields have not been observed in any experiments yet .",
    "thus we need some mechanisms in the susy breaking process to control these extra light scalars not to appear inside the region of the present experimental observation . however , the supertrace theorem predicts lighter scalar partners than the fermions in sm that is not consistent with the experimental results . to avoid this problem",
    "the theory should have the ` hidden sector ' where susy is broken .",
    "a certain mediation mechanism to communicate it to the ` visible sector ' is required at the loop level through renormalizable interactions or at the tree level through unrenormalizable interactions .",
    "recently some people consider that the hidden sector setup merges into the brane world picture , that separates the hidden and visible sector by spatiality in the extra dimension .",
    "they use the bulk ( moduli ) fields to communicate the susy breaking signals from the hidden to the visible sector @xcite .",
    "the hidden sector is the minimal requirement from the supertrace theorem and we need more severe conditions to the susy breaking from the experiment .",
    "one of them is from the supersymmetric flavor problem , that is the masses of the sm fermions are disjointed each other while the masses of their scalar partners are almost degenerate .    as we see above",
    "almost all the problems in the tev scale susy come from too much light extra fields in addition to the sm one .",
    "we need complicated setup about susy breaking ( and its mediation ) mechanism to avoid these problems .",
    "remember that susy itself is needed for the consistency of the quantum theory of gravity , while ` tev scale susy ' is required in order to stabilize the electroweak scale @xmath9 , and to realize gauge coupling unification .",
    "however , in a recent brane world picture , there is a possibility that the strong and electroweak gauge group come from the different brane . in this case",
    "the unification of sm and gravity is able to occur directly without grand unification and the gauge coupling unification in mssm may be accidental .",
    "we can also consider the case that gauge coupling unification is not depend on the tev scale susy ( mssm ) and it happens by the other mechanism , e.g. extra dimensional effect @xcite . if there is another mechanism to stabilize mass of the higgs field , it is possible to break susy at higher energy scale , even around the planck scale .",
    "such a mechanism can set susy free from any problems at tev scale .",
    "in this paper we notice the recent suggestions that the electroweak ( chiral ) symmetry is broken down dynamically by the gauge interaction in more than 4d space - time @xcite .",
    "the higher dimensional gauge theory may realize the stabilization of a light higgs field through the composite higgs scenario .",
    "this is based on the idea that the gauge theory in compact extra dimension has kaluza - klein ( kk ) massive gauge bosons and they act as a binding force between fermion and anti - fermion that results in the composite scalar field .",
    "it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite a negative curvature and a finite size effects enhance dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "if sm is embedded in a brane world , the dynamical mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking can be realized in a certain bulk gauge theory ( or sm itself in the bulk . )",
    "sm in the bulk has a possibility to realize top quark condensation scenario @xcite in the brane world .",
    "it is very interesting because it may have no extra field ( elementary higgs , techni - color gauge boson , techni - fermion etc . )",
    "except for the sm contents ( without elementary higgs ) in order to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "we launched a plan to study the dynamical symmetry breaking in the brane world models in detail .",
    "there is no enough knowledge about the ( non - perturbative ) dynamics of the higher dimensional gauge theory in brane world . in this paper",

    "in this paper we analyze dynamical symmetry breaking on the four dimensional brane with bulk gauge theory in various brane world models .",

    "thus we conclude that the bulk gluon self interactions @xmath93 ,",
    "i.e. the power low running coupling , act as a suppression factor for the dynamical mass on the brane .",
    "we have studied the basic structure of dynamical symmetry breaking on the four dimensional brane in the bulk yang - mills theory ( qcd ) . using the 4d effective theory of the bulk qcd and the improved ladder sd equation , we have found that the dynamical mass scale can be affected by the _ reduced _ cutoff scales on the brane .",
    "starting from the yang - mills theory in @xmath16 space - time which couples to a fermion on the four dimensional brane we derive four dimensional effective theory by kk reduction .",
    "we take @xmath217 @xmath218 gauge in extra directions but leave the gauge fixing parameter free parallel to the brane .",
    "our system needs a proper regularization because it is a theory beyond four dimensional space - time where the gauge theory is unrenomalizabele .",

    "the reduced scale should be equal to the fundamental scale in the original bulk yang - mills theory , i.e. @xmath219 . the rs brane world , however , has a reduced scale suppressed by the warp factor , that is @xmath220 which depends on the position in the extra direction",
    ".    based on the 4d effective theory we derive the sd equation for the fermion propagator on the brane . from the four dimensional point of view",
    "the equation corresponds to the simultaneous integral equation .",
    "the loop integral consists of one massless and @xmath96 massive vector field where @xmath96 is the number of the kk modes under the reduced cutoff scale . using the iteration method",
    "we numerically solve it for typical values of radius , @xmath180 , and the ( ads ) curvature scale , @xmath221 . in order to make the analysis consistent with the qed like ward - takahashi identity",
    ", we choose the appropriate value of the gauge fixing parameter for each analysis .",
    "the results of the numerical analysis is as follows . for a flat extra dimension @xmath206 the dynamical mass of the brane fermion is the same scale as the usual 4d qcd result ,",
    "i.e. there is little contribution from the kk excited gauge boson .",
    "we also study the case of the flat brane world with more than one extra dimension .",
    "the numerical analysis of the sd equation shows that the number of the extra dimension must be no less than three , @xmath1 , to generate the tev scale dynamical fermion mass on the brane .",
    "therefore it is obtained in the case of the yang - mills theory in seven or more dimensional bulk space - time .",
    "the rs brane world has one extra dimension which corresponds to @xmath206 case but it is curved . because the gauge boson kk excited modes localized at the @xmath2 brane due to the curvature effect ( see fig.[fig : wf ] ) , we have a significant result .",
    "the dynamical mass of the brane fermion at the @xmath2 is the order of the _ reduced _ cutoff scale that is warp suppressed from the fundamental scale .",
    "we also estimate the decay constant of the composite nambu - goldstone scalar field by using the pagels - stokar approximation .",
    "the decay constant is also warp suppressed on the @xmath2 brane in the rs brane world . if the chiral symmetry is gauged as in the sm case , the composite scalar absorbed in the longitudinal component of the gauge boson .",
    "this decay constant is directly related to the mass of the gauge boson .",
    "the result in the rs brane world provides a possibility to realize the situation that electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the condensation of the composite higgs field on the @xmath2 brane .",
    "such a mechanism is caused by the bulk yang - mills theory , for example the techni - color or the qcd itself in the sm .",
    "therefore we can solve the weak - planck hierarchy from the warp factor , that is realized , in a sense , dynamically .",
    "this is one of the dynamical realization of so called randall - sundrum model .",
    "our analyses are based on the 4d effective theory of the bulk gauge theory with an explicit uv cutoff in the loop momentum integration .",
    "we can also check the regularization dependence of our model by comparing the results of the lattice regularized ( deconstructed ) version .",
    "the deconstructed bulk field theory is given in @xcite on the rs background .",
    "the results of our analysis are also important in a theoretical sense .",
    "we consider that the sd equation includes certain non - perturbative effect of the theory .",
    "the non - trivial results obtained here implies that the bulk gauge theory may have rich non - perturbative dynamics that depends on the configurations of the extra space . in the brane world",
    "we should take account of such effect in addition to the perturbative analysis .",
    "our results imply that the bulk gauge dynamics can induce various types of the _ dynamical _ symmetry breaking in the brane world , depending on the bulk - brane configuration .",
    "for instance , we may obtain the dynamical breaking of the grand unification gauge symmetry @xcite ( or even supersymmetry ? ) , in addition to the possibility of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking emphasized in this paper .",
