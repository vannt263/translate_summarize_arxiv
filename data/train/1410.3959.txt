    "in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , a phase transition occurs from hadronic matter into a state of deconfined quarks and gluons  @xcite . properties of this latter state of matter , dubbed as the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) , have been a subject of extensive measurements at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in the past decade and a half . the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) program phase i.was dedicated to the search of turn - off signatures of the sqgp  @xcite . on the other hand , significantly improved luminosity of rhic in the recent years , paired with continuous detector development allows one to turn to rare probes , such as heavy flavor production , which are complementary to observables of light hadrons and provide us with a deeper understanding of the strong interaction .",
    "charm and bottom quarks are produced in hard qcd processes early in the interaction , and , due to their large masses , their number is virtually unaffected in the later stages of the reaction .",
    "heavy flavor quarks therefore provide a unique means of exploring the properties of the sqgp .",
    "open heavy flavor yields at different momenta are sensitive to the energy loss mechanism of partons .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy measurements may supply us with additional information about the degree of thermalization of the medium .",
    "quarkonium states are expected to be subject to sequential melting due to the screening of the @xmath7 potential in the sqgp , and provide access to thermodynamical properties of the medium  @xcite .",
    "production of charmonia is abundant and therefore it is relatively easy to measure them with precision .",
    "however , several effects concurrent to sequential melting , such as feed - down , recombination in the sqgp and co - mover absorption in the hadronic phase , influence measured yields  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between these effects can be understood by comprehensive measurements at different energies and in different colliding systems .",
    "bottomonium measurements are of special interest because , contrary to charm quarks , the effect of bottom pair recombination and co - mover absorption is negligible at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "the star detector at rhic is a compound experiment of several subsystems that provides a full azimuthal coverage at mid - rapidity ( @xmath8@xmath91 ) . in the analyses discussed below ,",
    "momentum measurement of charged particles , as well as particle identification based on energy loss via ionization , is done using the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",

    "the invariant yields are determined in the following way : the invariant mass peak is reconstructed from the decay products , the combinatorial background is subtracted using event mixing ( @xmath0 ) or swapped - sign background ( @xmath1 ) , and the residual background is removed with a sideband fit . the raw spectrum is then corrected for acceptance and efficiency .",
    "this method provides direct access to the kinematics of the charmed meson .",
    "however , such events are difficult to trigger on , and without secondary vertex detection capabilities , the combinatorial background level is high .",
    "the other way is to measure _ non - photonic electrons _ ( npe ) from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom  @xcite , eg.@xmath11@xmath12@xmath18 .",
    "such processes typically have branching ratios two times larger than hadronic channels , and high-@xmath10electrons are easily triggered on in the bemc using a _ high tower _",
