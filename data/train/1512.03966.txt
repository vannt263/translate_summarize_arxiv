    "the purpose of this article is to generalise lattice gauge theory from groups to hopf algebras .",
    "our motivation stems from a variety of gauge theory - like models constructed from algebraic data assigned to discretisations of oriented surfaces , many of which are based on hopf algebras , their representation categories or higher categorical analogues .",
    "examples of recent interest include models in condensed matter physics and quantum computation such as kitaev @xcite and lewin - wen models @xcite , as well as models in non - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "there are also older models obtained from canonical quantisation of chern - simons theory @xcite and much work on related models in 3d quantum gravity  for an overview see @xcite .",
    "these models strongly resemble lattice gauge theories , exhibiting gauge - like symmetries , topologically invariant subspaces of invariant states , and operators resembling wilson loops .",
    "some have been related @xcite to 3d topological field theories of turaev - viro @xcite or of reshetikhin - turaev type @xcite , which in turn arise from quantisation of bf and chern - simons gauge theories .",
    "however , while their gauge theoretic features and origins suggest viewing these models as hopf algebraic generalisations lattice gauge theory , no precise concept of lattice gauge theory valued in a hopf algebra has so far been available .",
    "neither the physical requirements nor the appropriate mathematical structures for such a theory are obvious . nor",
    "is it easy to conceptually unify the would - be examples of hopf algebra gauge theory , which are often formulated ad hoc for specific graphs , specific bases , generators or relations , and in language that obscures the general mathematical structures and their relation to classical gauge theoretic concepts such as gauge fields , connections , and observables . with few exceptions , e.g.  @xcite ,",
    "little work has sought to physically motivate the mathematical structures arising in such models .",
    "the goal of this article is to address these issues .",
    "we provide a robust and physically - motivated general definition of local hopf algebra gauge theory on a ribbon graph , construct such gauge theories , and relate them to established models arising from quantising chern  simons theory .",
    "we also clarify the gauge theoretic structure of these theories , including holonomy , curvature , and observables .    to achieve this",
    ", we mimic group - based gauge theory and its physical interpretation as closely as possible , linearising standard gauge theory concepts and generalising to accommodate hopf algebras not associated to a group . for gauge theory on a ribbon graph with edge set @xmath3 and vertex set @xmath4 , we can summarise the key ingredients of our definition of hopf algebra gauge theory ( def .",

    "most importantly , for a general hopf algebra , the algebra structure on @xmath7 is _ not _ the canonical one induced by the multiplication in @xmath8 , as one might naively expect from the group case , since this would not be compatible with ` gauge symmetry ' unless @xmath6 is cocommutative .",
    "rather , we must specify an algebra structure on @xmath7 that makes it a _ module algebra _ for the gauge action . physically speaking ,",
    "this amounts to the requirement that gauge invariant functions , or observables , should form a _",
    "subalgebra_.    it is also worth mentioning why a hopf algebra gauge theory requires _ ribbon graphs _ rather than ordinary graphs . even for groups ,",
    "ribbon graphs are natural for two - dimensional gauge theory , since embedding a graph in an oriented surface gives it a ribbon structure .",
    "however , for hopf algebras , this structure seems essential : if the algebra is non - cocommutative , we know of no sensible way to get gauge transformations to act on connections without assuming a ribbon structure on our graphs .",
    "we thus work with ribbon graphs throughout the article , reviewing their structure in section [ sec : background ] .",
    "while our definition of hopf algebra gauge theory is built up axiomatically , guided but the group case , our main results in support of the quality of this definition are that we can build up hopf algebra gauge theories from local data , show topological invariance of their algebras of observables , relate these algebras to existing work , and thus clarify the gauge - theoretic foundations of other models . here",
    "we outline these main results .      by a _",
    "vertex neighbourhood _",
    ", we simply mean a cyclically - ordered directed rooted tree of height one : @xmath9{vertex - nbhd.pdf}\\ ] ] but our terminology emphasises that we think of these as obtained from a larger graph by cutting all of the edges surrounding a single vertex , and gluing new vertices to the loose ends . studying hopf algebra gauge theory on such simple graphs (  [ subsec : vertex_nb ] ) shows that allowing non - cocommutativity strongly constrains our choice of gauge hopf algebra @xmath6 .",
    "however , we show that these constraints can be satisfied  and in an essentially unique way determined by the ` locality conditions ' in our definition  provided we take the hopf algebra to be _",
    "quasitriangular_. moreover ,",
    "considering consistency with reversing the orientation of edges leads us to demand that our hopf algebra has a _ ribbon _ element .",
    "* theorem 1 : * a hopf algebra gauge theory on a vertex neighbourhood is essentially unique .",
    "the relevant @xmath6-module algebra structure on @xmath10 is related to the braided tensor product of @xmath6-module algebras and dual to a two - sided twist deformation of @xmath10 with a cocycle involving multiple copies of its universal @xmath11-matrix .",
    "this result , found in  [ subsec : gribbongraph ] , means hopf algebra gauge theory can be built up from local data , effectively reducing the construction of gauge theory for any ribbon graph to basic building blocks constructed on the vertex neighbourhoods .    to show this",
    ", we split a ribbon graph into a disjoint union of vertex neighbourhoods and use comultiplication to embed the copy of @xmath8 associated with a directed edge @xmath12 in the original graph into the two copies of @xmath8 associated with the two _ ends _ of @xmath12 , each associated with a vertex neighbourhood :    @xmath13{gluing.pdf } } ; \\node { $ \\to$ } ; \\node at ( -3.25,.25 ) { $ k^*$ } ; \\node at ( 2.6,.25 ) { $ k^*$ } ; \\node at ( 3.75,.25 ) { $ k^*$ } ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] doing this simultaneously for all edges in the ribbon graph yields an injective linear map @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the algebra of functions for the vertex neighbourhood at @xmath16 .",
    "* theorem 2 : * the image of @xmath17 is a subalgebra and a @xmath18-submodule of @xmath19 . pulling back this structure makes @xmath20 into the algebra of functions for a hopf algebra gauge theory .",
    "this algebra is analysed in  [ subsec : algfunc ] for concrete graphs ; for a single loop it is related to @xmath21 , and when @xmath22 is a drinfeld double of a hopf algebra @xmath23 , the algebra for a single edge between distinct vertices is isomorphic to the _ heisenberg double _ of @xmath23 .      in analogy to group gauge theory , we view holonomy as a functor @xmath24 that assigns to each path in @xmath25a morphism in the _ path groupoid _ @xmath26a linear map @xmath27 taking connections on @xmath25 to element of the hopf algebra @xmath6 .    for this , the vector space @xmath28 is given the structure of a category with one object and with composition built from multiplication in @xmath6 and comultiplication in @xmath29 . in principle , there are two choices of coalgebra structure on @xmath29 , coming either from the tensor product hopf algebra structure or from the multiplication in the algebra of functions .",
    "however , we show in  [ subsec : genhols ] that only the former gives rise to a holonomy functor in the strict sense , and only under the additional assumption that @xmath6 is _",
    "semisimple_. we also investigate the algebraic properties of the holonomies in  [ subsec : algprop ] and derive a general formula for the transformation of holonomies under graph operations and show that , for each path in @xmath25 that represents a simple curve on the associated surface , the holonomies form a subalgebra and a submodule of the algebra of functions of the hopf algebra gauge theory .",
    "there is a well - known way of viewing any ribbon graph , defined by combinatorial data , as a surface with boundary , unique up to homeomorphism .",
    "this is achieved by fattening out edges into ` ribbons ' , as the name suggests , and vertices into discs , or equivalently by gluing annuli along edges according to the combinatorial data",
    ". moreover , ribbon graphs that induce the same surface with boundary are related by certain graph operations , reviewed in  [ subsec : graphopsribbon ] . in section [ sec :",
    "graphops ] , we show that these graph operations induce isomorphisms of hopf algebra gauge theories  in particular , the algebras of functions and of observables depend on the choice of the ribbon graph only insofar as the ribbon graphs induce homeomorphic surfaces in this way .",
    "* theorem 3 : * if two ribbon graphs induce homeomorphic surfaces with boundary , then the algebras of observables of the associated @xmath6-valued hopf algebra gauge theories are isomorphic .      aside from viewing a ribbon graph as a surface with boundary , there is also a well - known way of viewing any ribbon graph as a _ closed _",
    "surface , by attaching discs , rather than annuli . by considering holonomies around these discs ",
    "faces in the resulting cw complex  we arrive at a notion of curvature in hopf algebra gauge theory .",
    "we show the curvature at a face defines a central element of the algebra of observables .",
    "we show that if @xmath6 is semisimple , the haar integral of @xmath8 gives rise to a set of commuting projectors associated with faces , whose image can be viewed as the algebra of observables on the set of _ flat _ connections .    * theorem 4 : * if two ribbon graphs induce homeomorphic closed surfaces , then their associated algebras of observables on flat connections are isomorphic .",
    "we prove that the algebra of functions obtained from our definition of hopf algebra gauge theory and the associated subalgebras of all observables and of observables on flat connections coincide with the algebras obtained by alekseev , grosse and schomerus @xcite and independently by buffenoir and roche @xcite in the canonical quantisation of chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "the description of this algebra was refined further in @xcite , where the authors developed a description that is suitable for concrete computations and naturally fits into the framework of quantum topology . in particular , the algebra of observables , the algebra of observables on flat connections and the results of theorems 3 and 4 above constitute a generalisation and simplification of topological invariance results obtained earlier @xcite in a different framework and by different methods .",
    "while the algebras themselves are thus not new , our approach adds several insights to the picture .",
    "first , the algebras were previously obtained by quantising the poisson structures in @xcite by canonical quantisation , i.e.  replacing classical @xmath30-matrices by @xmath11-matrices and poisson brackets by multiplication relations . while physically well - motivated , this leaves questions about uniqueness of the quantisation procedure and of the resulting algebra , especially since the underlying poisson structure is non - canonical .",
    "our approach addresses this by showing that the algebra can be _ derived _ from simple axioms for a local hopf algebra gauge theory in an essentially unique way .",
    "second , our formulation exhibits more clearly the essential mathematical ingredients , namely , module algebras over hopf algebras and their braided tensor products .",
    "these are physically motivated by the requirement that the gauge invariant observables form an algebra .",
    "the resulting description is close to the viewpoint of non - commutative geometry , in which a commutative algebra of classical coordinate functions is deformed or replaced by a non - commutative analogue .",
    "moreover , these algebras are shown to be built up atomically from the algebras on vertex neighbourhoods , which are obtained from a two - sided twist - deformation of a hopf algebra @xmath31 .",
    "this reflects the local nature of the hopf algebra gauge theory and allows one to construct hopf algebra gauge theory on a surface by gluing discs around the vertices of a graph .",
    "( a similar decomposition was also given in @xcite , but in a diagrammatic formulation .",
    "this has computational advantages , but makes it difficult to interpret the results from a gauge theory perspective . )",
    "this decomposition into vertex neighbourhoods leads to a direct and simple description of local hopf algebra gauge theory .",
    "while the formulation in @xcite is highly involved and relies on specific choices of a basis of @xmath6 , namely matrix elements in the irreducible representations , clebsch - gordan coefficients and intertwiners and mainly considers a fixed ribbon graph , the description in terms of vertex neighbourhoods allows one to give a coordinate free description for general ribbon graphs . in this description ,",
    "the proof of topological invariance is much simpler and more direct .",
    "moreover , the concept of holonomy arises in a more conceptual way , as a functor , and holonomies transform by simple and explicit rules under graph transformations",
    ". this may also be helpful in generalising hopf algebra gauge theory to include defects .",
    "section [ sec : background ] provides background material on graphs and their path categories (  [ subsec : graphs ] ) and ribbon graphs (  [ subsec : ribbongraph ] ) as well as describing the operations on ribbon graphs (  [ subsec : graphopsribbon ] ) that leave preserve the topology of the resulting surfaces .    in section [ sec : gtheory ]",
