    "recently many three - body @xmath0 decay modes , for example , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , have been observed at @xmath0 factories with branching ratios of order @xmath21 .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis of 3-body @xmath0 decays provides a nice methodology for extracting information on the unitarity triangle in the standard model .",
    "the three - body meson decays are generally dominated by intermediate vector and scalar resonances , namely , they proceed via quasi - two - body decays containing a resonance state and a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "indeed , most of the quasi - two @xmath0 decays are extracted from the analysis of three - body @xmath0 decays using the dalitz plot technique .",
    "three - body hadronic @xmath0 decays involving a vector meson or charmed meson also have been observed at @xmath0 factories . in this talk",
    "i ll focus on charmless 3-body @xmath0 decays .",
    "experimentally , there are two striking features for 3-body hadronic @xmath0 decays :    @lcc@ decay & babar & belle + @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 + @xmath25 & @xmath26 & + @xmath27 & & @xmath28 + @xmath6 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 + @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 + @xmath34 & @xmath35 & +    [ tab : brexpt ]    0.2 cm ( i ) large noresonant fractions in peguin - dominated modes 0.2 cm it is known that the nonresonant signal in charm decays is small , less than 10% @xcite . in the past few years , some of the charmless @xmath0 to 3-body decay modes",
    "have been measured at @xmath0 factories and studied using the dalitz plot analysis .",
    "we see from table [ tab : brexpt ] that the nonresonant fraction is about @xmath36 90% in @xmath2 decays , @xmath37 in @xmath38 decays ( smaller in the @xmath39 decay ) , and @xmath36 14% in the @xmath40 decay .",
    "hence , the nonresonant 3-body decays play an essential role in penguin - dominated @xmath0 decays .",
    "while this is a surprise in view of the rather small nonresonant contributions in 3-body charm decays , it is not entirely unexpected because the energy release scale in weak @xmath0 decays is of order 5 gev , whereas the major resonances lie in the energy region of 0.77 to 1.6 gev . consequently , it is likely that 3-body @xmath0 decays may receive sizable nonresonant contributions .",
    "it is important to understand and identify the underlying mechanism for nonresonant decays .",
    "nonresonant amplitudes in charm decays are usually assumed to be uniform in phase space .",
    "however , this is no longer true in @xmath0 decays due to the large energy release in weak @xmath0 decays . while both babar and belle have adopted the parametrization @xmath41 to describe the non - resonant @xmath2 amplitudes , they differ in the analysis of the nonresonant component in @xmath38 decays .",
    "belle still employed the above exponential parametrization to analyze the nonresonant contribution , but babar used the lass parametrization to describe the @xmath42 @xmath43-wave and the nonresonant component by a single amplitude suggested by the lass collaboration to describe the scalar amplitude in elastic @xmath42 scattering . since the babar and belle definitions of the @xmath44 and nonresonant differ , the branching fractions and phases are not directly comparable",
    ". we will come this point more in sec .",
    "experimentally , it is hard to measure the direct 3-body decays as the interference between nonresonant and quasi - two - body amplitudes makes it difficult to disentangle these two distinct contributions and extract the nonresonant one .",
    "0.2 cm ( ii ) new broad scalar resonances @xmath45 and @xmath46 0.2 cm    a broad scalar resonance @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 denoted by babar ) has been seen in @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 decays at energies around 1.5 gev .",
    "however , it can not be identified with the well known scaler meson @xmath52 .",
    "this is because @xmath52 decays into @xmath53 about five times more frequently than to @xmath54 .",
    "identification of @xmath47 with @xmath52 will imply that the @xmath54 peak at 1.5 gev will be accompanied by a peak in @xmath53 , which is not seen experimentally .",
    "hence , the nature of @xmath47 is not clear .",
    "moreover , there exists a production puzzle for @xmath47 . both babar and belle",
    "have seen a large fraction from @xmath47 in the decay @xmath22 : @xmath55 by babar @xcite and @xmath56 by belle @xcite , whereas it is only about 4% seen by babar in @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the puzzle is that why @xmath47 behaves so dramatically different in charged and neutral @xmath0 decays to 3 kaons .",
    "it is not clear whether the large production of @xmath47 is a genuine effect or just a statistical fluctuation .",
    "anyway , this issue should be clarified soon .",
    "notice that belle actually found two solutions for the fraction of @xmath58 in @xmath59 @xcite : @xmath56 and @xmath60 .",
    "the first solution is preferred by belle .",
    "it is probably worth of re - examining the small solution .",
    "in analog to two - body decays of heavy mesons which can be analyzed using the model - independent quark diagrammatic approach , three - body decays of the heavy mesons can be expressed in terms of some quark - graph amplitudes @xcite ( see fig . [ qd ] ) : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the color - allowed external @xmath63-emission tree diagrams ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the color - suppressed internal @xmath63-emission diagrams ; @xmath66 , the @xmath63-exchange diagram ; @xmath67 , the @xmath63-annihilation diagram ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the penguin diagrams , and @xmath70 , the penguin - induced annihilation diagram .",
    "the quark - graph amplitudes of various 3-body @xmath0 decays @xmath71 and @xmath72 are summarized in table i of @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite , the use of the quark - diagram amplitudes for three - body decays are in general momentum dependent .",
    "this means that unless its momentum dependence is known , the quark - diagram amplitudes of direct 3-body decays can not be extracted from experiment without making further assumptions .",
    "moreover , the momentum dependence of each quark - diagram amplitude varies from channel to channel .     denotes a heavy quark.,width=215 ]",
    "we take the decay @xmath25 as an illustration . under the factorization approach ,",
    "its decay amplitude consists of three distinct factorizable terms : ( i ) the transition process induced by @xmath73 penguins , @xmath74 , ( ii ) the current - induced process through the tree @xmath75 transition , @xmath76 , and ( iii ) the annihilation process @xmath77 , where @xmath78 denotes a @xmath79 transition matrix element .      for the transition process , the general expression of the nonresonant contribution has the form @xmath80 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 . in principle",
    ", one can apply heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hmchpt ) to evaluate the form factors @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( for previous studies , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this will lead to too large decay rates in disagreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation indicates that the branching ratio of @xmath25 arising from the transition process alone is already at the level of @xmath84 which exceeds the measured total branching ratio @xcite of @xmath85 .",
    "the issue has to do with the applicability of hmchpt . in order to apply this approach , two of the final - state pseudoscalars (",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 in this example ) have to be soft .",
    "the momentum of the soft pseudoscalar should be smaller than the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath88 of order @xmath89 gev .",
    "for 3-body charmless @xmath0 decays , the available phase space where chiral perturbation theory is applicable is only a small fraction of the whole dalitz plot .",
    "therefore , it is not justified to apply chiral and heavy quark symmetries to a certain kinematic region and then generalize it to the region beyond its validity . if the soft meson result is assumed to be the same in the whole dalitz plot , the decay rate will be greatly overestimated .",
    "recently we have proposed to parametrize the @xmath75 trasnition - induced nonresonant amplitude given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ahmchpt ] ) as @xcite @xmath90 so that the hmchpt results are recovered in the chiral limit @xmath91 .",
    "that is , the nonresonant amplitude in the soft meson region is described by hmchpt , but its energy dependence beyond the chiral limit is governed by the exponential term @xmath92 .",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath93 can be determined from the data of the tree - dominated decay @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath75 tree transition , we need to consider the nonresonant contributions to the @xmath73 penguin amplitude @xmath94 the 2-kaon creation matrix elements can be expressed in terms of time - like kaon current form factors as @xmath95 the weak vector form factors @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be related to the kaon electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "form factors @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the charged and neutral kaons , respectively .",
    "phenomenologically , the e.m .",
    "form factors receive resonant and nonresonant contributions @xmath100 the resonant and nonresonant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kkemff ] ) can be determined from a fit to the kaon e.m .",
    "the non - resonant contribution to the matrix element @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 the nonresonant @xmath103 term is introduced for the following reason . although the nonresonant contributions to @xmath104 and @xmath105 are related through the equation of motion , the resonant ones are different and not related _ a priori_. as stressed in @xcite , to apply the equation of motion , the form factors should be away from the resonant region . in the presence of the resonances , we thus need to introduce a nonresonant @xmath103 term which can be constrained by the measured @xmath106 rate and the @xmath54 mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "vector meson and scalar resonances contribute to the two - body matrix elements @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "they can also contribute to the three - body matrix element @xmath109 .",
    "resonant effects are described in terms of the usual breit - wigner formalism .",
    "more precisely , @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in this manner we are able to figure out the relevant resonances which contribute to the 3-body decays of interest and compute the rates of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "our calculation indicates the deviation of the mixing - induced @xmath9 asymmetry in @xmath119 from that measured in @xmath120 is very similar to that of the @xmath114 mode as the tree pollution effect in the former is somewhat washed out .",
    "nevertheless , direct @xmath9 asymmetry of the former , being of order @xmath121 , is more prominent than the latter .",
    "it is important to account for the large nonresonant amplitudes in the study of charmless 3-body baryonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "we have identified two distinct sources of nonresonant contributions : a small contribution from the tree transition and a large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix elements of scalar densities , e.g. @xmath1 , induced from the penguin transition .",
    "this explains the dominance of the nonresonant background in @xmath2 decays , the sizable nonresonant fraction in @xmath3 and @xmath4 modes and the smallness of nonresonant rates in @xmath5 decays .",
    "the seemingly huge discrepancy between babar and belle for the nonresonant contribution in the decay @xmath6 is now relieved . since penguin contributions to charm decays",
    "are gim suppressed , hence nonresonant signals in @xmath122 decays are always small .    we have computed the resonant and nonresonant contributions to charmless 3-body decays and determined the rates for the quasi - two - body decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
