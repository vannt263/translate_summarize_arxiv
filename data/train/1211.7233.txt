    "many natural and industrial processes involve the reaction or collision of diffusing species transported by an outer flow .",
    "such systems are typically modeled in terms of the _ reaction - diffusion - advection _ equation for the density field @xmath2 . in the simple case of the pair - annihilation reaction @xmath3 , where two molecules react together to become inert",
    ", this kinetic equation takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the diffusion constant , @xmath6 the velocity of the outer flow , and @xmath7 the reaction rate . an important aspect withheld in such an approach",
    "is the assumed relation between the microscopic stochastic rate , that is the probability that two given individual molecules react , and the mesoscopic reaction propensity , that is the number of reactions per unit time and volume written here as @xmath8 . to derive one",
    "must assume two properties to be satisfied at the coarse - graining scale from which the hydrodynamic limit is taken @xcite .",
    "first , volumes at the coarse - graining scale have to contain sufficiently many particles , in order to safely disregard finite - number fluctuations .",
    "second , each particle within this volume must have an equal probability to react with all the others  _ well - mixing _ hypothesis .",
    "for this second condition to be satisfied , the coarse - graining scale has to be sufficiently small , i.e.  smaller than the interaction distance between particle pairs .",
    "it is clear that in situations where the reactants are very dilute , the two conditions underlying might not be simultaneously satisfied . in particular",
    ", fluctuations due to a finite number of reactants might be so important to invalidate the mean - field assumptions leading to .",
    "much work has been devoted to model and study such fluctuations in situations where transport is negligible and diffusion dominates .",
    "it was shown that finite - number effects can be taken into account by adding an imaginary noise in the reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "the time evolution of statistical quantities is then obtained by averaging with respect to this noise ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "two equivalent approaches were independently developed using either the poisson representation  @xcite or a field - theoretical description  @xcite . in both cases , it is assumed that a reaction takes place with a given rate when two particles are on the same node of a lattice .",
    "diffusion is then modeled by a random walk .",
    "after that , the hydrodynamic limit is obtained by performing the limit of vanishing lattice spacing . such approaches , which were developed for diffusion - limited reactions ,",
    "can not be straightforwardly extended to cases where transport can not be neglected .    in many natural situations , the dynamics of",
    "very dilute reacting species is dominated by ( possibly compressible ) advection and their diffusion is almost negligible .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , of dust grains growing by accretion to form planets in the early solar system  @xcite or of phytoplankton confined in a two - dimensional ocean layers  @xcite .",
    "also , motile microorganisms in aquatic environments can detach from the fluid trajectories thanks to swimming and behave as tracers in a weakly - compressible flow @xcite . because of the large sizes of the transported species , molecular diffusion is negligible in all aforementioned examples .",
    "another instance concerns the initiation of rain in warm clouds .",
    "droplets , which are typically occupying a volume fraction of the order of @xmath9 , grow by coalescence to form raindrops . because of their finite size and mass , such droplets have inertia and their dynamics decouples from the flow .",
    "when they are sufficiently small , droplets behave as tracers in an effective compressible flow that depends on the local turbulence of the carrier airflow  @xcite .",
    "this leads to strong and violent fluctuations both in their local spatial concentration  @xcite and in the rate at which they collide  @xcite .",
    "classical approaches consist in using the ( mean - field ) smoluchowski coagulation equation , which is a generalization of the kinetic equation   to the case of a full population with a size distribution  @xcite .",
    "many questions remain open on the statistical effects of turbulence on the timescales at which rain is formed  @xcite . in addition",
    "very little is known on the finite - number fluctuations induced by diluteness that might also play an important role in assessing the average growth rate of droplets .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop a general framework which can be used to address such issues .",
    "for that , we neglect diffusion and focus on particles transported by generic compressible flows . also , we focus on the annihilation reaction @xmath10 because we expect that this simple model will capture the essence of finite - number effects in advection - reaction systems .",
    "it is clear that , at long times , the particle number density decreases , so that this long - term asymptotics is very likely affected by finite - number effects .",
    "kinetic approaches using predict that , ultimately , the average number of particles decays algebraically as @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this behavior , which occurs at times much longer than the fluid velocity correlation time , can be explained in terms of an effective eddy diffusion .",
    "the flow compressibility might decrease the effective diffusivity  @xcite , but the latter remains anyway positive  @xcite .",
    "hence , at long times , the spatial fluctuations of the concentration are smoothed out and a closed equation can be written for the spatial average of @xmath2 . here",
    ", we find that finite - number effects enhance the long - time decay of the average number of particles .",
    "for that we consider discrete particles that are tracers of the compressible fluid flow and that annihilate with a rate @xmath12 when they are separated by less than an interaction distance @xmath13 .",
    "we show that the average number of particles does not decrease algebraically but rather exponentially as @xmath14 .",
    "this law pertains to the statistics of the relative motion between two reactants and the exponential decay rate @xmath15 depends on both the microscopic rate @xmath12 and the flow statistical properties in a non - trivial manner .",
    "the main result of this work is the introduction of a novel lagrangian approach in terms of non - reacting particle trajectories .",
    "we exploit these ideas to express @xmath15 using a large - deviation principle for the time that two tracers spend at a distance below the radius of interaction @xmath13 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : master ] contains basic definitions and set the general framework of this work .",
    "the @xmath1-point number - density field is introduced and is shown to obey a hierarchy of transport equations . when integrated over space , these fields correspond to the factorial moments of the number of particles that are present in the system .",
    "we then briefly discuss the zero - dimensional case and its relationship with standard studies of finite - number effects in well - mixed settings . in section [ sec : lagrange ] , the hierarchy for the @xmath1-point number - density is solved by using a lagrangian approach that consists in following the flow characteristics . at long times",
    "the particle number moments are shown to decay exponentially with a rate @xmath15 that does not depend on their order .",
    "an analytic expression for @xmath15 is given in terms of the lagrangian statistics of ( non - reacting ) tracer trajectories . in section [ sec:2point ]",
    "we focus on the relevant case of two particles .",
    "the exponential decay rate is then related to the time spent by the pair at a distance less than the interaction radius and is expressed in terms of the large fluctuations of the latter .",
    "asymptotic arguments and a phenomenological picture valid for generic flows are then developed to relate the decay rate @xmath15 to the _ microscopic _ rate @xmath12 .",
    "section [ sec : dilute_kraich ] contains an application to very dilute suspensions in smooth compressible gaussian delta - correlated - in - time flows ( belonging to the so - called _ kraichnan ensemble _ ; see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) for which the effective reaction rate can be analytically derived .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] presents some concluding remarks and open questions .",
    "we consider a set of particles @xmath16 whose positions @xmath17 obey the equations @xmath18 where @xmath6 is a prescribed @xmath19-dimensional differentiable velocity field with given isotropic , stationary , and homogeneous statistics .",
    "the velocity field @xmath6 is assumed to have a finite correlation time and might be compressible with _",
    "@xmath20 where the over line designates the average with respect to the velocity field realizations , and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the extremal values @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to incompressible and purely potential velocity fields , respectively .",
    "whenever @xmath24 , the dynamical system defined by is dissipative . also , to maintain sufficiently generic settings , the dynamics is assumed ergodic and chaotic",
    "typically , when the flow is defined on a compact set , the trajectories generated by will concentrate on a dynamically evolving strange attractor , while in the incompressible limit they remain uniformly distributed ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details on particle transport in compressible and incompressible flows ) . for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we will focus on the dynamics of tracers given by .",
    "however , the results can be straightforwardly extended to a general dynamics given by the newton equation @xmath25 as that ruling , for instance , the evolution of inertial particles @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is supplemented by binary reactions between the particles .",
    "when @xmath26 the particles labeled @xmath27 and @xmath28 might react and annihilate ( or become inert ) .",
    "this happens with a rate @xmath12 . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of particles @xmath29 in the domain will decrease from its initial value @xmath30 in the course of time .",
    "we suppose that the radius of interaction @xmath13 is smaller than the scale at which @xmath6 varies .",
    "for example , in turbulent flows , this corresponds to assuming that @xmath13 is smaller than the kolmogorov length scale @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , in writing we have neglected particle diffusion .",
    "this is justified whenever the interaction distance @xmath13 is larger than the batchelor length scale @xmath32 , where @xmath33 designates the schmidt number  that is the ratio between the fluid kinematic viscosity @xmath34 and the particle diffusivity @xmath5 . for applications",
    ", our settings thus reduce to very large values of the schmidt number .",
    "we notice that the schmidt number can be of the order of thousands or higher in organic mixtures , biological fluids and generically for particulate matter .",
    "estimates based on stokes ",
    "einstein relation lead for a micro - meter sized spherical particle @xmath35 in air and @xmath36 in water .    before discussing the master equations which describe the system",
    ", it is worth underlining that our settings involve different sources of stochasticity .",
    "first , the dynamics has to be supplemented by initial conditions on particle positions that we choose randomly .",
    "a second source of randomness comes from the intrinsic stochasticity of the reaction process . finally , the fluid flow is stochastic with prescribed statistics .",
    "consequently , ensemble averages corresponding to these different sources of randomness must be considered ; the corresponding notations will be introduced when needed .",
    "to fully describe all interactions between the particles in the considered system , all relative positions are simultaneously needed .",
    "it is then natural to define for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 being the initial number of particles ) the joint @xmath1-point number density @xmath39 where the brackets @xmath40 stands for the ensemble average with respect to reactions only and , by convention , the sum in is zero when @xmath41 .",
    "the particle indices @xmath42 vary between @xmath43 and the number @xmath29 of particles in each realization of the reactions .",
    "the sum is not ordered so that , by construction , the spatial averages of the @xmath44 s are the factorial moments of the total number of particles , namely @xmath45 hence , @xmath46 is the average number of @xmath1-uplets among the @xmath29 particles still present at time @xmath47 .    taking into account the transport by the flow @xmath6 and the reactions , the joint @xmath1-point densities satisfy the following hierarchy of equations @xmath48 & = & -\\mu\\ ,    { \\mathcal{f}}_n\\,\\sum_{i < j}\\theta(a-|{\\vec{x}}_i-{\\vec{x}}_j| ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !    -\\mu",

    "the transport term comes from the identity @xmath52.\\ ] ] the two terms in the right - hand side are sinks accounting for the reactions : the first includes all binary reactions between any close - enough pair among the @xmath1 considered particles ; the second counts the reactions of any of these @xmath1 particles with another one at a distance smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "the hierarchy for the @xmath1-point joint number density is exact and contains all information about the dynamics and statistics of the system .",
    "moreover , it is closed at the order @xmath53 and can be integrated by the method of characteristics ( see sect .  [ sec : lagrange ] ) . in the next subsection",
    "we relate this description in terms of factorial moments to standard descriptions used in the statistical physics of well - mixed chemical reactions .",
    "when the hypothesis of _ well - mixedness _ is satisfied , as when for instance the interaction radius is larger than the system size , transport does not play any role in the temporal evolution of the factorial moments @xmath54 . in this zero - dimensional limit",
    ", the hierarchy of transport equations becomes a simpler hierarchy of ordinary differential equations , i.e. @xmath55 which can be also derived from the standard master equation describing the reaction @xmath56 .",
    "denoting with @xmath57 the probability of having @xmath58 particles at time @xmath47 , we have @xcite @xmath59 by definition , the factorial moments are expressed in terms of @xmath57 as @xmath60 taking the time derivative of @xmath61 and using yields to .",
    "equation   is generally the starting point for describing the statistics of chemical reactions . in the limit of large number of particles",
    ", the mean - field approximation @xmath62 is often used to write from a closed equation for the mean number of particles .",
    "this mean - field equation , obtained by replacing @xmath63 by @xmath64 in for @xmath65 , predicts a @xmath11 algebraic decay of the number of particles .",
    "clearly , the mean - field approximation will breakdown at long times when the number of particles is smaller .",
    "many works have been devoted to describe fluctuations and deviations from mean field due to a finite number of particles @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is possible to show that solving equation is equivalent to computing the moments of the solution of a stochastic differential equation with a pure imaginary noise  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach can not be directly applied when the interaction radius is finite and transport is present .",
    "reactions and spatial location of particles can not be treated separately as it is usually done in reaction - diffusion systems , where the _ well - mixed _",
    "hypothesis is assumed at the scale of the lattice spacing .",
    "the hierarchy of transport equations naturally couples the spatial distribution of particles and the reactions .",
    "the aim of the next section is to provide a formal solution of in terms of lagrangian trajectories ( or tracers ) of the carrier flow .",
    "these trajectories are completely defined by carrier flow and do not depend on the reactions .",
    "we now consider a finite interaction distance so that the presence of transport by the flow must be explicitly accounted for . without loss of generality , we can assume that at @xmath66 the total number of particles is fixed and equal to @xmath67 . as @xmath68 for all @xmath69 , the hierarchy is closed at the order @xmath67 and can be integrated .",

    "we have implicitly assumed the existence and uniqueness of the lagrangian trajectories and each trajectory is labeled by its initial position .",
    "this assumption is guaranteed as we have considered a smooth velocity field . for a fully turbulent flow and",
    "if @xmath13 is much larger than the kolmogorov length scale , the velocity field is no longer smooth but only hlder continuous with an exponent smaller than one .",
    "in such a case the solutions to are not unique and the deterministic lagrangian flow breaks down . however , a statistical description of lagrangian trajectories is still possible @xcite .",
    "we conclude this subsection by noticing that this new approach in terms of lagrangian trajectories allows us to directly apply known results from passive ( non - reacting ) transport ( see @xcite for a review ) to address the problem of advection - reaction .",
    "these theoretical considerations will be mostly used in sect .",
    "[ sec:2point ] .",
    "when considering very dilute systems and small interaction radii , the hierarchy of transport equations can be closed at each order as the second term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "can be neglected with respect to the first one . in particular , the closure becomes exact in the long time limit when the mean number of particles depends only on the statistics of the relative distance of one pair of lagrangian trajectories .",
    "the long time behavior of the joint @xmath1-point density can be directly obtained from equation . noticing that @xmath84 , at the leading order , the joint @xmath1-point density is given for @xmath85 by @xmath86 integrating over all spatial variables , for @xmath85 , we obtain @xmath87 where now the average is over all possible @xmath1-uplets of tracers .",
    "finally , averaging the factorial moments over the realizations of the velocity field , we can define the effective reaction rate as @xmath88 note that the average over different realizations of the carrier flow , denoted with an overline , is performed before taking the logarithm .",
    "this important point will be further discussed in sect .",
    "[ subsec : effective ] .    in the zero - dimensional limit , by definition",
    "the heaviside function inside equation is equal to one , and thus the effective rate is simply given by @xmath89 , as confirmed by numerical data ( not shown ) .",
    "when the system is not well - mixed at all scales , the effective rate can not be computed for generic flows as multi - time and space correlations of lagrangian trajectories are involved .",
    "however , an important role is played by the case @xmath90 that only depends on the two - point motion .",
    "indeed , it is easy to check from equation that @xmath91 is an increasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the moments of the number of particles can be expressed as a linear combination of the factorial moments .",
    "the rate @xmath92 is thus always the leading exponent and for all @xmath93 we have @xmath94 this exponential decrease is expected to be valid at long times regardless of the initial number @xmath67 of particles considered .",
    "this behavior is evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom_fn_time ] where the temporal evolution of the moments @xmath95 is displayed for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and different orders @xmath98 . for @xmath99 ,",

    "also , due to the compressible transport , strong inhomogeneities appear in the particle spatial distribution , changing the local effective reaction rate .",

    "developing such theoretical tools is important not only for the reaction - advection problem but also for general questions associated with particle transport .",
    "another issue that was not addressed in this work , corresponds to the case when the velocity flow is not smooth enough to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the lagrangian trajectories .",
    "this is for example , the case of turbulent flows when the interaction radius is greater than the kolmogorov length scale . in such cases ,",
    "even if the solution in terms of tracers could be in principle extended by using the statistical description of the so - called generalized lagrangian flow @xcite , many of the theoretical considerations can drastically change .",
    "for instance , in these situations the relative dispersion of particles is very different from the brownian - motion - with - drift lognormal description used in this work .",
    "another topic , not covered by this work , concerns events related to the right - hand side of the rate function , which corresponds to the rare situations where particles stay close for times much larger than the average .",
    "this is relevant for instance when considering the probability that particles react very fast , a situation that can lead to underestimating the amount of reactants needed in some practical applications .",
    "finally , a natural extension of this work is to consider more general reactions . in particular",
    ", the case of coalescence / coagulation in dilute media presents many relevant applications to different fields , such as astrophysics or geosciences .",
    "note that an alternative approach to that given by the lagrangian trajectories consists in trying to close the hierarchy of transport equations by performing an appropriate coarse - graining .",
