    "in recent years large effort has been directed toward a lattice qcd calculation of the decay constant of heavy - light mesons .",
    "uncertainties in the results , however , are still quite large@xcite . in the static approximation for heavy quarks",
    ", the problem manifests in the presence of large noise in the correlators , which makes it difficult to extract ground state signals .",
    "smearing techniques have not resolved the problem , failing to yield results independent of the smearing size@xcite .    in this work",
    "we report on a calculation of heavy - light decay constants using non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite .",
    "our motivation stems from the expectation that noise in correlators should be reduced for a finite heavy quark mass@xcite and hence cleaner results could be obtained in nrqcd .",
    "in addition nrqcd allows incorporation of @xmath5 corrections in a systematic way .",
    "this is an important point since available results indicate that @xmath6 corrections to the static limit is fairly large for the @xmath2 meson@xcite .",
    "for the heavy quark we employ the standard nrqcd action given by@xcite @xmath7 q_{x t}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the latter being a modified choice in order to stabilize high frequency modes for @xmath10 . the spin - magnetic interaction term is included for keeping consistency of the @xmath6 expansion .",
    "we use the tree - level value @xmath11 for the coefficient .",
    "our simulation is carried out with 40 quenched configurations on an @xmath12 lattice at @xmath13 .",
    "the heavy quark masses used are @xmath14 with the @xmath15 action and @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the value @xmath18 is taken to compare with the results of the static approximation . for the light quark we used the wilson action with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the critical hopping parameter is @xmath22 .",
    "the heavy - light meson decay constant is extracted from the correlator of the axial - vector current and the heavy - light meson in the standard manner . for the meson operator we use the local form and also employ the cube smearing of sizes",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , fixing gauge configurations to the coulomb gauge to avoid the necessity of inserting gauge link factors .",
    "in fig .  [ figone ] we show the effective mass of the local - local correlation function @xmath27 for @xmath28=@xmath29 and 5.0 .",
    "clearly the signal is far better for @xmath28=5.0 for which we observe a plateau beyond @xmath30 .",
    "the improvement of ground state signals for smaller values of @xmath31 can be qualitatively understood from the estimate of the relative error@xcite , @xmath32\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are binding energies of heavy - light and heavy - heavy mesons . for finite @xmath31",
    "the negative contribution of @xmath34 reduces the value of the exponential slope from that in the static limit where @xmath34 vanishes .",
    "we found that our data for @xmath35 are consistent with this estimate .",
    "typical examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] where solid lines indicate the slope expected from the measured values of the binding energies and @xmath36 .      in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] we plot the raw value of the combination @xmath37 of the decay constant @xmath38 and the heavy - light meson mass @xmath39 extracted from fits of the correlators over the interval @xmath40 for various smearing sizes . for each group of data points",
    "@xmath41 increases as @xmath42 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 from left to right .",
    "we observe that the estimates converge to the same value after @xmath43 for all the smearing sizes including the case of no smearing .",
    "this gives us confidence that the asymptotic region is really reached at @xmath30 .",
    "we also note that the magnitude of errors are similar for various smearing sizes .",
    "in particular reliable results can be obtained without smearing in nrqcd . in the following analysis we use the cube smearing of size @xmath24 and extract @xmath37 from a global fit over the interval @xmath44 .",
    "other choices give similar results .      in order to obtain @xmath45 as a function of the heavy quark mass @xmath28 we extrapolate the results at three values of @xmath46 for the light quark linearly in @xmath47 to @xmath48 for each @xmath49 .",
    "for the axial - vector current renormalization factor @xmath50 we take the value @xmath51 obtained by applying the improvement procedure with the coupling @xmath52@xcite to the one - loop result@xcite , disregarding a small @xmath49 dependence of a few % over our range of @xmath31 .",
    "the results for @xmath45 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] .",
    "circles and triangles are for the results obtained with the @xmath15 and @xmath53 action in ( 1 ) .",
    "we see that they yield consistent values for @xmath45 in the region of @xmath31 where both actions can be employed .    in order to see the deviation from the heavy mass scaling law @xmath54",
    ", we fit this data with the form , @xmath55 and obtain @xmath56 with @xmath3 2.3(1 ) gev obtained from the @xmath57 meson mass on the same set of configurations , this gives @xmath58 for the @xmath2 meson decay constant in the static approximation .    substituting @xmath59 for the @xmath60 quark mass which is estimated from the @xmath61 mass including the heavy quark mass renormalization@xcite",
    ", we find a substantially smaller value for the @xmath2 meson decay constant in nrqcd : @xmath62 the large coefficient @xmath63=0.60(20 ) in ( [ fit ] ) leads to a significant @xmath6 correction ( @xmath64 30 % ) to the static approximation , which is consistent with the results obtained with propagating heavy quarks@xcite .",
