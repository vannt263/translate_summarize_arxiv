    "traditionally , fixed energy sources ( e.g. batteries ) have been used to power energy - constrained wireless networks , such as sensor networks , which lead to limited operation time .",
    "although the lifetime of wireless networks can be extended by replacing or recharging the batteries , it may be inconvenient , costly , and even dangerous ( e.g. , in a toxic environment ) or infeasible ( e.g. , for sensors implanted in human bodies ) . as an alternative solution , energy harvesting ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) has recently received a great deal of attention since it provides more cost - effective and truly perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks through scavenging energy from the environment .    among other commonly used energy sources ( e.g. solar and wind ) , radio signal radiated by ambient transmitters becomes a viable new source for energy harvesting .",
    "in particular , harvesting energy from the far - field radio - frequency ( rf ) signal transmission opens a new avenue for the unified study of wireless power transmission and wireless communication since radio signals carry energy and information at the same time .",
    "there are two main paradigms of research along this direction .",
    "one line of work focuses on studying the so - called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) by characterizing the achievable trade - offs in simultaneous wireless energy transfer ( wet ) and wireless information transmission ( wit ) with the same transmitted signal .",
    "swipt has recently been investigated for various channel setups , e.g. , the point - to - point additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel @xcite , @xcite , the fading awgn channel @xcite , @xcite the multi - antenna channel @xcite-@xcite , the relay channel @xcite , @xcite , and the multi - carrier based broadcast channel @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another line of research is aimed to design a new type of wireless network termed wireless - powered communication network ( wpcn ) in which wireless terminals communicate using the energy harvested from wireless power transmissions .",
    "the wpcn has been studied under various network setups , such as cellular network @xcite , random - access network @xcite , and multi - hop network @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , another type of wpcn",
    "was investigated , where mobile charging vehicles are employed to wirelessly power the user devices in the network .",
    "in addition , the wireless - powered cognitive radio network was considered in @xcite , where active primary users are utilized as energy transmitters for charging their nearby secondary users .",
    "furthermore , in our previous work @xcite we have studied one particular wpcn model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_systemmodel ] , where a hybrid access - point ( h - ap ) operating in time - division half - duplex ( hd ) mode coordinates wet / wit to / from a set of distributed users in the downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) transmissions , respectively .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that there exists a fundamental trade - off in allocating dl time for wet and ul time for wit in the hd wpcn , since increasing dl time increases the amount of harvested energy and hence the ul transmit power at each user , but also decreases users ul time for wit given a total dl and ul time constraint .",
    "on the other hand , there has been recently a growing interest in full duplex ( fd ) based wireless systems , where the wireless node transmits and receives simultaneously in the same frequency band , thus potentially doubling the spectral efficiency",
    ". however , due to the simultaneous transmission and reception at the same node , fd systems suffer from the self - interference ( si ) that is part of the transmitted signal of a fd node received by itself , thus interfering with the desired signal received at the same time",
    ". self - interference cancellation ( sic ) is a key challenge for implementing fd communication since the power of si typically overwhelms that of the desired signal .",
    "various sic techniques have been proposed in the literature ( see e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and the references therein ) , which are generally based on either analog - domain sic ( i.e. , sic in the wireless propagation channel or before the received signal is processed by analog - to - digital conversion ( adc ) ) , digital - domain sic ( i.e. , sic after adc by digital signal processing techniques ) , or their assorted combinations . by state - of - the - art sic techniques today , it has been reported that sic up to @xmath0db higher power of the desired signal can be implemented @xcite .",
    "in addition , various effects of practical hardware limitations on fd communications , e.g. , the finite dynamic range of transmit and/or receive filters @xcite , @xcite , have been investigated .",
    "furthermore , full - duplex techniques have been applied in various wireless communication applications for performance enhancement , e.g. , spectral efficiency in relay network @xcite , multi - user cellular network @xcite , wireless physical layer security @xcite , and cognitive radio network @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the fd technique to the wpcn shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_systemmodel ] , to further improve throughput .",
    "we assume that the h - ap operates in the fd mode to broadcast energy and receive information to / from the distributed users simultaneously over a given frequency band , thus significantly saving the time for separate dl wet and ul wit as compared to the hd - wpcn considered in @xcite .",
    "the proposed wpcn with the h - ap operating in fd mode is thus termed full - duplex wpcn ( fd - wpcn ) , to differ from its hd - wpcn counterpart in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the fd technique applied at the h - ap in our proposed fd - wpcn is for hybrid energy / communication transmission / reception , which is in sharp contrast to conventional setups with fd communications . however ,",
    "similar to fd communication systems , the proposed hybrid energy / communication fd system is also subject to the practical issue of imperfect sic at the h - ap , i.e. , the interference due to the dl energy signal is not perfectly cancelled at the receiver for decoding the ul information .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows :    * for the proposed fd - wpcn , we present a new protocol to enable simultaneous wet in the dl and wit in the ul over the same band .",
    "it is assumed that the h - ap operates in fd mode , while the users all operate in time division hd mode for the ease of implementation , which transmit independent information to the h - ap by time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) in the ul and harvest energy in the dl when they do not transmit .",
    "we also compare the proposed protocol for fd - wpcn with the harvest - then - transmit protocol proposed in @xcite for hd - wpcn .",
    "* under the proposed protocol for fd - wpcn , we characterize the maximum weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) of users in fd - wpcn , by jointly optimizing the time allocated to the h - ap for dl wet and users for ul wit and the transmit power of the h - ap over time subject to a given total time constraint as well as the average and peak transmit power constraints at the h - ap . for the purpose of exposition",
    ", we first consider the ideal case of perfect sic at the h - ap in fd - wpcn .",
    "it is shown that the wsr maximization problem in this case is convex , and hence we obtain the closed - form solution for the optimal time and power allocations by applying convex optimization techniques .",
    "it is revealed that the optimal time and power allocation is aligned with maximally exploiting the opportunistic communication gain in the network , i.e. , more time is assigned to the users with stronger channels and/or higher rate weights ( priorities ) in ul wit , while more power is broadcast by the h - ap in dl wet over time slots of the users with weaker channels and/or lower weights .",
    "* we then study the practical case with imperfect sic in fd - wpcn . in this case",
    ", the wsr maximization problem is shown to be non - convex , and thus is difficult to be solved optimally .",
    "alternatively , we propose an efficient algorithm to find at least one locally optimal solution for this problem based on the optimal solution obtained for the ideal case without si by iteratively optimizing the time and power allocations to maximize the wsr . *",
    "furthermore , we investigate the wsr maximization problem in a baseline hd - wpcn system based on the harvest - then - transmit protocol proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out the main difference between the optimization problems considered in this work and our prior work @xcite for hd - wpcn . in this paper",
    ", we study the joint power and time allocations subject to both the average and peak transmit power constraints in hd - wpcn , whereas only time allocation is considered in @xcite by assuming constant transmit power at the h - ap . by comparing the achievable rates of fd- versus hd - wpcns",
    ", it is revealed that the former is more beneficial than the latter when the si can be more effectively cancelled at the h - ap and/or the peak transmit power constraint at the h - ap is more stringent .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : systemmodel ] introduces the fd - wpcn model and the proposed transmission protocol .",
    "section [ sec : fd_wpcn ] presents the optimal time and power allocation solutions to the wsr maximization problems in fd - wpcn for both the ideal case of perfect sic and the practical case with imperfect sic , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : hd_wpcn ] addresses hd - wpcn , and shows the optimal solution for wsr maximization in this case .",
    "section [ sec : simulationresults ] presents simulation results for comparing the performance of fd - wpcn against hd - wpcn .",
    "finally , section vi concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig_systemmodel ] , this paper considers a wpcn with wet in the dl and wit in the ul .",
    "the network consists of one h - ap and @xmath1 users ( e.g. , sensors ) denoted by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , operating over the same frequency band .",
    "it is assumed that users are sufficiently separated from each other .",
    "the h - ap is equipped with two antennas , and each user terminal is equipped with one antenna .",
    "the h - ap is assumed to have a stable energy supply , whereas each user terminal does not have any embedded energy sources . as a result ,",
    "the users need to replenish energy from the received signal from the h - ap in the dl , which is then used to power operating circuit and transmit information in the ul . in this paper , we focus on the case of fd - wpcn where the h - ap operates in fd mode to broadcast energy for the dl wet and receive information for the ul wit at the same time , while the users are assumed to all operate in time - division hd mode to harvest energy in the dl and transmit information in the ul orthogonally over time , for the ease of implementation . for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we also consider the case of hd - wpcn where the h - ap also operates in time - division hd mode , as studied in our previous work @xcite .      in fd - wpcn",
    ", the h - ap operates in fd mode by utilizing one antenna for transmitting energy to users in dl and the other antenna for receiving information from users in ul simultaneously over the same bandwidth .",
    "the dl channel from the h - ap to @xmath2 and the corresponding reversed ul channel are denoted by complex coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "in addition , there exists a loopback channel at the h - ap , through which the transmitted dl energy signal of one antenna is received at the other antenna in addition to the ul information signal received from users .",
    "it is assumed that at the h - ap , analog domain sic @xcite , @xcite is first performed , @xmath7 thus denotes the effective loopback channel after analog domain sic at the h - ap .",
    "we also assume that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath7 all follow quasi - static flat - fading , and the channels remain constant during each block transmission time , denoted by @xmath11 , for the system of interest .",
    "it is further assumed that the h - ap knows perfectly @xmath9 and @xmath8 , @xmath12 .        in fd - wpcn ,",
    "simultaneous wet in dl and wit in ul can be achieved , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fd_wpcn_framestructure ] .",
    "each transmit block is divided into @xmath13 slots each with duration of @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16th slot is a dedicated power slot for dl wet only , the user can still receive energy from the dedicated power slot . ] and the @xmath17th slot , @xmath12 , is used for both dl wet and ul wit . during the @xmath17th slot , the h - ap broadcasts wireless energy with transmit power , denoted by @xmath18 , to all users in the network .",
    "we thus have @xmath19 in addition , the average transmit power of the h - ap over @xmath13 slots in each block and the peak transmit power of the h - ap at each slot are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath22 @xmath23 in ul , we assume that the users transmit independent information to the h - ap using tdma , i.e. , the @xmath17th slot is allocated to user @xmath2 for wit , @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , during the @xmath17th slot in each block , the h - ap broadcasts energy using one antenna and receives information from @xmath2 using the other antenna simultaneously , since the h - ap operates in fd mode . on the other hand",
    ", each user @xmath2 , @xmath6 , transmits its own information to the h - ap in the @xmath17th slot , but can not receive energy from the h - ap in the same slot , since it operates in time - division hd mode and has one single antenna . instead",
    ", @xmath2 harvests energy from the h - ap during the other @xmath1 slots during which it is not scheduled for information transmission , and stores the energy harvested to be used in future .",
    "consider the @xmath24th slot in one block of interest , @xmath25 , during which the transmitted signal of the h - ap is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "s can also be used to send dl information ( e.g. , control signals from the h - ap to users ) at the same time , which is not considered further in this paper .",
    "interested readers may refer to the literature on swipt @xcite-@xcite .",
    "] we assume that @xmath26 is a pseudo - random sequence which is _ a prior _ known at the h - ap satisfying @xmath27 = 1 $ ] . during the @xmath24th slot , the received signal at @xmath2 , @xmath28 ,",
    "is then expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the received signal and noise at @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath32 is sufficiently large such that the energy harvested due to the receiver noise is negligible .",
    "furthermore , energy harvested due to the received ul wit signals from other users is also assumed to be negligible since users are sufficiently separated from each other and their transmit power level is much lower as compared to @xmath32 in practice .",
    "thus , the amount of energy harvested by @xmath2 during the @xmath24th slot can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath12 , is the energy harvesting efficiency at @xmath2 . for convenience , we assume @xmath35 in the sequel of this paper without loss of generality . from ( [ eq_fd_harvested_energy_ui_slot_j ] ) , the average harvested energy of @xmath2 in each block is thus expressed as @xmath36    on the other hand , during the @xmath24th slot with @xmath37 , @xmath2 transmits its own information to the h - ap using a fixed portion of its average harvested energy per block given by ( [ eq_fd_harvested_energy_ui ] ) . within @xmath38 amount of time allocated to @xmath2 for ul wit in slot @xmath39 ,",
    "the average transmit power of @xmath2 is thus given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the portion of the average harvested energy used for wit by @xmath2 in steady state .",
    "in this paper , we assume that @xmath42 s are given constants .",
    "we further denote @xmath43 as the signal transmitted by @xmath2 during slot @xmath39 . for each user , @xmath44",
    "is assumed to be of zero mean and unit power , i.e. , @xmath45 = 0 $ ] and @xmath46 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the received signal at the h - ap in the @xmath39th slot is then expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denote the received signal , the si due to simultaneously transmitted energy signal @xmath51 , and the noise at the h - ap , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 stands for a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with mean @xmath55 and variance @xmath56 .    without loss of generality , the effective loopback channel after analog domain sic ,",

    "even after analog domain sic , however , the power of remaining si can be still much larger than that of received signal in practice @xcite , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "this raises in the following considerations .",
    "first , the received signal at the h - ap given by ( [ eq_fd_receivedsignal_ap ] ) is distorted due to limited transmitter and receiver dynamic ranges due to large power of si , which introduces additional noise whose power is proportional to transmit and/or receive power at the h - ap ( see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . for the purpose of exposition",
    ", we assume the same signal processing implemented at the h - ap as in @xcite with ideal automatic gain control ( agc ) and infinite transmitter dynamic range .",
    "thus , the additional receiver noise , denoted by @xmath62 , is merely due to finite receiver dynamic range and the resulting quantization error after adc @xcite , where @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 is derived from ( [ eq_fd_receivedsignal_ap ] ) as @xmath66 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,}\\ ] ] @xmath67    furthermore , although channel estimation can be made sufficiently accurate such that performance degradation due to the estimation errors in @xmath9 and @xmath8 , @xmath12 , is assumed to be negligible , performance degradation due to estimation error of @xmath7 can not be neglected in general due to more dominant power of si than that of received information signal at the h - ap .",
    "we thus denote @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 denoting the estimation of @xmath59 and channel estimation error , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath71 and @xmath72 . given @xmath69",
    ", we can apply digital domain sic by subtracting known si as in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath73 from the received signal after adc .",

    "] due to finite receiver dynamic range and imperfect channel estimation .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that switching transmit and receive antennas at the h - ap does not change the achievable rate in ( [ eq_fd_achievablerate ] ) since @xmath88 depends only on @xmath89 , which is the product of the ul and dl channel power gains .          in the case of hd - wpcn",
    ", we assume that the _ harvest - then - transmit _ protocol proposed in @xcite is employed to achieve orthogonal wet in dl and wit of users in ul , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hd_wpcn_framestructure ] .",
    "since neither h - ap nor users can transmit and receive signals at the same time , with the harvest - then - transmit protocol , energy is broadcast in dl during the @xmath16th slot only whereas the @xmath17th slot , @xmath12 , is used for ul wit only , in which users transmit their independent information to the h - ap by tdma .",
    "it then follows that @xmath90 denote @xmath91 as the transmit power of the h - ap for dl wet in slot @xmath92 in the case of hd - wpcn .",
