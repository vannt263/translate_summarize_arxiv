    "db1conditions have been dubbed db conditions .",
    "while a physical realization in terms of a medium interface has not yet been found , it was shown that the db conditions can be obtained in terms of a layer of a certain medium upon the db boundary @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the db and db conditions have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , a novel set of conditions , generalizing those of the soft - and - hard boundary @xcite and the db boundary , was obtained in @xcite when considering the interface of a certain class of skewon - axion media @xcite , also called ib media @xcite .",
    "they were subsequently dubbed shdb boundary conditions and expressed in the form a#n#b + # u#e&=&0 , shdb1 + a#n#d -#u#h&=&0 , shdb2 where @xmath5 satisfying @xmath6 is a unit vector parallel to the boundary . for @xmath7",
    "the conditions can be seen to reduce to those of the soft - and - hard boundary , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , while for @xmath10 they approach the db conditions . since",
    "all of the recently introduced boundary conditions , and , have been shown to be physically realizable in terms of medium interfaces , they can not be considered just mathematical concepts .",
    "however , there still is work to do to go one step further by realizing the medium parameters in terms of metamaterial structures .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to define a set of boundary conditions which is related to the shdb boundary in the same way as the db boundary is related to the db boundary , i.e. , a boundary which is a generalization of the soft - and - hard and db boundaries .",
    "because the db boundary conditions could be produced by transforming the db boundary conditions in terms of a layer of uniaxial medium @xcite , it appears reasonable to apply a similar idea for the shdb boundary .",
    "let us consider a uniaxial anisotropic medium defined by the medium equations # d & = & _ t#e_t + _ z#u_ze_z , + # b & = & _ t#h_t + _ z#u_zh_z , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are components transverse to the @xmath13 axis .",
    "assuming that the axial parameters become infinitely large , _ z ,  _ z , we must have @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the medium while @xmath16 and @xmath17 may have finite values . in practice",
    "it is sufficient that the parameters satisfy _ z_t ,  _ z_t .",
    "such a medium has been previously called by the name waveguiding medium @xcite , because a wave propagates along the axis of the medium like in a set of parallel waveguides .",
    "the axial components of the maxwell equations are # u_z._t#e_t & = & -jb_z , bz + # u_z._t#h_t & = & jd_z , dzwhile the transverse components can be represented in the form _",

    "t=. operating and by @xmath18 leads to the equations ( _ z^2+k_t^2)#e_t + # h_t= 0 + 0 . suppressing the dependence on @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", the transverse fields must be of the form # e_t(z ) + # h_t(z)= # e_t^+ + # h_t^+e^-jk_tz + # e_t^- + # h_t^-e^jk_tz .",
    "waves actually , @xmath21 and @xmath22 may have any dependence on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . inserting in and and equating components with similar @xmath13 dependence , we obtain the following relations for the field amplitude vectors : # e_t^+ & = & -#u_z_t#h_t^+ + # e_t^- & = & # u_z_t#h_t^- .",
    "let us now consider the fields in the waveguiding medium at @xmath4 as related to fields at @xmath23 when choosing d = = ,  ( jk_td ) = j. the relations can be expressed as # e_t(0 ) & = & j_t#u_z#h_t(-d ) , ed + _ t#h_t(0 ) & = & -j#u_z#e_t(-d ) .",
    "hdthe corresponding relations for the axial field components are obtained by substituting in and , and the same differentiated by @xmath18 . skipping the details ,",

    "a layer of quarter wavelength of such a medium transforms boundary conditions at @xmath23 to other boundary conditions at @xmath4 . by letting the transverse parameters grow in magnitude with respect to the parameters @xmath24 of the exterior medium , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the layer becomes a thin sheet .",

    "let us assume that the half space @xmath49 is isotropic with parameters @xmath24 while the other half space @xmath50 is taken care of by boundary conditions at @xmath51 .",

    "shdb2 because the boundary conditions and correspond to a certain physical setup , a layer of waveguiding medium upon a half space of certain medium yielding the shdb conditions , they have a firm physical significance .",
    "it is proposed that they will be called shdb boundary conditions . from the analogy of conditions and , , the more general form for the shdb boundary conditions is a(#n#n#b ) + # v(#e)&=&0 , shdb3 + a(#n#n#d ) -#v(#h)&=&0 , shdb4 where @xmath59 for @xmath5 defined by , . in this form",
    "the shdb conditions are valid for more generally than for planar boundaries . making the transformer a thin sheet , and because its transforming property is local , it can be shaped to follow any smooth surface ( with radius of curvature assumed much larger than the thickness of the sheet ) .",
    "the two extreme values of the parameter @xmath60 yield two known special cases : @xmath7 corresponds to the conditions of the soft - and hard boundary while @xmath10 corresponds to those of the db boundary .",
    "since in the form , the boundary conditions do not involve the frequency , they are valid to any time dependence like the shdb conditions , . furthermore , both sets of boundary conditions are self dual .",
    "in fact , making the simple duality transformation @xcite # e_d= j#h ,  # h_d=#e / j , with @xmath61 , the pair of conditions , can be seen to remain invariant .",
    "thus , just like the shdb boundary conditions , , the shdb boundary conditions are self dual .",
