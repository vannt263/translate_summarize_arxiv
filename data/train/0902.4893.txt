    "the near absence of such systems ( @xmath10kpc ; @xmath8@xmath1 ) in the nearby universe ( @xmath11% ; trujillo et al .",
    "2009 ) implies a strong evolution in the structural properties of these massive galaxies as cosmic time evolves .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to explain the dramatic size evolution of these galaxies since @xmath12 ( khochfar & silk 2006 ; naab et al .",
    "2007 ; fan et al .  2008",
    "; hopkins et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the main difference among them is the role of mergers to increase the size of galaxies .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) support an evolutionary scheme where galaxies grow by the effect of quasar feedback , which removes huge amounts of cold gas from the central regions hence quenching the star formation .",
    "the removal of gas makes galaxies to puff up in an scenario similar to the one proposed to explain the growth of globular clusters ( hills 1980 ) . in the merging scenario ,",
    "however , merger remnants get larger sizes than those of their progenitors by transforming the kinetic energy of the colliding systems into potential energy . whereas both scenarios predict a strong size evolution for the most massive galaxies , they disagree on the expected evolution of the velocity dispersion of the massive galaxies at a given stellar mass .",
    "the merging scenario basically predicts no evolution ( at most a 30% since @xmath12 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ) , whereas the puffing up scenario predicts central velocity dispersions to be @xmath13 times larger than in present - day massive galaxies .    constraining the evolution of the velocity dispersion of spheroid - like massive galaxies over the last 10gyr turns therefore crucial to test the above models of galaxy evolution , as well as to determine the importance of dark matter halos in setting the velocity dispersion of galaxies as cosmic time evolves . for these reasons , in this letter we measure for the first time the velocity dispersion of such massive galaxies at @xmath2 , and compare it with a compilation of velocity dispersions for similar galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "in what follows , we adopt a cosmology of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and h@xmath17kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 .",
    "to determine the typical velocity dispersion of spheroid - like massive ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) galaxies at @xmath2 , we have used the publicly available stacked spectrum of galaxies at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 r.m.s .",
    "standard deviation ) presented in c08 as part of the gmass ( galaxy mass assembly ultra - deep spectroscopic survey ) project .",
    "the spectrum consists of an averaged spectrum of 13 massive galaxies with a total integration time of 480h . only 2 of them are classified as disks , whereas the remaining 11 galaxies have either a pure elliptical morphology or show a very concentrated and regular shape ( see c08 ) .",
    "the stacked spectrum is consequently representative of massive spheroid - like objects at that redshift .",
    "individual galaxy spectra were taken at vlt with fors2 , using the grism g300i and a 1arcsec width slit , providing a spectral resolution of fwhm @xmath20  in the range @xmath21(@xmath22 ) . before stacking ,",
    "each individual galaxy spectrum was previously de - redshifted and assigned to have the same weight in the @xmath23  rest - frame range .",
    "the resulting rest - frame stacked spectrum was set to 1 / pix over the range @xmath24 .",
    "aimed at computing the velocity dispersion of the above stacked spectrum , it is required the use of reference template spectra of well known spectral resolution .",
    "section  [ template ] provides a full description of these data - sets , as they are basic input ingredients of the analysis carried out in this work .",
    "we have compiled from previous work velocity dispersions estimates of spheroid - like massive galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "this includes data from van der wel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) updated , when possible , with van der wel et al .",
    "( 2008) for galaxies in the ranges @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and from di serego alighieri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for galaxies at @xmath29 .",
    "these authors also provide stellar masses and effective radii for their galaxies . in both samples",
    "the galaxies were classified visually .",
    "the vast majority of these objects present a prominent spheroidal component an are identified as either e or s0 .",
    "when necessary , stellar masses have been transformed assuming a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf . to allow a meaningful comparison along the entire redshift interval explored in this paper , only galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath30 have been considered .    to have a local reference , we have retrieved velocity dispersions , effective radii and stellar masses ( chabrier imf ) from the sdss nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( dr6 ; blanton et al .",

    "assures that the majority of the sources have a hubble morphological type t @xmath32 ( i.e.  ranging from e to s0 ; ravindranath et al .",
    "we have estimated the average velocity dispersion of the above galaxies in two redshift bins : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we have not tried higher redshifts to assure individual signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) larger than 10 .",

    "movel is designed to characterize the line - of - sight velocity distribution of a galaxy spectrum by determining its first two moments : the mean radial velocity and the velocity dispersion .",
    "based on fourier analysis , the code relies on the movel and optema algorithms of gonzlez ( 1993 ) .",
    "a full explanation of the fourier techniques and their particular implementation in both routines is provided in the above work .",
    "the movel algorithm , an improvement of the classic fourier quotient method by sargent et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , is an iterative procedure in which a galaxy model is processed in parallel to the galaxy spectrum . in this way",
    ", a comparison between the input and recovered broadening functions for the model allows to correct the galaxy power spectrum from any imperfections of the data handling in fourier space .",
    "the optema algorithm is designed to overcome the typical template mismatch problem by computing an optimal template for the galaxy spectrum .",
    "it is fed with a set of representative template spectra which are scaled , shifted and broadened according to initial values for the mean line strength , the radial velocity , and the velocity dispersion .",
    "then , the algorithm finds the linear combination of the template spectra that best matches the observed galaxy spectrum .",
    "this constitutes a first composite template which is fed into the movel algorithm .",
    "the output kinematic parameters are then used to create an improved composite template and the process is iterated until it converges .",
    "this iterative approach then provides an optimal template while simultaneously computing the radial velocity and velocity dispersion of the galaxy spectrum .",
    "ideally , the reference template spectra are chosen to be representative stellar spectra observed with an identical technical setup to that of the galaxy spectra .",
    "this way , the instrumental broadening is the same in both data sets , and the broadening difference between galaxy and template spectra , @xmath50 , is a direct measurement of the galaxy starlight velocity dispersion , @xmath51 .",
    "since this is not the case for the c08 stacked spectrum , the different instrumental resolutions of the distinct data sets employed in this work must be taken into account .",
    "this is explained in detail in sections  [ template ] and  [ results ] .",
    "we have restricted the kinematical analysis of the c08 spectrum to those regions containing strong spectral features from the galaxy starlight . because of the lack of available template spectra of high - enough spectral resolution covering the full spectral range of interest , we employ three different data sets .",
    "two of them allow us to analyze the near ultraviolet ( nuv ) region at @xmath52 , which comprises e.g.  several feii lines at @xmath53 , the @xmath54 mgii doublet and the @xmath55 mgi line .",
    "the third template set is chosen to provide a complementary analysis from the region @xmath56 , with features such as the @xmath57 nh and @xmath58 cno bands .",
    "the three sets of template spectra , whose properties are summarized in table  [ table ] , are described below :    \\i ) first , from the coolcat database , an hst / stis echelle catalog of normal late - type stars with r @xmath59 ( ayres 2005 ) , we have selected eight spectra ( from f5v to g0iii spectral types ) covering the range @xmath60  with no gaps in between .",
    "they have been re - binned at 1 / pix to match the linear dispersion of the c08 spectrum .",
    "using movel and their corresponding high - resolution coolcat spectra as reference templates , we have derived that the spectral resolution of the re - binned templates is @xmath61kms@xmath4  at @xmath62 , which corresponds to r @xmath63 .",
    "\\ii ) the second set of template spectra consists of a subsample of nineteen ssp spectral energy distributions by g.  bruzual ( private communication ) .",
    "they are based on the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) code and the next generation spectral library , ngsl ( gregg et al .  2004 ; heap & lindler 2007 ) , with an average resolution of r @xmath64 .",
    "the employed ssp models span ages from 0.3 to @xmath65gyr with metallicities [ z / h ] @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , hence enclosing the 1gyr and solar metallicity estimate of c08 for their stacked spectrum . again , using movel and the above high - resolution coolcat spectra , we have accurately derived the spectral resolution of bruzual s models in the range @xmath60 , which is @xmath69kms@xmath4 , or equivalently r @xmath70 .",
    "\\iii ) finally , for the red side of the c08 stacked spectrum , we employ a set of eighteen stellar spectra ( dwarfs and giants ranging from g0 to k7 spectral types ) observed with lris at keck as radial velocity templates for a different program ( beasley et al .",
    "having used the grism 600/4000 and the 1arcsec longslit , the stellar spectra have a fwhm of @xmath71  ( @xmath72kms@xmath4  at 3565 ; r @xmath73 ) as determined from the width of the wavelength calibration arc lines .",
    "the spectra span the range @xmath74 , although only the blue side is employed here .",
    "we have analyzed the stacked spectrum of c08 with movel using the three sets of template spectra described in section  [ template ] . in each case , to constrain the reliability of the final results , the procedure has been repeated several times using different initial movel parameters , like e.g.  different starting velocity dispersions ( from 50 up to 300kms@xmath4 , in steps of 50kms@xmath4 ) .    for each single movel solution ,",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion of the c08 stacked spectrum , @xmath75 , is derived as    @xmath76    where @xmath50 is the broadening difference between the optimal template spectra and the c08 spectrum ( as derived from movel ) , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are their intrinsic instrumental resolutions , and @xmath79 is the redshift ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "note that , since the individual galaxy spectra of c08 were previously blue - shifted before stacking , the effective instrumental resolution at rest - frame decreases by ( @xmath81 ) .    for each set of template spectra , table  [ table ] presents @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the mean values of @xmath50 and @xmath75 , with their errors accounting for the r.m.s .",
    "standard deviation of the solutions obtained from the different movel trials .",
    "an error - weighted mean of the three independent @xmath75 solutions , which are indeed consistent within the uncertainties , gives @xmath82kms@xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that the above value could be slightly overestimated , as redshift uncertainties for the 13 stacked galaxy spectra may have enlarged artificially the width of the lines .",
    "we have also checked that the strong @xmath54 mgii doublet in the stacked spectrum ( @xmath83 , table  2 of c08 ) is not significantly broadened by potential non - stellar mgii absorptions in surrounding galactic gas clouds .",
    "such absorptions are typically much narrower ( @xmath84kms@xmath4 , as they follow much colder kinematics ) and @xmath85 times weaker ( @xmath80 , for typically @xmath86 clouds ; see e.g.  steidel et al .",
    "1994 ; churchill et al .",
    "therefore , even if they were present in all galaxies , @xmath87 could be overestimated by only @xmath88kms@xmath4  ( up to @xmath86kms@xmath4  if all galaxies were damped - ly@xmath89 systems , which is very unlikely as no lyman absorptions are detected ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two disk galaxies in the stacked spectrum had lower typical velocity dispersions of e.g.@xmath90kms@xmath4 , the derived @xmath91 would underestimate the true velocity dispersion of early - type galaxies by @xmath20kms@xmath4 .",
    "overall , since the above systematics may cancel each other , @xmath92kms@xmath4is probably a reasonable estimation of the velocity dispersion of @xmath0@xmath1  spheroid - like galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates representative movel solutions as derived from each template set . at the nuv , coolcat stars ( panel @xmath93 ) provide a slightly more broadened solution than the ngsl  based ssp models ( panel @xmath94 ) , probably due to the intrinsic differences between the two template sets and their effects on the template mismatch problem . at longer wavelengths ( panel @xmath95 ) ,",
    "the galaxy spectral features look somewhat blurred , probably by sky line residuals commonplace of the near - infrared region at observed frame .",
    "still , in all cases the solutions reproduce nicely the c08 spectrum .    to further check the reliability of the movel results",
    ", we carried out monte carlo simulations in which we added gaussian noise ( to match s / n = 5 to 30@xmath4 ) to artificially broadened reference template spectra ( @xmath96kms@xmath4 , in steps of 50kms@xmath4 ) from our three template sets .",
    "for such _ fake _ galaxy spectra , we run the movel procedure in the same way as we did for the c08 stacked spectrum . as expected",
    ", the accuracy in the final solution decreases with the decreasing s / n of the problem spectrum .",
    "the typical scatter of the derived @xmath50 solutions averaged over all the simulations and initial movel conditions are 55 , 24 , 12 , and 8kms@xmath4  for s / n = 5 , 10 , 20 , and 30@xmath4 respectively .",
    "more importantly , for all s / n values , the recovered mean @xmath50 is statistically consistent with the assumed input value , hence supporting the reliability of both the method and @xmath75 .",
    "the fact that the velocity dispersion of @xmath0@xmath1spheroid - like galaxies at @xmath2 is @xmath3kms@xmath4has important consequences to understand their evolution :    * it confirms that high - z spheroid - like massive galaxies are truly massive objects .",
    "the unexpected strong size evolution of these objects has cast some doubts about the reliability of their stellar mass estimates , which relies on the assumption that the imf is the same at all redshifts .",
    "in fact , an appropriate change of the imf with redshift would mitigate the problem of the strong size evolution .",
    "however , the derived velocity dispersion at @xmath2 is similar to that of present - day galaxies with @xmath97@xmath1 , consequently constraining any potential change of the imf with redshift . *",
    "it alleviates the problem of understanding how massive and compact galaxies at high - z can evolve through merging since that epoch .",
    "an extraordinarily high velocity dispersion at high - z ( e.g.  @xmath98kms@xmath4 ) would have implied that the gravitational potential depth of the system would be so intense that it would not easily evolve in size .    to put in context the above result",
    ", figure  [ fig2 ] shows the sizes ( top panel ) and velocity dispersions ( bottom panel ) for the c08 galaxies and the compilation of spheroid - like galaxies of similar mass described in section  [ thedata ] .",
    "these galaxies follow nicely the observed strong size evolution found in other independent larger samples where completeness effects are accounted ( trujillo et al . 2007 ; b08 ;",
    "dashed line ) , hence probing that the sizes of the objects explored in this paper are typical of average spheroidal - like massive galaxies at those redshifts .",
    "it is also clear that , although massive spheroid - like galaxies have experienced a strong size evolution ( a factor of @xmath7 since @xmath99 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2007 ) , the velocity dispersion has evolved mildly by a factor of @xmath100 in the same redshift interval ( see bernardi 2009 for a similar trend at @xmath101 ) .",
    "this result is crucial to constrain the different scenarios proposed so far to explain the dramatic size evolution since @xmath102 , as they disagree in the amount of evolution expected in their velocity dispersions .    in the puffing up scenario of fan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , velocity dispersions change as @xmath103 . using the observed size evolution of b08 , @xmath104 , the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the expected @xmath51 evolution under this scenario .",
    "it increases with redshift in a way that galaxies are expected to double their @xmath51 at @xmath99 .",
    "the observed velocity dispersions are compatible within the error bars with this scenario up to @xmath105 .",
    "however , at @xmath106 the discrepancy between theory and data is apparent .    in the merging scenario of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , at a fixed stellar mass , @xmath51 evolves with redshift as @xmath107 where @xmath108 ) is the dark matter contribution to the central potential relative to that of the baryonic matter at @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the effective radius of the halo .",
    "again , we have used the b08 size evolution as an input into the merging model prediction . the grey area in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] encloses the expected @xmath51 evolution when @xmath111 varies between 1 and 2 .",
    "the agreement between the merging scheme and the observed evolution looks reasonably good at all redshifts .",
    "following hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , to explain why @xmath51 has only changed weakly since @xmath102 it is necessary to consider that the observed velocity dispersion is driven by two components : the baryonic matter and the dark matter halo .",
    "both components contribute linearly to the central gravitational potential of the galaxy , hence @xmath112 ) . assuming that @xmath113 evolves weakly with time ( most simulations show that halos build inside - out , so the central potential is set first and just the outer halo grows with time ) , the dark matter effect on the central potential of the galaxy ( i.e.  on @xmath51 ) basically remains unchanged at a fixed @xmath114 .",
    "however , the influence of the baryonic matter on the gravitational potential has changed strikingly since @xmath99 , at present - day being @xmath7 times smaller due to the expansion of the object . the relative influence of the dark matter on setting the inner potential increases with the decreasing effect of the baryonic matter . in fact , the data look in agreement with an almost symmetric influence of dark and baryonic matter ( i.e.  @xmath115 ) in setting the central gravitational potential of present - day objects .",
