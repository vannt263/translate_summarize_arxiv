    "in quantum field theory the permanent contrast between experimental measurements and theoretical models has been possible due to the development of novel and powerful analytical and numerical techniques in perturbative calculations .",
    "the fundamental problem that arises in perturbation theory is the actual calculation of the loop integrals associated to the feynman diagrams , whose solution is specially difficult since these integrals contain in general both ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences . using the dimensional regularization scheme , which extends the dimensionality of space - time by adding a fractional piece @xmath7 , it is possible to know the behavior of such divergences in terms of laurent expansions with respect to the dimensional regulator @xmath8 when it tends to zero . on the other hand",
    ", the structure of the integral associated to the diagram gets increasingly more complicated when the number of external lines , loops or energy scales is increased , and therefore finding an analytical solution is extremely difficult . of the many different techniques @xcite that have been developed in order to evaluate diagrams",
    ", we can mention : integration by parts ( ibp ) , contour parametric integrations in terms of a mellin - barnes representation of the diagram , the differential equations method ( dem ) , etc .    in the context of the present article , and as comparison",
    ", particular mention has to be made to the mellin - barnes integral representation of the diagram , which is a very powerful technique for finding solutions in cases of arbitrary propagator powers .",
    "these powers can typically occur when tensorial structures are present , when in the reduction process generate scalar integrals with different powers of propagators , or when there are subtopologies associated to massless virtual particles contained in a propagator , which adds to the corrected propagator a fractional piece proportional to the dimensional regulator @xmath8 .",
    "something similar happens when the integration by parts ( ibp ) technique is used .",
    "the mellin - barnes integral representation consists in transforming the momentum space representation of the diagram into a parameter space representation , written in terms of multiple contour integrals .",
    "as solution of these contour integrals one obtains generalized hypergeometric series , whose arguments can be 1 or ratios of the different energy scales that are present in the diagram , and which give information about the different kinematical regions , specified in a natural way by the convergence conditions of these functions .",
    "the most interesting aspect of these type of solutions is that they can be analyzed and expanded in terms of the dimensional regulator @xmath8 in the kinematical region of interest . for this purpose there",
    "are known techniques , algorithms and calculation packages @xcite , @xcite , mka .",
    "the specific technique that is used here was suggested originally by halliday and ricotta @xcite , and it is known as ndim ( negative dimensional integration method ) since it performs an analytical continuation in the dimension @xmath9 to negative values .",
    "this can be done due to the fact that the loop integrals have the property of being analytical functions in arbitrary dimension . in actual practice",
    "this technique represents the diagram in terms of a multiple series whose argument contains a certain number of kronecker deltas , and the solutions emerge naturally from evaluating the sums in the different forms that these kronecker deltas allow .",
    "the final result can be always expressed in terms of generalized hypergeometric series .",
    "this method has been developed and used by several authors , among them a. suzuki , a. schmidt , e. santos , c. anastasiou , e. glover and c. oleari , in many applications to essentially one - loop diagrams .    since the results obtained in both the mellin - barnes representation of diagrams and in this technique are generalized hypergeometric functions , it is possible to compare them . in these series solutions",
    "the arguments are ratios of the different energy scales that appear in the diagram , and the parameters that characterize them are linear combinations of the propagator powers and the dimension @xmath9 . in such applications",
    "it was shown that at one - loop level @xcite this technique is comparable in terms of the complexity of the solutions , with the one coming from the mellin - barnes representation .",
    "nevertheless , in two or more loop cases @xcite , the conclusion is that the generalization of the formalism is not adequate since the solutions get to be complicated in two essential aspects .",
    "first , the number of terms or contributions of the obtained hypergeometric functions is very high , being for some two - loop diagrams typically of the order of thousands ; and second , the complexity of each of them increases , due to the fact that the multiplicity of summations of each hypergeometric series is also quite high and goes over the number needed to represent the solutions with respect to the number of kinematical variables that the diagram possesses . both of these aspects make that any analytical study of the solutions to the @xmath2-loop case be very complex , and therefore it becomes impossible to identify each of the contributions associated to a specific kinematical region .",
    "nevertheless , this technique has an important advantage , since it is much simpler to apply that the mellin - barnes representation , because it changes the process of solving multiple contour integrals into solving a linear system of equations , a fact which is very important when one is trying to find analytical solutions .",
    "we have verified that in the form presented by the above mentioned authors , the application of this method to the general @xmath2-loop case is indeed very cumbersome .",
    "this can be observed in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 multinomials that are present in the schwinger parametric integral , which contains a number of terms that increases rapidly when the number of loops or independent external momenta increases .",
    "therefore the number of multiple expansions grows with respect to the number of constraints or kronecker deltas which can be obtained from the mathematical structure of the diagram and which are an essential part of the method . in the present work",
    "we have deduced the method in a different way , and in the process found analytical solutions to @xmath12 diagrams which moreover can contain massive propagators , extending significantly in this manner the number the diagrams that can be treated with this technique . in our formalism",
    "it is not necessary to work with the momentum representation of the graph .",
    "we start with its schwinger parametric representation , using for this purpose the mathematical structure of a generic @xmath2 loops , @xmath13 propagators and @xmath3 independent external lines diagram , shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which provides a quick and direct way of obtaining the parametric representation integrand without explicitly solving the momenta integrals .",
    "we concluded that this technique is quite powerful and has significant advantages in the evaluation of an infinite set of diagrams belonging to certain topological classes , which is something that will be shown in the specific examples that are going to be presented in this work .",
    "our emphasis in this work will be mainly in finding appropriate procedures for obtaining the general solutions associated to a diagram , instead of analyzing in more detail each one of them , although we do it in cases in which they are naturally related to the convergence relations of the hypergeometric series , which in turn define the kinematical regions where these series are valid .",
    "the presentation of this work is as follows : section @xmath14 contains a description of the algebraic components of ndim that are required for feynman diagram evaluation , with emphasis on the basic formulae of the method , which are related to delta kronecker generation , topology related series expansions , and the reasons for naming this series multiregion expansion .",
    "we also explain here how to obtain in a simple way the explicit schwinger parametric representation in the different energy scales of a general topology @xcite .",
    "finally we describe an algorithm that sums up the above in a systematic sequence of steps for solving feynman 's integrals and thus obtaining the multiregion expansion of the diagram , or which could be called presolution of the graph . in section @xmath15",
    "we have considered three examples where the technique is applied systematically , starting from a simple known case until a complex one with until now unknown solutions .",
    "the first is the bubble diagram @xmath16 , with equal mass @xmath17 propagators .",
    "this is a basic example , whose solutions are well known @xcite .",
    "the following example corresponds to the diagram called cbox @xmath18 , which although has known solutions @xcite , in the on - shell massless case this is the first time in which they have been obtained using this method .",
    "increasing the complexity , we solve this diagram for the case of three massive propagators , which by itself is a new result .",
    "finally we find the solution for a four - loop propagator case @xmath19 , where the idea is to show that this technique is very efficient and effective when one factorizes and expands systematically the multinomials of the parametric representation .",
    "initially the massless propagator case is solved , and then with two massive propagators .",
    "the massless case is quite simple , since it is a diagram which is reducible loop by loop ; but the second case is much more difficult , and the solution is in terms of hypergeometric series of the type @xmath20 , in the variables @xmath21 or its reciprocal @xmath22 , according to the kinematical region of interest .",
    "this result is relevant given the difficulty of obtaining it using any other method in the case of arbitrary propagator powers . in section @xmath23 we discuss some conceptual aspects of the integration method and about the complexity of the solutions when the number of loops @xmath2 increases .",
    "we have added a section @xmath24 as an extension of @xmath25 , in which we present several topologies that contain two or three different energy scales , and where we only show the presolution in each case .",
    "finally in the appendices we include a summary of definitions and properties of one and two variable hypergeometric functions , which appear frequently in the solutions of feynman integrals ; and also a more detailed description of the equations that support the integration method here presented , with some of its properties .",
    "the most important aspect of this work is that we have been able to associate this technique with a certain family of @xmath2-loops topologies , with respect to which it is applied very easily and directly , with the possibility of solving a large number of feynman diagrams , which can even contain massive propagators with arbitrary powers .",
    "this allows to extend considerably the known solutions of feynman diagrams .",
    "in order to understand the method , we describe now its main components :    - : :    obtaining schwinger s parametric representation .. - : :    foundations of the integration method ndim . - : :    general algorithm .",
    "let us consider a generic topology @xmath26 that represents a feynman diagram in a scalar theory , and suppose that this graph is composed of @xmath13 propagators or internal lines , @xmath2 loops ( associated to independent internal momenta @xmath27 , and @xmath3 independent external momenta @xmath28 .",
    "each propagator or internal line is characterized by an arbitrary and in general different mass , @xmath29 .    using the prescription of dimensional regularization",
    "we can write the momentum integral expression that represents the diagram in @xmath1 dimensional minkowski space as :    @xmath30    in this expression the symbol @xmath31 represents the momentum of the @xmath32 propagator or internal line , which in general depends on a linear combination of external @xmath33 and internal @xmath34 momenta : @xmath35 . we also define @xmath36 as the set of powers of the propagators , which in general can take arbitrary values . after introducing schwinger s representation ,",
    "it is possible to solve the momenta integrals in terms of gaussian integrals .",
    "the result is schwinger s parametric representation of the diagram associated to equation @xmath37 , which in the general case is given by the expression :    @xmath38    we have introduced for simplicity the following notation @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 multinomials respectively , defined in terms of determinants @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the determinant defined by the equation :    @xmath44    the matrix symmetric @xmath45 has dimension @xmath46 , and is called initial parameters matrix",
    ". it is possible to easily built it when @xmath37 is parametrized , and the internal products of loop momenta and external momenta are expanded , with coefficients which correspond to the elements of the matrix @xmath47 . for a better understanding of this process let us define the momentum:@xmath48with the @xmath49-@xmath50 @xmath51^{t}$ ] . using this definition the following matrix structure",
    "is generated , as a previous step to the loop momenta integration:@xmath52with which we finally identify the symmetric matrix @xmath45 .",
    "let us develop briefly a simple example , for the massless one loop diagram shown in fig",
    "the corresponding 1-loop integral is given by the expression :    @xmath53    we then apply schwinger s parametrization , and then obtain the following equation :    @xmath54    or equivalently , expanding the squares in the exponents and factorizing in terms of internal and external momenta , it follows that :    @xmath55 \\right ] .\\ ] ]    now the matrix of parameters is obtained directly from the exponent by simple observation , that is :    @xmath56    where it has been used that @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "later on other examples are going to be presented . for more details",
    "@xcite .",
    "the exponential structure that the integral of parameters @xmath59 presents allows that the integration method ndim be developed and sustained by two formulae that can be deduced starting from the following integral expression :    @xmath60    where the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in general complex . using this equality one can justify the essential point of this method , and which is related to the equivalence ( from an operational point of view ) of the integration sign with a quantity which is proportional to a kronecker delta",
    "in order to show this we expand the integrand of equation @xmath63 :    @xmath64    now the corresponding evaluation of the integral will not be done in the usual way , but we define an identity which fulfills the equality .",
    "this happens after we define the following operational relation :    @xmath65    for convenience we introduce the following notation in order to write the operational equivalent of the integral sign :    @xmath66    where the parenthesis @xmath67 has implicit the constraint associated to the kronecker delta and which furthermore satisfies the following property ( see appendix ) :    @xmath68    or in a simplified manner :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is an arbitrary index or parameter and where we have also defined the factor :    @xmath71    on the other hand , by applying successively equation @xmath63 and then equation @xmath72 to an arbitrary multinomial , we can deduce the second fundamental formula on which the method is based .",
    "this expresses the fact that a multinomial of @xmath73 terms can be written as a multiregion expansion , in such a way that it simultaneously contains all limiting possible cases with respect to the relation between the different terms present in the multinomial .",
    "the series so described can be written as :    @xmath74    where the terms @xmath75 @xmath76 and the exponent @xmath77 are quantities that can take arbitrary values .",
    "the expression @xmath78 contains the @xmath73 expansions that can be obtained and which have the general form :    @xmath79    where the definition of the factor in @xmath80 has been generalized : @xmath81 in this case each of the expansions @xmath82 that can be obtained starting from @xmath83 correspond to multivariable generalized hypergeometric series of multiplicity @xmath84 , and each one of them contains the limiting cases or region where it is fulfilled that @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "once the parametric representation of a diagram @xmath88 has been obtained , the following step is to evaluate it , and for this purpose it is necessary to make an expansion of the integrand starting from the exponential functions if they are present , and then continuing with a multiregion expansion of all the multinomials that the process generates according to formula @xmath89 the expansion process ends when one finally obtains only one term , which is a product of all the schwinger parameters .",
    "now it only remains to replace all the integrals according to the formula @xmath72  or its equivalent @xmath90 .",
    "we have obtained in this manner the presolution or multiregion expansion of the feynman integral considered in @xmath91 . in the case in which we consider a generic topology @xmath26 , characterized by @xmath92 different mass scales , @xmath13 propagators and @xmath93 lorentz invariants associated to internal products of the external independent momenta , then the general form of the multiregion expansion is given by the following expression :    @xmath94    where it is possible to identify the following quantities :    @xmath95 corresponds to the multiplicity or number of summations that conform the multiregion expansion , or in this case the presolution of the diagram @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath96 corresponds to a kinematical lorentz invariant , which is a quadratic form of the independent external momenta .",
    "@xmath97 correspond to linear combinations of the indexes @xmath98 , with the exception of @xmath99 , which includes a dependence on the dimension @xmath100 :    @xmath101    the coefficients of the sum indexes @xmath102 in the linear combinations @xmath103 and @xmath104 are ( + 1 ) and in the case of @xmath105 the indexes have coefficients ( -1 ) , except for @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath106number of propagators or equivalently number of parametric integrations that the method transforms into @xmath13 kronecker deltas .",
    "@xmath107number related to the total number of multiregion expansions performed over the integrand of the parametric representation , which in turn generates @xmath108 constraints or equivalently @xmath108 kronecker deltas .",
    "a particular case corresponds to vacuum fluctuation diagrams , in which case the presolution @xmath109 is written in the following form :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 .    in order to find the solutions ,",
    "it is necessary to evaluate the sums using for this purpose the existing constraints among the indexes of the sum , represented by the @xmath112 kronecker deltas ; but as it can be seen there are several ways to do this evaluation .",
    "in fact the number of different forms to evaluate the presolution of @xmath26 using the kronecker deltas is given by the combinatorial formula :    @xmath113    each one of these forms of summing using the kronecker deltas in @xmath26 , generates in turn as a result a multiple series , which corresponds to a generalized hypergeometric function , whose multiplicity is given by :    @xmath114    in general it is not always possible to use the @xmath115  deltas in order to evaluate the corresponding @xmath115 sums , since this will depend on the combination of indexes with respect to which the sum should be done .",
    "if this happens , these cases are simply not considered as contributions to the solution and therefore are discarded . in those cases",
    "in which we do have a relevant expansion contribution , this corresponds to an serie representation of the set of kinematical variables that are present in the problem , in the form of ratios of the different energy scales that appear in the topology .",
    "since the multiregion expansion @xmath109 contains all the limits simultaneously , all the solutions that have been found are related between them by analytical continuation , which is realized implicitly by the integration method ndim .    in practical terms",
    "the idea of the method is to generate finally an expansion that represents the diagram @xmath26 , the multiregion expansion , characterized by multiplicity @xmath73 , in combination with a number @xmath116 of kronecker deltas . using this it is possible to find the solutions in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions of multiplicity @xmath117 . in this work",
    "we study in detail only the topologies where the @xmath118 variables of the different solutions correspond to ratios of the different @xmath119 energy scales present in the topology , that is when the following condition if fulfilled :    @xmath120      this is an essential point in the improvement of the integration technique ndim , since it explains the procedure used to find the optimal multiregion expansion of the diagram @xmath26 .",
    "the idea is quite simple and it is related to the form in which the expansion of the multinomials @xmath41 and @xmath40 of the parametric representation @xmath121 is done .",
    "the technique consists in the factorization of all the multinomials which are repeated two or more times in the integrand , without expanding them until they factorize in one term as product of the previous expansions . in the same way the process is repeated for all the submultinomials that the process generates and ends when finally one obtains one single monomial which is a product of the @xmath13 schwinger parameters . finally applying equation @xmath72 ,",
    "the integrals get associated to @xmath13 kronecker deltas .",
    "the main result that is achieved by such a procedure is the minimization of the number of expansions , increasing the number of submultinomials that have to be expanded and since each multiregion expansion done over them generates one kronecker delta , using formula @xmath83 it is clear that the number of deltas is also maximized .",
    "let us see the following examples where it is verified that this systematic expansion indeed generates generalized hypergeometric functions of minimized multiplicity @xmath118 , and that in general less terms than in previous approaches are part of the solution of the diagram .",

    "@xmath139    although we have presented very simple examples , they illustrate the advantages of first doing the factorization and then expanding systematically a multinomial . in these examples",
    "we verify that the multiplicity of each hypergeometric function finally obtained decreases when using the factorization procedure of repeated submultinomials , and also the number of relevant expansions obtained from the multiregion series is reduced as well .    for the particular case of feynman integrals ,",
    "the equivalent schwinger parametric representation is composed of two multinomials , @xmath41 and @xmath40 , and the factorization and expansion process shown in the examples is directly applicable to them .",
    "here we present an algorithm for finding the solution of an arbitrary feynman diagram :    1 .",

    "the most appropriate procedure is to solve the linear system corresponding to the constraints among the indexes , obtained from the kronecker deltas , and assume that such indexes in these equations correspond to independent free variables .",
    "thus we obtain a set of solutions for the indexes that are not free , in terms of the @xmath118 free indexes , of the parameters @xmath149 and of the dimension @xmath9 .",

    "the solution in each kinematical region corresponds to the algebraic sum of all the contributions that have the same kinematical argument or variable .",
    "the final result is the evaluation of the diagram @xmath26 in terms of all its series solutions .",
    "in order to show explicitly the integration technique , let us consider three applications .",
    "the first corresponds to the evaluation of the one - loop massive propagator . through this simple and known problem we present the formalism and proposed notation . in the second example , the cbox diagram , it is already possible to notice the efficiency of an adequate factorization . in this case",
    "the solution is also known and has been already obtained using a different method to the one proposed here , which is useful in order to compare the simplicity of the ndim with respect to other methods .",

    "is in this process where resides the possibility that the integration method be generalized to @xmath2 loops for both massless and massive diagrams . in this respect",
    "we worked out a procedure that allows for an adequate factorization of the multinomials @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the moment in which they are generated , which is something very useful since without it the number of sums of these multinomials can be quite large , depending on the number of loops and external lines that the topology has .    in this work",
    "we have treated cases in which the multiplicity of the series that conform the solution fulfilles the condition @xmath340 , where @xmath6 is the number of different energy scales present in the diagram . with this criterion",
    "we have classified in three families the topologies considered here , and for each case we give the recipe to factorize the multinomials @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the topologies that are included in this category are those that in the case in which the theory does not contain masses , they can be evaluated loop by loop by successive application of the formula corresponding to the one - loop diagram :    @xmath341 ^{a_{1}}\\left [ ( q_{1}+p_{1})^{2}\\right ] ^{a_{2 } } } ,   \\label{f37}\\ ] ]    whose explicit solution is :    @xmath342    where the factor @xmath343 is defined as :    @xmath344    the formulae @xmath345 and @xmath346 can be represented graphically as shown in fig .",
    "a situation that happens quite often together with the loop by loop reduction is when there are two scalar propagators in series and associated to the same mass scale , with powers @xmath347 and @xmath348 in the propagators . in this case",
    "such powers can be summed and replaced by only one , characterized by the power @xmath349 .",
    "graphically this is represented in fig .",
    "the massless diagrams which applying formula @xmath346 can be evaluated recursively loop by loop , are also capable of evaluation considering all loops simultaneously and even if different mass scales are added to the topology . that this can be done depends only on finding the optimal factorization of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for this purpose",
    "we use the well known topological analogy between feynman diagram and resistive electrical circuits , in the sense that in both something  flows in their branches and something  is conserved in their vertices . but this analogy goes further , since electrical resistors in an electrical network are equivalent to schwinger 's parameters in feynman diagrams . the analogy is obvious if we observe fig .",
    "8 .    in this example",
    "the following can be seen : in the feynman diagram one finds that the ratio between the multinomials @xmath41 and @xmath40 is given by the expression :    @xmath350    for simplicity we have taken @xmath351 , since the results are independent of this choice . similarly the equivalent resistance of the electrical circuit shown if the figure can be easily evaluated , giving :    @xmath352    the resemblance of these mathematical structures and also considering the graphic equations shown above , allow us to explain the reason why a massless @xmath2-loop feynman diagram can be reduced loop by loop in the same way that a resistive circuit can be reduced in terms of sums of series and parallel resistors .",
    "both systems have the same topological characteristics .",
    "therefore , using this similitude it is possible to think in doing sums of parameters  depending on whether we have series or parallel propagators , and with this it is possible to find the ratio @xmath353 and thus identify directly the multinomials @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , the main advantage is not really the determination of these multinomials , but the fact that in this way it is possible to find simultaneously the adequate factorization for the diagrams solvable directly and recursively loop by loop , since in the process of reducing the diagram in terms of series and parallel branches , the factorizations of the type @xmath354 , adequate for the application of ndim , are generated automatically .",
    "this is the trick used in the example @xmath15 in order to find the factorizations .",
    "a particular case are vacuum fluctuation diagrams , for which the multinomial @xmath41 vanishes , and therefore for finding @xmath40 it becomes necessary to assume that the diagram corresponds to a propagator , and for that purpose we adequately add two external lines , in such a way that the topology be reducible loop by loop .",
    "then the same recipe as above is applied , the ratio @xmath353 is determined and finally the already factorized multinomial @xmath40 is found .",
    "notice that the factorizations of the type @xmath354 contain the parameters that belong to the same loop ( once the subtopologies of the loop propagators have been reduced ) , which seems natural since the series - parallel reduction can be done one loop at the time .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that it is possible to do this parameters reduction independently on whether the propagators are massless or massive , which is due to the fact that the mass scales do not appear in the multinomials @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the parametric integral .",
    "moreover , it is thus clear that when adding equal mass scales , these can only be associated to the same loop , and therefore we can be sure that the series solutions increase the multiplicity in one unit , which is logical since one more mass scale has been added . as an example , if in the multinomials the factor @xmath355 appears , it is possible to add to the topology equal masses in various possible situations and associate to the integral of parameters the following exponential factors :    @xmath356    in the case in which equal masses are distributed in different loops , in most situations it will not be possible to factorize adequately the multinomials and the integration method will generate extra sums in the series solutions , whose arguments would be one .",
    "the way to think about this is that when masses are put into different loops this really corresponds to different mass scales and therefore the multiplicity of the series solution will grow with the different number of mass scales in the problem .      for topologies with more than two external lines ,",
    "the previous trick is not useful .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a generic procedure that can provide an optimal factorization for the multinomial @xmath40 , which in this case is the one that determines and conditions the adequate factorization that must be done in @xmath41 .",
    "this procedure can be applied in general to any two - loop diagram , although only in certain topologies optimal results are obtained , according to the criteria expressed in @xmath357 . in actual practice",
    "the factorization of @xmath40 is done directly from the matrix of parameters of the diagram , and since we are considering the two loop case , @xmath40 is obtained from the determinant of the @xmath358 symmetric submatrix that relates the loop momenta only .",
    "the general structure of the determinant is given by the expression :    @xmath359    where the terms @xmath360 and @xmath361 are 1-linear combinations of schwinger parameters , such that they do not contain common parameters among them , that is @xmath362 .",
    "the term @xmath363 is a combination of the parameters that are common in the diagonal elements .",
    "the form of @xmath40 comes from the determinant of this matrix , that is :    @xmath364    where we can do the following factorizations in case they are necessary :    @xmath365    @xmath366    @xmath367    when adding one more mass scale , the appropriate factorization will depend on the form in which this scale gets distributed , and them in the integrand the following factor appears :    @xmath368    this provides us with a general recipe for the case of two - loop diagrams and more than two external points . in our work",
    "only three topologies are suitable for applying the method and producing optimal solutions , that is they fulfill the condition that the solution multiplicity is less than the number of energy scales of the diagram .",
    "these are indicated in fig .",
    "the last case we will consider is a combination of the two - loop topologies shown in fig . 9 , with the addition of subgraphs in the loop by loop reducible propagators , and with the advantage that it is also possible to include masses in them . in this manner",
    "it becomes possible to extend to @xmath369-loops the two - loop topologies shown previously .      in this work",
    "we have applied the method to certain @xmath2-loop class of diagrams characterized for having one , two or three different energy scales , and such that the solutions correspond only to series of zero , one or two variables respectively .    with this restriction in the type of solution , the topologies to which is possible to apply the technique ndim",
    "advantageously are the following :    * one loop topologies with two , three and four external points , which have been studied in refs . @xcite . *",
    "all @xmath2-loop topologies of two external points which are loop by loop recursively reducible in the massless propagators case , but to which one or two mass scales are added . *",
    "all @xmath2-loop vacuum fluctuation topologies that are reducible loop by loop , and to which up to three different energy scales can be added . * some two - loop diagrams , shown in fig .",
    "to all these topologies more loops can be added by including one - loop insertions in the propagators , and since it is also possible to assign mass to these insertions , we can therefore study a great variety of graphs with this integration technique . in conclusion",
    "a large family of @xmath2-loop diagrams can be evaluated with this method .",
    "our results indicate that the number of parameters that characterize the generalized hypergeometric functions that are obtained as solutions to the diagrams increases linearly with the number of loops @xmath2 of the graph . in the case of topologies that have two energy scales ,",
    "the solutions are always expressible as generalized hypergeometric series of the type @xmath370 , where @xmath371 corresponds to the hypergeometric order and the quantity @xmath372 is the total number of parameters that it has .",
    "let us see how the number of loops @xmath2 affects the order of the hypergeometric series in the solution .",
    "we consider the following examples which are associated to the diagram in fig .",
    "10 , and which have two different energy scales @xmath373 and @xmath2 loops . for this class of diagrams",
    "we show two topologies which have masses associated to one of the loops , with the difference that while the first ( a ) has one massive propagator the second ( b ) has both propagators massive , and the rest of the propagators are massless .",
    "the solutions that we have found for these diagrams are given in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath370 , where the graphs with the condition ( a ) have series solutions of the form :    @xmath374    @xmath375    while for diagrams of the form ( b ) we get :    @xmath376    @xmath377    the example @xmath25 of this work corresponds precisely to a diagram of the type ( b ) , in which @xmath378 and whose solutions are just hypergeometric series of type @xmath20 .",
    "another family of solutions that we can consider are vacuum fluctuations of the type shown in fig . 11 , composed of two energy scales @xmath379 and which gives rise to solutions of the form :    @xmath380    @xmath381    in case in which there are three energy scales , the solutions can be expressed in terms of double hypergeometric series . in the calculations performed in the case of one - loop diagrams @xcite ,",

    "* the conjunction of the previous premises implies that if one associates @xmath92 equal masses to the propagators of a loop , the multiplicity of the series solution only increases in one unit .",
    "in section @xmath452 the technique was introduced , and also its origins starting from the identity associated to the loop integral parametrization and known as schwinger s parametrization :    @xmath453    and furthermore the equivalence between the integral symbol and a delta kronecker @xmath454 was shown starting from the equation @xmath455 :    @xmath456    for simplicity we have eliminated the limits of the integral , since this identity has validity only in the context of the expansion of the integrand in @xmath457 . this expression is crucial for the development of the method ndim , since in the evaluation of feynman diagrams the corresponding schwinger parametric representation is a generalized structure of the expression @xmath457 .      in order to study some of the properties of @xmath458 , it is convenient to introduce a useful notation for helping us to formalize the mechanism of the technique ndim . thus :    @xmath459    where @xmath460 and @xmath461 are indexes that can assume arbitrary values .",
    "we can write @xmath462 explicitly in two possible forms , according to formula @xmath458 , and then :    @xmath463    starting from @xmath457 it is possible to show the equivalence of both forms in @xmath464 , and for this purpose it is enough to expand the exponential of the integrand and replace @xmath90 for this case .",
    "let us consider the following integral representation :    @xmath465    which in terms of series , in the sense proposed @xmath462 , turns out to be :    @xmath466    selecting now @xmath467 , we directly obtain the equality in @xmath468 .",
    "analogously selecting @xmath469 and using afterwards the identity :    @xmath470    with @xmath471 and @xmath472 , the equality @xmath468 is obtained once again , and therefore the equivalence between both forms of writing @xmath473 is quickly established .",
    "another form of writing @xmath462 , which is quite useful for simplifying terms that contain the factor :    @xmath474    where @xmath252 is an arbitrary index , is the following :    @xmath475    notice that we have made explicit use of the kronecker delta in order to simplify the parenthesis @xmath67 , and since this is in the context of expansions , the kronecker delta remains as an indication of the constraints between the indexes @xmath460 and @xmath461 .      consider the binomial expression :    @xmath476    where the quantities @xmath477,@xmath478 and @xmath479 , can take arbitrary values . in this case",
    "there are two limits or possible regions with respect to the expansion : the region where @xmath480 and the region where @xmath481 .",
    "these expansions are respectively :    1 .",

    "region @xmath481    @xmath483    the factor @xmath484 is called pochhammer symbol and is defined as :    @xmath485    we have thus obtained separate expansions in the two possible limits . nevertheless , it is possible to express both results using a single series that contains both limiting regions . in this sense",
    "we can say that this type of expansion corresponds to a multiregion series representation of the binomial @xmath486 , through the use of the integral representation of the denominator indicated in @xmath457 .",
    "then we have :    @xmath487    and the exponentials are expanded separately , with the result :    @xmath488    making use of the identity @xmath462 we get the multiregion binomial expansion :    @xmath489    where the parenthesis @xmath67 , according to property @xmath464 , can be expressed this time in three different ways , although in each one of them we will have the same kronecker delta which eliminates one of the two sums that are present:@xmath490on the other hand , the number of possible forms of summing @xmath491 using for this purpose the kronecker delta , can be found evaluating the combinatorics @xmath492 , which in this case is @xmath493 .",
    "let us see what happens if one sums with respect to a particular index :",
    "* sum respect to * @xmath179    using for this case the following equality :    @xmath494    and then replacing in @xmath495 , we get :    @xmath496    or equivalently :    @xmath497    which gives the expression associated to the region @xmath498 , obtained previously in @xmath499 .    1 .",
    "* sum respect to * @xmath167    analogously , we now use the identity :    @xmath500    and replacing in @xmath495 , one gets :    @xmath501    an expression that was already found in @xmath502 , and valid in the region @xmath480 .    the fundamental idea that has been exposed in the previous demonstration",
    "is that using the definition @xmath458 one can do a binomial expansion that differs from the conventional expansion , in the sense that one obtains an expression where all the possible limits of the binomial are included simultaneously .",
    "the previous discussion can be generalized to the multiregion expansion of a multinomial of @xmath503 terms :    @xmath504    where for simplicity we have defined the following notation :    @xmath505    the number of expansions that can be obtained starting from @xmath506 is given at most by all the possible forms of evaluating some of the sums , using for this the kronecker delta generated by the same expansion , that is @xmath507 possible forms .",
    "more generally , a function expressed as a multiregion expansion through @xmath73 sums and @xmath116 kronecker deltas , can be evaluated at most in :    @xmath508    possible forms , each one of them expressed in terms of series of multiplicity @xmath509 .",
    "all the resulting series are representations with respect to the ratios between the terms of the multinomial , and all of them correspond to multivariable generalizations of the hypergeometric function .",
    "the original name of the integration method here presented , ndim ( negative dimension integration method ) , comes from applying the expansion and subsequent association , integral@xmath510kronecker delta , over the gaussian integral in @xmath9 dimensions :    @xmath511    where @xmath512 corresponds to a 4-momentum and @xmath513 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "this is a typical integral that appears upon using schwinger s parametrization and after using the completion of squares procedure of the loop momenta . starting from this equation it is possible to deduce in a similar way to equation @xmath514 the following identity @xcite :    @xmath515    since this is in fact a taylor expansion , we assume that @xmath516 , and therefore the constraint associated to the kronecker delta in @xmath517  requires that @xmath518 , that is , la dimension has to be negative , which is then the origin of the name of this integration technique",
    ". nevertheless , there can appear reasonable doubts with respect to some concepts that the ndim uses in its original approach .",
    "it is entirely possible for @xmath9 to be a negative integer considering that the feynman integrals are analytic functions in @xmath9 arbitrary dimensions , but rigorously what is wanted is to solve the loop integrals in the limit @xmath519 and not in the limit @xmath520 .",
    "the inconsistency is even more clear if the dimensional regularization prescription is used , and the dimension @xmath9 now includes a non integer piece , the dimensional regulator @xmath8 , which can not be associated to the sum index @xmath6 in @xmath521 .",
    "such inconsistencies could be resolved if the expansion of the exponential could be written as :    @xmath522    where @xmath523 and @xmath252 is an index that increases in one unit steps .",
    "such an expansion is possible , but for this purpose it is necessary to resort to the area of calculus called fractional calculus rhi , kmi , kol , through which it can be shown that both the derivative and the integration operators can be represented in terms of a unique operator , and in second term shows that the analytical continuation in the operator order can in fact be done , and can be fractional and even complex .",
    "this is very useful in order to justify the validity of the ndim integration technique , and therefore it is necessary to review some concepts for understanding this type of calculus .",
    "we are interested in knowing the nature of the expansion that is performed in the exponential function in @xmath524 , since due to the arguments mentioned before it should not really correspond to a taylor expansion .    in order to provide a more rigorous basis for equation @xmath525 ,",
    "it becomes necessary to define the integration and derivative operators in a generalized form . in fractional calculus",
    "is possible to define the fractional integral of order @xmath513 as follows :    @xmath526    where @xmath527 and @xmath513 is an arbitrary quantity . for the particular case in which @xmath528 in @xmath529 , we get the so called riemann - liouville fractional integral :    @xmath530    another version of the fractional integral can be obtained making @xmath531 , which is called liouville fractional integral :    @xmath532    this last version of the fractional integral will be used in this work in order to justify more rigorously the integration method of feynman diagrams here presented .",
    "certainly this would be incomplete if we do not define also the fractional derivative ( in the liouville version ) . for an order @xmath513 which fulfills that @xmath533 , with @xmath534 , the fractional derivative is defined by the expression @xmath535",
    "$ ] , or in operational terms :    @xmath536    we are particularly interested in the liouville integro - differential operator , so for simplifying the notation let us define @xmath537 , where we can have @xmath538 , which is an integral , or @xmath539 , a derivative .",
    "a property that makes this version of the fractional operator particularly interesting is the effect that it has over the exponential function , and which in practice is an extension of what is done by integrals and derivatives of integer order ( conventional calculus ) over this function :    @xmath540 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{l } \\beta ^{-\\alpha } \\exp ( \\beta x ) \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\beta ^{\\alpha } \\exp ( \\beta x)% \\end{array}% \\right .",

    "\\alpha > 0\\;\\text{(derivation of order } \\alpha \\text{).}% \\end{array } \\label{f44}\\ ] ]    this expression can be easily proved using the equations @xmath541 and @xmath542 .",
    "particular interest has the series representation of the exponential function , since it is the only function over which the expansions in the schwinger parameter integral are done , either because it appears explicitly in the integrand , or because it is used implicitly in order to do the multiregion expansions of the multinomials present in the problem . when the expansions in the integral of the parametric integral are done , we automatically assume that this is a taylor series .",
    "nevertheless , what is really done implicitly is a taylor - riemann expansion of the exponential , which reads :    @xmath543 \\right\\vert _ { x=0}\\dfrac{x^{n+\\xi } } { \\gamma ( n+\\xi + 1)}.\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath544 is arbitrary and fulfills the condition @xmath545 .",
    "notice that taking @xmath546 the taylor series for the exponential is obtained .",
    "moreover , since @xmath547 \\right\\vert _ { x=0}=1 $ ] , according to formula @xmath548 , one gets :    @xmath549    if we make now the change of variables @xmath550 , we can rewrite the previous expansion as :    @xmath551    which looks like the conventional taylor series expansion of the exponential , with the difference that the index of the sum has been analytically continued to negative and fractional values .",
    "this justifies that both @xmath9 and the propagator powers @xmath149 do not change its nature due to some analytical continuation required by the kronecker deltas generated in the process , but rather are the expansion indexes the ones that can acquire arbitrary values , including negative and fractional .",
    "but moreover it justifies the presence of gamma functions in the multiregion expansion of the diagram , both in the numerator and denominator , which having the form @xmath552 , where @xmath6 is an index associated to a sum , give a multiregion expansion not necessarily infinite or vanishing .    after having said that",
    ", it is still necessary to justify what refers to the integration method , since they correspond to hypergeometric series whose summation indexes are positive integers .",
    "this can be explained by saying that for applying the integration method ndim an analytical continuation of the summation indexes has to be done , or equivalently the exponentials are expanded in taylor - riemann series , using the expression @xmath553 . in practical terms",
    "it is enough to assume a fractional arbitrary parameter @xmath554 associated to the indexes of all the sums , and at the end of the integration process , when each contribution to the solution is determined , evaluate the limit :    @xmath555    which naturally happens since all the solutions that are obtained have the factor @xmath556 , and in the limit @xmath546 we have that :    @xmath557    therefore , strictly speaking we should write the multiregion expansion @xmath148 of a generic diagram @xmath26 in the following form :    @xmath558    operationally ndim does not consider the presence of the fractional part @xmath559 in the summation index nor its extension to negative values .",
    "nevertheless , the analytic continuation of the summation indexes and the evaluation of the limit at the end of the process , are inherent to the process and justify why it works .",
    "a confusion might arise from the similarity of the taylor series expansion of the exponential and its taylor - riemann expansion ( equation @xmath560 ) , something that explains why both versions of the expansion give the same result , which in turn shows that there is a conceptual but not operational difference",
    ". thus it would be more appropriate to call the method integration by fractional expansion ( ibfe ) instead of ndim .",
    "in this work we have developed the evaluation of loop integrals of certain class of diagrams with arbitrary @xmath2 .",
    "all the found solutions have been presented in terms of hypergeometric series of one or two variables , which correspond in a natural way to an serie representation with respect to the ratio between the energy scales associated to the graph .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is precisely to provide the necessary information about the hypergeometric functions @xcite and especially with respect to their convergence properties .      in those cases in which the solutions contain",
    "two energy scales the series representations are expressed in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions :    @xmath561    where the factors @xmath562 are called pochhammer symbols , defined as :    @xmath563    the convergence conditions for these series are given according to the magnitude of the argument :    1 .   if @xmath564 the series converges absolutely .",
