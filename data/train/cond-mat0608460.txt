    "there continues to be a controversy about the nature of the ising spin glass .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick model,@xcite with its infinite - range interactions between the spins , is described by the parisi replica - symmetry breaking mean - field theory.@xcite to understand models with short - range interactions on finite - dimensional lattices , however , it is necessary to include the effects of interfaces , which do not exist in a well - defined way in an infinite - range model .",
    "the droplet model of fisher and huse,@xcite which starts from the domain - wall renormalization group ideas of mcmillan@xcite and bray and moore,@xcite and studies the properties of interfaces , provides a very different viewpoint on the spin - glass phase .    in two dimensions ( 2d ) ,",
    "the spin - glass phase is not stable at finite temperature . because of this",
    ", it is necessary to treat cases with continuous distributions of energies ( cde ) and cases with quantized distributions of energies ( qde ) separately.@xcite    in three or more space dimensions , where a spin - glass phase is believed to occur at finite temperature @xmath11 , the general framework of thermodynamics requires that the cde and the qde should be treated on the same footing .",
    "the way this comes about is that in these cases the typical domain wall energy increases as a positive power of the size of the lattice .",
    "thus the quantization energy becomes a negligible fraction of the domain wall energy for large lattices .",
    "all bond distributions behave in a qualitatively similar way , except that the qde have finite ground state entropies.@xcite    amoruso , hartmann , hastings and moore@xcite have recently proposed that in 2d there is a relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fractal dimension of domain walls , and @xmath14 is the exponent which characterizes the scaling of the domain wall energy with size . for the cde case , the existing numerical estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfy eqn .",
    "however , it is unclear if eqn .",
    "( 1 ) should continue to be correct when the scaling exponent for spin correlations , @xmath15 , is not zero . for the qde ,",
    "the current estimates@xcite find @xmath16 .    in three dimensions",
    "it is known from the droplet theory,@xcite that for the qde , which have a positive entropy at @xmath17 , in the spin - glass phase @xmath18 @xmath19 is the exponent for the scaling of domain wall entropy with size .",
    "thus , for the qde , eqn .",
    "( 1 ) provides a relation between the scaling of the energy and the entropy of domain walls .",
    "it is not known how to calculate @xmath13 directly for the qde case , so we need to use eqn .",
    "( 2 ) to check eqn .",
    "( 1 ) in that case .",
    "one might hope that this relation would also hold in 2d , even though the spin - glass order only occurs at @xmath17 .",
    "for the qde , it is known that @xmath20.@xcite then using eqn .",
    "( 1 ) gives @xmath21 , or using eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath22 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath19 by saul and kardar,@xcite found @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath13 can not be less than 1 , this result was interpreted as a strong indication that @xmath24 .    in this work",
    "we will find that eqn .",
    "( 1 ) may not work for the qde case in 2d .",
    "it appears , however , that eqn .",
    "( 2 ) is still correct in 2d , except when the domain wall energy , @xmath4 , is zero .",
    "the actual behavior of the qde probability distributions under finite - size scaling turns out to be more subtle than what has been assumed until recently.@xcite as pointed out by wang , harrington and preskill,@xcite domain walls of zero energy which cross the entire sample play a special role when the energy is quantized .",
    "we will analyze data for the @xmath4 and for the domain wall entropy , @xmath5 , for the ground states ( gs ) of 2d ising spin glasses obtained using a slightly modified version of the computer program of gallucio , loebl and vondrk,@xcite which is based on the pfaffian method .",
    "the pfaffians are calculated using a fast exact integer arithmetic procedure , coded in c++ .",
    "thus , there is no roundoff error in the calculation until the double precision logarithm is taken to obtain @xmath5 .",
    "this extended precision is essential , in order to obtain meaningful results for entropy differences at large @xmath3 . an earlier version of the domain wall entropy calculation,@xcite using data provided by s. n. coppersmith,@xcite was limited to small @xmath0 lattices with even @xmath3 and came to somewhat different conclusions .",
    "we will demonstrate that for @xmath0 square lattices the edwards - anderson@xcite ( ea ) model with a @xmath25 bond distribution has a strong correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the gs domain walls .",
    "because of this correlation , we will need to treat domain walls of different energies as distinct classes .",
    "we will find that the scaling parameter identified by saul and kardar@xcite is the one associated with domain walls having @xmath6 .",
    "it is not , however , the one which controls the dominant behavior for large @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ea model for ising spins is @xmath26 where each spin @xmath27 is a dynamical variable which has two allowed states , + 1 and -1 .",
    "the @xmath28 indicates a sum over nearest neighbors on a simple square lattice of size @xmath29 .",
    "we choose each bond @xmath30 to be an independent identically distributed quenched random variable , with the probability distribution @xmath31 so that we actually set @xmath32 , as usual .",
    "thus @xmath2 is the concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds , and @xmath33 is the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds .",
    "we define the gs entropy to be the natural logarithm of the number of ground states . for each sample",
    "the gs energy and gs entropy were calculated for the four combinations of periodic ( p ) and antiperiodic ( a ) toroidal boundary conditions along each of the two axes of the square lattice .",
    "we will refer to these as pp , pa , ap and aa . in the spin - glass region of the phase diagram , the variation of the sample properties for changes of the boundary conditions is small compared to the variation between different samples of the same size,@xcite except when @xmath2 is close to the ferromagnetic phase boundary and the ferromagnetic correlation length becomes comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "we define domain walls for the spin glass as it was done in the seminal work of mcmillan.@xcite we look at differences between two samples with the same set of bonds , and the same boundary conditions in one direction , but different boundary conditions in the other direction . thus , for each set of bonds we obtain domain wall data from the four pairs ( pp , pa ) , ( pp , ap ) , ( aa , pa ) and ( aa , ap )",
    ". the reader should remember that the term  domain wall \" , as used in this work , refers only to this procedure .",
    "saul and kardar@xcite follow the same procedure used in this work , but use the term  defect \" instead of  domain wall \" .",
    "the domain - wall renormalization group of mcmillan@xcite is based on the idea that we are studying an effective coupling constant which is changing with @xmath3 . for the cde case we can use the energy as the coupling constant . for the quantized energy case ,",
    "what we need to do is a slight generalization of this idea .",
    "we should think of the coupling constant as the free energy at some infinitesimal temperature .",
    "when we do this , the entropy contributes to the coupling constant .",
    "as we will see , the distribution of @xmath4 rapidly becomes essentially independent of @xmath3 as @xmath3 becomes large , except that there are separate distributions for even @xmath3 and odd @xmath3 . under these conditions , it becomes possible to treat each value of @xmath4 as a separate class , representing a different coupling constant .",
    "the domain wall entropy , @xmath5 , is defined , by analogy to @xmath4 , to be the difference in the gs entropy when the boundary condition is changed along one direction from p to a ( or vice versa ) , with the boundary condition in the other direction remaining fixed .",
    "@xmath34 $ ] ,",
    "where the brackets [  ] indicate an average over random samples of the @xmath30 , is expected to increase as a positive power of @xmath3 for any @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , these coupling constants must eventually , at large enough @xmath3 , be controlled by @xmath34 $ ] for any @xmath35 .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath3 which is needed for this to happen depends in @xmath11 .",
    "the droplet model assumes that all these coupling constants , except for the @xmath6 case which has a special symmetry , are equal .    as long as @xmath36 , the two boundary conditions which we are comparing are not on an equal footing . as wang , harrington and",
    "preskill@xcite express the situation , the @xmath36 domain wall does not destroy the topological long - range order .",
    "however , in the @xmath6 case the two boundary conditions are on an equal footing , and the topological order is destroyed . therefore the @xmath6 class of domain walls can be expected to behave in a special way , which differs from the prediction of the droplet model .",
    "it is natural to wonder if topological long - range order can be related to replica - symmetry breaking , and if the @xmath6 domain walls can be described by the replica - symmetry breaking theory . we will not attempt to do this here .",
    "it is important to realize that the meaning of a domain wall is very different when the gs entropy is positive , as in the model we study here , as compared to the standard case of a doubly degenerate ground state . in the standard case",
    "one can identify a line of bonds which forms a boundary between regions of spins belonging to the two different ground states .",
    "it is not possible , in general , to do that when there are many ground states . despite this",
    ", we continue to use the term  domain wall \" .    when @xmath3 is even , the energy difference , @xmath4 , for any pair must be a multiple of 4 .",
    "when @xmath3 is odd , @xmath4 is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an integer.@xcite the sign of @xmath4 for a pair is essentially arbitrary for @xmath39 .",
    "thus we can , without loss of generality , choose all of the domain - wall energies to be non - negative .",
    "our calculated statistics for @xmath4 at @xmath40 , as a function of @xmath3 , for even @xmath3 and odd @xmath3 are given in table  i and table  ii , respectively .",
    "for each @xmath3 , 500 distinct random configurations of bonds were studied .",
    "we obtain four mcmillan pairs for each random sample , so we have 2000 sets of @xmath4 and @xmath5 at each @xmath3 . for",
    "even @xmath41 it turns out , crudely speaking , that about 77% of the time we find @xmath6 , and 23% of the time @xmath42 . for odd @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath44 about 98.5% of the time .",
    "no domain walls with energies greater than 8 were observed at any @xmath3 for these values of @xmath2 .",
    "this , however , does not have much fundamental significance .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath4 is also a weak function of @xmath2,@xcite and a strong function of the aspect ratio of the lattice.@xcite our results are consistent with the results of amoruso _",
    "et al._@xcite    .[tab : table1]domain wall energy statistics for @xmath45 with even @xmath3 .",

    "it is also interesting to observe that the magnitude of the variance , and not merely the slope of the fit , seems to be independent of @xmath4 . except in the special @xmath6 case , @xmath61 is greater than 1",

    "the basic shapes of the histograms in fig .",

    "since @xmath64 , it seems that the histogram for the @xmath42 case can be mapped onto the histogram for the @xmath44 case at a larger @xmath3 .",
    "a way of expressing this is that for large @xmath3 the @xmath5 histograms for @xmath65 should obey one - parameter scaling in the dimensionless variables @xmath66 ^ 2 \\over [ ( s_{dw})^2]~-~[s_{dw}]^2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] if @xmath19 is independent of @xmath56 , then , assuming @xmath67 , @xmath68 where we define @xmath69 by the condition @xmath70 .",

    "as we have seen , the @xmath36 domain walls behave in a way which appears to be essentially consistent with the predictions of the droplet model , but the @xmath6 domain walls do not .",
    "this difference in behavior is due to the symmetry of the @xmath6 case , which forces the average @xmath5 to be zero .    for an @xmath36 domain wall ,",
