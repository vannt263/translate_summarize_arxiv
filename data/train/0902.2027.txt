    "three groups of manganites specified previously according to the size of ln @xcite show a distinct behavior with respect to the thermal treatments at the steps 3 , 4 and 5 , as is illustrated by our table 1 .",
    "because we used for the synthesis of the [ ar-1 ] , [ o-1 ] and [ dis - o ] series the conditions similar to previously reported@xcite , we may attribute three groups of different behaviors in table 1 not only to fe - doped , but also to clean undoped manganites .",
    "stability of the cubic disordered phase pm@xmath43 m turns out to depend on the size of ln .",
    "[ ptb ]    fi2finalrev.eps      we observed that all of our x - ray profiles from `` o@xmath31 '' samples are perfectly fitted with the @xmath56 model ( fig.2 , b ) .",

    ", the coo between mn@xmath14 and mn@xmath13 was initially required from the occurrence of the supercell extra reflections in electron diffraction patterns@xcite . in x - ray profiles , we see only a minor evidence of coo in the improvement of r - factors for the @xmath56 model .",
    "notable improvement was observed for every ln .",
    "[ ptb ]    fi3new.eps    comparing the parameters of lattice cell depending on ln , it is convenient to plot them in function of the volume @xmath58 of the reduced cell , i.e. , perovskite cell ( fig.2 , d ) .",
    "it is shown in fig.3 that the lattice parameters in labamn@xmath9o@xmath31 vary monotonically as the volume of the reduced cell increases with increasing the size of ln .",
    "distortion of the reduced cell can be calculated in lnbamn@xmath9o@xmath31 as @xmath59 . from y",

    "in contrast to the oxygen - depleted phase , the variation of parameters of the oxygen - saturated phase vs. @xmath58 is non - monotonic . considering the distortion of reduced cell @xmath60",

    "( fig.3 ) .",
    "the border between two regions is the same that divides the table 1 according to the products of the treatments [ ar-2 ] and [ o-2 ] .",
    "contrarily to the case of @xmath10 the quality of x - ray rietveld refinement was not improvable with using the enlarged cell @xmath64  @xmath65  @xmath45  @xmath66 .",
    "the tetragonal cell @xmath67  @xmath68  @xmath45  @xmath69(fig.2c ) suits best to all the samples in the layer - ordered oxygen - saturated family , with one exception of ybamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 .",
    "the structure of the latter was refined using the triclinic symmetry ( space group @xmath70 no.2 ) .",
    "previously , the structure of ybamn@xmath71o@xmath28 was described first by the monoclinic symmetry ( group @xmath72 no.3)@xcite , however , a recent high resolution diffraction study@xcite revealed a triclinic distortion , so that the use of the space group @xmath70 is more appropriate , although the resolution in our profiles was insufficient to confirm the triclinic symmetry .",
    "in fact , our refinements in the fe - doped samples could not give any preference to one of the @xmath70 , @xmath72 groups .    in members of each of three groups of manganites ,",
    "as we grouped them by the size of ln in the table 1 , a succession of phase transitions was observed via the magnetization jumps and humps ( fig.4 ) .",
    "these features are roughly same as in undoped manganites , but differ in details . in ybamn@xmath0fe@xmath32o@xmath28 and smbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 , the highest in temperature jump of magnetzation is associated with the structural transition , which is triclinic - to - monoclinic for ln = y@xcite , and tetragonal - to orthorhombic for ln = sm@xcite .",
    "orbital ordering is now believed@xcite to accompany these structural transition ( @xmath73 ) , while the complete charge ordering temperature is attributed@xcite , to a separate small hump shifted from @xmath74 to lower temperature by @xmath75 . in ybamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 , for example @xmath76 k. in the undoped manganite , the temperature of charge ordering @xmath77 is associated with the sharp localization of charge carriers . in the magnetization of ybamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 , the large jump",

    ", the transition is smeared in our fe - doped samples , and the magnetization hump is suppressed by the fe substitution .",
    "another key feature of the doped systems stems from the fact that the values of @xmath74 are slightly suppressed compared to those in the undoped ybamn@xmath9o@xmath28 and smbamn@xmath9o@xmath28@xcite .",
    "the suppression ranges @xmath782%fe@xmath79 are of 50k and 40 k for ln = y and sm , respectively .",
    "[ ptb ]    fi4.eps    despite of the similarity of the values of @xmath80 , there occurs a large difference between the cases of ln = y and sm for the shift of the transition temperature with the reversal of the temperature sweep direction .",
    "such a shift is associated with an energy barrier for nucleation of a new phase within the region of overheating or undercooling the preceding phase .",
    "the hysteresis indicates strongly the first - order character of transition that was observed also in undoped ybamn@xmath9o@xmath28@xcite .",

    "the antiferromagnetic transitions humps were observed@xcite at 290 k and 250 k in the undoped ndbamn@xmath9o@xmath28 and smbamn@xmath9o@xmath28 , respectively , therefore , the @xmath81  value of 286 k is expected for the solid solution nd@xmath37sm@xmath38bamn@xmath9o@xmath82 .",
    "remaining suppression @xmath83 @xmath84 k should be attributed to the effect of fe substitution .",
    "temperature ranges for sweep - reversal hysteresis around @xmath81 are not much different between the three .",
    "according to the table 1 , the disordered phase was obtained in this work from the ordered one , after the thermal treatment at 1400@xmath41c in the flowing gas mixture of 95% of o@xmath9 and 5% of ar . from the synthesis",
    "reported previously @xcite our method differed thus by the precursor and gave the same cubic phases for all ln s except y. only the y - based complex manganite has decomposed into binary manganites by this high - temperature oxygenating treatment .",
    "irrespective of ln , such a heat treatment was destructive for the layered arrangement of ln and ba formed at the first [ ar-1 ] step , and resulted either in isotropic homogeneous distribution of ln and ba , or in their separation for ln = y .",
    "a half among 8 compositions studied ( in upper part of table 1 ) showed a reduced stability of the disordered phase ln@xmath85ba@xmath85mn@xmath86fe@xmath87o@xmath39 with respect to a subsequent oxygen - depletion treatment .",
    "the lower stability of the disordered manganites with small ln correlates with the poorer perovskite tolerance factor .",
    "it is shown in fig.3 that the lattice parameters for the pm@xmath43 m phases [ ar-2 ] obtained after the step 4 are larger than those for the pm@xmath43 m phases [ dis - o ] obtained after the step 3 .",
    "the differences @xmath88 are 0.013 , 0.018 , and 0.019   for ln= la , pr , and nd , respectively .",
    "increasing @xmath88 indicates the increasing oxygen loss at the step 4 . in the [ ar-2 ] samples ,",
    "the oxygen index decreases from la to nd and approaches the value of 2.75 near the border separating pm@xmath43 m and ima2 phases .",
    "this is in agreement with the single - phase [ ar-2 ] sample of sm@xmath37nd@xmath38bamn@xmath0fe@xmath32mno@xmath22 .",

    "in several of the [ ar-2 ] samples the second phase ( fully oxygen - depleted lnbamn@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath31 ) appears because the ima2 structure does not accommodate any oxygen deficiency .",
    "there appears to exist a miscibility gap between the `` o@xmath22 '' and `` o@xmath31 '' phases for the ln in the lower half of the table 1 .",
    "distortion of the reduced cell can be described by the out - of - plane and in - plane parameters , having their origins in the layered ordering of ln and ba and the chainlike ordering of oxygen atoms , respectively . the out - of - plane distortion @xmath89 @xmath90 is just slightly larger than @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "the temperature at which the charge - orbital order sets in is too low to activate the migration of iron between the mn(iii ) and mn(ii ) sites .",
    "therefore , we believe that the dopant species control the in - plane arrangement of the charges and orbitals at the surrounding ions of mn . this becomes possible with decreasing the size of the ordered domain , especially when the coo correlation length becomes comparable to the average distance between the fe dopants .",
    "the size of the mn(ii ) site is too large for the fe@xmath13 ion ; therefore , the fe@xmath99species tend to escape to the smaller site of mn(iii ) .",

    "this asymmetry can be removed by applying a special care to randomize the orientations of platy crystallites at the step of preparation of mssbauer absorber or by setting the sample at magic angle at the step of measuring the spectra@xcite .",
    "since this was not always done in this work , the line intensity ratio of doublets was a free parameter at fitting the spectra .",
    "it is observed more clearly for the sm - group ( fig .",
    "7 ) that the relative area of lines of the main doublet deviates from @xmath109 , so that the sign of the left - to - right line area ratio deviation is changed between the `` o@xmath31 '' and `` o@xmath28 '' series .",
    "this is because the main axis of efg @xmath110axis@xmath79 is perpendicular to layers and @xmath111 in the pyramid feo@xmath31 , but @xmath112 in the feo@xmath28 octahedron compressed along @xmath113axis .",
    "therefore , in the spectra of both samples [ ar-1 ] and [ o-1](figs.6,7 ) , the stronger line is the transition @xmath114 , and the weaker line is the transition @xmath115 .",

    "two of the in - plane oxygens are at 1.91  , two others are at 1.935  , and the apical oxygen is at 2.1  .",

    "however , for the minor doublet in smbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 the @xmath100 value of 1.17 mm / s is larger .",
    "we attribute this increase of @xmath100 to the increased distortion of the pyramid in the equatorial plane .",
    "indeed , in labamn@xmath9o@xmath22 caignaert et al.@xcite reported the in - plane interatomic distances of 1.89 and 1.96  .",

    "the sign of @xmath100 is positive , and the principal axis of efg coincides with the @xmath123axis . despite of the equal wyckoff octahedral and pyramidal position multiplicities , we observe that the octahedral site is more populated by the fe dopants than the pyramidal site .",
    "taking into account the second phase lnbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath31 ( below 11% in table 1 ) would only lower the population of the fe species in the pyramidal site of the main phase .",
    "unequal populations of these doublets are not counterintuitive because iron migrates freely between these sites at the temperature of the [ ar-2 ] treatment .",
    "it must be emphasized that the mechanism of the preference of iron towards the octahedral site in the [ ar-2 ] samples is quite different from the mechanism of the preference of iron towards the mn(iii ) site in the coo state suggested above .",
    "namely , in the case of coo , the iron dopants can not migrate at the temperature of the coo formation , and the preference is ensured owing to the migration of the lattice distortions associated with coo .",
    "final oxygenating treatment [ o-2 ] resulted in @xmath124 mm / s for gdbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 .",
    "this value is not much different from @xmath125 mm / s of [ o-1 ] sample .",
    "concomitantly , one observes a significant line broadening and a strong decrease of doublet asymmetry . both broadening and symmetrization",
    "are caused by converting the sample into nanocrystalline form via oxygenation at the very low temperature of 350@xmath126c .",
    "healing the cracks induced by oxygen intercalation into orthorhombic phase gdbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 is prevented at such a low temperature .",
    "orthorhombicity was previously suggested @xcite to underlie the strains and cracks emerging upon the oxygen intercalation into single crystals of gdbamn@xmath9o@xmath22 .",
    "nanostructured state of our gdbamn@xmath0fe@xmath32o@xmath28 obtained by the [ o-2 ] treatment exhibits the broadening of doublet due to surface effects in small crystallites .",
    "basal faces of such small crystallites could be hardly aligned parallel to plane of mssbauer absorber and the doublet becomes more symmetric .",

    "two doublets were assumed and the linewidths of 0.36 mm / s were obtained for both doublets having the nearly equal areas and the @xmath100 values of -0.74 mm / s and -0.32 mm / s .",
    "negative signs of @xmath100 stand because of negative @xmath127 in the compressed octahedra .",
    "we note that the @xmath128 value of the strongly split component coincide with @xmath100 of the [ o-1 ] sample .",
    "the splitting of weakly split component is close to @xmath104 in labamn@xmath9o@xmath28 in fig.5 .",
    "we note that both @xmath100 and the cell distortions @xmath92 in prbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 and in ndbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28 are by one and half times larger than @xmath100 and @xmath92 in labamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath28(see the upper panel of fig.3 ) .",
    "we attribute the small values of @xmath100 and @xmath92 in the second phase to the absence of of coo . it can be concluded that via mild oxygenation of smbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 we succeeded to stabilize at room temperature ( to quench ) in smbamn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath129 the coo - melted phase .",

    "shortening the coo correlation length is conjectured to explain the single - component spectra for the multisite structures . indeed , shannon ionic radii for mn@xmath13 and fe@xmath13 coincide exactly ( 0.645  ) , while the radius of fe@xmath13 is too small or too big for the sites of mn(ii ) and mn(iv ) , respectively .",
    "the fact that we frequently see the dopants in the site of mn(iii ) but rarely anywhere else suggests the limited involvement of iron into the manganite electronic system .",
    "iron stands alone not only because of stable valence but also owing to the tendency of fe@xmath13 ions to accommodate a less distorted environment matched to the isotropic configuration @xmath162 . on the other hand , in the octahedral environment , the fe@xmath13 dopants probe faithfully the distortion of the lattice .",
    "mssbauer spectroscopy observes the fourfold increase of the electric field gradient in the charge and orbitally ordered phases compared to the unordered ones .",
    "finally , we proposed that the electronically unordered system can be quenched to room temperature in the nanocrystalline phase , although such a quenching was observed mainly in the two - phase samples , where the quenched melted phase coexisted with the conventional ordered phase .",
