    "the central molecular zone ( cmz , also called the nuclear molecular disk ) of the galaxy , a region of radius @xmath4 200pc , is currently considered to contain high density ( @xmath5 @xmath13 @xmath6 ) molecular gas with a high volume filling factor @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the molecular gas has unusually high temperature ( @xmath4 200 k ) and large velocity dispersion ( 1550  km  s@xmath8 ) , indicative of the highly energetic , turbulent nature of the cmz . unlike the hot spots in the galactic disk where a luminous star heats nearby dust , which in turn heats the associated gas , the hot gas in the cmz extends over large distances and suggests a direct and widespread gas heating mechanism . on the other hand , dust in the same area",
    "has been observed to have low temperatures ( @xmath14 30 k ) from far - infrared @xcite and submillimeter @xcite measurements .",
    "studies of the hot gas in the cmz provide information vital for understanding the unusual activity near the nucleus of the galaxy , which includes non - thermal magnetic phenomena @xcite , extended x - ray emission @xcite and their interactions with molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the most direct evidence for high temperature gas in the cmz comes from radio observations of molecules in high rotational levels .",
    "@xcite observed the inversion spectrum of nh@xmath15 in absorption up to the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) = ( 8 , 8) and ( 9 , 9 ) metastable levels , 687 k and 853 k above the ground level , respectively , toward sgr b2 and estimated a temperature of @xmath3 = 200 k and cloud density of @xmath5 = 10@xmath16 @xmath6 . @xcite and @xcite observed other clouds in the cmz , finding nh@xmath15 emission lines from the ( 7 , 7 ) and ( 6 , 6 ) metastable levels , respectively , and reporting similar temperatures and densities .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained similar results toward sgr a. @xcite , using the @xmath17 submillimeter emission line of co found 10@xmath16 m@xmath18 of warm dense gas in the central 10 pc of the galaxy with @xmath3 @xmath4 300 k and @xmath5 = 3 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite , using the same transition , found a lower mean density and temperature over a much larger volume centered on sgr  a. the @xmath17 transition has a critical density of @xmath21 @xmath6 @xcite and thus probes dense regions of the cmz .",
    "recently , @xcite used _",
    "iso _ measurements of the @xmath22(0 ) - @xmath22(5 ) rotational emission lines of h@xmath23 to investigate 16 molecular clouds within the central @xmath4 500 pc of the galaxy .",
    "since critical densities of those transitions are lower , these lines can be detected in low density clouds if a sufficient column density of h@xmath23 exists .",
    "they reported @xmath3 = 150 @xmath7 600 k and @xmath5 = 10@xmath24 @xmath6 , similar to other studies .",
    "very recently , @xcite used observations of atomic fine structure lines , believed to arise in photodissociation regions associated with these clouds , to derive densities of @xmath4 10@xmath25 @xmath6 .    here",
    "we report the discovery of extensive _ low _ density ( @xmath5 @xmath4 100 @xmath6 ) and high temperature ( @xmath3 @xmath4 250 k ) molecular gas in the cmz using infrared absorption lines of h@xmath2 , including a line from the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) = ( 3 , 3 ) metastable level , which was first observed toward the galactic center by @xcite .",
    "h@xmath2 ( protonated h@xmath23 ) is a unique astrophysical probe in that it is observed with comparable column densities ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) in dense cloud cores @xcite and diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "contrary to the expectation from chemical model calculations which predict orders of magnitude lower h@xmath2 number density for diffuse clouds ( because of rapid dissociative recombination with electrons ) , our observations have established that column densities of h@xmath2 per unit visual extinction typically are an order of magnitude _ higher _ in diffuse clouds ( @xmath28(h@xmath2 ) @xmath29 @xmath27 @xmath30 ) than in dense cloud cores ( @xmath28(h@xmath2 ) @xmath31 @xmath27 @xmath30 ) @xcite . since the @xmath30 of 25 - 40 mag @xcite toward the galactic center arises mainly in diffuse clouds @xcite , h@xmath2 is a readily available tool for studying sightlines toward the galactic center .",
    "indeed the observed column densities of @xmath28(h@xmath2 ) @xmath32 @xmath27 toward and @xcite are an order of magnitude higher than other sightlines in the galactic disk .",
    "h@xmath2 is also important for the study of the cmz since , being a charged molecule , it is sensitive to ionization of molecular gas which is expected to be efficient in the cmz with its intense x - ray sources and high magnetohydrodynamic activity @xcite .",
    "h@xmath2 has the structure of an equilateral triangle like the hydrogen atoms in nh@xmath15 , but being simpler , lighter , and electrically charged , it has three salient features not found in nh@xmath15 .",
    "first , h@xmath2 is planar .",
    "thus totally symmetric rotational levels , e.g. , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 0 ) , etc .",
    ", are not allowed by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this makes the ( 1 , 1 ) level the rotational ground state .",
    "second , the metastability of h@xmath2 , although similar to that of nh@xmath15 qualitatively , is very different quantitatively .",
    "the crucial difference relevant to this paper is that while nh@xmath15 in the ( 2 , 2 ) level takes @xmath4 200 years to decay to the ( 1 , 1 ) level by spontaneous emission @xcite , the same emission in h@xmath2 takes only 27 days . on the other hand , spontaneous emission from the ( 3 , 3 ) level of h@xmath2",
    "is rigorously forbidden by the dipole selection rules and the absence of the ( 2 , 0 ) level @xcite .",
    "this results in a highly non - thermal population distribution in the h@xmath2 rotational levels in low density gas .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "here we simply emphasize that the spontaneous emission time of the ( 2 , 2 ) @xmath33 ( 1 , 1 ) transition , 2.35 @xmath34 s , is a very reliable number with an uncertainty of at most 5 % based on the ab initio calculation by @xcite , and it sets an accurate time standard for the thermalization of interstellar h@xmath2 .",
    "spontaneous emissions from higher levels such as ( 2 , 1 ) @xmath33 ( 2 , 2 ) ( 20 days ) , ( 3 , 2 ) @xmath33 ( 2 , 1 ) ( 16 hours ) , and ( 3 , 1 ) @xmath33 ( 2 , 2 ) ( 8 hours ) have even shorter lifetimes .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate increases rapidly with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath1 and thus rotationally hot h@xmath2 rapidly cools except when in metastable levels , ( 4 , 4 ) , ( 5 , 5 ) , ( 6 , 6 ) etc .",
    "this has implications even for laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "third , collisions between h@xmath2 and h@xmath23 are qualitatively different from those between nh@xmath15 and h@xmath23 .",
    "they actually are chemical reactions h@xmath2",
    "+ h@xmath23 @xmath33 ( h@xmath35)@xmath36 @xmath33 h@xmath2 + h@xmath23 in which the protons may scramble in the activated complex ( h@xmath35)@xmath36 during its short lifetime @xcite .",
    "therefore , unlike nh@xmath15 or other neutral molecules such as h@xmath23o and h@xmath23co , ortho- and para- nuclear spin modifications are efficiently converted to each other by collisions with h@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a collision between h@xmath2 and h@xmath23 has higher cross section than one between nh@xmath15 and h@xmath23 , because of the long range @xmath37 langevin potential , making critical densities lower . assuming that the collision rate constant between h@xmath2 and h@xmath23 is close to the langevin rate constant , @xmath38 = 2@xmath39e(@xmath40/@xmath41)@xmath42 = 1.9 @xmath43 cm@xmath25 s@xmath8 , where @xmath40 is the polarizability of h@xmath23 and @xmath41 is the reduced mass of h@xmath2 and h@xmath23 @xcite",
    ", we find that the critical density for the ( 2 , 2)@xmath33 ( 1 , 1 ) spontaneous emission is @xmath4 200 @xmath6 , comparable to the densities of diffuse clouds . therefore , an absence of h@xmath2 in the ( 2 , 2 ) state in warm gas is definitive evidence for low density . at low temperatures",
    "the rate for the collision - induced transition from ( 1 , 1 ) to ( 2 , 2 ) is much less than the langevin rate because of the principle of detailed balancing .",
    "the value is also lower at very high temperatures because of dilution by collisional transitions from ( 1 , 1 ) to other levels higher than ( 2 , 2 ) , but this is compensated by the channeling via rapid spontaneous emission of most of para - h@xmath2 in high rotational levels to the ( 2 , 2 ) @xmath33 ( 1 , 1 ) transition .",
    "these problems are taken into account in the model calculations of paper i.",
    "three spectrometers on three telescopes were used to make the measurements presented here ; the observing log is given in table 1 .",
    "the phoenix spectrometer mounted on the 8  m gemini south telescope is the most suitable for this study because of its location in the southern hemisphere and its high spectral resolution ( 5 km s@xmath8 ) , but its wavelength coverage is limited by its narrow spectral coverage and the availability of order - blocking filters . the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ) on the 8  m subaru telescope is a powerful survey instrument because of its wide wavelength coverage , although its resolution is relatively low ( 15 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the cold grating spectrometer 4 ( cgs4 ) on the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) has a resolution of 8 km s@xmath8 and can be tuned to any wavelength in the 1 @xmath7 5 @xmath41 m interval , but like phoenix has a narrow spectral coverage at each tuning .",
    "details of operations of the spectrometers and data reduction are given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "targets were chosen from bright young infrared stars with magnitudes @xmath45 @xmath46 which have clean infrared continua .",
    "most of the bright stars near the galactic center are late - type stars whose continua are not smooth due to photospheric atomic and molecular absorptions and thus are problematic for detections of weak interstellar absorption lines .",
    "currently , out of the 50 bright galactic center objects studied by @xcite , only 6 have been used .",
    "this difficulty could be partially overcome in the near future by subtracting standard photospheric absorptions from observed spectra .",
    "we have observed sightlines toward 8 infrared sources listed in table 1 .",
    "the best set of spectrum has been obtained in the sightline toward the brightest source gcs 3 - 2 and this spectrum is discussed in detail below . the rest of 7 sightlines",
    "have been observed with lower resolution and will be discussed briefly in section 3.2 .",
    "more detailed studies on these sightlines will be published in future papers .",
    "compared to radio observations , infrared absorption spectroscopy has the disadvantage that mapping is infeasible because observable sightlines are limited to directions of bright infrared sources .",
    "radio observations are also more sensitive and often with higher spectral resolution .",
    "however , infrared spectroscopy has an advantage in its inherent high spatial resolution .",
    "moreover , the determination of column densities via infrared spectroscopy is often more straightforward because of lower optical depths and availability of several transitions in the same wavelength region .",
    "in particular the presence of spectral lines starting from qualitatively different rotational levels , such as the ( 1 , 1 ) ground level , ( 2 , 2 ) unstable level , and ( 3 , 3 ) metastable level , makes h@xmath2 a unique astronomical probe for studies in this paper .",
    "spectra of gcs 3 - 2 at the @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 , @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 , and @xmath47(2 , 2)@xmath48 transitions of h@xmath2 in the @xmath49 window and the @xmath47(1 ) transition of the @xmath50 = 2 - 0 overtone band of co in the @xmath1 window are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "see @xcite for the nomenclature of @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 etc . gcs 3 - 2 is a young massive star bright in the infrared ( @xmath45 = 3.03 , @xmath1 = 6.19 @xcite ) .",
    "it is one of the quintuplet stars @xcite in the region with recent massive star formation located approximately where the non - thermal radio arc crosses the galactic plane at the galactic coordinates @xmath51 = 10@xmath52 , @xmath53 = @xmath74@xmath52 , close to the compact thermal structures known as the pistol and the sickle @xcite .",
    "the intense and sharp absorptions at @xmath752 km s@xmath8 , @xmath733 km s@xmath8 , @xmath75 and + 2 km s@xmath8 , and + 19 km s@xmath8 and + 23 km s@xmath8 , clearly visible both in the h@xmath2 @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 and co @xmath54 spectra of fig .  1 have been known since the early days of the 21 cm h  i spectroscopy and radio - observations of oh , h@xmath23co , and co to be due to clouds in intervening spiral arms @xcite .",
    "the @xmath752 km s@xmath8 absorption arises in the 3 kpc arm @xcite and the @xmath733 km s@xmath8 absorption is due to the 4.5 kpc arm @xcite .",
    "absorptions near + 20 km s@xmath8 have generally been ascribed to the  20 km s@xmath8 cloud \" believed to lie within the cmz @xcite    absorption components near 0 km s@xmath8 , which are ubiquitous and dominant in h  i spectra , often are ascribed to ",
    "local \" arms within a few kpc of the solar system . for co and h@xmath2 , however , the absorptions at these velocities may not be local because , unlike the h  i line , they are not uniformly observed in all sightlines but only toward the galactic center .",
    "@xcite suggested that some of them are near the galactic center .",
    "analyses and discussions of those sharp lines corresponding to low temperature co and h@xmath2 in intervening spiral arms are outside the scope of this paper and will be given separately .",
    "initially we focus our attention on the three broad absorption features with large equivalent widths at @xmath7123 km s@xmath8 , @xmath797 km s@xmath8 and @xmath752 km s@xmath8 clearly visible in the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 spectrum in fig .  1 .",
    "these absorptions were present in our earlier paper @xcite , but with less clarity .",
    "in the new spectrum weak and broad absorptions at lower velocities are also evident .",
    "we argue in the following that the three prominent absorption features in the ( 3 , 3 ) line arise in high temperature , low density turbulent clouds in the cmz .",
    "first , note that the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 spectrum does not show any of the sharp features that are observed in the @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 spectrum and in the @xmath47(1 ) co spectrum .",
    "note also that the co spectrum does not show the broad features of the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 spectrum beyond 2@xmath55 of 1  % .",
    "this difference can not be due to the slightly lower resolution of the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 spectrum .",
    "clearly for the most part the metastable h@xmath2 and co do not coexist .",
    "co is found in relatively high density and low temperature areas with low velocity dispersion mostly in the intervening spiral arms , while h@xmath2 in the metastable level exists in hotter , more turbulent regions in the cmz .",
    "second , note that the h@xmath2 @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 spectrum also shows the broad absorptions at @xmath7123 km s@xmath8 , @xmath797 km s@xmath8 and @xmath752 km s@xmath8 , although the @xmath752 km s@xmath8 component is overlapped by the strong and sharp line contribution from cold h@xmath2 in the 3 kpc arm .",
    "the strengths of the broad @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 and @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 absorptions at these velocities are approximately the same .",
    "since the strengths of the @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 and @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 transitions are @xmath56 = 0.01407 d@xmath57 and 0.01914 d@xmath57 , respectively , their equal intensities imply a population ratio @xmath28(3 , 3)/@xmath28(1 , 1 ) = ( 14/3 ) exp ( @xmath7361/@xmath3@xmath58 ) = 0.735 , corresponding to @xmath3@xmath58 = 195 k. because of spontaneous emission between rotational levels of h@xmath2 , the kinetic temperature of the clouds @xmath3 is at least as high as @xmath59 and is likely much higher .",
    "third , note that the h@xmath2 @xmath47(2 , 2)@xmath48 spectrum does not show any absorption near @xmath7123 km s@xmath8 and @xmath797 km s@xmath8 ( @xmath60@xmath61 @xmath62 % ) and at best a very weak absorption near @xmath752 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this demonstrates a remarkably non - thermal h@xmath2 rotational distribution in which the ( 3 , 3 ) level 361 k above the ground level is highly populated while the ( 2 , 2 ) level 151 k above ground is scarcely populated .",
    "it also shows that that the cloud density is considerably lower than the critical density for the ( 2 , 2 ) @xmath33 ( 1 , 1 ) spontaneous emission , @xmath63 @xmath4 200 @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the high temperature and low density of the clouds are established .",
    "the high negative velocities",
    "@xmath4@xmath7100 km s@xmath8 of the hot and diffuse clouds , peaking at @xmath7123 km s@xmath8 and @xmath797 km s@xmath8 , suggest that they are part of a large - scale structure moving away from the galactic center at high speed that was initially proposed as the expanding molecular ring ( emr ) by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite from the ( @xmath51-@xmath64 ) maps of oh , h@xmath23co , and co. it was later also interpreted as part of a parallelogram by @xcite and as an expanding molecular shell ( ems ) by @xcite based on the radio @xmath65co observations by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that the total co emission from the ems amounts to 15 % of the total emission from the cmz . from a large - scale co survey of the galactic center , @xcite pointed out the possibility that the emr may consist of multiple arm - features that could be associated with different lindblad resonances @xcite discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed double peak of the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 and @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 spectra in this velocity interval must provide information on this issue .",
    "it is interesting to note that some co is observed in the @xmath797 km s@xmath8 cloud but not in the @xmath7123 km s@xmath8 cloud . the small amount of co in the cold and high density areas of those clouds in the particular direction of gcs 3 - 2 ( @xmath51 = 10 and @xmath53 = @xmath74 ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) is in agreement with the observation of @xcite ( see their @xmath51-@xmath64 maps for @xmath53 = @xmath74@xmath52 on page 493 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 absorption at @xmath752 km s@xmath8 might suggest that hot and diffuse gas also exists in the ",
    "@xmath750 km s@xmath8 cloud \" that has been ascribed to the 3 kpc arm .",
    "the narrow @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 and co features at this velocity probably do arise in the arm , which merges into the corotating stars in the galactic stellar bar at about 2.4 kpc @xcite . however , the large velocity dispersion of the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 absorption component and the warm gas temperature suggest that , like the higher negative velocity @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 absorptions , it originates in the cmz .",
    "comparison of the h@xmath2 @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 spectrum with the co @xmath54 spectrum shows that in the former there is a wide and shallow absorption trough at velocities between about @xmath740 km s@xmath8 and @xmath6630 km s@xmath8 , with a depth of about two percent of the continuum .",
    "the existence of this feature was already noted in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the co spectrum returns to the continuum level between the narrow absorptions at @xmath752 , @xmath732 , @xmath75 , and @xmath6619 km s@xmath8 .",
    "separation of the trough and sharp lines in the @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 spectrum is discussed in more detail below in section 4.1 ( see fig .  4 given later ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 absorption trough is also present , but weaker in the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 spectrum and thus demonstrates the presence of diffuse clouds with little co at somewhat lower temperatures than the gas in the emr .",
    "it is difficult to determine the number and natures of the lower velocity warm clouds that contribute to the trough , because of their weak absorptions and the contamination by strong and narrow spectral features . however , some of the absorption is certainly due to the aforementioned 20 km s@xmath8 cloud and it seems probable that the remainder also is located inside the cmz ; the high velocity spread is in sharp contrast to that of h@xmath2 in many cold dense and diffuse clouds in the galactic disk which always give narrow lines @xcite .",
    "observations of many more sources distributed over a wider region of the cmz under high spectroscopic resolution will be attempted in the near future to obtain a more detailed picture of those clouds .",
    "the non - thermal distribution in the lower rotational levels of h@xmath2 has also been observed toward other infrared sources in the cmz .",
    "2 shows subaru spectra of the @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 , @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 and @xmath47(2 , 2)@xmath48 lines toward eight infrared sources . ,",

    "the locations of these sources are shown in fig .  3 superimposed on the vla 20 cm image of the galactic center by @xcite , which shows the high mhd activity in the region with both thermal and non - thermal emission .    all targets in fig .",

    "the velocities of the absorption features vary greatly from source to source . as the sightlines",
    "are separated by 1@xmath52  12@xmath52 , this provides supporting evidence that the absorbing clouds are within the cmz and not in spiral arms farther from the galactic center .",
    "thus , these observations strongly suggest that hot and diffuse gas exists widely in the cmz .",
    "of particular interest in fig .",
    "2 is the pronounced broad @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 absorption at v@xmath68 @xmath4 @xmath6650 km s@xmath8 in the spectrum of gc irs 3 , which also was noted by @xcite .",
    "the hot and diffuse gas producing this absorption apparently is a component of the  50 km s@xmath8 cloud \" , a complex of giant molecular clouds within 10 pc of the galactic nuclei @xcite that is a key to understanding sgr a and its environment @xcite . from measurements of nh@xmath15 emission and h@xmath23co absorption , @xcite and",
    "@xcite concluded that the 50 km s@xmath8 cloud is sandwiched between sgr a west in the front and sgr east in the back .",
    "this is clearly confirmed in the recent observations of cs by @xcite and the measurements of h  i by @xcite .",
    "hence gc irs 3 must be behind the 50 km s@xmath8 cloud and at least somewhat behind the galactic nucleus .",
    "the 50 km s@xmath8 component is not observed toward gc irs 1w , indicating that this source is close to or in front of the nucleus .",
    "@xcite saw similar behavior of the velocity components in fundamental band co lines ; the 50 km s@xmath8 component was observed toward gc irs 3 and gc irs 7 , but not toward gc irs 1 and gc irs 2 .",
    "they suggested , in view of the close proximity of these four sources on the plane of the sky , that the co absorption at 50 km s@xmath8 might not be due to the 50 km s@xmath8 cloud but rather to the inner edge of the circumnuclear molecular ring orbiting the nucleus at a radius of @xmath4 2 pc @xcite .",
    "the present observations , however , indicate that the absorption is likely due to the 50 km s@xmath8 cloud since one would not expect to detect such a large column density of h@xmath2 in the circumnuclear molecular ring .",
    "detailed analyses of the individual spectra in fig .",
    "2 together with many more spectral lines observed at subaru will be given in a separate paper .",
    "here we simply emphasize that the hot and diffuse clouds are distributed widely in the cmz .",
    "the large variations in velocity and density of clouds within 0.2@xmath67 of the center is not in disaccord with the co observations by @xcite ( see their @xmath51-@xmath64 maps on page 493 ) .",
    "large spatial variations in dust absorption have also been reported by @xcite .",
    "we have attempted to detect the @xmath47(3 , 3)@xmath48 line toward several dense and diffuse clouds where large column densities of h@xmath2 have previously been observed in the low - lying ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 0 ) levels , in order to determine if cold dense or diffuse clouds are surrounded by diffuse and warmer gas .",
    "we have not been able to detect the line in any of afgl 2136 and w 33a @xcite , cygnus ob2 12 @xcite , wr 118 and hd 183143 @xcite , and strs 217 and w51 irs 2 ( geballe et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "if we assume same velocity dispersion as the observed r(1 , 1)@xmath48 lines , those observations set the upper limit on the equivalent width of @xmath4 1 @xmath19 10@xmath69 @xmath41 m and the level column density of @xmath4 3 @xmath19 10@xmath65 @xmath27 .",
    "the upper limit for temperature depends on individual clouds . for cygnus ob2 12 for example , where the level column density of the ( 1 , 1 ) level is 2 @xmath19 10@xmath65 @xmath27 @xcite , this sets the upper limit of @xmath4 100 k. the hot and diffuse environments in which metastable line arises seem to be unique to sightlines toward the galactic center and , we believe , to regions within the cmz .",

    "as noted earlier , the @xmath47(1 , 1)@xmath48 spectrum is composed of sharp absorption lines due to h@xmath2 in  ordinary \" clouds coexisting with co in the intervening spiral arms , and broad absorptions consisting of features at high and intermediate negative velocities and the trough at lower velocities , all of which are thought to be in the cmz .",

    ". assumptions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) each introduce error mainly into the determination of number density .",
    "assumption ( 3 ) has three sources of error : ( a ) the assumption of completely random selection rules , ( b ) the formula given in eq.(2 ) , and ( c ) use of the langevin rate as the total collision rate .",
    "out of these three , ( c ) is most liable to introduce large overall errors .",
    "it is based on the microwave pressure broadening measurement of the hco@xmath81 - h@xmath23 collision by @xcite and the extensive experimental and theoretical studies of the collision by the group of de lucia and herbst @xcite .",
    "the latter papers show that the collision rate constant is close to the langevin rate constant of 1.5 @xmath19 10@xmath82 cm@xmath25 s@xmath8 for the temperature range 10 - 77 k both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "how well this applies to collisions of h@xmath2 , whose rotational energy separations are much larger than those of hco@xmath81 , remains to be seen . since",
    "experimental measurement of h@xmath2 pressure broadening is next to impossible , theoretical calculations are needed .",
    "better still , a theoretical calculation of state - to - state transition probabilities induced by collisions will make the model calculation more accurate since it also will eliminate errors caused by assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "if the h@xmath2 - h@xmath23 collision rate constant is much lower than the langevin rate , the number densities of the clouds determined above will be an underestimate .",
    "we believe that this error is no more than a factor of two , especially at the cloud temperatures of @xmath4250 k. since a collision rate constant for a specific transition ( @xmath83 ) @xmath33 @xmath84 , @xmath85 is proportional to the overall rate constant @xmath86 ( which we set to the langevin rate ) and is always multiplied with the cloud number density @xmath5(h@xmath23 ) , a variation of @xmath86 does not change fig",
    ". 5 except the scale of the number density changes inversely proportional to @xmath86 .    a considerable fraction of the hydrogen in the region of hot and diffuse gas may be atomic due to photodissociation of h@xmath23 , although because of the high volume density of molecular clouds in the cmz even the intercloud hydrogen may exist mainly in molecular form ( @xcite quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the polarizability of h is comparable to that of h@xmath23 ( 0.67 @xmath25 versus 0.79 @xmath25 ) , the langevin rate constants for the h@xmath2 - h and h@xmath2 - h@xmath23 collisions are comparable ( 2.2 @xmath19 10@xmath87 cm@xmath25 s@xmath8 versus 1.9 @xmath19 10@xmath82 cm@xmath25 s@xmath8 ) . therefore , as long as we interpret the cloud density @xmath5 as @xmath5(h@xmath23 ) + @xmath5(h ) , the results of paper i are a good approximation . because of the low polarizability of he ( 0.20 @xmath25 ) and the higher reduced mass , the langevin rate constant of the h@xmath2 - he collision is considerably lower ( 0.8 @xmath19 10@xmath82 cm@xmath25 s@xmath8 ) and its effect is negligible .",
    "thus , we believe that our derivation of low cloud densities , on the order of 100 @xmath6 , is secure .",
    "our derived high temperatures are less affected by the model calculation since they are based on the high energy of the ( 3 , 3 ) metastable level , unless there is some special pumping mechanism to influence the non - thermal distribution .",
    "we have not been able to find such a mechanism . unlike in h@xmath23 or c@xmath23 ,",
    "optical pumping is inconceivable since h@xmath2 does not have stable electronic excited state .",
    "infrared pumping is very unlikely since the h@xmath2 vibrational transitions are isolated in the middle of the l window from transitions of other ( abundant ) molecules .",
    "collisional pumping by the @xmath0 = 2 @xmath33 0 transition of h@xmath23 at 510 k may discriminate between the ( 3 , 3 ) and ( 2 , 2 ) levels to some extent , but is unlikely to cause such a drastically non - thermal population as is observed .",
    "according to the model calculation of paper i , the ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) and ( 3 , 3 ) rotational levels contain most of the h@xmath2 population , with only a very small fraction of the h@xmath2 in the ( 2 , 2 ) level at the temperatures and densities listed in table 3",
    ". the higher metastable levels ( 4 , 4 ) , ( 5 , 5 ) , and ( 6 , 6 ) contain a small but non - negligible fraction of the population . from fig . 5 of paper i we estimate the total column densities in those three metastable levels to be 1.4 @xmath19 10@xmath88 @xmath27 , 0.4 @xmath19 10@xmath88 @xmath27 , and 0.1 @xmath19 10@xmath88 @xmath27 , for the @xmath7100 km s@xmath8 , @xmath750 km s@xmath8 , and 0 km s@xmath8 clouds , respectively .",
    "the total h@xmath2 column density toward gcs 3 - 2 including the cold clouds in spiral arms is obtained by summing the total column densities of the ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) and ( 2 , 2 ) levels given at the bottom of table 2 , the total h@xmath2 column density for the ( 1 , 0 ) level of ( 12.1 @xmath79 1.5 ) @xmath19 10@xmath88 @xmath27 determined from the @xmath78(1 , 0 ) line ( see table 3 of @xcite ) , and the column density of the high metastable levels estimated above , ( 1.9 @xmath79 0.5 ) @xmath19 10@xmath88 @xmath27 .",

    "the visual extinction toward gcs 3 - 2 is calculated to be @xmath30 @xmath4 30 mag from fig .",
    "20 of @xcite .",
    "how much of this extinction is due to dense ( @xmath90 10@xmath91 @xmath6 ) clouds and how much to diffuse clouds is not known .",
    "if the ratio is like that toward the infrared sources near sgr a * , i.e. , 1 : 2 @xcite , the visible extinction of a@xmath92 @xmath4 10 mag inferred for dense clouds implies only a marginally detectable h@xmath2 column density if that extinction arises in the kind of dense cloud cores in which h@xmath2 has been found previously .",
    "this is because , as pointed out in section 1 , the h@xmath2 column density per unit extinction in dense cores is 10 times smaller than in diffuse clouds .",
    "we note however , that dense clouds encountered in spiral arms along the line of sight are likely to be less dense than the ones in which h@xmath2 has been found to date . as the number density of h@xmath2 is constant in dark clouds @xcite , such lower density  dense clouds \" may contain considerably more h@xmath2 per unit extinction . thus we can not constrain the cloud environment of the cold h@xmath2 outside of the cmz .",
    "observations toward many more sightlines covering a wider regions of the cmz are needed in order to elucidate the natures of the hot and diffuse clouds in the cmz besides their temperatures and densities .",
    "nevertheless , we can speculate on some physical and chemical properties of the clouds based on the data obtained so far and on the understanding of h@xmath2 in the diffuse interstellar medium gained from our previous studies .",
    "one of the salient properties of h@xmath2 as an astrophysical probe is the simplicity and generality of its chemistry .",
    "this allows us to express its number density in diffuse clouds in terms of the number densities of h@xmath23 and electron as @xmath5(h@xmath2 ) = ( @xmath93/@xmath94)[@xmath5(h@xmath23)/@xmath5(e ) ] , where @xmath93 is the ionization rate of h@xmath23 and @xmath94 is the rate constant for dissociative recombination of h@xmath2 with electrons @xcite .",

    "this conclusion is not surprising since h@xmath2 is a more sensitive probe for diffuse clouds than for dense clouds ( in terms of column density of h@xmath2 per unit extinction ; see section 1 ) , and that the extinction toward the gc is mostly due to diffuse clouds .",
    "it shows , however , that the amount of dense cloud material in the cmz is much less than previously thought .",
    "if indeed the cmz contains high density gas ( @xmath10 10@xmath16 @xmath6 ) with a high volume filling factor ( @xmath10 0.1 ) as mentioned in @xcite , we would have easily detected h@xmath2 .",

    "that combination gives a mass of the gas in the cmz which is much higher than 5 - 10 @xmath19 10@xmath114 @xmath115 estimated from radio observations of molecules ( see many references quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "more recent papers of @xcite and @xcite , using co @xmath0 = 2 - 1 and cs @xmath0 = 1 - 0 lines have reported mass values of 2 @xmath19 10@xmath114 @xmath115 ( as a lower limit ) and 3 - 8 @xmath19 10@xmath114 @xmath115 , respectively . also the large dense cloud path length of 20 pc would give a visual extinction at least an order of magnitude higher than @xmath30 = 25 - 40 reported by @xcite for four large regions within 40 pc of the galactic center .",
    "out of many molecular emissions used to study the cmz , the 1 - 0 emission line of co and inversion spectrum of nh@xmath15 can not provide evidence for dense clouds by themselves since their critical densities are lower than 10@xmath16 @xmath6 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the co 2 - 1 @xcite and higher @xcite emission lines and the 1 - 0 emission lines of cs @xcite , hcn and hco@xmath81 @xcite do provide definitive evidence for high density clouds .",
    "also , high densities in the cmz have been reported from radio absorption of hcn and cs using model calculations @xcite .",
    "however the filling factor of these clouds is probably much lower than 0.1 , more likely 0.01 or even less .",
    "( in this regard the observation of broad _ absorption _ by hco@xmath81 by @xcite is noteworthy ) .",
    "the fraction of @xmath4 10 % quoted as the ratio of gas in the cmz to the total gas content of the galaxy ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) must also be a gross overestimate .",
    "we have observed three absorption lines of h@xmath2 towards several infrared sources in the galactic center , indicating the presence of extensive hot and diffuse clouds with high velocity dispersions in the inner 200 pc central molecular zone of the galaxy .",
    "the observed high column densities of h@xmath2 in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) = ( 3 , 3 ) metastable rotational level , which is 361 k above the ( 1 , 1 ) ground level , provides definitive evidence of the high temperature , and the absence or small quantity in the ( 2 , 2 ) level , which is 210 k lower than the ( 3 , 3 ) level , provides evidence for the low density of these clouds .",
    "this remarkable non - thermal rotational distribution is caused by the metastability of the ( 3 , 3 ) level and the relatively fast spontaneous emission from ( 2 , 2 ) to ( 1 , 1 ) . the hot and diffuse gas toward the brightest infrared source gcs 3 - 2 in the quintuplet cluster has been quantitatively studied .",
    "we estimate that three - fourths of the total h@xmath2 column density of 4.3 @xmath19 10@xmath89 @xmath27 observed towards this source arises in the cmz , with half of this fraction associated with the 180 pc radius expanding molecular ring , and the remainder in lower velocity clouds .",
    "these clouds have a range of temperatures and densities , with all of the temperatures considerably higher than diffuse clouds in the galactic disk where the ( 3 , 3 ) level has not been detected .",
    "the remaining one - fourth of the observed h@xmath2 is located outside the cmz , largely in spiral arms along the line of sight to the nucleus .    in order to make the aggregate line of sight pathlength of the diffuse cmz gas a reasonable value ,",
    "it is necessary to assume a very high ionization rate @xmath93 = ( 2 - 7 ) @xmath19 10@xmath106 s@xmath8 .",
    "the high metallicity in the cmz is only partly responsible for the need for the large increase of @xmath93 over its value elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "the high value is no doubt intimately related to the exceptionally energetic environment of the galactic center .",
    "almost all of h@xmath2 in the cmz exists in low density clouds .",
    "the filling factor of high density clouds in the cmz , @xmath9 @xmath10 0.1 , that has been reported previously , must be a considerable overestimate .",
    "questions abound on the hot and diffuse clouds in the cmz .",
    "how are they related to dense clouds studied by neutral molecules and the h  ii regions studied by hydrogen recombination lines ? what is their relation to the sources of x - ray emission and to the strong magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in the nucleus ?",
    "what is their heating mechanism ?",
    "how is the pressure balanced ?",
    "additional observations of h@xmath2 and co toward other infrared stars in the cmz including those at larger distances from the galactic nuclei may help provide answers to some of these questions .",
    "we thank the staffs of subaru , gemini , and the joint astronomy centre for their support of these observations .",
    "we are grateful to t. nagata for providing us information on the suitability of the nhs stars for the h@xmath2 observations , and to c. lang for giving us the h  i radio spectrum of the sickle prior to publication .",
