    "providing a mechanism to generate the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations that later on in the history of the universe source the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the large scale structure is one of the strongest points in favour of inflation @xcite .",
    "the calculation of this spectrum is a crucial tool in studying the early universe and inflation . instead of following the evolution of the field perturbations",
    "directly it is easier to relate them to conserved quantities which are constant in time on super - horizon scales , such as the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces , @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to side - step unresolved issues of inflationary cosmology such as the decay of the scalar field(s ) driving inflation into the standard model particles , and directly relate the epoch when the primordial density spectrum is generated to the epoch of structure formation after the perturbations reenter the horizon",
    ".    conserved quantities , such as @xmath0 , will only be constant on super - horizon scales and in the very simplest cases such as slow - roll single field inflation , and will evolve in others such as multi - field or non slow - roll inflation .",
    "the evolution equation for the curvature perturbation @xmath0 follows directly from the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite , and can be written on large scales as [ eq : zetadotlarge ] = - , where @xmath1 is the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation which we shall study in detail below .",
    "hence @xmath0 will be constant if @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the non - adiabatic pressure can be used to generate or amplify the curvature perturbation , which is exploited in the curvaton mechanism @xcite .",
    "there has been a lot of recent interest in scalar fields with non - canonical actions .",
    "early work in the realm of the early universe included that of k - inflation @xcite , and more current work includes that of the string theory motivated dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation @xcite .",
    "scalar fields with non - canonical actions have also recently been considered as dark energy candidates ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we study here if and under what conditions the curvature perturbation @xmath0 , remains constant on large , super - horizon scales , for a scalar field system derived from a general , non - canonical action .",
    "we focus on the classical aspects of the system , which allows us to treat the scalar fields as a non - standard perfect fluid . for aspects of quantisation and a more field - centred view see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the letter is organised as follows : in the next section we study thermodynamic relations between the pressure , energy density and entropy of the system .",
    "this is followed by a discussion regarding the adiabatic sound speed and phase speed of a system . in section [ sec : equations ] we give the governing equations for the non - canonical scalar field system , both in the background and to first order in the perturbations and describe specific examples of adiabatic sound speed and phase speeds . in section [ sec : conditions ] we present conditions for the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation to vanish , and we conclude the letter with a short discussion in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this letter we assume a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background spacetime and use coordinate time , @xmath3 . derivatives with respect to coordinate time are denoted by a dot .",
    "greek indices , @xmath4 , run from @xmath5 , while lower - case latin indices , @xmath6 , take the value @xmath7 , or @xmath8 .",
    "considerable physical insight can be gained by studying the thermodynamic properties of a system . in order to keep the discussion as simple as possible , we focus here on a single fluid system . for an analysis including an arbitrary number of interacting fluids and canonical fields see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a general thermodynamic system is fully characterised by three variables , of which only two are independent . here",
    "we choose the energy density @xmath9 , and the entropy @xmath10 , as independent variables , with the pressure @xmath11 being @xmath12 .",
    "the pressure perturbation can then be expanded into a taylor series as [ eq : dp ] = s + .",
    "this can be cast in the more familiar form [ defdpnad ] = + , by introducing the adiabatic sound speed [ defcs2 ] .|_s , and by identifying the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : dp ] ) and ( [ defdpnad ] ) provide an intuitive and convenient definition for the adiabatic and the entropy , or non - adiabatic , perturbations in our system : the single adiabatic degree of freedom is proportional to the energy density , all other degrees of freedom will contribute to the non - adiabatic perturbation .",
    "this definition can easily be extended to more than two degrees of freedom as we shall show below , and can also be extended to higher order in the perturbations , as we shall briefly demonstrate at the end of this section .    with the above definitions , we see from eq .",
    "( [ defdpnad ] ) that the adiabatic sound speed @xmath14 is of zeroth order in the perturbations , and since all background quantities depend only on time we get from eq .",
    "( [ defcs2 ] ) [ cs2back ] = , where subscript `` 0 '' denotes a background quantity .",
    "together with the behaviour of @xmath15 and @xmath16 under a gauge - transformation @xmath17 , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , only the definition for the sound speed @xmath14 given in eq .",
    "( [ cs2back ] ) renders the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation @xmath1 gauge - invariant .",
    "we now focus on a system with two degrees of freedom . in order to obtain the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation in terms of different variables , we simply change from @xmath9 and @xmath11 to the new variables denoted here @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which we shall identify in the following section with the amplitude of the scalar field and its kinetic term , respectively . the energy density and the pressure are then functions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that is @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and we can therefore write [ eq : dp1 ] = + x , and [ eq : drho ] = + x . substituting eqs .",

    "( [ eq : nad ] ) the terms in brackets are of zeroth order , and hence @xmath25 can be evaluated once @xmath26 has been specified using background quantities only , which we shall do below in section [ sec : conditions ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nad ] ) can readily be extended to more than two degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , if the energy density and the pressure are functions of @xmath27 fields @xmath28 and @xmath21 , that is @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then [ eq : nad : mult ] p_nad = _ k_,_k ( -)_k + _ , x(-)x .    to extend eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp ] ) to higher order we simply do not truncate the taylor expansion at the linear order , that is [ eq : dp2 ] = s + + +  .",
    "the entropy , or non - adiabatic pressure perturbation at second order , for example , is then found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp2 ] ) , and expanding @xmath31 , and similarly @xmath16 , we get @xcite p_2nad = p_2-_1-  _ 1 ^ 2 . after this higher order excursion , we return to linear theory below .",
    "many oscillating systems can be described by a wave equation , that is a second order evolution equation of the form [ eq : wave_equ ] -^2+f(,)=0 , where @xmath32 is , for example , the velocity potential or the scalar field amplitude , @xmath33 is the damping term , and @xmath34 is the phase speed , i.e.  the speed with which perturbations travel through the system @xcite .",
    "there is some confusion in the literature on the meaning of adiabatic sound speed and phase speed .",
    "although this seems not to affect the results of previous works , and the adiabatic sound speed is often simply used as a convenient shorthand for @xmath35 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ cs2back ] ) , it is often confusingly used to denote the phase speed .",
    "we take the opportunity to clarify these issues here .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed defined above describes the response of the pressure to a change in density at constant entropy , , which describes the change in density due to a change in pressure while keeping the entropy constant .",
    "] and is the speed with which pressure perturbations travels through a classical fluid .",
    "a collection of scalar fields can also be described as fluid , but the analogy is not exact .",
    "whereas in the fluid case phase speed @xmath34 and adiabatic sound speed @xmath14 are equal , this is not true in the scalar field case and the speed with which perturbations travel is given _ only _ by @xmath34 .",
    "we shall illustrate the difference in @xmath34 and @xmath14 for a concrete example in section [ sec : speeds ] below .",
    "we now derive the governing equations for a scalar field system with general non - canonical action .",

    "the friedmann constraint equation is given by h^2= , where @xmath52 is the hubble parameter .",
    "conservation of energy - momentum to linear order gives the perturbed energy conservation equation [ eq : fluidevolution ] = -3h(+)+(_0+p_0 ) .",
    "this can be readily rewritten in terms of the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces @xmath53 , and working in the uniform density gauge , where @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we get @xcite [ eq : zetadot ] = -(+v ) .",

    "if we are interested in the speed with which perturbations travel through the system , we have to calculate the phase speed , which can be read off from the perturbed klein - gordon equation governing the evolution of the scalar field .",

    "the adiabatic sound speed reduces to [ eq : csstandard ] = 1 + , and becomes @xmath64 in slow - roll .",
    "the phase speed for a canonical scalar field is @xmath65",
    "we now return to the question of under what conditions the non - adiabatic pressure in a general scalar field system vanishes . the non - adiabatic pressure @xmath1 for the system ( [ eq : lagrangian ] )",

    "therefore , the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation @xmath1 for the general action ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) vanishes in the large scale limit without the need to impose any further conditions , just as in the canonical case @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this is at first glance a surprising result , since one might assume that the system has two degrees of freedom , @xmath60 and @xmath59 , and that one would need to impose slow - roll to `` switch off '' a degree of freedom in order to obtain zero non - adiabatic pressure .    yet , in the super - horizon limit @xmath66 , such a condition is not necessary since the constraint equation ( [ x_vp_rel ] ) eliminates one degree of freedom .    for multiple scalar fields , however , this equation does not hold , and hence @xmath1 is , in general , non - zero .",
    "+ if we study specific models , for example the dbi inflation models of refs .",
    "@xcite , and loosen the super - horizon limit @xmath66 by instead studying small but non - zero wavenumbers @xmath67 , we can calculate the possible small deviation from zero of the non - adiabatic pressure or entropy perturbation .",
    "this is an additional observational constraint which can be imposed on the models , and which is already strongly constrained by the data @xcite . since these issues are outside the aim of this work , we will discuss them in detail in a forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "we have studied whether the curvature perturbation in a system with a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with non - canonical action is constant on super - horizon scales .",
    "deriving the adiabatic and the non - adiabatic or entropy perturbation we found that imposing the strict super - horizon limit @xmath68 is sufficient to guarantee conservation of @xmath0 and hence of the primordial power spectrum , just as in the canonical case .    the non - adiabatic pressure , or entropy , perturbation is in general non - zero , if there is more than one degree of freedom in the system , as is the case in multi - field systems .",
    "in this case the curvature perturbation evolves , even on large scales , and it is necessary to solve the evolution equations of the scalar fields to construct the non - adiabatic pressure .",
    "however , it is then more efficient to construct @xmath0 directly using its definition and substituting in the energy densities in terms of the fields , instead of first constructing @xmath1 and then solving the evolution equation for @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetadot ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "we have also highlighted the difference between the phase speed and the adiabatic sound speed of a system in section [ sec : speeds ] . although these are the same in classical fluid systems , they are different in the scalar field models studied here , with only the phase speed describing the speed with which perturbations travel .",
    "we emphasise that only the definition for the adiabatic sound speed , eq .",
    "( [ cs2back ] ) , enters the gauge - transformation of the pressure perturbation , as pointed out in section [ sec : entropy ] .",
