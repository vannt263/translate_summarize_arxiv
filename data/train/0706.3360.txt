    "_ , 1995 ) has in fact opened new stimulating perspectives in this area of research .",
    "most of the studies in the first years have been devoted to quantum gases of bosonic nature and were aimed to investigate the important consequences of bose - einstein condensation which , before 1995 , had remained an elusive and inaccessible phenomenon .",
    "major achievements of these studies have been , among others , the investigation of superfluid features , including the hydrodynamic nature of the collective oscillations ( jin _ et al .",

    "_ , 2006 ; schweikhard , tung and cornell , 2007 ) .    on the theoretical side the first efforts were devoted to implement the gross - pitaevskii theory of weakly interacting bose gases in the presence of the trapping conditions of experimental interest .",
    "this non - linear , mean - field theory has proven capable to account for most of the relevant experimentally measured quantities in bose - einstein condensed gases like density profiles , collective oscillations , structure of vortices etc .",
    "the attention of theorists was later focused also on phenomena which can not be accounted for by the mean - field description like , for example , the role of correlations in low dimensional and in fast rotating configurations as well as in deep optical lattices ( for general reviews on bose - einstein condensed gases see inguscio , stringari and wieman , 1999 ; dalfovo _ et al . _ , 1999 ; leggett , 2001 ; pethick and smith , 2002 ; pitaevskii and stringari , 2003 ) .    very soon",
    "the attention of experimentalists and theorists was also oriented towards the study of fermi gases .",
    "the main motivations for studying fermionic systems are in many respects complementary to the bosonic case .",
    "quantum statistics plays a major role at low temperature .",
    "although the relevant temperature scale providing the onset of quantum degeneracy is the same in both cases , being of the order of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gas density and @xmath4 is the mass of the atoms , the physical consequences of quantum degeneracy are different . in the bose case",
    "quantum statistical effects are associated with the occurrence of a phase transition to the bose - einstein condensed phase .",
    "conversely , in a non - interacting fermi gas the quantum degeneracy temperature only corresponds to a smooth crossover between a classical and a quantum behavior .",
    "differently from the bose case the occurrence of a superfluid phase in a fermi gas can be only due to the presence of interactions . from the many - body point of view",
    "the study of fermi superfluidity opens a different and richer class of questions which will be discussed in this review paper .",
    "another important difference between bose and fermi gases concerns the collisional processes .",
    "in particular , in a single component fermi gas @xmath0-wave scattering is inhibited due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this effect has dramatic consequences on the cooling mechanisms based on evaporation , where thermalization plays a crucial role .",
    "this has made the achievement of low temperatures in fermi gases a difficult goal that was eventually realized with the use of sympathetic cooling techniques either employing two different spin components of the same fermi gas or adding a bose gas component as a refrigerant .",
    "first important achievements of quantum degeneracy in trapped fermi gases were obtained by the group at jila ( de marco and jin , 1999 ) . in these experiments temperatures of the order of fractions of the fermi temperatures",
    "were reached by working with two spin components of @xmath5k atoms interacting with negative scattering length . according to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory",
    "this gas should exhibit superfluidity at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "however , due to the extreme diluteness of the gas , the critical temperature required to enter the superfluid phase was too small in these experiments .",
    "quantum degeneracy effects were later observed in @xmath6li fermi gases ( truscott et al . , 2001 ; schreck et al . , 2001 ) using sympathetic cooling between @xmath6li and the bosonic @xmath7li isotope .",
    "fermion cooling using different bosonic species has also proved very efficient for instance in the case of @xmath5k-@xmath8rb ( roati _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) as well as @xmath6li-@xmath9na ( hadzibabic _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) .",
    "it was soon realized that a crucial tool to achieve superfluidity is provided by the availability of feshbach resonances .",
    "these resonances characterize the two body interaction and permit one to change the value and even the sign of the scattering length by simply tuning an external magnetic field .",
    "feshbach resonances were first investigated in bosonic sytems ( courteille _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; inouye _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "however , inelastic processes severely limit the possibility of tuning the interaction in bose condensates ( stenger _ et al . _ , 1999 ) .",
    "strongly interacting regimes of fermionic atoms were achieved by ohara _",
    "( 2002 ) and bourdel _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) working at the resonance where the scattering length takes a divergent value .",
    "in this case three - body losses are inhibited by the pauli exclusion principle , leading to a greater stability of the gas ( petrov , salomon and shlyapnikov , 2004 ) .",
    "the resonant regime , also called unitary regime , is very peculiar since the gas is at the same time dilute ( in the sense that the range of the interatomic potential is much smaller than the interparticle distance ) and strongly interacting ( in the sense that the scattering length is much larger than the interparticle distance ) .",
    "all the length scales associated with interactions disappear from the problem and the system is expected to exhibit a universal behavior , independent of the details of the interatomic potential .",
    "bertsch ( 1999 ) and baker ( 1999 ) first discussed the unitary regime as a model for neutron matter based on resonance effects in the neutron - neutron scattering amplitude ( for a recent comparison between cold atoms and neutron matter see gezerlis and carlson , 2007 ) .",
    "the critical temperature of the new system is much higher than in the bcs regime , being of the order of the quantum degeneracy temperature , which makes the realization of the superfluid phase much easier .",
    "thanks to feshbach resonances one can also tune the scattering length to positive and small values . here ,",
    "bound dimers composed of atoms of different spin are formed and consequently the system , that was originally a fermi gas , is transformed into a bosonic gas of molecules .",
    "the possibility of tuning the scattering length across the resonance from negative to positive values , and vice - versa , provides a continous connection between the physics of fermi superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation , including the unitary gas as an intermediate regime .    on the bec side of the feshbach resonance molecules",
    "can be created either by directly cooling the gas at positive values of the scattering length @xmath10 , or by first cooling the gas on the bcs side and then tuning the value of @xmath10 through the resonance . at low enough temperatures , bose - einstein condensation of pairs of atoms",
    "was observed through the typical bimodal distribution of the molecular profiles ( see fig .  [ fig1.1 ] ) ( greiner , regal and jin , 2003 ; jochim _ et al . _ 2003 ; zwierlein _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; bourdel _ et al . _ , 2004 ; partridge _ et al . _ ,",
    "condensation of pairs was later measured also on the fermionic side of the resonance ( regal , greiner and jin , 2004b ; zwierlein _ et al . _ , 2004 ) .",
    "other important experiments have investigated the surprisingly long lifetime of these interacting fermi gases ( strecker , partridge and hulet , 2003 ; cubizolles _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) , the release energy ( bourdel _ et al . _ , 2004 ) and the density profiles ( bartenstein _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004a ) along the crossover .",

    "_ , 2004 ) , although nicely confirming at low temperatures the predictions of the hydrodynamic theory of superfluids , can not be however considered a proof of superfluidity since a similar behavior is prediced also in the collisional regime of a normal gas above the critical temperature .",
    "the measurement of the pairing gap observed in radio - frequency excitation spectra ( chin _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) was an important step toward the experimental evidence of superfluidity , even though it was not conclusive since pairing correlations are present also in the normal phase .",
    "a convincing proof of superfluidity was actually provided by the observation of quantized vortices which were realized on both sides of the feshbach resonance ( zwierlein _ et al . _ , 2005b ) .",

    "a simple theoretical approach for trapped systems is based on the bcs mean - field treatment introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec5.1 ] and on the local density approximation ( viverit _ et al . _ , 2004 ) .",

    "the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic functions in a trapped gas along the crossover has been calculated in a series of papers using self - consistent many - body approaches ( perali _ et al .",

    "a major difficulty in the study of the thermodynamic functions is the determination of the temperature when one cools down the system into the deeply degenerate regime .",
    "in fact , when the system is very cold the measurement of the density profile in the tails , which in general provides a natural access to @xmath69 , is not accurate , the number of thermally excited atoms being small .",

    "the value of @xmath71 was determined by identifying a characteristic change of slope of the measured energy as a function of temperature and relied on a model - dependent temperature calibration .    in order to overcome the difficulties of the direct measurement of the temperature , recent experiments have also focused on the study of relevant thermodynamic relationships .",
    "one of these experiments concerns the verification of the virial relation at unitarity ( thomas , kinast and turlapov , 2005 ) that has been achieved by measuring independently the mean - square radius , proportional to the oscillator energy , and the total energy .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig6.6 ] demonstrate that the virial relation is verified with remarkable accuracy , confirming the universality of the equation of state at unitarity .",
    "another experiment concerns the measurement of the entropy of the trapped gas ( luo _ et al .",
    ". in this experiment one starts from a strongly interacting configuration ( for example at unitarity ) and switches off adiabatically the interactions bringing the system into a final weakly interacting state , where the measurement of the radii ( and hence of the oscillator energy ) is expected to provide a reliable determination of the entropy .",
    "since entropy is conserved during the transformation , the measurement of the radii of the final ( weakly interacting ) sample determines the entropy of the initial ( strongly interacting ) configuration .",

    "let us also emphasize that the hydrodynamic equations of superfluids have the same form both for bose and fermi systems , the effects of statistics entering only the form of @xmath87 .",

    "the experimental data are very well reproduced by the solutions of the equations of irrotational hydrodynamics ( solid and dotted line ) .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the same behavior for the aspect ratio is found not only in the superfluid regime but also above the critical temperature , revealing that even in the normal phase the dynamics of the expansion is described by the equations of irrotational hydrodynamics .",
    "the reason is that viscosity effects are very small in the normal phase and that the relevant time scales in this experiment are too short to generate a rigid component in the velocity field .",

    "are produced by spinning the atomic cloud with a laser beam and are observed by imaging the released cloud of molecules , which are stabilized through a rapid sweep of the scattering length to small and positive values during the first ms of the expansion .",
    "this technique , which is similar to the one employed to measure the condensate fraction of pairs ( see sec .",
    "[ sec5.2 ] ) , increases the contrast of the vortex cores and therefore their visibility .",

    "the angular momentum carried by the vortex is given by the expression @xmath298 holding if the vortex line coincides with the symmetry axis of the density profile .",
    "if the vortex is displaced towards the periphery of a trapped gas the angular momentum takes a smaller value . in this case the axial symmetry of the problem is lost and the order parameter can not be written in the form ( [ deltaphi ] ) .",

    "the above estimate shows that in the thomas - fermi regime , @xmath310 , the critical frequency is much smaller than the radial trapping frequency , thereby suggesting that vortices should be easily produced in slowly rotating traps .",
    "this conclusion , however , does not take into account the fact that the nucleation of vortices is strongly inhibited at low angular velocities by the occurrence of a barrier .",
    "for example in rotating bose - einstein condensates it has been experimentally shown that it is possible to increase the angular velocity of the trap up to values higher than @xmath304 without generating vortical states . under these conditions",
    "the response of the superfluid is governed by the equations of irrotational hydrodynamics ( see sec .",

    "a challenging problem concerns the visibility of the vortex lines . due to the smallness of the healing length , especially at unitarity ,",

    "the order parameter is exponentially small and the density profile is practically unaffected by the presence of the vortex .    the explicit behavior of the density near the vortex line as well as the precise calculation of the vortex energy requires the implementation of a microscopic calculation .",
    "this can be carried out following the lines of the mean - field bcs theory developed in sec .",

    "the vortices form thus a regular lattice even if the average density is not uniform as happens in the presence of harmonic trapping .",

    "this precession phenomenon has been already observed in the case of bose - einstein condensates containing quantized vortex lines ( chevy , madison and dalibard , 2000 ) . for a single vortex line",
    "this experiment gives direct access to the quantization of the angular momentum ( [ lv ] ) carried by the vortex , in analogy with the famous vinen experiment of superfluid helium ( vinen , 1961 ) .    in the presence of many vortex lines",
    "the collective oscillations of the system can be calculated using the equations of rotational hydrodynamics ( cozzini and stringari , 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , from a macroscopic point of view , the vortex lattice behaves like a classical body rotating in a rigid way .",
    "for example , in the case of axisymmetric configurations one finds the result @xmath337 for the frequencies of the two @xmath170 quadrupole modes , which is consistent with the sum - rule result ( [ 33f ] ) for the splitting in the case of a rigid rotation .",

    "[ sec7.3 ] ) .",
    "it is finally worth noticing that the achievement of the centrifugal limit for a superfluid containing a vortex lattice can not be ensured on the bcs side of the resonance .",
    "in fact , due to the bulge effect ( [ bulge ] ) , the centrifugal limit is associated with a strong decrease of the density and hence , for @xmath342 , with an exponential decrease of the order parameter @xmath290 .",

    "<S> the physics of quantum degenerate atomic fermi gases in uniform as well as in harmonically trapped configurations is reviewed from a theoretical perspective . emphasis is given to the effect of interactions which play a crucial role , bringing the gas into a superfluid phase at low temperature . in these dilute systems interactions are characterized by a single parameter , the @xmath0-wave scattering length , whose value can be tuned using an external magnetic field near a broad feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the bcs limit of ordinary fermi superfluidity , the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of dimers and the unitary limit of large scattering length are important regimes exhibited by interacting fermi gases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the bec and the unitary regimes are characterized by a high value of the superfluid critical temperature , of the order of the fermi temperature . </S>",
    "<S> different physical properties are discussed , including the density profiles and the energy of the ground - state configurations , the momentum distribution , the fraction of condensed pairs , collective oscillations and pair breaking effects , the expansion of the gas , the main thermodynamic properties , the behavior in the presence of optical lattices and the signatures of superfluidity , such as the existence of quantized vortices , the quenching of the moment of inertia and the consequences of spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> various theoretical approaches are considered , ranging from the mean - field description of the bcs - bec crossover to non - perturbative methods based on quantum monte carlo techniques . </S>",
    "<S> a major goal of the review is to compare the theoretical predictions with the available experimental results .     as a function of the interaction strength along the bcs - bec crossover , calculated using bcs mean - field theory ( from s de melo , randeria and engelbrecht , 1993 ) . </S>",
