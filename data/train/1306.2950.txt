    "an important frontier in the study of very high redshift galaxies remains the study of their stellar populations .",

    "quantifying the dependence of @xmath0 on both cosmic time and as a function of other quantities like luminosity or stellar mass has been very revealing .",

    "given the noteworthy contrast of the dunlop et al .",
    "( 2013 ) @xmath0 results with previous results , it seems clear that an independent analysis of the hudf12 and other deep field observations is required to further clarify the situation .",
    "fortunately , there is now a considerable amount of additional information we can utilize , beyond that already considered in previous work , to obtain the best possible constraints on the mean value of @xmath0 for faint @xmath10 - 8 galaxies .",
    "for example , while the hudf provides the highest quality information on @xmath0 for faint @xmath10 - 8 galaxies , the numbers are still small and there is also high - quality information on the @xmath0 distribution for the faintest @xmath10 galaxies from the two parallel fields to the hudf , hudf09 - 1 and hudf09 - 2 ( hereinafter , referred to as hudf09-ps ) , that have thus far not been exploited . while both of these fields have very deep @xmath31 and @xmath32-band observations , dunlop et al .",
    "( 2013 ) did not use the faintest sources from these fields to avoid concerns about potential systematic biases which they suggest could be present without the addition of deep imaging in a fourth wfc3/ir band f140w .",
    "fortunately , as we will demonstrate (  4.2 ) , there are techniques to avoid such systematic biases .    in addition , the availability of new ultra - deep wfc3/ir data , and deeper reductions of the acs data from the extreme deep field ( xdf ) effort ( illingworth et al .  2013 ) , over the hubble ultra - deep field ( hereinafter we refer to this data set as the xdf ) make it possible to obtain even more precise determinations of the @xmath18-continuum slopes @xmath0 for galaxies at @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath12 . together with the much greater wavelength leverage and sample sizes available for galaxies at these redshifts and significant gains in depth ( e.g. , @xmath33 deeper observations in the @xmath34 band : ellis et al .",
    "2013 ) , the increasingly accurate measures of the mean @xmath0 s at @xmath1 - 6 allow for very precise constraints on how the mean @xmath0 evolves towards early times .",
    "finally , given the existence of several significant compilations of @xmath0 measurements in the literature ( bouwens et al .",
    "2012 ; finkelstein et al .  2012 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2013 ) , we are able to perform extensive intercomparisons with previous measurements of @xmath0 to obtain the broadest possible perspective on where systematic biases may have affected @xmath0 measurements in the past and as cross checks on our own results .",
    "this is the first time such extensive intercomparisons have been made . as we will demonstrate in  5 , they are essential for resolving the current debate on the @xmath18-continuum slopes at high redshift .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to utilize the ultra - deep observations from the xdf and other programs to provide an independent assessment of the mean @xmath0 for faint galaxies at @xmath10 - 9 and also at @xmath1 - 6 . to ensure that our improved constraints on @xmath0 at @xmath10 are as robust as possible , we introduce a new method for fully leveraging the faintest galaxies in existing legacy data sets while remaining robust against systematic biases resulting from noise .",

    "reductions of these data use multidrizzle ( koekemoer et al .",

    "these deeper optical observations are important for ensuring that any lower - redshift interlopers in our samples are kept to a minimum to the faint - end limit of the xdf observations and also for improving the @xmath0 measurements we make for faint @xmath1 - 5 galaxies .",
    "the other deep data set , reaching to nearly hudf depths , consists of the very deep optical and near - ir observations over the two hudf09 parallel fields hudf09 - 1 and hudf09 - 2 ( bouwens et al .",

    ".    finally , the shallower , but wide - area data sets , crucial for the rarer , brighter sources , are the optical / acs and near - ir wfc3/ir observations over the candels deep region of the goods south ( all 10 epochs ) , the candels deep region of the goods north ( all 10 epochs ) , and ers field is made , including the full @xmath53 observations where available ( see bouwens et al .",

    "we utilize only those areas where @xmath54 orbits of wfc3/ir observations are available in both the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands to ensure a sufficient number of exposures to obtain a good reduction of the 50% splits of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 data .",
    "we also only utilize those areas where wfc3/ir @xmath55 observations have been acquired .",
    "the availability of @xmath55-band observations over these fields is useful both for obtaining more accurate constraints on the redshifts of the sources under study and for making it possible to largely detect and select sources , without significant reliance on deep data in other bands like the @xmath31 band .",

    "corrections for foreground dust extinction from our galaxy are performed based on the schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) maps .",
    "our procedure for constructing catalogs and doing photometry for sources in our fields is similar to much of our previous work ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "briefly , we run sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in dual - image mode , taking the detection images to be the square root of a @xmath56 image ( szalay et al .",
    "1997 : similar to a coadded image ) and using the psf - matched images for photometry .",
    "the @xmath56 image is constructed from the wfc3/ir bands where we expect sources to be significantly detected ( except in cases where it would bias our @xmath0 measurements : see  3.1 and  4.3 ) .",
    "colors are measured in small scalable apertures using a kron ( 1980 ) factor of 1.2 .",
    "typical effective radii for these small scalable apertures are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath10 sources from the xdf with @xmath4927 mag , @xmath4928.5 mag , and @xmath4929.5 mag , respectively .",
    "fluxes in these small scalable apertures are then corrected to total fluxes by ( 1 ) accounting for the additional flux in a larger scalable aperture ( kron factor 2.5 ) over that in a smaller scalable aperture ( computed from the square root of @xmath56 image ) and ( 2 ) by correcting for the light on the wings of the psf based on the tabulated encircled energy distribution ( table 7.7 of dressel et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "we exercised extra care in psf - matching our observations given the short lever arm available in wavelength to derive @xmath18-continuum slopes @xmath0 at @xmath1 - 8 ( particularly @xmath10 - 8 ) and therefore the sensitivity of these measurements to small systematics in the derived colors ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "normally the psf - matching is automatically handled with our software with encircled energy distributions being reproduced to @xmath602 - 3% . however , because of the sensitivity of our results to small errors in the psf matching , we took a particularly rigorous approach and further optimized our algorithm to do the psf - matching between the @xmath31-band observations and the @xmath32-band observations .",
    "we constructed the psf in each band using the average two - dimensional profiles of a small number of relatively high s / n , unsaturated stars from our hudf reductions ( here 5 ) to construct the core of the psf ( to radii @xmath610.6@xmath62 ) and then using the tabulated encircled energy distributions to construct the profile of stars at larger radii @xmath630.6@xmath62 .",
    "we verified that the encircled energy distribution we extracted for the psf in each band reproduced that from the tabulated encircled energy distribution ( dressel et al .",
    "2012 : after accounting for the non - zero size of the drizzle kernel ) to within 1%",
    ". we also compared the encircled energy distributions from the psfs we constructed with those from those derived by the 3d hst team ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2013 ; skelton et al .  2014 ) and found agreement to within 1% at a radius of @xmath490.2@xmath62 . finally , we computed the radii containing 70% of the light for each of these psfs and compared them with the results from the hudf12 team ( e.g. , dunlop et al .",
    "we found excellent agreement overall ( typically @xmath610.005@xmath62 ) .",
    "in using our derived psfs to psf - match the observations , we explicitly solved for the kernel that when convolved with the @xmath31-band psf would reproduce the encircled - energy distribution for the @xmath32-band psf to @xmath641.2% ( see appendix a ) .",
    "a similar procedure was used for psf - matching the observations in the other bands to the @xmath32-band observations .",

    "while there are many potentially important biases for determinations of the mean @xmath0 , one of the most prominent sources of bias that has received much discussion recently regards the interplay between redshift selection and @xmath0 measurement ( see appendix b.1.2 of bouwens et al .",

    "sizeable biases in the measured @xmath0 s can occur , if the same information is used to select galaxies as is used to measure their @xmath18-continuum slopes @xmath0 .",
    "since sources with bluer observed colors ( redward of an apparent lyman break ) are more readily identified as @xmath10 galaxies than sources with redder observed colors , one would be biased towards selecting sources which also have the bluest - apparent @xmath0 , if the high - redshift selection is performed in the conventional way .    to overcome this bias , we must ensure that the information we have on sources relevant to their selection as @xmath10 galaxies ( detection significance , color redward of the break ) is completely independent of that required to measure the @xmath18-continuum slope @xmath0 . accomplishing this",
    ", however , requires that we be able to define two colors redward of the break that are entirely independent of each other .",
    "this appears to be challenging for @xmath10 sources , due to the availability of only three different near - ir passbands with deep observations in the typical legacy field . for example ,",
    "only three near - ir bands are available with deep wfc3/ir coverage in public surveys like candels ( grogin et al .  2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) , the early release science ( ers ) program ( windhorst et al .",
    "2011 ) , or the hudf09 program ( bouwens et al .",

    "2012 ) or to argue that observations in a fourth wfc3/ir band ( e.g. , f140w ) may be required to obtain unbiased measurements of @xmath0 at @xmath10 ( rogers et al .  2013 ;",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "while this latter approach , with more bands has merit , very few data sets have deep observations in so many filters , and restricting @xmath10 @xmath0 studies to those that do would restrict our ability to build up maximally - sized samples over a wide range of luminosity .",

    "observations in a fourth wfc3/ir band are not required to obtain bias - free results for @xmath0 .",
    "the approach is simply to construct two independent , equal - depth reductions of both the @xmath31 and @xmath32-band data by splitting the full dataset on each field in half .",
    "each dataset consists of dithered images that are reduced using our standard wfc3/ir pipeline ( e.g. , as in bouwens et al .",

    "finally , the value of @xmath0 one derives can also show some dependence ( @xmath270 ) on the precise filter set or wavelength range one uses to estimate @xmath0 .",

    "moreover , the measured @xmath0 s from the two selections typically differ by less than @xmath367 .",

    "this approach is valuable in cases where data are available in only three near - infrared filters , since this would normally lead to systematic errors from the crosstalk between color information needed for redshift determination and that needed to determine @xmath0 . we demonstrate here the effectiveness of this approach using realistic end - to - end simulations .",
    "we assume that all galaxies have exactly the same intrinsic sed  which we take to be a perfect power - law spectrum with @xmath280 .",

    "all photometric criteria used to identify high - redshift galaxies , whether it be a traditional lyman - break selection or a simple photometric redshift approach , are much more effective in the selection of sources with bluer spectral slopes than in the selection of sources with redder slopes . as a result",
    ", the bluest galaxies at high redshifts will be overrepresented in high - redshift samples relative to the reddest galaxies ( proportionally speaking ) , resulting in a biased measurement of the mean @xmath0 in high - redshift samples , if one does not control for these effects .",
    "in general , the bias in the @xmath0 one derives will be quite large , if the information one uses to derive @xmath0 is not independent of the information one uses to select sources .",
    "in this situation , noise can drive both the selection of sources and the measurement of @xmath0 , resulting in potentially large biases in @xmath0 . such a scenario",
    "is extensively discussed by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and has been called the photometric error coupling bias by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2012 : see appendix b.1.2 from that work ) .    as a result of such concerns",
    ", great care has been taken here to ensure that the @xmath0 measurements reported here are entirely decoupled from the selection process ( and for the definition of the photometric apertures ) for the faintest sources in all of our high redshift samples .",
    "this ensures , by construction , that the photometric error coupling bias is identically zero .",
    "however , one can still arrive at a biased measurement of the mean @xmath0 , even if one measures their mean @xmath0 using independent information from what one uses to select high - redshift sources .",
    "this is as a result of the fact that sources with intrinsically bluer colors are selected more efficiently than those with redder colors .    to compute the size of this bias for our @xmath0 results , we added artificial sources to the real observations over a wide range in @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath385 to @xmath386 ) , @xmath18 luminosity , and redshift . to simulate the spatial profiles of individual sources we added to the real data , we made use of similar - luminosity @xmath1 galaxies from the xdf data set and artificially redshifted them using our `` cloning '' machinery ( bouwens et al .",
    "1998 ; bouwens et al .  2003 ) to a range of redshifts over the selection window of our high - redshift samples , scaling their physical sizes as @xmath387 to match the observed scalings ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",

    "then , using the selection efficiency results from the above simulations and assuming that the inherent @xmath0 s for @xmath1 - 8 galaxies is normally distributed with some mean value and a standard deviation @xmath388 ( consistent with that derived by bouwens et al .  2009 ; bouwens et al .  2012 ; castellano et al .",
    "2012 ) , we have calculated the bias in @xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : seleff ] .",
    "in general , the bias we expect in @xmath0 is not especially large , @xmath389 , and should not appreciably bias the results for all three input @xmath0 s we have considered , i.e. , @xmath20 , @xmath390 , and @xmath262 . while the computed bias could be quite a bit larger if the intrinsic @xmath0 distribution were larger , recent results by rogers et al .",
    "( 2014 ) not only confirm that the intrinsic width of the @xmath0 distribution is @xmath490.35 , but provide evidence that the width of this distribution is even narrower for lower luminosity sources .",
    "this strongly suggests that any biases resulting from differences in the intrinsic selectability of sources should be small , i.e. , @xmath389 .",
    "similar simulations were previously presented in appendix b.1.1 of bouwens et al .",
    "our primary method for deriving @xmath0 at @xmath26 only makes use of the flux measurements in the @xmath45 and @xmath32 bands .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that for both bands , the full wavelength coverage lies firmly in the @xmath18-continuum and redward of the lyman break , and therefore the @xmath282 color provides a reliable measurement of the @xmath18 slope @xmath0 .",
    "one significant drawback , however , in restricting ourselves to the use of these bands in deriving @xmath0 is the limited leverage in wavelength the two bands provide for determining @xmath0 , resulting in much larger statistical uncertainties in the derived @xmath0 s .",
    "fortunately , one can consider making use of the observed @xmath31-band flux to gain additional leverage for constraining the @xmath18-continuum slope @xmath0 .",
    "the challenge with including @xmath31-band flux measurements in the fits is that both ly@xmath204 and the lyman break begin to enter the @xmath31 band at @xmath392 ( see figure  [ fig : beta8 ] ) .",
    "this can significantly bias the measured @xmath0 s for individual @xmath26 sources if this effect is not corrected for .",
    "the lyman break would make @xmath26 galaxies too faint in the @xmath31-band relative to the baseline continuum values , while ly@xmath204 emission would make the @xmath31-band fluxes too bright .",
    "while one might imagine that this issue would be isolated to only those sources with redshift estimates in excess of 8.0 , the redshift of each source in our @xmath26 sample is uncertain and so could potentially be in excess of 8 ( and therefore be biased by this issue , if not corrected ) .",
    "corrections for igm absorption can also be somewhat model dependent .",
    "it is because of these challenges that we opted not to use this as our primary approach .    in order to overcome these issues and",
    "still make use of the observed @xmath31-band fluxes to derive @xmath0 , it is clear that a correction to the @xmath31-band fluxes of @xmath26 sources is required .",
    "here we estimate the approximate effect the lyman - break has on the @xmath31-band flux based on the redshifts we infer for sources using their measured @xmath393 colors .",
    "three different sed templates are considered in correcting the @xmath31-band fluxes for @xmath26 galaxies in our samples : the first assuming constant star formation for 100 myr , the second assuming constant star formation for 10 myr , and the third assuming constant star formation for @xmath394 myr followed by 20 myr with no star formation .",
    "different star formation histories were explored to see what effect the shape of the @xmath18-continuum has on the derived @xmath18-continuum slopes . sed templates were derived for each of these star - formation histories using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) spectral synthesis code and 0.2 @xmath311 metallicities . from the inset of figure  [ fig : beta8 ] ,",
    "it is clear that the unknown star - formation histories for individual sources could have a modest effect on the results .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections we adopt are taken to be an average of the results for the first and third model star - formation histories .",
    "the observed @xmath31-band fluxes for @xmath26 galaxies are also attenuated somewhat due to damped absorption from neutral hydrogen gas in the galaxy and likely an increasingly neutral igm . assuming a neutral hydrogen column of @xmath491@xmath35110@xmath395 @xmath396 in individual galaxies",
    ", we estimate that the ly@xmath204 damping wing could attenuate the @xmath31-band flux seen from individual sources by @xmath492 - 3% .",
    "we also account for some absorption from neutral hydrogen in the igm ( miralda - escude 1998 ) , assuming a neutral fraction @xmath397 of 0.2 at @xmath26 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2012 ; kuhlen & faucher - giguere 2012 ; robertson et al .  2013 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath31-band fluxes are corrected for this effect based on the redshifts we infer for sources from their @xmath393 colors .",
    "accounting for the effect of ly@xmath204 emission on the observed @xmath31-band fluxes would also be useful",
    ". however , spectroscopic follow - up of current @xmath10 - 8 samples ( e.g. , ono et al .",
    "2012 ; schenker et al .  2012",
    "; pentericci et al .  2011 ; caruana et al .",
    "2012 ) seems to suggest that ly@xmath204 emission is quite rare in these sources ( likely due to an increasingly neutral medium ) .",
    "therefore , we would not expect ly@xmath204 emission to have a large effect on the observed colors . if this is not the case for all sources , this could bias the measurements .",
    "this second approach to deriving @xmath0 for @xmath26 galaxies is very similar to one recently utilized by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in examining the spectral slopes of @xmath26 galaxies over the hudf12",
    ". however , dunlop et al .",
    "( 2013 ) appear to have made no correction to the @xmath31-band fluxes used in their fits , since this issue is not discussed in their paper . using the redshift distribution dunlop et al .",
    "( 2013 ) estimate for their @xmath26 sample ( appendix a of dunlop et al .",
    "2013 ) , we estimate that the bias in @xmath0 will be @xmath398 to the red .",
    "while this bias is likely not huge ( and here we assume that the contribution from ly@xmath204 emission is not substantial ) , it will cause the @xmath0 s inferred by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to be slightly redder than what we find in  6.2 ( at least for the @xmath26 @xmath0 s they derive from the @xmath215 colors ) .",
    "in this section , we apply the approach we describe in the previous section to the three deepest hst fields to derive the mean @xmath0 for faint @xmath26 galaxies . for consistency with our primary @xmath0 determinations for @xmath26 galaxies in",
    " 6 , we use the same criteria for selecting @xmath26 galaxies as given in  6.1 .",
    "there we derived the mean @xmath0 based on a small @xmath26 sample from the xdf data set using a power - law fit to the @xmath45 and @xmath32-band fluxes .    similar to the strategy",
    "we employ on our @xmath10 samples , we split the @xmath31-band observations into two equal subsets and alternatively select and measure @xmath0 on each half of the data .",
    "this is to ensure that our results are not biased due to a coupling between the @xmath31-band flux used to derive @xmath0 and that used to select the sources . given the sensitivity of our results to having accurate @xmath393 colors for candidates in our @xmath26 ( see figure  [ fig : beta8 ] ) , we restrict our analysis to only those sources from the xdf data set in determining the mean @xmath18-continuuum slopes @xmath0 .",
    "we plot the observed @xmath0 s for individual sources in figure  [ fig : colmag8b ] as a function of their measured luminosities .",
    "subdividing our @xmath26 sample by @xmath18 luminosity , we derive the inverse - variance - weighted mean @xmath0 s for sources in each luminosity bin .",
    "the results are then presented in figure  [ fig : colmag8b ] as the large blue squares .",
    "the inverse - variance - weighted mean @xmath0 in the luminosity interval @xmath220 is @xmath288 .",
    "this determination is quite consistent with the @xmath0 for derive for @xmath26 in a similar luminosity interval in  6.2 , i.e. , @xmath21.88@xmath130.74@xmath130.27 . while it might seem surprising that our determination using the full @xmath391 flux information is bluer than the determination from  6.2 given what was argued about the impact of the igm on the @xmath31 flux for @xmath285 sources , we emphasize that the @xmath26 @xmath0 s we derive in this section are based on @xmath31-band fluxes _ corrected _ for the impact of the igm .    finally , we fit the @xmath0 vs. @xmath128 relationship to a line , fixing the slope of this relationship to the average slope found for @xmath1 - 6 galaxies by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , i.e. , @xmath147 .",
    "the best - fit intercept for this relationship at @xmath128 luminosity of @xmath399 mag is @xmath400 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with that given in  6.2 .",
    "to facilitate comparisons with the present results ( and in the interests of transparency ) , we provide a complete list of the sources in our @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath401 , @xmath10 , and @xmath26 samples in table  [ tab : mrtable ] .",
