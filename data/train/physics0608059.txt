    "perhaps for many , ghosts , vampires , zombies and the like are no more than hollywood fantasy .",
    "however , increasingly these movies have come to reflect the popularity of pseudoscientific beliefs in the general public .",
    "for instance , the movie  white noise , \" starring michael keaton , is based on the new trend among paranormalists  electronic voice phenomena ( evp ) .",
    "the occult underground in both america and europe is witnessing a trendy rise in vampirism and belief in voodoo zombiefication which is widespread in many parts of south america and africa . additionally , paranormal depictions in the media , especially tv and hollywood motion pictures , have a definite influence on the way in which people think about paranormal claims ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in this article",
    "we point out inconsistencies associated with the ghost , vampire and zombie mythologies as portrayed in popular films and folklore , and give practical explanations to some of their features .",
    "we also use the occasion as an excuse to learn a little about physics and mathematics .",
    "of course the paranormalist or occultist could claim that the hollywood portrayal is a rather unsophisticated and inaccurate representation of their beliefs , and thus the discussion we give hear is moot .",
    "however , if they are to change their definition each time we raise issue , then all that they are really arguing is that there exists something out there which may be given the name ` ghost ' , for instance .",
    "surely , no skeptic could argue with this .",
    "it has become almost a hollywood cliche that the entrance of a ghostly presence be foreshadowed by a sudden and overwhelming chill ( see , for example ,  the sixth sense \" , starring bruce willis ) .",
    "in fact , sharp temperature drops are commonly reported in association with supposed real - life encounters with ghosts or poltergeists .",
    "this feature of supposed ghost sightings lends itself naturally to physical explanation .    the famous haunted gallery at hampton court palace near london , uk",
    ", is reputedly stalked by the spirit of catherine howard , who was executed on 13 february , 1542 , by henry viii .",
    "visitors to the room have described hearing screams and seeing apparitions in the gallery .",
    "a team of ghost - busting psychologists , led by dr richard wiseman of hertfordshire university , installed thermal cameras and air movement detectors in the gallery .",
    "about 400 palace visitors were then quizzed on whether they could feel a  presence \" in the gallery .",
    "more than half reported sudden drops in temperature and some said they sensed a ghostly presence .",
    "several people claimed to have seen elizabethan figures .    before moving on to an explanation",
    ", we will need to outline the concept of heat .",
    "when a ` warm ' object is placed next to a ` cool ' object ( see figure [ heat ] ) energy will begin to flow from the warmer body , causing it to cool , to the cooler body , causing it to warm .",
    "this energy , which is being transferred between the two objects due to their difference in temperature , is called _",
    "heat_. note that an object is never said to ` possess ' any amount of heat .",
    "heat is only defined through transfer .",
    "for instance , no matter how high one turns their stove , it never possesses any degree of heat . in the instance where someone suddenly touches the stove",
    ", however , there is the feeling of heat  it is the energy flowing from the stove to that person s hand .",
    "as heat continues to be transferred from the warmer body to the cooler one in figure [ heat ] , and the warmer body s temperature continues to drop while the cooler body s temperature climbs , there comes a point when the two bodies are at the same temperature . at this point heat ceases to flow between the two object since neither is the hotter one and heat has no definite direction in which to be transferred .",
    "this condition is called _",
    "thermal equilibrium_.    in our stove example , heat was transferred via _ conduction _  the exchange of heat through direct contact .",
    "there are two other modes by which heat may be transferred .",
    "these two modes involve the exchange of heat by two objects which are separated by some distance .",
    "if these two objects are emersed in a fluid ( earth s atmosphere for example ) , then the warmer body may provide heat to the fluid in its immediate vicinity .",
    "this warmer fluid will then tend to rise thus coming in contact with a cooler body above .",
    "there may also be a lateral current in the fluid , thus allowing the heated fluid to affect a cooler body to the side .",
    "this type of heat transfer , by an intermediary fluid , is called _",
    "convection_.        in figure [ convection](a )",
    "we give an example of what is known as _",
    "convection currents_. suppose that the right wall is kept warm and the left wall is kept cool .",
    "then air in contact with the right wall will tend to gain heat and rise while air in contact with the left wall will tend to loose heat and then sink .",
    "the circular flow that then forms is called a convection current .",
    "air cycles around a loop picking up some heat at the right wall , dropping it off at the left wall , and then coming back around again .",
    "actually , the air current pattern will be somewhat more complicated than what we just described .",
    "there will be all kinds of smaller cycles and eddies embedded in some complex pattern as in figure [ convection](b ) .",
    "the overall flow , however , will be as in figure [ convection](a ) .",
    "the third mode of heat transfer allows for exchange between two separated objects even if they are in a total vacuum .",
    "how can two objects exchange heat if there is no mater in between them ?",
    "the answer is _ radiation_. the thermal energy of a body",
    "is expressed in the ` jiggling ' of its various constituent particles .",
    "as electrically charged particles within a body jiggle about , they produce electromagnetic waves .",
    "when these waves hit another body , they cause the particles in that body to jiggle even more than they were before and thus the body heats up . since hotter bodies produce more of this radiation , there will be more radiation from the hotter body falling upon the cooler body than radiation from the cooler body falling upon the hotter body .",
    "thus , overall , the hotter body will be loosing heat while the cooler body will be gaining heat .",
    "we will not be too concerned with this particular mechanism for heat exchange here .",
    "returning to the haunted gallery at hampton court palace , dr wiseman s team reported that the experiences could be simply explained by the gallery s numerous concealed doors .",
    "these elderly exits are far from draught - proof and the combination of air currents which they let in cause sudden changes in the room s temperature . in two particular spots , the temperature of the gallery plummeted by up to @xmath0c ( @xmath1f ) .",
    " you do , literally , walk into a column of cold air sometimes , \" said dr wiseman .",
    " it s possible that people are misattributing normal phenomena ... if you suddenly feel cold , and you re in a haunted place , that might bring on a sense of fear and a more scary experience . \"",
    "the rumor that ` cold spots ' are associated with ghosts seems to be a myth created by the construction of old building and the vivid imagination of people .    but how could a few degrees drop in temperature explain the dramatic chills described in so many in ghostly accounts ? first off , what we sense as cold is not correlated to temperature so much as the rate at which heat is being transferred from our body to the environment . for instance , even in a temperate pool , one feel a very sharp chill when one first enters . a moderate draft containing",
    "condensed moisture could cause a very sharp sensation of cold .",
    "secondly , we are all aware of the ` tall - tale ' effect .",
    "memories tend to become distorted and exaggerated .",
    "it is exactly this reason why scientists tend not to rely on unchecked eyewitness accounts .",
    "popular myth holds that ghosts are material - less .",
    "for instance in the movie  ghost \" ( starring patrick swayze , demi moore , whoopi goldberg ) , the recently deceased main character tries desperately to save his former lover from a violent intruder .",
    "his attempts grant him no avail , as at each lunge he passes right through the perpetrator .",
    "it is interesting , however , that he was able to walk up the stairs just prior to this .",
    "in fact , this is a common feature of the ghost myth .",
    "ghosts are held to be able to walk about as they please , but they pass through walls and any attempt to pick up an object or affect their environment in any other way leads to material - less inefficacy  unless they are poltergeists , of course !",
    "let us examine the process of walking in detail .",
    "now walking requires an interaction with the floor and such interactions are explained by _ newton s laws of motion_. newton s _ first law _ is the law of inertia .",
    "it states that a body at rest will remain at rest until acted upon by an _ external _ force .",
    "therefore , a person can not start walking unless a force , applied by some body other than herself , is acting upon her .",
    "but where is the force coming from ?",
    "the only object in contact with the person while walking is the floor .",
    "so , the force moving a person during walking is coming from the floor . but how does the floor know to exert a force when the person wants to start walking and stop exerting it when the person wants to stand ? actually , there is no magic here .",
    "the person actually tells the floor .",
    "she tells the floor by using newton s _ third law_.    newton s third law says that if one object exerts a force on another object , then the second object exerts a force , that is equal but oppositely directed , on the first object  hence  for each action there is an equal but opposite reaction . \"",
    "thus when the skate - boarder in figure [ thirdlaw ] pushes on the wall , the wall pushes right back on her , causing her to accelerate off to the left .",
    "thus walking goes like this ( see figure [ walking ] ) : the person wanting to do the walking must remain at rest unless a force acts on her .",
    "she gets the floor to apply a force to her by applying a backward force on the floor with her foot .",
    "she keeps repeating this action , alternating feet .",
    "the point is that for the ghost to walk , it must be applying forces to the floor .",
    "now the floor is part of the physical universe .",
    "thus the ghost has an affect on the physical universe .",
    "if this is so , then we can detect the ghost through physical observation .",
    "that is , the depiction of ghosts walking , contradicts the precept that ghosts are material - less .",
    "so which is it ?",
    "are ghosts material or material - less ?",
    "maybe they are only material when it comes to walking .",
    "well then we must assume that they ca nt control this selective material - lessness , otherwise patrick swayze would have saved his girlfriend in  ghost . \" in this case , we could place stress sensors on the floor and detect a ghost s presence .",
    "maybe they walk by some other supernatural means .",
    "well why ca nt they use this power to manipulate objects when they want to ? even more , it seems strange to have a supernatural power that only allows you to get around by mimicking human ambulation .",
    "this is a very slow and awkward way of moving about in the scheme of things . in any case",
    ", you d have to go to some lengths to make this whole thing consistent .",
    "incidentally , the reader may have noticed that we skipped a law in our discussion .",
    "we heard about the first law and the third of newton s laws .",
    "newton s second law of motion is that the acceleration of an object  the rate at which it speeds up  is proportional to the net force applied , the constant of proportionality being the mass .",
    "we did nt need the precise statement of this law but , we did make implicit use of it .",
    "the second law implies that the acceleration of an object will be nonzero ( and thus the object will be able to change its state of motion ) only if a net force is acting on it .",
    "this consistent with our statement ` therefore , a person can not start walking unless a force , applied by some body other than herself , is acting upon her . '",
    "anyone whose seen john carpenter s  vampires \" or the movie  blade \" or any of the host of other vampire films is already quite familiar with how the legend goes .",
    "the vampires need to feed on human blood .",
    "after one has stuck his fangs into your neck and sucked you dry , you turn into a vampire yourself and carry on the blood sucking legacy . the fact of the matter is , if vampires truly feed with even a tiny fraction of the frequency that they are depicted to in movies and folklore , then the human race would have been wiped out quite quickly after the first vampire appeared .",
    "let us assume that a vampire need feed only once a month .",
    "this is certainly a highly conservative assumption given any hollywood vampire film .",
    "now two things happen when a vampire feeds .",
    "the human population decreases by one and the vampire population increases by one .",
    "let us suppose that the first vampire appeared in 1600 ad .",
    "it does nt really matter what date we choose for the first vampire to appear ; it has little bearing on our argument .",
    "we list a government website in the references @xcite which provides an estimate of the world population for any given date . for january 1 , 1600 we will accept that the global population was 536,870,911 millions . beyond mathematical simplification , our choice has little impact on the argument to follow . if we were to report any number in the range of possible values for the population in year 1600 , the end result of our calculations below would be essentially the same . ] in our argument , we had at the same time 1 vampire .",
    "we will ignore the human mortality and birth rate for the time being and only concentrate on the effects of vampire feeding . on february 1st , 1600 1",
    "human will have died and a new vampire born .",
    "this gives 2 vampires and @xmath2 humans .",
    "the next month there are two vampires feeding and thus two humans die and two new vampires are born .",
    "this gives 4 vampires and @xmath3 humans .",
    "now on april 1st , 1600 there are 4 vampires feeding and thus we have 4 human deaths and 4 new vampires being born .",
    "this gives us 8 vampires and @xmath4 humans .    by now",
    "the reader has probably caught on to the progression .",
    "each month the number of vampires doubles so that after @xmath5 months have passed there are @xmath6 vampires .",
    "this sort of progression is known in mathematics as a _ geometric progression _  more specifically it is a geometric progression with ratio 2 , since we multiply by 2 at each step .",
    "a geometric progression increases at a very tremendous rate , a fact that will become clear shortly .",
    "now all but one of these vampires were once human so that the human population is its original population minus the number of vampires excluding the original one .",
    "so after @xmath5 months have passed there are @xmath7 humans .",
    "the vampire population increases geometrically and the human population decreases geometrically .",
    "table [ table : vamp ] above lists the vampire and human population at the beginning each month over a 29 month period .    .vampire and human population at the beginning of each month during a 29 month period . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that by month number 30 , the table lists a human population of zero .",
    "we conclude that if the first vampire appeared on january 1st of 1600 ad , humanity would have been wiped out by june of 1602 , two and half years later .",
    "all this may seem artificial since we ignored other effects on the human population .",
    "mortality due to factors other then vampires would only make the decline in humans more rapid and therefore strengthen our conclusion .",
    "the only thing that can weaken our conclusion is the human birth rate .",
    "note that our vampires have gone from 1 to 536,870,912 in two and a half year . to keep up",
    ", the human population would have had to increase by the same amount .",
    "the website @xcite mentioned earlier also provides estimated birth rates for any given time .",
    "if you go to it , you will notice that the human birth rate never approaches anything near such a tremendous value .",
    "in fact in the long run , for humans to survive , our population must _ at leat _ essentially double each month ! this is clearly way beyond the human capacity of reproduction .",
    "if we factor in the human birthrate into our discussion , we would find that after a few months , the human birthrate becomes a very small fraction of the number of deaths due to vampires .",
    "this means that ignoring this factor has a negligibly small impact on our conclusion . in our example",
    ", the death of humanity would be prolonged by only one month .",
    "we conclude that vampires can not exist , since their existence contradicts the existence of human beings .",
    "incidently , the logical proof that we just presented is of a type known as _",
    "reductio ad absurdum _ ,",
    "that is , reduction to the absurd .",
    "another philosophical principal related to our argument is the truism given the elaborate title , the _ anthropic principle_. this states that if something is necessary for human existence , then it must be true since we do exist . in the present case ,",
    "the nonexistence of vampires is necessary for human existence .",
    "apparently , whomever devised the vampire legend had failed his college algebra and philosophy courses .",
    "the zombie legends portrayed in movies such as  dawn of the dead \" or  28 days later \" follow a similar pattern to the vampire legends .",
    "once you are attacked by zombies , while you may manage to escape immediate death , you will eventually die and turn into a zombie yourself .",
    "thus this particular type of zombie legend suffers the same flaw that we pointed out for the vampire legend previously .",
    "we still have some more work to do , however .",
    "there exists a second sort of zombie legend which pops its head up throughout the western hemisphere  the legend of ` voodoo zombiefication ' .",
    "this myth is somewhat different from the one just described in that zombies do not multiply by feeding on humans but come about by a voodoo hex being placed by a sorcerer on one of his enemy .",
    "the myth presents an additional problem for us : one can witness for them self very convincing examples of zombiefication by traveling to haiti or any number of other regions in the world where voodoo is practiced .",
    "we describe the particular case of wilfrid doricent , an adolescent school boy from a small village in haiti .",
    "one day wilfred had become terribly ill .",
    "he was experiencing dramatic convulsions , his body had swelled terribly and his eyes had turned yellow .",
    "eight days latter , wilfred appeared to have died .",
    "this was confirmed by not only by the family and family friends present but also by the local medical doctor who could detect no vital signs .",
    "wilfred s body appeared to show bloating due to rigor - mortis and gave off the foul stench of death and rot .",
    "his body was buried soon thereafter .",
    "some time afterward , the weekly village cock - fight was interrupted as an incognizant figure appeared .",
    "the villagers were shocked as they gazed upon the exact likeness of wilfred .",
    "the arrival was indeed wilfred as his family verified by noting scars from old injuries and other such details .",
    "wilfred , however , had lost his memory and was unable to speak or comprehend anything . his family had to keep him in shackles so that he would nt harm himself in his incoherent state .",
    "it appeared that wilfred s body had risen from death leaving his sole in the possession of some voodoo sorcerer .",
    "word of wilfred s ` zombiefication ' spread quickly throughout the village .",
    "it was believed that wilfred s uncle , a highly feared voodoo sorcerer who had been engaged in a dispute over land with wilfred s family , was the culprit . wilfred s uncle was later charged with zombiefication , a crime in haiti equivalent to murder .",
    "is this truly a case of supernatural magic ? to answer this question , we turn our attention to a highly toxic substance called tetrodotoxin ( ttx ) .",
    "bryan furlow gives an overview @xcite of ttx s effects blended with a story from the news :    at first the us federal officers thought they had stumbled upon a shipment of heroin .",
    "the suspicious package they intercepted last year [ 2000 ] , en route from japan to a private address in the us contained several vials packed with a white crystalline powder .",
    "but on - the - spot tests revealed that it was no narcotic .",
    "it took a while for forensic scientists at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california to identify a sample , and what they found was alarming .",
    "the powder turned out to be tetrodotoxin ( ttx ) : one of the deadliest poisons on earth .",
    "gram for gram , ttx is 10,000 times more lethal than cyanide ... this neurotoxin has a terrifying modus operandi25 minutes after exposure it begins to paralyze its victims , leaving the brain fully aware of what s happening .",
    "death usually results , within hours , from suffocation or heart failure .",
    "there is no antidote .",
    "but if luckless patients can hang on for 24 hours , they usually recover without further complications ...    the livermore team estimated that to extract the 90 milligrams of ttx discovered by the feds , you d need between 45 and 90 kilograms of puffer fish livers and ovaries  the animal s most deadly tissues .",
    "no one knows what use its intended recipient had in mind ...",
    "ttx is found in various sea creatures and , in particular , in various species of puffer fish .",
    "puffer fish are a delicacy in japan known as ` fugu ' where only trained and licensed individuals prepare it by carefully removing the viscera . of course , despite the care taken in preparation ,",
    "about 200 cases of puffer fish poisoning are reported per year with a mortality ate 50% .",
    "the symptoms of the poisoning are as follows @xcite :    the first symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and tongue , appearing between 20 minutes to three hours after eating poisonous puffer fish .",
    "the next symptom is increasing paraesthesia in the face and extremities , which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating .",
    "headache , epigastric pain , nausea , diarrhea , and/or vomiting may occur . occasionally , some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur .",
    "the second stage of the intoxication is increasing paralysis .",
    "many victims are unable to move ; even sitting may be difficult .",
    "there is increasing respiratory distress .",
    "speech is affected , and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea , cyanosis , and hypotension .",
    "paralysis increases and convulsions , mental impairment , and cardiac arrhythmia may occur . the victim ,",
    "although completely paralyzed , may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death .",
    "death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours , with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours .    sometimes however , a victim pronounced dead , is lucky enough to wake up just before his funeral and report to his bewildered family that he was fully conscious and aware of his surroundings the entire ordeal .",
    "therefore , ttx has the unusual characteristic that if a nonlethal dose is given , the brain will remain completely unaffected .",
    "if just the right dose is given , the toxin will mimic death in the victim , whose vitals will slow to an immeasurable state , and whose body will show signs of rigor - mortis and produce the odor of rot . getting such a precise dose",
    "would be rare for the case of fugu poisoning , but can easily be caused deliberately by a voodoo sorcerer , say , who could slip the dose into someone s food or drink .",
    "the secrets of zombiefication are closely guarded by voodoo sorcerers .",
    "however , frre dodo , a once highly feared voodoo sorcerer who is now an evangelical preacher and firm denouncer of the voodoo faith , has revealed the process .",
    "it turns out that zombiefication is accomplished by slipping the victim a potion whose main ingredient is powder derived from the liver of a species of puffer fish native to haitian waters .",
    "well , we now have an explanation for how wilfred could have been made to seem dead , even under the examination of a doctor .",
    "however , we have already said that the ttx paralysis was unlikely to have affected his brain . how does one account for wilfred s comatose mental state ?",
    "the answer is oxygen deprivation .",
    "wilfred was buried in a coffin in which relatively little air could have been trapped . wilfred s story probably goes something like this : slowly , the air in wilfred s coffin began to run out so that by the time he snapped out his ttx - induced paralysis , he had already suffered some degree of brain damage . at this point",
    "his survival instincts kicked in and he managed to dig himself out of his grave  graves tend to be dug shallow in haiti .",
    "he probably wondered around for some time before ending up back the village .",
    "neuropsychiatrist dr .",
    "roger mallory , of the haitian medical society , conducted a scan of zombiefied wilfred s brain .",
    "although the results were not as definite as had been hoped for , he and his colleagues found brain damage consistent with oxygen starvation .",
    "it would seem that zobiefication is nothing more then a skillful act of poisoning .",
    "the bodily functions of the poisoned person suspend so that he appears dead . after he is buried alive , lack of oxygen damages the brain .",
    "if the person is unburied before he really dies from suffocation , he will appear as a soulless creature ( ` zombie ' ) as he has lost what makes him human : the thinking process of the brain .",
    "we have examined the science behind three of the most popular pseudoscientific beliefs encountered in hollywood movies . for two of them",
    " the idea of ghosts and vampires  we have shown that they are inconsistent and contradictory to simple facts .",
    "for one of them  the idea of zombies  we have made no attempt to deny that it relies on real cases .",
    "however , we have reviewed evidence showing that the concept is a misrepresentation of simple criminal acts .",
    "wide spread belief in such concepts , we feel , is an indication of a lack of critical thinking skills in the general population . with simple elementary arguments one can easily discredit the validity of such claims .",
    "we thus finish with the following quote by carl sagan @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ both barnum and h.l .",

    "in addition , letters from readers were received after the publication of the article in the july / august 2008 issue of _ skeptical inquirer_.    the authors would like to thank all readers who took the time to send their comments although we were surprised ( and partly disappointed ) to see that the majority of the readers misunderstood the goal of the article .",
    "since most of the comments have considerable overlap , we thought we d summarize our explanations in one reply .",
    "we would like to point out that our article was not about definite proofs .",
    "we challenge the reader to devise an absolute , mathematical / logical proof that a given supernatural occurrence does not exist .",
    "our prediction is that the reader will fail .",
    "in particular there is no universally agreed upon mathematical / logical definition of the various apparitions considered in our article nor of the manner in which they operate / behave ( e.g. whether vampires deliberately control which of their victims turns into a vampire , etc ; cf the vast majority of the received comments ) . however , an inability to present a definite proof does not imply an inability to discover logical and scientific inconsistencies or other flaws in a claim .",
    "our article was intended merely as an entertaining vehicle of education aiming at stirring critical thinking .",
    "our goal was to remind readers that ( a ) pseudoscientific and paranormal ideas barely make sense when elementary logic and science is applied ; ( b ) when  and if  there is an element of truth , it is highly distorted and hidden behind elaborate myths ; ( c ) to teach readers a little about science and remind them to make probabilistic assessments of various claims using reason .",
    "many letters state that the authors have ` missed ' essential ideas in the ` vampirization ' of humans that invalidate the calculation and , thus , the final conclusion .",
    "we would like to assure the readers that we are familiar with all the variations of the myth .",
    "after all , how could we miss them if hollywood and novel writers bombard us with them daily ?",
    "we know about buffy , angel , blade and the other vampire hunters .",
    "we have read about multiple bites , drained bodies , transfer of blood and other protocols necessary to create new vampires . however , none of them can change the final conclusion of the ` impossibility of the existence of vampires ' albeit the line of reasoning might have to be modified slightly ( or radically if the premises are changed considerably ) . no matter what assumptions are required",
    ", one can create a corresponding mathematical model .",
    "the authors intentionally simplified the assumptions and avoided sophisticated mathematical models lest the article be inaccessible to some  depending on education . by introducing dynamical systems",
    ", one can construct highly sophisticated models for the vampire population versus the human population .",
    "for example , in one of the simplest models , known as the _ prey - predator model _ , the two populations fluctuate periodically .",
    "( for a simple presentation see @xcite . )",
    "if this model is used , the human population never disappears but it fluctuates between a maximum and a minimum value .",
    "one can immediately see now an argument against the existence of vampires : the human population has not fluctuated and even more it has kept ( and keeps ) increasing exponentially .",
    "one can start with this model and add additional features ( such as vampires slayers , vampire diseases , accidental exposure to sunlight , vampire babies , etc ) but the final outcome will not change : vampires can not exist since the model would predict a human population curve different from the actual one .    also , the reader should note that this discussion is based in elementary physics and mathematics .",
    "we never discussed the social implications .",
    "imagine what it would mean if every so often an exsanguinated human corpse was found ( even if only one vampire existed )",
    ". would nt this be _ the _ headline in the news ?",
    "unless , of course , all governments have conspired to keep these incidents secret ...    other messages to the authors pointed out similar omissions / holes in the arguments of ghosts and tried to affirm the existence of ghosts based on faith or incorrect physics explanations . unfortunately quantum mechanics and exotic matter can not give more substance to ghosts and faith can not be used as a substitute for proof . for reasons of limited space and time",
    "we bypass a rebuttal of each of the ( incorrect ) attempts to use physics to make the concept of ghosts consistent .",
    "many hollywood movies have some ideas that are consistent with science ideas but the majority of movies greatly offend mathematical and scientific laws .",
    "our reference to the movies was a motivational tool , mainly .",
    "the authors would enjoy a consistent script although research on the issue indicates that hollywood has a negative impact on scientific literacy in the public .",
    "ignoring misrepresentation of particular situations and even ignoring series like _ scifi investigates _ , _ ghusthunters _ , etc which involve people untrained in the scientific method of investigation , hollywood s current trend is to promote the supernatural over logic and scientific inquiry .",
    "science is irrelevant , it means trouble , is reflexively close - minded , and only laypersons will find the true solution .",
    "fortunately , a few people have tried to reverse the unchallenged way hollywood presents its ideas .",
    "there have been some excellent books based on hollywood products that explain science in an entertaining way . among our favorites",
    "are the classic book by lawrence krauss _ the physics of star trek _ and james kakalios s _ the physics of superheroes_. one of us ( c.e . )",
    "is involved in a more extensive project nicknamed _ physics in films _ @xcite that uses hollywood movies as a vehicle of education to increase the scientific literacy and the quantitative fluency of the public .",
    "the projects also attempts to reverse the unchallenged way that hollywood promotes its ideas .",
