    "the bepposax ( boella et al .  1997 ) and rxte ( levine  1996 ) satellites have brought a new dimension to gamma - ray burst ( grb ) research , by providing rapid localizations of several bursts per year . this has allowed many grbs to be followed up at other wavelengths , ranging from the x - ray ( costa et al .  1997 ) and optical ( van paradijs et al .  1997 ) to the radio ( frail et al .",
    "precise positions have also allowed redshifts to be measured for a number of grbs ( e.g. grb 970508 : metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , providing definitive proof of their cosmological origin .",
    "the extremely bright gamma - ray burst grb 991216 was detected by batse ( kippen , preece , & giblin  1999 ) on december 16.671544 ut , with its peak flux ( fluence ) ranking it as the 2nd ( 13th ) of all batse bursts detected so far .",
    "the rxte pca search for the x - ray afterglow of grb 991216 started about four hours after the burst ( takeshima et al .",
    "1999 ) and detected a strong , decaying x - ray afterglow , providing much improved burst position .",
    "it should be noted that the x - ray afterglow of grb 991216 was also detected by much less sensitive rxte asm instrument as early as one hour after the burst ( corbet & smith  1999 ) , providing a measurement of the x - ray afterglow at times which have previously not been studied .",
    "in addition , observations of grb 991216 by the chandra observatory resulted in the first arcsecond position determination for an x - ray afterglow ( piro et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb 991216 was identified by uglesich et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with data taken about @xmath5  hours ( december 17.142 and 17.372 ut ) after the burst , using the mdm 1.3-m telescope .",
    "it was recognized as a bright variable object ( @xmath6 at dec .",
    "17.142 ) , not present in the digitized poss ii plate , declining with a temporal decay index of @xmath7 .",
    "numerous independent confirming observations of the fading optical transient ( ot ) have followed , starting with henden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and jha et al .",
    "near - infrared observations were also reported by vreeswijk ( 1999a ) and garnavich  ( 1999b ) .",
    "absorption lines at @xmath8 seen in the optical spectrum of grb  991216 taken with the vlt - ut1 8-m telescope by vreeswijk et al .",
    "( 1999b ) provide a lower limit to the redshift of the grb source . given the gamma - ray fluence ( kippen 1999 ) ,",
    "the isotropic energy from the burst was more than 8@xmath9  ergs ( @xmath10 km@xmath11s@xmath12mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , or nearly half a solar rest mass radiated away in under 10 seconds .",
    "this exceedingly large energy requirement can be reduced if the burst emission is beamed . to date ,",
    "evidence for jets has been found in only a handful of grb afterglows ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; stanek et al . 1999 ) and it remains to be shown whether anisotropy is ubiquitous .",
    "we present optical and near - ir photometry of grb  991216 from observations obtained at the hawaii 88-inch and the fred l. whipple 1.2 m telescopes .",
    "we describe the data and the reduction procedure in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss the multiband temporal behavior of the grb ot . in section 4",
    "we describe the broad - band spectral properties of the afterglow deduced from our ir / optical data .",
    "[ fig : field ]    the near - infrared data were obtained with the fred l. whipple observatory 1.2-meter telescope on four consecutive nights beginning 1999 dec .",
    "17.22 ( ut ) .",
    "images were taken with the `` stelircam '' two - channel ir camera which utilizes two @xmath16 pixel hgcdte arrays .",
    "a dichroic mirror splits the beam at @xmath17 m allowing simultaneous observations in two filters .",
    "the grb afterglow was observed in j and k filters manufactured by barr .",
    "the camera has three sets of re - imaging optics and we employed the 5@xmath18 field - of - view with a 1.2@xmath19 per pixel scale .",
    "we immediately began imaging the rxte localization error box after being notified of a bright grb detected by batse through the gcn circulars .",
    "a 3@xmath203 mapping ( 15@xmath18 field ) around the initial rxte position was performed with two 60 second exposures taken at each pointing . a @xmath21 mag object that did not appear on the digitized sky survey",
    "was tentatively identified as the afterglow candidate ( garnavich et al .",
    "1999a ) , however it was pointed out by diercks  ( 1999a ) that the star appeared on the poss - ii n emulsion photographs and was likely to be a very red star .",
    "rxte revised its error box 8@xmath18 northward from the original position and a new mapping was begun .",
    "uglesich  ( 1999 ) then identified the true afterglow near the revised position soon after observations at flwo were terminated .",
    "fortunately the original mapping and the mapping centered on the revised rxte error box included the object in several of the images . in subsequent nights",
    "grb 991216 was observed in @xmath22 and @xmath23 with 9@xmath2060 second exposure sets .",
    "an extensive number of persson  ( 1998 ) standards were observed on dec .",
    "18 ( ut ) and used to calibrate stars in the grb field ( table  1 ; figure  1 ) .",
    "our @xmath22 and @xmath23 calibrations are in good agreement with that of henden , guetter , & vrba ( 2000 ) , but our grb magnitudes are 20% to 30% fainter in @xmath22 and brighter in @xmath23 than the vreeswijk  ( 1999a ) infrared photometry .",
    "after the optical counterpart was identified , a single exposure of the field was obtained with the university of hawaii 88-inch telescope . by then , the target was well past the meridian and the data suffered from a high airmass . on dec .",
    "18 ( ut ) the field was observed at two epochs and landolt standards ( landolt 1992 ) imaged to calibrate the data . since grb  991216 was only observed in the @xmath24 filter , no color correction was possible and we estimate the uncertainty from unknown color term as 5% .",
    "our @xmath24-band calibration of stars a and b are in good agreement with that found by dolan  ( 1999 ) .",
    "our final @xmath24-band magnitudes are on average 0.08  mag fainter than the preliminary magnitudes given in jha et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and garnavich et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .    from our optical imaging",
    "we find a position for the transient of @xmath25 @xmath26 ( j2000 ) with an accuracy of @xmath27 based on positions from the usno a2.0 catalog ( monet  1996 ) .",
    "[ fig : time ]    figure  2 shows the @xmath28 light curves of grb991216 .",
    "additional @xmath24-band points obtained from gcn circulars ( uglesich et al . 1999 ; dolan et al . 1999 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "1999a ; diercks et al .",
    "1999b ; jensen et al .",
    "1999 ; leibowitz et al . 1999",
    "; mattox 1999 ) are also plotted , but the comparison stars used in their calibration are sometimes not known and these points are used here only to confirm the trends seen in our data .",
    "late - time observations by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and schaefer ( 2000 ) use the dolan  ( 1999 ) or jha  ( 1999 ) calibrations and are consistent with our points .",
    "the light curves appear to follow a single power - law between 0.5 days and four days after the burst .",
    "so not to confuse the temporal and spectral variations , we will use the convention that @xmath29 .",
    "a single power - law was fitted to our data points by allowing the magnitude shift between @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the shift between @xmath22 and @xmath24 be free parameters .",
    "the result is shown as the solid lines in figure  2 and provides an index of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "fitting the individual bands gives indices of @xmath32 for @xmath23 , @xmath33 for @xmath22 and @xmath34 for @xmath24 .",
    "combining our three @xmath24-band observations with six observations from the gcn circulars obtained within four days of the burst gives a power - law index of @xmath35 , somewhat steeper than the decay rate found by sagar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from the raw gcn @xmath24-band magnitudes .",
    "clearly , a power - law index of @xmath36 is a good fit to all three bands given the estimated errors .",
    "extrapolating the @xmath24 fit to the late - time observations by schaefer ( 2000 ) and djorgovski  ( 1999 ) shows that the single power - law is consistent with the data out to 20 days after the burst .",
    "the @xmath24-band point by mattox ( 1999 ) appears significantly below the trend .",
    "our @xmath22-band photometry , obtained near that time , shows no deviation from the fit , however , we can not rule out a change in slope beginning four days after the burst and then a recovery at late - times due to a possible underlying supernova or host galaxy .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ]    the grb 991216 is located at galactic coordinates of @xmath37 . to remove the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction we used the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter : sfd ) .",
    "the expected galactic reddening towards the burst is substantial , @xmath2 mag .",
    "we use @xmath38 and the standard reddening curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) , as tabulated by sfd ( their table  6 ) , to correct our optical and ir data . as discussed by stanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , there is some indication that the sfd map overestimates the @xmath39 values by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 close to the galactic plane ( @xmath40 ) ( stanek 1998 ) and in high extinction ( @xmath41mag ) regions ( arce & goodman 1999 ) .",
    "it is not clear at all that such a correction should be applied to the sfd @xmath39 value for the grb 991216 , but it would reduce this value to about @xmath42 .",
    "we synthesize the @xmath28 spectrum from our data by interpolating the magnitudes to a common time .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the colors of the grb 991216 counterpart do not show significant variation .",
    "we therefore select an epoch of dec .",
    "18.32 ut ( @xmath43 hours after the burst ) for the color analysis , which is near the time when simultaneous @xmath28 data were taken .",
    "we convert the @xmath28 magnitudes to fluxes using the effective wavelengths and normalizations of fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa ( 1995 ) for the optical and mgessier ( 1995 ) for the ir .",
    "these conversions are accurate to about 5% , which increases the error - bars correspondingly .",
    "note that while the error in the @xmath39 reddening value has not been applied to the error - bars of individual points , we include it in the error budget of the fitted slope .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  3 for both the observed and the dereddened magnitudes .",
    "the corrected spectrum is well fitted by a single power - law with @xmath44 .",
    "if we use the lower value of @xmath42 , as discussed above , the corresponding number is @xmath45 .",
    "we have assumed that there is no extinction within the host galaxy , but any reddening from the host will make the intrinsic spectrum more flat and reduce the derived value of @xmath46 .",
    "a radio observation ( taylor & berger 1999 ; frail et al . 2000 ) found the afterglow at 8.5 ghz to be 960@xmath47 @xmath48jy on 1999 dec .",
    "adjusting our @xmath23-band flux to this date , we find a power - law index between the radio and near - ir to be @xmath49 , much more shallow than the index between the near - ir and the optical .",
    "the chandra x - ray observatory also observed the grb on dec 18.2 ( ut ) ( piro  1999 ) and converting to a flux density we find a power - law index between the ir and x - ray points of @xmath50 , slightly steeper than a simple extrapolation from the ir / optical data .",
    "we note that this slope is close to what is found for the ir / optical data if the extinction is set to the lower value of the range discussed above .",
    "figure  4 shows the overall spectrum from the radio to the x - rays and evidence for a spectra break at frequencies less than the @xmath23-band .",
    "[ fig : fullspectrum ]    the grb afterglow model described by sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) can be used to compare the spectral and temporal power - law indices observed .",
    "the ir / optical region is within the cooling regime ( figure  4 ) , so the observed spectral slope of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for ir to x - ray ) gives an estimate of the electron distribution index of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . for a spherical shock",
    ", we then expect a temporal index of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) which is much more shallow than the observed index . for a jet ,",
    "however , the expected light curve index is @xmath57 ( @xmath54 ) , close to the observed value of 1.4 . at frequencies less than the cooling break",
    ", we expect a spectral index of 0.1 based on the ir / optical slope .",
    "this is similar to the observed index of 0.15 , but it should be noted that other spectral breaks may be present between the radio and ir points .",
    "we present well - calibrated @xmath28 observations of the grb  991216 .",
    "our data indicates that the decay of the optical afterglow is well represented by a single power - law with index @xmath30 from 0.5 days to four days after the burst . combining published late - time @xmath24-band observations with our data suggests a single power - law is a good fit out to 20 days after the burst .    the optical spectral energy distribution , corrected for significant galactic reddening , is well fitted by a single power - law with an index of @xmath44 .",
    "however , when the possible systematic error in the sfd extinction map is considered , the index may be somewhat steeper ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "a chandra x - ray observation obtained near the time of our photometry provides a spectral index between the near ir and x - rays of @xmath50 .",
    "a comparison between the spectral and temporal power - law indices suggest that the grb is not consistent with a simple spherical shock model .",
    "the ir / optical light curve and colors are better matched by a shock produced from a collimated jet .",
