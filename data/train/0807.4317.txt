    "cosmological observations rely on three pivotal data sets , i.e. the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , the determinations of the matter power spectrum from galaxy surveys and the supernova light curve observations .",
    "the large - scale measurements are inextricably bound to the model used to interpret the data . consequently the three aforementioned data sets are jointly analyzed in terms of a standard scenario which is often dubbed @xmath0cdm paradigm , where @xmath0 qualifies the dark energy component and cdm denotes the cold dark matter component . while all the current observations are based , directly or indirectly , on the electromagnetic spectrum ,",
    "there is the hope , in the future , that the electromagnetic observations could be complemented by the analysis of the spectrum of the relic gravitons which have been produced both in the context of the @xmath0cdm paradigm as well as in other related contexts .",
    "the problem is , therefore , twofold : on the one hand reliable estimates of the spectrum of the relic gravitons arising in the @xmath0cdm paradigm are needed . on the other hand it will be important to analyze other complementary scenarios .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to address both issues in quantitative terms .",
    "the relic graviton background produced in the context of the @xmath0cdm paradigm is expected to be rather minute and undetectable by wide - band interferometers @xcite in one of their future realizations .",
    "there are , however , extensions of the @xmath0cdm scenario where the signal potentially detectable by wide - band interferometers is much larger than in the current paradigm .",
    "the recent wmap 5-yr data @xcite set quite stringent bounds on the amplitude of the relic graviton spectral energy density for typical frequency scales : will be consistently adopted all along the present investigation . ]",
    "@xmath2 where , according to the prefixes of the international system of units , @xmath3 hz . the wavenumber @xmath4 is also called sometimes pivot scale corresponds to an effective multipole @xmath5 . ] since it is customary , in the experimental analyses of cmb data @xcite , to assign the amplitude of the scalar and tensor modes exactly at @xmath4 . in the same units of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the typical frequency interval potentially accessible to the observations of the wide - band interferometers ranges between few hz and @xmath6 khz with a peak of sensitivity around @xmath7hz .    the logic followed in the present investigation will be to compute as accurately as possible the relic graviton spectra in terms of the parameters of the putative @xmath0cdm paradigm .",
    "the cmb data will then be used to enforce the normalization of the spectra at @xmath8 .",
    "this will allow for the estimate of the spectral energy density at the frequency explored by wide - band interferometers ( i.e. , approximately , @xmath7 hz ) not only in the case of the @xmath0cdm paradigm but also in the context of its extensions .",
    "the latter extensions will be examined on the basis of their plausibility , e.g. the models which are already incompatible ( or barely compatible ) with cmb observations will not be analyzed and the attention will be focussed on those scenarios which are not ruled out by ( current ) large - scale observations and which may lead to a potentially large signal at the wide - band interferometer scale . in the present introductory section , after a general discussion of the typical frequencies of the graviton spectrum , the present status of cmb observations and wide - band interferometers observations will be swiftly discussed . specific attention",
    "will be paid to those quantitative aspects which are germane to our theme , i.e. the stochastic backgrounds of relic gravitons .",
    "some of the concepts introduced here will also be more specifically addressed in the forthcoming sections . at the end of this introduction",
    ", the purposes of the present investigation will be more specifically outlined .      to compare frequencies",
    "it is mandatory to specify the background and the appropriate conventions on the normalization of the scale factor .",
    "consistently with the @xmath0cdm paradigm , the background geometry will be taken to be conformally flat , i.e. @xmath9 ,   \\qquad \\overline{g}_{\\mu\\nu } = a^2(\\tau ) \\eta_{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the minkowski metric with signature mostly minus , i.e. @xmath11 . the scale factor at the present time will be normalized to unity , i.e. @xmath12 . within the latter convention , the comoving frequencies ( or wavelengths ) coincide , at the present time , with the physical frequencies ( or wavelengths ) .",
    "the ( conformal ) time derivative of the logarithm of the scale factor will be used throughout the script and it is defined as @xmath13 note that , in eq .",
    "( [ t7a ] ) , the prime denotes a derivation with respect to the conformal time coordinate @xmath14 : this notation will be consistently enforced in the whole investigation .",
    "the evolution of the background can be expressed in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and it is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote , respectively , the total energy density and the total pressure of the plasma .    the frequency of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be usefully compared with two other important frequencies , i.e. the frequency of matter - radiation equality ( be it @xmath20 ) and the frequency of neutrino decoupling ( which also coincides , in loose terms , with the hubble radius at the onset of big bang nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "these two frequencies can then be written , respectively , as : @xmath21 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote , respectively , the present critical fraction of matter and radiation with typical values drawn from the best fit to the wmap 5-yr data alone and within the @xmath0cdm paradigm . in eq .",

    ", @xmath25 is rather in the nhz range .",
    "the success of the cmb and bbn calculations implicitly demands that , after neutrino decoupling , the universe was already dominated by radiation . if we assume that the radiation dominates right at the end of inflation , then the maximal frequency of the graviton spectrum can be computed and it is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the amplitude of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations evaluated at the pivot wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "between @xmath25 and @xmath28 there are roughly 20 orders of magnitude in frequency . in the @xmath0cdm scenario",
    "the relic graviton spectrum has , in this range , always the same slope .",
    "as already mentioned , cmb experiments are sensitive to long wavelength gravitons with typical frequencies of the order of @xmath29 ( see also eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "the number of cmb parameters depends upon the specific model used to interpret ( and fit ) the data .",
    "the @xmath0cdm scenario probably contains the fewest number of parameters required to have a consistent fit of cmb data .",
    "the @xmath0cdm parameters can be inferred from various experiments and , among them , a central role is played by wmap @xcite ( see also @xcite for first year data release and @xcite for the third year data release ) as well as other experiments ( see , for instance , @xcite in connection with the 5-yr wmap data release ) .",
    "the tt , te and , partially ee angular power spectra have been measured by the wmap experiment .",
    "other ( i.e. non space - borne ) experiments are now measuring polarization observables , in particular there are the 3-yr dasi release @xcite , the capmap experiment @xcite , the recent quad data @xcite , as well as various other experiments at different stages of development .",
    "the tt , te and ee power spectra are customarily analyzed in the light of the minimal @xmath0cdm scenario but also other models are possible and they include , for instance , the addition of spatial curvature ( i.e. the open-@xmath0cdm ) , more general parametrizations for the equation of state of dark - energy and so on and so forth .",
    "the combined analysis of the cmb data , of the large - scale structure data @xcite and of the supernova data @xcite can lead to quantitative upper limits on the possible contribution of the tensor modes to the initial conditions of the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "these upper limits can be phrased in terms of @xmath30 , i.e. the ratio between the power spectrum of tensor fluctuations and the power spectrum of the scalar fluctuations evaluated at the pivot wavenumber @xmath31 . in the minimal paradigm ( i.e. the @xmath0cdm scenario ) the tensor",
    "are not included in the fit .    if the inflationary phase is driven by a single scalar degree of freedom and if the radiation dominance kicks in almost suddenly after inflation ,",
    "@xmath30 not only determines the tensor amplitude but also , thanks to the algebra obeyed by the slow - roll parameters , the slope of the tensor power spectrum , customarily denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "to lowest order in the slow - roll expansion , therefore , the tensor spectral index is slightly red and it is related to @xmath30 ( and to the slow - roll parameter ) as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 measures the rate of decrease of the hubble parameter during the inflationary epoch . while the prime will denote a derivation with respect to the conformal time coordinate @xmath14 . ] within the established set of conventions the scalar spectral index @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 and it depends not only upon @xmath37 but also upon the second slow - roll parameter @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the inflaton potential , @xmath40 denotes the second derivative of the potential with respect to the inflaton field and @xmath41 ) .    depending upon the specific data used in the analysis , the upper limits on @xmath30 as well as",
    "the determination of the other cosmological parameters may change slightly .",
    ".the values of @xmath30 are reported as they have been estimated in the absence of any running of the ( scalar ) spectral index . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ mod1 ]    in tab .",
    "[ mod1 ] the upper limits on @xmath30 are illustrated as they are determined from the combination of different data sets .",
    "for illustration the determined values of the scalar spectral index ( i.e. @xmath35 ) , of the dark energy and dark matter fractions ( i.e. , respectively , @xmath42 and @xmath22 ) , and of the typical wavenumber of equality @xmath43 are also reported in the remaining columns . while different analyses can be performed ,",
    "it is clear , by looking at tab .",
    "[ mod1 ] that the typical upper bounds on @xmath30 range between , say , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "slightly more stringent limits can also be obtained by adding supplementary assumptions . within a conservative perspective , the tensor power spectra are , at least , ten times smaller than the power spectra of curvature perturbations . in the near future the planck explorer satellite @xcite might be able to set more direct limits on @xmath30 by measuring ( hopefully ) the bb angular power spectra .",
    "the e - mode power spectra and the b - mode power spectra arise as two orthogonal combinations of the stokes parameters which are frame - dependent ( i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . while the adiabatic mode leads naturally to the e - mode polarization ,",
    "the only way of obtaining the b - mode ( in the standard @xmath0cdm paradigm ) is through the contribution of the tensor modes .",
    "consequently , a detection o the bb angular power spectra would be equivalent , in the @xmath0cdm framework , to a first determination of @xmath30 .",
    "having reviewed the essentials of cmb data and their connection with the relic graviton spectra , we can now move to higher frequencies and describe the status of the other devices which could shed light on the relic gravitons , i.e. the wide - band interferometers .",
    "the wide - band interferometers operate in a window ranging from few hz up to @xmath6 khz .",
    "the available interferometers are ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , tama @xcite and geo @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of a given pair of wide - band detectors to a stochastic background of relic gravitons depends upon the relative orientation of the instruments .",
    "the wideness of the band ( important for the correlation among different instruments ) is not as large as @xmath6 khz but typically narrower and , in an optimistic perspective , it could range up to @xmath7 hz .",
    "the putative frequency of wide - band detectors will therefore be indicated as @xmath48 , i.e. in loose terms , the ligo / virgo frequency .",
    "there are daring projects of wide - band detectors in space like the lisa @xcite , the bbo @xcite and the decigo @xcite projects .",
    "the common denominator of these three projects is that they are all space - borne missions and that they are all sensitive to frequencies smaller than the mhz . while wide - band interferometers are now operating and",
    "might even reach their advanced sensitivities along the incoming decade , the achievable sensitivities of space - borne interferometers are still on the edge of the achievable technologies . since @xmath49",
    "the wide - band interferometers are an ideal instrument to investigate the relic graviton spectrum in the unknown territory where there are neither direct nor indirect tests on the thermal history of the plasma .",
    "the problem is that , as it will be carefully shown , the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons produced within the @xmath0cdm model is quite minute and it is undetectable by interferometers even in their advanced version where the sensitivity is expected to improve by 5 or even 6 orders of magnitude in comparison with the present performances @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this impasse , as previously stressed , stems from the assumption that , right after inflation , the radiation - dominated evolution kicks in almost suddenly . at the moment , there are no evidences neither in favor of such a statement nor against it",
    ". the main theme of the present investigation will be to reverse this problem .",
    "it will be argued that wide - band detectors , in their advanced version , will be certainly able to test definite deviations from a simplistic thermal history of the plasma , i.e. the one stipulating that , after inflation , the radiation was suddenly dominating the evolution .      in the present investigation the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons will be calculated first at small frequencies ( compatible with the cmb observations ) and then at higher frequencies ( compatible with the operational window of wide - band interferometers ) .",
    "the latter calculation will be performed both n the case of the @xmath0cdm paradigm but also in those extensions which may lead to a large spectral energy density at the scale of the wide - band interferometers without violating any of the bounds stemming from cmb observations .",
    "the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons will be introduced in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "gravity is inherently a non - abelian gauge theory there are potential ambiguities in defining univocally an energy - momentum ( pseudo)-tensor for the relic gravitons : it will be shown that different choices of the energy - momentum pseudo - tensor lead to the same spectral energy density of the relic gravitons .",
    "the punch line of section [ sec2 ] will be that the spectral energy density can be more accurately performed with numerical methods rather than resorting , as often done , to semi - analytical estimates which amount to estimate first the power spectrum and then the spectral energy density .    in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "using the numerical techniques introduced in section [ sec2 ] , the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons will be computed in the case of the standard @xmath0cdm paradigm which leads to nearly scale - invariant spectra .",
    "the signal arising in the context of the @xmath0cdm paradigm will be confronted with the sensitivity of wide - band interferometers .    after showing the compatibility of the new methods with the results of the nearly scale - invariant spectra , possible scaling violations in the spectral energy density will be discussed in section [ sec4 ] . while in the @xmath0cdm paradigm the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons",
    "is nearly scale invariant it is plausible to construct a class of models where the spectral energy density is fully compatible with the cmb and with the large - scale data at low frequencies while it is potentially detectable by wide - band interferometers .",
    "when we say that it is plausible this simply means that it is not forbidden by any of the current observational data .",
    "the proposed extensions of the @xmath0cdm paradigm have also a physical interpretation ( see section [ sec4 ] ) since they naturally arise when the thermal history of the universe deviates , for sufficiently early times , from the usual assumptions of the @xmath0cdm scenario which stipulates that , right after inflation , the universe suddenly becomes dominated by radiation .",
    "the minimal realization of the ideas pursued in section [ sec4 ] is scrutinized in section [ sec5 ] and it is dubbed t@xmath0cdm scenario ( for tensor-@xmath0cdm ) .",
    "the t@xmath0cdm paradigm consists of two supplementary parameters , i.e. , in broad terms , a new pivotal frequency and a new spectral slope .",
    "the new frequency marks the onset of the high - frequency branch of the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "the t@xmath0cdm paradigm is compatible with the current bounds stemming not only from cmb and large - scale structure .",
    "it will also be required that the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) as well as pulsar timing constraints are satisfied and this will allow to spell out quantitatively the restrictions on the two supplementary parameters characterizing the t@xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "the basic technical tools required to pursue the present analysis will be hereby summarized . the first part of the present section ( i.e. subsection [ sec2aa ] ) contains an introduction to the basic terminology and a swift derivation of the main equations .",
    "subsections [ sec2a ] and [ sec2b ] contain the details of our numerical approach whose results will also be illustrated in various physically relevant examples ( see subsection [ excalc ] ) and compared to the corresponding semi - analytical estimates ( see subsection [ sec2c ] ) .",
