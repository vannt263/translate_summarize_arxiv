    "in statistics , the beta distribution is a well - known and established model to fit continuous bounded data . a random variable @xmath6 following a beta distribution with shape parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 has density function given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the beta function ; we denote @xmath11 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the interval @xmath12 since a beta distribution on an interval @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) is obtained by the simple linear transformation @xmath15 .    as an alternative to the beta distribution",
    ", @xcite introduced a two - parameter distribution on @xmath16 , the so - called kumaraswamy distribution .",
    "a random variable @xmath17 following a kumaraswamy distribution has density given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shape parameters .",
    "we denote @xmath21 .",
    "similarly as discussed above , we also restrict our attention to the kumaraswamy distribution on the interval @xmath12 .",
    "the kumaraswamy distribution was initially proposed for applications in hydrology . since then",
    ", it has been frequently used in several areas of statistics in the last years .",
    "for instance , see the most recent papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references contained therein .",
    "one factor for this increased interesting on the kumaraswamy distribution is due to its simple mathematical form of the distribution function , in constrast with the beta distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the ordinary moments of the beta distribution are obtained explicitly , while those of the kumaraswamy distribution depend on the gamma function . there",
    "exist several advantages ( and evidently disadvantages ) of the kumaraswamy distribution over the beta distribution .",
    "we recommend the paper by @xcite to the readers interested in a detailed comparison between the beta and kumaraswamy distributions",
    ".    nowadays , the beta and kumaraswamy distributions are the most popular models to fit continuous bounded data .",
    "further , these models have many features in common and in a practical situation one question of interest is how to select the most adequate model ( between the beta and kumaraswamy distributions ) to fit a certain continuous bounded data set .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , it does not exist a way to discriminate the beta and kumaraswamy models . in practical situations , the akaike criteria has been used to do this , but this relies only on checking what is the model with great value of the maximized log - likelihood ( since both have the same number of parameters ) .",
    "our chief goal in this paper is to propose a selection criterion between the beta and kumaraswamy distributions based on the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic proposed by @xcite . with this",
    ", we obtain the probability of correct selection under the hypotheses that the data comes from the beta or kumaraswamy distributions and select the model that maximizes it .    in a pioneering work ,",
    "@xcite proposed a way to discriminate non - nested families of hypotheses .",
    "the test statistic is the logarithm of the ratio of the maximized log - likelihoods under both null and alternative hypotheses .",
    "this statistic is compared with its expected value under the null hypothesis .",
    "small deviations of the expected mean imply evidences in favor of the null hypothesis , while large deviations indicate evidences against . in a non - rigorous way",
    ", @xcite showed that the normalized logarithm of the ratio of the maximized log - likelihoods is asymptotically normal distributed .",
    "regularity conditions and a rigorous proof of the asymptotic normality of the cox s test statistic was provided by @xcite .",
    "the major part of the works dealing on this subject lies in discriminating between two non - nested lifetime distributions .",
    "for instance , see the papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "references about discrimination between separate families of hypotheses are widespread and we recommend the reader to see references contained in the above papers .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section  [ likelihoodratiotest ]",
    "we present the test statistic to discriminate beta and kumaraswamy models and obtain its asymptotic distribution under two null hypotheses ( that are , data come from the beta or kumaraswamy distributions ) . in section [ selectionmodel ]",
    "we present our selection criterion based on the results given in the previous section . the minimum sample size required to discriminate beta and kumaraswamy distributions when the probability of correct selection is beforehand",
    "is provided in section  [ mss ] .",
    "simulation issues and two applications to real data sets involving proportions are presented in sections  [ simulation ] and  [ applications ] , respectively .",
    "let @xmath22 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables , with observed values @xmath23 , either from a @xmath24 distribution or @xmath25 distribution , with densities given by ( [ pdfbeta ] ) and ( [ pdfkw ] ) , respectively .",
    "these hypotheses are denoted by @xmath26    the log - likelihood function associated to the beta distribution is given by @xmath27    the maximum likelihood estimates ( mles ) @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , are obtained as solutions of the nonlinear equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the digamma function . on the other hand , the log - likelihood function corresponding to the kumaraswamy distribution is @xmath32 the mles @xmath33 and @xmath34 of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , are the solution of the nonlinear system of equations @xmath37    with the above results , we define our test statistic by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the mles of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . in words , our test statistic is the difference between the maximized log - likelihoods .",
    "since both models have the same number of parameters , this corresponds to the akaike statistic ( @xcite ) .",
    "more explicitly , the statistic @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath43 + n(\\widehat a_n - \\widehat \\alpha_n)\\left[\\psi(\\widehat a_n ) - \\psi(\\widehat a_n + \\widehat b_n)\\right]\\\\ & + & n(\\widehat b_n - 1)\\left[\\psi(\\widehat b_n ) - \\psi(\\widehat a_n + \\widehat b_n)\\right]+ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\log(1-x^{\\widehat \\alpha_n})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in practical situations , based on the akaike criterion , the following selection criterion is commonly adopted : we choose the beta distribution if @xmath44 , otherwise we choose the kumaraswamy distribution .",
    "we here adopt a different selection criterion , which is based on the asymptotic distribution of a normalized version of @xmath0 under the hypotheses @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this criterion will be present in the next section .",
    "now we concentrate our attention to find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic .",
    "we now define some function which will appear along the paper . for @xmath47 , define the real functions @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 ^ 2+\\psi'(1)-\\psi'((x+k)z^{-1}+1)\\}}{\\gamma(y - k)k!(x+k)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the first derivative of the digamma function @xmath54 .",
    "in this subsection we present the asymptotic distribution of @xmath0 under the hypothesis @xmath55 .",
    "the alternative hypothesis is @xmath56 .",
    "suppose that the random variables @xmath57 come from the @xmath24 distribution .",
    "for any borel measurable function @xmath58 , the underscript @xmath59 in @xmath60 means that the expectation is taken with respect to the beta distribution with density given by ( [ pdfbeta ] ) .",
    "more explicitly , we have @xmath61 .",

    "the above convergences follow from the results stated and proved by @xcite .",
    "we now discuss how to obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
