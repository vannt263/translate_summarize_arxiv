    "the equations describing radial motions of isotropic elastic materials admit a special weak solution describing a cavity that emerges at a point from a homogeneously deformed state .",
    "cavitating solutions are self - similar in nature and were introduced by ball @xcite and by pericak - spector and spector @xcite .",
    "they turn out to decrease the total mechanical energy and provide a striking example of non - uniqueness of entropy weak solutions for polyconvex energies @xcite .",
    "there is a class of problems in solid mechanics , such as fracture , cavitation or shear bands , where discontinuous motions emerge from smooth motions via a mechanism of material instability .",
    "any attempt to study such solutions that lie at the limits of continuum modeling needs to reckon with the problem of giving a proper definition for such solutions .",
    "once the material breaks or a shear band forms the motion can no longer be described at the level of continuum modeling and microscopic modeling or higher - order regularizing mechanisms have to be taken into account .",
    "still , as such structures develop there is expected an intermediate time scale where both types of modeling apply . in these lecture notes",
    "we present the notion of singular limiting induced from continuum solution ( or slic - solution ) @xcite , stating that a discontinuous motion is a slic - solution if its averages are a family of smooth approximate solutions to the problem .",
    "the lecture notes are based on two recent works on cavity formation @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite complements @xcite and establishes various further properties of weak solutions describing cavitation , in particular indicating that cavity formation is necessarily associated with a unique precursor shock . in @xcite",
    "the notion of singular limiting induced from continuum solution is introduced and applied to the problem of cavity formation .",
    "it is shown that there is an energetic cost for creating the cavity , which is captured by slic - solutions but neglected by the usual entropic weak solutions .",
    "once this surface energy cost is accounted for , the paradox of nonuniqueness is removed , in the sense that the cavitating solution together with the surface energy of the cavity has higher energy than the homogeneous deformation .",
    "the structure of these notes is as follows : in section [ sec - eqel ] we present the system of elasticity and the general requirements imposed by mechanical considerations and discuss various notions of relaxed convexity hypotheses associated to elasticity . in section [ sec - radel ] we introduce the equations of radial elasticity applicable to isotropic elastic materials . in section [ sec - cavi ]",
    "we present the problem of cavitation and outline the construction and properties of weak solutions describing cavity formation from a homogeneously deformed state . in section [ sec - frac ]",
    "we introduce an illuminating example for fracture in 1-d and in section [ sec - slic ] the concept of singular limiting induced from continuum solutions which gives an interpretation to this example as a solution of the equations of one - dimensional elasticity .",
    "it is shown that there is an additional contribution from the opening crack to the resulting energy of the fracturing solution . in section [ sec - sliccav ] , the notion of slic - solution is extended for the cavitation problem and the effect of this concept to the energy of the cavitating solution is calculated .",
    "it turms out that the slic - solution provides a more discriminating concept of solution for strong singularities .",
    "the equations of elasticity is the system of nonlinear partial differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the motion . it is customary to introduce the velocity @xmath2 and the deformation gradient @xmath3 and to write as a first order hyperbolic system @xmath4 the last equation stands for a constraint that ensures that @xmath5 is a gradient",
    "this constraint does not cause problems as it is an involution @xcite , that is if it is satisfied for the initial data then it is propagated by @xmath6 to the solutions . in the hypothesis of hyperelasticity , @xmath7 ,",

    "the issue in the background is that , due to the lack of convexity of @xmath14 , the entropy @xmath18 is not convex . on the other hand the standard theory of systems of conservation laws",
    "is intricately connected to convexity and is inapplicable in a direct way .",

    "a lot of effort has been devoted into finding suitable notions to replace the assumption of convexity , starting from works on the calculus of variations associated to the minimization of potential energy .",

    "the reader is referred to @xcite for precise statements and their proofs , the introduction of null - lagrangeans into the theory of elasticity is due to ericksen @xcite and edelen @xcite and their role in the mathematical theory of elasticity is pointed out by ball @xcite .",
    "their importance arises from the fact that null - lagrangeans are weakly continuous in @xmath27 @xcite , and from their role in the existence theory of equilibrium elasticity @xcite and in obtaining symmetrizable extensions for polyconvex elastodynamics @xcite .    here",
