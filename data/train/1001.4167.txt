    "interest in ultracold atoms with dipole - dipole interactions arise due to the long range and anisotropic nature of dipolar forces .",
    "if the dipolar fermi gas is fully polarized the anisotropic form of the interactions leads to a distortion of the fermi surface ( fs ) ( ref . , and appendix a ) and to a mixing of the collective excitations due to the structure of the fermi liquid parameters.@xcite although this system can be described in terms of the standard landau theory of the fermi liquid@xcite important changes are needed to account for the effects of the dipolar forces.@xcite recent theoretical work has revealed that gases of dipolar fermi atomic systems can exhibit interesting and unconventional properties , including novel ordered quantum liquid crystal states , such as biaxial nematic and ferronematic phases@xcite .",
    "quantum liquid crystal phases have been conjectured to play an important role in the physics of strongly correlated systems@xcite .",
    "recent experimental progress in trapping strongly magnetic dipolar fermi gases in magnetic traps opens the way to study these interesting physical systems in the laboratory.@xcite    dipolar fermi systems where spin degrees of freedom are allowed to play a dynamical role @xcite are much less studied .",
    "magnetic dipole - dipole interactions , unlike electric dipole - dipole interactions , conserve total angular momentum , spin + orbital ( @xmath3),@xcite , and hence mix the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "interactions in dense nuclear matter with non - central forces are similar .",
    "in fact , many of the above effects have been studied theoretically in the nuclear physics literature.@xcite    in this work we consider , in perturbation theory , the effects of _ magnetic _ dipolar forces on a spin- fermi system with a population imbalance of particles originally in eigenstates of the @xmath4 pauli matrix , corresponding to a partially polarized ferronematic state.@xcite to first order in the interaction , he local spin quantization axis is not along @xmath5 , leading to an effective spin - orbit type interaction for the quasiparticles , whose self - energy develops a spin structure in _ momentum space_. in an earlier publication we showed that the qualitative physics of the ferronematic phase can be captured by the structure of the fermi surfaces .",
    "the results we present here show that the nature of the ordered state at partial polarization has a complex , unconventional ( i.e. , a spin triplet particle - hole condensate anisotropic in orbital space ) , magnetic order associated with the dynamically generated spin - orbit type interactions .",
    "such a system can be simulated experimentally with two hyperfine levels of @xmath6dy in an optical trap at zero external magnetic field.@xcite    we define the dipolar interaction parameter as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the magnetic moment of the particles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is defined by the average chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "our calculations are to first order in @xmath12 , but the physical principles we describe are quite general .",
    "we do not consider here important questions such as pairing effects , collapse instabilities@xcite , temperature or optical trap effects .",
    "the physics we describe does not rely on trap parameters ; such effects could be taken into account using thomas - fermi functionals.@xcite collapse instabilities , that we will not consider here , require a finite dipolar coupling strength even for long range forces@xcite whereas the phenomena we study occurs for infinitesimal dipolar couplings .    before presenting the details",
    "we summarize the physical picture that emerges as follows .",
    "a fixed difference of particles in the eigenstates of @xmath4 creates a net magnetization of the system which then acts , as far as static processes are concerned , as a uniform external magnetic field along @xmath5 . in the absence of magnetic field",
    "the dipole interaction conserves the spin + orbital angular momentum ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "crucially , in the presence of a net magnetization the colliding particles still conserve the @xmath0-projection of the total angular momentum , @xmath14 along the magnetization . recall that the magnetic dipole interaction is an @xmath15 object under rotations of the spatial coordinates@xcite and",
    "that , unlike contact , coulomb or exchange interactions , the dipolar forces can flip the spin of one of the two interacting particles . to conserve angular momentum",
    "the missing momentum is taken from the orbital degrees of freedom . in a many - body system",
    "this means that any given particle will `` feel '' an average magnetic field due to the interaction with other particles . in other words ,",
    "the mean field is a vector not a scalar .",
    "this molecular magnetic field is capable of flipping the spin of the spin- and hence it must point away from the the @xmath0-axis .",
    "moreover since @xmath16 must be conserved the change in spin angular momentum due to a spin flip process must be accompanied by a corresponding change in orbital ( momentum space ) angular momentum . in this way we arrive at the conclusion that the distribution in momentum space of the particles must be anisotropic and that the spin state of the particle will depend on its velocity !    since the local spin quantization axis is not parallel to the polarization direction @xmath5 , the @xmath1-dependent spin state of the particles becomes a linear combinations of eigenstates of @xmath4 , i.e. , the spins tilt .",
    "interestingly , we find that neither the tilting angle nor the momentum distribution of the quasiparticles are isotropic in momentum space , and vary with direction as @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively because of the mixing of orbital and spin degrees of freedom . this can be described in perturbation theory as arising from two processes : a ) @xmath19 ( no spin flip ) , with @xmath20 ; since we consider particles with no internal structure , the quasiparticle self - energy acquires a correction of the form @xmath18 , b ) @xmath21 ( spin flip ) with @xmath22 , the quasiparticle self - energy gets a correction of the form @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the self - energy now has an off - diagonal momentum - dependent component .",
    "these changes in the structure of the self - energy lead to qualitative modifications to the quasiparticle distribution functions and of the fermi surface .",
    "in particular it is no longer possible to define separate fermi surfaces for up and down fermions independently .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : single_particle_states ] we investigate the structure of the single particles states and show how the orbital and spin degrees of freedom become entangled due to the presence of non - diagonal elements in the self energy of particles . in section",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we provide possible scenarios where dipolar effects may be observed .",
    "finally the appendices provide the details of the self energy computations for the fully polarized and partially polarized case ( appendix [ app : self_energy_fully_polarized ] and [ app : self - energys11ands12 ] ) , an intuitive explanation of the fs distortion ( appendix [ app : distortion ] ) and details of the fourier transform of the dipolar interaction ( appendix [ app : fourier ] ) .",
    "the excitations of a gas of fermions at finite density are quasiparticles with the same quantum numbers as the fermions .",
    "however their dynamics is strongly affected by their mutual interactions .",
    "these physical effects are captured by the quasiparticle self - energy . in the presence of dipole - dipole interactions the form of the self energy",

    "a possible stabilizing mechanism is provided by a stoner - type of effective interaction@xcite which was not considered in the present work .",
    "another possibility is to choose two hyperfine states for which conservation of angular momentum would strongly limit the phase space available for particles to decay into .",
    "if this is true for dy then there is no need to invoke the stoner mechanism .",
    "a second possibility is the use of an optical lattice loaded with hyperfine states of @xmath6dy .",
    "this method has certain advantages as far as stability is concerned @xcite and might also make the dipolar effects much more pronounced . by working with a small filling fraction to avoid a large same - site interaction and umklapp processes it may be possible to make the dipole interaction be the dominant energy scale    another important experimental question is the possible presence of external stray magnetic fields . in the present work we already assumed a fixed external zeeman field .",
