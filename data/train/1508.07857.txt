    "activity in neuronal networks influences their coupling structure due to spike time - dependent synaptic plasticity ( stdp ) @xcite , which , in turn , influences the activity .",
    "several works analytically investigated structures appearing in networks of neurons with plastic synapses under the influence of external signals .",
    "these studies required special network architectures , investigating e.g. a kind of possible elementary cell of the network @xcite or considered all - to - all connected networks @xcite or averages over activity realizations in space @xcite or systems without continuous spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "hebbian @xcite and similar learning rules , which can be considered as a simple stdp - like rules , are used in many neural network models , like e.g. hopfield and boltzmann networks @xcite .",
    "these works employ the energy minimization principle known in physics and set the values of synaptic weights according to the patterns to be stored , without considering the time evolution of the weights explicitly .",
    "these systems are able to store one level associations between patterns and recognize and restore externally applied and previously learned patterns .",
    "the memory capacity as well as times to recognize an input have been investigated @xcite .",
    "activity propagation in non - plastic feed - forward systems was considered in @xcite .",
    "a set of integro - differential equations , describing a spatially extended network , was introduced in @xcite as the neural field model .",
    "a scheme of solution for a simplified version neglecting refractoriness @xcite was later extended for neurons with adaptation @xcite and different non - linearities @xcite .",
    "the spatial and structural organization of cortex @xcite separates different neural inputs either in real space or in an effective space that represents a continuum of features .",
    "for example , the orientation selectivity of neurons in visual cortex is represented by neurons topologically arranged on a one dimensional ring @xcite .",
    "one suggested mechanism @xcite to implement short - term memory is by localized bump solutions , which are also considered in @xcite .",
    "the latter work shows the relation between the formalism of reaction - diffusion - like systems and spatially extended non - plastic neural networks .",
    "our work demonstrates such a relation for neural networks with long term plasticity .",
    "the formalism thus fills the gap between a series of studies of plastic networks without spatial dimension and the formalism describing activity in spatially extended networks .",
    "the presented analysis therefore opens the possibility to study the transfer of short - term memory , encoded by bump solutions , into long - term memory , stored by synaptic modifications .",
    "here we analytically consider a feed - forward network with space - dependent connectivity and linear - non - linear neurons with a simple stdp - inspired synaptic learning rule , similar to the bcm rule @xcite .",
    "we reduce the discrete problem by diffusion approximation to obtain an equation similar but not exactly equivalent to a reaction - diffusion equation with one component , also called kolmogorov - petrovsky - piskounov equation @xcite .",
    "we derive the requirements on the non - linearity necessary for a regime of stable signal propagation , exposing that fine - tuning of parameters is necessary , explaining earlier results @xcite .",
    "the bump solutions that are stable in the critical and meta - stable in the subcritical regime are described analytically .",
    "the interneural connections inside a bump are strengthened , resembling cell assemblies @xcite and showing how externally presented objects ( external input ) change intrinsic system properties ( connectivity ) .",
    "we further consider the interaction between bump solutions in dependence of their size , the distance between them , and the system parameters .",
    "in the regime close to stable propagation we find that several coexisting activity bumps can either unite with each other or remain disjoint , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "their unification can be interpreted as an emergence of connections between cell - assemblies , and , in this way , represents a system of associations between internal representations of corresponding external stimuli .",
    "the improved formalism can be generalized to neural networks with several neuron types and to some extent mapped onto the time evolution of a recurrent network , opening the possibility for further investigations .",
    "here we consider feed forward networks consisting of @xmath0 layers of @xmath1 neurons each .",
    "a neuron at position @xmath2 in layer @xmath3 gets as input @xmath4 the weighted sum of outputs @xmath5 of an odd number @xmath6 of neurons from the neighborhood in the previous layer @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where the indices @xmath2 and @xmath9 describe the positions of the postsynaptic neuron in the layer @xmath3 , and of the presynaptic neuron in the layer @xmath7 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath10 is the synaptic weight from neuron @xmath9 to neuron @xmath11 the neuron s output @xmath12 is its input @xmath13 mapped by the non - linear function @xmath14 .",
    "this network architecture is illustrated in .",
    "the absence of feedback allows the solution of the system , finding the activities and synaptic weights for each pair of layers separately using the solution of the previous pair as an input .    ]",
    "we assume a hebbian plasticity rule    @xmath15    for the presynaptic neuron @xmath9 and the postsynaptic neuron @xmath2 , which is similar to the bcm rule @xcite , but without the `` sliding '' threshold in the non - linearity @xmath14 . as a result ,",
    "the function @xmath14 keeps its sign . for simulations we used @xmath16 .",
    "if a stationary solution exists it can be found requiring @xmath17 as @xmath18 in the following we use @xmath19 as the summed input to the postsynaptic neuron to better distinguish it from the presynaptic neuron s @xmath13 .    in equilibrium ,",
    "after the learning processes stopped , @xmath20 is to be found as a solution of the self - consistent equation @xmath21 with @xmath22 and the symbol @xmath23 denoting the inverse function . in the approximation neglecting further derivatives ( and being exact for @xmath24 and @xmath25 denoting the discrete lattice derivative )",
    "one can replace @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 . in doing so",
    ", we also make the transition from a discrete index @xmath9 to a continuous variable , also denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "so , processes in the system can be considered as an interplay between the diffusion described by the @xmath29-operator and the explicit ( given by @xmath14 ) and implicit non - linearities , due to the term @xmath30 in resulting from plasticity .",
    "the equation can be rewritten in this approximation as    @xmath31      one can search for possible stable solutions @xmath32 , satisfying    @xmath33    where @xmath34 .",
    "there are no terms explicitly depending on the variable @xmath9 , so one can reduce the order of the equation by introducing @xmath35(r)$ ] the derivative of @xmath5 depending on @xmath5 .",
    "we can hence express the second derivatives in as @xmath36 where we used the substitution @xmath37 in the last step .",
    "eq . then takes the form of a linear differential equation in @xmath38    @xmath39    replacing @xmath40 in the first line with @xmath41 in the second line .",
    "the solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation @xmath42 is @xmath43 ( with an arbitrary constant @xmath44 ) , and as solution of one gets    @xmath45    where we used that the factor in front of @xmath46 cancels with @xmath47 . as @xmath38 is the square of a real number and",
    "hence can not be negative , a solution existing for all @xmath5 ( starting from @xmath48 ) has to satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "we are seeking for solutions that start at @xmath48 .",
    "we call @xmath50 the largest value of @xmath5 reached , for which @xmath51 and therefore @xmath52 from which follows    @xmath53    for this case @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the stable solution @xmath56 are shown in .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath55 is the competition between the non - linearity @xmath14 and the effective non - linearity @xmath57 that describe the propagation of @xmath5 neglecting diffusion : @xmath57 is the value of a postsynaptic neuron s membrane potential @xmath20 for the case that presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons have @xmath58 .",
    "so , a positive @xmath55 indicates a decrease of @xmath13 and @xmath5 from one layer to the next , and negative @xmath55 corresponds to both measures increasing .",
    "so , in a stable system we must have @xmath59 for all @xmath60 . by definition , @xmath61 for @xmath48 .",
    "if there are no other @xmath5 at which @xmath61 , there exists no self - consistent solution propagating from layer to layer without change .",
    "if one tries to construct the stable solution according to for this case , one will always have positive @xmath62 for every @xmath63 , which means that for every @xmath63 external support is needed to compensate the diffusion effects , and without it every finite signal will decay after some layers .",
    "for the case of the presence of an @xmath5 with @xmath61 , a solution exists having this @xmath5 as the maximum .",
    "if @xmath64 at that point is negative , an arbitrary small positive perturbation added to this maximum @xmath5 will grow .",
    "so , @xmath65 for some @xmath5 means the absence of a stable solution and explosion of activity for sufficiently strong activation patterns .",
    "the solution is given in the form @xmath66 , where the choice of a positive or negative sign in taking the square root corresponds to a solution that is first increasing or decreasing , respectively , when moving from left to right .",
    "the length of a `` plateau '' with @xmath51 and @xmath67 is an arbitrary parameter of the solution which can be chosen freely . if two such solutions coexists , they lead to the growth of @xmath5 in the region between borders of their plateaus and to their junction to one without the external borders changing .",

    "the bump solutions propagate over large but finite numbers of layers before they disappear .",
    "this number is approximately proportional to the initial width @xmath83 of the plateau : for @xmath83 larger than @xmath6 , the successive reduction of this width does not affect the processes on the borders , and the velocity @xmath84 , i.e.the rate of reduction of the plateau s width from layer to layer , is approximately constant , depending only on network parameters as shown in .",

    "the chain rule allows the replacement of @xmath25 with @xmath98 , in this way one can express @xmath84 in terms of the integral of the function containing @xmath99 over @xmath5 .     near its minimum close to but bigger than @xmath70 . *",

    "two such bumps can unite into one if the minimal amplitude of @xmath5 between their borders becomes big enough for self - generated growth before one of the plateaus disappears .    without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath102 for the midpoint between the bumps . if the distance between the two closer ends of the bumps plateaus is larger than some critical value , the minimal @xmath103 at the minimum position @xmath102 decays .",
    "one can roughly estimate the change @xmath104 of @xmath105 from one layer to the next , approximating @xmath56 near @xmath102 with the direct sum of the two bumps wings , i.e. @xmath106 with @xmath107 denoting a wing of a bump with @xmath108 at the plateau s edge .",

    "we obtain equations describing the propagation of activity from layer to layer in feed - forward networks of nonlinear rate neurons with an stdp - inspired plasticity rule .",
    "we find that the stability of the considered network is determined by the sign of the minimum of the function @xmath54 : for positive sign , every perturbation decays , for negative sign activity explodes for any sufficiently strong perturbation . if the minimum is @xmath70 , stable attractive solutions exist .",
    "they have an analytically obtained form containing a plateau of variable width .",
    "so , precise tuning of parameters is required to get stable propagation of activity patterns unchanged from layer to layer , in agreement with earlier simulation results of @xcite .",
    "a sigmoidal form of the nonlinearity @xmath14 can help to get an alteration of the signs of @xmath117 , necessary to ensure the existence of a minimum of @xmath61 at a non - vanishing activity level @xmath63 .",
    "a sigmoidal @xmath14 is therefore a natural choice to bring the system close to criticality .",
    "the qualitative form of the gain function found here is in line with the sigmoidal form derived in @xcite for feed - forward classification networks .",
    "the argumentation and the network model of this earlier work are , however , quite different .",
    "their model does not include spatial organization .",
    "rather , the authors find the sigmoid resulting from the requirement of optimal stability in the recognition of presented and previously learned patterns , without investigating the learning process itself .",
    "for the latter they employ the known error backpropagation mechanism , fixing the synaptic weights prior to the consideration of the neuronal activation dynamics",
    ". employing field theoretic arguments , the sigmoid is found as a soliton ( kink ) solution , where the input strength to the nonlinearity plays the role of space .",
    "the dissipative soliton solutions in our work , in contrast , are solutions in real space .",
    "similar long - living bump solutions exist in systems with positive minima of @xmath54 close to @xmath70 .",
    "these solutions decay with a velocity increasing with the value of this minimum .",
    "two bumps can unite if the interplay of diffusion and nonlinearity between them overcomes the decay when propagating from one layer to the next ; otherwise they remain disjoint . for a united bump",
    "the same scenarios exist , so a kind of association tree can appear in this way .",
    "qualitatively , all interesting results presented in this article do not require the existence of the correlation sensitive term ( @xmath118 ) and exist also in the system with static synapses , for which the correspondence to differential equations is known @xcite .",
    "for @xmath114 is rewritten as @xmath119 , describing the stable solution of a reaction - diffusion equation ( rde ) for one chemical with the reaction nonlinearity @xmath120 and diffusion coefficient @xmath121 .",
    "one can also interpret the layers in the network as different states of the system evolution in time on a discretized time grid .",
    "the corresponding time - continuous equation @xmath122 with redefined @xmath123 for the presence of a linear leak @xmath124 is analog to a rde for the time evolution of a system with one chemical .",
    "dissipative solitons are known to be solutions of such systems @xcite and correspond to the bump solutions .",
    "the interesting and non - trivial result is , that such solutions exist also for arbitrary learning rates @xmath118 and that their shape can be obtained analytically .    a more general equation @xmath125 of the same type as , but with an arbitrary number of functions under the second derivative is solved with the same substitutions @xmath126 : @xmath127 , @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "further simplifications done for were applicable only to this particular problem and are impossible in the general case .",
    "this generalized equation can be used to describe e.g. stable solutions for systems with several neuron and synapse types , in particular networks including inhibitory neurons . there",
    "the interaction between several bumps can exhibit more complex behavior than in the case of non - plastic synapses @xcite .",
    "this equation is similar but not equivalent to an equation describing a one - component reaction - diffusion system ( for only one @xmath130 this mapping is exact ) .",
    "still , a similar analysis of the existence of stable and meta - stable solutions , as presented for , is possible for this more general case .",
    "preliminary results indicate that associative learning and memory can persist even if the activity is restored to the baseline level , similar as in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical models of associative memory , such as fully connected hopfield networks and boltzmann machines @xcite , our formalism allows the study of spatially extended representations of earlier presented , learned objects .    with the leak term @xmath124 ,",
    "the evolution of activity is described by @xmath131 for stationary solutions @xmath132f(u(x))$ ] , which , after diffusion approximation of the sum , is equivalent to with parameters @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 instead of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath6 .",
