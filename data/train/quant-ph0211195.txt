    "we know that in the classical scattering of charged particles by magnetic fields the scattered particles describe circular trajectories with fixed radii , so they have a preferential direction of motion . in this work , the relativistic quantum version of the problem",
    "is studied in the lowest order of perturbation theory and a symmetric behavior in the scattering angle is found for uniform and solenoidal magnetic fields .",
    "we focus on the study of some interesting limit cases of the differential cross section and compare them with previous non relativistic results reported by aharonov and bohm ( ab )  @xcite and landau and lifshitz ( ll )  @xcite .    although the scattering of charged particles by a solenoidal magnetic field , aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect has been studied perturbatively before by other authors  @xcite , in this work we are interested in the classical limit of the differential cross section .",
    "as it is known , the ab effect  @xcite is considered one of the most important confirmed  @xcite predictions of the quantum mechanics because it shows that the vector potential has a physical significance and can be viewed more than a mathemathical convenience .",
    "the interest in this effect has been increased recently . both because of basic reasons that have changed the understanding of gauge fileds and forces in nature and also because it has a lot of connections with new physics , like the quantum hall effect  @xcite , mesoscopic physics  @xcite and physics of anyons  @xcite .    in the last two decades ,",
    "several treatments to the ab scattering problem have appeared .",
    "first , the magnetic phase factor in the non relativistic case was treated directly ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "works that consider spin have also been carried out and specially the behavior of the wave function is studied taking into account a delta function like potential at the origin  @xcite .",
    "although originally ab solved the problem exactly , the perturbative analysis has played an important role  @xcite , giving rise to discussions about the form in which the incident wave must be treated  @xcite .",
    "also , various qed processes of scalar and dirac particles in the ab potential have been carried out , and special interest has been devoted to polarization properties in bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "our interest in this problem stems from the fact that an electron in a uniform infinite magnetic field is trapped in two dimensions in a potential of the harmonic oscillator form .",
    "thus it is a confined point - like fermion and therefore resembles the dynamic confinement produced in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for quarks in three dimensions . in order to keep our analogy as close as possible to the parton model ideas",
    "our computation is done in a perturbative fashion . in this model ,",
    "the use of free particle asymptotic states is very common , nevertheless with a simple model calculation in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) we show that this procedure could be misleading at least in lowest order .    in this work we focus our analysis in the classical limit .",
    "first we are puzzled by the symmetric results of the differential cross section with respect to the scattering angle @xmath4 , in contradistinction to the classical scattering which favor an asymmetrical result .",
    "second , the classical limit of field theory is a long unsolved problem , it is therefore tempting to understand the above mentioned quantum ( symmetric ) vs classical ( asymmetric ) results in order to clarify the classical limit : are we in the presence of a process which is purely quantum in nature as ll suggest ?",
    "let us recall two landmark results of the non relativistic case for the differential cross section of the scattering of electrons by solenoidal magnetic fields .",
    "chronologically , the first result was presented by aharonov and bohm @xcite .",
    "they obtain the exact solution for the scattering problem when the radius of the solenoid is very small for a constant magnetic flux , in fact they consider only a quanta of magnetic flux ( @xmath5 gauss @xmath6 ) .",
    "their result is : @xmath7 independently , landau and lifshitz  @xcite study the same scattering problem with the use of the eikonal approximation . including only the contribution of the vector potential from the exterior of the solenoid , they obtain precisely the same as aharonov and bohm .",
    "notice that this cross section is symmetric in @xmath4 .",
    "landau and lifshitz compute the differential cross section for small scattering angles in the case of a small magnetic flux , @xmath8 , where perturbation theory is applicable , then @xmath9 , and the resulting cross section develops a singular behavior in @xmath2 : @xmath10 they comment that the singular behavior of the cross section in @xmath4 when it goes to zero is specifically a quantum effect , without any further comment .",
    "we will study this problem in the next sections .",
    "let us consider the scattering of a dirac particle by the magnetic field of a solenoid with a constant magnetic flux .",
    "this is a problem in which free particle asymptotic states can be used .",
    "the beam polarization will be taken into account . as mentioned before , this is a problem studied before by other authors also using perturbation theory , but here our interest is quite different .",
    "we want to study the classical limit of the result and discuss the proper way to get it .",
    "consider a long solenoid of lenght @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 centered in the @xmath13 axis .",
    "inside of the solenoid , where @xmath14 , the magnetic field is uniform , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being a constant , while outside the solenoid , where @xmath17 , the magnetic field is null . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath18 will be constant : @xmath19 .",
    "we will follow the bjorken and drell convention  @xcite .    a vector potential that describes such magnetic field for the interior of the solenoid is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "outside the solenoid , the vector potential is @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . using the levi - civita symbol in three indices , @xmath24 , the vector potential of the solenoid field",
    "can be written as @xmath25 with the scalar potential @xmath26 . replacing this vector potential in the @xmath27 matrix , equation  ( [ ec : sfi.prim.ord ] ) , for dirac particle solutions , equation  ( [ ec : psi.libre ] ) , and @xmath28 , we obtain @xmath29 \\bar{u}_f \\gamma^j u_i.\\ ] ]    notice that there exists a global phase @xmath30 in the free particle wave function because the presence of a pure gauge field in the exterior of the solenoid , but it does not contribute to @xmath31 . for both integrals the parts that correspond to @xmath32 and @xmath33 are proportional to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . so the energy - momentum conservation in the scattering process is guaranteed and the particles do not change their momentum in the magnetic field direction .",
    "the integrals in the plane perpendicular to @xmath36 are @xmath37 , \\nonumber",
    "\\\\     \\int_{r > r_0}{e^{-i{\\bf q\\cdot x}}\\frac{x_i}{x^2_1+x^2_2}d^2x}&= & -2\\pi i \\frac{q_i}{q^2 } j_0(q r_0 ) , \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the @xmath40 order bessel functions @xcite . in this form ,",
    "the @xmath27 matrix for @xmath28 is : @xmath41[2\\pi \\delta(q_3 ) ]                j_1(q r_0 ) \\epsilon_{ij3 } \\frac{q_i}{q^3 }                \\bar{u}_f \\gamma^j u_i.\\ ] ] we note that in the lowest order in the @xmath27 matrix there exists a net contribution from the interior of the solenoid , where the magnetic field is not null , in contradisctintion with the ll calculation , where only the vector potential of the exterior of the solenoid is considered .",
    "finally , the differential cross section per unit length of the solenoid is @xmath42    averaging over incident polarizations we obtain @xmath43 and we note that this result does not depend on the final polarization . after some algebra",
    "we get @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "finally , introducing @xmath2 and @xmath46 explicitly , we have @xmath47 which has the same form whether or not the final polarization of the beam is actually measured ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) . as can be observed , the differential cross section is symmetric in @xmath4 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the stern - gerlach result , in which an unpolarized beam interacting with an inhomogeneous magnetic field is equally split into two parts , each one with opposite spin .",
    "but , as we have mentioned before , equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) does not depend on the final polarization of the particles .",
    "thus , this symmetric behavior of @xmath4 should be a consequence of the perturbation theory but notice that it is also present in non perturbative results like those of ab and ll .",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] shows the behavior of the cross section of equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) in a polar plot scaled by a @xmath50 factor for a quanta of magnetic flux ( @xmath51 gauss @xmath6 ) , @xmath52 cm and the energy of the incident particles running from 1  mev to 50  mev in steps of 2mev as a function of the scattering angle @xmath4 .    when helicity states ( hs ) are considered , the resulting differential cross section is : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 stand for the initial and final states of helicity and acquire only the values @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "a zero differential cross section is obtained if @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath59 , which implies helicity conservation , then the differential crosss section is : @xmath60 which has the same form as equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) .",
    "to make connection with previous results , we study the limit case of small scattering angles . if we assume @xmath0 , then equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) ( or equation  ( [ dsigma_hs(i = f ) ] ) ) reduces to @xmath61 which agrees with the result reported by aharonov - bohm when @xmath62 . and",
    "if we impose in equation  ( [ secc.mm.r ] ) the condition @xmath1 we obtain @xmath63 which is presicely the result reported by landau and lifshitz .",
    "we want to point out that it does not make sense to take the planck s limit ( @xmath3 ) in equation  ( [ secc.mm.r ] ) or in equation  ( [ secc.mm.h.c ] ) , because both expressions were obtained assuming the condition @xmath64 .",
    "hence , we have to take the classical limit using the exprression for the differential cross section given in equations .",
    "( [ dsigma ] ) or ( [ dsigma_hs(i = f ) ] ) .",
    "let us study now the classical limit of the differential cross section of equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , consider the new adimensional variable @xmath65 and define @xmath66 or @xmath67  @xcite for fixed @xmath4 .",
    "we can rewrite equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) as follows : @xmath68 because the asymptotic behavior of the bessel function  @xcite is : @xmath69 the resulting planck s limit of equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) is identically zero for fixed @xmath70 and @xmath4 : @xmath71 which is also obtained for @xmath67 .",
    "so , the perturbative result gives a consistent finite classical limit and reduces to the eikonal and the zero radius limits . if the classical limit is attempted in equations .",
    "( [ secc.mm.r ] ) or ( [ secc.mm.h.c ] ) , the result would be singular in @xmath2 , but this is clearly a misleading procedure .    the apparent difference in the classical limits of equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) ( see equation  ( [ climit - dsigma ] ) ) and equations .",
    "( [ secc.mm.r ] ) and ( [ secc.mm.h.c ] ) comes from the fact that in taking the limit @xmath3 of the perturbative result , equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) , the bessel function decreses as @xmath72 and it does generate an @xmath2 contribution to the cross section . on the other hand , if one begins by taking @xmath73 , the bessel function approximates to @xmath74 , and this behaves like @xmath75 . the overall difference between these two procedures is an @xmath76 factor .",
    "it is important to notice that loop corrections to the perturbative expansion do not modify the @xmath2 behavior of the amplitude , this can be proved with the use of the loop expansion .",
    "one can obtain a non divergent expression for the landau - lifshitz and the aharonov - bohm results when @xmath3 if in place of @xmath77 one fixes @xmath18 , the magnetic flux .",
    "the rationale behind this is that instead of a classical limit , with fixed @xmath77 , one imposes the magnetic flux quantization condition , @xmath78 .    for a quantized magnetic flux , where @xmath79 gauss @xmath6 , the cross section of equation  ( [ dsigma ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath80 which apart of being independent of the charge of the particles , is a cross section of a purely quantum effect . cast in this way it is not singular in @xmath2 as in the form that landau - lifshitz report . in particular , for the case of small scattering angles , it takes the form @xmath81 which also has a null classical limit .",
    "if we recall equation  ( [ secc.dif.ll.singular ] ) obtained by landau - lifshitz , we see that the same form can be recovered when @xmath82 , but these authors did not quantize the magnetic flux and thus they can not get a cross section of a pure quantum problem as that of equation  ( [ dsigmamm.small_theta ] ) .    also note that the zero classical limit with quantized magnetic flux of equation  ( [ secc.dif.ab ] ) is obtained : @xmath83",
    "in this work we present a relativistic quantum study in first order of perturbation theory of the cross section of the scattering of a dirac particle with magnetic fields .",
    "we have specially focused in the classical limit for the solenoidal magnetic field case .    in order to fulfill",
    "the perturbation theory requirements the magnetic field was bounded to a solenoidal one with constant flux .",
    "we obtained that the cross section of the scattering problem is given by equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) and has the same form whether or not the final polarization of the beam is actually measured .",
    "this indicates that the symmetry in the scattering angle is most likely a consequence of the perturbation theory .",
    "we have shown that taking @xmath84 our result reduces to that one reported by aharonov - bohm .",
    "also , our result agrees with that one obtained by landau - lifshitz when we take @xmath73 and @xmath1 .",
    "notice that both cases lead to similar singular behavior in @xmath2 ( see equations .",
    "( [ secc.mm.r ] ) and ( [ secc.mm.h.c ] ) ) .",
    "we have shown that the perturbative classical limit for all scattering angles and all radii of the solenoid with @xmath85 and @xmath4 fix , is identically zero , because the cross section behaves like @xmath86 and hence it is not singular in @xmath2 as the one of landau - lifshitz ( see equation  ( [ secc.dif.ll.singular ] ) ) .",
    "we point out that the same zero classical limit can be obtained in the limit @xmath87 with fixed @xmath88 and @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the apparent difference in the classical limits comes from the fact that the asymptotic behavior of the bessel function goes like @xmath89 and it does generate an @xmath2 contribution to the cross section , while taking first the approximation @xmath73 , the bessel function behaves like @xmath90 .",
    "so , the overall difference between these two procedures is an @xmath76 factor .",
    "when the magnetic flux is quantized , the cross section is proportional to @xmath76 getting , again , a null classical limit .",
    "this limit can be recovered from the aharonov - bohm and landau - lifshitz results because @xmath91 and then @xmath92 an independent result of @xmath2 .    finally we want to point out that althought our reslut is consistent in the sense that the aharonov - bohm and the landau - lifshitz results are recovered , there is not a direct classical correspondence via the planck s limit ( see equation  ( [ climit - dsigma ] ) ) , because in particular the cross section is symmetric in @xmath4 .",
    "this problem is shared also by the ab and ll solutions and is possibly solved by higher order corrections in the _ external _ magnetic field .",
    "we want to thank the helpful comments of a.  rosado .",
    "this work was partially supported by conacyt  ( 3097p - e ) , dgapa - unam  ( in118600 ) and dgep - unam .",
    "[ campo.uniforme ]    here we consider the scattering of a dirac particle by an external uniform and constant magnetic field @xmath93 with @xmath16 a constant , described by the vector potential @xmath94 as in perturbative qcd we take initial and final states as asymptotic states of free particles with momentum @xmath95 and spin @xmath96 , explicitly : @xmath97 at first order in perturbation theory the scattering matrix @xmath31 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 the @xmath102 dirac matrices .",
    "if the initial state has momentum @xmath103 in the @xmath104 direction , the @xmath27 matrix for @xmath28 is @xmath105 where we have denoted @xmath106 and similarly for @xmath107 .",
    "the integrals can be solved immediately because three of them are proportional to a dirac delta function , while the integral in the @xmath108 direction is equal to @xmath109 .",
    "then , the @xmath27 matrix of this problem is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the momentum transfer .",
    "note that the resulting differential cross section is proportional to a dirac delta function of the momentum transfer in the incident direction of the particles , meaning that the particles do not change their momentum after their interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction with the common sense , because we know that in the classical situation a particle that interacts with a magnetic field changes its momentum , and its orbit is a circumference .",
    "also note that we assumed that the magnetic field fills all the space and we used free particle solutions to solve the scattering problem .",
    "these conditions are physically questionable because the presence of the magnetic field binds the particles and therefore the asymptotic sates can not be plane waves , just like is done in perturbative qcd .",
    "to use perturbation theory it is necessary to verify its applicability limits .",
    "for perturbation theory to be valid one must satisfy @xmath114  @xcite where @xmath115 is significant in the range @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the mass of the particle . for the case we are studying the range of",
    "the potential is infinite , so to use perturbation theory we need to modify the potential in such a way that it goes rapidly to zero at infinity , doing the system compatible with our calculation and with physics , and then the particles can be treated as free asymptotically .",
    "then , a more natural way to study the scattering of particles by an external magnetic field , is to confine the field in space , as was done in section  [ secc : rel - sol ] .",
    "curiously enought , we notice that the @xmath118 limit of equation  ( [ dsigma ] ) gives precisely the result of equation  ( [ secc.dif.campo.unif ] ) .",
