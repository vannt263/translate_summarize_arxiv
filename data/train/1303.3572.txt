    "a quantum ground state of a many - boson system can be in a spontaneously - symmetry - breaking state , or a topologically ordered ( to ) state.@xcite a to state is defined by the following features : ground state degeneracy in a topologically non - trivial closed manifold,@xcite or emergent fermionic / anyonic excitations,@xcite or chiral gapless edge excitations.@xcite if , in addition to a to , the ground state also has a symmetry , such a state will be referred as a `` symmetry - enriched topological ( set ) phase '' .",
    "recently , it was predicted that even if the bosonic ground state does not break any symmetry and has a trivial to , it can still be in a non - trivial phase called bosonic spt phase.@xcite since the bosonic spt phases have only trivial tos , a systematic description / construction of those spt phases were obtained via group cohomology theory.@xcite many new spt phases were predicted / constructed with all possible symmetries and in any dimensions , including three non - trivial bosonic spt phases with u(1 ) symmetry ( particle number conservation ) and time - reversal symmetry ( z@xmath0 ) in three dimensions .",
    "we will refer those phases as bosonic topological insulators ( bti ) .",
    "if a set state with the same symmetry as bti , we call it fractional bti ( _ _ f__bti ) . in the following",
    ", we also refer all gapped phases of bosons that do not break the symmetry ( including spt and set ) as `` _ _ topological phases _ _ '' .    to realize bosonic to phases or spt phases , the interaction is crucial , since without interaction , bosons always tend to condense trivially .",
    "this fact hinders the perturbation approach if we want to realize to or spt phases .",
    "one useful approach is via the exactly soluble models , as in the string - net approach@xcite and the group cohomology approach.@xcite recently , many other approaches were proposed , which are based on field theory , topological invariants , critical theory of surface , topological response theory etc.@xcite a quite effective approach for strongly interacting systems is the `` projective construction''.@xcite it has been recently realized that the projective construction is also helpful in constructing bosonic spt states.@xcite .    roughly speaking , in the projective construction , the bosonic operator is split into a product of parton operators .",
    "different kinds of partons can individually form different mean - field ground states .",
    "the physical ground state of the boson system is realized by projecting the direct product of multiple mean - field ground states into the physical hilbert space @xmath1 in which the multiple partons are glued together into a physical boson on each site . in terms of path",
    "integral formulation , such a gluing process is done by introducing fluctuating internal gauge fields that couple to partons .",
    "it is now well - known that three dimensional _ non - interacting fermionic _ topological insulators ( ti)@xcite are classified by z@xmath2 .",
    "the free fermionic ti state is protected by u(1)@xmath3z@xmath0 .",
    "the trivial and non - trivial ti phases can be labeled by the so - called `` axionic @xmath4 angle '' in the electromagnetic response action `` @xmath5 '' ( @xmath6 is external electromagnetic potential ) .",
    "@xmath7 corresponds to the trivial ( non - trivial ) phase .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there exists a bosonic version of ti , _",

    "ref . applied the fermionic projective construction approach in which the boson creation operator is split into a singlet pair of spin-1/2 fermions .",
    "it is assumed that the fermions are described by a non - trivial ti mean - field ansatz which explicitly breaks the internal su(2 ) gauge symmetry down to @xmath8 .",
    "the resultant physical ground state is a set state admitting a fractional @xmath4 angle and emergent z@xmath2 to . by definition , this bosonic insulator is a @xmath9bti , following ref . where a fermionic version in the presence of strong interactions is proposed .    in the present work",
    ", we shall consider u(1)@xmath3z@xmath0 symmetric topological phases of bosons in three dimensions .",
    "we will use a fermionic projective construction to construct symmetric gapless and gapped phases , the latter of which may have non - trivial to or spt orders .",
    "our boson model contains _ four _ kinds of charge-1 bosons with u(1)@xmath3z@xmath0 symmetry in three dimensions ( _ i.e. _ eq.([parton ] ) ) . in this fermionic projective construction ,",
    "each boson is split into two different fermions ( @xmath10 ) carrying `` spin-@xmath11 '' . @xmath12 and @xmath13 carry @xmath14 and @xmath15 electric charge , respectively ( see table [ chargetable ] ) .    to ensure that",
    "before projection the mean - field ansatz of fermions respects symmetry , we assume that mean - field ansatzes of the fermions describe fermionic gapped phase with @xmath16-angle @xmath17 for @xmath12 fermions and @xmath18 for @xmath13 fermions .",
    "we assume @xmath19 or @xmath20 where the two fermions form the same trivial band insulator state or the same topological insulator states .",
    "we will use @xmath21 to label those mean - field ansatzes .",
    "due to the projective construction , an internal u(1 ) gauge field @xmath22 exists which is gappless .",
    "so our construction ( at this first step ) leads to gapless insulating states of the bosons after the projection .",
    "we call such a state algebraic bosonic insulator .    to obtain gapped insulating states of the bosons",
    ", we shall push the internal gauge field into its confined phases , where quantum fluctuations are very strong which leads to a proliferation of certain dyon .",
    "there are many different kinds of confined phases that correspond to proliferation of different dyons",
    ". these dyons may carry many quantum numbers including : fermion numbers of @xmath10 , magnetic charge and gauge charge of the internal gauge field , magnetic charge and electric charge of external electromagnetic gauge field .",
    "we will use @xmath23 to label those different proliferated ( or condensed ) dyons that do not break the u(1 ) and time reversal symmetries .    after selecting a symmetric dyon condensate @xmath23 and charge assignment @xmath14",
    ", we may construct a gapped topological phases with u(1)@xmath3z@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we find that _ the dyon condensation break the `` gauge symmetry '' of shifing @xmath24 ( dubbed `` @xmath14-gauge symmetry '' ) , so that different @xmath24 will lead to different bosonic states up to a gauge redundancy _",

    "thus , those gapped topological phases are labeled by @xmath25 and @xmath23 ( see tables , [ tab : results0 ] , [ tab : results ] , and [ tab : results1 ] ) , and we have to choose certain special values of @xmath24 ensure the u(1 ) and time reversal symmetries ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_process ] ) .",
    "the excitation spectrum above those dyon condensates is formed by the so - called `` deconfined dyons '' that have trivial _ mutual statistics _ with the condensed dyon .",
    "the nature of topological phases in @xmath1 is determined by the properties of _ intrinsic excitations _ ( defined as those excitations that have zero magnetic charge of external electromagnetic field ) . a topological phase where intrinsic excitations carrying fractional electric charge , fermionic statistics , or , other forms of fractionalization is a set state ( _ i.e. _ @xmath9bti ) with both to and symmetry .",
    "if to is absent and symmetry is still unbroken , the topological phase must be a spt state .",
    "if the excitation spectrum of a spt state admits non - trivial witten effect with @xmath26@xcite , the state is a non - trivial spt ( _ i.e. _ a bti ) .",
    "otherwise , the state is a trivial spt , _",
    "i.e. _ a trivial mott insulator of bosons with symmetry .",
    "all topological phases that we constructed are summarized in table [ tab : results ] ( @xmath27 ) and table [ tab : results1 ] ( for a general @xmath14-sequence ) .",
    "these two tables contain the general results .",
    "for reader s convenience , some concrete examples of non - trivial bti phases are shown in table [ tab : results0 ] .",
    "the basic process of constructing symmetric topological phases is shown in fig .",

    ".assignment of em electric charge and @xmath22-gauge charge [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are condensed , the mutual statistics between them must be trivialized , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 which leads to @xmath31 we note that the u(1 ) symmetry of the original boson system is generated by conserved em electric charge rather than em magnetic charge .",
    "the em field here is non - dynamical so that the dyon condensates which form the physical ground state should have zero em magnetic charge .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath32 , and the above trivial mutual statistics condition becomes : @xmath33 to satisfy this condition , @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "but @xmath36 must be nonzero in order to preserve u(1 ) symmetry .",
