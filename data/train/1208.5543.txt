    "in recent years , there have been many algebraic constructions which in their background have some operadic origin .",
    "perhaps the most prominent are lie brackets , gerstenhaber brackets and master equations .",
    "the lie algebras of kontsevich @xcite as well as deligne s conjecture @xcite , its cyclic generalization @xcite and its @xmath0 version which was studied in @xcite , and notably string topology @xcite are of this type , especially when considered in the algebraic framework @xcite . among master equations the relevant constructions go back to sen and zwiebach @xcite and",
    "newer ones include @xcite .",
    "there is a plethora of further incidences which would fill volumes .",
    "one particularly important aspect for us is that solutions give rise to a viable action as explained in @xcite . without being too specific in this introduction",
    "there are several incarnations of the master equation going by various names : @xmath1 the first is a type of classical master equation , with the differential @xmath2 the equation is sometimes called maurer - cartan equation and with @xmath3 is called the quantum master equation .",
    "of course , one has to and we will specify where @xmath4 lies and what the definition of @xmath5 , @xmath3 is . as we expound , in an operadic type context , the algebraic operations as well as these equations both appear naturally .",
    "one key point of the paper is to establish that there is a universal framework of odd ( better @xmath6twisted ) structures , regardless of the details of the specific example which naturally explains all the constructions , including degrees and signs , in one fell swoop . within this general odd framework",
    ", there are spurious isomorphisms between twists that give rise to identifications with simpler constructions such as shifts and suspensions .",
    "this is for instance the case for operads and props , but not in general .",
    "moreover , instead of choosing a different twist for each example , we give a universal one to which all the different conventions are equivalent .",
    "the second point is to disentangle different structures that often appear in conjunction in specific examples .",
    "for instance , brackets on homomorphism spaces and brackets involving symplectic constructions , which _ inherit _ their structures from being _ examples _ of @xmath6twisted objects .",
    "furthermore , we show that to each framework there is a non  connected analog , which has an additional `` horizontal '' multiplication .    in a short form ,",
    "the mantra we provide for all these constructions is that    1 .   odd non  self  gluings give rise to odd lie brackets .",
    "odd self  gluings give rise to differential operators .",
    "3 .   the horizontal multiplication turns the odd brackets into odd poisson or gerstenhaber brackets and makes the differentials bv operators ( on the nose and not just up to homotopy ) .",
    "algebraically , the master equation classifies dg  algebras over the relevant dual or feynman transform .",
    "topologically , the master equation drives the compactification .",
    "the paper provides both an introduction to the theory and the classic context as well as gives new , state - of - the - art results in an accessible fashion and is intended for a general readership . to this end , we will go through the different cases by starting with the most familiar , operads , and make our way to less widely known subjects such as modular operads and @xmath6 twists through a progressive development .",
    "this yields a systematic study of the above mentioned algebraic operations , i.e.  brackets and bv operators @xmath3 , their occurrence in master equations , and the origin of these equations in the contexts of operads , cyclic operads , dioperads , ( wheeled ) prop(erad)s , ( wheeled ) props and modular operads as well as non  connected ( nc ) versions , nc(modular / cyclic / di ) operads , which we newly define in this paper .",
    "we define each notion from scratch and along the way treat the complicating issues of signs , the marked difference between the directed case , e.g.  operads and the non - directed case , e.g.  cyclic operads , and the difference between the symmetric and non  symmetric versions .",
    "we also show that in particular cases the odd structures can be shifted back to even ones , if there are spurious isomorphisms of twists as discussed above .",
    "finally , we firmly anchor our point of view in geometry . here",
    "we consider as a main source of examples operadic  type structure with compatible @xmath7 actions .",
    "this leads to one  parameter family gluings .",
    "on the chain level , these are naturally odd , since they have degree @xmath8 .",
    "this explains all the signs , as we have postulated .",
    "we also examine different geometrical origins such as framings in the so  called open case .",
    "we then argue that in these situations mantra ( 5 ) appears as the natural point of view .",
    "there is an extensive body of work in and around these subjects and we will clarify in the text which constructions are new , which ones are known or can be deduced from known ones , and which ones are related .",
    "we also refer to the section `` discussion and literature ''",
    "below for a more precise overview for the experts .    in @xcite , we give a general , abstract , categorical setup where all of the above types of `` operad  like '' structures are on equal footing as functors from so ",
    "called feynman categories .",
    "the selected ones are examples of feynman categories indexed over the feynman category of aggregates and graphs for which everything could be formulated .",
    "the odd versions of the structures are then obtained by using a universal twist called @xmath6 , which makes edges odd , viz .",
    "have degree @xmath8 . making the abstract concepts concrete in the examples most relevant for the `` practicing mathematician or physicist '' ,",
    "one is led back to the concrete constructions and calculations we present here . and",
    ", in fact , the theory of feynman categories was motivated by the calculations of this paper .    in the next two sections , we present the main results and the background discussion and literature for them .",
    "the reader not that familiar with the subject can skip these on a first reading , as they are more technical , and return to them after having been introduced to the notions by reading the main body of the paper .      combining our results with known constructions ( see discussion ) we arrive at the following theorems for the @xmath6twisted structures , see table [ oddtable ] .",
    "* theorem a. *    _ the odd algebraic structures arise naturally , _ without any extra _ ad hoc _ signs _ , on the coinvariants of the _ @xmath6twisted versions _ , which we define / recall .",
    "one obtains odd lie brackets from single edge odd non  self gluings and differentials @xmath3 from single edge odd self  gluings .",
    "_    in the directed case ( operads , prop(erad)s etc ) , the bracket is a commutator for a pre  lie or lie  admissible structure . in the non  directed case , ( cyclic , modular operad etc )",
    "there is only a lie structure .",
    "signs here are unfortunately a serious matter , which should not be underestimated and anyone involved in calculations knows about this .",
    "one of our key points is that the choice to work with the odd structures is the one that makes the signs natural in all contexts and hence gives a good solution for this problem . in the case of spurious isomorophisms of twists see table [ eventable] the bracket",
    "can be equivalently shifted to an even one using lemma [ shiftlem ] .",
    "one can ask whether or not these structures lift from the coinvariants . the answer depends on whether or not the relevant non  sigma ( planar ) versions exist and what symmetries they possess . for instance ,",
    "for odd operads , the lie structure on the coinvariants @xcite lifts to gerstenhaber s original bracket @xcite .",
    "analogously , we show in  2 , that the cyclic bracket , which we define in this paper , lifts to non  sigma cyclic coinvariants .    * theorem b. * _ in the non  connected case , the horizontal composition yields a multiplication , for which the bracket above becomes poisson and @xmath3 becomes a bv operator ( on the nose and not up to homotopy ) .",
    "_    we show that this type of multiplication can always be added by extending the operadic type structure to a non  connected ( nc ) version .",
    "this is one of the main new points of the paper .",
    "in particular , we apply this to the non  connected ( nc ) versions of operads , their cyclic and modular versions and dioperads  all hereto not formalized structures . for ( wheeled ) prop(erad)s the nc ",
    "stucture is simply given by ( wheeled ) props .",
    "* theorem c. * _ hom spaces between structures that differ by a @xmath6twist also carry the same algebraic structures appearing in the theorems a and b. _",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the way twists behave under tensoring .",
    "this covers as particular cases the examples of convolution operads / prop - erads after shifting and dualizing .",
    "dual transforms , which are analogs of the co  bar construction on the linear dual , give natural examples of the odd structures . by definition they are free @xmath6twisted objects on the linear dual together with a differential that is given by the dual of the odd self and non  self gluings , see  7 for details . indeed being odd is what makes the differential square to zero . these are quasi ",
    "free by definition , where quasi ",
    "free means dg ",
    "odd structures , that are free as odd structures , but not necessarily free as dg  odd structures . hence the algebras over them disregarding the dg ",
    "structures are simply given by invariant tensors .",
    "the sum / generating function of these tensors is @xmath4 , see  7 for details .",
    "* theorem d. *    _ an algebra over a dual transform is a dg ",
    "algebra if and only if the corresponding @xmath4 satisfies the master equation , where the terms in the master equation are in correspondence with the type of gluings / operations which appear in the definition of the differential .",
    "_    furthermore the algebraic operations appearing in the master equation are exactly those of theorems a and b.    nb : here one has to be careful which co  bar construction one chooses , or alternatively which operations one chooses to resolve .",
    "we only use only _ single edge gluings _ and we _ do not _ include the horizontal compositions in the resolution . the horizontal compositions are kept as a seperate multiplication .",
    "this is an important difference to the resolution of a prop as defined in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "physically the reason for this is that one wants to preserve the fact that the exponential of the action gives the sum over all non  connected graphs and hence the equivalence @xmath9 and its version without @xmath3 .",
    "this guarantees that we do not change the fundamental exponential / log relation between the generating functions for the connected graphs and the non  connected ones .",
    "as we present it , the last part becomes _ almost _ true by definition .",
    "there is one issue however , and that is to identify the two algebraic structures that appear .",
    "for instance in the directed case , one obtains , not an equation involving say the pre  lie product , but a lie bracket .",
    "this is due to the fact that the free construction involves taking coinvariants .    finally , we turn to the topological situation . taking the cue from @xcite",
    "we define @xmath7twisted versions of topological operads and arrive at    * theorem e. * _ the chains and homology of any @xmath7twisted @xmath10 of composition type are @xmath6twisted versions of that type . _ here being of composition type is a compatibility condition defined in  8 .",
    "this is the picture in the `` closed '' case : odd gluings arise from compatible @xmath7 actions . in the open case",
    ", they can also arise from framings ; @xcite and  8 .",
    "looking more carefully how an acceptable action @xmath4 can be built out of fundamental classes , one can say that by reverse engineering :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ topologically the master equation drives the compactification .",

    "_ _ _ _ _ _    the paradigmatic example is given by the real blowups of moduli spaces @xmath11 @xcite and the open / closed generalization of @xcite .",
    "this is treated in  8 , where also the @xmath12 operad and string topology are discussed .",
    "these considereations and our treatment of signs might be helpful for further endeavors in string topology , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the bracket and the signed bracket for operads are classical and go back to @xcite .",
    "the structure on the coinvariants is contained in @xcite . for operads",
    "the twist by @xmath6 is isomorphic to the operadic suspension followed by a nave one , see  4 . using this identification we compute that the signs and degrees hochschild cochains in appear naturally in our point of view .",
    "that is the hochschild degree and the odd operadic degree agree .",
    "furthermore the signed bracket and pre  lie structure of gerstenhaber becomes natural for the odd signed compositions that we introduce .",
    "the nc  version of operads is actually the most involved and there are several versions for it .",
    "one model is the prop generated by an operad , but there are others and we refer to  6 .    for the cyclic case , we show that there is a lie bracket on the coinvariants of an anti  cyclic operad , which in this generality is new .",
    "several examples of such lie structures have appeared in various guises in @xcite .",
    "many of these examples are given by anti ",
    "cyclic structures , that arise from tensoring particular cyclic operads with a particular anti ",
    "cyclic operad given by the endomorphism operad of symplectic vector spaces @xcite",
    ". this might lead one to conclude that these brackets are somehow linked to symplectic structures , while they truly only depend on the underlying operad being odd , see  2 .",
    "we make it clear that one only needs an anti  cyclic operad to get the bracket on coinvariants . in this generality ,",
    "the construction is new to our knowledge .",
    "we also clarify that the bracket lifts to the cyclic coinvariants and give the explicit relation to the non  cyclic bracket .    in the cyclic case ,",
    "the @xmath6 twist is again the operadic suspension followed by a nave suspension .",
    "the link is that unlike in the operadic case the operadic suspension of a cyclic operad is anti  cyclic .",
    "the additional shift then switches back and forth between the natural odd bracket on the @xmath6twisted / odd cyclic operads and the even bracket on anti  cyclic .    the nc ",
    "generalization is straightforward , but new .",
    "( wheeled ) prop(erad)s have been extensively considered in @xcite .",
    "there are several differences to the theory of @xcite though .",
    "the most important is that we only use only _ single edge gluings _ and we _ do not _ include the horizontal composition for both the brackets and differentials , as well as for the dual transform . in particular",
    ", this means that the bracket includes only the dioperadic gluings @xcite . modifying the computation of the lie property in the cyclic case",
    ", we conclude that the sum over the single edge gluings is lie  admissible . for propereads",
    "the @xmath6 twist is isomorphic to a semi ",
    "suspension on the out flags and the natural odd bracket appears as the shifted version .",
    "alternatively one can proceed as follows : for properads there is a lie ",
    "admissible algebra structure when using all 2-vertex multi  edge compositions @xcite . for props the product",
    "which is the sum over all 2vertex operations including the horizontal composition is even associative , @xcite .",
    "a short calculation then shows that the restriction to one edge gluings is still lie  admissible .",
    "the @xmath6twisted version is however different from the vertex suspension of @xcite .",
    "version for prop(erad)s are props . here in our point of view",
    "the horizontal composition is not on equal footing and should not be included in the bracket , but rather give a new multiplication .    for odd wheeled prop(erad)s and wheeled props",
    "we define the operator @xmath3 as the sum over all odd self  gluings . here",
    "the @xmath6 twist is as above and coincides with the shift considered in @xcite in the co  bar transform for the wheeled case up to isomorphism , see  4 .",
    "@xmath3 in the special case of a co  bar transform , or better dual transform , when considered as quasi ",
    "free , can also be recovered as the degree @xmath8 part of the @xmath13structure considered in @xcite , in the adaptation to the context of formal @xmath13manifold geometry for wheeled properads .",
    "the relevant theorem is theorem 4.1.2 . in @xcite .",
    "notice that in this setup there is no bv structure yet .",
    "for this one has to add the horizontal multiplication . that this works is explained through our framework ,",
    "see in particular theorem [ ncthm ] and figure [ bvcalcfig ] . in @xcite",
    "another special case of @xmath3 is given which classifies master functions from geometry , see proposition [ mmsprop ] . here",
    "the authors in our language consider a particular @xmath6 twisted wheeled properad which is the dual transform ( in our sense ) of a special wheeled properad .",
    "again , we show that the existence of @xmath3 and the bracket do not depend on having a dual transform or a quasi  free object and that the special case mentioned above is one instance of a general `` odd '' story .",
    "the nc  version are wheeled props and we keep @xmath6 as above .",
    "we then newly add the horizontal composition as a multiplication and get the new fact that @xmath3 becomes bv and the signed bracket odd poisson .    for modular operads",
    "the theory of twists was developed in @xcite and we transfer it to the other examples .",
    "this is straightforward in the algebra  over  a ",
    "triple formulation , see also @xcite for the anti  cyclic case and @xcite for examples in the directed cases . using this , we prove the isomorphisms stated above , see lemma [ twistisolem ] and table [ oddtable ] . for modular operads",
    "@xmath6 is the twist introduced in @xcite .",
    "we calculate that our natural odd bracket in this case is the underlying cyclic bracket and we add differential @xmath3 to this story . in @xcite , a bracket and differential was considered on the feynman transform which is @xmath6modular .",
    "again , we show that the existence of the algebraic structures only depends on having a @xmath6modular operad and not on having a ( quasi)free one .",
    "we also give a computation of the spurious isomorphisms of the twist @xmath6 ( see table [ oddtable ] ) and when one can shift back to an even situation ( see [ eventable ] ) .",
    "the nc  version for modular operads , see  [ ncmodularsec ] , is new .",
    "it is related to the mos of @xcite via taking coinvariants .",
    "this follows from theorems a and b. for the example of feynman transforms this theorem can be deduced from @xcite .",
    "the convolution operads and properads , @xcite are also examples .",
    "this is true because of the possibility to shift in the directed cases , as mentioned above , see table [ eventable ] .      for operads",
    "this is classical . for properads",
    "it can be deduced from @xcite by using e.g.  theorem 4.1.2 . in @xcite",
    "where now the quasi ",
    "free object is the dual transform involving only one  edge gluings . for props and properads",
    ", the equation follows in principle from the dioperadic structure @xcite .",
    "one has to careful though what structure one starts with and how the dual transform is defined and that the calculation is applicable . for @xmath6modular operads this result",
    "is contained in @xcite . for @xmath6twisted",
    "cyclic operads it then follows by restriction .",
    "the extension to the nc  case and the identification of the terms as gerstenhaber brackets and bv operators in general are new .",
    "a similar construction appears in @xcite and we thank a. schwarz for pointing this out to us .",
    "the application to the @xmath12 operad and hence string topology are new .",
    "the connection between compactifications and master equations has been studied in @xcite .",
    "another approach to these structures which we do not take in this paper is to use deformation theory . for the directed cases ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , one naturally has an @xmath13 sturcture on mapping spaces between quasi ",
    "free objects and dg  objects . in the particular case , where the quasi ",
    "free object is the dual transform and the dg ",
    "object has trivial differential , the @xmath13 structure reduces to a dg ",
    "lie algebra . here",
    "the degree @xmath14 part of the differential gives the lie bracket and the degree @xmath8 part ( if present ) an extra differential .",
    "notice that in the original approach there is no extra multiplication , since if present the horizontal composition is incorporated into the differential .",
    "one can , however , plug in our quasi ",
    "free dual construction ( wheeled ) di - operadic differential and get back our dg  lie algebra .",
    "then as we do one can _ add _ the horizontal multiplication to get a bv algebra .",
    "one interesting future mathematical aspect would be to use our appoach and the deformation approach for our dual construction simultaneously .",
    "a not directly related but interesting future question is the inclusion of homotopy bv algebras arising from having an internal multiplication as in the cyclic deligne conjecture @xcite , its @xmath0 versions @xcite or those from general deformation theory @xcite .",
    "if one does not resolve the property of being a differential , one might be able to use the homotopy bv model of cacti @xcite .    before embarking on homotopy considerations ,",
    "one first has to fix the model structure .",
    "this is done from the feynman categories point of view in @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank bill browder , maxim kontsevich , yuri i. manin , sergei merkulov , jim mcclure , albert schwarz , jim stasheff , dennis sullivan , bruno vallette and sasha voronov for enlightening discussions .",
    "we also benefited from the interest and discussions with clemens berger , dennis borisov , and benoit fresse .",
    "rk thankfully acknowledges support from nsf dms-0805881 and the humboldt foundation .",
    "he also thanks the institut des hautes etudes scientifiques , the max  planck ",
    "institute for mathematics in bonn and the institute for advanced study for their support and the university of hamburg for its hospitality .",
    "this project was worked on substantially while rk was visiting the ias . while at the ias rks work was supported by the nsf under agreement dms0635607 .",

    "any opinions , findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation .",
    "for convenience , we usually work in the in the category @xmath15 of graded vector spaces over a fixed ground field @xmath16 of characteristic @xmath17 . some constructions lie in @xmath18 .    for most constructions ,",
    "this is not necessary and one can generalize to any additive category ( or better a category enriched over graded abelian groups ) which is cocomplete . or even less , where the particular colimits we use exist .",
    "sometimes we however use the isomorphism between @xmath19 invariants and @xmath19 co  invariants for all @xmath20 . in this case , we need characteristic @xmath17 . usually this step is again convenient but not strictly necessary and it can be omitted at the price of less succinct statements .    we will also use the notion of disjoint union of sets . here",
    "one has to be a bit careful what one means . either the usual definition , which is neither symmetric nor associative , or its strictification . by this",
    "we mean the @xmath21 gives a symmetric monoidal structure on the category of finite sets with set maps and according to maclane s coherence theorem @xcite we can replace the category by a strict monoidal one .",
    "we usually choose the latter or alternatively , we implicitly assume the use of associators and commutators . apart from this remark",
    "we do not wish to burden the reader with these details .    finally to make the analogies more clear",
    ", we will use common notation for all the animals in the bestiary .",
    "that is @xmath10 will be an operad , cyclic operad , modular operad , prop , wheeled prop , properad , wheeled properad and their twisted versions .",
    "likewise we will use @xmath22 for triple again regardless of the specific details .",
    "this fits well with @xcite where @xmath10 is just a monoidal functor in each case and @xmath22 is the standard triple from a natural forgetful and the adjoint free functor .",
    "in this section , we start by collecting together the facts about operads and brackets . the main example is furnished by the hochschild complex and the gerstenhaber bracket . at the end , we take a slightly different point of view in accordance with our mantra by switching from operads to odd operads which we define .",
    "the benefit is that this gives agreement of the signs and grading from the operadic and the hochschild point of view .",
    "another thing which is special in the case of operads is that the bracket has a pre  lie structure .",
    "this traces back to the fact that for operads one is dealing with rooted trees .        for a finite dimensional vector space @xmath23 set @xmath24 .",
    "notice that these spaces are again vector spaces . another way to say",
    "this is that there is an internal hom in the category .",
    "these spaces have an obvious @xmath19 action by permuting the variables ( factors of @xmath23 ) of the multilinear functions .",
    "there are composition maps @xmath25 : @xmath26 which are given by substituting @xmath27 in the @xmath28th place of the function @xmath29 .",
    "there is a unit for these compositions which is the identity function @xmath30 .",
    "these compositions are associative and equivariant under the action of the relevant symmetric groups in a natural universal manner .",
    "that is for every pair of permutations @xmath31 there is a unique permutation @xmath32 s.t .",
    "@xmath33      we will briefly recall the salient features of the definition of an operad , which is an abstraction of the example above . a full definition can be found in @xcite .",
    "technically we will be dealing with pseudo operads , but with the exception of this subsection , we will not mention the `` pseudo '' any more .",
    "a unital ( pseudo ) operad is given by a collection @xmath34 in @xmath15 or more generally in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath35 together with :    1 .",
    "operadic compositions or gluing maps @xmath36 2 .   an @xmath19 action for each @xmath37 .",
    "3 .   and a unit @xmath38    such that the gluing maps satisfy the associativity relations @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the commutator map in the symmetric monoidal category . in the category @xmath15 @xmath40",
    "is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the degree .",
    "the unit satisfies @xmath43 and the gluing maps are required to be @xmath19 equivariant .",
    "we omit the rather lengthy formal definition of the equivariance in favor of the canonical example above from which it can be easily abstracted ; see also @xcite for a definition .",
    "the collections of @xmath19 modules @xmath37 is called an @xmath44module .",
    "the associativity means that any planar rooted tree @xmath45 with leaves labeled by @xmath46 determines a unique composition by using it as a flow chart . here",
    "associativity says that the order of the compositions is irrelevant .",
    "if we add the @xmath44 equivariance , then any rooted tree gives an operation .",
    "more in  [ triplepar ] .",
    "the operad @xmath47 plays a special role .",
    "an algebra @xmath23 over an operad is an operadic morphism from @xmath10 to @xmath47 ( of degree @xmath17 ) . here",
    "operadic morphism is the straightforward notion obtained by requiring that all the compositions and @xmath19 actions are respected .",
    "the operad @xmath47 can also be generalized to any closed symmetric monoidal category @xmath35 where now @xmath23 is an object .",
    "dropping the unit from the data and axioms yield the notion of a non  unital pseudo  operad . the distinction between pseudo or not is irrelevant in the unital case as these notions are equivalent ; see @xcite .",
    "dropping the @xmath19 action and the @xmath19 equivariance , we arrive at the definition of a _",
    "non@xmath48 _ operad .    given an operad @xmath49 we set @xmath50 .    if @xmath51 with ( internal ) degree @xmath52 , we set @xmath53 and @xmath54",

    "this induces a map @xmath59 which we denote by the same symbol .",
    "there is a natural lie bracket on @xmath60 @xcite and on its coinvariants @xcite @xmath61 .",
    "given an operad @xmath34 in @xmath15 .",
    "set @xmath62 then @xmath63 is a pre  lie multiplication and hence @xmath64:=a\\circ b - ( -1)^{deg(a)deg(b)}b\\circ a\\ ] ] defines a lie bracket on @xmath60 .",
    "this lie bracket descends to a lie bracket on @xmath61  for the grading @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore the pre  lie and lie structures already exist for non@xmath48 operads .",

    "the twist gluing and bv operator are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 operad contains the well known operad of framed little discs @xcite which is a cyclic @xmath7 operad .",

    "just like in the @xmath12 operad there is an action of @xmath7 on the inputs , as these are fixed to have arcs incident to them .",
    "thus we can twist glue by gluing in the @xmath7 families .",
    "given an @xmath7twisted @xmath10 of composition type , we can consider its @xmath7coinvariants .",

    "the second part is as above .",
    "the co  invariants of the sullivan prop are also what gives rise to an @xmath13 structure @xcite , which seems to be true in general .",
    "there are other early examples like the schwarz ",
    "modular operads mo @xcite where there are only self  gluings and a horizontal composition . in order to get an odd operation on the chain level schwarz",
    "considers so called emos ( extended modular operads ) , these carry just as above an @xmath7 action which gives an @xmath328 action on each @xmath329 .",
    "a particularly interesting type of situation occurs if one augments an operad with an @xmath7 action .",
    "the prototype for this is the collection @xmath330 of real blow ups of the deligne ",
    "mumford spaces along their compactification divisors as defined in @xcite .    here , before the blow  up , the spaces @xmath331 form a modular operad",
    " even the archetypical one .",
    "the gluing of two curves is given by identifying the marked points and producing a node .",
    "one feature of the compactification is that the compactification divisor is composed of operadic compositions .",
    "more precisely for each genus labeled graph @xmath137 of type @xmath332 there is a map @xmath333 where @xmath334 and in particular the one  edge trees define a normal crossing divisor .",
    "now after blowing up , the spaces @xmath335 do not form a modular operad anymore , since one has to specify a vector over the new node .",
    "this is the origin of the twist gluing",
    ". one could have also added tangent vectors at each marked point and the nodes .",
    "this would give a modular operad .",
    "construction is then just the twist gluing on the co  invariants .",
    "the master equation now plays the following role .",

    "one such framework is given in @xcite where geometric chains of joyce @xcite are used .",
    "the boundary in this case is essentially the geometric boundary of the fundamental class viewed as an orbifold with corners .",
    "notice that while in the dm setting the compactification was with a divisor i.e. of complex codimension one , after blowing up in the ksv setting the compactification is done by a real codimension one bordification .",
    "thus @xmath337 is the sum over these boundaries , which are exactly given by the blow ups of the divisors and these correspond exactly to the surfaces with one double point , either self glued or non  self glued . working this out one finds that @xmath4 satisfies the master equation .",
    "likewise there is a construction in the open / closed case in @xcite . here",
    "the relevant moduli spaces are the real blow ",
    "ups @xmath338 of the moduli space @xmath339 introduced in @xcite .",
    "these are the moduli spaces of genus @xmath27 curves with @xmath20 marked labeled points , @xmath207 boundary components and @xmath340 marked labeled points on the boundary . in the closed case",
    "the blow up inherits an orientation because before compactifying the moduli space has a natural complex structure . in the open / closed case one can define iteratively the orientation by lifting or pushing the natural orientation of @xmath341 ( see @xcite ) along fiber bundles that at the end reach any open / closed moduli space .",
    "whereas the degree @xmath8 in the closed case came from the fundamental class , here the grading comes from a grading by codimension in the corresponding moduli space .",
    "this agrees with the geometric dimension concept in the closed case .",
    "for instance , if a geometric chain has degree @xmath2 and it is constructed from @xmath342 , the real blow - up of the dm - compactification of the moduli space as in @xcite , we assign it a new degree : @xmath343 . in this new grading",
    "we also obtain a degree one map .",
    "indeed , if we have two chains of degrees @xmath344 and @xmath345 constructed from @xmath346 and @xmath347 respectively , their corresponding codimensions are @xmath348 and @xmath349 . after twist gluing",

    "something similar happens and the change in degree is 1 as well .",
    "this grading by codimension may seem odd but it is exactly what we need in the open case . recall that the twist gluing appeared in the closed case because of the different choices one has to attach surfaces along labeled points in the interior of the surface ( different angles ) .",

    "similar calculations take care of the self attaching operation and the second case .",
    "geometrically , the grading reflects the chosen orientations . and it is this choice of orientation @xcite that makes the gluing odd .    intuitively , in the closed case there is an extra vector being added in the tangent bundle due to the circle .",

    "this is taken a step further in @xcite where a product of cyclohedra and associahedra was given as the topological operad lying above the minimal operad of @xcite which in our framework is a feynman transform of the poisson operad @xmath369 .",
    "one question that remains is what is the general theory of a topological feynman transform .    for the closed type the set could be :",
    "@xmath370    this could be considered as a real blow up of the dm compactification .",
    "however , it is the way that this set is topologized which is not clear .",
    "furthermore there are the open examples , where the @xmath7 factors disappear in favor of more structure at the vertices . in all",
    "one could make the following tentative definition .    a topological feynman transform of a modular operad @xmath10 is a collection of spaces @xmath371 with @xmath372 such that there are fundamental classes coming from the relative fundamental classes which satisfy the quantum master equation .",
    "examples are then the moduli spaces above and the associahedra as well as the topological model for the minimal operad of kontsevich and soibelman @xcite .",
    "this is essentially equivalent to the cut  off view of sullivan @xcite . here",
    "the cut off is given by removing a tubular neighborhood of the compactification divisor which amounts to a real blow ",
    "up of that divisor .",
    "notice that in more involved cases , like the open / closed version , there might be several terms in the master equation .",
    "basically there is one term for each type of elementary operation .",
    "closed self , closed non ",
    "self , open self , open non ",
    "self  gluing and open / closed degeneration .",
    "this theme is explained in @xcite where we define a feynman transform relative to a set of generating morphisms .",
    "considering the master equations from the chain level , the master equation here could be interpreted as giving a morphism to the trivial modular operad .",
    "this of course can be viewed as pushing forward to a point , which is what integration is .",
    "an abstract graph @xmath137 is a quadruple @xmath373 @xmath374 of a finite set of vertices @xmath375 a finite set of half edges or flags @xmath376 and involution on flags @xmath377 and a map @xmath378 .",
    "we will omit the subscripts @xmath137 if no confusion arises .    since the map @xmath379 is an involution",
    ", it has orbits of order one or two .",
    "we will call the flags in an orbit of order one _ tails_. we will call an orbit of order two an _ edge_. the flags of an edge are its elements .      a graph with one vertex is called a corolla .",
    "such a graph only has tails and no edges .",
    "any set @xmath4 gives rise to a corolla .",
    "let @xmath380 be a one point set then the corolla is @xmath381 where @xmath236 is the constant map .    given a vertex @xmath382 of @xmath383 we set @xmath384 and call it _ the flags incident to @xmath382_. this set naturally gives rise to a corolla .",
    "the _ tails _ at @xmath382 is the subset of tails of @xmath385 .",
    "an orientation for a graph @xmath137 is a map @xmath388 such that the two flags of each edge are mapped to different values .",
    "this allows one to speak about the `` in '' and the `` out '' edges , flags or tails at a vertex .      as usual there are edge paths on a graph and the natural notion of an oriented edge path .",
    "an edge path is a ( oriented ) cycle if it starts and stops at the same vertex and all the edges are pairwise distinct . an oriented cycle with pairwise distinct vertices",
    "is sometimes called a wheel .",
    "a cycle of length one is a loop .",
    "a _ nave morphism _ of graphs @xmath389 is given by a pair of maps @xmath390 compatible with the maps @xmath28 and @xmath236 in the obvious fashion .",
    "this notion is good to define subgraphs and automorphism .",
    "it turns out that this data is not enough to capture all the needed aspects for composing along graphs .",
    "for instance it is not possible to contract edges with such a map or graft two flags into one edge .",
    "the basic operations of composition in an operad viewed in graphs is however exactly grafting two flags and then contracting .",
    "there is a more sophisticated version of maps given in @xcite which we will use in the sequel @xcite .",
    "for now we wish to add the following morphisms .",
    "_ grafting .",
    "_ given two graphs @xmath137 and @xmath391 , a tail @xmath104 of @xmath137 and a tail @xmath392 of @xmath391 then @xmath393 is the graph with the same vertices , flags , @xmath236 , but where @xmath394 , and the rest of @xmath28 is unchanged .",
    "the _ contraction of an edge @xmath239 _ of @xmath137 is the graph where the two flags of @xmath239 are omitted from the set of flags and the vertices of @xmath239 are identified .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath395 .",
    "_ given two graphs @xmath137 and @xmath391 merging the vertex @xmath382 of @xmath137 with the vertex @xmath396 of @xmath391 means that these two vertices are identified and the rest of the structures just descend .",
    "one thing that is not so obvious is how @xmath4labeling behave under these operations .",
    "if @xmath4 are arbitrary sets ( the unbiased case ) this is clear .",
    "if one uses enumerations however ( the biased case ) , one must specify how to re  enumerate .",
    "this is usually built into the definition of the composition type gadget .",
    "for the readers convenience , we list the definition of the algebras we talk about .",

    "<S> in this paper we show that gerstenhaber brackets , bv operators and related master equations arise in a very natural way , including signs and degrees , when considering odd or twisted versions of operads , cyclic or modular operads , ( wheeled ) prop(erad)s , and the other usual suspects .    </S>",
    "<S> the first point is that as soon as the underlying graphs of these structures are not directed or contain loops , it is essential to pass to the odd or twisted structures and the `` odd '' point of view provides a single all encompassing framework for all the examples . </S>",
    "<S> another key result is that in all cases there is a generalization to a non  connected ( nc ) version where disjoint union becomes a multiplication that turns the natural odd lie brackets into gerstenhaber brackets and the differentials into bv operators on the nose .    </S>",
    "<S> we give a systematic , comprehensive and unified treatment of all the usual setups above in a progressive fashion , by starting at the basic classical definitions and adding complexity guided by the examples . </S>",
    "<S> we both recover old results and obtain new ones , including brackets in the cyclic case and the above nc  generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach also allows us to disentangle structures that have sometimes been merged together in known examples .    </S>",
    "<S> algebraically , we describe the master equation as arising as an obstruction for algebras over the feynman or dual transforms to be dg  algebras . </S>",
    "<S> there is a categorical theory in the background , that of feynman categories @xcite , and this paper is a concrete realization of this theory for central examples .    geometrically , we anchor the theory by considering bv operators and brackets in string field theory / moduli space setting . </S>"
