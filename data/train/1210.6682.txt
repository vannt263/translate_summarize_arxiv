    "heavy quarks are expected to be a clean and penetrating probe to study the sqgp matter created in heavy ion collisions because of its intrinsic large mass property . by studying interactions between heavy quarks and medium",
    ", one can learn in detail the flavor dependence of parton energy loss mechanism , and also the medium s degree of thermalization by looking at the medium response to heavy quarks .",
    "precision measurements on heavy flavor hadrons in a wide kinematic region will be unique to understand these details .",
    "full reconstruction of charm hadrons has significant advantages over semi - leptonic decay leptons because of complete kinematics and clean interpretations .",
    "quarkonium suppression due to color screening has been originally proposed as a smoking gun for qgp formation .",
    "but various cold and hot medium effects complex this story and there hasnt been a direct evidence of color screening so far . bottomonium ( or @xmath0 ) production at rhic may offer us a unique opportunity to directly observe this signature because many cold and hot medium effects ( cold nuclear absorption , regeneration etc . ) are expected to negligible at rhic .",
    "while at lhc , these become complicated , particularly the regeneration process for bottomonium production can be significant , which introduces difficulties in the interpretation .",
    "in this proceedings , i would like to focus on latest rhic results on charm hadron and quarkonium ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the recent star measurements on the charm hadron production cross sections in @xmath2 and minimum bias au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "charm hadrons were reconstructed via hadronic decays .",
    "although it was not possible to reconstruct secondary decay vertices for charm hadrons in these measurements , star managed to overcome the large combinatorial background with large amount of statistics .",
    "the left plot shows the mid - rapidity production cross sections for @xmath3 and @xmath4 scaled to @xmath5 pairs vs. @xmath6 and the result is compared to a pqcd fonll calculation  @xcite .",
    "one can see over a wide @xmath6 region , the measurement is consistent with the upper bound of this fonll calculation .",
    "an interesting finding is that the charm hadron cross sections measured by cdf  @xcite and alice  @xcite at higher energies up to 7 tev are also closer to the upper limits of fonll calculations .",
    "similarly , the cross section of non - photonic electrons is also consistent with the upper bound of fonll calculations at @xmath7 1 gev/@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the star @xmath9 meson measurement covers about 70% of total @xmath6 acceptance , leading to a reasonable constrain to the total charm cross section .",
    "[ fig:1 ] right plot shows the total charm cross section per nucleon - nucleon collisions at mid - rapidity from @xmath2 to central au+au collisions .",
    "latest star au+au results were extracted from the @xmath3 spectrum measurements covering @xmath6 from 0.4 up to @xmath10 5 gev/@xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath5 cross sections were obtained assuming the @xmath11 fragmentation ratio still holds in au+au collisions which need to be tested in future measurements . the results exhibit an approximate @xmath12 scaling indicating charm quarks are predominantly produced from initial hard scatterings .",
    "the @xmath3 spectrum in au+au collisions can be compared to the reference @xmath2 data to calculate the nuclear modification factor @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] left panel shows the recent results from the star measurements .",
    "the @xmath13 covers @xmath6 up to @xmath10 5 gev/@xmath8 .",
    "although the values are consistent with unity given current uncertainties , there seems to be a hint of modification for @xmath3 production in this @xmath6 region .",
    "the blue dashed line depicts the @xmath13 calculated based on the blast - wave fit to the au+au spectrum .",
    "if one uses the blast - wave model with light hadron freeze - out parameters and calculates the @xmath13 , the result is shown as shaded area in the plot .",
    "the data points are significantly different from this predication indicating the charm hadrons freeze - out differently from the system compared to light hadrons .",
    "when going towards higher @xmath6 , the data points tends to show a slight suppression , however , the uncertainties are large .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] plots the @xmath3 @xmath13 from star together with the high @xmath6 measurement from central ( 0 - 20% ) pb+pb collisions by alice  @xcite .",
    "one should note the difference in the centrality for these two sets of data points . after considering this",
    ", there seems to be a consistent trend of @xmath3 @xmath13 between rhic and lhc although the uncertainties need to be shrink for detailed investigation .",
    "one should be aware that @xmath3 @xmath13 less than unity does nt necessarily mean the suppression of charm quark production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the sqgp medium in heavy ion collision may modify the distributions of charm quarks into different charm hadrons compared to @xmath2 collisions because hadronization scheme other than fragmentation ( e.g. coalescence ) can be significant as already been observed for light flavor hadrons .",
    "a complete understanding of charm quark energy loss requires measurements of all ground state charm hadrons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "@xmath1 production has been reported by the phenix collaboration , focusing on the low @xmath6 suppression observation  @xcite . with a couple of subsystem upgrades ,",
    "star has been able to measure @xmath1 production with improved statistics , particularly with significant capability covering high @xmath6 up to @xmath10 10 gev/@xmath8 .",
    "a combination of both phenix and star measurements covers significant large acceptance in 4@xmath14  @xcite , offering us a great opportunity to constrain the quarkonium production mechanism as well as to learn the cold and hot medium properties .",
    "most newly developed models can produce the cross section data points within accessible kinematic region .",
    "precision cross section measurements provide constrains on model calculations . in the meantime , more differential measurements ( e.g. polarization ) and/or with more extended kinematic coverage can allow us to disentangle different models and pin down the quarkonium production mechanism .    with significantly improved statistics at high @xmath6 ,",
    "rhic experiments are now able to study the @xmath6 dependent @xmath1 @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the @xmath1 @xmath13 results vs. centrality ( left ) and @xmath6 ( right ) . on the left plot ,",
    "the latest star au+au results were divided into two @xmath6 bins .",
    "the low @xmath6 ( 2 - 5 gev/@xmath8 ) data show consistency with the phenix published data points",
    ". high @xmath6 ( @xmath15 5 gev/@xmath8 ) data show systematically higher @xmath13 compared to low @xmath6 . in peripheral au+au collisions ,",
    "the high @xmath6 data are consistent with no suppression , while in central collisions , @xmath1 s are still significantly suppressed , which may be due to the color - screening effect . on the right , the @xmath13 values are plotted vs. @xmath6 for two centrality bins and one can see the @xmath6 dependent structure more clearly",
    ". also plotted on these two plots are theoretical model calculations which both include the @xmath1 dissociation in the qgp phase as well as the regeneration process  @xcite .",
    "both model calculations generally describe the data well .",
    "the system size and @xmath6 dependence of @xmath1 @xmath13 can be attributed to the formation time and/or leakage effects .",
    "there have been many interesting results from lhc experiments recently .",
    "atlas and cms also observed large suppression of high @xmath6 @xmath1 in central pb+pb collisions  @xcite , and the suppression seems to be stronger than that of rhic high @xmath6 @xmath1 s , consistent with more suppression in a larger size system .",
    "alice reported low @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath13 at forward rapidity  @xcite .",
    "comparing to the phenix result , the higher @xmath13 values observed is consistent with more regeneration at lhc than at rhic .",
    "although current observations seem to qualitatively agree with expectations , but quantitatively , we need further systematic studies on both rhic and lhc to understand the quarkonium production mechanism as well as the medium properties .",
    "this also requires precision measurements in @xmath16+a collisions to control the shadowing and the cold nuclear absorption effects .",
    "another striking result reported by star is the @xmath1 elliptic flow ( @xmath17 ) measurement  @xcite .",
    "it has a significant improvement in term of precision compared the previous phenix measurement  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the @xmath1 @xmath17 results from both phenix and star in 20 - 60% au+au collisions and they are compared to various model predictions .",
    "data show at @xmath18 2 gev/@xmath8 , there is no sizable @xmath17 for @xmath1 , which disfavors coalescence production from thermalized charm quarks .",
    "one should note the valid centrality and @xmath6 regions for this statement .",
    "based on model calculations  @xcite which generally reproduce the @xmath1 @xmath13 and @xmath17 , the coalescence contribution in 20 - 60% au+au collision at rhic is not dominant , and it mostly contributes in low @xmath6 ( @xmath19 3 gev/@xmath8 ) region .",
    "high @xmath6 region is still dominated by the initial @xmath1 production plus possible dissociation in the medium .",
    "to get insight of the clean charm quark @xmath17 from the measurement of @xmath1 at rhic energy , one need to focus on the @xmath6 region below @xmath10 3 gev/@xmath8 and central collisions .",
    "this requires further improvement in the experimental precision .",
    "another alternate way to learn the charm quark @xmath17 will be to measure the charm hadron @xmath17 as experimentally , and it will be achievable with great precision with help of the future silicon vertex detector .",
    "study of bottomonium production at rhic is a unique way to get insight of the originally proposed qgp color screen signature .",
    "the challenge for rhic experiments is the statistics which makes this measurement likely to be a multi - year program .",
    "both phenix and star have reported @xmath0 ( 1s+2s+3s states if not specified ) signals from @xmath2 and au+au collisions since qm2009 .",
    "the star published and phenix preliminary @xmath0 cross sections in @xmath2 collisions are consistent with pqcd model calculations and lie on the trend of energy dependence curve  @xcite .",
    "recently , with significantly improved statistics in au+au collisions , star was able to measure the centrality dependence of @xmath0 @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the @xmath0 @xmath13 vs. centrality .",
    "it shows a trend of @xmath0 suppression in central au+au collisions .",
    "taking into account all current uncertainties from au+au and @xmath2 reference , the measured value is @xmath10 3@xmath20 below unity .",
    "the red dotted line depicts a naive expectation assuming 2s and 3s states completely melt based on pqcd cross sections and pdg branching ratios .",
    "the blue dashed line depicts the expect value when all excited bottomonium states ( including @xmath21 ) all melt and only @xmath0(1s ) survies  @xcite .",
    "the data now seem to favor the scenario that only @xmath0(1s ) survies , but to learn quantitatively suppression levels of different bottomonium states requires significantly improved statistics in the future .    with great mass resolution ,",
    "cms collaboration was managed to separate ( 2s+3s ) states from 1s state and they reported the separate @xmath13 values in minbias pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev  @xcite . when combining them together to compare with rhic results , the expected",
    "@xmath13 for central collisions should be less than 0.42 , which is generally in line with the star result .",
    "however , one should note that the cold and hot medium effects may be significantly different between rhic and lhc .",
    "in a short summary , rhic heavy flavor program has achieved many significant results particularly in the past couple of years .",
    "it will remain as one of the focuses of rhic heavy ion program in the upcoming rhic ii era .",
    "both phenix and star are building significant detector subsystem upgrades now or in the coming years , e.g. phenix vtx and fvtx , star hft and mtd upgrades etc .",
    "these are all aiming for precision measurements of both open heavy flavor and quarkonium production at rhic ii . with the lhc experiments ongoing",
    ", rhic heavy flavor program will be complementary and remain competitive in many aspects",
    ". some of the measurements will be unique at rhic , including : a ) high precision open charm hadron measurements at low @xmath6 to address charm - medium interactions , b ) bottomonium production measurements as bottomonia are expected to be clean at rhic because of negligible contribution from regeneration , c ) heavy quark correlation measurements as heavy quarks are expected to be back - to - back correlated in @xmath2 collisions which allows clean interpretations for results in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these systematic study of heavy flavor measurements at rhic and lhc will significantly improve our understanding of the sqgp matter by quantifying its physical properties with controlled accuracy ."
