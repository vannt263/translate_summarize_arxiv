    "it has been recognized for some time that the @xmath0 suppression rate vs. residual resistivity for zn is smaller than predicted by ag theory for pointlike scatterers in a @xmath1-wave superconductor@xcite by about a factor of three in optimally doped ybco , and even smaller in other materials like lsco .",
    "we have now argued that the `` conventional '' explanation , based on highly anisotropic scattering by zn impurities , is unlikely to be correct .",
    "it seems , therefore , that even in the optimally doped cuprates the deviation must be ascribed to effects of strong correlations or strong coupling superconductivity . within eliashberg",
    "theory,@xcite the ag pair - breaking parameter is renormalized @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the dimensionless coupling , while the disorder - induced resistivity change is unrenormalized to leading order .",
    "the physical origin of this effect is not clear in the cuprate context , however , kulic and oudovenko@xcite argue that renormalizations of the scattering vertex due to strong interactions within the t -j model introduce significant suppression of the transport rate induced by impurities .",
    "while this can not explain the effects of forward potential scattering for out of plane scatterers as discussed here , since the renormalization in their model is independent of the anisotropy of the scattering , it may be part of the solution to the zn problem .",
    "another perspective on the same physics to explain this effect may involve the low - energy spin fluctuations known to be induced by disorder in strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "no theoretical work which considers both @xmath0 and residual @xmath14 is available at this writing , however ; it is difficult to predict _ a priori _ which quantity will be more strongly influenced by correlations .",
    "we summarize the situation comparing the current theory to experiments in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment_compare ] .",
    "since we are primarily interested in order - of - magnitude physics , we discuss only the initial slopes of @xmath0 suppression measured in various experiments , and compare to the toy model result eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcsupp ] ) . to obtain a fit one must make an assumption about the parameter @xmath84 which enters this expression .",
    "a reasonable choice for the high-@xmath0 materials is @xmath85 , and this choice puts most of the data on zn - ybco about a factor of 3 higher in slope , as found by previous authors . the range of @xmath0 suppression initial slopes within the current approach is then shown in the figure in gray , ranging from the isotropic result to the extreme forward scattering result . for comparison , a set of curves",
    "is also given for the unphysical case @xmath86 .",
    "while these parameters should not be taken too seriously in a quantitative sense , it seems clear that a ) a hitherto unaccounted for physical mechanism is required to explain the data on zn - substituted samples ; and b ) the effect of out - of - plane scatterers within the present model can only account for a factor of 4 or so increase in the magnitude of the slope .",
    "thus our work has explained qualitatively the paradoxical result that the out of plane scatterers generically reduce @xmath0 more quickly than in - plane relative to residual resistivity , there is still a quantitative question remaining regarding the magnitude of the suppression in both cases .",
    "the final experimental result we have attempted to discuss is the fascinating linear @xmath0 vs @xmath14 suppression measured on electron - irradiated single crystals of optimally doped ybco by rullier - albenque et al@xcite .",
    "the deviation from the ag pairbreaking result was attributed by these authors to phase fluctuations according to a model put forward in ref . .",
    "this is plausible for the underdoped sample where phase fluctuations are expected to be strong , and for the highly irradiated optimally doped sample , where the superfluid density is also small .",
    "we note , however , that within this scenario it is puzzling and must be regarded as accidental that the initial @xmath0 slope in the optimally doped sample , due to pairbreaking , is the same as the final slope before superconductivity disappears .",
    "it is therefore equally likely , in our opinion , that the quasilinearity found by these authors is due to the effects of out - of - plane defects created by the electron irradiation , as discussed here , and/or the effects of order parameter suppression as discussed in ref . .",
