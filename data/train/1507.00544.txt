    "in ref .  @xcite , section 2.4(impossibility of superposing states belonging to different coherent sectors ) , the authors construct a proof using a superoperator g that commutes with all observables of the system .",
    "the eigenstates of operator g are of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are labels to distinguish different eigenvectors all of which are non - degenerate , i.e. @xmath3 if @xmath4 . + in the next section(2.4 ) , they construct a vector @xmath5 = @xmath6 superposing the eigenstates of g and claim that since g commutes with every other observable , @xmath5 should be an eigenstate of every operator in a complete set of commuting observables of the system .",
    "+ now we know that if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are eigenvectors of an operator g , then @xmath9 is not an eigenvector unless they have the same eigenvalue since : @xmath10 ( for some @xmath11 ) unless a = b , which is not true in general and definitely not true for the hermitian operators with non - degenerate eigenvalues in the paper .",
    "it is true that if g commutes with every other observable and has non - degenerate eigenvalues , then all such obervables share the same eigenvectors .",
    "but @xmath5 itself is not an eigenvector of g as proved above . and",
    "so @xmath5 can not be an eigenvector of other observables too .",
    "to summarize , the proof of superselection rules proposed is thus is not valid for the case discussed by the authors . whether a similar proof can be constructed is still open .",
