    "to perform precise standard model measurements or search for new physics phenomena at hadron colliders , it is essential to have a good understanding not only of the short - distance `` hard '' scattering process , but also of the accompanying interactions of the rest of the proton  collectively termed the `` underlying event '' ( ue ) .",
    "it is impossible to uniquely separate the ue from the hard scattering process on an event - by - event basis .",
    "however , observables can be measured which are sensitive to its properties .",
    "the ue may involve contributions from both hard and soft physics , where `` soft '' refers to interactions with low transfer between the scattering particles .",
    "soft interactions can not reliably be calculated with perturbative qcd methods , and are generally described in the context of different phenomenological models , usually implemented in monte carlo ( mc ) event generators .",
    "these models contain many parameters whose values are not _ a priori _ known .",
    "therefore , to obtain insight into the nature of soft qcd processes and to optimize the description of ue contributions for studies of hard - process physics such as hadronic jet observables , the model parameters must be fitted to experimental data .",
    "measurements of primary charged particle multiplicities have been performed in `` minimum bias '' ( mb ) events at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "such inclusive studies provide important constraints on soft hadron - interaction models .",
    "however , observables constructed for the study of the ue measure the structure of hadronic events in a different way , focusing on the correlation of soft - process features to one another and to those of the hardest processes in the event .",
    "ue observables have been measured in @xmath0 collisions in dijet and drell - yan events at cdf in run  i  @xcite and run  ii  @xcite at center - of - mass energies of @xmath1 and respectively , and in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 in a detector - specific study by cms  @xcite",

    "the ue observables are constructed from primary charged particles in the pseudorapidity range @xmath4 , whose transverse momentum component - axis , while the positive @xmath5-axis is defined as pointing from the collision point to the center of the lhc ring and the positive @xmath6-axis points upwards .",

    "primary charged particles are defined as those with a mean proper lifetime @xmath13 , either directly produced in @xmath2 interactions or in the decay of particles with a shorter lifetime . at the detector level , charged particles are observed as tracks in the inner tracking system .",
    "the direction of the track with the largest in the event  referred to as the `` leading '' track  is used to define regions of the @xmath14@xmath7 plane which have different sensitivities to the ue .",
    "the axis given by the leading track is well - defined for all events , and is highly correlated with the axis of the hard scattering in high - events .",
    "a single track is used as opposed to a jet or the decay products of a massive gauge boson , as it allows significant results to be derived with limited luminosity and avoids the systematic measurement complexities of alignment with more complex objects .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ueregions ] , the azimuthal angular difference between charged tracks and the leading track , @xmath15 , is used to define the following three azimuthal regions  @xcite :    * @xmath16 , the `` toward region '' ; * @xmath17 , the `` transverse region '' ; and * @xmath18 , the `` away region '' .",
    "the transverse regions are most sensitive to the underlying event , since they are generally perpendicular to the axis of hardest scattering and hence have the lowest level of activity from this source . however",
    ", the hard scatter can of course also emit particles perpendicular to the event axis : the regional division is not , and can not be , an exact filter .",
    "the observables examined in this analysis are described in table  [ tab : obs ] .",

    "the atlas detector  @xcite covers almost the whole solid angle around the collision point with layers of tracking detectors , calorimeters and muon chambers .",
    "it has been designed to study a wide range of physics topics at lhc energies . for the measurements presented in this paper , the trigger system and the tracking devices were of particular importance .",
    "the atlas inner detector has full coverage in @xmath7 and covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath22 .",
    "it consists of a silicon pixel detector ( pixel ) , a silicon strip detector namely the semiconductor tracker ( sct ) and a straw - tube transition radiation tracker ( trt ) .",
    "these detectors cover a radial distance from the interaction point of 50.5 , 299 and 563 , respectively , and are immersed in a 2  tesla axial magnetic field .",
    "the inner detector barrel ( end - cap ) parts consist of 3 ( @xmath23 ) pixel layers , 4 ( @xmath24 ) layers of double - sided silicon strip modules , and 73 ( @xmath25 ) layers of trt straw - tubes .",
    "these detectors have position resolutions of typically 10 , 17 and for the @xmath26@xmath7 coordinate and ( for the pixel and sct ) 115 and for the @xmath26@xmath9 coordinate . a track traversing the barrel",
    "would typically have 11 silicon hits ( 3 pixel clusters , and 8 strip clusters ) , and more than 30 straw - tube hits .",
    "the atlas detector has a three - level trigger system :  level  1  ( l1 ) , level  2 ( l2 ) and the event  filter  ( ef ) . for this measurement ,",
    "the trigger relies on the beam pickup timing devices ( bptx ) and the minimum bias trigger scintillators ( mbts ) .",
    "the bptx are composed of electrostatic beam pick - ups attached to the beam pipe at a distance @xmath27 from the center of the atlas detector .",
    "the mbts are mounted at each end of the detector in front of the liquid - argon endcap - calorimeter cryostats at @xmath28 and are segmented into eight sectors in azimuth and two rings in pseudorapidity ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "data were taken for this analysis using the single - arm mbts trigger , formed from bptx and mbts trigger signals .",
    "the mbts trigger was configured to require one hit above threshold from either side of the detector .",
    "the mbts trigger efficiency was studied with a separate pre - scaled l1 bptx trigger , filtered to obtain inelastic interactions by inner detector requirements at l2 and ef .",
    "in scattering processes modeled by lowest - order perturbative qcd two - to - two parton scatters , at sufficiently low the partonic jet cross - section exceeds that of the total hadronic cross - section . this problem is resolved by allowing the possibility of multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) in a given hadron - hadron interaction . in this picture , the ratio of the partonic jet cross - section to the total cross - section is interpreted as the mean number of parton interactions in such events .",
    "this idea is implemented in several monte carlo event generators , and is usually complemented by phenomenological models which continue to be developed .",
    "these include ( non - exhaustively ) further low screening of the partonic differential cross - section , use of phenomenological transverse hadronic - matter distributions , reconfiguration of color string or cluster topologies , saturation of parton densities at low-@xmath5 , and connection to elastic scattering and cut - pomeron models via the optical theorem .",
    "such models typically contain several parameters , which may be tuned to data at different center - of - mass energies and in various hadronic processes .",
    "mc tuning has been actively pursued in recent years , and standard tunes are being iterated in response to early lhc data , including those presented in ref .",

    "atlas  mc09 is the reference pythiatune throughout this paper , and samples generated with this tune were used to calculate detector acceptances and efficiencies to correct the data for detector effects .",

    "particular attention was devoted to the description in the simulation of the size and position of the collision beam - spot and of the detailed detector conditions during the data - taking runs .    for the purpose of comparing the present measurement to different phenomenological models , several additional mc samples were generated .",

    "all data used in this paper were taken during the lhc running periods with stable beams and defined beam - spot values , between 6th15th  december  2009 for the analysis at @xmath31 , and from 30th  march to 27th  april  2010 for the analysis .",
    "the only operational requirement was that the mbts trigger and all inner detector subsystems were at nominal conditions . during the december data taking period ,",
    "more than 96% of the pixel detector , more than 99% of the sct and more than 98% of the trt was operational .",
    "these efficiencies were higher in 2010 .    to reduce the contribution from backgrounds and secondaries , as well as to minimize the systematic uncertainties , the following criteria were imposed :    * the presence of a reconstructed primary vertex using at least two tracks , each with : * * @xmath32 ; * * offline reconstruction within the inner detector , @xmath4 ; * * a transverse distance of closest approach with respect to the beam - spot ( bs ) position , @xmath33 , of less than ; * * uncertainties on the transverse and longitudinal distances of closest approach of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; * * at least one pixel hit , at least four sct hits and at least six silicon hits in total . + beam - spot information was used both in the track pre - selection and to constrain the fit during iterative vertex reconstruction , and vertices incompatible with the beam - spot were removed .",
    "the vertices were ordered by the @xmath36 over the tracks assigned to the vertex , which is strongly correlated with the total number of associated tracks , with the highest-@xmath36 vertex defined as the primary interaction vertex of the event .",
    "+ events that had a second primary vertex with more than three tracks in the same bunch crossing were rejected . if the second vertex had three or fewer tracks , all tracks from the event that passed the selection",
    "were kept .",
    "after this cut , the fraction of events with more than one interaction in the same bunch crossing ( referred to as pile - up ) was found to be about @xmath37 ; the residual effect was thus neglected . at @xmath31 , since the data were taken at the low luminosity period , the rate of pileup was even lower and was also neglected .",
    "* at least one track with : * * @xmath38 , * * a minimum of one pixel and six sct hits ; * * a hit in the innermost pixel layer ( the b - layer ) , if the corresponding pixel module was active ; * * transverse and weighted - longitudinal impact parameters with respect to the event - by - event primary vertex were required to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; compensates for the @xmath41 in the denominator of the uncertainty of @xmath42 derived from the measured distance of closest approach .",
    "] * * for tracks with @xmath43 , a @xmath44 probability of track fit @xmath45 was required in order to remove mismeasured tracks .",
    "only events with leading track @xmath46 were considered , in order to reject events where the leading track selection can potentially introduce large systematic effects .",
    "this also has the effect of further reducing the contribution from diffractive scattering processes .",
    "two separate analyses were performed , in which all the other tracks were required to have either @xmath32 or @xmath12 . for @xmath47 tracks ,",
    "the silicon and impact parameter requirements were the same as given earlier for tracks with @xmath38 . for tracks with the lower threshold ,",
    "all other selection criteria were the same except that only two , four or six sct hits were required for tracks with @xmath48 @xmath49 , , respectively .",
    "tracks with @xmath12 are less prone than lower - tracks to inefficiencies and systematic uncertainties resulting from interactions with the material inside the tracking volume . whenever possible , the tracks were extrapolated to include hits in the trt .",
    "typically , 88% of tracks inside the trt acceptance ( @xmath50 ) included a trt extension , which significantly improves the momentum resolution .",
    "after these selections , for the ( ) analysis , 189,164 and 6,927,129 events remained at and respectively , containing 1,478,900 ( 4,527,710 ) and 89,868,306 ( 209,118,594 ) selected tracks and corresponding to integrated luminosities of and , respectively . for the mc models considered here , the contribution of diffractive events to the underlying event observables was less than  @xmath51",
    "the amount of beam and non - beam ( cosmic rays and detector noise ) background remaining after the full event selection was estimated using the number of pixel hits which were not associated to a reconstructed track .",
    "this multiplicity included unassigned hits from low - looping tracks , but was dominated at higher multiplicities by hits from charged particles produced in beam background interactions .",
    "the vertex requirement removed most of the beam background events and the residual contribution from beam background events after this requirement was below  0.1% .",
    "as the level of background was found to be very low , no explicit background subtraction was performed .",
    "the primary charged - particle multiplicities were measured from selected tracks after correcting for the fractions of secondary and poorly reconstructed tracks in the sample . the potential background from fake tracks was found via mc studies to be less than 0.01% .",
    "non - primary tracks predominantly arise from hadronic interactions , photon conversions to positron - electron pairs , and decays of long - lived particles . for above the contribution from photon conversions is small , and side - band regions of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters from data were used to find a scaling factor of 1.3 for the track yield in mc to get a better agreement with the data .",
    "this is not the case at lower .",
    "a separate fit to the tails of the @xmath52 distribution for primaries , non - primaries from electrons and other non - primaries , was carried out in eight bins of in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the scaled mc was then used to estimate the fraction of secondaries as a function of both and  in the selected track sample , which is found to be at most 2% for events in both and collisions  @xcite . the systematic uncertainty on the secondaries is included in the uncertainties due to tracking .",
    "the data were corrected back to charged primary particle spectra satisfying the event - level requirement of at least one primary charged particle within @xmath46 and @xmath4 .",
    "a two step correction process was used , where first the event and track efficiency corrections were applied , then an additional bin - by - bin unfolding was performed to account for possible bin migrations and any remaining detector effects .",
    "trigger and vertexing efficiencies were measured  @xcite as a function of the number of tracks , @xmath54 , passing all the track selection requirements except for the primary vertex constraint . in this case the transverse impact parameter with respect to the beam - spot  @xcite was required to be less than .",
    "the event level corrections consisted of the following :    * the efficiency of the mbts scintillator trigger , @xmath55 was determined from data using an orthogonal trigger .",
    "it consisted of a random trigger , requiring only that the event coincided with colliding bunches and had at least 4 pixel clusters and at least 4 sct space points at l2 .",
    "the trigger was found to be @xmath56 efficient for low - multiplicity events , and almost fully efficient otherwise .",
    "it showed no dependence on the and pseudorapidity distributions of the selected tracks . * the vertex reconstruction efficiency , @xmath57 was also measured in data , by taking the ratio of the number of triggered events with a reconstructed vertex to the total number of triggered events . for events containing fewer than three selected tracks ,",
    "the efficiency was found to depend on the projected separation along the beam axis of the two extrapolated tracks , @xmath58 .",
    "this efficiency amounted to approximately 90% for the lowest bin of @xmath54 , rapidly rising to 100% . * a correction factor , @xmath59 accounts for the probability that due to the tracking inefficiency none of the candidate leading tracks with @xmath38 are reconstructed in an event , resulting in the event failing the selection criteria . a partial correction for this",
    "was provided by determining the probability that all possible reconstructed leading tracks would be missed for each event using the known tracking efficiencies , and then dividing the event weight by this probability .",
    "this process will in general yield an excessive correction , since the correct weight should be determined using the number and distributions of true charged particles with @xmath38 and @xmath4 rather than the distributions of reconstructed tracks .",
    "this leads to an over - estimation of the probability for the event to be omitted .",
    "nevertheless , this correction represents a good estimate of the efficiency , given the efficiency estimate of tracks in each event .",
    "the efficiency was found to be @xmath60 in low - bins and almost @xmath61 in high - bins . the uncertainty for this correction is included as part of the tracking efficiency systematic uncertainty .",
    "the correction was made with the expectation that the final unfolding in the form of bin - by - bin corrections will provide the small additional correction that is needed .",
    "the total correction applied to account for events lost due to the trigger , vertex , and tracking requirements ( in bins of number of tracks with @xmath62 ) is given by @xmath63 where @xmath55 , @xmath57 and @xmath59 are the trigger , vertex reconstruction and leading track reconstruction efficiencies discussed earlier .      the track - reconstruction efficiency in each bin of the @xmath64@xmath14 kinematic plane ,",
    "was determined from simulation and defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of reconstructed tracks in a given bin matched to a generated charged particle , and @xmath67 is the number of generated particles in that bin . the matching between a generated particle and a reconstructed track was done using a cone - matching algorithm in the @xmath14@xmath7 plane and associating the particle to the track with the smallest @xmath68 within a cone of radius . to reduce fake matching , a common pixel hit between the reconstructed , simulated track and the generated particle track in the geant4 simulation was also required .",
    "the efficiencies were slightly different between the datasets at the two different center - of - mass energies because of small differences in the configuration of the pixel and sct detectors between the 2009 and 2010 data - taking periods .    a weight",
    ", @xmath69 was applied on a track - by - track basis to all track - level histograms . here",
    "@xmath70 is the track - reconstruction efficiency described earlier , @xmath71 is the fraction of secondaries , and @xmath72 is the fraction of fakes .",
    "the efficiency corrections described so far do not account for bin - by - bin migrations , nor for the possibility of not reconstructing the leading particle in the event as the leading track ( reorientation of an event ) . to account for these effects ,",
    "an additional bin - by - bin unfolding was applied to all distributions after applying the event- and track - level efficiency corrections described above .    in this correction step ,",
    "the unfolding factors were evaluated separately in each bin for each observable listed in table  [ tab : obs ] , @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively represent the generator level mc value of the observable and the reconstructed mc value after applying the event- and track - level efficiency corrections at each bin .",
    "the corrected value for an observable is found by multiplying the measured value by the corresponding unfolding factor .",
    "this unfolding factor is within 5% ( 10% ) of unity in the lowest - bins for the @xmath32 ( ) analyses respectively , due to the migration and reorientation effects , and very close to unity for higher - bins .",
    "a study of the systematic uncertainties was performed , and these were propagated to the final distributions and added in quadrature to obtain a total systematic uncertainty .",
    "systematic uncertainties from tracking efficiency were studied  @xcite , and the largest were found to be due to the following :    * the material in the inner detector : the effect of material budget uncertainties in the inner detector was determined to affect the efficiency by a relative difference of @xmath76 in the barrel region , rising to over @xmath77 for @xmath78 , for tracks with @xmath12 . * consequence of @xmath44 probability cut : the maximum difference between the fraction of events in data and mc which passed this cut was found to be 10% .",
    "this value was taken as a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty , applied to tracks with @xmath79 only .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from pile - up removal was estimated to be negligible .",
    "the most common ue observable is a `` profile '' plot of the mean value of a charged particle or multiplicity observable as a function of the of the leading object in the event . due to the steeply - falling spectrum in minimum bias events ,",
    "the number of events in the low - bins of these profiles is much higher than in the higher - bins , and so migration of the leading track from the lower - bins to higher ones is possible : this was accounted for in the mc - based unfolding procedure .",
    "however , an additional systematic uncertainty was included because more @xmath80migrations are expected in data than in the mc detector modelling .",
    "this extra systematic contributes only to the region of the profiles with @xmath81 , since a small fraction of highly mismeasured leading tracks from the lowest @xmath80bin can still have a significant effect upon the less - populated high-@xmath80bins .",
    "since the greatest difference from the @xmath80-profile values in @xmath81 is seen in the first @xmath80bin , a conservative systematic estimate was obtained by assuming all migrations to come from the first bin .",
    "the remaining contributions to the overall systematic uncertainty result from the specific unfolding method used in this analysis .",
    "the bin - by - bin unfolding corrections are in general influenced by the number of charged particles and their distributions , so there is some dependence on the event generator model .",
    "this introduces a second extra source of systematic uncertainty . in order to estimate this uncertainty",
    "it is necessary to compare different plausible event generation models , which deviate significantly from each other . between the various models and tunes",
    "already described , the maximal variation is seen between pythiaand phojet , and this difference is taken as a measure of the uncertainty due to model - dependence .",
    "where the phojetsample has sufficient statistics , it is seen that beyond the statistical fluctuations the relative difference between the required correction factors from phojetand pythiaare at most 4% in the lowest - bins , and 2% everywhere else . since this uncertainty is independent of any efficiency systematics , it has been summed in quadrature with the efficiency systematic uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty .",
    "in addition to the model - dependent uncertainty in the bin - by - bin unfolding , there is also a statistical uncertainty due to the finite size of the monte carlo sample .",
    "the statistical fluctuation of the pythiaunfolding factor is found to be negligible for low - bins , but rises to be a significant contribution in higher bins .     between the leading and the sub - leading track in pythia , phojetand in uncorrected data .",

    "[ fig : ldsld ] .",
    "it is seen to be most likely that the sub - leading charged particle lies in either the true toward or the true away region , in which case there is relatively little effect on the observables  the transverse region is particularly unaffected by a @xmath83 reorientation . however , if the reconstructed leading track lies in what should have been the transverse region , the effect will be to reduce the densities in the toward and away regions , and to increase the densities in the transverse region .",
    "the bin - by - bin unfolding derived from the mc corrects for this effect , provided that it occurs with the frequency of reorientation predicted by the mc simulation .",
    "[ fig : ldsld ] is used to estimate the relative frequency with which an event is reoriented such that the true towards and away regions lie in the transverse region identified by the reconstruction . comparing the @xmath82 distribution in uncorrected data to the same distributions",
    "( uncorrected and reconstructed ) predicted by pythiaand phojet , it is seen that both generator models predict fewer event reorientations of this type . the final correction to the data uses bin - by - bin unfolding factors that are derived from the pythiasample , so the relative magnitude of the systematic uncertainty associated with this effect can again be estimated by the difference of the pythiaand phojetprobabilities .",
    "this difference is comparable with the difference between the data and pythiapredictions .",

    "measurements of underlying event structure with the atlas detector have been presented , using the data delivered by the lhc during 2009 and 2010 at center - of - mass energies of and .",
    "this is the first underlying event analysis at , and the first such analysis at to be corrected for detector - specific effects .",
    "the data have been corrected with minimal model - dependence and are provided as inclusive distributions at the particle level . the selected phase - space and the precision of this analysis highlight significant differences between monte carlo models and the measured distributions .",
    "the same trend was observed for the atlas inclusive charged particle multiplicity measurement @xcite .",
    "phojet , herwig+jimmyand all pre - lhc mc tunes of pythiapredict less activity in the transverse region ( i.e in the underlying event ) than is actually observed , for both center - of - mass energies and for charged particle minimum requirements of both and .",
    "the charged particle multiplicity in the plateau of the transverse region distribution was found to be about two times higher than that of minimum bias particle density in the overall event .",
    "one of the goals of this analysis is to provide data that can be used to test and improve monte carlo models in preparation for other physics studies at the lhc .",
    "the underlying event observables presented here are particularly important for constraining the energy evolution of multiple partonic interaction models , since the plateau heights of the ue profiles are highly correlated to multiple parton interaction activity . as mc models of soft physics are least predictive when modeling diffractive processes , it is particularly useful that the ue profiles are largely insensitive to contributions from soft diffraction models : the pythiasoft diffraction model indicates that these are constrained to the lowest bins in @xmath80 .",
    "however , the sensitivity to more complete diffraction models with a hard component , such as implemented in pythia  8 @xcite or phojet , has not yet been fully ascertained .",
    "the data at are particularly important for mc tuning , since measurements are needed with at least two energies to constrain the energy evolution of mpi activity .",
    "while measurements from cdf exist at , and , in addition to these atlas measurements at and , there is a tension between the cdf and atlas measurements : the atlas analyses indicate higher levels of activity , as evidenced by the failure of mc tunes to cdf data to match the atlas data , but atlas measurements restricted to that @xmath14 range show the same discrepancy as seen for the @xmath4 results presented here . ] .",
    "hence , atlas ue measurement at two energies provides the best tuning data for mc predictions of atlas ue at higher energies .",
    "while the pythiadw tune fits the atlas ue profile data closer than any other current tune , it fails to describe other data  as highlighted in the shape of the distribution of @xmath102vs .",
    "@xmath106(fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) .",
    "the increase of initial state radiation activity ( and different shower models ) in tune dw may be responsible for this behavior .",
    "there is therefore no current standard mc tune which adequately describes all the early atlas data .",
    "however , using diffraction - limited minimum bias distributions and the plateau regions of the underlying event distributions presented here , atlas has developed a new pythiatune ambt1 ( atlas minimum bias tune 1 ) and a new herwig+jimmytune auet1 ( atlas underlying event tune 1 ) which model the and charged multiplicity spectra significantly better than the pre - lhc tunes of those generators  @xcite .",
