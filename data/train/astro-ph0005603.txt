    "iron k@xmath0 emission and the so - called reflection hump centered around @xmath2 kev are perhaps the only significant observational signatures of the presence of cold matter close to the event horizon around accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) .",
    "this is why many theory papers investigated x - ray reflection spectra from agn and gbhcs in great detail under the assumption that the matter is non - ionized or that the density of the illuminated layer is constant ( e.g. , lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 , ross & fabian 1993 ; matt , fabian & ross 1993 , 1996 ; @xmath3ycki et al . 1994 , and additional references in nk ) .",
    "basko , sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1974 ) ; kallman & white ( 1989 ) ; raymond ( 1993 ) ; ko & kallman ( 1994 ) ; r@xmath4aska & czerny ( 1996 ) relaxed the constant density assumption and all found that the thermal ionization instability ( krolik et al .",
    "1981 ) plays a central role in establishing the equilibrium temperature and density profiles of the x - ray illuminated gas .",
    "nayakshin , kazanas & kallman ( 2000 ; hereafter nkk ) extended results of these authors by providing accurate radiation transfer for illuminating spectra appropriate for the inner part of ads in agn and gbhcs . the results of nkk show that a self - consistent gas density determination may provide valuable physical insights into the problem that allow one to put tight constraints on ad theories .    as an example , nayakshin & kallman ( 2000 ; nk hereafter ) considered the x - ray illumination problem in the three different ad geometries : ( 1 ) the `` lamppost '' geometry , where the x - ray source is located above the black hole at some height @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) full corona geometry ( e.g. , liang & price 1979 ) and ( 3 ) the two - phase patchy corona model ( e.g. , galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; and svensson 1996 ) .",
    "they pointed out that the reflected spectra and correlations between the x - ray continuum and the atomic features , such as the fe k@xmath0 line and the associated edge are very different for these three geometries . here",
    "we present the full disk spectra for the lamppost and the flare models and broadly compare our theoretical predictions to current observations of agn .",
    "we find that a number of observational facts rules out the lamppost model geometry and , at the same time , supports the magnetic flare origin for the x - rays .",
    "( note that we do not discuss here the advection dominated accretion flows ( e.g. , ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) or modifications of this model due to winds ( e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) since these models are not expected to work for many luminous agn that have broad iron lines  see the recent review by fabian et al .",
    "[ 2000 ] ) .",
    "our main argument is based on two simple concepts . the first one has to do with geometrical differences between the lamppost and the flare models . in the former ,",
    "the central x - ray source illuminates the disk `` evenly '' in the sense that the local illuminating flux at every radius is the same as the azimuthal average of that flux . in the case of flares",
    ", however , there may be many x - ray sources located anywhere above the inner ad and only several disk height scales above it ( e.g. , galeev et al .",
    "1979 ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; nayakshin 1998 ) .",
    "if the covering fraction of the disk by the flares is @xmath6 , then around the flare location ( where most of the x - ray reflection takes place ) , the illuminating flux if roughly @xmath7 times larger than the average of that flux .",
    "therefore , for the same x - ray luminosity , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the disk bolometric luminosity , the illuminating x - ray flux is @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for the lamppost and flare models , respectively , where @xmath12 is the intrinsic disk thermal flux ( see also fig . 1 and estimates in nayakshin & dove 2000 ) .",
    "the second point is that the compton temperature  the maximum gas temperature reached in the x - ray illuminated skin on the top of the disk  sensitively depends on the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the compton temperature due to the illuminating x - radiation only , which for typical seyfert galaxies spectra work out to be around several to 10 kev .",
    "then ( e.g. , begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ) , @xmath15 where we used @xmath16 , and where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the angle integrated intensity of the x - rays and the soft disk flux , respectively .",
    "forgetting for the moment complications due to the angle averaging of radiation and its transfer through the skin , @xmath19 , and hence the geometry of the x - ray source directly influences @xmath20 .",
    "nk made these arguments more precise by solving the x - ray illumination problem at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the schwartzchild radius ) in the lamppost geometry with the following `` reasonable '' parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , photon spectral index @xmath25 and the exponential cutoff energy @xmath26 kev .",
    "the gas temperature on the top of the skin turns out to be only @xmath27 ev .",
    "in contrast , in the magnetic flare case ( nk assumed that @xmath28 ) , the gas temperature on the top of the skin to climb to about 4 kev ( see figs . 1 & 5 in nk ) . not surprisingly , this large difference in the gas temperature leads to as profound a difference in the ionization structure of the gas .",
    "for the lamppost geometry , a large fraction of iron in the skin is in the form of helium - like iron . for the flare case ,",
    "on the other hand , the skin is dominated by the completely ionized iron .",
    "figure [ fig : ew]a shows the ratio of the column depth of the he - like iron in the skin to that of the completely ionized iron for the lamppost and the flare models as a function of @xmath29 for runs w1-w9 and h1-h7 presented in nk , where @xmath30 is the illuminating x - ray flux of the test with the lowest value of @xmath1 ( w1 and h1 , respectively ) . for the lamppost , he - like iron dominates by factor of few over completely ionized iron in the skin , whereas for the magnetic flare case , he - like ions are only few percent of the total iron line column depth in the skin .",
    "the presence or absence of he - like iron in the skin makes it to play two opposite roles for the reflected spectra . because he - like iron has much higher fluorescence yield than neutral - like iron below the skin , the warm skin yields a higher iron line emissivity than the one from a non - ionized matter .",
    "however , when the skin is completely ionized , it obstructs penetration of the incident x - rays to the cooler layers below where the compton reflection hump and the fluorescent line are formed , and further wash out these features by compton scattering when the line photons propagate through the skin to the observer ( see nkk ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ew]b shows the dependence of the iron k@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) on the x - ray flux .",
    "clearly , the dependence of the ew on @xmath31 is opposite for the two models . in both cases , the thomson depth of the skin increases with the x - ray luminosity",
    "( see nayakshin 2000 ) , but because the skin in lamppost model is he - like - dominated , this leads to an increase in the line s ew , whereas for the completely ionized skin , it brings about a decrease in ew ( the cool matter below the skin is less and less `` visible '' ) .",
    "nk set several tests where they varied the ratio @xmath32 to determine how high it should be to completely ionize the skin in the lamppost case .",
    "it turned out that this ratio needs to be as high as @xmath33 or larger , because otherwise the gas temperature on the _ bottom _ of the skin falls far below the estimate given by equation 1 with @xmath34 ( see  6.3.1 and figs . 13 - 15 in nk ) .",
    "however , values of @xmath35 are in conflict with the fact that many agn have uv fluxes exceeding their x - ray fluxes ( e.g. , ngc  3516 , edelson et al .",
    "finally , nk showed that in the geometry of a full corona sandwiching the cold disk , the additional weight / pressure of the corona is so high that no ionized skin can form , and thus the reflected spectra should resemble those of a neutral reflector .",
    "the ew of the iron k@xmath0 line is constant in this model ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ew]b ) .",
    "in order to obtain full disk spectra , we calculate the local reflected spectra , @xmath36 , with the code of nkk and nk for 6 different radii @xmath37 and 105 .",
    "we assume that the reflected spectrum for @xmath38 is given by that for @xmath39 , and the one for @xmath40 is the one for @xmath41 .",
    "further , for radius @xmath42 , we define the reflected spectrum to be @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for simplicity of notations , we dropped the dependency of @xmath36 on the cosine of the viewing angle , @xmath46 , and photon energy , @xmath47 . in practice ,",
    "we calculate the reflected spectrum for 10 different viewing angles @xmath48 that are measured from the normal to the disk , such that @xmath49 0.05 , 0.15 , ... , 0.95 .",
    "we then interpolate in a linear fashion in @xmath50 ( analogous to equation [ iofr ] ) to obtain the reflected spectrum for an intermediate value of @xmath50 .",
    "the full spectra are obtained via integrating over the disk surface . to take into account the relativistic smearing in the schwartzchild geometry of a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "we include gravitational redshift in the photon energy and doppler boosting due to keplerian disk rotation , but we neglect the ray bending in the vicinity of the black hole . since we only consider regions with @xmath51 , and",
    "since the maximum of the x - ray illuminating flux occurs at yet larger radii , we believe that this approximation is adequate for our study here .",
    "both models are calculated for a @xmath52 solar masses black hole for dimensionless accretion rates : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , 1 , ... , 4 ( @xmath55 corresponds to the eddington luminosity ) .",
    "we assume @xmath56 , @xmath57 and that the illuminating power - law extends to @xmath58 kev where it is sharply cut .",
    "it is perhaps fair to say that moderate to high luminosity lamppost spectra are rather unusual in that they display strong non - power - law features at soft x - ray energies , very strong he - like iron line at @xmath59 kev , and also a rather deep and high energy fe absorption edge ( blended with fe ly continuum , see nk ) .",
    "these are generally _ not _ observed in the spectra of real agn or gbhcs .",
    "note that the lower normalization of the reflected spectrum of the lamppost case compared with that for the magnetic flare case is due to two factors : ( i ) there is a hole underneath the lamppost so that a part of the flux never reflects ; ( ii ) the x - ray continuum from magnetic flares is itself beamed along the disk surface and smeared so that the observer perpendicular to the disk observes less of the continuum flux than in the lamppost case for the same _ intrinsic _ @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra]b shows that below k@xmath0 iron line feature , the magnetic flare spectra are practically pure power - laws , which is due to the fact that the skin is completely ionized . as shown by done & nayakshin ( 2000 ) , spectra for the magnetic flare model _ can _ be fitted reasonably well by the standard single - zone reflection amid a lower normalization for the reflection hump , i.e. , these spectra do appear to be similar to the typical agn and even hard state gbhc spectra .",
    "a search for the iron line reverberation in response to continuum variations was the goal of recent observations of mcg63015 ( lee et al .",
    "2000 ; reynolds 2000 ) and ngc 5548 ( chiang et al .",
    "these authors showed that whereas the continuum x - ray flux was strongly variable on short time scales , the iron k@xmath0 line flux stayed roughly constant on these time scales and formally did not vary during the whole observation , which is far longer than the light crossing time of the innermost region .",
    "this seems to argue that the reflection takes place very far from the black hole ",
    "e.g. , in the putative molecular torus . however , the line profile is _ broad _ , indicating that most of its flux does come from the region rather close to the black hole .",
    "according to figure [ fig : ew]b , the lamppost geometry and the full corona case can not explain the lack of iron line reverberation , because that requires the ew of the line to drop with increase in the x - ray flux approximately as ew@xmath60 , whereas it increases with @xmath61 for the lamppost model and stays constant for the full corona geometry .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic flare model can potentially explain these interesting observations because the skin is completely ionized in this model and thus the ew of the line decreases with the x - ray flux .",
    "nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that ew of the iron line monotonically decreases with the increasing @xmath1 for a sample of agn ( the x - ray `` baldwin '' effect ) .",
    "this study is corroborated by observations of vignali et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who found that the available data for luminous ( high @xmath62 ) quasars indicate that the latter lack the reflection component and also have no or weak iron lines .",
    "this suggests that either there is no cold matter near the x - ray source , or it is hidden by a thomson thick and completely ionized skin ( as suggested by nayakshin 2000 )",
    ". the former possibility would be somewhat unexpected because the currently popular ad theories either have the cold disk going all the way to the last stable orbit black hole ( e.g. , magnetic flares , lamppost ) for all accretion rates , or suggest that the hot part of the accretion flow diminishes with increase in @xmath63 and eventually disappears ( e.g. , esin , mcclintok & narayan 1997 ; see also  6.1 in fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) . in other words , in all these theories",
    "the luminous quasars are expected to have cold disk persisting down to the last stable orbit , and hence the absence of the line and reflection have to be explained by the ionization physics effects ( unless x - ray sources relativistically move away from the disk ",
    "see beloborodov 1999  the more so the higher @xmath1 is ) . out of the two models ,",
    "the lamppost is clearly ruled out while the magnetic flare model seems quite viable .",
    "further , the full disk spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) show that the lamppost model predicts many strong features due to oxygen , mg , si and other elements in soft x - rays , practically as prominent as those in the iron recombination band , and an enormous ew for the iron line , and a notably large iron absorption edge at @xmath64 kev .",
    "such spectra are uncommon for real agn , which again argues against the lamppost model . on the other hand , crudely speaking , the reflected spectra of the magnetic flare model is a combination of the mirror - like reflection from the completely ionized skin and the cold - like reflection hump and fe k@xmath0 line formed in the cold layers below the skin .",
    "these spectra do appear to be neutral ( for @xmath65 , see nkk ) and are reminiscent of spectra of real agn and hard state gbhcs ( see done & nayakshin 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , while some seyfert 1 agn do have extremely broadened iron lines like mcg63015 ( e.g. ngc 3516 ; nandra et al .",
    "1999 ) , others do not have the extreme skewed lines expected from the very inner disk ( e.g. ic4329a ; done , madejski & @xmath3ycki  2000 ) .",
    "as is clear from figure 2b , the magnetic flare model can explain both of these facts if we suggest that broad iron line agn are those with low @xmath66 or so , whereas narrow iron line agn accrete at larger @xmath67 such that the skin in their inner disk completely destroys the broad line component .",
    "note that the lamppost model again fails here , because its skin increases the line ew ( see fig .",
    "therefore , it emerges that the current observations indicate that the ionized skin is indeed present on the top of accretion disks in agn and that it is _ completely _ ionized .",
    "the latter is only possible if the illuminating x - ray flux is much larger than the disk flux , which is most natural for accretion disks with magnetic flares occurring above the disk .",
    "the condition @xmath68 is in the fact the basic assumption of the two - patchy phase model ( same as the magnetic flare model ) , because this requirement is central in producing the x - ray continuum spectra as hard as those observed and for a broad range of the parameter space ( e.g. , haardt et al .",
