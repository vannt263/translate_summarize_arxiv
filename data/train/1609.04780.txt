    "we have shown that the detected surface has slope 0 . however , these knots have a unique essential seifert surface , so the detected surface is the seifert surface described in ( see the corollary to proposition 1 in @xcite ) .",

    "there are finitely many characters of reducible representations in @xmath118 .",

    "could these representations be faithful ?",

    "the alexander polynomial of @xmath391 must divide @xmath389 ( see e.g. remark ( 3 ) of ( * ? ? ? * proposition 1.11 ) ) and furthermore , @xmath391 is necessarily a two - bridge knot ( * ? ? ?",

    "another way in which non - canonical components of characters of irreducible representations can arise in the character variety is when the knot has a certain nice symmetry described by ohtsuki . in particular , whenever a two - bridge knot has two - bridge normal form @xmath404 with @xmath405 and @xmath406 , there is a diagram from which one can see an orientation preserving involution .",
    "this involution induces a nontrivial action on the character variety .",

    "must all intersection points between these components detect essential surfaces",
    "? must all intersection points be algebraic non - integral with the meridian non - integral over the prime 2 ?",
    "what about for general knots ?",
    "the affine intersections points for the knot @xmath408 with normal form @xmath416 all detect the slope 6 . in particular , all the affine intersection points are galois conjugates and detect the same surface , this is also the case for the knots @xmath409 with normal form @xmath417 , @xmath410 with normal form @xmath418 , and @xmath412 with normal form @xmath420 which detect the slopes 6 , 18 , and 10 respectively .",
    "we note that there are epimorphisms from the knot groups for @xmath410 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 to trefoil group .",

    "whenever a knot is fibered , a seifert surface can not be detected by ideal nor by algebraic non - integral points in the character variety .",
    "one may also want to consider two - bridge knots with three distinct components of irreducible representations in the character variety .",
    "two examples of these are the knots @xmath425 and @xmath426 with two - bridge normal forms @xmath427 and @xmath428 both of which satisfy the symmetry condition described above and provide epimorphisms to the trefoil group .",
    "these two knots each have character varieties with a canonical component , a distinct component corresponding to the symmetry condition , and a distinct component corresponding to the canonical component of the character variety of the trefoil .",
    "all pairwise intersection points between these three components are algebraic non - integral with the trace of the meridian non - integral by a prime over 2 , and correspond to irreducible representations .",
