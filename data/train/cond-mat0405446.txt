    "the thermomagnetic instability or flux jumping is commonly observed at low temperatures in type - ii superconductors with strong pinning .",
    "@xcite the instability arises because of two fundamental reasons : ( i ) motion of magnetic flux releases energy , and hence increases the local temperature ; ( ii ) the temperature rise decreases flux pinning , and hence facilitates the flux motion .",
    "this positive feedback can result in thermal runaways and global flux redistributions jeopardizing superconducting devices .",
    "this mechanism was understood in early works,@xcite and later on the thermomagnetic instability was studied thoroughly ( see refs .   for a review ) . in particular ,",
    "the threshold magnetic field for the instability was calculated and its experimentally found dependence on temperature , sample dimensions , and the applied field ramping rate were explained .",
    "the conventional theory of the thermomagnetic instability@xcite predicts `` uniform '' flux jumps , where the flux front is essentially flat . in other words ,",
    "the spatial extension of the instability region tends to be maximal since small - scale perturbations are stabilized by thermal diffusion .",
    "this picture is true for many experimental conditions , however , not for all .",
    "numerous magneto - optical studies have revealed that the thermomagnetic instability in thin superconducting samples results in dendritic flux patterns.@xcite in course of the dendritic instability the flux forms narrow `` fingers '' of typical width 2050  @xmath2 m and length up to the size of the sample .",
    "such a behavior clearly contradicts to the conventional theoretical concepts and needs elucidation .",

    "@xcite molecular dynamics simulations of flux quanta motion in superconducting film@xcite can model dendritic flux and temperature patterns similar to those found experimentally .",
    "however , these numerical results still lack analytical support .",
    "in particular , it is still unclear what kind of spatial structure can be formed during a flux jump , and under what conditions .",
    "a similar problem was analyzed in a recent work@xcite where the propagating flux front was shown to acquire a non - uniform spatial structure if its speed is higher than some critical value , and the conductivity is a strong function of flux density . in the present study",
    "it is shown that these assumptions are not necessary requirements for a superconductor to develop nonuniform flux jumps .    in the present paper the spatial pattern of the instability in a bulk superconductor",
    "is studied using the conventional approach@xcite  linear analysis of a set of differential equations describing small perturbations in the electric field @xmath3 and temperature @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the previous investigations , we allow the perturbations to vary in any direction , i. e. , both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the background current @xmath5 and field @xmath6 . in this way",
    "we determine the stability criteria and also estimate the instability build - up time . as a main result",
    "we find that the most unstable perturbations are in the form of narrow fingers perpendicular to the background field @xmath6 and occur if @xmath3 is larger than some threshold value .",
    "this shape prevents current adjustment across the perturbed region and , hence , yields the fastest perturbation growth .",
    "too narrow fingers are , however , suppressed by the thermal diffusion .",

    "a quasi - static critical state with @xmath22 is formed .",
    "this will be the initial state from which the instability evolves .",

    "the exact form of the current - voltage curve , = j(t , e ) ( /e ) .",
    "[ cvcf ] is not crucially important .",
    "the only important point is that the @xmath24 curve is very steep , and therefore its logarithmic derivative is large : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the differential conductivity , @xmath27 at low electric fields , the @xmath24 curve is often approximated by a power law , i. e. , @xmath28 is assumed independent of @xmath3 , and @xmath29 .",

    "we then find the following values for the characteristic fields , @xmath182  t , and @xmath183  v / m , a finger width of @xmath184 m for @xmath185 , and a build - up time of the instability , @xmath54 , in the @xmath2s range .",
    "these estimates are not far from those reported in experimental papers , namely dendritic fingers of width  20 - 50  @xmath2m,@xcite and the instability build - up time of @xmath186s.@xcite the criterion for the fingering instability @xmath0 can also be written down as @xmath187 . using the numbers above",
    "we find @xmath188 , which is a reasonable value for the flux - flow conductivity .",
    "correspondingly , for @xmath189 one obtains @xmath190 .",
    "note that the electric field , @xmath191 , needed for the finger instability to occur is not very small . as an estimate ,",
    "the magnetic field ramp rate @xmath192 that induces the electric field @xmath191 is of the order of 10@xmath176  t / s for @xmath193=1  mm .",
    "rates of similar magnitude are conventionally used for pulsed magnetization of superconducting permanent magnets.@xcite in experiments reporting the fingering instability@xcite the ramp rates were much smaller .",
    "one should keep in mind however that the actual electric field can be much larger than it follows from the simple estimate @xmath194 .",
    "the reason is a strong non - uniformity of the flux penetration both in space and in time , see for review ref .  .",
    "hence , one can expect rather large local electric fields that last longer than the inverse instability increment , @xmath195s .",
    "other sources of large electric fields include random fluctuations of the superconductor parameters due to , e.  g. , relaxation of mechanical stresses .",
    "a very large electric field can be also created on purpose , e.  g. , by a laser pulse , which nucleates highly nonuniform flux distributions.@xcite    in any case , it is rather difficult to meet the fingering instability criterion , @xmath196",
    ". this might be the reason why fingering is hardly observed in bulk samples .",
    "we are aware of only one experimental work@xcite where an indication of the discussed fingering instability in relatively thick samples ( with thickness up to 2  mm ) was obtained .",
    "another possible reason for why such observations are few is that flux jumps in bulk superconductors are often complete , or almost complete .",
    "this means that the temperature rises close to @xmath38 in the entire sample , leading to a uniform flux distribution which erases any trace of a possible non - uniformity in the first stages of the flux jump .",
    "that contrasts the behavior in thin film samples , where the jumps are usually much smaller and far from being complete.@xcite this makes non - uniform jumps easier observable in films.@xcite moreover , huge stresses usually exist between a superconducting film and substrate .",
    "abrupt relaxation of these stresses can lead to fluctuations in @xmath3 , especially for nb@xmath197sn or mgb@xmath198 where the superconducting properties depend strongly on the strain.@xcite note also that in films it is much more probable that any perturbation of electric field will influence the whole thickness , whereas it will affect only a small part of a bulk sample .",
    "although our equations for a slab can not be directly applied to the case of a thin film , we expect that essentially the same physics describes the formation of finger structures in the films too.@xcite moreover , non- locality of the current - field relations in films can make formation of non - uniform structures there even more favorable , and possibly account for the branching flux patterns observed experimentally .",
    "the presence of a background electric field @xmath6 , and hence moving magnetic flux implies that the background state itself is not stationary . in a typical experiment , the applied magnetic field is increasing @xmath199 , the flux front is moving into the sample , @xmath200 , and hence the electric field is non - stationary within the flux - penetrated region .",
    "obviously , our analytical results are valid only if all these quantities change in time slower than the perturbations @xmath201 grow , i.  e. , when @xmath202 .",
    "if the electric field is created by ramping the external magnetic field , @xmath203 $ ] , then @xmath204 .",
    "using that @xmath205 , we can rewrite the above inequality as @xmath206 . since @xmath121 this condition is satisfied in the major part of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ f_he ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "a linear analysis of heat diffusion and maxwell equations shows that a thermomagnetic instability may result in finger - like distributions of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath23 .",
    "the fingering instability arises if the background electric field is so high that the magnetic flux diffusion proceeds much faster than the heat diffusion .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that upon further development of the instability one finger starts growing much faster than the others , and propagates into the flux - free region .",
