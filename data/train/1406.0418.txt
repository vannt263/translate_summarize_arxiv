    "the interfacial free energy between a crystal phase in coexistence with its liquid phase , @xmath0 , is an important thermodynamic quantity which controls the rate of homogeneous nucleation and the morphology of a crystal growing from its melt  @xcite .",

    "even a small dependence on the orientation of the crystal , e.g. , may significantly affect the final microstructure of the growing crystal and the materials properties of the resulting crystal .",
    "moreover , the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy also affects the barrier for the formation of a nucleus near a wall as well as the wetting behavior of the crystal .    in spite of its central importance for a proper understanding of growth and nucleation phenomena , reliable experimental data for @xmath0",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and angioletti - uberti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , known as tethered monte carlo and metadynamics , respectively .",
    "these methods render accurate estimates of @xmath0 with relatively moderate system sizes ( less than @xmath2 particles ) .",
    "however , both approaches rely on a local order parameter which has been specified only for the ( 100 ) orientation of the fcc crystal structure .    in contrast",
    ", thermodynamic integration ( ti )  @xcite can yield a direct estimate of @xmath0 for various crystal structures , without the necessity of introducing local order parameters and with system sizes of a few thousand atoms .",
    "the determination of @xmath0 from thermodynamic integration is based on the definition that the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy is the reversible work required to create a unit area of the crystal - liquid interface  @xcite .",
    "hence , one needs to find a reversible path bringing together independent liquid and crystal phases to create two crystal - liquid interfaces in equilibrium with the bulk phases .",
    "broughton and gilmer  @xcite first introduced a ti scheme to compute @xmath0 for a modified lennard - jones ( lj ) potential .",
    "their method consisted of using specially designed  cleaving potentials \" to gradually split each phase into two blocks divided by a cleaving plane , then bringing these blocks together , and finally removing the  cleaving potential \" . however , designing  cleaving \" potentials for various orientations of the crystal , at different coexistence conditions and for different potentials is clearly an arduous task and the  cleaving potentials \" proposed by them can not be easily generalized . moreover , their calculations were not precise enough to resolve the anisotropy in @xmath0 .",
    "davidchack and laird  @xcite modified the approach of broughton and gilmer by using planar ",

    "the data reported by them were precise enough to resolve the anisotropy in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the ti paths corresponding to both the broughton - gilmer and davidchack - laird approaches are subject to hysteresis in the final step , when the `` cleaving walls '' or the `` cleaving potential '' is removed . due to thermal fluctuations",
    ", the two crystal - liquid interfaces can change their position by simultaneous freezing and melting  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "their location will no longer coincide with the position of the cleaving plane , leading to hysteresis between the forward and reverse ti paths .",
    "some authors have tried to adopt the `` cleaving walls '' ti scheme of davidchack and laird  @xcite into a non - equilibrium work measurement approach  @xcite .",
    "such an approach is independent of the reversibility of the transformation  @xcite .",
    "however , the non - equilibrium work measurement still requires one to be able to reach the initial state from the final state when the transformations are carried out in the reverse direction .",
    "due to the movement of the crystal - liquid interface , this is not possible .",
    "the hysteresis arising from the mobility of the crystal - liquid interface seems to be a difficult problem to eliminate completely .",
    "though , davidchack and laird  @xcite tried to deal with this issue by performing several independent ti runs and choosing the run with the least hysteresis .    in this work",
    ", we propose a novel thermodynamic integration scheme to compute @xmath0 from molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "our scheme circumvents the key problem due to the mobility of the crystal - liquid interface by the use of a very short ranged flat wall ( modelled by a gaussian potential ) to split the crystal and liquid phases .",
    "such a short - ranged wall demands that the integration of the equations of motion is carried out with a very small time step .",
    "however , this disadvantage can be offset by the use of a multiple time step scheme  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this short - ranged wall to the final value of the interfacial free energy itself is negligible ( much less than the statistical errors and less than @xmath3 of the final value of @xmath0 ) .",
    "in addition to this short - ranged flat wall , we also insert a structured solid wall consisting of frozen - in crystalline layers , to gradually bring together in a smooth manner the individual crystal and liquid phases split by the flat wall .",
    "we employ our thermodynamic integration scheme to compute @xmath0 for a modified lennard - jones potential , though our scheme can also be used for more complex potentials .    in order to determine @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we use a careful analysis of finite - size effects in the framework of capillary wave theory @xcite .",
    "although the finite - size effects turn out to be relatively small for systems containing more than about 20000 particles , our finite - size analysis is nicely consistent with the prediction of capillary - wave theory and thus this demonstrates that our ti scheme does not lead to a suppression of capillary - wave fluctuations .",
    "this indicates that the gaussian flat walls introduced in our scheme indeed lead to negligibly small perturbation of the system .    in the next section ( sec .",

    "broughton and gilmer  @xcite proposed a modified lj potential with a cut - off at @xmath10 that provides continuity of potential and force at @xmath11 .",

    "particles in the blue and green simulation boxes represent the crystal and the liquid phase , respectively . for details see text.,width=288 ]    the interfacial free energy @xmath0 is the excess free energy required to form an interface between a crystal and a liquid at coexistence . since it is an excess free energy , given by the difference between the free energies of a final and an initial state , it can be directly computed via ti . while the initial state is given by two independent systems , namely a bulk crystal and a bulk liquid at coexistence temperature and pressure",
    ", the final state is an inhomogeneous system where the liquid and the crystal phase are separated from each other by two interfaces . when constructing the reversible thermodynamic path between the initial and the final state ,",
    "the bulk regions of the two phases should be perturbed as little as possible and no stress should be generated in the crystal when it gets in contact with the liquid .",
    "a crucial step in our ti scheme is the introduction of an extremely short - ranged flat wall which is modelled by a repulsive gaussian potential and placed at the boundaries of the simulation box in @xmath23 direction .",
    "the range of the particle interactions with this wall is chosen such that it is about @xmath24 times less than the typical size of the particles .",
    "thus , the gaussian wall only prevents the liquid and crystalline particles from crossing the boundaries of their simulation boxes but does not change the thermodynamic properties of the bulk system in any manner . due to the extremely short - range nature of the wall , a very small time - step is needed to integrate the equations of motion in a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "however , one can use a multiple time - step molecular dynamics algorithm to tackle this issue  @xcite and since only a few particles interact with the short - ranged wall , the additional computational overhead in implementing this algorithm is small ( i.e.  the simulations with gaussian walls are less than a factor of two slower than corresponding simulations without these walls ) .    to ensure minimal perturbation of the crystal when",
    "the two phases are brought together , it is essential that the liquid is already ordered into crystalline layers near the interface , compatible with the actual crystal structure . in our ti scheme , this is achieved by introducing a structured solid wall , consisting of particles frozen into a configuration adopted in an actual simulation of the crystal phase . interactions between the system and this structured wall were modelled by the same interaction potential as that between the system particles .",
    "such a structured solid wall leads to formation of interfacial layers in the liquid which are more compatible with the actual crystal structure than if the structured wall consisted of particles fixed to an ideal crystal position as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the starting points of our ti scheme are the simulations of a bulk crystal and a bulk liquid under coexistence conditions ( see sec .",

    "both the liquid and the crystal are simulated in cubic boxes of identical dimensions ( @xmath25 ) but at their respective coexistence densities , assuming periodic boundary conditions in all spatial directions .",
    "the goal is to join simulation boxes with the liquid and the crystal phase along the @xmath23 direction and thereby create two independent crystal - liquid interfaces in equilibrium with the bulk phases ( with the total dimension @xmath26 ) .",
    "our ti scheme consists of the following sequence of steps to carry out this transformation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tischeme ] ) :    _ step 1 _ : insert an extremely short - ranged gaussian flat wall at both ends of the liquid simulation box along the @xmath23 direction [ sketch ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tischeme ] ] , while keeping the periodic boundary conditions intact .",
    "the wall should be strong enough to prevent the liquid particles from crossing the boundaries and be extremely short - ranged such that the interfacial free energy of the liquid in contact with this wall is negligible as compared to @xmath0 ( in our case , typically less than the statistical errors reported in previous works  @xcite ) .",
    "_ step 2 _ : identical flat walls are inserted at the boundaries of the simulation box containing the crystal [ ( 2 ) in fig .  [ fig : tischeme ] ] such that the distance of the closest crystalline layer from the flat wall is identical for both the left and right boundaries of the simulation cell .",
    "_ step 3 _ : two solid walls are constructed from the left and right parts of the crystal simulation cell near the two boundaries , containing 2 - 3 layers of crystalline particles .",
    "then , these walls are gradually attached to the liquid simulation cell at the appropriate ends , with the flat walls still switched on , to prevent particles from crossing the boundaries . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tischeme ] , the wall constructed from the left part of the crystal simulation cell is attached to the right end of the liquid simulation cell .",
    "similarly , the wall made from the right side of the crystalline simulation cell is attached to the left side of the liquid phase . at the same time , the periodic boundary conditions of the liquid simulation cell in @xmath23 direction are gradually switched off . in this respect , this step is unlike the procedure adopted in previous ti schemes , where the boundary conditions are kept intact while switching on the `` cleaving '' walls .",
    "_ step 4 _ : the same frozen - in parts of the crystal simulation cell are gradually introduced to the appropriate boundaries of the simulation box containing the actual crystalline phase , in presence of the flat walls , and simultaneously the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath23 direction are turned off [ cf .",
    "( 4 ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : tischeme ] ] .    _ step 5 _ : the liquid and crystal systems are brought together and simultaneously the frozen - in crystalline walls are removed , in presence of the flat walls .",
    "this is accomplished by joining appropriate ends of the crystal and liquid simulation cells , where the flat walls are located . doing this entails juxtaposing the solid wall in contact with one phase to be on top of the other phase .",
    "however , both phases interacted only with their respective solid walls . since the periodic boundary conditions for the individual phases were already switched off , one needs only to switch on interactions between the two phases across the ends connected directly and also across the other end via gradually turning on the periodic boundary conditions [ cf .",
    "( 5 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tischeme ] ] .",
    "this procedure is different from that followed by the `` cleaving potential '' or `` cleaving walls '' approach , where the liquid and crystal are first joined together and only in the next step , the `` cleaving walls '' are removed .    at the end of step 5 ,",
    "the system consists of crystal and liquid phases separated by two interfaces , whose position coincides with the position of the flat walls . since , the crystal and liquid particles can not cross the boundaries of their respective simulation cells , the position of the crystal - liquid interface is tied to the position of the flat walls . if we proceed in a reverse direction from the end of step 5 , and then retrace each prior step , we will end up exactly from where the transformation started , i.e.  the liquid and crystal phases at coexistence in separate simulation cells .",
    "_ step 6 _ : finally , in the last step , the extremely short - ranged gaussian walls are gradually removed . when the the barrier imposed by the walls becomes weaker",
    ", the particles can cross the boundaries of their simulation cells . as a result the interfaces can move leading to hysteresis in the thermodynamic integration path .",
    "however , our scheme is successful in tackling the hysteresis arising from the mobility of the crystal - liquid interface , because the contribution of the last step to @xmath0 is negligible ( less than the combined statistical errors of steps 3 , 4 and 5 ) , on account of the extremely short - ranged flat walls .",
    "this ensures that any residual hysteresis in the last step is also reduced to a negligible amount , thus having no impact on the accuracy of the estimates .",
    "this is a more desirable way to circumvent the problem rather than the cumbersome approach of carrying out several forward and reverse ti runs of various durations and choosing the path with the least hysteresis  @xcite .    in our ti calculations ,",
    "we carry out the sequence of transformations outlined above by directly modifying the interaction potential of the flat walls and the frozen - in crystalline walls .",
    "this approach is similar to our earlier work on the determination of interfacial free energies of liquid or crystal phases in contact with flat or structured walls  @xcite .    in all the steps of our ti scheme , the parameter @xmath27 is coupled to the interaction potentials in a non - linear rather than a linear manner  @xcite",
    "this is dictated by the need to obtain smooth thermodynamic integrands leading to an accurate numerical determination of the associated integrals .",

    "this creates a problem in the subsequent steps .",
    "since the solid walls inserted in steps 3 and 4 are made of frozen - in crystalline layers near the two ends of the crystal simulation cell , such asymmetry in the position of the crystal will lead to two dissimilar solid walls being made to come in contact with the liquid and crystal phases on either side .",
    "this would lead to an ordering in the liquid phase which is not compatible with the actual crystal structure .",
    "similarly , two walls with their outermost layers at different distances from the two sides of the crystal phase might lead to stresses in the crystal .    to avoid this , the two innermost layers of the crystalline phase were frozen such that the crystalline phase was symmetric with respect to the two boundaries .",
    "this ensured that the solid walls generated from such a symmetric crystal were similar and their outermost layers were at the same average distance from the two boundaries .",
    "this is similar to what was done in the `` cleaving wall '' approach  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : step1ti ] , we show the thermodynamic integrands for inserting the gaussian flat wall ( and removing for the reverse process ) into the crystal and liquid phases , respectively .",
    "good overlap of the forward and reverse thermodynamic integrands indicates , as expected , the lack of hysteresis in our ti scheme .",
    "as can be clearly seen in the figure , the area under the thermodynamic integrand corresponding to the crystal in contact with the flat wall is negligible as compared to the same situation for the liquid . on account of the extremely short range of the flat walls ,",
    "very few particles actually interact with them leading to a negligible contribution to the free energy difference .",
    "since the crystal is placed symmetrically with respect to the two ends of the simulation cell , the flat walls are located in the middle of two crystalline layers . therefore , their position coincides with a minimum of the crystal density leading to a negligible value for the free energy difference as compared to the liquid .",
    "the interfacial free energy of the liquid in contact with the flat wall is @xmath135 at @xmath1 when @xmath136 , which is of the order of @xmath137 of the final value of @xmath0 . in case of the crystal ,",
    "the contribution of this flat wall varies from @xmath138 for the ( 111 ) orientation to @xmath139 for the ( 100 ) orientation and @xmath140 for the ( 110 ) orientation . for this choice of @xmath31 ,",
    "the combined contribution of step 1 and step 2 was lower than the statistical errors in the most precise estimates of @xmath0 .    in the next two steps , liquid and crystalline phases were separately brought into contact with structured solid walls in presence of the gaussian flat wall and simultaneously the periodic boundary conditions were switched off .",
    "thermodynamic integrands corresponding to steps 3 and 4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step2ti ] . in step 3 ,",
    "the interaction strength @xmath75 was chosen at @xmath56 , while at the other temperatures @xmath141 .",
    "for the interaction of the crystal with the structured wall , at all temperatures @xmath72 was set to @xmath74 . as the @xmath27 parameter",
    "is gradually increased , the liquid begins to form ordered layers near the interface due to interactions with the solid wall .",
    "this process was the source of some hysteresis in the `` cleaving walls ''  @xcite and `` cleaving potentials ''  @xcite scheme , though it could be avoided by equilibrating the samples for longer times .",
    "the smooth variation of the thermodynamic integrands corresponding to steps 3 and 4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : step2ti ] ) along with small error bars throughout the integration path indicates that our system was well equilibrated and not trapped in some metastable state .",
    "the excellent overlap between the thermodynamic integrands for the forward and reverse processes also confirms the reversibility of our ti scheme .",
    "thermodynamic integrand for the last step , corresponding to switching off the flat wall.,width=288 ]    in the next step , the liquid and crystal were joined together , while the interactions of the liquid and crystal phases with the frozen walls were switched off . as fig .",
    "[ fig : step3ti ] shows , the integrands are smooth leading to an accurate numerical determination of the integral .",
    "the forward and reverse thermodynamic integrands are also in very good agreement . in the `` cleaving potential '' and `` cleaving walls '' approach",
    ", the liquid and crystal phases were first brought together and then the walls were removed . however , in our scheme these steps are combined into a single step .",
    "nevertheless , we carried out ti simulations where our single step scheme was divided into two steps : first bringing the two phases together and in the next step removing the structured walls , while varying the parameter @xmath27 in exactly the same manner as specified in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamilt_step5 ] . however , both approaches led to identical results .     density profile of the ( 100 ) orientation of the crystal in contact with the liquid and separated by a short - ranged flat wall .",
    "the temperature is @xmath1 .",
    "red vertical lines correspond to the positions of the flat walls .",
    "the system size is @xmath142.,width=288 ]     @xmath0 vs. @xmath143 , where @xmath144 , corresponding to the ( 100 ) orientation of the crystal - liquid interface with the longitudinal dimension @xmath145 .",
    "for the same parameters , the inset shows @xmath0 vs.  @xmath146 .",
    "solid symbols correspond to the @xmath0 values in the thermodynamic limit.,width=288 ]    the final step involves removing the flat walls",
    ". however , this process is no longer reversible after the barrier posed by the flat wall becomes weaker and the crystal - liquid interfaces can move .",
    "this is reflected in the hysteresis between the forward and reverse thermodynamic integrands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step4ti ] .",
    "however , the contribution of this step is negligible owing to the short - range nature of the flat walls . figure  [ fig : step4ti ] clearly shows that the area under both the forward and reverse thermodynamic integrands is much smaller , in magnitude , as compared to step 1 . as a result , one does not need to follow the `` cleaving walls '' approach of carrying out several forward and reverse simulation runs to estimate the path with the least hysteresis .",
    "in fact , for the ( 100 ) orientations of the crystal - liquid interface both forward and reverse simulations predict a magnitude less than @xmath147 for this step .",
    "this contribution will be negative since the flat wall is purely repulsive and we are removing it ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : free_eng6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : step4ti ] ) .",
    "similarly negligible contributions are obtained for the other two orientations as well .    to understand why @xmath148 would be negligible , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_step4 ] we plot the density profile corresponding to the ( 100 ) orientation of the crystal - liquid interfaces in equilibrium with their bulk phases .",
    "if the minima of the density profile coincides with the flat wall position , one will obtain a negligible contribution as in step 2 . on the other hand",
    "if a maxima coincides , the result would be larger , though due to a finite barrier imposed by the repulsive gaussian walls , the probability of a maxima in the density profile coinciding with the wall position is small .",
    "in the first step , the free energy difference per unit area was around @xmath135 ( at @xmath1 ) .",
    "since , we observe that the maxima in the density profile is about 3 times that of the bulk liquid , it is clear that the maximum possible magnitude for @xmath148 would be 3 times the contribution of @xmath149 and therefore would still be significantly smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "since the interfaces can move by simultaneous melting and freezing , the average density of the inhomogeneous system near the positions of the flat wall would be much smaller .",
    "therefore , the actual free energy difference in the last step would be much less than this maximum possible value .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in principle , one can make the gaussian flat walls as short - ranged as possible to reduce their contribution even further .",
    "however , reducing the range involves a concomitant increase in computational cost due to the need for a very short time - step in the multiple - time step scheme .",
    "a slightly more efficient way to reduce the hysteresis , would be to use a gaussian flat wall with a range long enough that one can use the regular single time - step velocity - verlet algorithm and at the same time sufficiently short - ranged , so as not to affect the bulk density of the phases .",
    "one can carry out steps 1 - 5 of the ti scheme with this flat wall , with no computational overhead involved in a multiple - time step scheme . in the next step",
    ", one can first transform this flat wall to an extremely short - ranged wall .",
    "the parametrization for this step , which we call step 6a , will be @xmath150^{2 } ) \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath27 varying from @xmath122 to @xmath153 .",
    "this step will be subject to minimal hysteresis as the flat walls are still present to prevent the particles from crossing boundaries of their simulation cells . the average position of the crystal - liquid interface would oscillate around the position of the flat walls . in the next step ( step 6b ) one can remove the flat walls with the same parametrization as in eq .",
    "we have carried out simulations by breaking step six into the two steps as specified here and obtained results in perfect agreement with the earlier method , since the flat wall chosen for our simulations was already extremely short - ranged .",
    "however , this latter approach of using an extremely short - ranged wall only in the final step , will be useful for long - ranged potentials , where the computational overhead of using a multiple time - step scheme for all the six steps might become significant .",
    "the flat gaussian walls can , in principle , be adapted to any continuous potential . only the prefactor @xmath30 , which sets the height of the barrier needs to be modified to adapt the barrier height at different temperatures .",
    "the value for the parameter @xmath31 would be suitable for most potentials , and in cases where @xmath0 has a small magnitude , the approach of breaking down step six into two steps would be also useful .    in table",
    "i , we report the final values of @xmath0 for different orientations , system sizes and temperatures . we also report data from the cleaving wall method  @xcite and a non - equilibrium work approach  @xcite .",
    "clearly , our results are in good agreement with both the methods .",
    "while @xmath0 can be computed by various molecular simulation techniques , often there is disagreement between them which is greater than the statistical errors .",
    "for example , values for the hard - sphere interfacial free energy predicted by the `` cleaving wall '' approach is more than @xmath154 less than the one computed using the capillary fluctuation method or the tethered monte carlo approach . in a recent work ,",
    "schmitz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested systematic errors arising out of finite size effects to be a possible source of disagreement between the various methods .",
    "they identified the mechanism of finite size corrections and proposed a theoretical tool to obtain reliable estimates for interfacial tensions in the thermodynamic limit .    in a three - dimensional system ,",
    "if a planar interface is described by a lateral dimension @xmath144 and a longitudinal dimension @xmath63 , the leading finite size corrections to the interfacial free energy in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath155 , are described by the following formula @xcite : @xmath156 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath157 are constants . to study the finite size corrections in our system",
    ", we carried out simulations for various lateral dimensions of the crystal - liquid interface for the ( 100 ) orientation of the crystal - liquid interface at @xmath1 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitesize ] ) , the second term is associated with the translational entropy of the interface due to movement of the crystal - liquid interface . since , the flat walls constrain the movement of the crystal - liquid interface this term is negligible in our case and can be neglected . in fig .  [ fig : gam_vs_l2inv ] , we plot the interfacial free energy for the ( 100 ) interface as a function of @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( in the inset ) , at the longitudinal system size , @xmath160 .",
    "a linear extrapolation of the data provides @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit and for the @xmath158 scaling we obtain a value of @xmath161 , while for the @xmath159 scaling a value of @xmath162 is obtained .",
    "compared to the estimated value of @xmath0 at the lateral dimension studied by davidchack and laird  @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath163 , these values are larger by about @xmath164 .",
    "we have obtained the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy for the lennard - jones potential via a novel thermodynamic integration scheme .",
    "a crucial lacunae of previous thermodynamic integration schemes pertaining to the movement of the crystal liquid interface has been overcome by the help of extremely short - ranged gaussian walls .",
    "another feature of our scheme is the use of frozen - in crystalline layers to induce ordering in the liquid and thereby merge the crystal and liquid in a smooth manner .",

    "@xcite could , in principle , be used to overcome the problem related to movement of the crystal - liquid interface . however , such schemes involve modifying the interaction potential of the entire system , yielding large free energy differences and as a result the statistical errors are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath165 itself . therefore , such schemes have to be substantially modified to compute @xmath0 .    in a recent work ,",
    "@xmath0 for the modified lj potential has been obtained using density functional theory  @xcite , with values in reasonable agreement with our data .",
    "the precise estimates for the interfacial free energy could be used to further refine and validate density functional theory approaches .    the thermodynamic integration scheme developed in this work",
