    "one of the most remarkable discoveries in galaxy evolution studies in the past years is that up to half of the most massive galaxies ( @xmath4 ) at @xmath5 are old quiescent systems with extremely compact structure , corresponding to stellar densities orders of magnitudes higher than seen in local elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "all the detected galaxies show evidence of close companions or clumpy sub - structure ( see figure [ figure.gallery ] ) . from these observations alone , it is not possible to deduce whether this is due to chance projections , ongoing minor / major mergers , or perhaps multiple star forming regions in individual galaxies , as resolved photometry and spectroscopy is not available .",
    "we note however that the two galaxies with hst / wfc3 data appear to have well separated individual components of comparable brightness , favoring the merger interpretation .",
    "this is consistent with direct observational evidence for smgs being major mergers , i.e. having multiple close components at the same redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations suggest that the timescale for major mergers are typically @xmath164 gyr @xcite .",
    "the cosmic time available between the observed epoch of the smgs at z=3 - 6 and their proposed remnants at z=2 is 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "if ( some of ) the smgs are major mergers , there is thus sufficient time available for them to coalesce to a single quiescent remnant at @xmath0 .    in the local universe",
    "most star forming galaxies are well fit by exponential disk profiles corresponding to n=1 @xcite , while irregular galaxies and ( pre - coalescence ) mergers are often best fit by models with lower n - values ( n@xmath1651 ) . at the s /",
    "n and resolution of the galaxies in the ultravista data the confidence in derived sersic parameters are limited .",
    "however , the persisting low values found for the whole @xmath138 smg sample , including the two galaxies with the higher resolution hst / wfc3 data , suggests that the galaxies are more consistent with disks or mergers than spheroids .",
    "a similar conclusion was found for a sample of 22 smgs at @xmath166 with hst / wfc3 data @xcite for which the majority were best fit by low n sersic models , with a mean @xmath167 .",
    "if @xmath138 smgs are progenitors of @xmath6 quiescent galaxies , then their evolution must include a transformation of their surface brightness profiles which increase their sersic indices , as surface brightness profiles of quiescent galaxies at @xmath130 are more centrally concentrated @xcite , e.g. the sample of k13 has @xmath168 .",
    "we discuss a possible mechanism for this transformation in section [ section.discussion ] .      combining the derived stellar masses and effective radii of the @xmath1 smgs , in figure [ figure.masssize ]",
    "we compare their stellar mass - size distribution to that of @xmath0 quiescent galaxies and of massive early type galaxies in the local universe .",
    "two of the ten nir - detected smgs are relatively extended with effective radii comparable to those in local galaxies of similar mass . both of these ( aztec 10 and aztec 15 ) appear from their nir images to be ongoing mergers .",
    "the remaining 8 galaxies are extremely compact , with @xmath169 .",
    "four are unresolved in the ultravista data .",
    "for these we adopt upper limits on their effective radii corresponding to @xmath170 .",
    "the stellar mass - size distribution of the @xmath1 smgs is similar to that of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies .",
    "both populations are smaller by an average factor of @xmath171 than local galaxies of similar mass . from the derived quantities",
    "we can infer the mean internal stellar mass surface densities within the effective radius ( @xmath172 ) of the @xmath27 smgs and @xmath0 compact quiescent galaxies ( cqgs ) which we find to be similar @xmath173 , @xmath174 more than an order of magnitude higher than in local early type galaxies of similar mass .",
    "this is consistent with a picture where the smgs passively evolve into compact quiescent galaxies after their starbursts are quenched .",
    "smgs , @xmath6 quiescent galaxies and local galaxies .",
    "the red points represent @xmath130 quiescent galaxies .",
    "black points represent @xmath121 smgs . for the latter ,",
    "the solid error bars represent the errors associated with the magphys sed fits .",
    "the dotted error bars are possible systematic errors that extend to values we derive using the @xcite templates .",
    "the grey cloud shows the mass - size distribution of massive local galaxies in the sdss survey .",
    "the mass - size distributions of smgs is similar to that of @xmath6 quiescent galaxies , significantly offset from the local relation , consistent with a direct evolutionary connection between the two populations . ]",
    "the observed space density of @xmath106 smgs is a factor of @xmath175 lower than the space density of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies ( see section [ section.numberdensities ] ) .",
    "however , the smgs only enter the sub - mm selected ( @xmath111  mjy ) sample during their intense starburst phase where they have very high star formation rates .",
    "the duration of this phase , i.e.  the duty cycle @xmath176 , which ends when the supply of gas is depleted or the star formation is quenched , e.g. by feedback from supernovae or active galactic nuclei , has been estimated to be in the range 40 - 200 myr , based on gas depletion timescales @xcite and clustering analysis @xcite .",
    "if we assume that all the @xmath129 smgs evolve into @xmath130 quiescent galaxies , and that they only undergo one smg phase we can estimate the average duty cycle of their starbursts from the observed comoving number densities of the two populations , as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the cosmic epoch corresponding to the redshift interval @xmath155 from which the @xmath129 smgs are selected . using the comoving number densities we can thus constrain the duty cycle of the smgs to @xmath179myr .",
    "this number however does not include possible systematics uncertainties on the number density of smgs discussed in section [ section.numberdensities ] . if we conservatively assume the two extreme cases where ( i ) the smg sample is 100% complete , and the field is three times overdense , and ( ii ) the sample is a factor of 1.5 incomplete but not overdense , the derived timescale are in the range @xmath180 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the timescale is thus of the order of 24  myr .",
    "therefore our constraints on the average dutycycle in @xmath129 smgs is @xmath181 , where the errors have been added in quadrature .",
    "this value is consistent with the independently estimated duty cycles based on gas depletion time scales , thus affirming the idea that @xmath129 smgs are progenitors of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies .",
    "the derived timescale does not depend strongly on the @xmath182 upper limit adopted for the smg redshift distribution .",
    "adopting limits of z=5.5 or z=7 instead , leads to timescales of 44 and 37 myr , respectively .",
    "we note that the validity of the timescale calculation presented here , relies on the assumption of a direct evolutionary connection between the two populations , implying that all @xmath0 quiescent galaxies were once @xmath27 smgs , and all @xmath27 smgs evolve into @xmath0 quiescent galaxies .",
    "we can infer a lower limit on the star formation rate of the z=2 quiescent galaxies during their formation by assuming that they started forming stars at @xmath183 and did so at a constant rate until their inferred formation redshifts .",
    "the minimum average sfr needed to acquire their observed stellar masses at z=2 calculated in this way is @xmath184 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath185 larger than the observed average sfr in star - forming lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the space density of @xmath6 quiescent galaxies with logm@xmath186/m@xmath187 , is 5 , 10 and @xmath188 times larger than that of similar mass lbgs at z=4,5 and 6 respectively @xcite .",
    "their progenitors must therefore have had much larger sfrs and are missing from lbg samples .",
    "this suggests that they must be dust obscured starburst galaxies .",
    "based on the observed line widths and compact spatial extent of molecular line emitting regions , smgs are often argued to be maximum starbursts , i.e to be forming stars at a rate close to the eddington limit . assuming a spherical symmetric geometry , an isothermal sphere density structure , a small volume filling factor for molecular gas and a chabrier imf , based on @xcite , @xcite approximate this `` maximum star formation rate '' as @xmath189}\\ ] ] where @xmath190 is the line - of - sight gas velocity dispersion in units of 400  km  s@xmath191 , @xmath192 is the opacity in units of @xmath193g@xmath191 ( usually taken to be @xmath194 , * ? ? ?",

    "the blue curves show probability distributions for a 1000 realizations of ongoing sfrs in the @xmath129 smgs , estimated from their total infrared luminosity and associated errors , through equation [ equation.sfr ] .",
    "the smgs are forming stars at high rates @xmath196 , close to the eddington limit .",
    "e.g. @xcite estimated the maximum starformation rate of aztec4 and aztec8 to be in the range @xmath197 , comparable to the values derived here ( see tab.[table.mdust ] ) .    in the following",
    "we investigate if the observed properties of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies are consistent with having formed under such conditions .",
    "assuming that @xmath130 quiescent galaxies formed in eddington limited maximum starbursts , we can estimate the maximum sfr and the duration of this burst , from the observed size , velocity dispersion and stellar mass of the quiescent remnants . in figure [ figure.eddington ]",

    "we use this mean value as measured velocity dispersions for the k13 sample are not available .",
    "there is a good general correspondence between the @xmath198 distribution of quiescent @xmath130 galaxies , and the sfr distribution of @xmath129 smgs .",
    "the @xmath198 distribution peaks at higher sfrs than the observed distribution in @xmath129 smgs , indicating that some of the @xmath6 quiescent galaxies may have formed in starbursts with sub - eddington sfrs . also plotted in figure [ figure.eddington ] ( b ) is the duration of this `` maximum starburst '' @xmath204 assuming a constant star fomation rate @xmath205 during the burst , and that all the stellar mass of the @xmath7 quiescent galaxies was created during this burst , i.e.  @xmath206 . while consistent within the errors , the mean derived timescales for eddington limited starbursts is about a factor of two longer than the starburst timescale derived from comparing comoving number densities",
    "this can be accounted for by changing some of the assumptions , e.g. , if the smg starbursts are triggered by major mergers , a fraction of the stellar mass must have been formed in the progenitor galaxies , prior to the merger . in figure [ figure.eddington ] ( c ) we show that if we assume that only half of the observed stellar mass in @xmath130 quiescent galaxies was created in a @xmath129 eddington limited starburst , i.e. @xmath207 , there is excellent agreement between the derived timescales , consistent with the idea that @xmath129 smgs are the progenitors of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies .",
    "interestingly this is consistent with the results of @xcite who found that on average @xmath208 of the stellar mass in a sample of @xmath209 smgs was formed in their ongoing starbursts .",
    "if half the stellar mass formed prior to the merger that ignite the smg starburst , an implication is that the merger progenitors must have been gas rich star forming galaxies , in agreement with the high gas fractions found in high redshift star forming galaxies @xcite          the similar mass - size distribution of the @xmath129 smgs and @xmath130 quiescent galaxies is in agreement with what one would expect if the @xmath129 smgs evolve passively into @xmath130 quiescent galaxies , after they have been quenched .",
    "prior to the quenching however the ongoing starburst will increase the stellar masses of the galaxies . in figure [ figure.deltam ]",
    "we show that the distribution of stellar masses in the @xmath129 smgs is broader than that of @xmath210 quiescent galaxies at @xmath130 .",
    "we can estimate the growth of stellar mass in the individual @xmath106 smgs from their gas masses , inferred from the fir sed fits ( see table [ table.mdust ] ) . from these",
    "we can estimate the final stellar masses of the @xmath129 smgs if we assume a star formation effeciency , i.e the fraction of gas that is turned into stars during the starburst . in the simulations of @xcite the gas fraction decrease from 45% to 40% in isolated disks and from 17.5% to 15% in merging galaxies , from the peak of the starburst to when it ends , corresponding to a decrease in gas mass of 5% and 15% during this time .",
    "if we assume that this gas is turned into stars , and that we are observing the smgs at the peak of their starburst , the models thus indicate that @xmath211 of the observed gas mass in the @xmath106 smgs will be turned in to stars during the remainder of the burst . in figure [ figure.deltam ]",
    "we compare the final stellar mass distribution of the @xmath129 smgs with that of quiescent @xmath130 quiescent galaxies , assuming that @xmath212 of the derived gas mass in the @xmath106 smgs are turned into stars before the starbursts are quenched .",
    "the two distributions are similar , with a k - s test statistic of 0.33 and a probability of 67% , in agreement with a direct evolutionary link between the two populations .",
    "the mass increase from the time the smgs are observed up to the end of the starburst will likely not significantly increase the effective radii , since the process is highly dissipative , resulting in a slight horizontal shift in the @xmath213 plane ( blue points in figure [ figure.masssize ] ) .",
    "the continued starbursts and subsequent quenching , may also provide the mechanism needed to transform the observed low - n disk - like surface brightness profiles observed in smgs to the higher n bulge - like profiles observed in quiescent galaxies at @xmath214 @xcite .",
    "most of the stellar mass will be added in the nuclear regions of the smgs , which is likely highly obscured by dust .",
    "once the quenching sets in and most of the dust is destroyed or blown away , a more centrally concentrated surface brightness distribution could be revealed .",
    "note that if , as assumed here , only 10% of the large derived gas masses in the @xmath106 smgs is turned into stars during the remainder of the burst , the following quenching mechanism must be highly effecient at heating or expelling the substantial amounts of leftover gas . a possible mechanism for expelling",
    "the gas is through outflows , driven by strong winds associsted with the maximum starbursts .",
    "tentative evidence for such outflows have recently been observed in the 163 oh line profile in an smg at z=6.3 @xcite .",
    "we stress that the large systematic uncertainties on the derived stellar masses for the smgs could potentially influence our conclusions .",

    "in this paper we presented evidence for a direct evolutionary connection between two of the most extreme galaxy types in the universe , the highest redshift ( @xmath129 ) smgs which host some of the most intense starbursts known , and quiescent galaxies at @xmath130 which host the densest conglomerations of stellar mass known .",
    "the comparison was motivated by the recent discovery of a significant population of smg at @xmath1 and high resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies which show that the majority of their stars likely formed in massive nuclear , possibly dust eshrouded starbursts in this redshift range . from a unique flux - limited statistical sample of @xmath129 smgs in the cosmos field ,",
    "we have put robust constraints on their co - moving number density , which we then put in context of the comoving number densities of quiescent galaxies of similar mass at @xmath130 . if @xmath129 smgs are progenitors of @xmath130 quiescent galaxies , then our data implies that the smg duty cycle must be @xmath181 , where the errorbars include our best estimates of the effects of cosmic variance , photometric redshift errors and incompleteness .",
    "this timescale is independent from , but in good agreement with estimates based on smg gas depletion timescales @xmath216 , estimates from hydrodynamical merger simulations @xmath217 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and estimates based on the time , compact starburst galaxies spend above the main sequence of star formation @xmath218  myr @xcite .",
    "importantly , as our estimate of the smg starburst timescale is based only on number density arguments , it is relatively independent on assumptions of the underlying stellar inital mass function ( imf ) , which is a large potential systematic uncertainty , e.g. in depletion timescale estimates .",
    "based on stellar masses derived from uv - mir photometry and sizes derived from deep nir imaging , we have shown that the mass - size distribution of the @xmath129 galaxies is remarkably similar to that observed for compact quiescent massive galaxies at @xmath130 , with similar mean internal stellar mass surface densities @xmath219 .",
    "the surface brightness distributions of the @xmath129 smgs are best fit by sersic models with low sersic n parameters , typical of local star forming disk galaxies or mergers , and the majority show multiple components or irregularities indicative of ongoing merging and/or clumpy structure .",
    "many similarities between @xmath130 quiescent galaxies and smgs exist : they have similar stellar masses , characteristic internal velocities , dynamical masses , sizes , correlation lengths etc .",
    "millimeter measurements of @xmath129 smgs in continuum and co show signatures of merging or rotation @xcite , with molecular emission line widths in the range @xmath220  km  s@xmath191 ( with a few outliers ) , and a mean @xmath221  km  s@xmath191 @xcite similar to stellar velocity dispersions @xmath222  km  s@xmath191 measured in @xmath130 quiescent galaxies .",
    "for example , for aztec 3 , at @xmath223 , @xcite measured a co linewith of @xmath224 , and a gas depletion timescale of 30  myr , similar to the smg starburst timescale derived here . at the depth and resolution of the present data , it is impossible to make strong claims about how many @xmath106 smgs are in the process of merging .",
    "however all the detected galaxies show evidence of close companions , multiple components or clumpy structure , and have low derived sersic indices , consistent with expectations for merging galaxies .",
    "in particular the two galaxies with hst / wfc3 data appears to be major mergers .",
    "the evidence presented in this paper is in support of a direct evolutionary connection between @xmath25 smgs , through compact quiescent galaxies at @xmath130 , to giant elliptical galaxies in the local universe . in this scenario ( illustrated in figure [ figure.sequence ] ) gas rich , major mergers in the early universe , trigger nuclear dust enshrouded starbursts , which on average last @xmath225 myr , followed by star formation quenching , either due to gas exhaustion , feedback from the starburst or the ignition of an agn , leaving behind compact stellar remnants to evolve passivly for about a gyr into the compact quiescent galaxies we observe at @xmath130 . over the next 10 gyr ,",
    "these then grow gradually , primarily through minor merging , into local elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite found a population of relatively massive ( log(m / m@xmath227 ) compact star forming galaxies ( csfgs ) at @xmath228 , which show evidence of quenching beginning to set - in ( lower specific star formation rates than typical star forming galaxies and increased agn fractions ) .",
    "their masses , sizes and number densities ( which increase with decreasing redshift , at the same time the number density of quiescent galaxies increase ) , suggest that the highest redshift examples of these may be progenitors of compact quiescent @xmath130 galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are thus good candidates for transition objects in the evolutionary sequence suggested here between the @xmath129 smgs and the @xmath130 quiescent galaxies .",
    "the comoving number density of the most massive csfgs ( @xmath229 ) at @xmath230 is @xmath231 , comparable to the number density for @xmath6 quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , the csfgs are not massive enough to be descendants of the brightest @xmath129 smgs , or progenitors of most of the massive @xmath130 quiescent galaxies considered here , as none of the csfgs have @xmath232 ( barro , private communication ) , but are likely decendents of less intense starbursts at @xmath129 and progenitors of slightly lower mass quiescent @xmath233 galaxies .",
    "one of the largest uncertainty in the derivables for the @xmath129 smg sample are associated with their stellar masses .",
    "as extensively discusses in @xcite stellar masses for smgs are highly dependent on the assumed star formation history , and may differ by up to @xmath137  dex given different assumptions and models .",
    "dynamical mass considerations may set an upper limit to stellar masses , however the @xmath106 smgs samples with available dynamical mass estimates are still sparse , as well as subject of their own biases .",
    "the sample of @xmath129 smgs is still small , and only partially spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "future , larger and deeper mm surveys , over multiple fields , will allow for better constraints on the evolution of the co - moving number density of starburst galaxies , to the highest redshifts , and to study the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "this will allow for more detailed tests and modeling of the proposed scenario in different redshift and mass bins , rather that in the single mass bin and two redshift ranges as possible with the present data .",
    "e.g. , the proposed scenario implies that the significant population of @xmath130 smgs should evolve into compact , @xmath15  gyr old , massive post starburst galaxies at @xmath234 .",
    "interestingly @xcite recently published a spectroscopic sample of galaxies with exactly these properties . similarly ,",
    "if compact quiescent galaxies at @xmath121 are found in the future , the properties of these should match those of the highest redshift @xmath235 smgs .",
    "with deeper data it will also be possible to push to lower star formation rates , and not only consider the most extreme starbursts . this will likely provide a way of fitting the @xmath226 csfg discussed in section [ section.csfg ] into the evolutionary picture .",
    "cosmological surface brightnes dimming and the large amounts ( and unknown distribution ) of dust in smgs make them extremely faint in the rest - frame uv and optical , and likely bias the sizes measured , even in very deep nir imaging data .",
    "however , we do note that one of the galaxy in our sample ( aztec1 ) , has been resolved in high resolution submillimeter imaging @xcite , with a derived extend of @xmath236 , corresponding to physical size of @xmath33 kpc , consistent with the constraints on the effective radius we measure from the ultravista data ( @xmath237 , see table [ table.sample ] ) .",
    "alma will greatly improve estimates of the sizes of high redshift smgs , through high resolution observations of the restframe fir dust continuum .",
    "we have argued in this paper that the observed structural properties are consistent with the smgs being disks or mergers , but the constraints are uncertain , due to the relatively low s / n and spatial resolution of the images , e.g.  the sersic n parameters and effective radii could be underestimated , due to obscuration by dust and cosmological surface brightness dimming . with alma it will be straightforward to determine redshifts from molecular lines , and constrain the internal dynamics of the galaxies , e.g.  estimate velocity dispersions , rotational velocities and",
    "search for evidence of merging .",
    "this will provide powerful diagnostics to help map the transformation of the most massive galaxies in the universe from enigmatic starburst at cosmic dawn to dead remnants , a few gigayears later .",
