    "three - body systems and processes are of fundamental interest in physics @xcite .",
    "one of these , with which a number of us have been concerned , is the recombination of three - particles to a dimer plus a free particle , in a many body system forming a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the condensate is not the lowest state of the system , but a metastable state .",
    "the 3-body recombination is the dominant mechanism for cooling and lowering the overall energy of the system .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this recombination rate depends mainly on the two - body scattering length @xmath5 @xcite , as the collision energy is low and the interaction is weak - owing to large interparticle distances , and on the bound state energies .",
    "this would suggest that zero - range potentials ( zrp ) , defined in terms of the scattering length @xcite ,    @xmath6=-1/a.\\label{i0.1}\\ ] ]    can be applied to model the interaction between the particles of the condensate .",
    "it has been shown by nielsen and macek using the hidden crossing technique that the zrp describes properly the recombination transition in a system of three @xmath3he atoms @xcite .",
    "also , gasaneo and macek showed that the zrp gives a quite good representation for the adiabatic potential of the same system @xcite . a closed form solution for a system of three - particles interacting via",
    "a zrp has been recently presented by gasaneo et al @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation process  @xmath3he@xmath7he@xmath8he@xmath9he@xmath9he was studied and relatively good agreement was found when compared with the hidden crossing calculations .    in this paper , we seek to apply our techniques to a famous model : 3 particles in one dimension , subject to pair delta - function interactions . for this model , introduced by mcguire @xcite",
    ", one can obtain exact solutions for the wave functions , the scattering matrix and the binding energies , in the case of particles of identical masses and equally weighted interactions .",
    "as such it has been extended to a larger number of particles @xcite , using bethe s ansatz @xcite , and also found to be exceedingly useful when used as a test - bed for the development of a number of different methods ( pertubative , faddeev , hyperspherical adiabatic , etc . ) @xcite .    here",
    ", we note that using zrp and ( [ i0.1 ] ) , in 3-dimensions , leads to the thomas effect and the collapse of the 3-body ground state @xcite .",
    "however , in one dimension , an equation similar to ( [ i0.1 ] ) - with @xmath5 not the scattering length - provides boundary conditions which correctly characterizes the wave functions and replace the use of the @xmath10-function interactions , and should therefore again give us exact results .",
    "one of these , though , is that the recombination rate , for this model , is exactly zero .    in section",
    "ii we propose a solution , written in integral form , for the free particle schrdinger equation , written in hyperspherical coordinates . a linear combination of free particle solutions can then be found to satisfy the boundary condition that we alluded to earlier , and thus provide us with the solution of the problem with interaction .",
    "the requirement that the wave function satisfy the boundary conditions leads us to one of the important results of this paper , namely that the weight of the free particle solutions , in the integral form , satisfies a recurrence relation similar to that obtained in the refs . @xcite and @xcite .    in section",
    "iii the method is applied to a particular case in which two of the particles are bound .",
    "it is shown that the recurrence relation , defining the coefficient of the free - particle expansion , can be solved in closed form and , thus , the scattering matrix is also obtained in a closed form .",
    "this allows us to have a detailed test of our method . in this section",
    "it is also shown that the wave function obtained is equivalent to the mcguire plane wave solution , and that our expression for the @xmath11 matrix is the matrix obtained by mcguire , in the particular case discussed in this paper . in section",
    "iv the relation between the hyperspherical adiabatic approach and the present one is discussed .    in appendix",
