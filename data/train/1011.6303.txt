    "there has been intense research interest in the _ kinetics of phase transitions _ in systems which have been rendered thermodynamically unstable by a sudden change of parameters , e.g. , temperature , pressure , magnetic field , etc .",
    "the subsequent far - from - equilibrium evolution of the system is usually nonlinear , and is characterized by complex _",
    "spatio - temporal pattern formation_. the system approaches its new equilibrium state via the emergence and growth of domains enriched in the preferred phases .",
    "this nonequilibrium dynamics is often referred to as _ phase - separation kinetics _ or _ domain growth _ or _ coarsening _ or _ phase ordering dynamics _",
    "these processes occur over a wide range of length - scales and time - scales , and are of great scientific and technological importance .    in pure ( disorder - free ) systems ,",
    "the coarsening domains are usually characterized by a divergent length scale which grows as a power - law , @xmath3 , where the exponent @xmath4 depends on the transport mechanism .",
    "for example , in the phase separation of an unstable binary mixture via diffusion , @xmath5 in the late stages of evolution .",
    "this is known as the _ lifshitz - slyozov _ ( ls ) growth law . in recent works",
    "@xcite , we have established that the ls growth law also describes the late - stage dynamics in the _ morphological phase separation _ ( mps ) of an unstable thin liquid film ( @xmath6 nm ) on a solid substrate . during mps , the film segregates into flat regions ( domains ) and high - curvature regions ( defects or hills ) . in these works ,",
    "we have also emphasized the analogies and differences between the kinetics of phase separation in binary mixtures and thin films .    of course , real experimental systems are never pure or disorder - free : they are invariably characterized by chemical and physical heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to investigate the effects of disorder on the domain growth process . for segregating @xmath7 mixtures ,",
    "coarsening is driven by interfaces between coexisting @xmath8-rich and @xmath9-rich domains .",
    "these interfaces are trapped by sites of quenched disorder , and subsequent growth occurs by thermally - activated hopping of interfaces over disorder traps @xcite .",
    "thus , domain growth is drastically slowed down in the late stages , though the domain morphology is unaffected @xcite . on the other hand , unstable liquid films undergoing mps",
    "segregate into regions with heights @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. , there are no coexisting phases . the `` interface '' between the flat phase ( @xmath10 ) and the high - curvature steepening phase ( @xmath11 ) becomes sharper as time proceeds , and is unaffected by the presence of disorder .",
    "thus , the asymptotic regime of mps with disorder is universal , and is characterized by the ls growth law @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the effect of disorder on the early stages of phase separation , i.e. , the growth of small fluctuations about a homogeneous initial state . as we discuss",

    "the early - stage dynamics is described within the framework of a linear theory , usually referred to as chc theory . in this letter , we report that growth in the chc regime is strongly amplified by the presence of disorder .",
