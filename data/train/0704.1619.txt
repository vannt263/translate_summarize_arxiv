    "as the ogle - ii proper motions are relative , in this paper we compute the proper motion dispersions of bulge stars for all field data presented by @xcite , as they are independent of the unknown proper motion zero - points .",
    "these results could aid theoretical modelling efforts for the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",

    "we describe the stellar - dynamical model of the galaxy used in this work and detail how the model was used to generate proper motion dispersions .",

    "the model is in agreement with observed ogle - ii data in the direction previously tested by @xcite . using the definition of @xcite ,",
    "the effective number of particles in the model used here is 3986 .",
    "this relatively low number results in large errors on the model proper motion dispersions and we therefore recommend regarding interpretations based on this model with some caution . an improved model with a larger number of particles ( the recent study by @xcite has an effective particle number @xmath110 ) will decrease the errors on the model predictions and allow a more useful comparison between model and observed proper motion dispersions .",
    "the ogle - ii fields mostly extend over @xmath111 in longitude and about @xmath112 in latitude across the galactic bulge region and can therefore provide a more powerful set of constraints on stellar motions predicted by galactic models .",
    "the high - accuracy proper motion data for the 45 fields and those obtained with hst @xcite can be used as direct input in the made - to - measure method to construct a better constrained dynamical model of the milky way .",
    "the statistical errors of our proper motion dispersions are small ( @xmath113 ) , but systematic uncertainties ( for example due to incorrect dust extinction treatment ) which were not included in the analysis may be significant .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that there appears to be significant difference between the observed proper motion dispersions of adjacent fields ( e.g. fields 1 and 45 ) .",
    "this might hint at some fine - scale population effect , where the kinematics of the bulge may be not in total equilibrium ( e.g. due to a small accretion event ) .",
    "higher - accuracy observations using the hst may provide further evidence of such population effects .",
    "we note that @xcite suggest the possible existence of cold structures using data from a radial velocity survey of galactic bulge m giant stars although their conclusion could be strengthened by a larger sample of stars .",
    "the ogle - ii proper motion catalogue @xcite for millions of bulge stars is still somewhat under - explored .",
    "for example , it will be interesting to explore the nature of the high proper motion stars ( @xmath114 ) and search for wide binaries in the catalogue .",
    "some exploration along these lines is under way .",
