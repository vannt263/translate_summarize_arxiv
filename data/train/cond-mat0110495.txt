    "these terms arise due to the non - markovian nature of the interaction , as a result of which the usual golden - rule replacement of @xmath143/\\omega^2 $ ] by a @xmath144-function fails at low temperature .",
    "the extra contributions are usually small compared to the golden - rule terms , but they are the leading ones when the combination of @xmath145 and @xmath146 terms cancel . these extra terms also contribute to dephasing at @xmath79 .",
    "+ * in the ground state there is no electron scattering . *",
    "this argument is based on the known properties of inelastic scattering .",
    "as long as the energy of an incident particle is lower than that of the first excited state of the scatterer , inelastic scattering is forbidden .",
    "the internal ground state wave function of the scatterer manifests itself only through a form- or debye - waller factor .",
    "one may conclude then that at low temperatures all electrons are in the ground state , therefore electron - electron scattering is suppressed and no dephasing occurs .",
    "this argument is not conclusive for several reasons .",
    "first , if one would describe electron - electron interaction in terms of inelastic scattering one should take into account that the scatterer is a macroscopic interacting many particle system with a very small spacing between the energy eigenstates .",
    "the temperatures where the experiments have been performed are much higher than this level spacing .",
    "second , since the coulomb interaction is long - range each electron interacts with many other ones .",
    "a perturbative electron - electron scattering picture is actually not appropriate .",
    "a more appropriate description is in terms of collective electron degrees of freedom , for example plasmons .",
    "also the nyquist noise description used here accounts for collective properties . within this picture",
    "all electrons form the environment for a given electron",
    ". + * quasiparticles are fully coherent .",
    "*    first we recall that the existence of exact quasiparticles is not proven , especially in disordered metal .",
    "even if well - defined quasiparticles do exist , it would not rule out dephasing of real electrons .",
    "it is the electric current of real electrons which is measured .",
    "an electron can be understood as a combination of an _ infinite _ number of coherent quasiparticles ( provided the latter can be constructed )",
    ". therefore it may be only partially coherent even at @xmath79 .",
    "a similar scenario can be analyzed rigorously in a caldeira - leggett - type model , where one ( singled - out ) oscillator is coupled to an infinite bath of oscillators .",
    "the single oscillator looses phase coherence even though the eigenmodes of the total system are fully coherent . + * during disorder averaging hikami boxes were missed . *    aag@xcite argued that careful disorder averaging within perturbation theory introduces certain contributions , the ` hikami boxes ' . according to them ,",
    "hikami boxes correspond to some paths in our approach , which we have missed .",
    "this would be responsible for the finite dephasing at @xmath79 .",
    "on one hand , we understand that hikami boxes do not correspond to any classical path .",
    "they appear as a formal feature of the perturbative many - body approach used by aag .",
    "there hikami boxes are needed to restore the causality principle . in the path integral approach causality",
    "is always maintained , and hikami boxes , together with unusual paths , do not appear at all .",
    "moreover , even within the approach of aag hikami boxes appear only in the terms generated by the action @xmath126 , which are irrelevant for dephasing .    on the other hand , within our approach the dephasing rate is found to be practically insensitive to the particular averaging procedure employed . for any given impurity configuration",
    "we find that for _ all _ time - reversed paths the term @xmath147 is positive and grows with time .",
    "thus for _ any _ pair of such paths quantum interference is suppressed by a factor @xmath148 .",
    "different procedures of averaging over these paths or the impurity configurations , e.g.  @xmath61 or @xmath62 , should yield essentially the same value of dephasing rate , possibly differing by prefactors of order one . +",
    "* the replacement @xmath149 is uncontrolled .",
    "*    in ref .",
    "it was argued that the replacement @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaint ] ) is dangerous .",
    "this replacement can be interpreted as preparation of an artificial initial state of the system .",
    "it might lead to spurious relaxation processes , which could be interpreted as dephasing at @xmath150    when analyzing this question it is important to note that we do not study the time evolution of the density matrix of an electron , rather the conductivity of the electron system .",
    "both evolve differently as can be seen from the comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ rho0 ] ) and ( [ sigma2 ] ) .",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath151 in eq.([rho0 ] ) is replaced by the combination @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma2 ] ) .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as an effective density matrix , which is strongly non - equilibrium due to the presence of the factor @xmath153 this ` non - equilibrium ' form is the main reason of relaxation and dephasing , rather than the assumption of factorized initial conditions .",
    "more generally , one observes that in dissipative systems most of the correlators of the type @xmath154 decay with time even at @xmath79 , which does not contradict to the fact that the equilibrium density matrix does not relax .    in spite of these arguments",
    ", one might still worry that the replacement @xmath149 could lead to an incorrect long - time asymptotic and wrong conclusions about the magnitude of @xmath38 .",
    "this indeed happens for certain correlators in exactly solvable models@xcite .",
    "we find , however , that it is not the case for the conductivity in the weak localization problem .",
    "we have already shown in sec .  2 that @xmath38 is not sensitive to the replacement if we can ignore the field @xmath155 .",
    "the latter can be ignored since it is responsible only for the appearence of the part @xmath126 in the action , which gives zero contribution to @xmath156 we can further add that even if we include @xmath155 , the replacement @xmath149 is justified .",
    "the reason is that the integration in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaint ] ) is confined to the region @xmath157 . in this range",
    "the effect of interactions on the density matrix is negligible because @xmath54 is much shorter than the dephasing length @xmath158 .",
    "finally , we have developed an alternative approach based on a rewriting of the exact solution ( [ solution ] ) in the form of a series . within this approach",
    "the replacements @xmath149 are not made , however the final result for @xmath38 remains unchanged .",
    "+ * high frequency modes can be ignored at @xmath79 .",
