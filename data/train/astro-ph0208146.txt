    "in many steller - mass black holes , the x - ray flux rapidly oscillates in various time - scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the short time - scale variations are generally believed to originate from the inner accretion flow onto a black hole .",
    "hence , x - ray fluctuations have received much attention for investigating the physics of the accretion flow and the black hole itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    here",
    "we report on short - term variations detected in the optical range , at which black hole binaries had been believed to be relatively calm .",
    "the object is called as v4641 sgr ( @xmath3 at quiescence ) .",
    "it forms a binary system with an orbital period of 2.8 d , containing a normal star of 58 solar - mass ( @xmath4 ) and a black hole of @xmath5 which accretes the overflowing gas from the normal star ( @xcite ) .",
    "this object first received much attention in 1999 september , when it experienced a quite luminous , but unexpectedly short outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another noteworthy feature of this system is highly relativistic jets which were associated with this outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio observations detected superluminal motion of jets with an apparent velocity of @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these features make v4641 sgr an outstanding black hole x - ray transient . the mechanisms of its outburst and highly relativistic jet are poorly understood .",
    "the next major outburst occurred in 2002 may , during which we detected rapid optical fluctuations ( @xcite ) .",
    "our ccd photometric time - series observations were performed typically with 30-cm class telescopes at kyoto , ouda , okayama , tsukuba , tiegerpoort , ellinbank , and eltham .",
    "we calculated the differential magnitude with a neighbour comparison star using ccd images which were subtracted the dark current image and performed flat fielding .",
    "the exposure times were 120 s. the unfiltered - ccd magnitude scales of each observatory were adjusted to that of the @xmath7 system obtained from @xmath7-band observations at ouda .",
    "we neglect possible small differences of variations between unfiltered ccd and @xmath7 systems since the sensitivity peak of the ccd camera is near that of the @xmath7 system and the color of the object is @xmath8 .",
    "heliocentric corrections to the observed times were applied before the following analysis .",
    "the outburst was first detected at 11.5 mag on may 19.699 ut . figure 1 shows the optical light curves of v4641 sgr during the outburst in 2002 may .",
    "figure 1a is the whole light curve during the outburst .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the object experienced repetitive brightening with amplitudes of @xmath9 and short durations of @xmath10 until may 25 .",
    "as mentioned above , we detected rapid optical fluctuations during this outburst .",
    "figure 1b shows an example of them observed around the optical peak of the 2002 outburst .",
    "we can see fluctuations of brightness with amplitudes of 0.51.5 mag and time - scales of hours in this figure .",
    "our @xmath7 and @xmath11-band simultaneous observations revealed that the amplitude of a large hump around may 24.65 is larger in @xmath11 magnitude than that in @xmath7 one .",
    "this means that the object became bluer when it reached the peak of the hump .",
    "figure 1d also shows violent fluctuations with amplitudes of about 1 mag , however the object suddenly became calm since may 25.8 .",
    "such a dramatic transition from the burst phase to the calm phase is analogous to x - ray variations observed in one of the most famous black hole binaries , the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these hours- and minutes - order fluctuations appeared in all light curves taken with our ccd time - series observations during the outburst ( may 2127 ) .",
    "the profiles of hours - order variations were apparently variable with time , as can be seen in figure 1b and 1d .",
    "the object was active even in shorter time - scales . in figure 1c , we show @xmath11-band flux variations of an order of seconds  minutes .",
    "similar fluctuations were observed even after the object faded from the outburst , as shown in figure 1e . compared with the hour - order variations ,",
    "they have smaller amplitudes of 0.10.2 mag , however the errorbars indicated in figure 1c and 1e are small enough to demonstrate that they are real variations .",
    "this observation makes the first unambiguous detection of these time - scale fluctuations in the optical flux from a black hole binary system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows power spectra of these fluctuations .",
    "the power spectra in this figure were calculated using the @xmath11-band on may 24 ( as shown in figure 1b and 1c ) and 25 . as can be seen in figure 2",
    ", the photon noise dominates at frequencies higher than 0.01 hz , however the object has significant power in lower frequencies .",
    "this demonstrates that short - term fluctuations shown in figure 1 are real variations at least , in frequencies lower than 0.01 hz , or periods longer than 100 s. the two power spectra have almost same features , while their difference is somewhat larger at the lowest frequency region .",
    "it is probably caused by daily variations of hours - scale modulations .",
    "the difference in the low - frequency region suggests that different mechanisms worked between hour - order , @xmath12 mag variations ( figure 1b and 1d ) and second  minute order , @xmath13 mag fluctuations ( figure 1c and 1e ) .",
    "the low - frequency part ( 0.00060.006 hz ) in the power spectra correspond to the latter , shorter - term fluctuations , which was described by a power law ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "our @xmath15 fitting yielded @xmath16 both in the case on may 24 and 25 .",
    "it is quite unusual that short - term and large - amplitude variations , as shown in figure 1 , were detected in the optical range which is a long wavelength region compared with the x - ray range . in general , the optical emission from black hole binaries is considered to be the thermal emission from the outer , low temperature portion of the disc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to date , ordinary black hole binary binaries sometimes showed the optical - flux variations , called `` superhumps '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "they can however be explained by modulations at the tidally - distorted outer accretion disc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we can naturally understand that variations originated from relatively low temperature region are detected in the optical range .",
    "on the other hand , the optical emission in v4641 sgr during the 2002 outburst has completely different features which were never observed in such ordinary systems .",
    "the time - scale of fluctuations is much shorter than the orbital period of v4641 sgr ( @xmath17 d ) and at the outermost part of the accretion disc .",
    "they hence indicate that the optical emission originates from the inner region of the accretion disc where the matter orbits with shorter time - scales and in high - temperature .",
    "the striking similarity to x - ray modulations in grs 1915 + 105 also reminds us of inner , short - time scale events .",
    "another noteworthy feature during the 2002 outburst of v4641 sgr is an extremely small x - ray / optical flux ratio .",
    "observations with rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) revealed that the object was active also in x - ray during the optical outburst and reached a peak of about 60 mcrab on may 24.55http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov / users / swank / v4641sgr/@xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray / optical flux ratio of v4641 sgr is calculated to be an order of 1 , although those of typical systems are @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a small x - ray / optical flux ratio means a peculiar energy spectrum in the x - ray  optical range , in which the optical emission is exceptionally high .",
    "the extremely small x - ray / optical flux ratio indicates weak contribution of thermal emission from an optically - thick disc . instead of thermal disc emission , the synchrotron emission might be acceptable for a dominant source of the optical emission . during the outburst ,",
    "the inverted spectrum was reported by radio observations , which strongly indicates a strong contribution from synchrotron emission in the radio range.http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rsault/astro/v4641/@xmath18http://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/mail/vsnet-campaign-v4641sgr/msg00051.html@xmath18 it is possible that that the strong synchrotron emission dominates even in the infrared  optical range . under magnetic fields @xmath20@xmath21 g ,",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the synchrotron emission from accretion discs can be its maximum at the optical range , and furthermore , simulated energy spectra can yield extremely small x - ray / optical ratio ( 110 ) , as in v4641 sgr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed colours also support a significant contribution of synchrotron emission at the optical range .",
    "our multi - colour photometry on may 24 yielded de - reddened colours of the highly variable component of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 assumed ; @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the colour of @xmath26 is exceptionally red compared with the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the @xmath29-band flux is considerably in excess of that expected from the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 .",
    "such a energy spectrum can not be explained only with thermal disc emission .",
    "the synchrotron emission can be a strong candidate to reconcile these colours .",
    "the above scenario can moreover provide a consistent picture for short - term fluctuations .",
    "the paradigm of cyclo - synchrotron emission from magnetic flares has been recently discussed for a strong candidate of short - term fluctuations in the black hole binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "various scales of magnetic flares in accretion discs can produce various scales of flux variations of the cyclo - synchrotron emission .",
    "the fluctuations from such flares are reported to produce power spectra with a power law of @xmath30 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is acceptable for @xmath31 observed in x - ray emission from ordinary black hole binaries ( @xmath32@xmath33 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and also , in optical emission from v4641 sgr .",
    "the cyclo - synchrotron emission mentioned above is thus the most promising interpretation of the optical seconds  minutes order fluctuations in v4641 sgr .",
    "while radio observations showed no evidence of short - term fluctuations , http://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / mail / alert7000/msg00351.html@xmath18 it can be naturally understand by considering emission sources different from the optical one , for example , ejected clouds or optically - thick post - shock jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the synchrotron emission from jets is also a possible source of the rapid optical variations although no evidence of jets has been reported during the outburst in 2002 may ( @xcite ) .",
    "v4641 sgr is proposed to be a `` microblazar '' rather than a `` microquasar '' since the jets observed during the 1999 outburst have been proposed to have a largest bulk lorentz factor of @xmath34 among known galactic sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the large @xmath35 is caused by a low inclination of the system , the rapid , large - amplitude fluctuations in the 2002 may outburst may be explained with the doppler boosting in the jets . in this case , however , the lack of radio short - term fluctuations may be a more serious problem since we may need another synchrotron source which should be steady and dominant at the radio range .",
    "a noteworthy advantage of v4641 sgr is its apparent brightness ( @xmath36 ) which we can easily observe even with small telescopes , compared with the other objects , for example , grs 1915 + 105 ( @xmath37 ) and xte j1118 + 480 ( @xmath38@xmath39 ) . in a number of black hole binaries , the optical  uv flux",
    "is heavily obscured by intersteller extinction .",
    "on the other hand , it can be the most essential wavelength when the synchrotron emission is dominant because its peak frequency can lie at the optical range ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "v4641 sgr is a unique object which shows fluctuations caused by the magnetic activity detected in the optical range . in future , simultaneous observations from x - ray to radio",
    "will been performed and enable us to study the short - term fluctuations in multi - wavelengths .",
    "our discovery of these new features of v4641 sgr will thus lead a revolutionary advance in our understanding of the magnetic activity in black hole accretion discs .    we are pleased to acknowledge comments by t. kawaguchi .",
    "we are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual ccd estimates via vsnet .",
