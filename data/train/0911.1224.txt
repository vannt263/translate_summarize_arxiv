    "indeed @xmath123 then by the change of coordinates @xmath124 equation @xmath125 is equivalent to @xmath126 .",
    "we begin with the observation that the critical surface @xmath75 as defined by equation is a ruled surface . to see this ,",

    "[ lem : globuse ] the open parts @xmath163 and @xmath166 form a topological 2-sphere @xmath173 enclosing the open topological 3-disc @xmath174 , similarly for the pairs @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 enclosing @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the incidence diagram can almost immediately be read off from the domains of @xmath134 in figure [ fig : incid ] . for the sake of simplicity we use the same names for the strata in the domains as their images .",

    "points where @xmath134 is not one - to - one are indicated in figure [ fig : domain ] .    from the incidence diagram",
    "we infer that the points @xmath100 and the lines @xmath181 are not essential for the global structure of @xmath75 . therefore the lines indicating their relation with other strata are dashed . indeed ,",
    "since @xmath168 is a smooth interval in the domain of @xmath182 , so is its image .",
    "thus @xmath183 is a smooth curve with endpoints @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( or to be formally correct @xmath186 and @xmath187 ) .",
    "this means we may shrink the lengths of @xmath188 and @xmath189 to zero without changing the global structure . similarly for @xmath169 .",
    "now we turn to @xmath170 . from the domain of @xmath182",
    "we see that @xmath163 and @xmath164 restricted to @xmath190 are smoothly attached along the lines @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "therefore they form a 2-disc in @xmath190 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath163 and @xmath164 restricted to @xmath190 is a great circle , namely the image of the dashed line with four arrows in figure [ fig : domain ] .",
    "this great circle is shown in figure [ fig : conoid ] .",
    "similarly the restriction of @xmath163 and @xmath164 to @xmath193 is also a 2-disc with the same boundary .",
    "these 2-discs are glued smoothly along their common boundary thus forming a 2-sphere .",
    "it is only a topological 2-sphere because there is a singular interval on each 2-disc .",
    "the same holds for @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "looking again at the domains of @xmath134 in figure [ fig : domain ] we infer that @xmath167 is a smooth closed curve in @xmath75 .",

    "the intersections of @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 with the boundary of @xmath190 , and of @xmath193 , consist of two transversally intersecting great circles .",
    "thus we see for example that @xmath164 and @xmath165 are both on the same side , let us agree that they are on the _ outside _ , of the topological @xmath195-sphere @xmath173",

    "the third step consists of switching to the homogeneous reduced unfolding @xmath51 .",
    "the results of the previous section show that for @xmath37 , a condition which is fulfilled in a small neighborhood of @xmath3 , the eigenvalue configurations are constant along rays @xmath201 , with @xmath70 and @xmath202 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath203 depends on @xmath57 . in view of remark [ rem : nu5 ]",
    "we may assume that @xmath57 is large enough so that we may take @xmath204 .",
    "then we use homogeneity of eigenvalue configurations to restrict to the @xmath10-sphere @xmath205 .",
    "thus we left with a three dimensional problem .",
    "for the latter we have a whitney stratification @xmath206 with increasing dimension , see figure [ fig : incid ] . on each of these strata",
    "the eigenvalue configuration is constant . by choosing representative points and computing the eigenvalues we get table [ tab : eigconfs ] . from this table",

    "the boundary of the stability domain can be read off from the incidence diagram in figure [ fig : incid ] , it consists of the components @xmath207 .",
    "that is , the topological @xmath195-discs @xmath164 and @xmath165 and moreover all singular lines and points , see figure [ fig : conoid ] .",
    "all that remains is to prove that table [ tab : eigconfs ] is correct .",
    "the eigenvalue configurations follow from direct computation .",
