    "absence of a mobility edge in 1d disordered systems with short - range correlations is well established @xcite . despite the fact that this statement is proved only for short - range correlated systems , the occurrence of a mobility edge in 1d random system with some particular long - range correlated disorder , reported in @xcite , seems to be very interesting and unexpected .",
    "the authors of @xcite have managed to construct the correlated random potential for which the inverse localisation length ( calculated theoretically for small degrees of disorder ) was found to be zero for the central half - band of the energy spectrum and to be a non - zero constant for the remaining half - band . from the author s of this note point of view , the infinitiness of localisation length is not an unambiguous criterium of localisation .",
    "for example , the zero - state in 1d chain with off - diagonal disorder has infinite localisation length @xcite but , nevertheless , zero - state was found to be localised in sense of the basic anderson criterium of localisation @xcite .",
    "therefore the verification of the result obtained in @xcite by means of anderson ( or equivalent ) criterium of localisation is necessary .",
    "the main task of this note is to put forward the additional arguments in favor of presence of a mobility edge in correlated 1d random chain , constructed by recipe @xcite . to do this",
    "we perform the numerical exploration of eigen vectors of the random matrix of an appropriate disordered hamiltonian by means of a criterium of localisation , differing from the _ finiteness of the localisation length_.",
    "the matrix of the hamiltonian we are going to study has the tight - binding form @xmath0 with _ long - range correlated _ random potential @xmath1 , generated in accordance with the following algorithm @xcite : @xmath2 \\label{00}\\ ] ] w here @xmath3 are similarly destributed independent random numbers with @xmath4 and @xmath5 for any integer @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the degree of disorder is controlled by @xmath7 . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the spectral dependence of the inverse localisation length calculated for the hamiltonian ( [ 0 ] ) with random potential ( [ 00 ] ) at small degree of disorder @xmath7 , goes down to zero in the central half - band @xmath8 $ ] and remains constant at @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the authors of @xcite have interpreted this as the occurrence of a mobility edges at @xmath10 .",
    "below we verify this statement from the view point of our criterium of localisation , which is equivalent to the anderson s criterium .",
    "we will start from reminding of a simple criterium of localisation , suggested in @xcite , which we will use below .",
    "we will characterise an arbitrary state @xmath11 by a _",
    "number @xmath12 of sites , covered by an appropriate wave function @xmath13 , _ calculated as follows .",
    "as @xmath13 is the eigen vector of a random hamiltonian matrix in site representation , @xmath13 represents a vector - cloumn with componets @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the site index . if @xmath16 at a certain site @xmath15 , then this site is _ not covered _ by a state @xmath11 and is not taken into account while calculating @xmath12 .",
    "vice versa , if @xmath17 reaches its maximum @xmath18 at the site @xmath15 , then this site is _ covered completely _ and its contribution while calculating @xmath19 is equal to unit . in the general case ,",
    "the contribution of an arbitrary site @xmath15 is equal to @xmath20 and we obtain the following formula for @xmath21 : @xmath22 we can now introduce energy depending @xmath23 as follows .",
    "let us specify some energy interval @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a typical range of eigen energies for the random hamiltonian under consideration .",
    "consider all states with energies within the interval @xmath26 $ ] and denote by @xmath27 the summation over all these states .",
    "now calculate @xmath23 as the following average value over all states with energies within the interval @xmath26 $ ] : @xmath28 with @xmath29 standing for the averaging over realisations of disorder .",
    "for small enough @xmath30 the function ( [ 2 ] ) does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "for the hamiltonian represented by a random matrix of size @xmath31 , the function @xmath32 in the spectral range of localised states should not depend on @xmath31 ( if @xmath31 is large enough for @xmath33 in this spectral region ) . in the spectral range of delocalised states (",
    "if it is exist ) , the function @xmath32 must increase as @xmath34 .",
    "this property of @xmath35 one can use as a criterium for selection of localised and delocalised states in numerical experiments .",
    "for various sizes @xmath36 of a random hamiltonian matrix ( [ 0 ] ) at variuos degrees of disorder @xmath37 .",
    "the matrix size @xmath31 and the degree of disorder @xmath7 are shown at the panels . in all cases",
    "the averaging over 100 realisations was performed , @xmath38 .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the realisation of a random potential ( [ 00 ] ) . ]    in our calculations the auxiliary random values @xmath3 were of gauss type with the distribution function in the form @xmath39 the spectral dependences of @xmath40 for various sizes @xmath36 of a random hamiltonian matrix ( [ 0 ] ) at variuos degrees of disorder @xmath37 are presented at fig.[fig1 ] . from fig.[fig1]a",
    "one can see that , at small disorder @xmath41 , the well - pronounced signs of delocalised states in the central half - band @xmath8 $ ] are observed . in this spectral range",
    "the number @xmath40 of sites covered by the wave functions is proportional to the size @xmath31 of a random matrix ( [ 0 ] ) . at @xmath42 $ ]",
    "the number @xmath35 does not depend on @xmath31 . as it was mentioned above",
    ", such a behaviour corresponds to the localised character of states at @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "so , the signs of a mobility edge at @xmath10 , predicted in @xcite , are observed .",
    "despite the fact that the above data have confirmed the statements of @xcite there are at least two questions remain to be answered .",
    "the first question can be formulated as follows . in accordance with @xcite the localisation length @xmath43 of states with energies in the range @xmath42 $ ]",
    "_ must be constant_. but our calculations show that the number of sites @xmath35 covered by the localised wave functions is strongly depend on energy in this energy interval ( fig.[fig1]a ) , varying from 7  8 ( nearly zero ) at @xmath44 to @xmath45 at the \" mobility edge  @xmath10 .",
    "it seems strange because both these quantities ( @xmath35 and @xmath43 ) must describe the size of localised states and their energy dependence must be similar @xmath46 . in our opinion",
    "this inconsistency reveals the ambiguous and disputable character of the localisation length as a measure of localisation of states .",
    "the second question relates to the behaviour of the above random model at large degrees of disorder .",
    "the existence of a mobility edge ( in the sense of inverse localisation length ) was obtained in @xcite in the limit of small disorder @xmath47 . whether it is possible to extend this result for the case of an arbitrary strong disorder ? to clear up this we have studied the behaviour of @xmath35 at large degrees of disorder .",
    "the results are presented at fig.[fig1 ] ( b , c ) .",
    "one can see that fig.[fig1 ] ( b , c ) give grounds to conclude that at large disorder _ all states of the system are localised _ : the number of covered sites @xmath35 for the states at the center of the band saturate , i.e. the nearly linear dependence @xmath35 on @xmath31 , which takes place for @xmath41 ( fig.[fig1]a ) , violates . having this in mind",
    ", one can suppose that if we had an opportunity to make calculations for @xmath41 ( fig.[fig1]a ) with matrixes of the size greater than 4000 , we would also observe the saturation of linear dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath31 . or there is some critical degree of disorder @xmath48 , such that for @xmath49 , the states in the center of the band become localised ?      even if the further exploration of the correlated random system ( [ 0 ] ) , ( [ 00 ] ) will disprove the existence of exact mobility edge in this system , the curious spectral dependence of a number of covered sites @xmath35 with a \" mobility edge ",
