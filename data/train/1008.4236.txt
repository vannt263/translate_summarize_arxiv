    "the @xmath5-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath5cdm ) model has been consistent with observational data , but the energy scale of dark energy is too low to be compatible with the cosmological constant originated from the vacuum energy in quantum field theory @xcite . since the observations allow the variation of the dark energy equation of state @xcite , many models have been proposed to explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . for example , a light scalar field with a slowly varying potential , called quintessence , was introduced as an alternative to the cosmological constant @xcite . in general , however , it is not easy to construct viable particle physics models of quintessence because of an extremely light mass required for the cosmic acceleration today @xcite .",
    "another approach for addressing the dark energy problem is to modify the law of gravity from general relativity at large distances @xcite . in this approach",
    "there have been two main streams .",
    "the first consists of introducing a lagrangian for gravity built up out of the ricci , riemann , and metric tensors , which generally leads to 4-th order differential equations .",
    "the @xmath6 gravity @xcite and the gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite belong to this class .",
    "the second consists of higher dimensional models that realize the cosmic acceleration through the gravitational leakage to extra dimensions .",
    "the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model",
    "@xcite belongs to this class ( see refs .",
    ".    in general , modified gravity models of dark energy need to be constructed to recover the general relativistic behavior in the regions of high density for the consistency with local gravity experiments . in @xmath6 gravity ,",
    "there have been a number of viable models in which a scalar - field degree of freedom ( `` scalaron '' @xcite ) has a large mass in the region where the ricci scalar @xmath4 is much larger than its cosmological value @xmath7 today @xcite .",
    "provided that the chameleon mechanism @xcite is at work in the local regime , the gravitational coupling with non - relativistic matter can be suppressed to be compatible with solar system experiments @xcite .",
    "there is also another mechanism called the vainshtein screen effect @xcite in which non - linear effects can effectively decouple the scalar field from gravity .",
    "originally the vainshtein mechanism was applied to the theories of massive gravity like fierz - pauli gravity @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but the non - linearities imply the presence of a ghost state in such theories @xcite .    in the dgp model",
    "non - linear field self - interacting lagrangians such as @xmath8 arise from a brane - bending mode ( i.e. a longitudinal graviton ) @xcite .",
    "this allows the decoupling of @xmath0 from gravitational dynamics in the local region .",
    "unfortunately the self - accelerating solution in the dgp model contains a ghost mode @xcite even in the absence of non - linear terms .",
    "moreover the model is disfavored from the combined data analysis of supernovae ia and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite .    mostly inspired by the dgp model , nicolis _ et al .",
    "@xcite derived the five lagrangians that lead to the field equations invariant under the galilean symmetry @xmath9 in the minkowski space - time [ including the term @xmath8 ] .",
    "the scalar field that respects the galilean symmetry is dubbed `` galileon '' .",
    "each of the five terms only leads to second - order differential equations , keeping the theory free from unstable spin-2 ghost degrees of freedom . if we extend the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite to the curved space - time , the lagrangians need to be promoted to the covariant forms .",
    "@xcite derived the covariant lagrangians @xmath11 ( @xmath2 ) that keep the field equations up to second - order .",
    "we caution that in the curved space - time the galilean symmetry is in general broken for non - linear field self - interacting terms , but in the minkowski space - time it is preserved for the covariant lagrangians @xmath11",
    "( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the ( modified ) galileon gravity has been extensively applied to cosmology recently @xcite .",
    "one application is to introduce the non - linear field self - interaction of the form @xmath12 in the action of ( generalized ) brans - dicke theories @xcite , where @xmath13 is a function of @xmath0 .",
    "although such a term breaks the galilean symmetry , the field equations remain at second - order . moreover ,",
    "for suitable choices of the function @xmath14 , there exist de sitter ( ds ) solutions responsible for dark energy even in the absence of the field potential .",
    "the presence of the non - linear term also allows the decoupling of the field from gravity in the regions of high density under the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "another application of galileon gravity to cosmology is to study the expansion history of the universe in the presence of the covariant lagrangians @xmath11 ( @xmath2 ) mentioned above .",
    "the cosmology up to the term @xmath15 has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed the existence of stable ds solutions .",
    "recently the full cosmological dynamics including the term @xmath16 have been studied in ref .",
    "the viable model parameter space has been found by studying the conditions for the avoidance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities .",
    "interestingly there exists a tracker solution that finally approaches a stable ds solution .",
    "the equation of state of dark energy exhibits a peculiar phantom - like behavior along the tracker .    in this paper we shall study general galileon theories in which the field @xmath0 in the covariant lagrangians @xmath11 ( @xmath2 )",
    "is replaced by general functions @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 are scalar functions , the resulting field equations also remain at second - order .",
    "we constrain the forms of @xmath1 from the requirement to obtain ds solutions .",
    "this constraint gives rise to the galileon theory with @xmath17 as a specific case .",
    "for general functions @xmath1 we also derive the conditions for the avoidance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities .",
    "this is useful to constrain the viable parameter space of those theories",
    ". we shall perform detailed analytic and numerical study for the cosmological dynamics of generalized galileon theory with several different choices of @xmath1 .",
    "in the curved space - time the galilean symmetry is broken even for the lagrangian @xmath18 .",
    "then this symmetry is not restrictive when we study the covariant generalization of the galileon field . on the other hand",
    ", the covariant galileon formalism leads to second - order field equations .",
    "we study a lagrangian that gives second - order equations of motion , such that the theories recover the covariant lagrangian in refs .",
    "@xcite as a specific case .",
    "we will consider two generalizations of the covariant galileon theory : ( i ) scalar couplings with both the ricci scalar @xmath4 and the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term @xmath19 are introduced , ( ii ) the covariant galileon terms are extended to more general functions .",
    "as for the first point , this step is compatible with the approach of field theory , because such scalar couplings generally exist and they are consistent with general covariance ( and even with the galileon symmetry , as in the minkowski background their contributions to the equations of motion of the field identically vanish ) . moreover the scalar couplings with @xmath4 and @xmath19",
    "give only second - order contributions .",
    "it is true that the gb term can change the ultra - violet behavior for the modes , but this property also holds for all the remaining terms coming from the extended galileon action .    as for the second point",

    "<S> the former corresponds to the covariant galileon theory that respects the galilean symmetry in the minkowski space - time . for generalized galileon theories </S>",
    "<S> we derive the conditions for the avoidance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities associated with scalar and tensor perturbations as well as the condition for the stability of de sitter solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out detailed analytic and numerical study for the cosmological dynamics in those theories . </S>"
