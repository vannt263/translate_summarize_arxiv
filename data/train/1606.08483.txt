    "interaction between light and matter described by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is the most fundamental force , and at the same time it represents the simplest illustration of the power of quantum theory ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the computational complexity is the main obstacle , which arises in the application of qed to the practically valuable problems , hence the important role play the finite dimension models of qed where the complex states of electromagnetic field can be reduced to few qubits , which means the presence of absence of a photon of the certain mode in the limited area of space - time .",
    "the main such model was proposed by jaynes and cummings for the two - level atom in fabry ",
    "prot optical resonator @xcite , and was then generalized to ensembles of such atoms ( model of tavis - cummings or dick - see @xcite ) and to the several resonators connected by optical fiber ( model of jaynes - cumming - hubbard - see @xcite ) . in the framework of these models and their numerous variations the important for applications effects can be described , such as dat ( dephasing assisted transport - @xcite,@xcite ) . on the basement of the finite dimension models of qed",
    "the simple form of nonlinear optical effects can be also represented , which in principle permit to build the elementary gates for quantum computations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "jch model generalizes the so called continuous quantum walks ( @xcite ) and can be used for its practical realization .    in this work",
    "we study the property of atonic ensembles in the optical cavity to accumulate energy in the form of atomic excitations .",
    "it is known that the special states of atoms having relatively large energy can persist for a long time without photon emission .",
    "there are the so called dark states .",
    "it is possible to extract the energy in the form of photons from the atomic ensemble in dark state - by the spatial separaton of atoms , by the dephasing noise or the similar differentiated impact on atoms .",
    "the resonator is needed only for the creation of a dark state , the atomic system can be then removed from the cavity and it continues to be dark provided we keep atoms together ( for example , by the optical tweezers ) .",
    "dark states have numerous applications .",
    "in particular , its role in the organization of the inter - atomic interaction is considered in the work @xcite , in the control of solid state spins - in the work @xcite , for the control on the macroscopic quantum systems - in the work @xcite , one of the effects of darkness in the photo synthesis - in the work @xcite .",
    "some methods of the dark states fabrication in quantum dots can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the destruction of dark states by magnetic field or by the modulated laser polarization is considered in the work @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is the explicit description of dark states for an ensemble of two level atoms .",
    "it follows from their definition that they form the subspace , we call it dark subspace",
    ". we are interested in the structure of this subspace and its dimensionality .",
    "hitherto the most complete description of dark states in a system of qudits ( @xmath0- level systems ) has been represented in the work @xcite . in particular , for two level atoms it was proved in @xcite that dark states are exactly stationary points of tensor degree of the group @xmath1 .",
    "these stationary points are called in that work singlet states , because two atom singlets of epr form @xmath2 are invariant of this group .",
    "now we will prove , that singlet states can be represented as a linear combinations of simple singlets , that is tensor products of epr pairs .",
    "this fact justifies the term  singlet  , which has a chemical origin : singlet states of electronic spins are binding for atoms that is they allow forming of the covalent bond .",
    "we consider the model of tavis - cummings consisting of the optical cavity - resonator , and the group of identical two - level atoms inside .",
    "we assume that atoms are distinguishable and do not apply to their wave function bosonic or fermionic symmetrization .",
    "the length of the cavity @xmath3 equals the half of wave length of a photon with the frequency @xmath4 , which differ from the frequency of atomic transition @xmath5 by the small detuning @xmath6 .",
    "the small detuning ensures the constructive interference of electrical field induced by photons inside the cavity and the large lifetime of photons with frequency @xmath4 in it .    in this case we can write the hamiltonian of interaction between atoms and photons inside the cavity in the dipole approximation in the from of tavis - cummings : @xmath7 where the force of interaction of one atom @xmath8 with the field is @xmath9 , @xmath10 - the distribution of the photon electric field strength along the axis of resonator",
    ", @xmath11 - is the coordinate of the @xmath8-th atom along this axis , @xmath12 is the effective volume of the cavity , @xmath0 is the dipole momentum of an atom , @xmath13 is the electrical constant .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the detuning @xmath14 is zero .",
    "the frequency and the force of interaction are always nonzero .",
    "we denote the part of interaction in hamiltonian of the form @xmath15 by @xmath16 , and the other part of interaction @xmath17 - by @xmath18 .    in the case of weak interaction",
    "@xmath19 we can keep only summands @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which separately conserve energy that is @xmath16 and discard two others that do not conserve energy separately , that is @xmath18 ; so we obtain the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .    a state , which can emit the photon we call bright . not bright state we call dark .",
    "a state , which can not absorb the photon we call transparent .",
    "a transparent and dark state is called invisible . in the other words : an invisible state of the atomic ensemble is a state , in which this ensemble can neither emit , nor absorb the photon . by @xmath22",
    "we denote the ground and excited states of an atom . in rwa approximation",
    ", the example of dark two - atom state can be : @xmath23 , the example of transparent : @xmath24 .",

    "the states @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dark and transparence correspondingly only when this approximation is applicable . if we refuse from rwa , these states loose these properties .",
    "say , the state @xmath25 becomes bright , if hamiltonian has the form , because it can transit to the state with one photon @xmath27 , where the lower index @xmath28 denotes fock state of the field .",
    "we consider the example of two - qubit states in rwa approximation .",
    "let at first the forces of interaction of each atoms be equal : @xmath29 .",
    "we choose as a new basis triplet and singlet states of the form @xmath30 , @xmath31 . from them",
    "only singlet @xmath32 is invisible , whereas the triplet @xmath33 is neither dark , nor transparent .",
    "let us suppose now that @xmath34 , for example , atoms occupy the different positions in the cavity .",
    "the dark state will be then @xmath35 ( we enumerate atoms from left to right ) . in what follows",
    "we assume that the force of interaction is the same for all atoms .",
    "the weight ( hamming ) @xmath36 of the basic state @xmath37 is the total number of units in it .",
    "basic state of atoms @xmath37 we call equilibrium basic state , if its weight equals the half of total number of atoms .",
    "equilibrium basic states thus exist only for ensembles with even number of atoms . a superposition of equilibrium basic states is called an equilibrium state of atoms .",
    "the more general property of atomic states is the linearity .",
    "an atomic state @xmath38 is called linear if all its basic components have the same weight .",
    "we will see that the property of invisivility does not depend on the applicability of rwa , in particular , all invisible states are equilibrium .",

    "we identify a natural number @xmath8 with the string of ones and zeroes forming its binary expansion .",

    "if a state is dark for the exact hamiltonian , we can smoothly change the constant of interaction with the light @xmath75 , launching it to zero and obtain that this state is dark for rwa hamiltonian as well .",

    "the spatial separation of atoms in dark ensemble or the thermal dephasing immediately leads to the emission of photons .",
    "dark states have numerous applications , for example , they can be used for the defence of qubits in quantum computations , as the energetic reservoir for lasers , etc .",
    "we have established the exact dimension of the dark states subspace and its structure : dark states are linear combinations of simple singlets , each of which is the tensor product of antisymmetric epr - pairs .",
    "the search for the further applications of dark states and the ways of their fabrication represent the task for the further investigations .",
    "we have also represented the almost dark states , which are linear combinations of triplets ; they weakly interact with the light when the excitation energy of atoms is small that can be realised , for example , for rydberg states .",
    "the explicit description of almost dark states as well as the dark states in the systems of qudits for @xmath201 represents the separate problems .",
