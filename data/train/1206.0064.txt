    "correlations of physical properties between states provide the cleanest differentiation between quantum descriptions and classical ones . by quantum descriptions",
    "we mean those in which entangled states have correlations that can not be reproduced by ascribing to the physical properties distinctive and unchanging values . by classical descriptions",
    "we mean those wherein such assignments are explicit , or through hidden variables .",
    "the best known of this distinction is encoded in the super - classical descriptions of spins in canonical quantum mechanics ( qm ) , as exemplified by the celebrated bell s inequalities @xcite .    in the formulation by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) @xcite ,",
    "the observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , associated with the spins of two spacelike separated particles and the subscripts indicating detector settings , are assumed to yield either one of the two numbers @xmath4 upon measurement .",
    "the combination of correlators given by @xmath5 can be shown to have its absolute value bounded by 2 for classical hidden variable theory , that is : @xmath6 for arbitrary pairs of detector settings .",
    "this inequality is violated by correlations in canonical qm in which the upper bound is replaced by @xmath7 @xcite . in the present context , by canonical qm",
    "we mean a description based upon a hilbert space defined over the complex number field .",
    "observables have correspondence with hermitian operators on the space , which do not necessarily commute with each other .    however , we demonstrate in @xcite that canonical qm is not a unique quantum description . there ,",
    "variants of canonical qm are constructed on vector spaces over the finite galois field @xmath0 .",
    "both canonical qm and our variant quantum description make crucial use of the underlying linear properties , and the chsh bound for both is predicated upon properties of the vector space . in @xcite we point out the importance of the inner product in deriving the conventional chsh bound .",
    "the vector spaces on which our variants are constructed do not support an inner product because of the cyclicity of galois fields .",
    "consequently , the chsh bound of our variant differs from the canonical value : we find that it is 2 , the classical hidden variable value .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the resultant range of correlations also can not be reproduced in any classical context with hidden variables @xcite .",
    "the system is therefore quantum in the sense described above , despite the chsh bound remaining at 2 .",
    "the use of galois fields in physics is not extensive @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we elaborate on our model presented in @xcite to better provide an intuitive feel for how the properties of galois fields are utilized .",
    "details of implementation using concrete examples are presented , as well as the full derivation of the chsh bound for ` spin ' systems .",
    "our model system for ` spin ' has much similarity with canonical spin in conventional 3d space .",
    "we describe the extent to which our ` spin ' can be mapped to ordinary spin , and the associated finite projective geometry and projective group to 3d space rotations .",
    "this relationship is demonstrated via transformations on the associated polyhedron .",
    "the emergent geometry provides a useful framework to visualize the underlying physics of the approach . in general , the role of @xmath8 familiar in descriptions of spin - like @xmath9-level systems in conventional qm is now replaced by @xmath10 , the projective linear group acting on the vector space over galois fields of order @xmath11 .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review our construction of galois field quantum mechanics ( gqm ) .",
    "section iii presents a detailed analysis of the @xmath12 case .",
    "we pay particular attention to the chsh bound , and the impossibility of hidden variables to account for this result .",
    "we also present the analogs of singlet and triplet states under @xmath13 in conventional qm in the present formulation , and how these account for the resultant bound .",
    "section iv is devoted to the discussion of the geometric structure of ` rotations ' in the contexts of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 fields .",
    "we explicitly construct and identify some of the transformations with those of some polyhedral group , for the case of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , thereby justifying the spin - like context for these levels . in the concluding section",
    ", we comment on how these results can impact upon more general foundational questions in quantum theory .",
    "before we proceed , we emphasize that our model is distinct from ` galois quantum systems ' discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "these papers consider a phase space which is assumed to be @xmath22 ; that is , the position and momentum of particles take values in @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", it is the wave - functions that take values in @xmath23^n$ ] , while the outcomes of measurements take on values in @xmath24 , the real number line .",
    "the key variation introduced in @xcite is the replacement of the hilbert space of an @xmath9-level quantum system , @xmath25 , with a discrete vector space over a finite field : @xmath26 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the galois field @xmath0 , where @xmath28 with @xmath29 prime and @xmath30 . for the @xmath31 case , @xmath32 is simply @xmath33 .",
    "the states of the system are represented by vectors @xmath34 , and outcomes of measurements by dual - vectors @xmath35 .",
    "observables are associated with a choice of basis of @xmath36 , each dual - vector in it representing a different outcome .",
    "the probability of obtaining the outcome represented by @xmath37 when a measurement of the observable is performed on the state represented by @xmath38 is given by the canonical form @xmath39 where the bracket @xmath40 is converted into a non - negative real number @xmath41 via the absolute value function : @xmath42 here , underlined numbers and symbols represent elements of @xmath27 , to distinguish them from elements of @xmath24 or @xmath43 .",
    "note that all non - zero elements of @xmath27 are assigned an absolute value of 1 , effectively making them all ` phases . '",
    "definition is not arbitrary . in order that the absolute value function generate probability amplitudes for multi - particle states ,",
    "we must ensure , for consistency , that it satisfies the critical factorizability criterion for product states . since @xmath44 is a cyclic multiplicative group ,",
    "this definition of absolute value is the only one consistent with the requirement @xmath45 which is necessary for the probabilities of product states to factorize .",
    "since the multiplication of @xmath38 with a non - zero element of @xmath27 will not affect the probability as defined above , vectors that differ by a non - zero multiplicative constant are identified as representing the same physical state , and the state space is endowed with the finite projective geometry @xcite @xmath46 the group of all possible basis transformations in this space is the projective group @xmath10 : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the general linear group of @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is its center , which consists of @xmath51 unit matrices multiplied by a ` phase ' in @xmath44 .",
    "effectively , the elements of @xmath10 lead to permutations of the states in @xmath52 , and is thus a subgroup of the symmetric group of all possible state permutations .",
    "physically , basis transformations should correspond to the change of ` detector setting , ' _ e.g. _ the rotation of the polarizaton axis of a spin - measuring device .",
    "let us denote the gqm model resulting from this procedure as @xmath53 .",
    "spin - like systems with two possible outcomes @xmath4 can be constructed on the space @xmath54 as @xmath55 , and two - particle spin - like systems on @xmath56 as @xmath57 . in the following",
    ", we will consider the cases @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 as concrete examples of this procedure .",
    "we begin our discussion with @xmath18 . the spin - like system is @xmath59 ,",
    "perhaps the simplest quantum system imaginable , which is constructed on the finite field consisting of only two elements , @xmath60 , with the following addition and multiplication tables :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus , @xmath61 and the relation @xmath62 is obtained as before .",
    "maintaining this relation would require relabeling the dual vectors in the same way as the vectors under basis transformations .",
    "from the set of six dual - vectors , we can define @xmath63 observables with outcomes @xmath4 , or 15 if we count the ` spins ' pointing in opposite directions as the same observable .",
    "these ` spins ' can be associated with actual directions in 3d , and their transformations under the subgroup of @xmath64 mentioned above with rotations in @xmath1 as shown in : first , label the 12 faces of a dodecahedron with 6 letters @xmath65 , with each letter appearing twice on faces that oppose each other , a shown in ( a ) .",
    "note that the dodecahedron is dual to the icosahedron , under the interchange of vertices and faces , so its symmetry group under rotations is the icosahedral group @xmath66 , which was shown to be isomorphic to @xmath67 in the @xmath68 case we discussed above .",
    "each of the rotations of the icosahedral group will lead to an even permutation of the six letters on the faces of the dodecahedron .",
    "these will generate the subgroup of @xmath64 consisting of even permutations only .",
    "the ` direction ' of the ` spin ' observable @xmath69 can be associated with the direction of the arrow shown in ( b ) .",
    "all 30 ` spin ' directions can be mapped this way , and ( c ) shows the resulting urchin of spin - directions .",
    "these 30 ` spins ' transform into each other under @xmath70 rotations .    unfortunately , there are 60 more elements of @xmath64 unaccounted for , and these do not seem to be representable as rotations or reflections of the dodecahedron .",
    "thus , in a sense , the ` rotations ' in the state space of @xmath71 are much richer than a finite group of @xmath1 rotations .",
    "as we have seen , for the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 cases , the group @xmath73 itself , or its invariant subgroup , is isomorphic to some polyhedral group , allowing for the identification of those @xmath73 group elements with @xmath1 rotations .",
    "therefore , our ` spins ' can be considered objects that transform like canonical spin under ` rotations ' for these cases .",
    "whether a similar pattern emerges for @xmath74 and beyond remains to be explored .",
    "in general , the @xmath73 group is a subgroup of @xmath75 of order @xmath76 . constructing a correspondence via the method we employed in this paper",
    "would require the labeling of the faces of some polyhedron with @xmath77 symbols .",
    "given that only 5 platonic solids and 13 archimedean solids are at our disposal , it is not at all clear that such a correspondence exists for generic @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper , we have elaborated on galois field quantum mechanics ( gqm ) introduced in our previous letter @xcite . in particular",
    "we have examined in detail the cases of @xmath59 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath71 .",
    "the fascinating geometric structure that underlies gqm as encapsulated by the finite projective geometry @xcite is interesting in itself , and it also represents the simplest theoretical playground for understanding some outstanding issues in the foundations of quantum theory , quantum information and quantum computation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear to us if gqm has an immediate realization in any physical system .",
    "most dynamical systems exist in continuous spaces , with continuous group operations",
    ". however , there could exist parameter spaces of complex systems , such as those in quantum computation and information theory , which can be considered as finite fields , and in those cases , the results obtained here could have relevance .",
    "the pictures we present here could provide a context to better understand what is happening in these systems .",
    "as already emphasized in @xcite , gqm should also prove useful in understanding the still mysterious super - quantum limit @xcite and its possible relation to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "that the galois fields should be of relevance in going beyond quantum field theory has been conjectured a long time ago @xcite , and our effort should be understood as a natural realization of that prescient old intuition .",
    "features of gqm should shed light on questions raised in the geometric formulation of canonical quantum theory @xcite and in the natural generalization of the geometric quantum theory @xcite argued to be relevant to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "these questions lie outside of the scope of this paper , and will be taken up elsewhere @xcite .",
