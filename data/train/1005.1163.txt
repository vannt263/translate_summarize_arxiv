    "the state of matter at extreme densities continues to be an issue of vigorous investigation .",
    "the problem is complicated , not only from the theoretical point of view , but also by the fact that laboratory experiments are restricted .",
    "for example , while colliders like rhic at brookhaven , gsi in darmstadt and the lhc at cern probe hot quark - gluon plasmas they will never be able to explore the cold , extreme high density , region of the qcd phase diagram . in order to test our understanding of the relevant physics we need to turn to astrophysics , and the dynamics of compact stars .",
    "in fact , `` neutron stars '' represent unique laboratories of such extreme physics . with core densities reaching about one order of magnitude beyond nuclear saturation , they are likely to contain exotic states of matter like hyperon phases with net strangeness and/or deconfined quarks .",
    "it is well - established that these states of matter should exhibit superfluidity / superconductivity at the relevant temperatures ( neutron stars are born with temperatures @xmath1  k and rapidly cool below @xmath2  k ) .",
    "moreover , observed radio pulsar glitches provide strong evidence for the presence of a partially decoupled superfluid component in these systems .",
    "the modelling of the dynamics of these , potentially complex , objects presents a serious challenge .",
    "a key aspect of the problem concerns the fact that a superfluid system has additional dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "this is well - known from experiments on laboratory systems like @xmath0he , which exhibit a second sound associated with thermal waves @xcite .",
    "analogous `` superfluid '' modes have been studied in detail for superfluid neutron - proton - electron mixtures relevant for the outer core of a neutron star @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", these studies have almost exclusively ignored thermal effects ( the work in @xcite is a notable exception ) .",
    "while this is a useful first approximation it is clear that the zero temperature assumption must be relaxed in a realistic model .",
    "basically , due to the density dependence of the various superfluid pairing gaps ( see @xcite for a guide to the literature ) , there will be regions in a neutron star where thermal effects are important ( in the vicinity of the critical density at which the phase transition occurs ) . understanding the nature of these transition regions , and",
    "their effect on various aspects of neutron star dynamics , is one of the main challenges for research in this area .    in this paper , we describe a first attempt at modelling thermal dynamics in a superfluid neutron star .",
    "we focus on stars with a colour - flavour - locked ( cfl ) superconducting quark core @xcite at finite temperatures .",
    "this is an interesting problem for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the simplest possible model for this system considers a quark condensate coupled to a gas of phonons .",
    "this problem is analogous to @xmath0he at low temperatures , and hence we can bring our recent dissipative two - fluid model @xcite to bear on it ( more or less directly ) .",
    "the lessons we learn from this exercise should inform the development of finite temperature models for the superfluids in the outer core and the neutron star crust .",
    "secondly , even though there have been discussions of the dynamics of the different cfl phases , in particular in the context of the gravitational - wave driven r - mode instability ( see @xcite for references ) , the superfluid aspects have ( as far as we are aware ) not previously been accounted for .",
    "our discussion begins to address the relevance of the additional degrees of freedom in these systems , and provides some insight into the nature of the different `` fluids '' involved .    as an application with immediate astrophysical relevance",
    ", we will work out the inertial r - modes and estimate the relevant viscous damping rates for the `` simplest '' model of cfl matter .",
    "we consider the `` cool '' regime where the temperature is significantly below all the quasiparticle energy gaps .",
    "in this regime , dissipation may mainly occur due to phonon interactions .",
    "one reason for considering this model is that there are results in the literature for both bulk- and shear viscosity @xcite as well as the mutual friction associated with superfluid vortices @xcite .",
    "of course , the simple `` condensate plus phonon '' model that we consider is not the whole story .",
    "it should apply at asymptotically high densities , but may not be the true ground state at lower densities .",
    "the discussion in @xcite adds extra dimensions to the problem by considering the bulk viscosity due to kaons ( allowing for flavour - changing processes ) , which will be present at higher temperatures . at first sight",
    ", this mechanism will only be relevant for very hot stars ( @xmath3  mev  @xmath4  k ) since it assumes that there is a thermal population of kaons .",
    "below the critical energy where the kaons appear the contribution to the bulk viscosity is exponentially suppressed and may not be that important . however , in more recent work on the so - called cfl - k@xmath5 phase @xcite , it is argued that the main low temperature mechanism involves condensed kaons .",
    "this is important since the kaon condensate will remain present as @xmath6 .",
    "the upshot of this is that the problem requires a `` multi - fluid '' analysis at all temperatures .",
    "the simplest model would have three components ; the quark condensate , the kaon condensate and finite temperature excitations ( phonons and thermal kaons ) .",
    "this problem is more involved than the case that we focus on here .",
    "nevertheless , our results provide an essential starting point for investigations into the dynamical role of the kaons .",
    "most importantly , by providing the `` hydrodynamics '' view of the problem we illustrate the input needed to study various dynamical scenarios .",
    "this should stimulate further discussion between experts on different aspects of this multi - faceted problem , as required to make progress in the future .",
    "we consider a deconfined quark system system that contains a single cfl superconducting condensate and a phonon gas .",
    "formally , this problem is identical to that for @xmath0he at low temperatures .",
    "hence , we can take as our starting point the recent discussion of superfluid helium @xcite , which is based on the convective variational approach to multi - fluid dynamics @xcite and which we know is in one - to - one correspondence with the orthodox formulation developed by , in particular , khalatnikov @xcite .",
    "the variational model takes as its starting point an energy functional @xmath7 , representing the equation of state .",
    "this energy determines the relation between the various fluxes and the associated canonical momenta . in the present case ,",
    "we distinguish between the massive particles in the system , with number density @xmath8 and flowing with @xmath9 from a massless entropy component with number density @xmath10 and flux @xmath11 .",
    "the latter represents the phonons ( which are treated in the fluid approximation , i.e. , we assume that there exists a suitable defined `` average '' transport velocity for each of the two components in the system ) the two momentum densities then follow from   and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "indices , which range from 1 to 3 , can be raised and lowered with the ( flat space ) metric @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "derivatives are expressed in terms of the covariant derivative @xmath15 which is consistent with the metric in the sense that @xmath16 .",

    "we use analogous expressions for gradients of the relative velocity .",
    "the definition of the various quantities should be obvious from the constituent indices .",
    "however , since the system that we consider is not irrotational we need to consider relaxing the assumptions on the dissipation coefficients .",

    "the standard approach to the rotating problem is to add in this `` mutual friction '' force , keeping the other dissipative terms as in the irrotational case .",

    "this means that the first term in the force can be ignored , leaving only the second , dissipative , contribution .",
    "in order to set the stage for the discussion of r - modes , we need to provide a suitable rotating equilibrium configuration . to do this",
    ", we note that the two components flow together ( there is not heat flux ) when the system is in thermal equilibrium .",

    "thus , it follows from the entropy momentum equation that we must have s _",
    "i t = 0 t =  .",
    "this is trivial ; if the system is isothermal then there will be no heat flux .",

    "this analysis shows that a rotating configuration can be obtained in the usual way .",
    "once we assume thermal equilibrium , we are dealing with a single - fluid problem .",
    "our main aim is to develop the tools required to make quantitative estimates for the r - mode instability in neutron stars with a cfl core . in doing this ,",
    "we want to account for the fact that cfl matter requires a multi - fluid description .",
    "the analysis proceeds in three steps .",
    "first we need to formulate the linear perturbation problem for the system .",
    "this step is interesting because , as far as we are aware , this is the first time that perturbations of a matter plus massless entropy system have been considered in an astrophysical context .",
    "the results provide useful insights into finite temperature superfluid dynamics , and should be relevant in a broader context .",
    "the second step corresponds to determining the pulsation modes of the system , in this case the r - modes , and finally we need to estimate the damping timescales associated with the different dissipation channels . in the discussion",
    "below , we only work out the first of these steps in detail . in order to obtain useful estimates for the r - mode instability",
    "we simplify last two steps by considering a uniform density model .",
    "this has the advantage that the r - mode solution is simple , and we can evaluate the dissipation rates analytically . in a sense , we do not expect this approximation to be too bad because it is well known that the density profile for a canonical @xmath36/10  km strange star ( described by the mit bag model ) is almost flat ( see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , we really need to develop a consistent model for a realistic equation of state .",
    "this is essential if we want to study hybrid stars , where the cfl phase is only present in the core .",
    "however , the problem is complicated by the fact that the bulk viscosity damping of the r - modes requires the perturbations to be worked out to second order in the slow - rotation approximation @xcite .",
    "this necessitates a numerical solution , which makes some of the qualitative behaviour of the results less clear .",
    "another complicating factor is the well - known fact that it only makes sense to use a realistic equation of state in a fully general relativistic analysis ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "the r - modes in single component relativistic stars have been studied @xcite , but there has not yet been any serious analysis of the corresponding multi - fluid problem ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "a focussed effort in this direction should be encouraged .      in order to work out the r - mode solutions , it is advantageous to work in a rotating frame . focussing , for the moment , on the non - dissipative equations we find that , in a frame rotating uniformly with @xmath37 we have _ t _ i^+ _ j ( v_^j _ i^ ) + n _ i ( _ + m - m v_^2 ) + _",

    "j^_i v_^j = 0  , [ rot_eulers ] it is notable that the coriolis force does not affect the entropy equation .",
    "this is , however , not surprising .",
    "it is well - known that inertial forces are proportional to the mass , and since our entropy component is taken to be massless it should not be affected by the coriolis force . from a technical point of view , it means that the problem we consider is subtly different from the two - fluid r - mode problem discussed in @xcite .    let us now consider perturbations of the rotating equilibrium models discussed in the previous section . considering eulerian perturbations ( denoted by @xmath38 ) we have , in the rotating frame ( using the cowling approximation @xmath39 , and not explicity denoting the velocities as perturbations since they vanish in the background anyway ) ; _ t v_i^- 2_t w_i^ + _ i _ + 2 _ ijk ^j v_^k = 0  , [ comove]and 2_t w_i^ + s _ i t = 0  .",

    "t s + _ i ( s v_^i ) = _ t s + _ i ( s v_^i ) - _ i ( s w_^i ) = 0  .",
    "the entropy is conserved since there is no heat flux in the background ( @xmath42 is quadratic in the heat flux @xcite ) .",
    "once we provide an equation of state for matter , we have all relations we need to study the linear dynamics of a non - dissipative finite temperature cfl quark core .",
    "our main aim is to work out the r - modes and establish the parameter range in which gravitational - wave emission triggers a secular instability . in order to assess the relevance of this instability we need to consider the various dissipative mechanisms that counteract the growth of an unstable mode .",
    "the damping due to shear- and bulk viscosity in a two - component system can be estimated using the strategy set out in @xcite .",
    "that is , we use energy integrals to estimate the various timescales .",
    "in essence , the damping timescale @xmath43 associated with any given process is obtained from 2 e ^-1  , where @xmath7 is the energy associated with the flow and @xmath44 is the rate of energy loss due to dissipation .",
    "this estimate should be accurate as long as the dissipation is weak enough that it does not affect the flow on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the energy associated with a given perturbation can be obtained from the equations of motion and .",
    "multiplying the first equation by @xmath45 and the second by @xmath46 ( where the bars denote complex conjugates ) and adding , we find that the kinetic energy is given by e= ( | v_|^2 - | w_|^2 ) dv  . in the case of the r - modes , this is the leading order contribution to the energy .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the second term in the bracket is of higher order in the slow - rotation approximation ( for the same reasons as in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the r - mode energy is well approximated by e | v_|^2 dv  .    in order to evaluate the energy loss due to viscous damping we add the dissipative part of the stress tensor @xmath47 to the equations of motion .",
    "the total energy dissipation then follows from the body integral of @xmath48 after some algebra , this leads to = - dv  , [ diss1 ] where we have defined = _",
    "recall the relations and and the definition @xmath49 .    in order to combine this result with existing results for the viscosity coefficients",
    "we need to translate our variables into those of the `` orthodox '' two - fluid model due to , for example , khalatnikov @xcite .",
    "the required translation has been discussed at length in @xcite , and the key relations that we need are given in the appendix .",
    "carrying out the comparison , we find that the shear viscosity terms are exactly the same in the two descriptions .",
    "hence , we can use @xmath50 from @xcite without change . in the case of the bulk viscosity , we find that the two sets of coefficients have different mass scalings , and we identify = _ 2 , ^= m _ 1 = m _ 4 , ^ = m^2 _ 3  .",
    "this means that , when expressed in terms of the standard coefficients , the bulk viscosity dissipation rate becomes = - dv  .",
    "[ diss2 ]    to conclude , there are three bulk viscosity coefficients rather than the usual single one , and both dynamical degrees of freedom are needed if we want to evaluate the dissipation integrals .",
    "note that the dissipation is expressed in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , rather than @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the variables that we will solve for when we determine the r - modes .",
    "it is , of course , straightforward to express in terms of these variables .",

    "in order to obtain quantitative results for the r - mode instability we need to provide an equation of state .",

    "in fact , some of the parameters that we need are usually not considered , essentially since they are not required if one is only interested in equilibrium configurations . in order to make progress we have to build a suitably simple model equation of state . to do this , we assume that the thermal contribution due to the phonons adds to a zero - temperature equation of state for the condensate . this strategy has previously been developed for a relativistic superfluid @xcite , and builds on the classic expressions for a non - relativistic phonon gas , see @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to note that the phonon shear viscosity in the cfl case leads to the strongest r - mode damping at temperatures above @xmath98  k. of course , astrophysical neutron stars will cool to temperatures much lower than this soon after birth so this region may not be that relevant .",
    "the results in the figure show , quite clearly , that we need to improve our understanding of the low - temperature regime .",
    "the instability curve below the @xmath98  k is obtained using our phenomenological model .",
    "future work needs to model this regime in detail .    for comparison , we also show the observed spin and inferred core temperature for a number of astrophysical systems in figure  [ instab ] ( the data is taken from @xcite ) .",
    "this comparison is somewhat inconsistent because we have assumed that the core is shielded by a normal crust with a thickness of , at least , a few hundred meters ( so that the standard heat - blanket argument @xcite applies .",
    "the presence of a normal matter outer region should provide addition r - mode dissipation channels that we have not considered .",
    "in particular , one would expect a viscous boundary layer at the crust - core interface to be a more efficient damping agent ( see @xcite for the most recent discussion ) than the phonon mechanisms that we have considered .",
    "we also indicate the region of parameter space where accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries would be located ( given the usual arguments @xcite ) .",
    "these systems would be at variance with the pure cfl plus phonon model in the sense that they would be located deep into the unstable region .",
    "if there were an active r - mode instability in these systems , one would expect it to have observational effects on , for example , the spin evolution .",
    "observations do not provide any evidence of this .",
    "we have presented the first true multi - fluid analysis of a dense neutron star core with a deconfined , colour - flavour - locked superconducting , quark core . by focussing on a cool system , and accounting only for the condensate and ( finite temperature ) phonons , we made progress by taking over much of the formalism from the analogous problem for superfluid @xmath0he , the archetypal two - fluid laboratory system .",
    "the additional fluid degree of freedom , in the present case represented by the phonon gas , leads to the system not being well represented by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "in particular , a complete model requires a number of additional viscosity coefficients .    without an actual calculation",
    "it is not easy to establish whether the multi - fluid aspects are relevant or not .",
    "for example , in the case of the gravitational - wave driven instability of the f - modes it is known that the superfluid degree of freedom is very important , since the vortex mutual friction may completely suppress that instability below a critical temperature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that , because of the different nature of the associated velocity field , the mutual friction does not affect the r - mode instability in the same drastic fashion @xcite .",
    "these examples provide clear evidence that different problems need to be considered on a case - by - case basis .",
    "we have provided a detailed dissipative formulation for a system comprising a quark ( cfl ) condensate and phonons .",
    "the model builds on recent improvements in our understanding of the analogous problems of superfluid @xmath0he @xcite and causal heat conductivity @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient is the massless entropy component that represents the phonon excitations .",
    "we have discussed how the superfluid constraint of irrotationality reduces the number of required viscosity coefficients to four ( one shear and three bulk ) , and provided a translation between results in the literature @xcite and the coefficients in our formalism .",
    "we also emphasised that many more dissipative channels may come into play in a rotating system where superfluid vortices are present @xcite .",
    "in particular , we showed how the vortex mediated mutual friction is accounted for in the model , and translated the available results for the associated coefficients @xcite .    in order to be able to make relevant estimates for the r - mode instability",
    ", we developed a simple two - component equation of state based on the mit bag model at zero temperatures with an additional phonon gas representing the thermal component .",
    "this example highlights the additional information that is needed in a multi - fluid analysis , in particular , regarding the entrainment coupling .",
    "future work needs to provide a consistent equation of state , including the key aspects .",
    "the model equation of state completed the formulation of the problem and we could , in principle , have carried out a numerical study of the r - modes .",
    "we opted not to do this , instead introducing a sequence of simplifying assumptions , because we felt that it would be useful to start by working out some less precise estimates for the relevant dissipation timescales .",
    "a numerical analysis of the problem should , of course , be encouraged .",
    "the problem has a number of interesting aspects , and may shed light on how one should deal with finite temperature superfluid neutron stars in general .",
    "this work was motivated by a desire to understand the different phases of cfl matter from a hydrodynamics point of view .",
    "it is , obviously , an interesting problem and the notion that observations of gravitational waves from relativistic stars may help shed light on the extreme qcd phase diagram is exciting .",
    "the r - mode instability has been discussed in this context for some time , see for example @xcite , but there has not been any previous discussion of the multi - fluid aspects of the problem .",
    "we hope that this work will stimulate a more detailed discussion between experts in the relevant areas .",
    "the fact that the various phonon processes that we have accounted for can be shown to have little effect on the r - mode instability should not discourage future efforts .",
    "in fact , the result could probably have been anticipated .",
    "the real challenge will be to account for additional degrees of freedom , especially associated with the kaons ( either thermal or in a condensate ) @xcite , and the modelling of `` hybrid '' stars with quark cores and various phase transitions .",
    "these problems have additional features that , while possibly understood in principle , have never been considered in practice .",
    "this makes the modelling more complex , but also intriguing since the richer dynamics may lead to surprises .",
    "the relationship between the flux conservative formulation and the orthodox framework for superfluid helium has been examined in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "still , it is useful to summarise the main results that are needed to relate the different dissipation coefficients .",
    "first of all , we identify the `` normal '' fluid in the standard description with the gas of excitations , which is directly associated with the entropy of the system .",
    "this leads to v^i_=v^i _  .",
    "secondly , the so - called `` superfluid '' velocity is given by v^i_==(1-)v_^i+v_^i  , where @xmath130 is the entropy entrainment parameter .",
    "this means that the total mass flux takes the form v_^i=_v_n^i+_v^i_  , from which we learn that _  = _ = -  , where @xmath131 and @xmath62 are the superfluid and normal fluid densities .",
