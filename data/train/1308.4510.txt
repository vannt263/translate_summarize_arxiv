    "quasi - local concepts , like the mass of a cosmic structure in contrast to the mass of a test particle , and the concept of the event horizon or boundary of a black hole , are usually sensitive to global assumptions like being asymptotically flat or asymptotically frw background , irrespective of how weak or strong the gravity may be . for example , the unique exact event horizon of a schwarzschild black hole is split into an apparent and an approximative event horizon once it is considered as a dynamical cosmic black hole @xcite .",
    "these counter - intuitive effects not detected in the perturbational approach are inherent in the presence of the quasi - local phenomena .",
    "the definition of quasi - local mass of a structure in general relativity is another example @xcite : in general there are many definitions for it , none of them being preferred .",
    "it has already been shown numerically how different various quasi - local mass definitions of a general relativistic structure may be @xcite .",
    "the matching behavior of a spherically symmetric cosmological structure glued to a frw background with the necessity of a void reflected in its density profile @xcite is another example of a quasi - local phenomenon relevant to the gravitational lensing problem we are going to study in this paper .",
    "quasi - local field irregularities , such as the wall of large voids , may also lead to new relativistic effects not inferred from the familiar approximative approaches , as shown in @xcite .",
    "+    our aim in this paper is to study the exact general relativistic gravitational lensing by a spherically symmetric overdensity structure within an frw universe and compare it with the corresponding th - l approach to understand more exactly the accuracy of this technology as a perturbation to the exact general relativistic model calculation .",

    "our cosmic structure is defined by an exact solution of the einstein equations not produced by a cut - and - paste technology to be sure that all dynamical quasi - local effects are taken into account and to avoid the case of freezing of probable effects or features due to the gluing of different manifolds .",

    ", we will always include a void in our definitions of the density profiles .      in the case",
    "some boundary conditions are given the field equations can be integrated to specify the model .",
    "the corresponding algorithm is formulated by krasiski and hellaby @xcite .",
    "we are interested in a model based on a known density profile .",
    "it is then necessary to specify the density profile at two different times @xmath37 as a function of the coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "now , the algorithm is based on the choice of @xmath5-coordinate such that @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath15 is an increasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 and @xmath39 become functions of @xmath40 .",
    "the ltb functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 may then be extracted from the algorithm . for the initial time",
    "we choose the time of the last scattering surface : @xmath43 .",
    "the initial density profile should show a small over - density near the center imitating otherwise a frw universe .",
    "therefore , we add a gaussian peak to the frw background density . we know",

    "the mass compensation condition leads to an equation for @xmath48 . for the final time",
    "we choose the time when our null geodesy has the nearest distance to the center of our model structure .",
    "for instance if we set our lens at the redshift @xmath49 then @xmath50 ( in the flat matter dominated universe , the present time is about @xmath51 if we set @xmath52 ) . the density profile that we choose for this time is the universal halo density profile ( nfw ) @xcite convolved with a negative gaussian profile for mass compensation plus background density at that time : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 in our numerical calculation we will use typical values @xmath56 and @xmath57 for a cluster . note that at the time @xmath58 a black hole singularity covered by an apparent horizon has already been evolved .",
    "therefore , the nfw profile has to be modified and a black hole mass greater than a minimum value has to be added to it at the center .",
    "this physical fact is reflected in a shell crossing singularity if we take the familiar nfw profile similar to that assumed for the time @xmath59 .",
    "the mass we have assumed for this black hole singularity is about one thousandth of the mass up to the @xmath60 and equal to @xmath61",
    "[ emclnfw ] and [ tnclnfw ] shows the ltb functions @xmath6 and @xmath39 as a result of these boundary assumptions . using these ltb functions , the density profile of our model structure",

    "[ nfwden ] .",
    "our aim now is to study the path of a light ray emitting from a distant source far from the observer within our expanding inhomogeneous universe passing a gravitational lens .",
    "the result will then be compared with the familiar thin lens approximation in a frw universe .",
    "this will show us how far this approximation is valid and where one has to expect deviations . to do this we have to explore suitable numerical methods to integrate the geodesic equations .",
    "it turns out this is a non - trivial integration and special cares have to be taken . to solve these equations we need four initial conditions , given the light - like condition ( [ null ] ) .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the affine parameter reduces our initial conditions to three .",
    "the general relativistic model being defined now leads to the geodesic equations to be integrated numerically .",
    "the integration of the geodesics happens by a backshooting procedure .",
    "our initial conditions are , therefore , the time of observation , distance of the observer from the lens expressed in terms of the redshift of the lens at the time of observation , and angle between the line of sight to the image of source and the line of sight to the lens or image angle at the observer location ( @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ lensdiag ] ) : + @xmath63 the integration is done from the observer to the source ( at a specific redshift ) .",
    "assuming then there is no lens , the model is a homogenous flat frw universe and the geodesics are straight lines ( in comoving coordinates ) allowing us to determine angle between the source and the lens ( @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ lensdiag ] ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 angle , @xmath68 is the comoving distance of the observer , and @xmath69 is the comoving distance of the source from the center of coordinate system in the absence of the lens at the time @xmath70 defined by the root of the equation @xmath71.\\ ] ]    we then may write the lens equation and determine the deflection angle @xmath72 : @xmath73 where we have assumed that the presence of the lens has not a significant effect on the distances and we may use the corresponding frw distances .",
    "the reason that we calculate @xmath72 instead of @xmath33 is that it is independent of distances and is a local quantity that depends only on the lens parameters .      given the complexity of the differential equations we intend to integrate , the numerical method we use may be very sensitive .",
    "we first started with the familiar runge - kutta adaptive step size algorithm with proportional and integral feedback ( pi control ) @xcite in which the step size is adjusted to keep local error under a suitable threshold .",
    "we started with the so - called embedded runge - kutta of the rank 5(4 ) .",
    "it turned out , however , that its accuracy is too low .",
    "therefore , we tried the rank 8(7 ) and then the rank 11(10 ) algorithm .",
    "the difference between these two last ranks , however , turned out to be marginal and below one percent , given the time - consuming rank 11(10 ) algorithm , we preferred to use the rank 8(7 ) one .",
    "now , as a first test for the accuracy of the numerical method we tried the trivial case of an ltb model namely the frw case expecting a null result . a non - negligible deflection angle of the order of few miliarc seconds turned out as the result as shown in fig . [ frwrk ] .",
    "we suspected to face a numerical effect . to understand the numerical algorithm more deeply and the source of the effect more clearly , we continued to calculate a more concrete and non - trivial ltb case , and tried two different density profiles .",
    "the result for the rank 8(7 ) runge - kutta numerical method applied to a structure with a compact density profile did agree with the thin lens approximation . however , in the case of a more diffuse density profile the result showed a deflection angle up to an order of magnitude higher than the thin lens approximation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ toyrk78 ] . suspecting the effect to be not a genuine one but just a numerical artefact due to the errors in the ltb metric functions",
    ", we did increase the accuracy of that part of calculations related to the sensitive ltb functions .",
    "the problem , however , persisted even in the case of the toy model with analytic metric functions .",
    "we therefore did not trust the result and turned to other numerical methods !",
    "+    the root of the numerical deficiency could be due to the term @xmath74 in our equations , which is almost zero in the most part of the path of the light ray and changes suddenly to @xmath75 in the vicinity of the lens .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon in the numerical calculation of the differential equations called as `` stiff '' @xcite .",
    "the characteristic property of such equations is the presence of two quite different scales .",
    "in our case we have on one side the cosmological distance scale of the source relative to the lens and observer and on the side the scale of the structure or the nearest distance of the ray to the lens .",
    "this led us to the so - called semi - implicit rosenbrock method of the numerical integration of differential equations @xcite .",
    "as a first test we did again the trivial case of a frw model . the result shown in fig .",
    "[ frwros ] , in contrast to fig .",
    "[ frwrk ] , is an acceptable one , showing how sensitive different numerical methods maybe .",
    "therefore , we have done the integration of the geodesic equations by using the semi - implicit rosenbrock method .    in the case of nfw profile , there are regions where the calculation of ltb metric functions needs more accuracy . within the parametrization we are using ,",
    "this occurs at the deep sector of the underdense region where the mass , say @xmath5 , increases very slowly .",
    "we therefore decrease the mass step there . during the interpolation procedure",
    "we have checked if the results of the derivatives due to the interpolation coincides within the required accuracy with the independent results for the same derivatives according to numerical algorithm . in cases of large deviations we have increased the number of interpolating points to achieve the required accuracy .",
    "our aim is to compare the result of the exact model with the thin lens approximation to see if and how they my differ .",
    "the fermat principle used in the thin lens approximation means that the light rays choose the minimum time . within the gravitational lensing effect",
    "we expect , however , two different terms for the time delay due to different paths and due to different gravitational potentials .",
    "it is well known that in the presence of the gravitational field @xmath76 , clocks work slower by a factor of @xmath77 . given the assumption that the light path does not deviate from the background path except at the lens plane , the geometrical time delay can be approximated easily by the cosines law in the @xmath78 triangle of fig .",
    "[ lensdiag ] :    @xmath79    to obtain the gravitational part , we first solve the geodesic equations of the thin lens approximation to first order in the gravitational field @xmath76 .",
    "the perturbed frw metric in the newtonian gauge is written as @xmath80    the corresponding gravitational time delay consists of two parts : a part which mainly depends on the metric and lens - source - observer configuration and is almost independent of the light trajectory or the image in the interested cases of small @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , it is usually canceled out while calculating the time delay for two images of the same configuration . however , in our case , being interested in the time interval difference between a lensed image in an inhomogeneous ltb model and the corresponding unlensed image in a frw model , one has to take this `` configuration - term '' into consideration@xcite .",
    "now , the time delay is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the scaled surface mass density of the lens . in the case of",
    "axially symmetric case this term simplifies to @xmath84 assuming a point like lens ( @xmath85 ) , this term for the gravitational time delay leads to @xmath86 . if we assume , however , a nfw density profile , we obtain @xmath87 where @xmath88 . + the configuration - term of the time delay is given by @xmath89",
    "it is easily seen that for a point like lens this term leads to @xmath90 .",
    "+ we have calculated numerically the contribution of each of the above terms in the gravitational time delay using a nfw density profile .",
    "the result is depicted in fig .",
    "[ grtd ] . evidently , the contribution of the second term is approximately constant . therefore , in the usual case of measuring the difference of time delays for two or more images , this term may be ignored",
    ". however , given our interest of comparing time delays to the frw case , we have to keep this term .",
    "+    there is another issue we have to face .",
    "the two metrics ( [ ltbm ] ) and ( [ frwper ] ) are not written in the same gauge .",
    "we have therefore to see how to transform the coordinates from the newtonian gauge to synchronous ltb time and look for probable effects on the time delay we are interested in .",
    "this is done by k. van acoleyen @xcite and a. paranjape , t. p.",
    "singh @xcite : @xmath91 this transformation is related to the observer moving from infinity to the comoving distance @xmath5 and back again to infinity .",
    "it is therefore seen that the extra term in ( [ ttrans ] ) is canceled out .",
    "hence , the time delays in these two coordinates are equal , as expected due to the fact that both metrics tends to frw metric at infinity .",
    "now , neglecting the second term and applying the fermat principle , we obtain the lens equation @xcite : @xmath92",
    "given the ambiguity of the mass definition in general relativity , the interpretation of the results require a more than usual details to be checked .",
    "that is why we have looked for different results corresponding to six different data sets , depending on the underlying model and assumptions to calculate the deflection angle , and on the mass associated to a definite density profile .",
    "we already know that there are different masses corresponding to one and the same density profile , none of them being preferred on the physical basis .",
    "+ we first calculate different cases related to a toy model density profile .",
    "this will show us the characteristic features of different conditions of our model being based on the ltb or a thin lens- ( tl- ) model .",
    "we then go on to assume a nfw density profile and a structure of the scale of a galaxy structure and compare the results of ltb with tl model using different cutoffs .",
    "the time delay for different models and a comparison of its features relative to the deviation angle is also given .",

    "the most relevant result is that the general relativistic exact model leads to almost identical result to the thin lens approximation with the relevant density being the overdensity @xmath99 if one chooses the cut off at a point where the void matches to the background .",

    "we know already that the matching of any overdensity region to a background in general realtivity goes through an underdensity region or a void @xcite . in the case of exact ltb model",
    "this is implicitly done by the integration of the geodesics . in the nfw case",

    "in this paper we have studied the lensing effect on the deviation angle and time delay of cosmological light rays using an exact general relativistic ltb model for a structure within an frw universe .",
    "the results are compared with the thin lens approximation used in the gravitational lensing literature for a toy model structure and a structure with a nfw density profile .",
    "we have also differentiated a normal nfw density profile going to zero and a modified one with a void before matching to the frw background .",
    "the aim of the paper has been to study if and how viable the thin lens approximation based on the weak gravity in the lensing technology is .",
    "+ the main results of the paper is reflected in the figs .",
    "[ nfwdev ] , [ nfwgamma ] , and [ nfwtd ] .",
    "we have shown that by using our modified nfw density profile the thin lens approximation coincides with the exact ltb general relativistic structure model to a high accuracy . assuming a normal nfw density profile without a void",
    ", however , the thin lens approximation is not valid any more and the deviation angle may differ up to about 30 percent from the exact general relativistic calculation .",
    "this we have checked for different parameters of the nfw density profile .",
    "it turns out that the deviation increases with the increase of the @xmath101 parameter of the density profile , meaning that the deviation increases with the decrease of the compactness of the structure .",
    "looking at some of the available observational data for strong and weak lensing the general relativistic effects seems to be within the accuracy of the observation .",
    "+ we encounter a similar effect in the time delay of lensed images due to the gravitational lensing .",
    "+ we conclude that in translating the weak gravity to different astrophysical phenomenon one has to take care of global relativistic features .",
    "we know from general relativity that , in contrast to the newtonian dynamics , it is not possible to have an overdensity structure within an otherwise underdensity background except by the mediation of a void which compensates the overdensity @xcite .",
    "now , the familiar technology of thin lensing using a nfw density profile dismiss this void which could easily be included in a modified density profile . adding a void and using a modified nfw density profile correct this deficiency and one obtain a result almost identical to the exact general relativistic model .",
    "the deviation of the normal nfw density profile from the exact relativistic model depends on the compactness of the structure .",
    "the higher the compactness the less is the difference to the exact model .",
    "we should therefore see for such effects in the astrophysical observations of galaxy clusters of different compactness .",
    "this effect may influence our knowledge of the cluster masses and also the so - called concentration - mass relation of the galaxy clusters @xcite . in the large survey operated by the euclid mission several dozens of thousands of clusters up to the redshift @xmath112",
    "is expected to be detectable .",
    "therefore , we may be able not only to detect the effect we have calculated in this paper but also to use it to have a more precise estimate of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "sima ghassemi for very useful discussions .",
    "numerical calculations were carried out on bahman cluster of the school of astronomy , ipm , and the hpc lab of physics department of sharif university of technology .",
