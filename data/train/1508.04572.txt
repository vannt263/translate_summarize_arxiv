    "the morphological class of s0 galaxies has been largely debated since @xcite supposed their existence in  realm of the nebulae \" , and @xcite placed them as transition types in the tuning fork diagram . first suggested that s0 s might originate from spirals stripped out of gas and that this class of objects could form a dustless sequence that parallels the sa - sb - sc sequence in the hubble tuning fork .",
    "this idea was further developed by @xcite who proposed the class of  anemic spirals \" as intermediate objects between normal s0 s and spirals .",
    "historically there are essentially two main views concerning the origin of s0 galaxies : 1 ) s0 s are the end product of the transformation of spiral galaxies removed of their gas content by means of gravitational or non gravitational forces , or by secular evolution ; 2 ) the s0 class is intrinsic , _",
    "i.e. _  formed by objects that differ from spirals since their formation .    the proponents of the first view found support in the following observational facts : 1 ) a significant fraction of today s early - type galaxies likely evolved from later - type galaxies at relatively recent cosmic epochs",
    ". hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations revealed that spirals are proportionally much more common ( a factor of @xmath11 ) , and s0 galaxies much rarer , in distant than in nearby clusters ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    ": 1 ) the bulge - to - disk ratios ( @xmath12 ) of the two morphological classes are too different for being explained by the simple occurrence of gas stripping ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "if s0 s are evolved spirals , their bulge luminosities must have been physically enhanced ; 2 ) many edge - on s0 s are characterized by thick disks that are absent in the control samples of spirals ; 3 ) the relation between density and morphology is a weak function of density , so that a significant percentage of s0 s are in regions where the density and temperature is too low for a significant stripping of the gas @xcite ; 4 ) the large ages and magnesium - to - iron overabundance of the outer disks of nearby s0 s contradict the commonly accepted scenario of s0 formation from spirals by quenching their star formation during infall into dense environments at intermediate redshifts , @xmath13 ( 4 - 5 gyr ago ) @xcite ; 5 ) the evolution in the number density of s0 s from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is the result of morphological classification errors @xcite ; 6 ) neither the median ellipticity , nor the shape of the ellipticity distribution of cluster early - type galaxies evolve with redshift from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _  over the last @xmath17 gyr @xcite , suggesting that the bulge - to - disk ratio distribution for cluster early - type galaxies does not change with time .",
    "the controversy on the s0 origin is not yet settled after more than 70 years",
    "! there is however today a wide consensus that more than one process can operate the transformation of spirals into s0 s and that a significant role is played by the environment .    in low density environments",
    "the transformation of spirals into s0 s could be the end product of secular evolution .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that many s0 s in this environment host pseudo - bulges @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _  bulges with bulge - to - total luminosity ratios and concentrations typical of late - type spiral galaxies ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "these bulges often contain embedded disks , inner spiral patterns , nuclear bars , star formation , and present rotational support similar to that of spiral bulges ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these properties are usually attributed to the evolution induced by bars , which send material towards the center of the galaxy , enhancing the bulge component @xcite , even if often these bulges do not seem to have the concentrations and sizes of typical s0 s bulges ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite found that the buckling instability can lead to vertically thick inner bar components , which are several factors larger than the nuclear star forming structures .",
    "they have similar sizes as the boxy / peanut bulges in the s0s ( and in other hubble types ) in the edge - on view .",
    "furthermore , secular evolution offers a viable mechanism to produce the thick disk component observed in many edge - on s0 s .    in the cluster environment",
    "several mechanisms can operate the quenching of sf and start the transition of spirals toward the s0 class : 1 ) gas loss triggered by : galactic winds as a consequence of star formation or agn activity ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ram pressure stripping , i.e. the interaction between the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , strangulation , i.e. the removal of the hot gas halo surrounding the galaxy via ram pressure or tidal stripping by the halo potential @xcite , thermal evaporation , and turbulent / viscous stripping @xcite .",
    "2 ) strong tidal interactions and mergers , although more frequent in groups than in clusters , tidal effects from the cluster as a whole , and harassment , i.e. the cumulative effect of several weak and fast tidal encounters @xcite .",
    "ram pressure is one of the most accredited actors of the transformation of spirals in clusters .",
    "its importance resides in the fact that only the gaseous component of disk galaxies is affected .",
    "the ram pressure exerted by the igm is a key ingredient for understanding the star formation history ( sfh ) of galaxies in clusters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because temporal and spatial variations of the sf in disks can be produced by ram pressure .",
    "observations suggest that the h@xmath20-to - optical disk - size ratio is smaller for spirals with higher degrees of hi - deficiency @xcite .",
    "the merging hypothesis is also quite popular and old ( see e.g. , @xcite ; mechanism defined at that time `` collision between galaxies '' ) and often advocated for explaining the existence of s0 galaxies in low density environments ( e.g. groups and field ) where the mechanisms typical of clusters are less effective .",
    "this possibility found support in the discovery of `` polar ring s0 s '' , i.e. lenticular galaxies hosting structures likely due to a second event such as the transfer of mass from a companion galaxy during a close encounter as well as a true merger @xcite .",
    "@xcite stressed that a particular orbit configuration could transform two late - type spirals into one s0 galaxy with polar rings ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . a related phenomenology ,",
    "namely s0 s hosting an unexpected gas component counter - rotating or strongly kinematically decoupled with respect to the stellar body of the galaxy , has also been detected @xcite .",
    "even more , numerical simulations by @xcite indicate that the major mechanism for the s0 creation is galaxy merging between two spirals with unequal mass ; if this is true , unequal - mass galaxy mergers provide the evolutionary link between the large number of blue spirals observed in intermediate - redshift clusters and the red s0 s in the present - day ones",
    ".    an additional piece of evidence favoring the merging idea comes from the correlation observed in very nearby galaxies between ubv color residuals and the schweizer s fine - structure @xmath21 index , especially because the detected systematic variations are not limited to the nuclei , but occur globally in the stellar populations of galaxies @xcite . again with reference to observed colors , the so - called blue e / s0 galaxies studied by @xcite , i.e. objects having a clear early - type morphology on hst / acs images but with a blue rest - frame color , do resemble merger remnants probably migrating to the red - sequence in a short time - scale , when their mass is comparable ( or higher ) than that of the milky way .",
    "analogously @xcite identify several pieces of evidence favoring the same hypothesis i.e. that major mergers have played a dominant role in the definitive buildup of present - day e - s0 s with @xmath22 at @xmath23 .    at any rate",
    "the frequency of other photometric hints indicating a major role of merging events in s0 galaxies formation is still controversial .",
    "for instance the claim by @xcite , who find that  in the context of their n - body simulations  nearly 70% of their s0-like host anti - truncated ( type  iii ) stellar disks does not find support in the observational works by @xcite as well as by @xcite , who at variance conclude that the difference in the fractions of type - iii profiles between early ( presumably s0-s0a ) and late - type spirals is not statistically significant .",
    "in other words , it should not reasonable to conclude that type - iii photometric profiles are a special characteristic of s0 s .",
    "@xcite reports for a sample of @xmath24 field and cluster s0 s similar fractions of type profiles in both environments .    on the other side @xcite have shown that major mergers among binary galaxies can rebuild a bulge - disk coupling in the s0 remnants in less than @xmath253 gyr , after having destroyed the structures of the progenitors , whereas minor mergers directly preserve them .",
    "the resulting structural parameters span a wide range of values , and their distribution is consistent with observations . in their simulations",
    "many remnants have bulge srsic indices ranging @xmath26 , flat appearance , and contain residual star formation in embedded discs , a result which agrees with the presence of pseudo - bulges in real s0 s .",
    "@xcite also find that major mergers can explain the difference in the stellar angular momentum and concentration between spirals and s0 s .",
    "disentangling the mechanisms at work in the transformation of spirals into s0 galaxies is not easy even in very nearby objects . for more distant galaxies a combination of efforts",
    "are required , both in the sense of increasing the observational data available for galaxies in clusters at different redshifts , and in producing numerical simulations of increasing complexity . with this paper",
    "we want to contribute to this effort , discussing the data coming from two clusters surveys , wings ( wide field nearby galaxy cluster survey ; * ? ? ?",

    "we have excluded those clusters with less robust statistics in which the number of spirals members is @xmath144 .",

    "the most luminous x - ray clusters have preferentially a larger s0/sp ( and possibly e / sp ) fraction .",

    "the dependence of the morphological fractions on the x - ray luminosity of the clusters , and consequently on the temperature of the intra - cluster medium , led us to suspect that the mechanism of evaporation might play a role as significant as that of ram pressure .    in general ,",
    "if spirals transform into s0 s via gas stripping and quenching of sf , one might suspect that the mass distribution of present day s0 s should not be too different from the mass distribution of early spirals .",

    "we will see that do exist several suspects that merging events and gravitational interactions are active somewhere in the clusters and can contribute to the formation of s0 galaxies .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the possibility that s0 galaxies are produced via the merging of two spirals with unequal mass has been discussed since the late 1990s .",
    "@xcite found that simulations of the merging of two bulgeless galaxies ( with the gas component modeled ) and a mass ratio 0.3 could reproduce the photometric and structural properties of a typical s0 galaxy ( red color , absence of a stellar thin disk ) .",
    "@xcite discussed a similar scenario for s0 formation , and found a steepening of the photometric profiles toward the early - types due to satellite accretion .",
    "after a minor merger , bulges grow and the srsic index increases .",
    "@xcite found that intermediate mergers ( i.e. , events with mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:7 ) can produce remnants that photometrically and kinematically resemble s0 galaxies , consistent with the bulge - to - disk coupling observed in real s0 s .",
    "a significant disk heating is expected from minor mergers @xcite .",
    "these models provide support to the idea that minor / medium mergers lead to an increase of the srsic index value , if spheroids or b+d systems are involved .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that unequal mergers ( @xmath148 ) produces a steep increase in the srsic index in massive spheroid ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "repeated minor merging can even lead to the build - up of elliptical galaxies without resorting to major mergers @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed photometric profiles from the dissipative n - body binary merger simulations from the galmer database , and found that minor merger remnants can have low srsic indices @xmath26 , consistent with the presence of pseudo - bulges in observed s0s . in general therefore n - body simulations predict that the srsic index of the galaxies evolve , proportionally increasing with the dimension of the new formed bulge component .",
    "while red dots those for @xmath150 . ]    from an observational point of view we see evidences of ongoing tidal interactions in the wings galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this means that gravitational interactions and merging can still be active today in particular in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "unfortunately the analysis of present day s0 s does not easily reveal whether they are the end product of past merging events .",
    "direct proof of past accretion events could come from the analysis of the frequency of gcs or pn , or from a detailed analysis of the stellar populations and sfh .",
    "this is quite difficult already for very nearby objects , but almost impossible for far s0 s that can be studied only in their integrated properties .",
    "the only possible approach with our data is that of statistically distinguish the mean properties of the different morphological classes , and to check whether the observed differences might be explained by theoretical models .",
    "[ fig15 ] compares the b / t ratio and the srsic index derived from n - body simulations of major and minor merging events among binary galaxies with the corresponding values measured for the wings data set by sanchez - jannsen in his phd thesis .",
    "the figure suggests that the formation of cluster s0 galaxies by merging could be one element to consider , at least regarding its brightest representatives .",
    "however , it is not clear yet whether smaller cluster s0s can be the end product of merging events .",
    "the problem is that the high velocity dispersion in clusters does not favor the occurrence of merging .",
    "we therefore suspect that most of the merging events happen when galaxies reside in the outskirts of clusters or when they are still members of small groups that are infalling into the clusters .",
    "this means that a substantial pre - processing could be experienced by spirals before being virialized into the cluster environment .        a second hint in favor of the merging hypothesis comes from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we have seen that the fraction s0/e at low redshift can not be explained without a small increase of the e types , and this might be explained with major / minor merging events .    therefore , prompted by the idea that merging events are necessary for explaining the actual structure of s0 galaxies and the frequency of the morphological fractions in nearby clusters , we decided to check if the wings data in general , and the srsic index of s0 s and spirals in particular , are consistent with the merging hypothesis . if such hypothesis is correct , we expect to see an evolution of the srsic index , i.e. that @xmath45 increases as a consequence of multiple merging events experienced by spirals .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we have already shown that the srsic index of the various morphological classes are quite distinct both for various masses and for distances from the cluster center . the two figures showed that for a relatively broad mass range ( @xmath151 ) the mean srsic index of s0 s and today spirals has a systematic difference of @xmath152 .",
    "in other words , in the same mass range s0 s and spirals have different light profiles .",
    "we can distinguish three broad mass domains : small stellar mass @xmath153 : the systematic difference between s0 s and spirals is small . in this mass domain",
    ", we have the least massive systems with the smallest bulges , and @xmath45 is consistent with the presence of pseudo bulges , i.e. of structures that might originate from the secular evolution of disks . in the intermediate mass range",
    ", we observe instead systematically higher @xmath45 for s0 s and e s with respect to spirals .",
    "@xmath154 the @xmath45 value for spirals becomes not reliable because there are too few objects of this mass .",
    "the general trend is that as far as the spheroidal component of the galaxies increases , the value of @xmath45 increases .",
    "trusting in n - body simulations we expect that the larger srsic index of s0 s and e s at each mass could be originated through a series of major / minor merging events experienced by a spiral galaxy .",
    "ram pressure and evaporation can not in fact drastically change the srsic index of a galaxy . a redistribution or an accretion of new stars",
    "is required to produce the observed variations , in particular of the bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "the transforming galaxies should therefore experience such merging events or should produce new stars in their bulges .",
    "@xcite came to a similar conclusion in their analysis of the mass functions and morphological mix of the wings and ediscs data .",
    "they stressed that it is impossible to reconcile the mass function observed at low redshift only with the evolution of the morphological fractions .",
    "mass accretion events and new infalling galaxies are required to reproduce the observed evolution .",
    "they believe that new sf events should occur in the transforming galaxies .    a robust hint that merging events and gravitational interactions are responsible of the observed @xmath155 relation would be the detection of a systematic change of @xmath45 in galaxies that potentially might be subject to several encounters .",
    "we have seen before that the center of clusters , where the density of galaxies and the velocity dispersion is high , host the more massive objects ( a factor of @xmath4 larger in mass ) as well as the smaller in size ( @xmath109 smaller , with the notable exception of the bcgs ) .",
    "this difference can not be explained in the context of ram pressure stripping and evaporation by a hot igm , but fits with the idea that a series of merging events and strong gravitational interactions have produced the big s0 s that are now seen in the cluster center .    in order to test such hypothesis",
    ", we examined the behavior of the srsic index of the three morphological classes in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] . here for each class we plotted the mean galaxy mass and srisc index observed in two intervals of cluster - centric distance @xmath156 ( black dots and gray strips ) and @xmath157 ( red dots and blue strips ) .",
    "the figure shows that there is only a marginal evidence of an increase of @xmath45 for the s0 s in the cluster central region .",
    "the probability that the observed means are different by chance is @xmath158 and the observed variation is very small . on the other hand the figure shows that inner and outer e s have significantly different values of @xmath45 . in particular the inner e s have systematically lower @xmath45 than outer objects .",
    "the statistical significance that the two samples have different averages by chance is now @xmath159 .",
    "this means that e s in the central region of the clusters are likely subject to tidal stripping ( galaxy harassment ) , i.e. the most external stars are lost producing less extended envelopes and consequently lower measured @xmath45 .",
    "spirals on the other hand remain the same at every distance inside the clusters .",
    "one might speculate that the variations of @xmath45 could not be associated with a real change of the bulge structure since gasphot is a software that provides the srsic index for the whole galaxy and not for the bulge component .",
    "for this reason we used again the subsample of galaxies of sanchez - jannsen , which contains the bulge - to - disk decomposition of our galaxies .",
    "[ fig17 ] confirms that : 1 ) there is a systematic variation between the srsic index of the bulges of the various morphological types ; 2 ) the mean difference between the b / t ratios of s0 s and spirals increases in the inner region of the clusters ; 3 ) the mean difference in the srsic index also increases .    in conclusion we can say that we have only a marginal indication that the s0 s bulges are systematically bigger in the central region of the clusters as a consequence of major / minor merging events , but in general the data do not support the idea that merging events are more frequent in the inner region of clusters with respect to the outskirts .",
    "the question is therefore when and where the transforming spirals acquire the new stars that complete the transition to the s0 class systematically increasing their bulge structures .    up to now",
    "several works have already claimed that the main quenching and morphological transformation do not occur primarily in the cores of clusters , at least not at @xmath160 .",
    "the decrease in sf is already visible at several virial radii @xcite , and the s0 fraction increases since @xmath161 @xcite particularly in less - massive clusters @xcite .",
    "the evolution driven by the environment seems to occur at intermediate densities and outside the cluster virial radius and such effects are observed in simulations out to as many as five virial radii @xcite .",
    "this open the possibility that pre - processing mechanisms affect the infalling galaxy population .",
    "the emerging scenario from the above discussion is that spirals start to quench their sf when they enter in the hot igm , but at the same time when they are still in the cluster outskirts they progressively accrete / merge new material changing the structure of their bulge and disk ( thick disks ? ) .",
    "one possibility is that the spirals which end up in today s0 s , were members of small groups infalling the clusters and subsequently merged together .",
    "in other words from the present sample we can only derive indirect hints that merging events have contributed to the formation of today s0 s .",
    "this il likely due to the fact that the present data cover only the inner virialized part of the wings clusters .",
    "probably the ongoing observations of the outskirts of the wings clusters will provide soon much solid conclusions about this .",
    "an intriguing fact that is difficult to explain with the ram pressure is that the clusters with a small value of the @xmath8 ratio ( @xmath162 ) seem to contain in their central region systematically more massive s0 s than clusters with a higher value of this ratio ( see left panel of fig .",

    "the right panel of the same figure shows that there are no systematic differences in the mass distributions of the various morphological types in clusters with @xmath171 and @xmath172 suggesting that the observed behavior is not the result of a selection bias , but is probably an intrinsic characteristic of galaxies of these two types of clusters .    at the end of this section",
    "we should say that we have accumulated several hints , although none strictly compelling , that merging events and gravitational interactions ( harassment ? ) have had a role in galaxy clusters ( in particular in those with low velocity dispersions ) .",
    "one of the most relevant things of the previous analysis is that e s in the central region are systematically deprived of their outer stars with respect to more distant objects .",
    "this tell us that gravitational stripping and galaxy harassment are playing an active role in the high density regions of clusters .",
    "galaxy harassment may be associated with the origin of a diffuse stellar component that yields the so - called intra - cluster optical light ( @xcite ) , if this diffuse component is due to stars tidally stripped from galaxies as they move within the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to test this effect we compare now the properties of the three morphological classes for objects belonging to the general field and to clusters .",
    "we have therefore used the pm2gc data sample described in sec .",
    "[ sec1c ] .",
    "[ fig20 ] shows the comparison of the srsic index and the effective radius of the three morphological types for galaxies in clusters ( black dots and gray strips ) and in the field ( red dots and blue strips ) .",
    "the left panel tells us that spirals in clusters and in the field have exactly the same @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "s0 s and e s in clusters appear systematically with lower @xmath45 values at each mass .",
    "we have checked with a welch s test that this difference is significative from a statistical point of view and can not originate from the different wavebands ( b and v ) of the two datasets .",
    "the mean difference that can be attributed to the waveband effect is of the order of @xmath173 for @xmath174)$ ] and @xmath175 for @xmath176 $ ] .",
    "the right panel confirms that the higher srsic index of galaxies in the field is associated to a systematic variation of the circularized effective radius .",
    "field galaxies are systematically larger than cluster objects , suggesting that the main visible action of the cluster environment is the stripping of the outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the main indication is that the mean e s and s0 s of intermediate mass in the field have larger @xmath45 ( @xmath158 ) and larger @xmath43 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "one possibility is that during the infall into the cluster potential , or as a consequence of repeated high speed encounters , galaxies loose their outer regions .",
    "this produces systematically smaller radii and also smaller srsic indexes for the galaxies in clusters .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the @xmath155 relation of field and cluster galaxies suggests that the mechanisms that have produced the various morphological classes should be very similar in both environments .",
    "if ram pressure and evaporation were not active in the field , the only possible hypotheses are that field s0 s originated from spirals that were members of small groups that are now dissolved , or in binary associations .",
    "part of these objects could also be byproduct of a secular evolution of the disk .",
    "in other words the merging hypothesis is still one the most attractive even for field s0 s .",
    "in this work we have obtained the following results :    1 .",
    "the fractions s0/sp and e / sp derived for clusters at different redshifts smoothly increase from @xmath88 to the present , while the fraction s0/e remains almost constant ( or is only slightly increasing ) although with a significative variance .",
    "in particular the fraction s0/sp is nearly double every gyr ; 2 .",
    "starting from the mean number of morphological types observed in ediscs and ending to those measured in wings , we calculated a mean rate of transformation of spirals into s0 s of @xmath178 objects per gyr ( not considering the infall of new spiral objects in the clusters ) , while the mean transformation of spirals into e s is at least @xmath4 objects per gyr ; 3 .",
    "the s0 population in clusters appears to grow at the expenses of the spiral one by a factor of @xmath2 since @xmath179 . at the same time",
    "the number of e s could not remain constant ; 4 .",
    "s0 s are more frequent in the central region of nearby clusters , while spirals are preferentially found in the outer regions of high redshift clusters ; 5 .",
    "the s0 family at @xmath180 is on average quite different from that of present day spirals : in general at a given distance from the cluster center they are more massive ( up to a factor of 2 ) , @xmath181 smaller in size , with an higher srsic index and effective surface brightness , and are redder in b@xmath63v colors . on the other hand , at a given mass they are closer to the center , systematically smaller in size , with higher surface brightness , age , color and srsic index , but lower sfr ; 6 .   the more massive s0 s in wings are clustered around the center of the clusters ; 7 .",
    "the s0 s in ediscs have the same structural characteristics of present day s0 s once a passive luminosity evolution is taken into account . as for the wings clusters",
    "e s and s0 s are more frequent in the central part of the clusters , but the proportion of the morphological types is quite different ; 8 .",
    "the mass distribution of present day s0 s and high redshift spirals is very similar ( although in the limited range of galaxy masses @xmath182 ) ; 9 .",
    "the morphological fractions s0/sp and e / sp in the local wings sample are mildly correlated with the x - ray luminosity of the clusters and with the cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "the objects closer to the cluster center are systematically deprived of their gas .",
    "the more massive s0 s reside in the clusters with the smaller velocity dispersion ; 10 . the srsic index of spirals , s0 s and e s increase with the mass of the galaxies and in particular with the bulge component",
    "at each mass the value of @xmath45 is large for e s , intermediate for s0 s and small for spirals ; 11 .",
    "pairwise merger simulations give some support to the idea that the most massive cluster s0s may arise by merging ; 12 .",
    "there are no clear indications of an increase of the srsic index for galaxies closer to the cluster center with respect to more distant objects , with the possible exception of central e s ( bcgs excluded ) that appear to have systematically lower @xmath45 of far e s ; 13 .",
    "the comparison between cluster and field galaxies tells us that galaxies in clusters are systematically smaller in effective radius and have lower @xmath45 values .",
    "the first four points of this list strongly suggest that spirals transform into s0 s and e s in clusters .",
    "the fifth and seventh points confirm that s0 s and spirals are very different in many observable parameters at all redshifts .",
    "if we accept the idea that spirals transform into s0 s , we should recognize that the morphological transformation is radical .",
    "the speed of the transformation should be quite fast , since the various surveys at different redshifts have clearly identified the three morphological classes with almost no objects with confused or mixed morphology .",
    "the eighth point suggests that the mass distribution of present day s0 s and spiral is consistent ( at least for the large masses ) with the hypothesis of transformation through gas stripping and quenching of sf .",
    "however , within this scenario it is quite difficult to account for the large observed difference in the srsic index among the progenitor spiral and the final s0 galaxy .    the ninth point tell us that the hot igm certainly play a key role in the transformation because the clusters having a bright x - ray luminosity contain proportionally more e s and s0 s with respect to spirals .",
    "however , the same point tell us that the clusters with the smaller velocity dispersion contains the biggest s0 s in agreement with the idea that merger events have produced these galaxies .",
    "the activity of merging and gravitational interactions is suggested by points 3 , 10 and 13 .",
    "the main hints that s0 s could originate from merging events ( if we accept the idea that spirals must transform ) , rest on : a ) the fact that up to @xmath183 at each distance form the cluster center the mean spirals are systematically less massive than the mean s0 s and e s ; b ) in the same interval the mean e s are more massive than the mean s0 s and the most massive are progressively segregated in the central region ; c ) the srsic index is predicted to evolve after merging and is observed to increase systematically with the mass of the spheroidal component ( and marginally decrease with the distance from the cluster center ) .",
    "the twelfth point indicates that the merging activity is not confined to the densest regions of the clusters , but can occur in every place and time inside them , in particular in the outer cluster regions , where the velocity dispersion slow down .",
    "we can therefore speculate that when small groups fell into the cluster potential they merged together forming the new s0 s and e s we see today .",
    "the thirteenth point suggests that the main action of the cluster environment is that of stripping stars from the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "all the morphological types in clusters appear in fact to be systematically smaller in size and with lower srsic index with respect to field objects .",
    "this effect of harassment is not in contradiction with the idea that merging is the main actor of the spiral transformation .",
    "the merging hypothesis is currently supported by recent observations of massive s0 s located in groups and clusters , usually exhibiting traces of past merger events @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high resolution analysis of the atlas3d group @xcite has found that 87% of the galaxies classified as s0 s or e s at very low redshifts are fast rotating systems , indicating that they have rotationally supported disks .",
    "slow rotators are the most massive galaxies , often with boxy isophotes ( 70% of them ) , and depletion of mass in the central galaxy regions ( core ) . fast rotators are less massive , typically have disky isophotes , and centrally peaked surface brightness profiles ( cuspy ) .",
    "fast rotators are presumably stripped spirals with some mass added by minor mergers , whereas the slow rotators are formed in more violent processes so that the bulges formed first .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with other well known observations : 1 ) stellar and gaseous disks , and dust lanes have been frequently found in e s and s0 bulges ; 2 ) shells and ripples are often seen around these galaxies when deep exposures are taken ; 3 ) lenticular galaxies surrounded by polar rings exist ; 4 ) early - type galaxies could evolve in size by multiple minor merging events ( see _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "all these facts together point toward a strong role of merging in re - structuring the morphology of late - type galaxies .",
    "this is supported by modern high resolution simulations of merging events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between two spiral galaxies that have produced e s and s0 s with some rotational support with the right coupled bulge - disk structures in time scale less than @xmath25 3 gyr @xcite .",
    "a major merging could completely transform the structure of a spiral galaxy , varying its bulge - to - disk ratio , its srsic index , the mean surface brightness and the effective radius ( see _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "minor mergers can also produce s0 s with intermediate kinematic properties between fast and slow rotators that are difficult to explain with major mergers @xcite . in conclusion the bulges of s0 s",
    "can be formed by means of a major merger of early disks or by a sequence of minor merger events , followed by a later disk rebuilding of the left - over gas and stripped stars @xcite .",
    "the data presented here are consistent with this scenario , although there are only hints that this was the right story for the s0 in clusters .",
    "direct evidences exist that ram pressure stripping and thermal evaporation could rapidly quench the sf in spiral galaxies , while internal secular evolution can re - distribute the matter within them .",

    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    we discuss the observational evidences of the morphological transformation of spirals into s0 galaxies in the cluster environment exploiting two big databases of galaxy clusters : wings ( @xmath0 ) and ediscs ( @xmath1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important results are : 1 ) the average number of s0 galaxies in clusters is almost a factor of @xmath2 larger today than at redshift @xmath3 ; 2 ) the fraction of s0 s to spirals increases on average by a factor @xmath4 every gyr ; 3 ) the average rate of transformation for spirals ( not considering the infall of new galaxies from the cosmic web ) is : @xmath5 sp@xmath6s0 s per gyr and @xmath7 sp@xmath6e s per gyr ; 4 ) there are evidences that the interstellar gas of spirals is stripped by an hot intergalactic medium ; 5 ) there are also indirect hints that major / minor merging events have played a role in the transformation of spiral galaxies .    in particular , we show that : 1 ) the ratio between the number of s0 s and spirals ( @xmath8 ) in the wings clusters is correlated with their x - ray luminosity @xmath9 ; 2 ) that the brightest and massive s0 s are always close to the cluster center ; 3 ) that the mean srsic index of s0 s is always larger than that of spirals ( and lower than e s ) for galaxy stellar masses above @xmath10 ; 4 ) that the number of e s in clusters can not be constant ; 5 ) that the largest difference between the mean mass of s0 s and e s with respect to spirals is observed in clusters with low velocity dispersion .    finally , by comparing the properties of the various morphological types for galaxies in clusters and in the field , we find that the most significant effect of the environment is the stripping of the outer galaxy regions , resulting in a systematic difference in effective radius and srsic index . </S>"
