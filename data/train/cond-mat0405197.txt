    "the examples considered there support our predictions about the critical exponents .",
    "a more recent comparison with experimental data very close to the @xmath16transition point @xmath17 in liquid helium has been made in  @xcite .",

    "@xmath26 the predicted possible values of the critical exponents are  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are integers .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath14symmetric @xmath13 model belongs to the same universality class as the corresponding lattice model ( ising model at @xmath30 , @xmath31 model at @xmath32 , the classical heisenberg model at @xmath33 , etc . ) , where the order parameter is an @xmath21-component vector ( spin ) with fixed modulus @xmath34 , since the latter is a particular case ( @xmath35 at @xmath36 or @xmath37 in the notations used in  @xcite ) of the lattice @xmath13 model , where the gradient term is represented by finite differences  @xcite . besides , the partition functions and two  point correlation functions of both @xmath13 model in  @xcite and ising model can be represented by similar functional integrals  @xcite .",

    "this is a special case , not related to  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and  ( [ eq : nu ] ) , where two expansion parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the deviation from the critical temperature @xmath51 , are replaced by one parameter @xmath49 .",

    "these exponents are recovered at any @xmath61 and @xmath62 in  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and  ( [ eq : nu ] ) when approaching the upper critical dimension @xmath63 from below .",
    "our formulae do not provide any sensible result approaching @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is expected at @xmath30 according to the midgal s approximation  @xcite .",
    "it can be understood from the point of view  @xcite that @xmath66 , probably , is the marginal value of @xmath67 , such that an analytic continuation of the results from @xmath67-dimensional hypercubes can be only formal and has no physical meaning at @xmath68 . in this sense , we expect that @xmath69 is a special dimension for any @xmath70 . besides , the critical temperature does not vanish at @xmath71 , and for @xmath30 there exist lattices for which the critical temperature is nonzero at the fractal dimension below 2  @xcite . in the marginal case @xmath69 different behavior is observed at low temperatures : the long  range order at @xmath30 , the kosterlitz  thouless structural order at @xmath32 , and disordered state at @xmath72 .",
    "our concept agrees with the known rigorous results for @xmath31 model  @xcite .",
    "it disagrees with the prediction of the perturbative rg theory  @xcite that the critical temperature goes to zero at @xmath71 for the @xmath73symmetric nonlinear @xmath74 model and , therefore , the behavior in this case is gaussian , i.  e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the results of the perturbative rg theory are not rigorous since the claims are based on formal expansions which break down in relevant limits , in this case at vanishing external field @xmath77 . moreover ,",
    "essential claims of this theory are based on an evidently incorrect mathematical treatment .",
    "in particular , the conclusion about the gaussian character of the @xmath14symmetric @xmath13 model below @xmath51 has been made in  @xcite by simply rewritting the hamiltonian in an apparently gaussian form ( see eqs .  (",
    "3.4 ) to  ( 3.6 ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "the author , however , forgot to include the determinant of the transformation jacobian in the relevant functional integrals , according to which the resulting model all the same is not gaussian .",
    "due to the reasons mentioned above , we do not believe in predictions of the perturbative rg theory , but rely only on exact and rigorous results .",
    "there exists a simple non  perturbative explanation why the critical temperature should stay finite at @xmath71 for the @xmath14symmetric heisenberg model .",
    "below @xmath51 , the difference in free energies for models with antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions along one axis is @xmath78 , where @xmath2 is the linear size of the system and @xmath79 is the helicity modulus .",
    "it holds because the energy difference in the ground state at @xmath80 is @xmath81 , corresponding to gradually rotated spins in any given plane .",
    "the factor @xmath79 takes into account the temperature dependence .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath82 .",
    "hence , the factor @xmath83 always vanishes at @xmath68 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath84 , therefore the long  range order ( if it would exist ) could be destroyed in this case at any finite temperature by gradually rotating the spins without increasing the free energy .",
    "thus , the long  range order disappears at @xmath68 irrespective to the behavior of @xmath79 , i.  e. , irrespective to the value of @xmath51 at @xmath85 .",
    "in such a way , the assumption that the critical temperature should go to zero continuously appears as an additional unnecessary constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "if the critical temperature remains finite in @xmath13 model , then @xmath86 should be positive at @xmath87 to avoid the divergence of @xmath88 at @xmath89 , where @xmath90 with @xmath91 holds for the two  point correlation function .",
    "the expectation @xmath92 agrees with  ( [ eq : expo1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : expo2 ] ) .",
    "however , the critical temperature at @xmath85 and @xmath86 tend to zero in the limit @xmath93 to coincide with the known exact results for the spherical model , which are recovered in  ( [ eq : expo1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : expo2 ] ) at @xmath94 . in the present analysis the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath95 for the susceptibility is also relevant .",

    "@xcite , but , according to the final result represented by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and  ( [ eq : nu ] ) , @xmath105 is a natural number . some of the expansion coefficients can be zero , so that in general we have @xmath106 where @xmath107 may have integer values 1 , 2 , 3 , etc",
    ". one can expect that @xmath108 holds at @xmath30 ( which yields @xmath109 at @xmath69 and @xmath110 at @xmath111 ) and the only nonvanishing corrections are those of the order @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , since the known corrections to scaling for physical quantities , such as magnetization or correlation length , are analytical in the case of the two  dimensional ising model . here",
    "we suppose that the confluent corrections become analytical , i.  e. @xmath95 takes the value @xmath115 , at @xmath69 . besides , similar corrections to scaling are expected for susceptibility @xmath116 and magnetization @xmath117 since both these quantities",
    "are related to @xmath118 , i.  e. , @xmath97 and @xmath119 hold where @xmath120 is the volume and @xmath2 is the linear size of the system .",
    "the above limit is meaningful at @xmath84 , but @xmath121 may be considered as a definition of @xmath122 for finite systems too .",
    "the latter means that corrections to finite ",
    "size scaling for @xmath116 and @xmath117 are similar at @xmath89 . according to the scaling hypothesis and finite ",
    "size scaling theory , the same is true for the discussed here corrections at @xmath101 , where in both cases ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) the definition @xmath123 is valid .",
    "thus , the expected expansion of the susceptibility @xmath116 looks like @xmath124 . in this discussion",
    "we have omitted the irrelevant for critical behaviour background term in the susceptibility , which is constant in the first approximation and comes from the short  distance contribution to @xmath125  @xcite , where @xmath126 is the real  space two  point correlation function .",
    "our hypothesis is that @xmath127 and @xmath128 monotoneously increase with @xmath21 to fit the known exponents for the spherical model at @xmath93 .",
    "the analysis of the mc and experimental results here and in  @xcite enables us to propose that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath38 hold at least at @xmath131 .",
    "these relations , probably , are true also at @xmath132 .",
    "this general hypothesis is consistent with the idea that the critical exponents @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath95 can be represented by some analytical functions of @xmath21 which are valid for all natural positive @xmath21 and yield @xmath133 rather than @xmath134 with @xmath135 ( @xmath136 must be a natural number to avoid a contradiction , i.  e. , irrational values of @xmath137 at natural @xmath21 ) at @xmath93 . at these conditions , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are linear functions of @xmath21 ( with integer coefficients ) such that @xmath139 at @xmath93 , and @xmath61 is constant . besides , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 hold to coincide with the known results at @xmath30 . then",
    ", our specific choice is the best one among few possibilities providing more or less reasonable agreement with the actually discussed numerical an experimental results .",
    "we allow that different @xmath107 values correspond to the leading correction  to  scaling exponent for different quantities related to @xmath96 . according to  @xcite",
    ", the expansion of @xmath96 in @xmath13 model by itself contains a nonvanishing term of order @xmath143 ( in the form @xmath144 $ ] whith @xmath145 , since @xmath146 holds in the case of susceptibility ) to compensate the corresponding correction term ( produced by @xmath147 ) in the equation for @xmath148 ( cf .",

    "in particular , the critical green s ( correlation ) function @xmath154 of 2d ising model in @xmath155 crystallographic direction on an infinite lattice can be calculated easily based on the known exact formulae  @xcite , and it yields @xmath156 $ ] at large distances @xmath151 . nevertheless , our calculations in 2d  ising model discussed in sec .",

    "the thermodynamic limit is a particular case of the finite  size scaling with the scaling argument @xmath158 , therefore it is possible that the nontrivial corrections to the correlation function in 2d ising model vanish in this special case or in the crystallographic direction @xmath155 , but not in general .",
    "our consideration can be generalized easily to the case where the hamiltonian parameter @xmath23 is a nonlinear analytical function of @xmath24 .",

    "[ alfa ] are not of statistical character , since the statistical errors are remarkably smaller than the symbol size except only the largest @xmath2 value , where the error is about the symbol size . due to this reason we have used simple least  squares approximations , minimizing the sum of not weighted squared deviations .",

    "it is quite possible that the true value of @xmath692 is remarkably smaller than the rg value @xmath693 , as consistent with our recent results for the exponent @xmath10 .",
    "we have estimated @xmath694 from the derivatives of the binder cumulant @xmath695 ( see sec .  [",

    ".  [ beta ] , one may expect an accelerated further deviation from the perturbative rg value @xmath713 .",
    "thus , in spite of the conventional claims that the specific heat of 3d ising model has a certain power  like critical singularity , accurately predicted by the perturbative rg theory , the actual very accurate mc data for @xmath668 show that it is even more plausible that the singularity is logarithmic .",
    "there exists a large number of numerical results in the published literature not discussed here and in  @xcite .",
    "a detailed review of these results is given in  @xcite .",
    "the cited there papers report results which disagree with the values of the critical exponents we have proposed in  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the values of the perturbative rg theory are well confirmed by the ht series expansions  @xcite .",
    "however , we are somewhat sceptical about such a support of one perturbative method by another .",
    "it could well happen that the true reason for the agreement is the extrapolative nature of both methods , according to which both methods describe a transient behavior of the system far away from the true critical region .",
    "really , our simulations of the magnetization data within @xmath461 well confirm the rg value of the critical exponent @xmath172 , whereas the agreement becomes worse at @xmath714 , where the plot of the effective exponent shows a remarkable inflection thus indicating that the true critical region , where the critical exponents can be accurately measured , is @xmath715 .",
    "this region , of course , can not be directly accessed by the ht series expansions .",
    "another problem is that the ht estimation of the critical exponent @xmath332  @xcite is based on a priori assumption that the singularity of specific heat is power  like , whereas the mc data ( sec .",
    "[ sec : alfa ] ) suggest that it , very likely , is logarithmic .    according to the finite  size scaling theory",
    ", @xmath716 is a relevant scaling argument , so that not too small values of the reduced temperature @xmath102 are related to not too large system sizes @xmath717 .",
    "thus , according to the idea proposed above , it is quite possible that the mc results for finite systems , like also the simulations at finite @xmath102 values , appear to be in a good agreement with the conventional rg exponents which are valid within a certain range of @xmath102 and @xmath2 values well accessible in mc simulations .",
    "the huge number of numerical evidences in the published literature ( see  @xcite ) for the exponents of the perturbative rg theory certainly is a serious argument .",
    "nevertheless , there is a reason to worry about the validity of these exponents at @xmath101 and/or @xmath84 because of the following problems .",
    "* we have made accurate mc simulations of the magnetization ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mag ] ) for unusually large system syzes ( @xmath6 ) much closer to the critical point ( @xmath5 instead of @xmath461 ) than in the published literature , and have found that the agreement with the rg exponent @xmath172 becomes worse in this case .",
    "* our mc estimation of the exponent @xmath10 , discussed at the end of sec .  [ sec : alfa ] , shows a good agreement with the rg value @xmath11 at not too large system sizes .",
    "however , the agreement becomes worse when larger than @xmath718 sizes are included . * a remarkable deviation of the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath276 from the perturbative rg value @xmath719",
    "has been already reported in literature  @xcite , where also larger than usually system sizes @xmath720 ( instead of the conventional @xmath721  @xcite ) have been simulated in application to the monte carlo renormalization group techniques , yielding @xmath722 . *",
    "the confirmation of rg exponents by mc simulations is not unambiguous .",
    "there exist also examples where the simulation results are in a remarkable disagreement with these exponents even within the conventionally considered range of sizes and reduced temperatures .",
    "a particular example is the finite  size scaling of the maximal values of the specific heat considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : alfa ] .",
    "we are afraid that there are also other such examples , but they are routinely ascribed as unbelievable and do not appear in the published literature . *",
    "it is indeed easy to produce evidences supporting the rg exponents , as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : mag ] , just because these exponents describe the behavior of a system not too close to criticality , in the range which can be easily accessed in mc simulations .",
    "the problem is that the usual mc measurements yield only effective exponents , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : test ] , which exhibit quite large variations also in 3d case , as it is particularly well seen from our plots of the effective exponents .",
    "the leading correction  to  scaling term , included in the fitted ansatz , also does not completely solve the problem : in essence it is the same as to make a linear extrapolation of the effective exponent , but , e.  g. , the @xmath7 plots in fig .",
    "[ beta ] are remarkably nonlinear .",
    "therefore , only such evidences are really serious , which show very precisely how the effective exponents provided by simple estimations converge to certain asymptotic values .",
    "if one consider seriously a possibility that the true values of the critical exponents are those proposed in  @xcite , then a question arises why the published mc estimates tend to deviate greatly from these theoretical values . in our opinion",
    ", the main reason is that the published simulations have been made too far away from the true critical region ( as regards both @xmath102 and @xmath2 ) , where the critical exponents can be precisely measured in a simple way routinely used in mc analysis .",
    "the plots of the effective exponents in fig .  [ beta ]",
    "provide an evidence for this statement : as we have already mentioned ( sec .",
    "[ sec : test ] ) , simple mc measurements yield just such effective exponents , and they are varied .",
    "one has to consider corrections to scaling , and not only the leading one , to get better results .",
    "however , all the existing ( mc ) correction  to  scaling analyses in the published literature rely on the rg correction  to  scaling exponents , therefore the disagreement with the predictions in  @xcite is not surprising .    finally , our theory provides a self consistent explanation why much smaller @xmath102 values and/or much larger system syzes @xmath2 has to be considered , as compared to the known simulations .",
    "it is because the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath723 in our theory is remarkably smaller than that of the rg theory @xmath719 , which implies that the decay of corrections to scaling is relatively slow .",
    "in fact , the reduced temperatures we have reached in our simulations of the magnetization also are still much too large for an accurate estimation of the critical exponent @xmath172 in the right  hand  side picture in fig .",
    "nevertheless , we can see that the qualitative behavior , at least , is just such as expected from our theory .",
    "summarizing the present work we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "critical exponents and corrections to scaling for different physical quantities have been discussed in framework of our  @xcite recently developed gfd ( grouping of feynman diagrams ) theory ( sec .",
    "[ sec : crex ] ) .",
    "2 .   calculation of the two  point correlation function of 2d ising model at the critical point has been made numerically by exact transfer matrix algorithms ( secs .",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] and  [ sec : correc ] ) .",
    "the results for finite lattices including up to 800 spins have shown the existence of a nontrivial correction to finite ",
    "size scaling with a very small amplitude and exponent about @xmath724 , as it can be expected from our gfd theory .",
    "accurate monte carlo simulations of the magnetization of 3d ising model have been performed by wolff s algorithm in the range of the reduced temperatures @xmath5 and system sizes @xmath6 to evaluate the effective critical exponent @xmath7 based on the finite  size scaling .",
    "estimates extracted from the data relatively far away from the critical point , within @xmath461 , well confirm the value @xmath725 of the perturbative rg theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the effective exponent tends to increase above this value when approaching @xmath51 .",
    "a self consistent extrapolation does not reveal a contradiction with the prediction @xmath511 of the gfd theory  @xcite , although there is still a large gap between the simulated and extrapolated values .",
    "the convergence of @xmath513 to the value of gfd theory @xmath726 has been observed experimentally in ni  @xcite , where the asymptotic value @xmath727 has been found .",
    "an iterative method has been proposed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : alfa ] ) which allows a direct simulation of the maximal values of the specific heat , depending on the system size @xmath2 .",
    "the simulated data for 3d ising model within @xmath728 apparently show a better agreement with the logarithmic critical singularity of the specific heat predicted in  @xcite ( and consistent with our result @xmath334 ) than with the specific power  like singularity proposed by the perturbative rg theory  @xcite .",
