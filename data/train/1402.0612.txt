    "cosmic magnetic fields are interesting topics for modern astrophysics and cosmology , because magnetic fields could affect the formation of cosmic structures and imprint themselves on histories and properties of cosmic evolutions .",
    "for example , magnetic fields are essential for instabilities in galactic gaseous disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , play crucial roles in structures , particle accelerations , and radio emissions in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , record evolutions of turbulence in the cosmic web ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and affect cosmic ray or @xmath0-ray propagation such as pair echo @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation , the rotation of the polarization angle of electromagnetic waves traveling in magnetized plasma , is a standard tool to measure galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields @xcite . for a line of sight ( los ) toward a single polarized source , faraday rotation can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wavelength , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the rotation angles at the observer and the source , respectively , and @xmath5 is the faraday depth or faraday rotation measure ( rm ) which is an integration of the los component of magnetic fields from the source to the observer with a weight of electron density . notice that `` faraday depth '' does not correlate with physical distance of source and sign which shows the direction of magnetic field toward observer dramatically changes the behavior of polarization angle and faraday dispersion function ( see section 2 ) .",
    "faraday depth can be estimated based on the linear relation between @xmath6 and @xmath3 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the estimation , however , becomes uncertain if there exists multiple sources within a beam , in the case @xmath6 and @xmath3 does not display a linear relation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this problem is generally inevitable in studies of extragalactic magnetic fields , since we observe extragalactic sources viewed through galactic emissions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need more sophisticated methods to diagnose polarized emissions and faraday depths along the los",
    ".    one of the sophisticated methods is so - called rm synthesis or faraday tomography proposed in radio astronomy @xcite , which has been applied by many authors @xcite .",
    "this method transforms polarization spectra as a function of wavelength into those as a function of faraday depth .",
    "for example , @xcite analyzed point sources with faraday tomography and spectral fitting with faraday rotation models .",
    "they found that some of their polarization spectra could not be fitted with a single - source model but are well fitted with a multiple - source model .",
    "this means that they resolved the point sources by their polarization spectra .",
    "this demonstrates that faraday tomography is effective for cases with multiple sources within a single beam .",
    "since the quality of faraday tomography primarily depends on frequency coverage of the data , faraday tomography is expected to become a major tool of radio polarimetry using future facilities such as square kilometer array ( ska ) .",
    "recently , however , @xcite reported some ambiguities associated with faraday tomography .",
    "they considered two sources located very closely each other in faraday depth , and varied the difference of intrinsic polarization angles of the two sources .",
    "they found that faraday tomography could resolve two components correctly in some cases but , in other cases , it erroneously detected three components including false signals .",
    "this phenomenon , called rm ambiguity , would substantially degrade faraday tomography unless we understand it .    in this paper , we extend the previous work and examine the conditions of the appearance of false signals more systematically .",
    "we investigate the dependence of false signals on intrinsic polarization angles , rotation measures , and intensities of the two sources .",
    "we also change frequency coverage based on planned observations with australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) and ska . in section 2 , we describe our model and calculations .",
    "we study the conditions of false signals in section 3 , and give a summary and discussion in section 4 .",
    "we follow a basic formula of faraday tomography described by @xcite and summarized by @xcite and @xcite . we start with the polarized intensity , as an observable quantity , which is a complex function in the square of the wavelength : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the polarization degree , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the stokes parameters .",
    "@xmath12 is the faraday dispersion function ( fdf ) , which is a complex polarized intensity as a function of faraday depth .",
    "the last equation can be inverted as @xmath13    the fdf is hence obtained from the polarized intensity , though its reconstruction is not perfect because negative @xmath6 is unphysical and observable wavelengths are limited .",
    "we introduce the window function @xmath14 which has nonzero value at observed @xmath6 and zero elsewhere including negative @xmath6 . the observed complex polarized intensity and the reconstructed fdf",
    "can be written as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , where we used the convolution theorem and @xmath17 indicates convolution .",
    "@xmath18 is the rotation measure spread function ( rmsf ) , which is defined with the inverse fourier transform of @xmath14",
    ".    equation ( [ eq5 ] ) indicates that the quality of reconstruction of @xmath12 is determined by @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the rmsfs , where the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is determined by the observed wavelength as @xmath20 for a single continuous and uniform weighting band , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the largest and shortest wavelengths of the observations , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we test the cases for askap and ska .",
    "the fwhm is 22.26 rad / m@xmath24 for askap and 0.189 rad m@xmath25 for ska , based on the proposed frequency coverage listed in table [ tab1 ] .    due to finite width of frequency coverage , we see in figure [ f1 ] that the rmsf has sidelobes , and thus the reconstructed fdf obtained from equation ( [ eq5 ] ) has artificial fringes due to the sidelobes . to remove them ,",
    "we employ rm clean ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rm clean is an algorithm similar to the clean deconvolution developed for reconstruction of images obtained using a aperture synthesis radio telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we perform rm clean as follows .",
    "first , we seek the peak value of the reconstructed fdf at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and add a new clean component with its peak value multiplied by @xmath0 into a clean component list . here",
    "@xmath0 is the gain factor and we adopt @xmath28 .",
    "second , we subtract the shifted - scaled rmsf , @xmath29 , from the reconstructed fdf .",
    "third , we repeat the above two steps until the @xmath27 becomes below 1/1000 of the peak intensity of the model or until number of iterations is beyond 3000 . forth",
    ", we accumulate clean components and multiply the accumulated clean components by a clean beam . here , the clean beam is a gaussian beam with the fwhm of the rmsf .",
    "the multiplied fdf is called the cleaned fdf . finally , we add the residual of the reconstructed fdf to the cleaned fdf .",
    "the source model we adopted is the one studied by farnsworth et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in the model",
    ", we consider two polarized sources within a single beam .",
    "the two sources are approximated as faraday thin , emitters inside which rms are negligible , and are described as delta functions in @xmath12 .",
    "we do not specify real situations , but the model is rather general in the sense that two faraday thin sources are located at certain faraday depths such as radio lobes / cores ( farnsworth et al .",
    "the complex polarized intensity can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the polarized intensity , @xmath32 the intrinsic polarization angle , and @xmath33 is the faraday depth of the @xmath34-th source .",
    "we fix @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as reference values , and change @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 to systematically investigate properties of false signals through a number of case studies .",
    "the difference of the intrinsic polarization angles , @xmath41 is , thus , equal to @xmath42 . although @xmath43 should have a value between @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ", it should be symmetric for @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we consider only positive @xmath43s . also , the difference of faraday depths , @xmath47 is equal to @xmath39 .",
    "[ f1 ] shows an example of the model fdf with @xmath48 and @xmath49 1.0 fwhm .",
    "it should be noted that the first source with @xmath50 is not necessarily located closer to the observer compared with the second one , because the faraday depth is not a monotonic function of the physical distance in general .",
    "hereafter , we do not take into account the noise in order to confirm that false signals are not coming from the noise effect but inherent in this method .",
    "in figures [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] , we show the results of faraday tomography and rm clean for the cases with different @xmath43 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 rad m@xmath25 ( 1.0 fwhm ) for the case with askap are fixed .",
    "the two components are correctly detected except for the cases with @xmath53 . in the cases with @xmath53 ,",
    "the reconstructed fdf has a single peak around the mean faraday depth of the two components and the clean components includes false signal larger than the correct signals .",
    "this phenomenon was reported by @xcite as rm ambiguity .",
    "one may think that the result should be symmetric with respect to @xmath54 , that is , the result should depend only on the absolute value of the @xmath55 . actually , this is not the case and the asymmetry comes from the relative sign of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite indicated that two sources with a close separation @xmath57 1.0 fwhm would be detected as a single , false source , which is actually confirmed with figure [ f3 ] . on the other hand",
    ", there has not been reported that false signals arise for the cases with @xmath58 sufficiently larger than the fwhm . in order to make clear the border of rm ambiguity , in the next subsection we study the cases with @xmath59 1.0 fwhm and do not consider the cases with @xmath60 1.0 fwhm .",
    "figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] show the fdfs for the cases with @xmath61 fwhm . here , for quantification , we define the false signals to be clean components arisen in faraday depth from @xmath62 to @xmath63 with an amplitude larger than half of that of the largest clean component . in all cases ,",
    "the reconstructed fdf and cleaned fdf have two peaks near the input faraday depth and the clean components located at the correct positions are dominant .",
    "however , false signals can be seen in the cases with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , false signals appear even for a source separation larger than the fwhm of the rmsf .    to understand how large separation is needed to avoid false signals , we investigate false signals for the cases with various values of @xmath58 , fixing the other parameters .",
    "for systematic displays , we show the rotation angles of light emitted by the second source ( @xmath66 ) as a sector shaped with a thick line shown in figure [ f6 ] , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the rotation angles for @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the first source .",
    "figure [ f7 ] summarize the results for @xmath69 fwhm .",
    "the red sectors represent the range of @xmath70 where false signals appear in the clean components .",
    "we find that false signals tend to appear when @xmath71 .",
    "this would be understandable because the resultant polarizations emitted from the two sources are similar each other in this case , and thus it is rather difficult to separate the both sources correctly .",
    "we also find that the range of @xmath42 which induces false signals does not become narrow monotonically as @xmath58 increases .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows the amplitude of the false signals for various @xmath58 and @xmath55 , where we use @xmath72 , instead of @xmath55 , defined as , @xmath73 we can see that the region in which we see false signals is along the black solid line , which is the track for the light satisfying @xmath74 emitted by the second source , i.e. false signals tend to appear when @xmath75 as seen in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "we can see that the false signals are larger than the correct signals for @xmath76 .",
    "the false signals become weaker for larger @xmath58 but continue to appear up to @xmath77 , while there is a gap in @xmath78 .",
    "the separation corresponding to the gap is equal to the location of the second peak of the rmsf ( figure [ f1 ] ) whose amplitude is about 20% of that of the main peak .",
    "thus , this gap is considered to be generated by the sidelobe , which enhances the other source and makes the detections easier , by accident .",
    "we next investigate the dependence of false signals on the intensity ratio between the two sources , @xmath79 .",
    "for each @xmath79 , we validate the appearance of false signals in the case with @xmath80 and @xmath81 fwhm then pick up the worst case .",
    "the appearance of false signals can be classified into three types .",
    "type ( i ) is that false signals appear for some intrinsic polarization angles and they are larger than the correct signals .",
    "type ( ii ) is that false signals appear for some intrinsic polarization angles and they are smaller than the correct signals . and type ( iii )",
    "is that there is no false signals for any intrinsic polarization angle .",
    "figure [ f9 ] shows the distribution of the three types .",
    "there is a tendency that larger @xmath79 reduces the generation of false signals and two sources can be successfully resolved even for a separation smaller than the fwhm of the rmsf if @xmath82 .",
    "it is seen that false signals are serious when the two sources have comparable intensities and the separation is about the fwhm .      finally , we change frequency coverage .",
    "figure [ f10 ] shows the results of the same analysis in figure [ f7 ] but for the proposed bandwidth of ska .",
    "we find that the results are very similar to the case of askap .",
    "thus , false signals are unavoidable regardless of the bandwidth , if we scaled @xmath5 separation by the fwhm of rmsf .",
    "we expect that false signals appear in the cases with a certain @xmath55 whenever @xmath58 is less than @xmath83 fwhm .",
    "faraday tomography combined with rm clean is a powerful method to investigate the distribution of polarized sources along the los .",
    "however , in the presence of multiple sources , large false signals can appear in the middle of the correct signals in @xmath5 space . in this paper",
    ", we studied the condition of the appearance of false signals , focusing on the difference in the intrinsic polarization angles , the separation in @xmath5 space and the intensity ratio .",
    "we simulated the observations of askap and ska assuming two polarized sources and found that false signals can appear for a separation as large as 1.5 fwhm of the rmsf and the false signals exceed the correct signals for a separation smaller than 1.1 fwhm .",
    "the intensity ratio is also a important factor and large ratio tends to reduce the rm ambiguity .",
    "it should be noted that these results does not depend on the bandwidth of the telescope so that even future wide - band observation would suffer from rm ambiguity .    it should be noted that an absolute value of @xmath58 for which we see false signals is decreased as decreasing the fwhm .",
    "more specifically , false signals arise for the relative rm smaller than 22.26 rad / m@xmath24 with askap , but than 0.189 rad / m@xmath24 with ska .",
    "therefore , false signals would become a minor issue in the ska era while we study rms of a few rad / m@xmath24 or larger .",
    "rm clean has three parameters , the gain factor @xmath0 , threshold intensity , and maximum iteration .",
    "we also have studied the cases with different parameters , and found that larger gain factor tends to slightly increase the range of @xmath43 where false signals arise . on the other hand ,",
    "threshold intensity and maximum iteration in this work are rather conservative values and the results were not changed significantly .",
    "note that threshold intensity is usually referred to rms noise level of the observations .",
    "therefore , if we study polarization sources with less than mjy , the threshold intensity in this work could reach the rms noise levels of askap and ska , and thus should increase the threshold . for such cases , we may need more careful arguments for the rm clean parameters .    finally , stokes qu - fitting is another powerful method to probe cosmic magnetism with polarization observation @xcite . in this method ,",
    "fitting of polarization spectrum is performed assuming a model of source distribution with free parameters .",
    "combination of qu - fitting and faraday tomography would be effective to identify and avoid rm ambiguity , and detect correct polarized sources .",
    "this possibility will be pursued elsewhere in near future .",
