    "in recent years , the magnitudes and origin of the magnetic coupling constants of the quasi - one - dimensional quantum spin system cugeo@xmath0 have been subject of a variety of papers @xcite .",
    "in particular , the anti - ferromagnetic first nearest neighbor coupling @xmath3 is unusually small - believed to arise from superexchange hopping paths forming cu - o(2)-cu angles @xmath5 close to @xmath6 , which is the goodenough - kanamori - anderson @xcite ( gka ) criterion for vanishing anti - ferromagnetic superexchange .",
    "some authors have suggested that the hopping paths are strongly modified by the influence of the ge atoms on the o(2 ) ions , because of the strong covalent ionic ge - o(2 ) bonds .",
    "@xcite other authors @xcite have obtained very strong variations of @xmath3 with the angle @xmath5 ; i.e. , have predicted very large spin - phonon coupling constants in this system , in contradiction to estimates based on the data of the spin - peierls transition .",
    "@xcite    very recently , werner , gros , and braden ( wgb ) have presented a detailed evaluation of experimental data , based on a variety of theoretical estimates , to derive the spin coupling to the four phonon modes involved in the spin peierls transition .",
    "@xcite in particular , they find a strong coupling to variations of the angle @xmath5 , and a relatively large coupling to the ge displacements .    in the present paper we use superexchange perturbation theory to evaluate the spin coupling constants between the magnetic ions and their modulations with atomic displacements .",
    "our method is an extension of earlier perturbative treatments .",
    "@xcite in particular , we include band - like oxygen ligand states , because there is significant direct o(2)-o(2 ) hopping in the chain . for our calculations ,",
    "we start from a hubbard - type hamiltonian with five d - orbitals @xmath7 per cu site and p - orbitals at the o ligand sites .",
    "the full number of d orbitals at the cu sites is considered in order to allow both for symmetry induced orbital mixing and for the possibility of ferromagnetic exchange coupling involving excited cu d levels . on the oxygen sites ,",
    "we include the splitting and mixing of the oxygen p - levels caused by the coulomb fields of the adjacent ions , in particular by ge .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss details of our model , in section iii we first discuss our choices of model parameters and then present the results for the spin - phonon coupling constants and for the pressure dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "concluding remarks are given at the end .",
    "the cu atoms form a linear chain along the cuo@xmath9 ribbons ( see fig .",
    "[ cugeo_ladder ] ) , where the oxygen atoms in the cuo@xmath9 plane are labeled o(2 ) , the apex oxygen atoms o(1 ) .",
    "we use a multi - band hubbard - like hamiltonian , where all electron - electron interaction takes place at the cu - site , for details see ref .  .",
    "we take five d - orbitals per cu atom ( sites @xmath10 , orbitals @xmath11 ) and 3 p - orbitals ( sites @xmath12 , orbitals @xmath13 ) per oxygen and use the hole picture .",
    "we allow p - d hopping @xmath14 between cu ions and next nearest oxygen atoms .",
    "also , oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath15 up to third nearest neighbors is included .",

    "electron - electron interactions at the ligand ions and between different sites are neglected .",
    "we will also use the approximation @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we note that although this hamiltonian does not yield the correct atomic multiplet spectrum , it is sufficiently general for our perturbative approach . in particular , it incorporates the possibility for a competing ferromagnetic coupling of spins .",
    "the main impact of the ge atoms on the electronic structure is to cause a significant crystal field splitting of the oxygen p atomic levels , @xcite this effect is approximated by a crystal field @xmath24 ( including non - diagonal terms ) .",
    "admixture of ge 4s , 4p hole states to the o p hole states appears to be rather small @xcite and thus is neglected here .",
    "changes of hopping integrals @xmath25 due to variations of inter - atomic distances away from the equilibrium separation are considered using relations like @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the respective equilibrium distance .",
    "the main difference to earlier perturbation theory calculations of spin coupling constants lies in the handling of the ligand ions .",
    "usually , the ligands are treated in the atomic limit ; i.e. , only those hopping processes are considered , which occur along the spin exchange paths . here",
    "we extend the method and include band - like ligand states .",
    "this extension is justified by the observation that o - o hopping integrals of considerable magnitude exist in the cuo@xmath9 ribbons , @xcite leading to o(2 ) p - band widths of several ev .",
    "as we investigate the spin coupling for finite size cuo@xmath9 clusters , we actually deal with a finite number of o(2 ) cluster states instead of the complete set of band states .",
    "our calculations are carried out in a sequence of three steps .",
    "first , the oxygen cluster states are determined .",
    "as mentioned above , only o(2 ) p - orbitals are considered in the one - particle model .",
    "input are o(2)-o(2 ) hopping integrals , bare o(2 ) p - orbital energies and the crystal field caused by the adjacent ions .",
    "the cluster states are then obtained by diagonalizing the cluster hamiltonian , using up to 16 o(2 ) atoms and periodic boundary conditions . in a second step , environmentally adapted cu one - particle levels are determined .",
    "this calculation is carried out by coupling the atomic cu levels ( which are fivefold degenerate ) of a single cu atom to the o(2 ) cluster and also to the apical o(1 ) atoms . here , the additional input are the p - d level separation and the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 hopping integrals . the coupling is calculated in second order perturbation theory and leads to an effective on - site d - d hopping matrix , which is then diagonalized .",
    "we note that a rather similar d - level ordering ( with respect to both d character and separation ) can be obtained using coulomb - type ligand fields . in the third step , the adapted cu d - levels",
    "are then used to calculate the spin coupling constants by usual fourth order superexchange perturbation theory , yet the cu spins are transferred via the o cluster states instead of atomic ligand states . as the cluster ( or band ) states are delocalized , one might expect that the interaction between the magnetic sites decays rather slowly with distance .",
    "this procedure yields all magnetic coupling constants from the same order of perturbation theory , irrespective of the range of the coupling .",
    "as we deal with delocalized ligand states , instead of atomic ligand states , hopping processes are included up to infinite order , in principle . yet",
    ", this approach remains limited to the interaction of pairs of magnetic sites .",
    "it should finally be noted that each hopping path yields a certain amplitude , and a bilinear expression of such amplitudes leads to the value of the respective coupling constant .",
    "@xcite the hopping paths may be divided into two classes , one where the interacting spins meet at a magnetic site ( the conventional picture of superexchange ) , and the other where they meet in a cluster state .",
    "the latter processes dominate , because of the presence of the many cluster states .",
    "interference effects play a very important role , leading to some important consequences :    * they limit the range of coupling to essentially first and second nearest neighbors . * the @xmath30 destructive interference of the gka rule is removed ( actually shifted in angle ) .",
    "thereby the crystal fields at the ligand sites , produced by the neighbor atoms ( and modulated by their motion ) play an important role.@xcite * electron - electron interaction at the ligand sites will also modify the interference ; however , there does not appear a tractable way to include it into our perturbative approach .",
    "changes of atomic positions can be included easily in our calculations , this allows to determine the variations of the nearest and second nearest neighbor magnetic coupling constants ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) with atomic displacements .",
    "we have performed the calculations using cluster sizes of twelve and sixteen oxygen ions and have used three different sets of parameters ( a , b , c ) .",
    "the values of the parameters lie in the range of values discussed in the literature , e.g. , for the hopping integrals we used values similar to those given by mattheiss . @xcite",
    "as our main goal is to investigate the reasonable range of spin - phonon coupling constants , we have chosen the model parameters to yield the standard values of @xmath31 k and @xmath32 .",

    "sets b and c include the cu d level coupling to the apex oxygens . for set c",
    "smaller o - o hopping parameters than in a and b have been used . the slight difference between o(2)-o(2 )",
    "hoppings along @xmath33 and @xmath34 is incorporated by the @xmath35 parameters ; i.e.  by the distance dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we consider sets a and b as typical for cugeo@xmath0 , while set c with its much smaller @xmath36 value may indicate the range of variations possible with still physically rather meaningful hopping parameters .    the crystal field acting on the o(2 ) p levels has been calculated using a point charge model for a shell of seven neighbor ions .",
    "these are o , ge , cu ions , where we assumed nominal ionic charges of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , respectively and a dielectric constant @xmath41 . for the calculation of the crystal field integrals , hydrogen - like 2p wave functions of the o(2 )",
    "sites were used . at equilibrium separation , the monopole contribution ( l=0 ) to the crystal field matrix was removed ( as this term is incorporated in the value of the atomic energy @xmath42 ) .",
    "the resulting crystal field splitting of the o(2 ) p levels is given in tab .",

    "including the spin - phonon calculations , the cu @xmath43 ground state is predominantly of @xmath44 symmetry , with very little admixture of the other d orbitals .",
    "the @xmath45 orbital is always lowered considerably , caused by the strong @xmath28 hopping between the @xmath45 hole orbital and the oxygen - p cluster states .",
    "all other @xmath43 levels are much less affected . since for set",
    "c the p - p hopping is considerably smaller than for sets a and b , the band width of the oxygen - p cluster states is reduced and , as a consequence , also the d level splitting . experimental information on the positions of the excited cu @xmath43 levels in cugeo@xmath0 is not known to us , a range between 1.5 ev and 3 ev appears to be reasonable .",
    "our calculations of the magnetic coupling constants also include the spin hopping paths involving excited cu @xmath43 levels .",
    "however , these contributions turn out to be negligible , both for ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic exchange paths . as a consequence",
    ", the energy positions of the excited @xmath43 levels actually turn out to be irrelevant for the values of the magnetic coupling constants .",

    "our values given in tab .  [ coups ] include a factor @xmath57 , for comparison with wgb , who used a different normalization .",
    "a linear transformation leads to the angular coupling constants @xmath58 ( to the change of the cu - o(2)-cu angle @xmath5 ) and @xmath59 ( to the change of the o(2)-o(2)-ge angle @xmath2 ) and to the coupling to bond length variations @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see tab .",

    "@xcite wgb report a value of @xmath87 % /gpa , however they extrapolate all coupling constants to the homogeneous deformation of the lattice from the four @xmath1-mode spin - phonon coupling constants , neglecting the q - dependence of the coupling .    in summary ,",
    "our pressure results are based on an incomplete experimental data base .",
    "nevertheless , there are indications that there exists a considerable non - linearity in the pressure dependence , even at small pressures , probably due to the ` soft ' b - direction of the crystal .",

    "we have applied fourth order superexchange perturbation theory to a hubbard - type model with five d orbitals at the cu sites and three p orbitals at the o ligand sites . because of the significant direct p - p hopping , delocalized o(2 ) cluster states have been used . in this way , hopping processes up to infinite order have been included , equivalent , in principle , to the rkky treatment of the interaction of spin pairs in metals . in our treatment",
    "we also incorporate the effects of the ge sites , which mainly cause splittings of the o(2 ) p levels and modulate them with atomic displacements .      1 .",
    "the largest contributions to the spin - exchange coupling constants arises from those hopping paths , where doubly occupied cluster states are involved .",
    "doubly occupied cu states are less important .",
    "further , only processes involving the cu d ground - state level contribute significantly , all processes involving excited cu d levels can be ignored .",
    "the range of spin coupling constants is limited to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "any longer distance coupling can be ignored for the range of parameters we used for our calculations . increasing the oxygen band width ( by increasing the p - p hopping integrals ) leads to a longer range of the magnetic coupling .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling constants show considerable q - dependence .",
    "the results for the @xmath1-modes are in satisfactory agreement with the values presented by wgb .",
    "there are , however , also significant differences , in particular , concerning the magnitude of the coupling to the angle @xmath2 ( o(2)-o(2)-ge ) .",

    "the results using a non - linear interpolation agree much better with experimental data and other theoretical estimates of the pressure dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "although the crystallographic pressure data exhibit significant scattering , in particular for the internal lattice parameters , and further appear to be sample dependent to some extend , we think that the non - linear pressure dependence may , indeed , be a real effect .",
    "the cugeo@xmath0 lattice structure exhibits a ` soft ' direction along the @xmath55 axis with van - der - waals - type bonding between the sheets containing the cuo@xmath9 chains .",
    "crystals with similarly anisotropic bonding , such as the spiral structures of se or te also show significant non - linearity in the pressure data .",
    "@xcite it would be highly desirable to have available improved crystallographic pressure data .",
    "non - linear , i.e.  anharmonic behavior of certain phonon modes may also cause some of the discrepancies between our results on spin phonon coupling and those of wgb .",
    "a candidate for large anharmonicities is the lowest lying mode of the four phonon modes involved in the spin - peierls transition .",
    "this mode mainly consists of o(2 ) displacements , which modulate the o(2)-o(2)-ge angle @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we should remark that some of the assumptions underlying our studies may be questionable .",
    "this does not so much concern the values of the model parameters - we think , we have studied a physically meaningful range .",
    "it concerns more the assumption that on - site interactions at the ligand sites can be neglected , since we find that doubly occupied cluster states are very important in the spin exchange paths . but note that there is also a dilution effect , as the extended nature of the cluster states reduces the impact of the on - site interactions .",
    "unfortunately , this could not be quantified , since we do not see any simple way to include electronic interactions at ligand sites into our perturbative ( cluster ) treatment .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the interaction parameters are much less established than those for cu@xmath88 .",
    "exact diagonalization studies are limited to a few cu and o(2 ) atoms and also have to rely on estimates of the o(2 ) interaction parameters . density functional theory calculations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hampered by the problem that the anti - ferromagnetic state is not the dft ground state of the solid . in our view , the only way to improve the present level of quality in magnetic coupling calculations is to use ab initio quantum chemistry methods for small @xmath89_n$ ] clusters , properly embedded .    in view of the above discussion",
    "we think that our method is a reliable tool for the calculation of magnetic coupling constants and related quantities such as spin - phonon couplings in relatively complex materials like cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "the main advantage is that band - like properties of the system under consideration are taken into account . in addition",

    "<S> calculations for spin - phonon coupling constants in cugeo@xmath0 are presented , applying fourth order superexchange perturbation theory to an extended hubbard model . in our treatment , the intermediate oxygen ligand states are described by band - like cluster states , due to the presence of significant o(p)-o(p ) hopping . </S>",
    "<S> we also include the effect of the ge ions on the o ligand states .    </S>",
    "<S> we find a considerable q - dependence of the spin - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath1-modes involved in the spin - peierls transition , our results of the coupling constants are in fair agreement with the work of werner , gros , and braden . yet some discrepancies remain , especially concerning the coupling to the vibrations , which modulate the o(2)-o(2)-ge angle @xmath2 . our studies of the pressure dependence of the magnetic coupling constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 suggest , that relatively large non - linear effects are present , even at small pressure values , probably due to the existence of a ` soft ' , van - der - waals - type bond direction in cugeo@xmath0 .    2 </S>"
