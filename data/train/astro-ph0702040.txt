    "the most exciting cosmological discovery in recent years has been the observed late  time acceleration of the expansion of the universe ( riess et al .  1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) . when this observation is combined with other cosmological data from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and galaxy redshift surveys , the best fit model to all these data is a flat universe with @xmath2% of its energy density in the form of dark matter and @xmath3% in the form of `` dark energy '' ; a mysterious component of the universe with an effective negative pressure .",
    "the simplest explanation for dark energy is a `` cosmological constant '' ( @xmath0 ) as introduced by einstein in his general theory of relativity to create a static universe . in recent times , the cosmological constant has been interpreted as the `` vacuum energy '' , but the observed value of @xmath0 is a factor of @xmath4 smaller than its natural value from particle physics ( krauss & turner 1995 ; carroll 2001 ) .",
    "alternatives to the cosmological constant include time  evolving dark energy models , such as quintessence ( ratra & peebles 1988 ; wetterich 1988 ) , and modifications of gravity at large scales ( deffayet , dvali & gabadadze 2002 ; carloni et al . 2005 ;",
    "damour , kogan & papazoglou 2002 ) .",
    "the current cosmological data is only good enough to measure the local value of the dark energy density .",
    "therefore , the present data prefers a cosmological constant , mainly because it is the simplest model , whilst time  evolving models of dark energy ( which possess more free parameters ) remain relatively unconstrained by present datasets ( see corasaniti et al . 2004 ; bassett et al .",
    "2004 ; liddle et al .",
    "2006 ) .    over the next decade , numerous experiments are proposed , over a wide range of redshifts , to explore the time ",
    "evolution of dark energy and determine its density as a function of cosmic time .",
    "these experiments ( both ground  based and space  based ) represent an investment of billions of dollars and essentially use two general techniques to probe the dark energy : geometrical tests of the expansion history of the universe using `` standard tracers '' ( see below ) , and/or observations of the rate of growth of large  scale structures ( clusters & superclusters ) in the universe .",
    "the relative merits of these two techniques , and the proposed experiments , have been explored in detail by the u.s .",
    "dark energy task force ( detf ; albrecht et al .",
    "2006 ) and a similar endeavour in the u.k . in this paper",
    ", we focus on measurements of the time ",
    "evolution of dark energy using observations of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) from large galaxy surveys .",
    "the baos are generated by acoustic waves in the baryon ",
    "photon plasma in the early universe , which become frozen into the cmb radiation , and the distribution of matter , soon after the universe cools and re  combines at @xmath5 . over the last 5 years",
    ", the scale of these baos has been accurately measured in the cmb by a number of experiments ( wmap , archeops & boomerang ) , as well as discovered in the distribution of matter ( galaxies and clusters ) at low redshift ( see miller , nichol & batuski 2001 ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ; cole et al .",
    "2005 ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "for example , eisenstein et al . (",
    "2005 ) used these observations to constrain the flatness of the universe to 1% , under the assumption that dark energy is a cosmological constant .    as the scale of the baos can be predicted to sub  percent accuracy",
    "( see eisenstein , seo & white 2006 ; eisenstein & white 2004 ) , they provide an excellent `` standard ruler '' which can be used to map the geometry of the universe through the angular - diameter distance and the hubble parameter relation ( see blake & glazebrook 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ) .",
    "several spectroscopic experiments have been proposed to observe and measure this standard ruler at high redshift and thus constrain the time ",
    "evolution of dark energy , e.g. , wfmos ( bassett , nichol & eisenstein 2005 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2005a ) , baryon oscillation probe ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2005b ) , virus ( hill et al .",
    "2005 ) in the optical and nir , and the hubble sphere hydrogen survey ( peterson et al .",
    "2006 ) and square kilometre array ( blake et al . 2004 ) in the radio .",
    "these new experiments share the desire to measure millions of galaxy redshifts ( at high redshift ) over large volumes of the universe to control the errors from both cosmic variance and poisson noise ( blake & glazebrook 2003 ; glazebrook & blake 2005 ) .    given the large investment in time and money for these next generation bao experiments , we study here the optimal survey strategy for galaxy redshift surveys like those proposed for wfmos ( wide - field multi - object spectrograph ; see glazebrook et al .",
    "this work builds upon our previous development of the integrated parameter survey optimization ( ipso ) framework ( bassett 2005 ; bassett , parkinson & nichol 2005 ) and addresses key observational issues such as :    * what are the optimal redshifts for bao observations ? * what is the best combination of areal coverage and target density ? * what type of galaxies are the best targets ?",
    "although our answers for these questions are derived for wfmos  like galaxy surveys , we believe that our results are general to bao experiments in optical wavebands . the analysis presented in this paper",
    "optimises @xmath0cosmologies ( i.e. , a cosmological constant ) for the underlying cosmological model against which we are optimizing .",
    "ideally we would like to optimize the observations for a variety of dark energy models , and we will present such an analysis in a future paper . as a consequence therefore , our conclusions and results naturally favour lower - redshift bao observations where the effect of @xmath0 on the expansion history of the universe is greatest",
    ". we also neglect the improvements to the distance measurements that will arise by reconstructing the acoustic peak in the non - linear regime ( see eisenstein et al 2006b ) , assuming instead a non - linear cut - off for the power spectrum that evolves with redshift .    in section [ optimizingmethod ] , we outline our methodology and define the figure - of - merit ( fom ) used to judge the optimality of different survey designs . in section [ procedure ] , we lay out the procedures used to conducting the optimization , while in section [ lfs ] , we describe the model we used to determine the density of target galaxies .",
    "we present and discuss our results in sections [ results ] and [ discussion ] respectively .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we perform our optimization using the ipso framework ( bassett 2005 ) .",
    "consider a set of allowed survey geometries , indexed by @xmath6 .",
    "for each survey geometry , @xmath6 , we compute an appropriate figure - of - merit ( fom ) - also known as the utility in bayesian evidence design , risk or fitness - and optimization then simply proceeds by selecting the survey geometry which extremises ( minimising or maximising where appropriate ) the fom .",
    "performing such an optimization therefore requires three elements : a survey configuration parameter space @xmath7 to search through , a target parameter space @xmath8 of the parameters that we wish to optimally constrain ( labelled @xmath9 ) , and a numerical figure - of - merit ( fom ) .",
    "we consider each of these three elements in turn .",
    "the survey parameters are those parameters which completely describe the survey we wish to test .",
    "we start by splitting the survey into two redshift regimes , one at low redshift ( @xmath10 ) and one at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) , and considering these regimes completely separately .",
    "the properties of the survey in each regime are described by a set of parameters : @xmath12 ( survey time in that regime ) , @xmath13 ( survey area in that regime ) , @xmath14 ( number of contiguous redshift bins in that regime ) , @xmath15 ( median redshift of the @xmath16th redshift bin ) , and @xmath17 ( half - width of the @xmath16th redshift bin ) .",
    "there is also a further parameter , @xmath18 , which is the number of pointings performed per field  of  view , i.e. , the number of times the telescope observes the same patch of the sky .",
    "this parameter is derived from the other parameters , using a model of the galaxy number density as a function of exposure time , in conjunction with the assumed number of fibres .",
    "all of these parameters are listed in table [ surveyparameters ] .",
    ".survey parameters in each redshift regime [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ instrumentfom ]    we find that line - emitting galaxies are strongly preferred as targets for wfmos ( regardless of field - of - view ) , whereas red galaxies are marginally preferred for sdss and aaomega , which only have a few hundred fibres .",
    "this is consistent with the result for wfmos for a small number of fibres ( see fig .",
    "[ fibres ] ) , where red galaxies are preferred .",
    "we find that the sdss and aat are almost equivalent in terms of figure - of - merit , as the smaller aperture of the sdss system ( and so longer exposure times ) is balanced by the larger field - of - view and number of fibres .",
    "considering the de - scope option of reducing the wfmos field - of - view to 1 degree diameter , this reduces the survey area by a factor of 2 , and thus the fom drops by almost the same factor ( in detail , since the number of fibres is held constant , the fibre density increases , which offsets the loss of area to some extent ) . in other words ,",
    "equivalent results will be obtained by a 3-year survey with a 1.5-deg - diameter system and a 4.5-year survey with a 1-deg - diameter system .      during the construction period of a wfmos - like instrument , a number of other dark energy surveys will be performed .",
    "these measurements of the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter in the case of bao surveys , or luminosity distance in the case of type ia supernovae ( sn - ia ) surveys , will have already constrained some of the dark energy parameter space . by including the predictions for these surveys in our analysis , we can determine whether our optimal survey design changes .",
    "we consider two surveys that are currently underway : ( 1 ) wigglez , a baryon acoustic oscillation survey being carried out with the aaomega spectrograph ; and ( 2 ) the full five - year supernovae legacy survey and the sloan digitized sky survey ii supernova survey ( snls - sdss ) .",
    "the wigglez survey has the following parameters : area = 1000 sq deg , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , number density @xmath21 @xmath22 mpc@xmath23 , observing line - emission galaxies ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2007 ) . using our fitting formula code ( blake et al . 2006 ) we find that this corresponds to measurement accuracies of 3.1% in @xmath24 and 5.2% in @xmath25 .",
    "this is easy to include in our optimization , as it counts as an extra measurement at a redshift of 0.75 , without any time cost .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the wigglez measurement has no effect on any of the survey parameters , as shown in figure [ wfmos - wigglez ] , as the curves with and without the wigglez survey are virtually identical .",
    "this is because the wfmos measurement would produce a much more accurate measurement of dark energy properties .",
    "the snls - sdss sn - ia survey will find around 1000 supernovae distributed approximately evenly in the range @xmath26 ( d. andrew howell and the snls collaboration 2004 ; sdss - ii supernovae survey fall 2005 ) .",
    "the measurement is the apparent magnitude ( @xmath27 ) of the supernovae , defined as m(z ) = 5_10d_l(z)+[m + 25 ] .",
    "the luminosity distance will give us information about the expansion , but we have the added complication of marginalizing over the absolute magnitude @xmath28 .",
    "the supernova surveys therefore do not constrain the hubble parameter @xmath29 . the fisher matrix for supernova surveys",
    "is ( tegmark et al , 1998 ; kim et al , 2004 ) f_ij = dz n(z ) ,    where @xmath30 is the error in the magnitude and @xmath31 is the number of sn - ia in a redshift bin around @xmath32 .",
    "we assume 100 sn - ia in each of ten equally - spaced redshift bins from 0.1 to 1 , setting @xmath33 .",
    "appendix a details the evaluation of the fisher matrix elements .",
    "the sn - ia surveys and the wfmos bao survey are approximately equivalent in their effectiveness at investigating the dark energy , with the sn - ia fom being 158 , compared to the wfmos fom of 207 .",
    "when the two surveys are combined , we find once again that the inclusion of the sn - ia measurement has no effect on the distribution of survey parameters with figure - of - merit , as show in figure [ wfmos - snia ] .",
    "however , the increase in the figure - of - merit is marked , improving from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , equivalent to a shrinkage of error ellipse area of about @xmath36 times .",
    "this is due to the complimentary nature of the two types of measurement .",
    "in this paper we have conducted an optimization of the survey parameters of a wfmos - like survey of the baryon acoustic oscillations in order to best constrain the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we use the determinant of the @xmath37 fisher matrix of the predicted errors on the dark energy as our figure - of - merit to choose between different surveys .",
    "we find that when optimizing for a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) model of the dark energy ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , a line - emission galaxy selection strategy is preferred over continuum emission .",
    "the optimal survey spends all the available survey time ( 1500 hours in this analysis ) observing at low redshift , surveying an area of around 6000 sq .",
    "the medium redshift of the bin is about 1.1 and it will stretch from @xmath40 .",
    "the optimal solutions are not highly peaked , and the flexibility bars are often considerable . reducing the area by several hundred sq .  degs and increasing the target density ( for a fixed observing time ) does not change the dark energy measurements by a significant amount .",
    "we find that the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillations in a high redshift ( @xmath41 ) bin is not optimal for testing a @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is due to the long exposure times for obtaining redshifts of lbgs compared to @xmath42 galaxies .",
    "in addition , the effect of the dark energy on the expansion of the universe is negligible at high redshift ( assuming a cosmological constant ) and so measuring the baos at this redshift ( in addition to low redshift ) makes only ( at best ) a small extra contribution to the figure - of - merit .",
    "if we consider other more exotic dark energy models with non - negligible energy density at high redshift , it may become more important and favoured by the ipso method .",
    "alternatively , the high - redshift baos could be measured with a lyman-@xmath43 survey `` piggy - backed '' on the low - redshift galaxy survey ( mcdonald & eisenstein , 2006 ) .",
    "however the high redshift part of the survey only serves to cross - check the paradigm and will not improve statistical error bars on the cosmological parameters .",
    "even so , the high redshift bin should nt be ruled out purely on this basis , as it may be responsible for completely new discoveries .",
    "we also examine the optimal instrument design , analyzing the scientific benefit / penalties of different choices . in particular , increasing the number of fibres has a positive effect on the fom , as more objects can be observed simultaneously , and a higher number density can be achieved for a given exposure time .",
    "this fom increase continues until the number of fibres reaches some optimal value , at which point enough galaxies have been observed to easily beat shot noise effects , and the fom stops increasing .",
    "this optimal value is around 10,000 fibres for line - emission strategies , and 750 for continuum emission .",
    "the large difference between the two strategies is due to the ability of the line - emission surveys to reach higher redshifts .",
    "we note that since 10,000 fibres only obtains successful redshifts for about 6000 galaxies , compared to most efficient number of fibres by this criterion is 2000 .",
    "this survey configuration has a significantly lower fom compared to the optimal survey ( 151 , compared to 328 for 10,000 fibres ) , and so the optimum would be a value around 3000 - 4000 fibres .",
    "note that if we were to include the effect of reconstructing the power spectra on small scales ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006b ) , this may increase the required number of fibres .",
    "reconstruction increases the performance in measuring the baos for any number density , but works especially well at high number densities , and may therefore increase the optimal number density .",
    "we find that including measurements made by other baryon oscillation and supernovae surveys in the total error analysis does not change the optimal survey , indicating that the analysis we do now should remain valid into the medium future .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated how the ipso technique can be applied to `` realistic '' simulations of redshift surveys , including instrumental limitations such as fibre number , repositioning overheads and galaxy number counts models . since the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations is one method to measure the dark energy , ipso could also be applied to the survey & instrumental design that use other methods such as weak lensing , integrated sachs - wolfe or cluster number counts , or even those with other science goals .",
