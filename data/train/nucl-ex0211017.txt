    "strangeness production / enhancement has been long suggested as a possible signature able to discriminate between the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and hadron gas ( hg ) scenario in heavy ions collisions .",
    "due to high gluon density expected in high energy nuclear collisions , the production of multi - strange baryons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) may be enhanced over other particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , any enhancement is expected to increase with the strangeness content of the particle , making the @xmath4 the most sensitive strangeness probe .",
    "its production relative to other hadrons gives a severe constraint to statistical models .",
    "in addition , early kinetic freeze - out of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 has been suggested at sps , which would result in these particles carrying information on the flow velocity of strongly interacting matter ( hg or qgp at hadronisation ) @xcite .",
    "thus , measuring the transverse velocity of @xmath4 may be helpful in understanding the system evolution of collective expansion  @xcite .",
    "the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector system @xcite , in the configuration used to collect data presented here , consists principally of a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) used for charged particle tracking . a magnet surrounding the tpc",
    "was operated at 0.25 ( 0.5 ) t for the data taken at @xmath7  gev .",
    "triggering was achieved using two hadronic calorimeters ( zdc ) in the very forward region and an array of scintillator slats arranged in a barrel ( ctb ) around the tpc .",
    "the centrality cuts used correspond to the top 11% ( 130 gev ) and 10% ( 200 gev ) of the total hadronic cross section .",
    "in addition , the reconstructed @xmath4 were selected in the kinematical region @xmath8 gev / c and @xmath9 . the total number of events analysed is @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the 130 and 200 gev runs respectively .",
    "the current analysis proceeds as follows in order to reconstruct the omega baryon . as a first step ,",
    "@xmath12 were reconstructed topologically through the sequential weak decay @xmath13 ( br=67.8% ) and @xmath14(br=63.9% ) . within an event ,",
    "all tracks reconstructed in the tpc were extrapolated backward to the primary vertex of the collision .",
    "candidate tracks were paired to form neutral decay vertices ( @xmath15 ) , which were associated afterward with a bachelor track to form @xmath4 vertices .",
    "selections are mainly based on geometrical cuts , i.e. distance of closest approach between candidate tracks and to the primary vertex . then , to reduce further the combinatorial background resulting from close but uncorrelated tracks , an identification of daughter tracks based on mean specific energy loss in the tpc was used .",

    "the raw signals were corrected for acceptance and efficiency using monte carlo @xmath4 s embedded into real events .",
    "figure [ fig : ratioomhminus ] shows the corrected transverse mass spectra at @xmath19 gev .",
    "the yields ( dn / dy ) and the inverse slopes ( t ) are extracted from exponential fits ( specified by eq.[eq : fitfunction ] ) to the data . @xmath20",
    "the results are quoted in table  [ table : yieldsslopes ] along with those at @xmath21 = 130 gev @xcite .",
    "statistical models have produced values of dn / dy that are in good agreement with preliminary results at @xmath22 gev @xcite , assuming chemical equilibrium with t @xmath23 175 mev and @xmath24 @xmath23 47 mev .",
    ".yields and inverse slopes parameters ( extrapolations at low m@xmath25 correspond to 34% and 18% of the total yields ) .",

    "[ fig : ratioomhminus ] for sps and rhic energies . unlike at the sps , the @xmath27 ratio approaches the @xmath26 ratio at rhic ;",
    "this can be explained by the lower net baryon density in the system .",
    "the @xmath26 ratio is found to be consistent with the values obtained at sps ; its value might indicate that strangeness saturation was already reached at sps and we are still in that regime at rhic .",
    "this trend has also been observed for the @xmath3 particles and is detailed in  @xcite .",

    "thus , we obtain @xmath35 equal to 0.45 @xmath36 0.17 ( syst . ) .",
    "this compares to @xmath37 @xmath23 0.2 for @xmath38 @xcite and may be interpreted as a higher transverse flow component at rhic .",
    "the parameters extracted from similar fits for pions , kaons and protons are t@xmath32 = 100 mev and @xmath35 = 0.6 ( for au+au at 200 gev ) @xcite , and are not compatible with the ones we obtained for @xmath4 ( using a different approach , the latest na49 results @xcite have shown that a global fit of particles spectra with a single set of parameters ( t@xmath32,@xmath35 ) , including @xmath4 , was possible at @xmath21 = 17.3 gev ) .",

    "kinetic freeze - out temperature is not a free parameter ( t@xmath32 = 170 mev or 130 mev ) .",
    "the two other lines are a representation of the fit function for two extreme cases : ( t@xmath32 = 100 mev , @xmath35 = 0.6 ) and ( t@xmath32 = 170 mev , @xmath35 = 0 . ) ]    [ fig : omegabwfit ]",
    "we have presented preliminary results on @xmath4 and @xmath39 production at rhic .",
    "we found similar @xmath40 and inverse slope values at @xmath21 = 130 gev and 200 gev .",
    "multi - strange particles ratios give some indication that the fireball is chemically equilibrated and the @xmath4 production scale with h@xmath2 from sps to rhic .",
    "the mean transverse velocity of the @xmath4 , assuming an early thermal freeze - out , is found to be @xmath35 = 0.45 @xmath36 0.17 ( syst . ) .",
    "it would be premature to draw conclusions about @xmath4 flow ( since , among other details , its @xmath41 is unknown ) but the increase in @xmath35 from sps to rhic energy raises the question of which mechanism might produce it @xcite . in the near future , with larger statistics , improvements in the determination of transverse flow ( blast - wave fits ) as well as anisotropic flow ( v@xmath42 ) measurement of @xmath4 might be possible and give us a clearer picture of the @xmath4 dynamics .",
