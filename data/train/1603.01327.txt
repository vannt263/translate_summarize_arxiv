    "geometric langlands duality predicts existence of an automorphic @xmath1-module @xmath2 on @xmath3 attached to a ( de  rham ) @xmath4-local system @xmath5 .",
    "here @xmath6 , @xmath4 are reductive groups dual in the sense of langlands , @xmath3 is the moduli stack of @xmath6-bundles on a complete smooth irreducible curve @xmath7 and the local system @xmath5 on @xmath7 with structure group @xmath4 is assumed to be irreducible ( i.e. , it does not admit a reduction to a proper parabolic subgroup ) .    in their celebrated unpublished work",
    "@xcite beilinson and drinfeld explain that geometric langlands duality can be thought of as a quantization of a natural duality for the hitchin integrable systems associated to two langlands dual groups @xmath6 , @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , they present a construction of @xmath2 for a local system @xmath5 which carries an additional structure of an _ oper _ , see @xcite for an introduction to this notion .",
    "their construction uses local to global arguments , it relies heavily on representation theory of affine lie algebras at the critical level .    in this note",
    "we describe ( for @xmath8 ) a much shorter construction bypassing affine lie algebra representations , relying on reduction to positive characteristic .",
    "more precisely , we use the ( easy ) construction of automorphic @xmath1-modules @xmath2 for a generic local system @xmath5 on a curve over a field of positive characteristic @xcite .",
    "we verify that under the generic geometric langlands equivalence in positive characteristic of @xcite the free critically twisted @xmath1-module corresponds to ( the pushforward of ) the structure sheaf of opers , this is deduced from a general observation relating the image of the free @xmath1-module under the hecke functor to opers presented in section [ secfil ] ( this part of the argument is closely related to ideas of @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to show that global sections of the sheaf of critically twisted @xmath1-modules on @xmath9 is a flat deformation of the ring of functions on the hitchin base , by first doing it in positive characteristic and then deducing the general case by a standard argument .",
    "the construction of automorphic @xmath1-modules corresponding to opers follows from this in view of the observation from section [ secfil ] .",
    "let us mention that the theme started in @xcite , where geometric langlands duality was established for @xmath10 local systems with a smooth spectral curve has been developed in @xcite , where the case of not necessarily smooth spectral curves has been treated and @xcite , @xcite dealing with @xmath6 local systems for @xmath11 .",
