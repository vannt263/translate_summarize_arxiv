    "bulk viscosity can damp the density oscillations in compact stars , which could be excited at the time of their formation from supernovae explosions , or during the phase transitions @xcite , or due to instabilities result from the emission of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "as one of the most important transport coefficients , bulk viscosities of simple @xmath0 matter , of hyperon matter and even of quark matter , both in normal and superfuild states , have been extensively studied @xcite , for more references see @xcite . however , until recently , sad et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there exists a new mechanism for dissipating the energy of stellar oscillations .",
    "they indicated that the mechanical energy of density perturbations is not only disspiated to heat via bulk viscosity , but also is radiated away via neutrinos .",
    "they named this new mechanism the radiative viscosity , and found it is 1.5 times larger than the bulk viscosity to all urca processes , both in nuclear matter and quark matter .",
    "the newly realized radiative viscosity was calculated only in the lowest order of @xmath2 @xcite , which corresponds to the linear approximation .",
    "however , the density oscillations during the stellar evolution may arise to sufficiently large amplitude so that no - linear effects can no longer be neglected .",
    "we aim to study the non - linear effects of radiative viscosity in this paper .",
    "we will study non - linear effects of radiative viscosity of simple @xmath0 matter , both for direct urca process ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and for modified urca process ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) . as indicated by lattimer et al .",
    "@xcite , if the proton and electron fermi momenta are too small compared with neutron fermi momenta , the nucleon direct urca process is forbidden because it is impossible to satisfy conservation of momentum . under typical conditions",
    ", one finds that the ratio of the number density of protons to that of nucleons must exceed 1/9 for the process to be allowed .",
    "we not only make a numerical solution of radiative viscosity bue also study the ratio of the viscosity coefficient to the bulk one . by doing so",
    ", we hope to know which mechanism is more important under special condition .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we derive the formulae of radiative viscosity including non - linear effects . and radiative viscosity for a specific model of neutron star ( ns ) matter is calculated in sect.3 .",
    "finally , sect.4 presents the conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section we derive the expression for radiative viscosity of neutron stars whose cores consist of simple @xmath0 matter using an approach similar to that of bulk viscosity calculations has been done by wang and lu @xcite , sawyer @xcite , madsen @xcite and gupta et al . @xcite .",
    "we first recall how to solve chemical potential perturbations with stellar oscillations .",
    "assume that the volume per unit mass , @xmath7 , changes periodically in time according to the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the equilibrium volume , @xmath10 is the perturbation amplitude , and @xmath11 is the period .",
    "taking the chemical potential difference as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the chemical potentials of the neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "@xmath16 can be expanded near the equilibrium according to @xmath17 ( note that @xmath18 in equilibrium ) @xmath19 are particle numbers per unit mass and @xmath20 using the thermodynamical relations @xmath21 and considering @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the particle numbers per unit volume ) , one gets @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the pressure , and the net reaction rate is @xmath27 according to @xcite and introducing @xmath28 , for direct urca process @xmath29 @xmath30 and for modified urca process @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    where @xmath33 is the ratio of the number density of protons to that of nucleons , and @xmath34 .    given a specific equation of state ( eos ) of @xmath0 matter , @xmath35 can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( @xmath36 ) , ( @xmath37 ) , ( @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath39 ) numerically , which will be done in section 3 .",
    "once the time dependence of chemical potential difference is known , one can easily calculate the bulk and radiative viscous coefficient .    for a periodic process , the",
    "expansion and contraction of the system will induce not only the dissipation of oscillation energy to heat , but also the loss of oscillation energy through an increasing of the neutrino emissivity .",
    "bulk viscous coefficient @xmath40 and radiative viscous coefficient @xmath41 can be defined for the description of these dissipation mechanisms , respectively @xcite @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the hydrodynamic velocity associated with the density oscillations .    using the continuity equation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath45 @xmath46 where the energy dissipation is @xmath47 and the neutrino emissivity caused by the oscillation of @xmath48 is @xmath49 dt,\\ ] ] for direct urca process @xcite @xmath50 and for modified urca process @xmath51",
    "for illustration , we use a phenomenological eos proposed by prakash et al .",
    "@xcite . according to these authors , the nuclear energy is presented in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the energy of symmetric nuclear matter and @xmath54 is the symmetry energy . supposing the electron energy is @xmath55 , one has @xmath56/\\partial x_{p}=0 $ ] in @xmath57 equilibrium .    at the saturation density @xmath34",
    "the symmetry energy is measured in laboratory , @xmath58 ; while at higher @xmath59 it is still unknown .",
    "prakash et al .",
    "@xcite displayed @xmath54 in the following form @xmath60+s(\\rho_{0})f(u),\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 satifies the condition @xmath63 .",
    "we employ their model i ( @xmath64 ) with the compression modulus of saturated nuclear matter @xmath65mev .",
    "this is a moderately stiff eos , the maximum stellar mass for it is @xmath66 .",
    "the direct urca process is allowed only if @xmath67 ; in our eos model it demands @xmath68 , which means the direct urca process is completely forbidden in ns when its mass is smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "considering @xmath70 and @xmath71 , one has @xmath72 thus , @xmath35 can be solved numerically , and the bulk and radiative viscosity can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( @xmath73 ) and ( @xmath74 ) , respectively .",
    "the solid line in fig.1 and fig.2 shows radiative viscosity as function of relative volume perturbation amplitude for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , note that the onset of the direct urca process is @xmath77 . as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the flat branches in fig.1 for the direct urca process follows the @xmath78 law : when @xmath79 increases by four orders ( form @xmath80mev to @xmath81mev ) , viscosity increases by about 16 orders .",
    "in contrast , the flat branches in fig.2 for the modified urca process follows the @xmath82 law , and the radiative viscosity of modified urca process is much lower than direct urca process .",
    "however , the behavior of the onset of non - linear effect is similar for the two different processes : the lower the temperature , the smaller the relative volume perturbation amplitude is for non - linear effects to dominate . in the other words , as @xmath79 decreases ,",
    "non - linear effect becomes more and more important .",
    "further more , we also present the results up to @xmath83 .",
    "as we all know , when calculated up to @xmath84 , one can only get the linear results ; and non - linear effects are usually introduced by calculating up to @xmath83 . but by comparing solid and dash curves in fig.1 and fig.2 , we can see that it s not enough just including the lowest order of non - linear effects .",
    "fig.3 presents the ratio of radiative viscosity to bulk viscosity as function of relative volume perturbation amplitude . for both direct urca and modified urca , @xmath85 when @xmath86 is sufficiently small , which is in agreement with the results given by sad and schaffner - bielich @xcite . and",
    "for both processes , non - linear effects lead to the decreasing of @xmath87 , and the lower the temperature , the more remarkable the non - linear effect is .",
    "nevertheless , for direct urca process , @xmath87 can reach 0.5 when @xmath86 is large enough ; but @xmath87 can be equivalent to 0.375 for modified urca process . comparing the formulae ( @xmath88 ) with ( @xmath89 ) , and ( @xmath90 ) with ( @xmath91 ) , one",
    "immediately know that the ratios only depend on the average value of the net reaction rate and the increments of neutrino emissivity due to off - equilibrium , and eos ca nt effect the results at all .",
    "it is also interesting to plot @xmath87 as function of @xmath92 ( fig.4 ) , where @xmath93 is the perturbation amplitude of chemical potential difference @xmath35 .",
    "it s undoubtable that the curves are overlapped for different values of temperature in fig.4 .",
    "we have studied the non - linear effects of radiative viscosity of simple @xmath0 matter , both for direct urca process and for modified urca process , and found that non - linear effects decrease @xmath87 from 1.5 ( the linear scenario ) to 0.5 ( for direct urca process ) and 0.375 ( for modified urca process ) . which means that in the linear scenario , only @xmath94 times of the total oscillation energy is converted to heat and the large faction of the energy",
    "is emitted as neutrinos ; in contrast , if the amplitude of the oscillation is large enough and the non - linear effects can not be ignored , the main part of the total oscillation energy is converted to heat ( @xmath95 for direct urca process and @xmath96 for modified process ) .",
    "although the numerical results of the coefficients are calculated for a specific eos , the ratio of the two types of viscosity coefficient is eos - independent .    in the case of superfluid",
    "@xmath0 matter , since superfluidity causes different effects to the net reaction rate and the increments of neutrino emissivity due to off - equilibrium , we expect that both in linear regime and in non - linear regime , the value of @xmath87 will have great differences comparing with the normal eos .",
