    "our work on young southern binary systems has been presented in several earlier papers concentrating on individual well - documented examples . in the present paper",
    "we consider two close binaries ",
    "gg lup and @xmath1 sco  that allow more compact summaries .",
    "further background was given by budding , ( 2008  hereafter ` paper i ' ) .",
    "a recent general review was given by idaczyk et al .",
    "andersen s ( 1991 ) review gave an interesting rationale for this kind of work .",
    "we give more particulars on gg lup next .",
    "photometric data ( section 2.1 ) are later combined with new spectroscopic material ( sections 2.2 - 5 ) to refine knowledge of the absolute parameters of the components ( section 2.6 ) .",
    "a similar treatment then follows for @xmath1 sco in section 3 .",
    "section 4 summarizes the derived information on both binaries within the context of their galactic environment .",
    "this arrangement follows similar lines to that of previous papers of this programme .    although these two young , short - period , early type systems are both likely members of the sco - cen ob2 association and of comparable age , their physical characteristics are quite different in some respects .",
    "they do , however , both show indications of additional variability , beyond that associated with close binarity .",
    "such effects compromise their precise parametrization .",
    "we aim to clarify the background on their observed properties . at the same time , we challenge some of the claims of previous authors on modelling details .",
    "gg lup (= hd 135876 , hip 74950 , hr 5687 ) is a relatively bright ( @xmath13 @xmath9 5.5 - 6.1 , @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath15 @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath15 @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; cutri et al . , 2003 ) , young b7v + b9v type close binary system with period @xmath24 d , having a known appreciable eccentricity @xmath25 .",
    "neubauer ( 1930 ) discovered it as a close spectroscopic pair .",
    "photometry showing eclipses later appeared from smith ( 1966 ) and strohmeier ( 1967 ) .",
    "a thorough study was given by andersen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who , noting the youth of the stars ( age estimated at @xmath920 my ) , found a relatively short period of just over 100 y for its apsidal advance .",
    "this was confirmed by wolf and zejda ( 2005 ) , although the coverage of the o  c curve is still not great .",
    "the sky location ra(2000 ) = 15h 18 m 56s ; dec(2000 ) = 404718 , hipparcos distance 162 @xmath3 17 pc and proper motions ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 mas y@xmath28 ) make the system a likely member of the upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ) concentration ( blaauw , 1964 ) of the sco - cen ob2 association , within the gould s belt giant star formation region ( nitschelm , 2004 ) .",
    "the system lies towards that part of the belt that is more separated from the disk ( @xmath29 = 330.9 ; @xmath30 = 14.0 deg ) . the relatively scant attention given previously to this interesting object",
    "may be due to its southerly declination ( @xmath31 deg ) .",
    "wolf and kern ( 1983 ) obtained _ uvby_@xmath32 measures for gg lup , noting a need for a revised ephemeris , while levato and malaroda ( 1970 ) , at la plata observatory , published a fairly high projected rotational velocity of 155 km s@xmath28 , presumably of the primary component .",
    "andersen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) emphasized the implications of their parameters for the system on the relationship of stellar properties to galactic environment : an issue that has significance to problems of stellar formation in general and gould s belt in particular .",
    "we start with an examination of the hipparcos light curve ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "the hipparcos data source gives the ephemeris min i = 2448500.55 + 1.84962e , which can be compared with that of andersen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) min i = 2446136.7398 + 1.84960e .",
    "kreiner et al ( 2001 ) refine the ephemeris to min i = 2446136.7477 + 1.8495927e .",
    "we show the hipparcos light curve in fig  1 together with our best - fitting model , whose main parameters are listed in table  1 .",
    "this modelling was done using the program fitter , whose theoretical basis was discussed by budding & demircan ( 2007 ; ch .",
    "the program s operation ( recently upgraded to winfitter ) has been detailed by rhodes ( 2014 ) , * while rhodes & budding ( 2014 ) presented a detailed discussion of the modelling and fitting procedure .",
    "* the approach uses a standard marquardt - levenberg type optimization technique with a fitting function that derives from kopal s ( 1959 ) linearization of close binary proximity effects in terms of spherical harmonics .",
    "the tidal and rotational distortions thus include the effects of finite mass of the envelopes .",
    "the reflection terms provide an ` albedo ' factor ( usually unity for radiative envelopes ) , for possible empirical modification of the luminous efficiency coefficients of hosokawa ( 1958 ) .",
    "the mean epoch of the hipparcos observations is given as hjd 2448349.0625 , almost six months before the time of minimum given above , and the data was collected over an approximately 3 year interval , so some uncertainty in the timing of the relevant periastron longitude arises .",
    "a more representative average epoch for the hipparcos data would be hjd 2448348.881 ; some 82 periods before the cited one .",

    "the photometric estimate has neglected interstellar reddening , however , and , although small at this distance , @xmath51 can be taken to be @xmath90.07 mag ( vam ) , which would allow the two distance estimates to agree within the errors of the determination . either distance would be consistent with the range given for the scorpius region of the sco - cen ob2 association ( de zeeuw et al . , 1999 ; preibisch & mamajek , 2008 ) .",
    "the absolute parameters given in table 12 are generally within their error estimates of those of vam , although outside the errors given by vam .",
    "it can be seen from figs 12 - 14 that the scatter in the photometric and spectroscopic sets , both vam s and ours , is @xmath910%   that of their amplitudes .",
    "the precision of parameters given by vam therefore seem to be over - optimistic , as our closer checks confirm  particularly for the masses .",
    "the parameters for the stars of gg lup given in table  7 suggest a relatively young pair , and this is supported by the physical characteristics of the system in which a high rotational velocity of the primary has still not been eroded by its frequent close encounters with its companion in the unusually eccentric orbit . in figure  16",
    "we plot stellar radii versus time using the data of the padova group ( bressan et al , 2012 ) with a solar composition .",
    "the derived radii and masses of the components turn out to be consistent with each other and with an age of approximately 33 my .",
    "this is not so young as the age estimated by andersen et al ( 1993 ) , and indeed significantly greater than representative values for the ucl region ( @xmath915 my , preibisch & mamajek , 2008 ) .",
    "andersen et al .  (",
    "1993 ) argued for a metal - composition for the stars of gg lup significantly below solar , putting particular weight on their derived relatively high gravity for the secondary star .",
    "our findings do not give unequivocal support to that argument , even though we have re - analysed the photometric and spectroscopic data used by andersen et al .  as well as our own data and find a good measure of agreement in the basic parameters of the fitting functions used to match all the data - sets , together with comparable levels of scatter in the residuals .",
    "whilst the arguments of andersen et al .",
    "are of interest , particularly in relation to the problem of the origin of gould s belt ( cf .",
    "e.g.  grenier , 2004 ) , we believe that a more realistic assessment of the parameter errors , especially of the masses , do not allow gg lup , at least not in isolation , to be used as a reliable discriminant between alternative composition possibilities . solar composition models can provide a self - consistent picture for the observed properties .",
    "in fact , if we were to apply the lower metal abundance value considered by andersen et al .",
    "( @xmath52 ) the starting radii in fig 16 are lowered and the time taken to achieve the presently observed values is increased by about 3 my , increasing the disparity with the average age of the ucl region stars .",
    "but the indications of pulsational instability or anomalously high rotation in the envelope of at least the primary component , given the unexpectedly persisting orbital eccentricity , may render comparisons with normal single stars inappropriate .",
    "[ fig-16 ] +    [ fig-17 ] +    on the other hand , for the sco ob2 association member @xmath1 sco , the radius of a star of the same mass as that found for the primary ( 8.3 m@xmath12 ) agrees closely with that measured for the star ( fig  17 ) .",
    "this agreement suggests that the primary has been relatively little affected by the case a type evolution of the secondary . the case a scenario , considered by giannuzzi ( 1983 ) , stickland et al ( 1996 ) and others , involving appreciable mass loss from the system in the relatively recent past , arises because of the anomalous mass , near roche - lobe - filling , and high - luminosity secondary star and therefore generally algol - like condition of the system , yet with the absence of significant period variation .    in that scenario ,",
    "the secondary must have lost at least @xmath94 m@xmath12 of its original mass .",
    "the primary s condition , meanwhile , remains measurably close to what it would have been as a single star at its present mass .",
    "if all the lost matter had been transferred , the primary would have started by following the lower track in figure  17 .",
    "but it is difficult to see how it could have then reached its present radius of about 4 r@xmath12 whilst maintaining stability on a kelvin timescale in accordance with the insignificant period variation .",
    "a plausible implication is that the very high surface temperature of the primary causes sufficient ionizing absorption in matter shed from the secondary that radiation pressure expels such plasma from the system via the external kepler ring ( de loore and van rensbergen , 2005 ) .",
