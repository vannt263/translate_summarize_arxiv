    "self - assembled inas quantum dots are ideal model systems to study the energetic structure and dynamics of fully quantized few carrier systems @xcite .",

    "it also makes it possible to study the quantum mechanical properties in great detail .    when investigating the non - equilibrium transport between a reservoir and the dot system , the charging and discharging dynamics are given by the tunneling matrix element , which gives access to , e.g. , wave function mapping @xcite and manipulation @xcite .    as we will show in the following ,",
    "also the multiplicity / degeneracy of the quantum dot states has a profound influence on the tunneling dynamics between the reservoir and the dots @xcite .",
    "starting from the observation that _ charging and discharging of the dots are governed by different relaxation times _ , we develop a non - equilibrium transport model based on a master equation .",
    "the comparison between the model and the experimental data allows us to determine the details of the degeneracy of the electronic @xmath0-shell .",
    "these details are usually hidden by the unavoidable inhomogeneous ensemble broadening of the energy structure , but can be resolved by studying the charging and discharging dynamics .",
    "the measurements are performed on an inverted algaas / gaas high electron mobility transistor structure as sketched in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) with an embedded layer of inas quantum dots . the layer sequence , grown by molecular beam epitaxy , is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the active part of the structure starts with a 300 nm thick al@xmath1ga@xmath2as layer , a silicon @xmath3-doping sheet ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) and an algaas spacer layer of 16 nm thickness .",
    "subsequently , a 15 nm thick gaas layer , which contains a two - dimensional electron gas , a 10 nm thick algaas tunneling layer , a 5 nm thick gaas spacer layer and the inas quantum dots are deposited .",
    "the dot formation takes place after evaporating the equivalent of 1.9 monolayers of inas at 525@xmath6c .",
    "this results in a dot density of @xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "the dots are covered by 150 nm of gaas and a 116 nm thick blocking layer of alternating alas / gaas layers ( 3 nm and 1 nm , respectively ) .",
    "the structure is capped by a protective , 5 nm thick gaas film .",
    "using standard lithographic techniques , the samples are patterned into a 60@xmath8 m long and 50@xmath8 m wide strip with source / drain contacts on either side .",
    "the central region is covered by a 50 nm thick gold layer , which serves as a gate electrode .",
    "the application of a gate voltage @xmath9 will shift the energetic position of the states in the quantum dots , which are embedded in the dielectric between the gate electrode and the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) @xcite .",
    "this way , the number of electrons per quantum dot can be adjusted between 0 and 6 @xcite . more specifically , each time the energy difference @xmath10 of the @xmath11-electron ground - state energies @xmath12 of the quantum dot is in resonance with the electro - chemical potential @xmath13 of the two - dimensional reservoir , electrons can tunnel between 2deg and quantum dots .    to monitor the tunneling dynamics between the dot ensemble and the 2deg",
    ", we use a recently developed transconductance spectroscopy technique @xcite . at a time @xmath14 ,",
    "a voltage pulse is applied to the gate , and the time - resolved response of the 2deg conductivity @xmath15 is recorded . for a positive pulse ( upward step in @xmath9 ) the energy of the quantum dot states",
    "are shifted downward , so that electrons can tunnel from the 2deg into unoccupied states in the dot layer .",
    "therefore , an exponential decrease of @xmath16 is observed , because mobile charges from the 2deg will become localized when they are transferred into the dots . for the reverse process ( when switching back to the original voltage ) , charges are transferred back out of the dots into the 2deg , so that its conductance will increase again @xcite . in this way , the conductivity of the 2deg is a direct measure of quantum - dot charge and the conductance traces as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] allow us to directly compare the charging with the discharging process .",
    "taking the geometric distance between the 2deg and the dot layer , @xmath17 , as well as the distance between the 2deg and the gate , @xmath18 , the energy shift @xmath19 caused by the voltage step @xmath20 is easily calculated as @xmath21 .",
    "here we chose the simple but well established @xcite energy conversion based on the geometric lever arm @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "for small excitation voltages @xmath20 this allows us to derive the density of states in the dot layer @xmath23 from the measured total change in conductivity @xmath24 from : @xmath25 where @xmath8 is the mobility of the 2deg , and @xmath26 is the change in the 2deg carrier density , caused by the tunneling electrons @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3](b ) shows the thus obtained density of states in the dot layer .",
    "we observe two clearly distinct maxima , corresponding to the charging of the two @xmath27-states around @xmath28 v and a broader distribution , corresponding to the charging of the four @xmath0-states in the range between @xmath29 and @xmath30 v. the peaks are broadened because of the size distribution of the self - assembled quantum dots . on samples with even better size homogeneity , the four @xmath0-states can also be clearly resolved @xcite .     while charging ( @xmath31 ) and discharging ( @xmath32 ) the first electron ( @xmath33  v ) .",

    "turning to the dynamics of the tunneling process , we find a significant difference for the charging compared to the discharging process as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] , the ratio between the charging and discharging relaxation rate decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this raises two questions : 1 ) what is the physical origin of this asymmetry and 2 ) how can this asymmetry be used to gain insight in the internal structure of the quantum dots ? to answer both questions we model the charge relaxation after the voltage pulse within a master - equation approach .",
    "at first glance , an asymmetry between charging and discharging the dots may appear counter intuitive . after all , fermi s golden rule @xcite @xmath43 for the transition rate from an initial state @xmath44 to a ( fixed ) final state @xmath45 is symmetric , @xmath46 , as a consequence of the hermiticity of the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath47 and energy conservation which ensures that the ( many - body ) density of states for the initial and the final state are equal to each other ( here practically given by the density of states of the 2deg ) . the dependence of @xmath48 on the quantum - dot energy level @xmath49 reflects the energy dependence of the tunnel amplitudes ( density of states of the 2deg is practically energy independent ) .",
    "we describe the charge dynamics by a master equation @xcite @xmath50 in terms of the quantum - dot charge @xmath11 ( and its probability @xmath51 ) , which contains only partial information of the initial and final many - body states .",
    "the 2deg degrees of freedom and the @xmath52-fold ( spin and/or orbital ) degeneracy of the quantum - dot state with @xmath11 electrons are integrated out . averaging the fermi - golden - rule expression @xmath48 over all initial and summing over all final states with the given quantum - dot charge yields the transition rates @xmath53 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fermi function @xmath54 stems from the average over the 2deg occupation .",
    "only transitions with @xmath55 need to be taken into account , because the electron - electron interaction energy ( coulomb blockade ) is much larger than both the thermal energy and the excitation energy induced by the voltage pulse .",
    "the integer @xmath56 counts how many quantum - dot states with charge @xmath57 can be reached from each of the states with charge @xmath11 . due to selection rules , @xmath56 may be smaller than the degeneracy @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , their ratios are equal , @xmath59    let us consider the @xmath11-th charge transition for an individual quantum dot . from the master equations for the probabilities @xmath60 , we obtain the kinetic equation for the average charge @xmath61 , @xmath62 which is solved by @xmath63 with the relaxation time @xmath64 given by @xmath65 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath66 , and the equilibrium occupation @xmath67 we would like to mention that for a given ( fixed ) final state energy @xmath68 , the relaxation time @xmath64 does _ not _ distinguish between charging and discharging , i.e. , whether the initial charge @xmath69 was larger or smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "experimentally , on the other hand , the applied gate voltage pulse changes the energy @xmath68 of the quantum dot by a small amount @xmath19 . for small voltage pulses ,",
    "the energy dependence of the tunnel barrier can be neglected , i.e. , @xmath71 . however , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) even a small change in @xmath68 can have a strong influence on the tunneling time when two conditions are fulfilled : ( 1 ) the temperature is small ( @xmath72 ) , so that the fermi function @xmath45 has a steep slope near @xmath68 and ( 2 ) the degeneracies of the charging states @xmath11 and @xmath73 are different , so that @xmath74 .    for example , at the transition @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",

    ", we should emphasize again the importance of the charging energy .",
    "for negligible charging energy , the charging and discharging of each quantum dot level ( with orbital and spin degree of freedom ) is independent of the other levels .",
    "therefore , degeneracies would not play any role , @xmath79 , and the relaxation time would be energy independent .",
    "the finite asymmetry is , therefore , a clear signature of coulomb interaction .",
    "a similar conclusion has been drawn from measurements of the width of tunneling resonances in quantum dots that are asymmetrically coupled to source and drain electrodes @xcite . there",
    "the dependence of the width on the polarity of the applied bias voltage could also be traced back to the energy dependence of @xmath80 $ ] . on the other hand , identical relaxation times for charging and discharging have been recently observed on an electrostatically - defined quantum dot , coupled to a large top - gate capacitance ( such that , the charging energy is negligible ) @xcite .    for an individual quantum dot or an ensemble with a sharp distribution of the quantum - dot resonances , asymmetric charge - relaxation times",
    "can only be observed when the final gate voltage after the voltage pulse for charging is _ different _ from the one for discharging , such that the corresponding quantum - dot level positions are separated by at least @xmath81 . in our sample , however , the opposite limit of a rather broad distribution is realized . to describe this case ,",

    "the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to charging ( discharging ) .",
    "the pre - exponential factor in the integrand selects only those quantum dots which change their occupation after the voltage pulse .",
    "an asymmetry of the relaxation times now appears because relative to the fermi energy , the dot energies lie by @xmath19 lower for charging than for discharging .",
    "due to the energy integral , the charge relaxation is no longer governed by a single exponential decay . to characterize the relaxation by a single time constant",
    ", we numerically perform an exponential fit of eq .",
    "( [ occ ] ) .",
    "we quantify the asymmetry in the charge relaxation time by the ratio @xmath85 for the reasons discussed above , @xmath86 is a function of temperature .",
    "it ranges from @xmath87 for @xmath88 to @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "let us now consider the first two transitions @xmath75 and @xmath91 for filling the @xmath27-shell with the first and the second electron , respectively .",
    "spin degeneracy implies @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath92 , which yields @xmath93 and @xmath94 . due to finite temperature , @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "should be closer to @xmath89 than @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , we measure @xmath99 and @xmath100 at @xmath101 .",
    "deviations from the expected relation @xmath102 may be attributed to an energy dependence of the tunneling barrier @xmath48 .",
    "this effect can be accounted for by averaging @xmath95 and @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "a temperature - dependent comparison between measured and calculated values of @xmath105 is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "quantitatively , the measured values of @xmath106 are somewhat smaller than the calculated ones .",
    "a better agreement can be achieved by assuming a higher electron temperature , caused by ohmic heating of the 2deg through the measurement current and the voltage pulse .",

    "now , we turn to the filling sequence up to the sixth electron occupying the @xmath0-shell of the quantum dots . even though for electrons , the @xmath110 shell filling sequence has been verified repeatedly @xcite , it was not quite clear whether hund s rule applies to the filling of the @xmath0-shell @xcite or whether it is lifted by an anisotropy of the confinement potential in the dot @xcite .",

    "since the separation of the charging states in the @xmath0-shell is comparable to the inhomogeneous width of the qd ensemble , different transitions may occur during a single switch in energy . to account for this overlap",
