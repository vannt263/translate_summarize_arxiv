    "visualization has always been an important ingredient for communicating mathematics @xcite .",
    "figures and models have helped to express ideas even before formal mathematical language was able to describe the structures .",
    "numbers have been recorded as marks on bones , represented with pebbles , then painted onto stone , inscribed into clay , woven into talking knots , written onto papyrus or paper , then printed on paper or displayed on computer screens .",
    "while figures extend language and pictures allow to visualize concepts , realizing objects in space has kept its value . already in ancient greece ,",
    "wooden models of apollonian cones were used to teach conic sections .",
    "early research in mathematics was often visual : figures on babylonian clay tablets illustrate pythagorean triples , the moscow mathematical papyrus features a picture which helps to derive the volume formula for a frustum .",
    "al - khwarizmi drew figures to solve the quadratic equation .",
    "visualization is not only illustrative , educational or heuristic , it has practical value : pythagorean triangles realized by ropes helped measuring and dividing up of land in babylonia .",
    "ruler and compass , introduced to construct mathematics on paper , can be used to build plans for machines .",
    "greek mathematicians like apollonius , aristarchus , euclid or archimedes mastered the art of representing mathematics with figures @xcite .",
    "visual imagination plays an important role in extending geometrical knowledge @xcite .",
    "while pictures do not replace proofs - @xcite gives a convincing visual proof that all triangles are equilateral - they help to transmit intuition about results and ideas @xcite .",
    "the visual impact on culture is well documented @xcite .",
    "visualization is especially crucial for education and can lead to new insight .",
    "many examples of mechanical nature are in the textbook @xcite . as a pedagogical tool",
    ", it assists teachers on any level of mathematics , from elementary and high school over higher education to modern research @xcite .",
    "a thesis of @xcite has explored the feasibility of the technology in the classroom .",
    "we looked at work of archimedes @xcite using this technology .",
    "visualizations helps also to showcase the beauty of mathematics and to promote the field to a larger public .",
    "figures can inspire new ideas , generate new theorems or assist in computations ; examples are feynman or dynkin diagrams or young tableaux .",
    "most mathematicians draw creative ideas and intuition from pictures , even so these figures often do not make it into papers or textbooks .",
    "artists @xcite , architects @xcite , film makers , engineers and designers draw inspiration from visual mathematics . well illustrated books like @xcite advertise mathematics with figures and illustrations .",
    "such publications help to counterbalance the impression that mathematics is difficult to communicate to non - mathematicians .",
    "mathematical exhibits like at the science museum in boston or the museum of math in new york play an important role in making mathematics accessible .",
    "they all feature visual or even hands - on realizations of mathematics . while various technologies have emerged which allow to display spacial and dynamic content on the web , like javascript , java , flash , wrml , svg or webgl , the possibility to * manipulate an object with our bare hands * is still unmatched .",
    "3d printers allow us to do that with relatively little effort .",
    "the industry of rapid prototyping and 3d printing in particular emerged about 30 years ago @xcite and is by some considered part of an * industrial revolution * in which manufacturing becomes digital , personal , and affordable @xcite . first commercialized in 1994 with printed wax material , the technology has moved to other materials like acrylate photopolymers or metals and is now entering the range of consumer technology .",
    "printing services can print in color , with various materials and in high quality .",
    "the development of 3d printing is the latest piece in a chain of visualization techniques .",
    "we live in an exciting time , because we experience not only one revolution , but two revolutions at the same time : an information revolution and an industrial revolution .",
    "these changes also affect mathematics education @xcite .",
    "3d printing is now used in the medical field , the airplane industry , to prototype robots , to create art and jewelry , to build nano structures , bicycles , ships , circuits , to produce art , robots , weapons , houses and even used to decorate cakes .",
    "its use in education was investigated in @xcite .",
    "since physical models are important for hands - on active learning @xcite , 3d printing technology in education has been used since a while @xcite and considered for @xcite sustainable development , for k-12 education in stem projects @xcite as well as elementary mathematics education @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that it will have a huge impact in education @xcite .",
    "printed models allow to illustrate concepts in various mathematical fields like calculus , geometry or topology .",
    "it already has led to new prospects in mathematics education .",
    "the literature about 3d printing explodes , similar as in computer literature expanded , when pcs entered the consumer market .",
    "examples of books are @xcite . as for any emerging technology , these publications",
    "might be outdated quickly , but will remain a valuable testimony of the exciting time we live in .",
    "the way we think about mathematics influences our teaching @xcite .",
    "images and objects can influence the way we think about mathematics . to illustrate visualizations using 3d printers ,",
    "our focus is on mathematical models generated with the help of * computer algebra systems*. unlike * 3d modelers * , mathematical software has the advantage that the source code is short and that programs used to illustrate mathematics for research or the classroom can be reused .",
    "many of the examples given here have been developed for classes or projects and redrawn so that it can be printed .",
    "in contrast to  modelers \" , software which generate a large list of triangles , computer algebra systems describe and display three dimensional objects mathematically . while we experimented also with other software like",
    " 123d design \" from autodesk ,  sketchup \" from trimble , the modeler  free cad \" ,  blender \" , or  rhinoceros `` by mcneel accociates , we worked mostly with computer algebra systems and in particular with mathematica @xcite . to explain this with a concrete example ,",
    "lets look at a * theorem of newton on sphere packing * which tells that * the kissing number of spheres in three dimensional space is 12 . *",
    "the theorem tells that the maximal number of spheres we can be placed around a given sphere is twelve , if all spheres have the same radius , touch the central sphere and do not overlap . while newton s contemporary gregory thought that one can place a thirteenth sphere ,",
    "newton believed the kissing number to be 12 .",
    "the theorem was only proved in 1953 @xcite . to show that the kissing number is at least 12 , take an icosahedron with side length @xmath0 and place unit spheres at each of the 12 vertices then they kiss the unit sphere centered at the origin . the proof that it is impossible to place 13 spheres @xcite uses an elementary estimate @xcite for the area of a spherical triangle , the euler polyhedron formula , the discrete gauss - bonnet theorem assuring that the sum of the curvatures is @xmath0 and some combinatorics to check through all cases of polyhedra , which are allowed by these constraints . in order to visualize the use of mathematica",
    ", we plotted 12 spheres which kiss a central sphere . while the object consists of 13 spheres only , the entire solid",
    "is made of 8640 triangles .",
    "the mathematica code is very short because we only need to compute the vertex coordinates of the icosahedron , generate the object and then export the stl file . by displaying the source code",
    ", we have * illustrated the visualization * , similar than communicating proof . if fed into the computer , the code generates a printable ' ' stl `` or ' ' x3d \" file .",
    "physical models are important for hands - on active learning",
    ". repositories of 3d printable models for education have emerged @xcite .",
    "3d printing technology has been used for k-12 education in stem projects @xcite , and elementary mathematics education @xcite .",
    "there is optimism that it will have a large impact in education @xcite .",
    "the new technology allows everybody to build models for the classroom - in principle . to make it more accessible",
    ", many hurdles still have to be taken .",
    "there are some good news : the stl files can be generated easily because the format is simple and open .",
    "stl files can also be exported to other formats .",
    "mathematica for example allows to import it and convert it to other forms .",
    "programs like  meshlab \" allow to manipulate it .",
    "terminal conversions like  admesh \" allow to deal with stl files from the command line .",
    "other stand - alone programs like  stl2pov \" allow to convert it into a form which can be rendered in a ray tracer like povray .",
    "one major point is that good software to generate the objects is not cheap .",
    "the use of a commercial computer algebra system like mathematica can be costly , especially if a site licence is required .",
    "there is no free computer algebra software available now , which is able to export stl or 3ds or wrl files with built in routines .",
    "the computer algebra system sage , which is the most sophisticated open source system , has only export in experimental stage @xcite .",
    "it seems that a lot of work needs to be done there .",
    "many resources are available however @xcite .",
    "the following illustrations consist of mathematica graphics which could be printed .",
    "this often needs adaptation because a printer can not print objects of zero thickness .",
    "the first table summarizes information and industrial revolutions . +         + of course , these snapshots are massive simplifications .",
    "these tables hope to illustrate the fast - paced time we live in .",
    "+ * remarks and acknowledgements*. the april 7 2013 , version of this document has appeared in @xcite .",
    "we added new part f)-n ) in the last section as well as the last 16 graphics examples as well as a couple of more code examples and references .",
