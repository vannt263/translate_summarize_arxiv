    "indeed , our integrals are generating functions for the cardinality of the _ representation variety _ of a surface group in a finite group .",
    "the non - commutative matrix integrals of this article have their origin in _ random matrix theory _ ( cf .",

    "the feynman diagram expansion formula we establish is the following : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a normalized lebesgue measure on the real vector subspace of @xmath0 consisting of self - adjoint elements , @xmath14 is the ribbon graph automorphism group , and @xmath15 is the number of @xmath16-valent vertices of the connected ribbon graph @xmath7 .",

    "since the generating functions for the hurwitz numbers and the gromov - witten invariants of the riemann surfaces are proven to satisfy integrable systems @xcite , the integrability of the von neumann algebra integrals seems to pose a condition on the structure of the algebra .",

    "@xmath64 is the center of the group @xmath40 that acts trivially on the representation variety through conjugation .",
    "it is interesting to note that exactly the same formulas ( [ eq : med ] ) and ( [ eq : fscount ] ) hold for a compact lie group if the infinite sum of lhs converges absolutely and the cardinality is interpreted as the _ volume _ of the variety in an appropriate sense .",
    "the naive extension of the method of this article does not work for the case of lie groups , however , because the von neumann algebra involved becomes infinite - dimensional and the integration ( [ eq : introcgexp ] ) makes no sense .",
