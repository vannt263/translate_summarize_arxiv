    "super - kamiokande ( sk ) is a water cherenkov detector in kamioka , japan .",
    "solar neutrino data were collected at sk from may 31st , 1996 to july 15th , 2001 yielding a total detector live time of 1,496 days ( sk - i ) .",
    "the solar neutrino signal is extracted from the data using the angular deviation between the sun and the reconstructed direction of events @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath0(stat . ) solar neutrino interactions were observed in 22.5 ktons of fiducial volume .",
    "the relatively high yield of real - time events in sk , 15 events per day , allows a search for short - time periodic modulations in the observed neutrino fluxes .",
    "the solar neutrino data , selected over 1,871 elapsed days from the beginning of data - taking , are divided into roughly 10-day long samples .",
    "the time period of each 10-day sample is chosen from consecutive 10-day periods from may 31st , 1996 through july 15 , 2001 .",
    "there are on and off periods of data - taking in the 10-day interval and thus the timing of each sample is calculated as a mean of the start and end times and corrected by sk livetime .",
    "fig.[fig:10day ] ( left ) shows the measured solar neutrino fluxes of the 10-day samples .",
    "all given uncertainties are statistical .",
    "the 1/@xmath1 ( squared average distance in a.u . ) variation caused by the eccentricity of the earth s orbit around the sun is corrected for the measured solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "the lomb periodogram method , a spectral analysis for unevenly sampled data , is applied to search for possible periodicities in the measured 10-day long fluxes .",
    "the method finds periodicities based on maximum deviation of data relative to a constant in time .",
    "a detailed description of the method can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the maximum power appears at frequency f=0.0726 day@xmath2 ( or time period t=13.76 days ) with lomb power 7.51 corresponding to 81.70% c.l .    as a consistency check for the confidence level ,",
    "10,000 mc experiments are generated based on the observed timing information and the measured solar neutrino fluxes of the 10-day long data samples .",
    "the measured solar neutrino flux values are simulated according to a random gaussian fluctuation .",
    "for making these null modulation samples the average of the measured fluxes ( @xmath3 @xmath4 s@xmath2 ) is taken as a gaussian mean , and the standard deviation of the the measured flux ( @xmath5 @xmath4 s@xmath2 ) is taken as a gaussian error @xcite .",
    "the lomb method is applied to each mc experiment to obtain a periodogram and the maximum power is selected . out of 10,000 simulated experiments ,",
    "19.58% have maximum powers larger than 7.51 .",
    "this demonstrates that the confidence level for the t=13.76 day period of sk data is consistent with that of no modulation .",
    "we have studied the sensitivity of the sk - i solar neutrino data to find if a true periodicity indeed exists .",
    "the details of this sensitivity study can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of finding the correct period varies rapidly near the sampling time periods of 10 @xmath6 20 days . based on the mc study",
    ", the lomb method is expected to find the true periodicity of the sk - i data , if any , with an efficiency of 95% at a modulation amplitude of 10% of the averaged flux and a period of longer than 40 days in case of the 10-day long sample .",
    "we have presented the measured solar neutrino fluxes of 10-day long samples using all 1,496 days of sk data .",
    "no significant periodicity was found in the sk solar neutrino data when a search was made to look for periodic modulations of the observed fluxes using the lomb method .",
    "based on a mc study , we have obtained the probability of finding a true periodicity in the sk data as a function of the modulation magnitude .",
    "the lomb method should have found a periodic modulation in the sk - i solar neutrino data of 10-day long samples if the modulation period were longer than 40 days and its magnitude was larger than 10% of the average measured neutrino fluxes ."
