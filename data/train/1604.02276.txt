    "be stars are non - supergiant b - type stars with balmer emission lines , especially the h@xmath0 lines .",
    "be stars are also characterized by their fast rotation , color excess at infrared wavelength , and continuum / emission - line variability @xcite .",
    "some be stars show the variability with periods that might be due to pulsation or rotation @xcite .",
    "previous studies have found the enhancement of be phenomenon in young clusters @xcite , while @xcite showed an overall increase in be frequency with age until 100 myr .",
    "@xcite also indicated that be star formation is not strongly related to the cluster density .",
    "furthermore , the be star fraction in open clusters seems to be increasing with lower metallicity ; between 17.5% and 40% of b stars were found to be be stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( see detailed review in * ? ? ?",
    "it is well accepted that the h@xmath0 emissions of be stars originate from the circumstellar material , which is suggested to be a flattened disk @xcite .",
    "the disks are found to be in keplerian rotation and stable @xcite .",
    "the material might be moved from the stellar surface to form the circumstellar disk ( e.g. , the decretion disk ) through the combination of fast rotation and other mechanisms , such as nonradial pulsations or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there are several possible origins of the fast rotating star : ( 1 ) binary interaction @xcite . during the interaction process",
    ", mass and angular momentum can be transferred from the primary star to the mass gainer star , and the latter might be spun - up to a fast rotating star ; ( 2 ) they might be born as fast rotators ; and ( 3 ) they have been spun - up during the main - sequence ( ms ) evolution .    to further understand the nature of be stars , several surveys of be stars have been carried out in the past @xcite . because stars in clusters share age and metallicity , be stars in a sample of clusters with different ages play an essential role in the study of their evolution .",
    "previous studies have searched for emission - line objects in a number of star clusters in the smc and mw .",
    "particularly , @xcite provided the most extensive survey of be stars in the mw ; they investigated 55 clusters and concluded that @xmath3 of the rapid rotators might be spun - up by the effect of mass transfer between binaries .",
    "moreover , @xcite also showed that the distributions of projected rotational velocity of be stars and normal b - type stars are significantly different , indicating that they might be different stellar populations , and be stars can not be drawn from a sample of normal b stars .",
    "theoretical simulations also imply that most be stars could be formed during the phase of binary interactions @xcite .",
    "these studies further supported a spin - up scheme for the evolutionary sequence of be stars .",
    "nevertheless , the sample of be stars in open clusters is far from complete due to several difficulties : ( 1 ) a comprehensive spectroscopic survey is time consuming , ( 2 ) spectroscopic surveys are often limited to bright stars .",
    "therefore , with the wide field of view ( 7.3 square degree ) of the 48 inch samuel oschin telescope , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) project provides an efficient way to search for emission - line candidates in open clusters using h@xmath0 imaging photometry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a new instrument called the sed - machine @xcite provides a possible solution for the fast and efficient follow - up spectroscopic observations for the emission - line candidates found in ptf , because the highly efficient sed - machine is designed to classify transient events rapidly with a low resolution ( @xmath4/@xmath5@xmath6100 ) integrated field unit ( ifu ) spectrograph that covers a large wavelength range ( 370 to 920  nm ) .",
    "thus , a comprehensive survey of be stars in star clusters can be accomplished with a combination of the ptf h@xmath0 imaging photometry and the sed - machine .",
    "here we present the results of searching for be stars in an open cluster ngc6830 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "ngc6830 , located at a distance of 1.8  kpc @xcite in the constellation vulpecula @xcite , has a fairly loose structure .",
    "in contrast to our previous work ( ngc 663 with an age of @xmath8  myrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the age of ngc6830 is about 125  myrs @xcite and only one be star has been reported in this cluster @xcite prior to our work . using the relation of effective temperature and age",
    ", @xcite determined that the age of ngc6830 is log(age ) = 7.69 yr ( 48.9 myrs ) with the hottest star ( 17,000 k ) in the membership of 19 stars .",
    "it seems that the age given by @xcite is not consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "however , while the membership in @xcite is only determined from the distance , @xcite included the proper motions ( pms ) to determine the membership and give the log(age ) = 8.105@xmath90.062 yr ( 125  myrs ) .",
    "furthermore , the range of the effective temperature for the membership in @xcite is from 12,000 to 17,000 k , indicating the log(age ) is between 7.69 and 8.22 yr , which is also consistent with the age given by @xcite .",
    "thus , here we adopted the age given by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the age difference , we selected ngc6830 as the subject of this work because the known be star is fairly bright and hence it is suitable to be observed with the sed - machine during its commissioning runs .",
    "therefore , the main goal of this work is to demonstrate the capability of the combined ptf h@xmath0 imaging photometry , the archival 2mass and proper motions data , and the sed - machine in the search of be stars in open clusters .",
    "this will lay the foundation of our future work in this area . in section  2 ,",
    "we describe the methodology of identifying emission - line stars and determination of cluster membership using the ptf h@xmath0 imaging photometry . in section  3 and  4",
    ", we describe our spectroscopic observations and present our results based on these observations .",

    "because about 10% objects in ppmxl data include spurious entries @xcite , @xcite have averaged their pms and computed errors .",

    "the ew[h@xmath0 ] of the be stars in ngc6830 are all @xmath1 @xmath210 , suggesting the disc fraction @xmath39 @xmath37 0.03 .",
    "the result is consistent with @xcite , who showed that most late - type be stars ( b4  b7 ) have @xmath39 @xmath37 0.1 , while most early - type be stars ( b1  b3 ) have @xmath39 @xmath1 0.1 .",
    "several mechanisms might cause long - term variability in be stars : ( 1 ) long - lived strong outbursts @xcite ; ( 2 ) decline of brightness due to cooling envelope @xcite ; ( 3 ) weak brightness change related to h@xmath0 variability .",
    "the brightness of ngc6830 - 1 and ngc6830 - 2 allow us to investigate the variability with the amplitude larger than 0.15 mag using asas data set .",
    "we do not discover any significant variability for ngc6830 - 1 and ngc6830 - 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous studies ; @xcite showed that only 12% of b6-type be stars have the variability with the amplitude of 0.12 to 0.3 mag .",
    "because large amplitude caused by strong outbursts usually seen in earliest be stars , it is not surprised that we do not detect variability in these be stars .    finally , as a pilot project to search for be stars in clusters with different ages , we reviewed our selection criteria for ngc663 @xcite and this work .",
    "eight of 11 be candidates are classified as a- or g - type stars ; most of them have marginal h@xmath0 detection in the ha663@xmath2ha656 color diagram ( figure  2 )",
    ". this misidentification can be improved by using the 2mass color - color diagram .",
    "as shown in figure  1d , if we make the selection region ( dashed line ) to have similar range as the known be stars , most g - type stars would have been ruled out .",
    "thus , we will change our selection criteria in our future project .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the star ngc6830 - 9 has large h@xmath0 excess in figure  2 , while the optical spectrum suggested a g - type star with the h@xmath0 absorption line .",
    "this is caused by the contamination of residual cosmic - ray hitting on the target region , which is not easy to be eliminated .",
    "procedures of removing cosmic - ray around science targets will be performed carefully in the future project .",
    "we thank to the referee for her / his constructive comments .",
    "we are also grateful to the staff of lulin and lick observatory for helping the observations .",
