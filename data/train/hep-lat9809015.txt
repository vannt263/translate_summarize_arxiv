    "accurate knowledge of the properties of the stationary states of glue in the presence of the simplest of color sources , that of a static quark and antiquark separated by some distance @xmath0 , is an important stepping stone on the way to understanding confinement .",
    "it is generally believed that at large @xmath0 , the linearly - growing ground - state energy of the glue is the manifestation of the confining flux whose fluctuations can be described in terms of an effective string theory .",
    "the lowest - lying excitations are then the goldstone modes associated with spontaneously - broken transverse translational symmetry .",
    "expectations are less clear for small @xmath0 .",
    "the determination of the energies of glue in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair is also the first step in the born - oppenheimer treatment of conventional and hybrid heavy - quark mesons@xcite .",
    "a better understanding of hybrid quarkonium should provide valuable insight into the nature of light hybrid mesons , which are currently of great experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "even the simplest property , the energy spectrum , of the stationary states of glue interacting with a static quark - antiquark pair is not accurately known .",
    "the main goal of this work is to remedy this . here",
    ", we present , for the first time , a comprehensive determination of the low - lying spectrum of gluonic excitations in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair . in this initial study , the effects of light quark - antiquark pair creation are ignored .",
    "a few of the energy levels for @xmath0 less than 1 fm have been studied before@xcite .",
    "our results for these quantities have significantly improved precision , and we have extended the range in @xmath0 to 4 fm . most of the energy levels presented here have never been studied before . some of our results were previously reported@xcite .",
    "we adopt the standard notation from the physics of diatomic molecules and use @xmath2 to denote the magnitude of the eigenvalue of the projection @xmath3 of the total angular momentum @xmath4 of the gluons onto the molecular axis @xmath5 .",
    "the capital greek letters @xmath6 are used to indicate states with @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the combined operations of charge conjugation and spatial inversion about the midpoint between the quark and the antiquark is also a symmetry and its eigenvalue is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "states with @xmath9 are denoted by the subscripts @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "there is an additional label for the @xmath12 states ; @xmath12 states which are even ( odd ) under a reflection in a plane containing the molecular axis are denoted by a superscript @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the low - lying levels are labelled @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and so on . for convenience",
    ", we use @xmath23 to denote these labels in general .",
    "the glue energies @xmath24 were extracted from monte carlo estimates of generalized wilson loops .",
    "the expectation value of the path - ordered exponential of the gauge field along a closed loop is known as a wilson loop .",
    "the familiar static - quark potential @xmath25 can be obtained from the large-@xmath26 behaviour @xmath27 $ ] of the wilson loop for a rectangle of spatial length @xmath0 and temporal extent @xmath26 .",
    "the two spatial segments of such a wilson loop can be replaced by a complicated _ sum _ of spatial paths , all sharing the same starting and terminating sites , in order to extract the @xmath24 energies , as long as the sum of paths transforms as @xmath23 under all symmetry operations . using several different sums of paths ( we typically use 3 to 22 such sums ) then produces a matrix of wilson loop correlators @xmath28 .",
    "monte carlo estimates of the @xmath28 matrices were obtained in eight simulations using an improved gauge - field action@xcite .",
    "our use of anisotropic lattices in which the temporal lattice spacing @xmath29 was much smaller than the spatial spacing @xmath30 was crucial for resolving the glue spectrum , particularly for large @xmath0 . to hasten the onset of asymptotic behaviour",
    ", iteratively - smeared spatial links@xcite were used in the generalized wilson loops .",
    "the temporal segments in the wilson loops were constructed from thermally - averaged links , whenever possible , to reduce statistical noise . to facilitate the removal of finite - spacing errors by extrapolating to the continuum limit , results for several values of the lattice spacing were obtained ; simulations were done using @xmath31 , and @xmath32 fm .",
    "two runs corresponding to the same @xmath30 but different @xmath29 were done to provide a measure of the @xmath33 errors in our results ( our action has @xmath34 errors ) .",
    "such information is important for carrying out the @xmath35 extrapolations .",
    "agreement of energies obtained using different quark - antiquark orientations on the lattice was used to check the smallness of finite - spacing errors and to help identify the continuum @xmath2 value corresponding to each level ( there are only discrete symmetries on the lattice ) .",
    "for this reason , results were obtained not only for cases in which the molecular axis coincided with an axis of the lattice , but also for separation vectors such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the matrices @xmath28 were reduced in the data fitting phase to single correlators and @xmath38 correlation matrices using the variational method .",
    "the lowest - lying glue energies were then extracted from these reduced correlators by fitting a single exponential and a sum of two exponentials , the expected asymptotic forms , in various ranges @xmath39 to @xmath40 of the source - sink separation .",
    "the two - exponential fits were used to check for consistency with the single - exponential fits , and in cases of favourable statistics , to extract the first - excited state energy in a given channel .",
    "three additional runs on small lattices were done to verify that finite - volume errors in our results were negligible .",
    "we confirmed the smallness of the @xmath41 renormalization for two values of the qcd coupling by extracting the ground state potential from wilson loops in different orientations .",
    "the hadronic scale parameter @xmath42 fm was used to determine the lattice spacing@xcite .",
    "the additive ultraviolet - divergent self - energies of the static sources were removed by expressing all of our results with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "finite - lattice spacing errors were removed by extrapolating our simulation results for @xmath44 $ ] to the @xmath35 continuum limit .",
    "these extrapolations were carried out by fitting all of our simulation results to an ansatz @xmath45 : a ratio of a polynomial of degree @xmath46 over a polynomial of degree @xmath47 , where @xmath48 or @xmath49 , was found to work well for the continuum limit form @xmath50 , and @xmath51 was chosen empirically to be a sum of three terms @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "all fits yielded @xmath55 near unity .",
    "continuum @xmath2 values were easily identified in all cases but one : we were unable to distinguish between a @xmath56 and @xmath57 interpretation for the on - axis @xmath58 level .",
    "our continuum - limit extrapolations are shown in fig .  [ fig : res ] .",
    "the ground - state @xmath15 is the familiar static - quark potential .",
    "a linearly - rising behaviour dominates the @xmath15 potential once @xmath0 exceeds about 0.5 fm and we find no deviations from the linear form up to 4 fm .",
    "the lowest - lying excitation is the @xmath20 .",
    "there is definite evidence of a band structure at large @xmath0 : the @xmath59 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 form the first band above the @xmath20 ; the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath60 , and @xmath22 form another band .",
    "the @xmath16 is the highest level at large @xmath0 .",
    "this band structure breaks down as @xmath0 decreases below 2 fm .",
    "in particular , two levels , the @xmath16 and @xmath18 , drop far below their large-@xmath0 partners as @xmath0 becomes small .",
    "note that for @xmath0 above 0.5 fm , all of the excitations shown are stable with respect to glueball decay . as @xmath0 decreases below 0.5 fm , the excited levels eventually become unstable as their gaps above the ground state @xmath15 exceed the mass of the lightest glueball .",
    "a universal feature of any low - energy description of a thin fluctuating flux tube is the presence of goldstone excitations associated with the spontaneously - broken transverse translational symmetry .",
    "these transverse modes have energy separations above the ground state given by multiples of @xmath1 .",
    "the level orderings and approximate degeneracies of the gluon energies at large @xmath0 match , without exception , those expected of the goldstone modes . however , the precise @xmath61 gap behaviour is not observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) . for separations",
    "less than 2 fm , the gluon energies lie well below the goldstone energies and the goldstone degeneracies are no longer observed .",
    "the two @xmath62 states are in violent disagreement with expectations from a fluctuating string .",
    "the gluon energies also can not be explained in terms of a nambu - goto string ( whose quantization in four dimensions is problematical , besides ) .",
    "these results are rather surprising .",
    "our results cast serious doubts on the validity of treating glue in terms of a fluctuating string for quark - antiquark separations less than 2 fm .",
    "note that such a conclusion does not contradict the fact that the @xmath63 energy rises linearly for @xmath0 as small as 0.5 fm .",
    "a linearly - rising term is not necessarily indicative of a string : for example , the adiabatic bag model predicts a linearly - rising ground state much before the onset of string - like behaviour , even in the spherical approximation@xcite . for @xmath0",
    "greater than 2 fm , there are some tantalizing signatures of goldstone mode formation , yet significant disagreements still remain .",
    "to what degree these discrepancies can be explained in terms of a distortion of the goldstone mode spectrum arising from the spatial fixation of the quark and antiquark sources is currently under investigation .",
