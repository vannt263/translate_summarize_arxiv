    "( -10,45)@xmath8    this operation is called _ cork twisting _ , and it is now known  @xcite that any two smooth , closed , simply - connected @xmath1-manifolds that are homeomorphic differ by a single cork twist .",
    "it is not known whether the same cork can be used in all situations , i.e.  whether there exists a _ universal cork _ ; indeed it is conceivable , though unlikely , that the mazur cork is universal .    the property that the cork twist @xmath8 is an _ involution _ is interesting , indeed inherent in most constructions of corks to date , but it is not clear that it is fundamental to the relation between cork twists and other smooth @xmath1-manifold constructions .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether cutting and gluing by higher order diffeomorphisms of the boundary of a contractible submanifold of a @xmath1-manifold can change the underlying smooth structure . in this note",
    "we give an affirmative answer , producing examples of embeddings of contractible @xmath1-manifolds with twists of arbitrary finite order that alter the ambient smooth structure ; a different construction of such examples was given in a recent preprint of tange @xcite .",
    "in fact we show more : for suitable finite groups @xmath10 , there exist contractible @xmath1-manifolds with effective @xmath10-actions on the boundary that embed in closed @xmath1-manifolds so that twists corresponding to distinct elements of @xmath10 yield distinct smooth structures .",

    "we extend the notion of @xmath10-cork to the setting where the group @xmath10 is a subgroup of the mapping class group of the boundary ; see the end of section  [ s : equiv ] for details .",

    "we thank aim for its support for this and future endeavors .",
    "our results were announced at the 2016 joint mathematics meeting ; see  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we lay the groundwork for our proof of the existence of equivariant corks .",
    "most of the ideas discussed here are well known , but since we will use  corks \" in a broader sense than usual , and employ cork twists on multiple copies of boundary sums of embedded copies of the mazur cork , we must give careful definitions of the relevant notions .",
    "-.05 in -.05 in      extending the usual terminology , a _ cork _ will refer to any pair @xmath4 where @xmath2 is a smooth , compact , contractible @xmath1-manifold , and @xmath18 is an _",

    "these notions induce an equivalence relation on corks associated with the same underlying manifold : @xmath4 and @xmath22 are _ boundary equivalent _ if and only if @xmath23 is trivial , i.e.  @xmath24 extends over @xmath2 .      the _ boundary sum _",

    "conversely , given any nontrivial cork @xmath4 , akbulut and ruberman construct a pair of absolutely exotic structures on a contractible manifold related by twisting @xmath4 @xcite .",
