    "in this paper we write hydrodynamic equations for ideal fluid in terms of clebsch potentials @xcite .",
    "this representation admits one to integrate hydrodynamic equations and to obtain effective description of rotational stream flow .",
    "we have discovered unexpected fact that the effective description of the rotational flow can not be carried out without introduction of the clebsch potentials . in general , the problem of irrotational stream flow and that of rotational stream flow are stated differently .",
    "let us show this in example of stationary two - dimensional flow of incompressible fluid",
    ". in this case one of clebsch potentials may coincide with the stream function @xmath0 .",
    "the irrotational flow is described by the equation for stream function @xmath0@xmath1 where indices mean corresponding partial derivatives .",
    "for the rotational stationary two - dimensional flow the equation ( [ h1.1 ] ) transforms to the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some function of argument @xmath0 , describing the character and intensity of vorticity .",
    "the obtained equation distinguishes from ( [ h1.1 ] ) in additional term .",
    "both equations ( [ h1.1 ] ) and ( [ h1.1a ] ) are the elliptic type equations . to obtain a unique solution of equation ( [ h1.1 ] ) ,",
    "it is sufficient to give value of the stream function @xmath0 on the boundary @xmath4 of the volume @xmath5 , where the flow is considered . the same is valid for equation ( [ h1.1a ] ) , provided the form of the function @xmath3 is known .",
    "but the value of @xmath0 on @xmath4 does not admit one to determine the form of the function @xmath3 .",
    "for determination of @xmath3 one needs some additional information , given on the boundary @xmath4 .    to state the problem of the rotational stream flow , it is necessary to determine what kind of information on the boundary is sufficient for derivation of the unique solution of equation ( [ h1.1a ] ) .",
    "theory of rotational flows can not exist without statement of this problem .",
    "unfortunately , we have not seen in literature a statement of the problem of the rotational stream flow , we know only single exact solutions @xcite .",
    "it means that the theory of rotational flows does not exist .",
    "equation ( [ h1.1 ] ) is a special case of equation ( [ h1.1a ] ) , when @xmath6 .",
    "equation ( [ h1.1a ] ) is obtained from the conventional hydrodynamic equations for two - dimensional stationary flow of incompressible fluid , which have the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are velocity components along @xmath10-axis and @xmath11-axis respectively . introducing the stream function @xmath0@xmath12",
    "we satisfy the first equation ( [ h1.2a ] ) identically .",
    "the second equation ( [ h1.2a ] ) takes the form @xmath13 relation ( [ h1.1a ] ) is the general solution @xmath14 of ( [ h1.2c ] ) , where @xmath15 is an arbitrary function of @xmath0 .    the goal of the present paper is the statement of the problem of the rotational stream flow .",
    "the problem is solved effectively in terms of the generalized stream function ( gsf ) which has several components .",
    "gsf is a generalization of the usual stream function @xmath0 for two - dimensional flow onto a more complicated @xmath16-dimensional case .",
    "unfortunately , in other more complicated cases the statement of the problem of the rotational flow needs a special well developed technique .",
    "this technique is based on application of jacobian technique to the descriptions of hydrodynamic equations written in terms of clebsch potentials .",
    "we shall refer to this technique as the generalized stream function technique ( gsf - technique ) .",
    "use of jacobian technique in application to clebsch potentials goes back to papers by clebsch @xcite , who obtained his potentials dealing with jacobians . in contemporary hydrodynamics",
    "the clebsch potentials are considered formally without connection with the jacobian technique @xcite .",
    "clebsch potentials have also another names ( lagrangian coordinates , lagrangian variables @xcite , labels of fluid particles ) .",
    "there are several version of representation of clebsch potentials .",
    "elements of jacobian technique was used by many authors ( @xcite and many others ) .",
    "but in solution of the problem of streamline flow the jacobian technique is not used practically , as well as clebsch potentials .",
    "we are interested only in that version , which is connected with a use of jacobian technique ( gsf - technique ) .",
    "we use space - time symmetric version of the jacobian technique which appears to be simple and effective .",
    "it seems that the progress in the investigation of vortical flows is connected mainly with the developed jacobian technique used together with clebsch potentials ( gsf - technique ) .",
    "presentation of the gsf - technique can be found in @xcite , as well as in @xcite , where it is used for description of the fluid flow in terms of the wave functions .    why are clebsch potentials important in the statement of the problem on vortical stream flow ?",
    "the term @xmath3 in rhs of ( [ h1.1a ] ) describes vorticity . according to the kelvin s theorem on circulation",
    "the vorticity is  frozen in the fluid  , and vorticity travels together with the fluid .",
    "clebsch potentials ( labels of the fluid particles ) , as well as the generalized stream function ( gsf ) are also  frozen in the fluid  .",
    "they also travel together with the fluid and vorticity . as a result",
    "the clebsch potentials ( labels ) and the generalized stream function ( gsf ) appear to be an effective tool of the vorticity description .",
    "a rotational fluid flow has some properties which are absent in irrotational flows .    1 .",
    "consideration of the fluid displacement and a use of clebsch potentials describing this displacement is essential in rotational flows , because this displacement transfers vorticity , which influences the velocity field , whereas such a transport is of no importance in irrotational flows , where the vorticity vanishes .",
    "2 .   the boundary conditions for a rotational flow contain more information , than the boundary conditions for irrotational flow . this additional information is information on vorticity , which conserves in any ideal fluid .",
    "although the field of vorticity @xmath17 is determined by the velocity field @xmath18 , but it is valid only inside some 3-volume @xmath5 , where vorticity can be determined as a result of differentiation of the velocity field .",
    "on the boundary @xmath4 of 3-volume @xmath5 one can calculate only component of @xmath19 along the normal to @xmath20 components of vorticity @xmath19 tangent to @xmath4 must be given additionally .",
    "it means that additional ( as compared with the irrotational flow ) degrees of freedom appear in the rotational flow , and additional information in boundary conditions is necessary for their description .    the first property is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we present it here also .",
    "it is common practice to think that the problem of streamline flow can be solved by consideration of only euler system of equations @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pressure , and @xmath25 is the internal energy of an unit mass considered to be a function of the mass density @xmath26 and the entropy @xmath27 .",
    "the internal energy @xmath25 is an unique characteristic of the ideal fluid .",
    "displacement of the fluid particles ( i.e. their trajectories and the law of motion along them ) in the given velocity field @xmath18 is described by the equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a solution of the system ( [ b1.1])-([b1.3 ] ) .",
    "the equations ( [ b1.1 ] ) - ( [ b1.6 ] ) form the complete system of hydrodynamic equations , but the form of this system is not quite consistent , because dynamic variables @xmath30 in ( [ b1.1 ] ) - ( [ b1.3 ] ) are functions of @xmath31 , whereas @xmath32 in ( [ b1.6 ] ) is a function of @xmath33 and of the label @xmath34 of the fluid particle .",

    "if we use the complete system ( [ b1.1])-([b1.3 ] ) , ( [ b1.4 ] ) , we can always integrate it and reduce the number of dynamic equations .",
    "this integration is accompanied by appearance of three arbitrary functions @xmath40 of clebsch potentials @xmath34 in dynamic equations .",
    "these functions contain full information on initial and boundary conditions for the fluid flow .",
    "the integrated dynamic equation have different form for the irrotational and rotational flows .",
    "in particular , if @xmath41 , what corresponds to irrotational flow of barotropic fluid , the equations ( [ b1.4 ] ) , known as lin constraints @xcite , are not dynamic equations in the integrated system of dynamic equations , and the variables @xmath34 have no relation to calculation of the fluid flow . in general case of rotational flow , when @xmath42 identically , the equations ( [ b1.4 ] ) are dynamic equations for the fluid .",
    "we show this , as soon as the corresponding mathematical technique will be developed .    in the second section jacobian technique",
    "is considered .",
    "the third section is devoted to derivation of hydrodynamic equations of ideal fluid from the variational principle .",
    "the variational principle for incompressible fluid is considered in the fourth section . in the fifth section two - dimensional flow of incompressible fluid",
    "is described in terms of the generalized stream function . in the sixth section",
    "the inflow conditions for the stationary two - dimensional flow of incompressible fluid are introduced .",
    "the seventh section is devoted to stationary flow around an obstacle .",

    "the functions @xmath47 are supposed to be independent in the sense that @xmath48 .",
    "it is useful to consider the jacobian @xmath49 as 4-linear function of variables @xmath50 , @xmath51",
    ". then one can introduce derivatives of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "the derivative @xmath53 appears as a result of a replacement of @xmath54 by @xmath55 in the relation ( [ b2.1 ] ) .",

    "but it is a very effective procedure in the case of rotational flow , because it reduces the number of dynamic equations to be solved .",
    "the continuity equation ( [ b2.10 ] ) is used without approximation in all hydrodynamic models , and the change of variables @xmath83 described by ( [ b2.9 ] ) appears sometimes to be useful . in particular , in the case of two - dimensional established flow of incompressible fluid the generalized stream function @xmath34 reduces to one variable @xmath84 , known as the stream function . in this case",
