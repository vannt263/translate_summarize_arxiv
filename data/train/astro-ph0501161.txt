    "hydroxyl ( oh ) masers are found in high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "they trace the local velocity and magnetic field and therefore provide clues to understanding the physical conditions of material surrounding newly - formed high - mass stars . but an unanswered question is whether the physical conditions in masing regions are representative of the surrounding material . in order for oh masing to occur , a large column density of",
    "oh must have velocity coherence such that the velocity gradient along the amplification path of the masing clump does not exceed the masing linewidth . in principle",
    ", sufficient column density can be achieved in two ways .",
    "if a masing clump is much denser than the ambient gas , the total oh column density can be large even if the physical extent of the clump is not .",
    "alternatively , masing may occur along favored paths of velocity coherence even in a medium of homogeneous density .    while it is uncertain which of these two scenarios is prevalent , two pieces of evidence suggest that density enhancements may not be necessary for oh masing to occur .",
    "first , 13434 mhz oh _ absorption _ in w3(oh ) shows zeeman splitting indicating a line - of - sight magnetic field strength of 3.1 mg @xcite .",
    "vlbi measurements of 1665 and 1667 mhz oh _ masers _ in w3(oh ) imply similar magnetic field strengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetic field strength of collapsing ( or collapsed ) material scales as the density @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , a result supported both by theoretical modelling @xcite and observations of molecular clouds in various stages of collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the oh absorption and maser magnetic fields are comparable , this suggests that the density at masing sites is similar to that of the ambient cloud of oh . second , ammonia ( nh@xmath12 ) observations of w3(oh ) indicate that the density of material in the clumps of maser emission is roughly the same ( to within a factor of two ) as the density of the interclump material @xcite . since the velocity and extent of nh@xmath12 absorption is similar to that of the oh emission in w3(oh ) , it is a reasonable assumption that nh@xmath12 and oh exist in the same cloud of material .",
    "finally , @xcite , when modeling multi - transition oh observations of w3(oh ) , find that maser emission in certain lines and absorption in others can be explained for the same range of densities , between @xmath13 and a few times @xmath14 @xmath15 ( for a temperature of 150 k ) .    is w3(oh ) a special case , or is it representative of all interstellar oh maser sources ?",
    "in particular , is any density enhancement required for the onset of oh masing ?",
    "these are questions that motivated us to observe a wider range of sources than @xcite with the high sensitivity that the gbt can afford .",
    "the observations were performed on 2004 april 11 and 12 using the national radio astronomy observatory s robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) in green bank , wv .",
    "the gbt has an effective diameter of 100 m. observations were taken in both circular polarizations with the gregorian focus ku - band receiver .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was configured in 9-level mode to provide 8192 uniform - weighted spectral channels in each of two ifs covering a bandwidth of 12.5 mhz each , centered on 13441.4173 and 13434.6374 mhz , doppler - shifted to the lsr velocity of each source .",
    "these correspond to the frequencies of the @xmath5 and @xmath1 main - line @xmath0  transitions , respectively @xcite .",
    "each spectral channel had a resolution of 1.5 khz , corresponding to a resolution of 0.034 km  s@xmath9  in velocity space .",
    "thus , the 13433.982 mhz ( @xmath16 ) and 13442.072 mhz ( @xmath17 ) satellite lines were also in the observed frequency range . at these frequencies ,",
    "the fwhm beamwidth of the gbt is 55  and the gain is 1.7 k / jy .",
    "double beam switching was employed such that the source appeared in each of the dual beams alternately for a period of two minutes .",
    "the beams were separated by 330  in azimuth .",
    "dynamic pointing and focusing were used , and the pointing and focus were checked hourly as well as each time the telescope was pointed at a source .",
    "variable rain , heavy at times , fell throughout the data collection period . during the brief interludes without precipitation ,",
    "the ( non - zenith ) system temperature approached being receiver - limited at about 30  k. at times , the system temperature was over 100  k , due to heavy precipitation and low elevation angles .",
    "our sources were chosen according to two criteria .",
    "first , they must contain a strong background  region so that absorption might be observed .",
    "second , since it was our intent to compare the magnetic field strength in the oh gas seen in absorption with that seen in maser emission , we sought sources in which the masers indicated a uniform field distribution and eliminated any with a reversal of the line - of - sight direction of the magnetic field as determined from ground - state oh maser zeeman splitting @xcite .",
    "only about 10 sources observable at the latitude of the gbt meet these criteria .",
    "we observed the six sources listed in table [ source - table ] .",

    "the detection of the lcp and rcp masers centered at @xmath8  km  s@xmath9  is new .",
    "there is some ambiguity as to whether the lcp maser at @xmath27  km  s@xmath9  should be paired with the rcp maser at @xmath28 or @xmath29  km  s@xmath9 , but the former is more likely because the linewidth of the latter is much greater than for the lcp maser . in the @xmath1 transition , we find one zeeman pair implying a line - of - sight magnetic field component of 10.3 mg , consistent with the detection by @xcite .",
    "on  1 is the only other source in which we find @xmath0  masers .",
    "the @xmath5 maser at 14  km  s@xmath9  was also detected by @xcite , although their velocity resolution was insufficient to find measurable zeeman splitting .",
    "we do not see the strong ( 0.5 jy ) maser at @xmath40.13  km  s@xmath9  that they do ; however , we find evidence of a weak maser at @xmath30  km  s@xmath9  ( lcp ) and @xmath31  km  s@xmath9  ( rcp ) . while these lines are weak , we believe they are real .",
    "the peaks of the lcp and rcp lines are only @xmath32 and @xmath33 times the single - channel rms noise of 0.02  k , respectively , but the line widths are 8 times a single channel width . these masers can be interpreted either as @xmath34 lines at 0.3  km  s@xmath9  or as @xmath17 lines at 14.9  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the 1665 mhz ( @xmath35 ) masers in on  1 are grouped in two velocity ranges : 1 to 4  km  s@xmath9  and 10 to 16  km  s@xmath9  @xcite ; likewise , the 6035 mhz ( @xmath36 ) masers are seen from @xmath37 to 2  km  s@xmath9  and 13 to 16  km  s@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "thus , either the @xmath38 or @xmath17 interpretation of these maser lines is consistent with the ground - state oh maser velocities .",
    "nevertheless , two arguments suggest that the weak maser feature in on  1 is a maser in the @xmath5 transition .",
    "first , satellite - line emission in interstellar oh masers is generally weak compared to main - line masers .",
    "this is true in the @xmath35  lines , where the 1665 and 1667 mhz masers are typically much stronger than 1612 and 1720 mhz masers . in the @xmath36  lines ,",
    "strong masers are found in the 6035 and 6030 mhz main lines , but 6049 mhz satellite - line emission is weak and rare @xcite , while the 6016 mhz satellite line has not been seen in emission @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if photon trapping is important , inversion in the 6016 mhz satellite line may be impossible @xcite .",
    "as for the @xmath0  lines , while about a dozen masers have been found in the 13441 mhz main line transition , the 13434 mhz maser in w3(oh ) remains the single known maser in the other main line transition , despite two searches encompassing 77 distinct interstellar masing sources @xcite .",
    "empirically , this suggests that satellite - line @xmath0  masers should be extremely rare if they exist at all .",
    "second , due to a smaller zeeman coefficient , the magnetic field strength implied by a constant - velocity zeeman splitting is higher for satellite lines than for main lines . if the weak maser in on  1 is actually in the @xmath39 transition , the implied magnetic field is @xmath40  mg .",

    "( 4 ) masers are on average denser than the surrounding oh material , and thus the magnetic field strength is greater at masing sites than for the oh as a whole .",
    "the first explanation is possible for both these sources .",
    "while five @xmath35  maser zeeman pairs were found in vlba imaging of k3@xmath450 , they are all located on the periphery of the  region to the north and east .",
    "it is possible that the line - of - sight direction of the magnetic field reverses on the south or west side of the source . even if there is no reversal in k3@xmath450 , four of the five zeeman pairs found in the vlba images of the 1665 and 1667 mhz maser emission imply full ( unprojected ) magnetic field strengths less than the detectability limits in table [ zeeman - table ] @xcite .",
    "only one ground - state oh maser has been found in vlba imaging of g10.624@xmath40.385 .",
    "it would be a @xmath76 and @xmath77 detection for the @xmath1 and @xmath7 transitions , respectively , if the average line - of - sight magnetic field component in the region of the @xmath78 absorption were the same as the full three - dimensional magnetic field strength implied by zeeman splitting of the 1667 mhz maser .",
    "but with only one zeeman pair detected through synthesis imaging , it is impossible to conclude whether or not there exists a line - of - sight field reversal across the source .",
    "the second explanation simply states that if the magnetic field is inclined at a large angle to the line of sight , its projection along the line of sight may be insufficient to produce a detectable zeeman splitting in stokes v , for the case where the splitting is less than the linewidth . assuming that the magnetic field strength of 6.0  mg for the single zeeman pair detected with vlbi resolution in g10.624@xmath40.385 is a typical value for the source as a whole , the required inclination angle of the magnetic field to produce a line - of - sight component less than 1.2  mg is @xmath79 .",
    "if the magnetic field actually is inclined @xmath80 to the line of sight , the expected linear polarization fraction of the two @xmath81-components of the zeeman pair is @xmath82 @xcite . but",
    "no linear polarization is detected in the maser @xcite , ruling out a high inclination at the maser site , on the east side of the  region .",
    "linear polarization fractions consistent with inclination angles as large as @xmath83 are seen on the west side of the  region , although most masers imply inclination angles much smaller than this value . incomplete spatial coverage of oh masers across the source render it difficult to estimate with certainty the inclination angle averaged across the source , but it is almost certainly less than @xmath80 . thus , while @xmath84  mg in g10.624@xmath40.385 , the inclination angle is likely not large enough such that @xmath85  mg . still , an inclination angle smaller than @xmath80 in combination with another factor ( such as a field reversal across the source ) may suffice to reduce the average line - of - sight magnetic field strength below our detection threshold .",
    "the third explanation is unlikely because a higher temperature is required to populate the @xmath0  states than for either the @xmath86 or @xmath73 states .",
    "these higher temperatures likely require that the distribution of oh in the @xmath68 states be peaked closer to the central heat source than for the @xmath74 and @xmath73 states , as is noted for masers in w3(oh ) @xcite .",
    "since the density probably increases with decreasing radius , the density ( and therefore average field strength ) of the material sampled by oh in the @xmath68 states should be higher than that of the lower states .",
    "there is no evidence that the magnetic field strengths derived from zeeman splitting in @xmath68 masers @xcite are weaker than those derived from masers in the @xmath73 @xcite or @xmath74 transitions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . indeed ,",
    "if w3(oh ) is not atypical , there is reason to believe that field strengths deduced from oh zeeman splitting actually increase as measured by higher excitation states in the @xmath41 ladder @xcite .",
    "the fourth explanation differs from the third in that it suggests that masers may inherently occur at density enhancements in the surrounding medium .",
    "this is plausible given the conditions of formation of interstellar oh masers .",
    "observed maser strengths require some combination of oh enrichment and density enhancement @xcite .",
    "oh masers are believed to form in the zone between the ionization and shock fronts @xcite , where instabilities lead to inhomogeneous density enhancement ( e.g. , simulations of * ? ? ?",
    "the density conditions under which oh masers form have implications which affect the physical interpretation of their phenomenology .",
    "if masers are formed preferentially at density enhancements , magnetic field measurements obtained at oh maser sites should be higher than the average magnetic field strength in the surrounding region .",
    "it would also be strong evidence that observed proper motions of oh masers ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are due to discrete material motions , not shifting coherence paths that could be unrepresentative of the motion of the material .",
    "it is difficult to tell conclusively whether or not the material sampled by @xmath68 absorption is at a lower density than the @xmath41 masers in most of our sources . in k3@xmath450 ,",
    "the upper limit on the magnetic field strength in the absorption falls within the range obtained from masers . in g10.624@xmath40.385 ,",
    "the inclination of the magnetic field to the line of sight alone is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between our upper limit and maser field strength values .",
    "but it is quite possible that a field direction reversal occurs across the source , which would reduce the effective average line - of - sight strength detectable through absorption .",
    "it is also not possible to rule out that there exists a field direction reversal _ along the line of sight_. however , magnetic field directions deduced from oh maser zeeman splitting in massive star - forming regions show an overwhelming tendency to fall into one of two categories : ( 1 ) a constant line - of - sight direction throughout the source , and ( 2 ) a single reversal across the source with the property that a line can be drawn dividing the source into a region of positive magnetic field and a region of negative magnetic field @xcite . a reversal of the field direction _ along the line of sight _ would produce projected regions of mixed magnetic field direction , suggesting that they are not common in massive star - forming regions .    as for w3(oh ) , the magnetic field measurement obtained from absorption @xmath87  mg is less than those obtained from masers projected atop the  region in the @xmath88 transitions ( average @xmath89 standard error of the mean : @xmath90  mg , from * ? ? ?",

    "most masers in w3(oh ) have no detectable linear polarization @xcite , suggesting that the magnetic field in w3(oh ) is oriented close to the line of sight ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) and therefore that the average magnetic field sampled by @xmath68 absorption is less than that sampled by maser emission .",

    "the magnetic field strength measured from @xmath68 absorption is significantly less than the value obtained from @xmath68 masers . taken together , these results suggest that @xmath68 masers occur only in the highest - density portions of the oh cloud , even though oh likely exists in the @xmath68 excited state throughout the source",

    "the grand question is whether the small line - of - sight magnetic field strength measured in @xmath0  absorption necessarily implies density enhancement at maser sites . if @xmath68 absorption occurs only where the @xmath68 masers occur , then the full magnetic field strength ( as deduced from the @xmath68 masers ) in this region ranges from 5.6 to 11.3  mg @xcite , consistent with the range of field strengths determined from @xmath74 masers at this site at the northern limb of the  region @xcite .",
    "restricting consideration to the @xmath1 transition , the transition in which a positive result for zeeman splitting is obtained in absorption , favors the upper end of this range of field strengths , since the only detected maser zeeman pair implies a full magnetic field strength of 10.3  mg ( table [ maser - table ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field in this region does not appear to be significantly inclined to the line of sight @xcite , suggesting that the line - of - sight magnetic field strength is comparable to the full magnetic field strength .",
    "since the average magnetic field strength derived from masers in this region is 9.1 mg , three times the field strength measured in absorption , it might be concluded that masers are denser than the surrounding , non - masing region by a factor of 9 , under the reasonable assumption that @xmath128 .",

    "@xcite identify three other regions of @xmath35  masers projected atop the  region in w3(oh ) : a central clump with magnetic fields of 6.2 and 7.1  mg , a southern clump with fields of 2.3 to 6.0  mg , and a western clump with a magnetic field of 1.8  mg . observations of the @xmath129 transitions , with an excitation temperature of 511  k above ground , show strong absorption at the northern clump as well as weaker absorption at the central and southern clumps @xcite . in the @xmath130 ( 270  k above ground ) transitions ,",
    "significant absorption is seen at and between all four @xmath35maser clumps , while in the @xmath131 ( 415  k above ground ) transitions , absorption is seen mainly along a line running through the northern , central , and southern clumps , with weaker absorption from the western clump @xcite .",
    "there is no published map of @xmath0  ( 290  k above ground ) absorption in w3(oh ) , but the distribution of oh in other comparable excited states suggests that strong @xmath0  absorption would be seen over the majority of the western half of the  region , including the sites of all four @xmath35  maser clumps .",
    "this would imply that the density at @xmath35  maser sites is about 2 to 4 times that of the non - masing oh . on the other hand , 7820 mhz ( @xmath132 ) and 8190 mhz ( @xmath133 ) _ emission _ is seen exclusively near the northern maser clump @xcite , and 6031 mhz ( @xmath36 , @xmath134 ) and 6035 mhz ( @xmath135 ) _ maser emission _ is strongest near the northern maser clump @xcite . in total , this suggests that while @xmath0  absorption occurs over most of the western half of w3(oh ) , the strongest contribution to the absorption most likely comes from the northern clump , which has the highest average magnetic field strength .",
    "the unweighted average magnetic field determined from oh masers in all transitions atop the  region is 6.9  mg .",
    "due to the distribution of maser spots , this effectively gives highest weight to the northern clump and lowest weight to the eastern clump , consistent with our arguments based on the distribution of excited - state @xmath136 and @xmath41 oh absorption and emission .",
    "thus , the density at maser sites is likely several ( @xmath137 ) times that of the non - masing regions in w3(oh ) .",
