    "it is widely known that the first - generation laser interferometric gw detectors suffer from the great amount of noises of various nature .",
    "the major limiting factors at low and middle frequencies are seismic noise and thermal noise which can be referred to the class of displacement noise of the test masses . at high frequencies photon",
    "shot noise is dominant . in the standard quantum",
    "limited ( sql ) @xcite second - generation detectors , being under preparation , the cause of sql is the fluctuating force of radiation pressure in the laser beam ( back - action noise ) pushing the interferometer mirrors in a random manner . thus standard quantum limitation",
    "also aries due to displacement noise .",
    "each method of suppressing or eliminating of displacement noise proposed up - to - date is only suited for control of only one kind of noise .",
    "for instance , active antiseismic isolation will definitely suppress seismic noise but is helpless against thermal noise or quantum radiation pressure . from the other hand , quantum - non - demolition ( qnd ) schemes of measurements @xcite are able canceling back - action noise but are certainly not suited for dealing with seismic or thermal noise .",
    "however , recently there has been proposed a revolutionary new method of displacement noise cancelation which simultaneously eliminates the information about all external fluctuating forces but leaves certain amount of information about the gravitational waves .",
    "the major idea is to construct such an interferometer that would respond differently to the motion of the test masses and the gws",
    ". then the proper linear combination of the interferometer responses will cancel the fluctuations of the test masses leaving a non - vanishing information about the gws .",
    "one may find at least two different methods proposed up - to - date .    the first one , described in a series of papers by s. kawamura _ et al .",
    "@xcite , bears on the distributed nature of the gws",
    ". this can be best explained from the viewpoint of a local observer ( or the local lorentz gauge ) .",
    "in such a reference frame interaction of the gw with a laser interferometer adds up to two effects @xcite .",
    "the first one is the motion of the test masses in the gw tidal force - field . in this aspect gws",
    "are indistinguishable from any non - gw forces since both are sensed by the light wave only at the moments of reflection from the test masses",
    ". we will refer to this as the _ localized _ nature of the forces acting on the test masses .",
    "if the linear scale @xmath2 of a gw detector is much smaller than the gravitational wavelength @xmath3 ( the so - called long - wave approximation ) then the effect of the gw force - field is of the order of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the absolute value of the gw amplitude .",
    "relative motion of the test masses , separated by a distance @xmath2 , in any force field can not be sensed by one of them faster than @xmath6 , thus resulting in the rise of terms of the order of @xmath7 $ ] describing time delays which take the light wave to travel between the masses .",
    "second , gw directly couples to the light wave effectively changing the coordinate velocity of light , thus manifesting itself as an effective refraction index .",
    "light wave traveling in such a ( boundless ) medium acquires the information about the gw in its phase gradually , therefore it is a _ distributed _ effect having the @xmath8 $ ] order in long - wave approximation .",
    "ultimately , from the viewpoint of local observer displacement - noise - free interferometry implies the cancelation of localized effects ( gw and non - gw forces ) leaving a non - vanishing information about the distributed effect ( the direct coupling of the gw to light ) .",
    "it was pointed in refs .",
    "@xcite that in order the gw detector to be a truly displacement - noise - free interferometer it should be also free from optical laser noise since the latter is indistinguishable from laser displacement noise",
    ". their sum is usually called laser phase noise .",
    "cancelation of laser phase noise in interferometric experiments is usually achieved by implementing the differential ( balanced ) schemes of measurements : in conventional interferometers ( such as ligo ) it is the michelson topology and in dfis proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is the mach - zehnder ( mz ) topology .",
    "although dfi detectors that bear on distributed nature of gws allow complete elimination of displacement noise , the `` payment '' for such a gain is the significant weakening of the gw response at low frequencies .",
    "this fact directly follows from the mechanism of noise cancelation : together with displacement noise we also cancel gw terms of the @xmath4 and @xmath9 orders , leaving only the @xmath8$]-order terms .",
    "in addition , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , only 3d ( space - based ) configurations of dfis allow the 2nd - order response , while the response of 2d ( ground - based ) detectors @xcite is even weaker  it is proportional to @xmath10 . for the ground - based detectors with @xmath11 m and @xmath12 m such a dramatic decrease of susceptibility to gws ( @xmath13 ) levels all the advantages of dfi in comparison with traditional detectors dominated by displacement noise .    the second type of dfi detectors proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , is free from this drawback since the mechanism of noise cancelation does not utilize the notion of gw distributed nature . the basic element of the proposed toy model is a single fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity pumped through both its mirrors with orthogonally polarized light waves .",
    "consider first the pump through one of the mirrors .",
    "two responses will correspond to the input wave  the reflected wave and the transmitted one .",
    "the latter is proportional to the distance between the mirrors which may vary in time under the influence of displacement noise and the gw . the reflected wave ,",
    "however , is somewhat different : besides the term proportional to the variable length of the cavity it also includes the component due to the prompt reflection of the incident wave from the input mirror . thus , reflected and transmitted waves carry slightly different information about the gw and the motion of the test masses . combining them properly one is able to exclude displacement noise of one of the cavity mirrors . in a similar way one can deal with the second pump through another mirror .",
    "ultimately , the proper linear combination of all four responses allows elimination of displacement noise of both mirrors leaving a non - vanishing gw signal proportional to @xmath4 in long - wave approximation .",
    "unfortunately , since the mechanism of noise cancelation bears on the effect of prompt reflection which is nonresonant , the obtained dfi response is not amplified with the usual resonant factor associated with the accumulation of low - frequency signal inside the cavity .    it may seem that the elimination of mirrors displacement noise at the @xmath4-order contradicts the force - like behavior of the gws at low frequencies .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the loss of the resonant gain results in the sensitivity limitation by displacement noises of auxiliary optical elements such as lasers and detectors . in conventional non - dfi detectors",
    "these noises are negligible since they are finesse times smaller as compared to displacement noise of the mirrors . in a double - pumped fp cavity",
    "these residual fluctuations mean that the gw - induced displacements can not be measured absolutely but only with respect to some reference test masses , in full agreement with the relativity principle .",
    "the fluctuations of these reference masses will ultimately limit the accuracy of coordinate measurements .",
    "therefore , in a double - pumped fp cavity dfi response is not strictly speaking displacement - noise - free : we are able to cancel noise of the mirrors ( the major `` headache '' in conventional detectors ) but not the one of auxiliary optics ( lasers , detectors , beamsplitters , etc ) .",
    "another drawback of the double - pumped fp dfi is the inability to cancel laser noise since the single - cavity - scheme is not balanced .",
    "although one may propose several fp - based balanced optical setups , for instance , modifications of conventional michelson / fabry - perot topology , in all such schemes dfi response will be still limited by residual displacement noise of some test mass(es ) .",
    "this is a fundamental restriction of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in spite of the undoubtful theoretical `` beauty '' of dfi idea proposed by s. kawamura _ et al .",
    "_ , such a detector , if realized in a full - scale experiment , will surely face certain technical difficulties as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite . for instance",
    ", it is hardly possible to have ideal 50/50 beamsplitters or lossless mirrors .",
    "ultimately , one may expect @xmath14-fold reduction of displacement noise .",
    "in other words , although completely displacement - noise - free in theory , dfis of the 1st type will suffer from various technical limitations in practice that will eventually leave a certain level of residual displacement noise . from this viewpoint",
    "the theoretical ( fundamental ) limitations of the 2nd type ( incomplete ) dfi schemes may not seem so dramatic as one could expect . eventually , in both cases an experimentalist would have to deal with certain technical challenges and the only thing that matters is the total level of noise left , regardless its nature . and though suppression of residual displacement noise in dfis of the 2nd type may turn a more complex problem than that in dfis of the 1st type ,",
    "the former still have a significant advantage  strong gw response at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider such gw detectors that would have as simple topologies as possible simultaneously allowing as complete displacement noise cancelation as possible and having the strongest response to gws that general relativity allows .",
    "the latter requirement can be derived straightforwardly . according to relativity principle absolute coordinate and velocity measurements",
    "are prohibited .",
    "this is another formulation of indistinguishability between the gw and non - gw forces at the 0th and 1st orders of @xmath15 .",
    "the difference rises only in the @xmath8 $ ] order at low frequencies , as described above .",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath17 then such a displacement - noise - free gw response will be proportional to @xmath18 in spectral domain .",
    "in addition , this response can be further amplified with a fp cavity , for instance",
    ". then one should expect the rise of the @xmath19 resonant multiplier , where @xmath1 is the cavity half - bandwidth .",
    "ultimately , the strongest dfi gw response allowed by the first principles should be proportional to @xmath20 in spectral domain .",
    "the optical setup satisfying the requirements of practical reasonableness and maximum completeness of displacement noise elimination , also restricted by condition of the strongest response derived above , does not , however , immediately follows from some basic principles .",
    "it is a matter of search at large , limited by practically reasonable configurations and assumptions .",
    "for instance , in this paper introducing several model assumptions we propose a pair of symmetrically positioned michelson interferometers with fabry - perot cavities inserted into each arm of both interferometers , as a dfi gw detector with a reasonably simple optical setup and the strongest possible response .",
    "first , consider a conventional ligo topology ( without power- and signal - recycling mirrors ) .",
    "let the end mirrors be partially transmittible .",
    "in this case an interferometer will produce three response signals : the reflected ( laser - noise - free ) one in conventional dark park and the transmitted ones in the arms .",
    "it is worth noting here that certain care is required when calculating the responses : each response signal should be evaluated in the proper reference frame of the detector that detects the corresponding signal @xcite .",
    "otherwise , unmeasurable quantities may arise in the analysis .",
    "an experimentalist is able to measure the quadrature components of the interferometer responses and record them for further processing . from the set of transmitted signals",
    "quadratures it is possible , in principle , to construct a laser - noise - free linear combination .",
    "therefore , at this stage we may obtain two signals ( quadratures ) free from laser phase noise : the reflected one and the combined transmitted one .",
    "due to the sophisticated frequency dependence of the fp cavities responses these two signals can be combined in turn to eliminate one of four differential mechanical degrees of freedoms associated with the test masses ( beamsplitter , two input mirrors , two end mirrors and two end detectors ) .",
    "at this stage we introduce some restrictions into the optical scheme : ( i ) end detectors and end mirrors , and ( ii ) input mirrors and beamsplitter are assumed to be rigidly connected .",
    "the practical legitimacy of these assumptions seems questionable and is open for criticism , although , no basic principles forbid such a gedanken ( thought ) experiment . under these restrictions",
    "we are left with only two differential degrees of freedom , one of which can be eliminated in a combination of two laser - noise - free signals .",
    "we choose to cancel displacement noise associated with the differential motion of the end platforms .    ultimately , due to the symmetry of plane gw wavefront we are able to cancel the fluctuations of the central platform ( with beamsplitter and input mirrors ) if the similar interferometer is positioned symmetrically ( see fig .",
    "[ pic_double_michelson_fp ] in the text ) and both interferometers have common central platform ( this is another gedanken - experiment - supposion ) . in this case",
    "the single - interferometer partial dfi responses will have gw term of the same sign but the fluctuations of the central platform will enter with different signs .",
    "adding two single - interferometer responses we cancel displacement noise of the latter . then the obtained laser- and displacement - noise - free gw response signal turns out to be proportional to @xmath21 amplified with the cavity resonant gain @xmath22 .",
    "let us first remind briefly the `` tools '' necessary for our further considerations .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , to obtain physically reasonable , i.e. measurable , quantities , calculations should be performed in the proper reference frames of the devices that produce the corresponding experimentally observed quantities .",
    "since they are usually subjected to external fluctuative forces , they commit random motions and thus we have to deal with their proper non - inertial reference frames . corresponding tools for solving certain boundary electrodynamical problems in such reference frames have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and utilized in ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore , in this paper we will not retell the content of these works in detail but will write several useful formulas in this section .",
    "in particular , the space - time of an observer having non - geodesic acceleration @xmath23 along the @xmath24-axis and falling in the weak , plane , +-polarized gw @xmath25 propagating along the @xmath26-axis takes the following form : @xmath27 +      dx^2+dy^2+dz^2\\nonumber\\\\      & + \\,\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{x^2-y^2}{c^2}\\,\\ddot{h}(t - z / c)\\ ,      ( c\\,dt - dz)^2 .",
