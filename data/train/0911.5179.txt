    "the fragmentation happens continuously in the sense that there is no first splitting event , and in fact along a branch of the fragmentation tree the branching points are dense on any intervals .",
    "the construction of such processes , known as homogeneous fragmentation processes , requires some care and was essentially carried out by bertoin ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we defer a brief overview of the general construction to the next section .",

    "the process @xmath106 is called a mass fragmentation .",
    "one can define directly mass fragmentations ( i.e. markov processes with state space @xmath4 such that each fragments split independently with the same rate ) but all such processes can be seen as the frequency process of an underlying integer partition fragmentation    given the `` stationary and independent increments '' flavor of the definition of a fragmentation , it is no surprise that there is a lvy - kintchin type description of the law of these processes .",
    "bertoin shows that the distribution of a homogeneous fragmentation @xmath46 is completely characterised by a sigma - finite measure @xmath3 on @xmath4 ( _ the disclocation measure _ ) which satisfies @xmath107 and a parameter @xmath108 ( _ the erosion rate _ ) .",
    "the meaning of the dislocation measure @xmath3 is best understood through a poissonian construction of the process @xmath46 which is given in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , for each @xmath109 we have an independent poisson point process on @xmath110 with intensity @xmath111 if @xmath112 is an atom of the point process with label @xmath102 , then at time @xmath113 the block @xmath114 of @xmath115 is split into fragments of relative size given by @xmath116 ( or more precisely it is split according to kingman s paintbox partition directed by @xmath117 ) . to make the construction rigorous , one needs to show that the point processes can be used to construct a compatible family of markov chains , @xmath118 , each of which lives on @xmath119 , the space of partitions of @xmath120 .",
    "hence @xmath22 is the rate at which blocks fragment into subfragments of relative size @xmath121    the role of the erosion term @xmath122 is easier to explain in terms of mass fragmentations .",
    "indeed the process @xmath123 for @xmath124 is a @xmath125-mass fragmentation . as the erosion is essentially a deterministic phenomenon ,",
    "unless otherwise specified we will always suppose @xmath126 the dislocation measure @xmath3 thus plays the same role as in our introductory example where @xmath3 was finite .",
    "recall the definition @xmath127 and that the function @xmath28 is the laplace exponent of a pure jump subordinator associated to the fragmentation .",
    "this subordinator is precisely the process @xmath128 it is also not difficult to show that the associated lvy measure is given by @xmath129      our main theorem is in the spirit of earlier results which concern branching brownian motion or branching random walks .",
    "we discuss these here and we explain why equation ( [ e : integ dif equ - first - view ] ) is the analogue of the fkpp traveling wave equation for fragmentations .",
    "the classical fkpp equation , in its simplest form , takes the form of the non - linear parabolic differential equation @xmath130    the fkpp equation is one of the simplest partial differential equation which admits a traveling wave solution of the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 $ ] and @xmath133 is the speed of the traveling wave .",

    "@xcite ) . however , mckean @xcite , ikeda et al .",
    "@xcite , neveu @xcite and chauvin @xcite all show that the fkpp equation has a natural relationship with one - dimensional dyadic branching brownian motion ( bbm ) .",
    "the latter process consists of an individual particle positioned at @xmath136 which executes a brownian motion until a unit - mean , independent and exponentially distributed time at which point it divides into two particles .",
    "each of these particles behaves independently of one another and their parent and undergo the same life - cycle as the initial ancestor but space - time shifted to their point of creation .",
    "the process thus propagates via the obvious iteration of this procedure .",

    "a natural extension of this model is to replace the bbm by a continuous - time branching random walk ( brw ) .",
    "this process can be described as follows .",
    "a particle positioned at @xmath141 lives for an unit mean , exponentially distributed length of time and upon dying it scatters a random number of offsprings in space relative to its own position according to the point process whose atoms are @xmath142 .",
    "each of this particle then iterates this same procedure , independently from each other and from the past , starting from their new positions . as above , let @xmath137 denote the positions of the particles at time @xmath42 .",

    ".    given that homogeneous fragmentations can be seen as generalized branching random walks , it is natural to formulate analogous results in this wider setting .",
    "to derive the analogue of ( [ e : classical ] ) , let us consider the following intuitive reasoning where for simplicity we assume that @xmath3 is a finite dislocation measure .",
    "the classical technique for solving ( [ e : classical ] ) with initial condition @xmath145 consists of showing that @xmath146 is a solution .",
    "we take the same approach for fragmentations , where the role of the position @xmath147 is played by @xmath148 .",
    "it is easily seen from the fragmentation property that @xmath149 recall also from the definition of a fragmentation process that in each infinitesimal period of time @xmath150 , each block independently experiences a dislocation , fragmenting smaller blocks of relative size @xmath151 with probability @xmath152 and more than one split dislocation occurs with probability @xmath153 . roughly speaking",
    ", it follows that as @xmath154 @xmath155 this suggestively leads us to the integro - differential equation @xmath156 with initial condition @xmath145 , which we now formally identify as the analogue to the fkpp equation , even for the case that @xmath3 is an infinite measure .",

    "note that the additive martingale is positive and therefore converges almost surely .",
    "the derivative martingale , so called because it is constructed from the derivative in @xmath163 of the additive martingale , is a signed martingale and it is not a priori clear that it converges almost surely .",
    "moreover , when limits for either of thee two martingales exist , it is also not clear if they are non - trivial .",

    "let us briefly discuss in informal terms the proof of this theorem . for convenience we shall define the integro - differential operator @xmath176",
    "moreover we shall say that @xmath177 is a _ multiplicative martingale function _ if ( [ e : prod mart ] ) is a martingale .",
    "the equivalence of the analytical property @xmath178 and the probabilistic property of @xmath62 being a multiplicative martingale function emerges from a classical feynman - kac representation as soon as one can apply the appropriate stochastic calculus ( which in the current setting is necessarily driven by the underlying poisson random measure used to defined the fragmentation process ) in order to give the semi - martingale representation of @xmath69 .    to show the unique form of solutions in @xmath179 , we start by studying the asymptotics of multiplicative martingale functions .",
    "we shall elaborate slightly here for the case @xmath180 . to this end , consider @xmath181 a multiplicative martingale function which makes ( [ e : prod mart ] ) a martingale .",

    "taking logs of the multiplicative martingale we see that @xmath184 recall that @xmath185 hence , if we replace @xmath186 by @xmath187 ( assuming that the argument of the log is asymptotically close to 1 ) and multiply by @xmath188 we see that @xmath189 as @xmath190 . we know however that the @xmath191 is the additive martingale and converges to @xmath192 on the other hand , for each fixed @xmath193 we know that @xmath194 is bertoin s tagged fragment subordinator minus some drift so it is a lvy process with no positive jumps .",
    "accordingly it respects the law of large numbers @xmath195 as @xmath190 for some constant @xmath196 which can be shown to be positive .",

    "a direct consequence of this is that , irrespective of the multiplicative martingale function @xmath62 that we started with , the @xmath71 limit @xmath72 is always equal ( up to an additive constant in @xmath141 ) to @xmath203 .",
    "the stated uniqueness of @xmath62 follows immediately .",
    "clearly this argument can not work in the case @xmath175 on account of the fact that theorem [ t : mgcgce ] tells us that @xmath204 almost surely .",
    "none the less , a similar , but more complex argument in which a comparison of the @xmath71 martingale limit @xmath205 is made with the derivative martingale limit @xmath206 is possible .",
    "one particular technical difficulty in the above argument is that one needs to uniformly control the terms @xmath207 in order to  factor out \" the common approximation @xmath208 .",
    "one could try to control the position of the left - most particle to do this ( as in @xcite ) , however , this turns out to be inconvenient and another technique -taking the martingales along the so - called stopping - lines- appears to work better .",
    "this is a classical idea in the context of bbm ( see for example neveu @xcite and kyprianou @xcite ) and brw ( see for example biggins and kyprianou @xcite ) .    thanks to their uniform integrability , the martingales @xmath209 and @xmath210 may be seen as the projection of their limits on to @xmath211 , the information generated by the fragmentation tree when it is  cut \" at fixed time @xmath42 . however , we could also project these limits back on to filtrations generated by the fragmentation tree up to different  increasing \" sequences of  cuts \" or _ stopping lines _ as they turn out to be known as . to give an example ,",
    "a particular instance of a  increasing sequence \" of stopping line is studied by bertoin and martinez @xcite who _ freeze _ fragments as soon as their size is smaller than a certain threshold @xmath212 . after some time",
    "all fragments are smaller than this threshold and the process stops thereby  cutting \" through the fragmentation tree .",
    "the collection of fragments @xmath213 one gets in the end generates another filtration @xmath214 .",
    "projecting the martingale limits @xmath72 and @xmath215 back on to this filtration produces two new uniformly integrable martingales which have the same limits as before and which look the same as @xmath216 and @xmath217 , respectively , except that the role of @xmath218 is now played by @xmath219 . considering the case @xmath220 , so that @xmath221 , one could now rework the heuristic argument given in the previous paragraphs for this sequence of stopping lines and take advantage of the uniform control that one now has over the fragment sizes on @xmath213 . a modification of this line of reasoning with a different choice of stopping line when @xmath222 can and will be used as a key feature in the proof of our main theorem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",

    "more precisely we generalize the notion of _ frozen fragmentation _ defined in @xcite to other stopping lines which allow us to study the whole range of wave speeds . one particular feature which will emerge in this section will be the fact that , for certain parameter ranges , the stopping lines we consider will sweep out a crump - mode - jagers ( cmj ) process embedded within the fragmentation process .    a central result of the proof is given in section [ s : lln ] where we provide a law of large numbers for the empirical distribution of the sizes of the blocks on the stopping lines defined in the previous section .",
