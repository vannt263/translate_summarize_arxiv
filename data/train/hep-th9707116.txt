    "the idea of using knots for descrbing elementary fields is not new . it was proposed in 1867 by lord kelvin @xcite for atoms . for about 20 years",
    "his theory was taken seriously .",
    "it eventually failed , but provided inspiration for the first extensive mathematical studies on knots , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , it was found that knot structures form stable solutions in a model proposed in @xcite .",
    "this model describes the 3 + 1 dynamics of a three - component vector of unit length .",
    "such a vector field is a typical degree of freedom in the non - linear @xmath4-model , a prototype relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the mathematical theory of knots @xcite deals with knots constructed out of a `` closed loop of rope '' . the trefoil knot ( fig .",
    "1 ) is the simplest example of such torus - knots . in this letter ,",
    "we will attempt to classify , in an ad - hoc manner , knot - like stuctures obtained from the trefoil knot by placing it into different positions of 3 + 1   dimensional space - time .",
    "we will discuss related open knots as well , which can be obtained from a trefoil knot by the single cut ( or by extending one of its loops to infinity ) .",
    "as no attempt will be made to define any underlying theory , which could lead for example to solutions numbered by knots , our presentation will demonstrate a substantial degree of ambiguity and arbitrarines .",
    "let us start with a glance at the lattice - like structure in 3 + 1   dimensional space",
    ". from every junction there can be links directed into four direction : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "every link can `` vibrate '' along three directions perpendicular to itself .",
    "this leads to @xmath9 independent degrees of freedom .",
    "it is obvious that rotations belonging to the lorentz group in a natural way provide a transformation relating vibrational degrees of freedom of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 links but _ not @xmath8_. this leads to the possible different classification of vibrational degrees of freedom for such links , namely @xmath10 .",
    "now , let us realize that a simultaneous move of the endpoints of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 links along the @xmath8 direction is equivalent to an opposite shift of the central junction under consideration along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "this leads to a possible separation of our degrees of freedom accordingly to the following pattern : @xmath11 .",
    "it should be noted , that the separation @xmath12 is much less founded than the previous one .",
    "of course any attempt to draw a parallel between such classifications of vibrational degrees of freedom and the degrees of freedom of bosonic fields in the standard model of elementary particles must find healthy critic as arbitrary - link is not connected by lorentz space - time transformations with space - like links and we put them into separate groups , do we consider vibrational modes of space links in the @xmath8-direction and space - like directions as belonging to the same group ?",
    "a possible explanation is that vibration is on a smaller scale , where only topological properties such as continuity or closeness count . ] .",
    "now , let us move to the trefoil knot .",
    "it is an object of 3 dimensions .",
    "we can think of it as of a basically flat 2-dimensional object , as represented in our figures .",
    "there are 3 and just 3 such orthogonal planes : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or , what is equivalent , as a 3-dimensional object from any of three 3-dimensional sub - spaces : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 including the time direction . ] . as a consequence",
    "all objects of our further classification will automatically appear in 3 identical copies .",
    "we will continue now with a presentation of objects from just one of these classes .    to obtain the objects we will cut the trefoil knot ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) and extend the loose ends into any direction of space time , irrespective of the original orientation of the knot plane .",
    "the objects will group naturally , depending on the lorentz - separated zones the loose ends happen to point at .    as the first choice",
    "we take both loose ends pointing into the time - direction .",
    "we end up with @xmath21 possibilities corresponding to links pointing into the future or the past and two possibilities of left- or right - handed knot ( see fig 2 ) .",
    "such objects have loose ends that can be source of vibrations of the @xmath22 modes and the knot as a whole can vibrate with @xmath23 mode .",
    "well , this looks very much like colour - singlet weak doublets of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if we take one loose end pointing into one of the three possible space directions , another one into the time - direction of future or past , together with a choice of left- or right - handed knot , we have in total @xmath26 possibilities ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . such objects , owing to their free links , can be sources of vibrations of any of the @xmath27 modes .",
    "well , it looks very much like @xmath28 3-colour weak doublets of left - handed quarks and right - handed antiquarks .",
    "if we take both loose ends pointing into the space - direction ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) we end up with @xmath29 possibilities possibilities .",
    "] . such objects , owing to their free links , can be sources of vibrations of the @xmath30 modes .",
    "well , it looks very much like two separate classes for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. 3-colour weak singlets of right - handed up / down - quark and left - handed up / down - antiquark .",
    "there are also two non - cut trefoil knots : left and right ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as they span no external links at all , they can be coupled to vibrational degree of freedom of type @xmath23 only .",
    "that is why we can note them as objects of the type @xmath33 .",
    "these two objects we will associate , again in a somewhat arbitrary way , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    at this point",
    "we are left with the complete list of the standard model degrees of freedom , except for the , as yet not discovered experimentally , higgs field . on the other hand ,",
    "we still have @xmath36 possibilities of a knot structure when one of the loose ends points into the future and another one into the past ( see fig .",
    "should the cut - knot of fig .",
    "6 be considered as just a kind of linear combinations of the basic states from @xmath21 class",
    "? we may also guess that these cut - knots are related to degrees of freedoms of ` new physics ' , e.g. the higgs field .",
    "please note , however that we have in total @xmath37 , thus 6 such knots , corresponding respectively to left and right knot of three ` families ' . on the other hand",
    ", we need only 4 degrees of freedom for the higgs field in the standard model .",
    "let us now sketch another construction , but basically equivalent to the previous one , where the function of loose ends and a knot loop simply get interchanged .",
    "let us go back to our 3 + 1   dimensional lattice .",
    "if we assume that it is built out of infinite string - like lines , following the three @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 directions , crossing at junctions , then knots ( as in fig .",
    "6 ) can appear as kind of defects .",
    "now we can realize that the knot loop may extend to surround neighbouring string - like lines or junctions in : ( i ) time direction , ( ii ) time and space directions , ( iii ) space direction , ( iv ) two distinct space directions , ( v ) no overlap at all .",
    "it is interesting to realize that in this way we end up with a spectrum of knots that coincides with the one presented above in our letter .",
    "it thus again coincides with the spectrum of elementary fermions , which are again grouped into 3 families .",
    "i believe , however , that proliferating such ambiguous constructions does not make much sense without attempting to construct models for possible underlying dynamics , which could lead to predictions confrontable to the data .",
    "so far this construction can not even be disproved .",
    "somehow i can not make my mind up on whether this construction is entertainment or a sketchy hypothesis . in any case",
    ", this construction is simple , counts all observed elementary fields of the standard model and leaves very little room for anything else .",
    "i would like to thank prof .",
    "m. veltman for useful discussions .",
    "i would like especially to thank him for his initial discouraging me to publish this letter .",
    "this helped me to mature the ideas .",
    "i would like to thank him also for asking me , several months later , whether i had published it anyway .",
    "this encouraged me to publish it finally .",
