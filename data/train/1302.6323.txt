    "the thylakoid membrane is differentiated into stacked discs of tightly appressed membrane called grana , tubes or sheets of unappressed membrane called stroma lamellae , and controversial junctional regions called margins @xcite .",
    "psii and lhcii are among the many proteins that display dramatic lateral heterogeneity within this complex membrane architecture  psii and lhcii typically localize to appressed grana membranes , photosystem i ( with its light - harvesting complex i ) and atp synthase are predominantly found in unappressed membranes , and other proteins such as cytochrome @xmath0 are present in both regions @xcite .",
    "the degrees of both supercomplex formation and lateral heterogeneity are dynamically regulated in reponse to environmental factors by the processes of state transitions and psii repair , in which phosphorylation of lhcii or psii ( respectively ) is correlated with partial or complete dissolution of the supercomplex and migration of the phosphorylated protein species toward stroma lamellae or margin regions ; many mechanistic details remain under debate @xcite .    within grana stacks ,",
    "the most striking features of protein organization are regular 2d patterns termed arrays .",
    "since their early description in the 1960s @xcite , these motifs have frequently beeen observed in electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies of stacked thylakoid membranes , and are composed of tens or hundreds of unit cells containing one psii core dimer and variable quantities of lhcii ( reviewed in @xcite ) . array extent and unit cell",

    "hypothesized functional rationales for psii arrays primarily focus on predicted exciton transport effects , such as optimizing antenna size , excitation quenching site availability , or reaction center connectivity to match light conditions @xcite , and on protein and electron carrier mobility arguments @xcite , but no functional role has been proven .",

    "our model consists of two coupled 2d layers , representing stroma - paired grana membranes , which comprise the minimal system for psii array formation @xcite .",
    "these two layers can be thought of as an isolated membrane pair , or as two stroma - paired membranes in a larger grana stack where lumen - side interactions are assumed to be negligible @xcite .",

    "motivated by the apparent equilibrium between moderately bound and free lhciis , we introduce two interaction sites on the periphery of each psii particle , as illustrated by the orange dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b and c and fig .  s1 .",

    "our simple model of lhcii stacking interactions similarly proved sufficient to generate a range of structural motifs that have been inferred from experiment . specifically , we frequently observed ( 1 ) pairs of stacked , nearly parallel psiis , in which the lhciis chirally embedded in one psii are both aligned with the embedded lhciis of the opposing psii ( of opposite chirality ) ( fig .",

    "remarkably , the resulting coexistence region encompasses the grana packing fractions and compositions reported from many in vivo and in vitro experiments ( e.g. , filled and open squares in fig .",

    "the well - understood phenomenology of phase transitions helps explain why the extent of psii array formation varies so dramatically between similar samples in experiment .",
    "the presence , extent , and number of arrays in the laboratory may be influenced by the characteristically slow dynamics associated with phase transitions .",
    "nucleation of one phase from the other will be governed by rare structural fluctuations ; crowding within grana membranes @xcite will likely make the subsequent repartitioning of material between phases slow as well . moreover , grana isolation protocols that increase the protein packing fraction beyond the freezing transition densities for 2d hard discs ( @xmath25 @xcite ) or hard rods ( @xmath44 @xcite ) , such as bby @xcite , could trap the isolated grana in jammed nonequilibrium configurations , further complicating experimental determinations of the equilibrium distribution of psii arrays",

    "proximity to phase coexistence could also contribute to substantial changes in thylakoid function observed to accompany modest changes in protein content and interactions .",
    "in addition to the low - light acclimation scenario discussed above , many regulatory processes associated with non - photochemical quenching , photoprotection , and repair shift the system s position relative to phase boundaries in the @xmath45-plane : ( 1 ) state transitions involve transport of lhcii from psii - rich to psi - rich membranes @xcite , reducing the local protein density and lhcii : psii ratio .

    "the first two attractions ( with energy scales @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) act between an interaction site on psii and an lhcii particle . the interaction is square - well , with a distance cutoff of @xmath54 between the lhcii center and the binding site , or equivalently a distance cutoff between the lhcii edge and the binding site of @xmath55 nm",
    "; this short - range distance cutoff ensures that each binding site can bind at most one lhcii at a time .",
    "this square well completely describes the @xmath53 interaction between psiis and nonembedded lhcii particles .",
    "the attraction between psiis and embedded lhciis , @xmath52 , has an additional constraint : the angle difference between the long axes of the two psii particles hosting the interaction sites must be @xmath56 .",
    "the depth of the square wells are set at @xmath57 @xmath7 , except where noted .",
    "temperature @xmath32 fixed at 1 throughout , such that @xmath7 is our reduced unit of energy .",
    "the other attraction involves two lhcii particles ( free or embedded ) in different layers .",
    "this interaction has an energetic minimum , with a value of @xmath58 , when one disc completely eclipses another as viewed from above the layers .",
    "it vanishes continuously at @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the lateral distance between the centers of two lhcii discs .",
    "this dependence is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]d and its functional form is given in the si methods .",
    "the energy scale is set to @xmath61 @xmath7 , except where noted .",
    "using standard metropolis monte carlo methods , we sampled equilibrium configurational distributions of systems comprising @xmath62 psii particles and a variable number @xmath63 of free lhcii particles . trial moves included translational displacements of a randomly chosen lhcii or psii particle , and rotational displacements of a randomly chosen psii particle .",
    "translational moves were restricted to periodically replicated 2d surfaces , each with area @xmath64 per layer . @xmath46- and",
    "@xmath47-components of translational moves were chosen from gaussian distributions with zero mean and variances of 0.6 nm@xmath65 for free lhcii displacements or 0.2 nm@xmath65 for psii displacements .",
    "psii rotations were chosen uniformly on the interval @xmath66 .",
    "an `` mc sweep '' consisted on average of @xmath63 lhcii displacements , @xmath67 psii displacements , and @xmath67 psii rotations .",
    "we performed simulations of closed systems ( i.e. , sampling the canonical ensemble ) with several values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as given in table s1 .",
    "for each set of structural parameters , at least 7 simulations were initialized from independent fluid or partially crystalline configurations .    to scrutinize phase behavior , we performed simulations in which @xmath64 and @xmath63 were allowed to fluctuate ( i.e. , sampling an osmotic ensemble @xcite ) .",
    "these fluctuations were regulated by specified values of pressure @xmath26 and chemical potential @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "in addition to particle displacement trial moves , osmotic ensemble simulations included trial moves that change @xmath64 ( box area moves ) and trial moves that change @xmath63 ( lhcii insertion and deletion moves ) .",
    "acceptance probabilities for the latter moves were constructed to satisfy detailed balance , with the area per layer @xmath64 scaled by the number of layers @xmath68 where necessary .",
    "we determined free energy profiles @xmath31 by exploiting the fundamental relationship @xmath69 to the probability distribution @xmath70 for spontaneous packing fraction fluctuations .",
    "statistics of @xmath13 were in turn determined by maximum likelihood estimation from a set of 139 osmotic ensemble simulations ( @xmath71 @xmath7 relative to a standard state ; @xmath72 @xmath73 ) with imposed harmonic bias potentials of the form @xmath74 .",
    "values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 were chosen to focus sampling on a series of small intervals spanning the range @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "s5 ) . using the mbar method as implemented in the pymbar package @xcite ,",
    "these umbrella sampling results were pooled and reweighted to estimate @xmath79 at many pressures and chemical potentials .",
    "see si methods for details .",
    "psii arrays were identified using a recursive clustering algorithm with three neighbor criteria , all of which must be satisfied for a psii particle to be added to a growing array : ( i ) the angle difference between particle axes must be @xmath80 ; ( ii ) the component of the center - to - center separation vector parallel to a particle axis must be @xmath81 nm ; ( iii ) the component of the center - to - center separation vector perpendicular to a particle axis must be @xmath82 nm .",
