    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are massive , highly - evolved stars nearing the end of their lives as supernovae ( sn ) or as collapsing objects emitting gamma - ray bursts ( grb , e.g. macfadyen & woosley 1999 , postnov & cherepashchuk 2001 , georgy et al .",
    "wr stars undergo rapid mass loss through strong winds , with initial masses of @xmath025m@xmath1 ( crowther 2007 ) .",
    "the classification of wr stars is determined spectroscopically in the optical and is divided among the nitrogen - rich wns , carbon - rich wcs , and oxygen - rich wos . for the most part , single wr stars are thought to follow the evolutionary path : o @xmath2 ( lbv / rsg ) @xmath2 wn @xmath2 wc @xmath2 wo @xmath2 sn [ or grb ] ( conti et al . 1983 , crowther 2007 ) .",

    "sanduleak ( 1971 ) noticed a class of stars that did not have planetary nebulae ( pn ) but displayed a wr - like spectrum with strong o vi doublet emission similar to those found in the central stars of pn named the o vi sequence by smith and aller ( 1969 ) .",
    "these stars were suggested to be a separate wo sequence of wolf - rayet stars ( rather than an extension of the wc sequence ) by barlow & hummer ( 1982 ) .",
    "wo stars are thought to be in the late helium - burning stage , or possibly the carbon - burning stage , where the enhanced oxygen abundance compared to less evolved wr stars is revealed by mass loss stripping ( barlow & hummer 1982 ) . of the 298 galactic wr stars in the appended viith catalogue of galactic wolf - rayet stars ( van der hucht 2001 , 2006 ) , only four are of the rare wo spectral type , including the star wr 142 , also known as sand 5 ( sanduleak 1971 ) and st 3 ( stephenson 1966 ) .",

    "although wr stars have much stronger winds and are more evolved chemically , the line - driven instabilities that are thought to give rise to soft x - rays ( kt @xmath3 1 kev ) from shocks in o star winds may also be present in wr winds ( gayley & owocki 1995 ) .",

    "( 2009 ) . assuming that no variability occurred in the wr 142 source spectrum or n@xmath25 between the two observations , the most likely explanation for this difference would be the much lower effective area of _ chandra _ acis - i at low energies e @xmath24 1 kev .",
    "we tried to fit the spectrum of wr 142 ( figure 3 ) with several different models : a 1 t ( one temperature ) apec optically thin plasma model and a power - law model .",
    "the apec model requires a very high temperature and thus a thermal bremsstrahlung model is similar . because of low counts , the spectral fit results were somewhat sensitive to binning strategy .",
    "representative spectral fits are shown in table 3 , based on fits of unbinned spectra . between the different models ,",
    "there is little variation in the quality of fit using c - statistics ( cash 1979 ) .",
    "however , determining whether a particular model is statistically acceptable using c - statistics is not as straightforward as with @xmath26 statistics ( heinrich 2003 ) .    allowing the abundances to vary from solar displays no significant improvement to",
    "the apec fits , nor does the use of representative wo abundances ( table 3 ) .",
    "this is largely because we do not detect any emission lines in the spectrum from elements such as o which are highly nonsolar in wo stars .",
    "additionally , all of the o and c lines that lie in the _ chandra _ bandpass are below 1 kev where we do not detect any signal .",
    "the data show a slight preference for a model that includes a gaussian line for an iron line in the @xmath5 6.4 - 6.67 kev energy range ( table 3 ) .",
    "the counts from wr 142 are not sufficient to distinguish between the possible iron lines .",
    "the event energies closest to the possible iron emission , 6.24 , 6.40 , 6.60 , and 6.63 kev , show two events within 0.1 kev of the iron k line complex at 6.67 kev ( fe xxv he - like triplet ) .",
    "if a weak fe line is present , it is likely to be the 6.67 kev iron k line , which has been detected in other wr stars .",
    "we have also experimented with fits of binned spectra using @xmath26 statistics in order to estimate confidence bounds on important fit parameters ( f@xmath9 , n@xmath25 , kt , @xmath27 ) .",
    "given the limited number of counts ( 46 ) , binning at desired levels of @xmath2810 counts per bin for fitting with @xmath26 statistics was not feasible .",
    "we thus consider spectra binned to a minimum of 6 counts per bin .",
    "results indicate that if the plasma is thermal , as the apec models assume , then the temperature kt must be very high , with a lower 90% confidence bound of kt @xmath28 3.6 kev ( table 3 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data do not place a useful upper bound on kt .    in determining the x - ray flux , the unbinned spectral fits display fairly consistent results .",
    "the fit with the lowest c - statistic shown in table 3 gives an observed ( absorbed ) x - ray flux of f@xmath9 @xmath10 1.8 ( 0.8 - 2.5 ) @xmath18 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath6 @xmath30 ( 0.3 - 8 kev , 1@xmath19 confidence intervals ) .",

    "spectral fits of wr 142 with n@xmath25 fixed at the value determined from optical extinction give much larger fit residuals than the fits with larger absorption given in table 3 .",
    "the source shows no obvious large - scale variations nor flares in its x - ray lightcurve ( figure 4 ) . as for short term variability",
    ", ks statistics and the gregory - loredo algorithm give a probability of constant count rate of 0.77 and 0.40 , respectively .",
    "thus , neither test implies variability at high confidence levels ( @xmath2890% ) on timescales of hours during the @xmath31 day _ chandra _ observation .    for purposes of comparing the observed x - ray flux by _ chandra _ and the previously published _",

    "some wc stars that are members of binary systems have been known to display hard x - ray emission ( e.g. @xmath8 vel , wc8@xmath7o7.5 ) but the x - ray emission from wr 142 is much less luminous .",

    "perhaps x - ray emission from a binary decreases as a wr star evolves from wn to wc to wo because of changes within the star or its wind .",

    "wr 142 , if a binary , may not have an o star companion but some other less massive non- degenerate stellar companion .",
    "as discussed in section 5.4.2 , a close companion at the right separation could account for a lower x - ray luminosity using a colliding wind model .",
    "the hard x - ray emission and fast wind from wr 142 may indicate a colliding wind shock that could be explained by an as of yet undetected companion at close separation , such as a b0v star companion at @xmath11 1 au from wr 142 ( section 5.4.2 ) .",

    "what if the winds give rise to some exotic nonthermal emission processes , such as proposed by chen & white ( 1991a ) , that do not get triggered in wr stars with lower terminal wind speeds or lower t@xmath65 ?",

    "though the x - ray emission mechanism in wr 142 is unclear , the hard x - ray spectrum observed by _",
    "chandra _ could be explained by a colliding wind shock onto an as yet unseen companion , though the escape of the x - rays may require a geometry with the companion in front of wr 142 .",
    "a colliding wind shock interpretation would also resolve an apparent contradiction of non - detections in the x - rays of single wc stars while wr 142 ( a wo star ) was detected . a key point not to be overlooked",
    "is that colliding winds can produce very hot plasma ( as observed ) even in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "alternatively , mechanisms that assume stellar magnetic fields such as mcws or inverse compton scattering ( as formulated by chen & white 1991a ) could play a role in the x - ray emission of wr 142 .",
