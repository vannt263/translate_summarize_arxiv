    "the search for hypervelocity stars ( hvs ) in the stellar halo was originally proposed in order to indirectly probe the galactic center ( gc ) at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these stars , having been ejected from the gc via binary - exchange collisions with a putative supermassive black hole at speeds in excess of galactic escape would provide the dynamical `` smoking gun '' evidence for such an object at a time when direct detection seemed remote . despite the tremendous advances in infrared instrumentation in the intervening two decades ( and the associated confirmation of the supermassive black hole at the gc ) , it remains extraordinarily difficult to see any but the brightest , youngest stars at the center of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of these young stars is a major mystery since one would naively expect that the conditions near a supermassive black hole are sufficiently hostile to prevent in situ star formation of any kind .",
    "a key question is whether or not these stars represent the `` tip of the iceberg '' in an otherwise normal star forming region or whether star formation is fundamentally different at the gc . because hvs are relatively rare , it was previously not feasible to amass sufficiently large numbers of such stars to go beyond the `` smoking - gun '' prediction that there should be young , blue stars in the halo . in the era of deep , wide - field spectroscopic surveys ,",
    "it is now conceivable to use hills original idea to exploit hvs in the galactic halo to obtain , among other things , detailed information about star formation at the gc , which is otherwise obscured from direct view , to at least a factor of 2.5 lower in mass than the young population currently being probed @xcite .    the sloan digitial sky survey ( sdss )",
    "provides an exceptional database to search for hvs that would otherwise be missed from targeted surveys .",
    "the sdss has obtained over 300,000 stellar spectra since it began operations @xcite .",
    "the data are reduced by an automated pipeline that produces reliable spectral classifications and radial velocities ( rvs ) .",
    "the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( hereafter , sspp ) further processes the wavelength- and flux - calibrated spectra generated by the standard sdss spectroscopic reduction pipeline @xcite , obtains equivalent widths and/or line indices for 82 atomic or molecular absorption lines , and estimates @xmath2 , log @xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] through the application of a number of approaches @xcite . with this enormous database of stellar spectra",
    "it is already possible to detect hvs among a broad class of stars . in particular",
    ", the size of the sdss stellar library makes sdss sensitive to f and g type hvs which require a substantially different search strategy than their o and b counterparts @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the photometric survey , the sdss rv catalog is not complete in any dimension . in this work , we examine a large sample of high - velocity stars in order to place limits on the ejection of f / g stars from the gc .    in   [ sec : sdss ] we will summarize the stellar spectra and the sample selection for stars that will be used for this analysis . in   [ sec : ejectees ] we present limits on the ejecton of old - population hvs .",
    "we compare this limit with young - population hvs in ",
    "[ sec : comp_b_stars ] .",
    "we present our discussion and conclusions in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the sample used here is part of an ongoing study to find high - velocity stars within the sdss ( knapp et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "all rvs for stars aquired by the sdss as of 15 january 2007 were extracted from the sdss database .",
    "selected objects were required to have rv errors not exceeding 100 @xmath4 and required to be free of pipeline flags indicating likely problems in the automated velocity determination .",
    "this yielded a sample of 291,111 objects .",
    "velocities were converted to galactocentric velocity assuming that the local rotation speed is 220@xmath4 and that the sun moves at ( + 9,+12,+7)@xmath4 relative to the local standard of rest in the direction of the gc , galactic rotation and the north galactic pole respectively .",
    "all objects with galactocentric rvs in excess of @xmath5 were examined to ensure the sample was free of catastrophic velocity errors .",
    "this process yielded a total sample of 33 objects with galactocentric rvs exceeding @xmath6 , which we analyze in detail below .",
    "@xcite argued that large rv samples , such as sdss , could probe an as yet undiscovered old population of stars ejected from the gc and would be most sensitive to stars near the main - sequence turnoff within this population .",
    "moreover , they argued that such surveys would be more sensitive to the bound rather than unbound members of this population , simply because the bound stars accumulate over the lifetime of the galaxy and can be seen still orbiting , while the unbound stars can only be viewed during their exit . in this section",
    ", we analyze the sensitivity of sdss to both classes of ejectees , and we tabulate the candidates derived from this database .",
    "we begin by asking what the sensitivity of the sdss survey is to bound turnoff stars and whether any such candidates are in the sample .",
    "of course , this requires that we establish selection criteria that remove the vast majority of contaminants but still retain significant sensitivity to bound ejectees .",
    "we adopt the following two criteria : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the observed rv converted to the galactic frame , @xmath9 is the velocity that the star has when it crosses the solar circle , and @xmath10 is the galactic escape velocity , again measured at the solar circle .",
    "the first criterion is purely observational ( apart from the implied assumption of solar motion ) and is self - contained .",
    "the threshold @xmath11 is established empirically from the observed velocity distribution ( knapp et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) .",
    "the second criterion requires that we specify both a model of the galaxy ( to determine the value of @xmath10 ) and a model of the photometric properties of the target population ( ejectees ) , so that we can estimate @xmath12 from its observed @xmath8 and from the observed fluxes in several bands .    for the galactic model",
    ", we adopt an isothermal sphere characterized by a rotation speed @xmath13 , truncated at a galactocentric radius @xmath14 . for this model",
    "@xmath15 $ ] .",
    "we will adopt @xmath16 , which implies @xmath17 , as a default , but will also consider other values .",
    "we will consider two classes of stars, `` f stars '' , defined observationally as @xmath18 , and `` g stars '' , defined as @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt for these absolute magnitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that these assumptions apply only to the putative ejectee population : the photometric properties of non - ejectee stars , which obviously dominate the sdss sample overall , are completely irrelevant .    from the observed dereddened magnitude @xmath22 of the star",
    ", we can then infer its distance , @xmath23kpc , and hence ( from its position on the sky ) , infer the angle @xmath24 between the sun and the gc , as seen from the star . then , since the ejectee is assumed to be on a radial orbit , its full 3-d velocity is @xmath25 , and hence its velocity at the solar circle ( assuming , as is always the case for f stars in sdss , that @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 it is immediately obvious that this equation places strong constraints on the observational parameter space in which the search can be conducted .",
    "for instance , if the star is fairly bright , so that @xmath28 , then @xmath29 .",
    "since , for this geometry , @xmath30 , this constraint eliminates the roughly @xmath31 of the sky that is not sufficiently close to the galactocentric ( or anticentric ) directions . at the opposite extreme , a bound star at @xmath32\\sim 2.57\\,r_0 $ ] can not be probed in any direction because its velocity ( and hence rv ) will fall below the threshold . at intermediate distances ,",
    "these two effects combine with different relative weights .      of the stars in the knapp et al .",
    "( 2009 ) sample , four f stars ( and no g stars ) survive as candidate bound ejectees ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "it is a curious fact that all four are coming toward us , however there is a 1/8 random probability that all four would be going in the same direction , which is too high to warrant further analysis .",
    "it is also interesting that these stars are all measured to be metal poor .",
    "these candidates could either be members of a metal - poor population ejected from the gc or simply halo stars .",
    "obtaining proper motion measurements for the candidates would discriminate between the two scenarios .",
    "initially , consider a spectroscopic survey that obtains rvs of all stars in a small angular area @xmath33 over a narrow magnitude range @xmath34 , and over a specified narrow range of colors .",
    "consider a star in this sample that is ejected from the gc , with current galactocentric rv @xmath35 , and assume that it has an absolute magnitude ( estimated from its color ) @xmath36 .",
    "the star then has distance from us @xmath37kpc , so the volume of such a survey is @xmath38 as mentioned above it has a 3-d galactocentric velocity @xmath39 , where @xmath24 is the angle between us and the gc , as seen from the star .",
    "as seen from the gc , the probed volume covers an area @xmath40 and has a thickness @xmath41 . of course ,",
    "a fraction @xmath43 of all ejected stars will pass through this volume at some time ( assuming isotropic ejection ) , where @xmath44 is the star s galactocentric distance , and it will spend a fraction @xmath45 of its time in this volume , where @xmath46 is the orbital period .",
    "hence , observations of this volume will probe a fraction @xmath47 of all ejected stars .",
    "now consider that we do not observe all stars in this volume , but only one .",
    "clearly , the fraction of ejected stars that we probe falls by a factor @xmath48 , where @xmath48 is the number of stars that satify our detection criteria .",
    "that is , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number density of stars per sterradian , per magnitude , and satisfying the color criteria .",
    "hence , the fraction of all ejected stars probed by this single observation of the @xmath51th star is @xmath52    to determine the period , we apply our adopted galactic model , first finding that the apocenter of the orbit @xmath53 will be @xmath54 where @xmath55 the velocity @xmath56 at any point in the orbit @xmath57 will be given by @xmath58 integrating the equation @xmath59 over one full period yields @xmath60 @xmath61 + \\sqrt{2}{r_m\\over v_c } \\biggl[\\sqrt{1-x } + { \\arccos\\sqrt{x}\\over \\sqrt{x } } \\biggr ] , \\qquad ( r_*>r_b ) \\label{eqn : period2}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",
    "the total sensitivity of the survey is then simply the sum @xmath63 over all stars .",
    "if there are @xmath64 bound stars orbiting , then the expected number of detections will simply be @xmath65 .",
    "it will prove useful later on to express the same result as @xmath66 where @xmath67gyr is the lifetime of the milky way . in this formulation , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mean bound - ejection rate averaged over the lifetime of the galaxy .    to understand the basic properties of @xmath70 , let us initially restrict attention to the first case , @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 if we consider some typical values for relatively faint turnoff stars in sdss ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74kpc , @xmath75kpc , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , then @xmath78 .",
    "hence , by obtaining rvs for about @xmath79 stars , one could probe a bound population of f stars ejected from the gc provided it had at least @xmath80 members .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath81 .      to determine the sensitivity of the sdss spectroscopic survey",
    ", we first evaluate @xmath82 for our two classes of stars as a function of magnitude and position on the sky using the sdss photometric catalog .",
    "this was done using 20 individual patches of sky , each with area 1 square degree , and interpolating these values to obtain @xmath82 for other parts of the sky .",
    "we then sum equation ( [ eqn : f_i ] ) over all stars in the sdss spectroscopic catalog that meet our color criteria .",
    "figure [ fig : sens ] shows the result for several cases .",
    "the three bold curves ( blue ) are for f stars under the assumption of @xmath83 and for three different thresholds , @xmath84 410 , and 420 .",
    "the solid ( red ) curve is for f stars with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , while the dashed ( green ) curve is for g stars with @xmath85 , @xmath83 .",
    "the two other curves will be explained later .",
    "several features are apparent from this figure .",
    "first , sensitivity is peaked quite close to the escape velocity .",
    "this may seem surprising in view of equation ( [ eqn : f_i_simple ] ) , which exponentially declines with the square of the velocity for @xmath87 , and then even more steeply .",
    "however , at low @xmath88 , distant ( i.e. , faint ) stars do not contribute because their declining speeds at large @xmath44 bring them below the first selection cut in equation ( [ eqn : sel_crit ] ) .",
    "most distant stars gain by @xmath89 in equation ( [ eqn : f_i_simple ] ) , at least for @xmath90 .",
    "second , sensitivity falls quite steeply with increasing @xmath11 , approximately a factor 2 for each @xmath91 .",
    "this is basically a consequence of the same volume effect just analyzed .",
    "the same effect also accounts for the dramatic falloff in sensitivity if the escape velocity proves lower than our default @xmath83 .",
    "finally , senstivity to bound g - star ejectees is about 1/3 that of f stars .",
    "let us initially adopt the extremely simple model that the number of bound f - star ejectees is uniform as a function of @xmath92 . under this assumption",
    ", we can make one test of the plausibility of the candidate population by ploting their cumulative distribution , which is shown in figure [ fig : cum ] .",
    "the match is extremely good .",
    "let us then tentatively assume that the candidates are really bound ejectees .",
    "integrating under the entire ( upper - blue ) curve in figure [ fig : sens ] yields @xmath93-@xmath4 .",
    "however , from figure [ fig : sens ] and especially figure [ fig : cum ] , it is clear that about 75% of this sensitivity comes from the roughtly @xmath94 interval in which the four candidates are detected .",
    "therefore , if these candidates are accepted as real , we can infer an ejection rate @xmath95 of course , if some or all of the candidates are later vetted and found wanting , the smaller number of detections would then yield an analagous upper limit .",
    "since the g - star sensitivity is smaller and we find no candidates , the g stars are consistent with a similar rate , but with weaker statistics .",
    "we select candidate unbound ejected stars with exactly the criterion as bound stars ( eq .  [ [ eqn : sel_crit ] ] ) , except reversing the sign on the second condition , @xmath96 , and of course demanding that they be exiting rather than entering the galaxy .",
    "then , following a very similar derivation to the one given for equations ( [ eqn : f_i ] ) and ( [ eqn : gamma_thresh ] ) , we immediately derive their analogs for the unbound case , @xmath97 this quantity is shown in figure [ fig : sens ] as a function of @xmath9 for f stars ( bold dashed , magenta ) and g stars ( dotted , cyan ) for the case @xmath16 , @xmath98 .",
    "nothing prevents us from evaluating equation ( [ eqn : t_i ] ) even below @xmath10 , and we display the extensions of these curves in figure [ fig : sens ] .",
    "their physical meaning is that it is possible to detect bound ejectees during their first orbit , and for orbital times of order or longer than @xmath99 , this is actually a more accurate representation of the detection rate than averaging over a full orbits .",
    "thus , the bound rate is really the maxium of the bound curve and extension of the unbound curve .",
    "there is one f star candidate that survives our selection criteria and one g star .",
    "the proper motions for both of these stars are inconsistent with a galactocentric origin as we now show .",
    "were it ejected from the gc , based on its current position , a star should exhibit a proper motion in the direction @xmath100 where @xmath101 is measured from galactic north through east .",
    "the f star candidate has a measured proper motion from sdss @xcite of @xmath102 at @xmath103 ( with small errors )  significantly in conflict with the predicted value @xmath104 .",
    "unlike the f star , the g star candidate can not be discarded based on the its proper - motion direction alone .",
    "the measured proper motion of @xmath105 is sufficiently small that the measured direction of @xmath106 is poorly determined given the errors .",
    "we therefore compare the predicted and observed _ vector _ proper motions , which ( unlike the case of the f star ) require a distance estimate . from its @xmath22 magnitude",
    "we estimate a distance of @xmath107 , and it is therefore expected to be moving at 14@xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "the magnitude of the vector difference of the expected and observed proper motions is @xmath110 , which is to be compared to the typical errors of @xmath111 @xcite , making it unlikely that this star is an unbound ejectee .    since @xmath112 is essentially constant in the unbound regime at ( 0.05 myr)@xmath113 for f stars and ( 0.01 myr)@xmath113 for g stars , this lack of detections places an upper limit on the ejection of unbound f and g stars of @xmath114 at 95% confidence",
    ".    equation ( [ eqn : unbound_f_g ] ) is broadly consistent with equation ( [ eqn : gamma_eval ] ) .",
    "the brown et al . ( 2007 ) survey in essence covered an entire volume of galaxy rather than a scattering of targets within the galaxy , like sdss .",
    "thus , to calculate @xmath112 one should perform a volume integral .",
    "an argument similar to the one given in ",
    "[ sec : bound_sensitivity ] leads to the equation @xmath115 ^",
    "2[v^2 - 2v_c^2\\ln(r / r_0)]^{1/2 } } \\label{gamma_brown}\\ ] ] where we have for convenience assumed the form of the galactic potential within @xmath26 .",
    "we esitmate this expression for the brown et al .",
    "( 2007 ) survey by noting that it covered an area @xmath116 and that most of the sensitivity was in regions where @xmath117 , by adopting an average value for the velocity in the denominator of @xmath118 , and approximating @xmath119kpc .",
    "we then obtain @xmath120 .",
    "hence the four detections imply @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the upper limit given by equation ( [ eqn : unbound_f_g ] ) shows that f - star ejectees are no more than 100 times more common than b - star ejectees .",
    "since f stars themselves are about 100 times more common than b stars in the galaxy as a whole , this result is already of some interest .",
    "nevertheless , it would certainly be better to achieve at least a few times better sensitivity .",
    "we have presented the first limit on old - population ejectees from the galactic center based on data obtained with the sdss .",
    "we have shown that the ejection of f / g stars is no more than 100 times more common than o / b star ejectees .",
    "we note that this limit is obtained simply from analyzing the stellar spectra obtained by sdss as part of its main projects , _ not _ via a survey designed to preferentially select these objects .",
    "already , this limit suggests that the mass function at the galactic center is not weighted toward low mass star formation  a fact impossible to determine by direct imaging of the gc alone .",
    "because these candidates are all found to be metal poor ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , they may be part of the metal - poor halo in which case , this limit is even stronger .",
    "proper motion measurements would determine whether they are indeed ejectees from the gc and thereby make this limit more stringent .",
    "ongoing surveys , such as the second epoch of the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue - ii ) , will determine conclusively if star - formation at the gc is indeed weighted heavily toward young , massive stars .",
