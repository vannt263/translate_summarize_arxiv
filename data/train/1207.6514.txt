    "we consider a known problem in pre - disaster planning : forming an investment plan for a transportation network , with the aim of facilitating rescue operations in the case of earthquakes .",
    "multi - stage stochastic problems occur in many real - life situations and are often tackled by stochastic programming ( sp ) methods based on integer or mathematical programming .",
    "these methods are guaranteed to find an optimal solutions , but because of the complexity of the problems they may only be practicable for small instances .",
    "the use of metaheuristics such as tabu search , simulated annealing , genetic algorithms and ant colony optimisation is another promising approach to such problems . though not guaranteed to find optimal solutions , metaheuristics can often find near - optimal solutions in a reasonable time . but applying metaheuristics requires the computation of an objective function ( or fitness ) , which can be prohibitively expensive for stochastic problems . a common way of reducing the computational effort is approximation by scenario sampling .",
    "we propose an alternative method to sampling for the earthquake problem , which does not involve approximation but which makes the fitness computation tractable .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ problem ] describes the problem and an existing approach to solving it .",
    "section [ heur ] outlines a standard metaheuristic approach and points out its impracticality .",
    "section [ method ] describes our method .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the problem is taken from peeta _ et al .",
    "consider the transportation network in figure [ istanbul ] ( not drawn to scale ) , with nodes numbered 125 and arcs numbered 130 , each of whose arcs ( which we shall refer to as _ links _ ) may fail with some probability .",
    "this network is modelled on the istanbul highway network .",
    "the failure probability of a link can be reduced by investing money in it , and we have a budget limiting the total investment .",
    "we aim to minimise the expected shortest path between a specified source and sink node in the network .",
    "more generally , we aim to minimise a weighted sum of shortest path lengths between several source - sink pairs , chosen ( for example ) to represent paths between hospitals and areas of high population .",
    "this is an example of pre - disaster planning , where a decision maker aims to maximise the robustness of a transportation network with respect to possible disasters in order to facilitate rescue operations .",
    "first some notation .",
    "represent the network as an undirected graph @xmath0 with nodes @xmath1 and arcs or links @xmath2 . for each link @xmath3 define a binary decision variable @xmath4 which is 1",
    "if we invest in that link and 0 otherwise .",
    "define a binary random variable @xmath5 which is 1 if link @xmath6 survives and 0 if it fails .",
    "denote the survival ( non - failure ) probability of link @xmath6 by @xmath7 without investment and @xmath8 with , the investment required for link @xmath6 by @xmath9 , the length of link @xmath6 by @xmath10 , and the budget by @xmath11 .",
    "if source and sink are unconnected then the path length is taken to be a fixed number @xmath12 representing ( for example ) the cost of using a helicopter .",
    "actually , if they are only connected by long paths then they are considered to be unconnected , as in practice rescuers would resort to alternatives such as rescue by helicopter or sea .",
    "so peeta _ et al .",
    "_ only consider a few shortest paths for each source - sink pair , as shown in table [ shortpaths ] .",
    "we shall refer to these as the _ allowed paths_. in each case @xmath12 is chosen to be the smallest integer that is greater than the longest allowed path length .",
    "they also consider a larger value of @xmath13 that places a greater importance on connectivity .",
    "let us replace @xmath12 by 2 new constants : @xmath14 is the length below which a path is allowed , while @xmath15 is the penalty imposed when no allowed path exists .",
    ".allowed paths [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      we aim to minimise the expected weighted sum of shortest path lengths @xmath16 between several source - sink pairs : @xmath17 for weights @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , there is likely to be little interchangeability in this problem , especially if ( as we would expect ) the pairs are chosen to cover most of the network : for a given link to be irrelevant to the lengths of several paths is much less likely than for one path .",
    "but we can avoid this drawback by rewriting the objective function as : @xmath19 so that each path is treated separately , and can be evaluated using its own link permutation .",
    "if we do this using the permutations shown in table [ redtab ] the total number of multiscenarios is 343 , so to evaluate an investment plan we need consider only this many multiscenarios : a very tractable .",
    "note that we compute fitness exactly , so the optimal investment plan is guaranteed to occur in the search space of the genetic algorithm ( though the algorithm is not guaranteed to find it ) .",
    "note that it is easy to change the objective function in a genetic algorithm .",
    "sp researchers have recently explored _ risk - averse _ disaster planning including transportation networks @xcite , and we can use risk - averse objective functions such as _ conditional value - at - risk _ ( cvar ) for a single source - sink pair . for multiple pairs we can take a weighted sum of cvars . for our method to work well , we must optimise some function of statistical parameters computed on each pair separately .",
    "in future work we shall implement metaheuristic and exact algorithms to solve the reduced problem .",
    "we shall also apply the reduction technique to other problems .",
