    "the highly correlated f electrons in rare earth materials have challenged the reliability of the results obtained by conventional density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "it is generally believed that regular dft in its lda / gga formulation , without any modification , is insufficient to correctly deal with the f electrons ; hence our understanding of the physical properties of these systems are often based on a many body model hamiltonian or modified lda such as lda+u @xcite , lda+sic @xcite , and lda+(open core ) @xcite approaches .",
    "strange et.al @xcite , by removing the spurious self - interaction of f electrons reported a systematic investigation of the rare earth elements and their sulfides .",
    "they confirmed the pre - claimed idea that there are two types of f electrons in these materials : localized core - like f electrons that determine the valency , and delocalized band - like f electrons that are formed through hybridization with the s - d bands and which participate in bonding .",
    "the main feature of their calculation was based on an f band splitting into two sub - bands one occupied , and the other unoccupied .    in a recent publication we investigated the valency of rare earths in rin@xmath0 ; ( r = sm , eu , gd ) and rsn@xmath0 ; ( r = tm , yb , lu ) and calculated the electric field gradient using dft without spin polarization @xcite .",
    "we found out that in regular dft as all f electrons are treated as band electrons , consequently their density of states are all located in a single peak at the fermi level which is not consistent with reality .",
    "we finally overcame this drawback by applying open core approach .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of spin polarization on structural properties and the gradient of electric field of the same samples .",
    "our objective is to investigate the borderline of lda ability , that without any modification further than spin polarization can obtain reliable results for some compounds with highly correlated f electrons .",
    "our calculations confirm the fact that in most cases spin polarization , without using lda+u , lda+sic , or even open core modification can treat the highly correlated f electrons properly .",
    "it means that at low temperature , where the system is magnetically ordered , spin polarization , by providing more flexibility among f electrons and opening degrees of freedom for spin - splitting , partly compensate the necessary coulomb correlation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follow . in section",
    "ii we present the calculational details .",
    "section iii deals with the results and discussions .",
    "finally , we conclude this work with a summary in section iv .",
    "we utilize the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method within density functional theory . in this method",
    "wavefunctions , charge density , and potential are expanded in spherical harmonics within nonoverlapping muffin - tin spheres and in plane waves in the remaining interstitial region of the unit cell . as in fp - lapw method",
    "no shape approximation is introduced for potential and charge density , then it is an appropriate procedure to obtain reliable results for the electric field gradient ( efg ) with high sensitivity to unisotropic charge density distribution around the nucleus .",
    "the efg tensor is defined as the second derivative of the coulomb potential with respect to the cartesian coordinate at the nucleus , which is written as a traceless tensor .",
    "the coulomb potential which is one of the crucial quantities of an accurate ( full - potential ) band structure calculation is given in lapw as lattice harmonics expansion inside the atomic spheres . in this representation , the required derivatives can be determined straightforwardly , and the largest component of efg tensor can be obtained directly from the l=2 , m=0 component of the potential expansion inside the muffin tin spheres@xcite : @xmath1 it is assumed that the main axis of the efg tensor points towards z direction .",
    "the radial potential coefficient @xmath2 near the nucleus ( @xmath3 ) for a given charge density is obtained numerically by solving poisson s equation using a method proposed by weinert @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed using the wien97 code developed by blaha and coworkers @xcite , which has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems . in this code core and valence states separated by their energy",
    "are treated differently .",
    "core states are treated within multiconfiguration relativistic dirac - fock approach while valence states are only scalar relativistic with an exception of @xmath4 for which the spin - orbit coupling in a second order variational steps were included during self - consistent calculations of valence state . in the later case",
    "the number of symmetry was reduced from 48 to 16 by assuming z - direction as a preferentional direction of the coupled spin to the orbit .",
    "it was shown that by including the spin - orbit interaction the results does not change substantially , and as the incorporation of this coupling is very time consuming then it was neglected throughout the calculation . for better treatment of the core electrons we decomposed them into high lying semicore and deeper true core states .",
    "as the electronic charge of semicore states are not completely confined inside the respective muffin - tin spheres , therefore we treated them as band states in the full ( nonspherical ) potential .",
    "for these states in addition to the usual lapw basis we included local orbitals to increase the flexibility of the basis set @xcite , and being able to use a sufficiently fine k sampling .",
    "this procedure results the more accurate calculation of efg , which is extremely sensitive to the basis set @xcite .",
    "the true core states were treated atomic like in the self - consistent muffin - tin potential . in our calculations",
    "electronic states with an energy of at least 6 ry below the fermi energy were considered as true core states . for the muffin - tin radius of rare earth elements as well as sn and in a value of 2.65 a.u .",
    "were chosen throughout while for the cd impurity manipulated into the rsn@xmath0/in@xmath0 compounds a radius of 2.5 a.u . was used .",
    "the maximum angular momentum quantum number l as a cutoff for expanding the kohn - sham wavefunctions in terms of lattice harmonics inside the muffin - tin spheres was confined to @xmath5 .",
    "the potential and charge density was expanded inside the atomic spheres in crystal harmonics up to l=6 .",
    "the wavefunctions in the interstitial region were expanded in plane waves with a cutoff of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the smallest muffin - tin radius in the unit cell .",
    "the periodic charge density and potential were fourier expanded up to @xmath8 .",
    "we adjusted the value of mixing parameter of charge density to 0.1 and used broyden s scheme .",
    "we have taken a mesh of 165 special k points to implement the valence state integration in the irreducible wedge of the brillioun zone ( bz ) that correspond to the grids @xmath9 in the scheme of monkhorst - pack @xcite .",
    "the mesh of k points , charge density and potential expansion cutoff and finally muffin - tin radii were allowed to vary for ensuring the convergence .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy was calculated within the local density approximation ( lda ) based on the perdew - zunger parameterization @xcite , with and without including advanced generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using perdew - burke - ernzerhof parameterization @xcite , with and without considering spin polarization . for spin",
    "polarized calculations , a ferromagnetic moment was imposed on r at the start of the selfconsistency cycle . as for some compounds",
    "this is not the true magnetic order @xcite , such an assumtion should be considered as an extra possible source of error . at the end of selfconsistency cycle ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 came out to be nonmagnet , all others remained ferromagnetic . in order to calculate the electric field gradient at cd site as a representation of an impurity atom in each compound all sides of the unit cell were doubled to construct a supercell with 16 atoms @xcite .",
    "further increase of the sides of supercell did not change the results significantly . to keep the same accuracy with the previous primitive unit cell",
    "the mesh of k points in supercell was reduced to 75 corresponding to the @xmath12 grids .",
    "the energy for each orbital in @xmath4 , and in @xmath10 is linearized by selecting the most probable energy calculated for each density of state over the valence and semicore energy windows .",
    "the linearizations obtained for @xmath4 and @xmath10 then are used as an initial input for the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the @xmath15 , @xmath11 , respectively and we allow the program to search automatically for the best - linearized energies of cd orbitals and check if they are perfect .",
    "by calculating the total energy of a primitive unit cell as a function of its volume and fitting the data with the birch equation of state @xcite we obtained the lattice parameters , bulk moduli , and the pressure derivative of the bulk moduli for rsn@xmath0 ( r = sm , eu , gd ) and rin@xmath0 ( r = tm , yb , lu ) by lda , gga , gga+sp , gga + open core ( valence 2 , 2.5 and 3 ) approaches .",
    "these results along with the experimental data are listed in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    ".[table1]the comparison of the measured lattice parameters in @xmath16 at t=300k with the theoretical values calculated at t=0k within lda , gga without spin polarization ( gga ) , gga with spin polarization ( gga+sp ) , and gga+open core ( valence 2 , 2.5 , 3 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the end to analyze the up and down contributions to vzz on cd , sn and in in the listed compound we concentrate , as an example , on sn site in @xmath4 .",
    "the spin up and down dos and their corresponding @xmath17 and @xmath18 on sn cites are shown in fig2 .",
    "first of all , it is seen that spin polarization has splited the up and down f peaks ( fig2.a , and b ) .",
    "this feature is compatible with reality . in nature",
    "there are two types of f electrons , localized and nonlocalized , and as a result of that the f band should split into two sub - bands . in regular gga as the strong correlation between the f electrons are not treated properly , then all of them are located in a single peak at @xmath19 .",
    "hence it is not unjustified to expect that magnetism push the system in the right direction .",
    "how the f - peak splitting affects @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and consequently efg ?",
    "fig2c and d show the changes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with energy for up and down spin separately .",
    "below -4ev the two set of curves coincide . in the region",
    "[ -4 , 0 ] ev @xmath21 is slightly larger than @xmath22 .",
    "this difference is more visible at around -1 ev , which is the location of @xmath23 peak .",
    "one can conclude that the sn @xmath24-electrons in the xy - plane hybridizes with the f - electrons of the neighboring rare earths ( which are all 4 in the xy - plane ) . in fig.3 the anisotropy function @xmath25",
    "is given for two spin directions ( call it @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "at fermi level , @xmath28 is slightly larger than @xmath29 .",
    "exactly the same was seen for @xmath30 in table [ table3 ] , which demonstrates once more that the p - anisotropy really reflects the behavior of @xmath30 . as we already expected from @xmath17 and @xmath31 curves ,",
    "no difference is observed between the two curves below -4 ev . in the region",
    "[ -4 , 0 ] @xmath26 is larger than @xmath27 and at around -1 ev @xmath24 anisotropy shows a clear peak .",
    "this is due to the @xmath23 peak located in this area .",
    "we employed the fp - lapw method to calculate the structural properties of rsn@xmath0 ( r = sm , eu , gd ) and rin@xmath0 ( r = tm , yb , lu ) by lda , gga , gga+sp , and gga+open core ( valence 2 , 2.5 , and 3 ) approaches . for eu and yb compounds open core and for other compounds gga+sp results are in better agreement with experiment .",
    "we also calculated the efg at sn , in , and impurity cd sites in rsn@xmath0 ( r = sm , eu , gd ) and rin@xmath0 ( r = tm , yb , lu ) compounds . here also , the results obtained by gga+sp are in better agreement with experiment .",
    "the reasonable agreement of the results calculated by gga+sp with experiment confirm the fact that even for such highly correlated systems the spin splitting introduced by magnetism can compensate the strong coulomb correlation .",
    "our approach has the advantage of treating the localized and itinerant electronic states on the same common footing .",
