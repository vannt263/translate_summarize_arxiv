    "partition functions are interesting diffeomorphism invariants of manifolds that can be recovered from cutting the ( possibly complicated ) manifold into simple pieces .",
    "for instance , for a 2-dimensional topological field theory , it suffices to know the space of states for the circle and the partition function for the disk and the pair of pants to recover the partition function on any oriented surface .",
    "our program@xcite is to construct quantum field theories on manifolds with boundary , compatible with cutting - pasting in atiyah - segal sense , from perturbative path integral quantization of gauge theories in the batalin - vilkovisky formalism .",
