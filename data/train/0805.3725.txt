    "various problems of immediate social and economical interest , ranging from the likelihood of power outages @xcite and internet congestion @xcite to the affordability of public transportation @xcite , are ultimately constrained by the extent to which the assignment of capabilities matches supply and demand under realistic conditions .",
    "continuous effort has been made to enhance the performance and limit the cost of individual system components , such as power transmission lines , computer routers and roads , with outcomes impacting the efficiency of virtually all infrastructure systems . yet",
    ", the relation between the _ large - scale _ allocation and actual usage of resources in distributed infrastructure systems remains essentially unexplored and unexplained .",
    "for example , in a system as costly and up - to - date as the internet router network , we find that on average more than 94% of the available bandwidth remains unused , which is comparable to the usage of data networks reported in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we investigate this problem by focusing on the relationship between _ capacity _ and _ load_. we first note that the activity of many infrastructure systems can be modeled as a network transport process .",
    "for example , website browsing and e - mail communication are based on packet transport through the internet , movement of people and goods is heavily based on road , rail , and air transportation networks , while the provision of public utility services depends on the transport of energy , water and gas carried by power grids and other supply networks . in these examples ,",
    "the transport of packets , passengers , and physical quantities creates traffic loads that must be handled by nodes and links of the underlying networks . in order to provide stable functioning",
    ", the capacities of nodes and links have to be large enough to handle the loads under variable conditions .",
    "on the other hand , the capacities are limited by cost and availability of resources , which increases the probability of failures if loads increase .",
    "proper allocation of capacities is thus a basic requirement for the robust and efficient operation of infrastructure networks .",
    "the recent realization that numerous systems can be modeled within the common framework of complex networks @xcite has stimulated many theoretical studies on structural resilience @xcite and congestion problems @xcite as well as cascading failure @xcite and cascade control analysis @xcite .",
    "studies of air transportation networks @xcite , in particular , have shown that the strengths of the network connections may follow a pattern partially determined by the network topology @xcite . however , despite much advance , the determination of the capacity and load characteristics of real networks is a question that goes beyond previous complex network research .    here",
    "we study this question from the perspective of a decentralized optimization between _ robustness _ and _ cost_. we analyze four types of infrastructure networks , the air transportation , highway , power - grid and internet router system .",
    "we find empirically that the capacity - load relation is mainly determined by the relative importance given to the cost and exhibits an unanticipated nonlinear behavior , which , as shown schematically in , is very different from the constant  @xcite , random  @xcite , and linear  @xcite assignments of capacities considered in previous models ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we study this nonlinearity using the concept of _ unoccupied capacity _ , which we defined as the difference between the capacity and the time - averaged load .",
    "it follows that the percentage of unoccupied capacity is smaller for network elements with larger capacities .",
    "we demonstrate the observed behavior using a traffic model devised to minimize the probability of overloads in a scenario of fluctuating traffic and limited availability of resources .",
    "this model accommodates the interpretation that the empirical distributions follow from a decentralized evolution in which capacities and loads are ( re)allocated in response to network stress caused by increasing load demand . in the us power grid , for example , the load demand increases by 2% per year and detectable blackouts occur on an average of one every @xmath0 days @xcite . despite being driven by a decentralized process",
    ", the long term accumulation of local changes can give rise to an organized pattern in the capacity - load relation , suggesting similarities between network evolution and other self - organized phenomena  @xcite .",
    "in particular , our model shows that the reduction of the unoccupied capacity in high - capacity elements is mainly a consequence of the reduction of the traffic fluctuations for higher loads , but it also shows that the probability of overloads can be larger on elements with _",
    "larger _ capacities .",
    "these results should enable researchers to build models to gain insights into the evolution of decentralized systems and , in particular , to evaluate the impact of disturbances in large communication and transportation networks .",
    "we investigate the properties of load and capacity distributions in four different types of real - world infrastructure networks : power - grid network , highway network , internet router network , and air transportation networks . in each of these systems ,",
    "the load and capacity are defined considering the type of traffic on the network , namely , electric power in the power grid , traffic of vehicles in the highway network , packet flow in the internet , and passengers and aircraft in the air transportation networks .",
    "the load represents an averaged quantity over a period of time in all the networks considered . shows the relationship between the load and capacity for the network elements in the respective systems . in the analysis of the real data , we find that the capacity - load relation depends on the specific network , but the pattern of this dependence can be understood as the result of a trade - off between the cost of the capacities and the robustness of the network . in the following , we discuss in detail the datasets examined and the empirical capacity - load characteristics .",
    "we analyze the aviation data available at the bureau of transportation statistics database ( http://www.bts.gov ) , which contains the seat occupation data of us and foreign aircraft operating between @xmath1 us and foreign airports in the year @xmath2 .",
    "flights with both origin and destination outside the us are not included in the database .",
    "the load @xmath3 and the capacity @xmath4 of an airway connecting two airports are defined as the total number of occupied and available seats of all flights connecting the airports , respectively .",
    "( a ) shows that the airway network has a very efficient capacity distribution .",
    "while there are data points with the capacity larger than the load , the capacity - load relation is very close to the line of maximum efficiency @xmath5 .",
    "this efficiency is likely to be related to the high costs of air transportation , which create strong incentives for the airline companies to operate with a high occupancy factor .",
    "we also examine a different dataset obtained from the international air transportation association ( iata )  @xcite , which reflects the operation and physical capacity of @xmath6 major international airports in @xmath7 . in the airway network",
    "considered above , the load and the capacity are defined for _ links _ ( airways ) as the total occupied and total available number of seats in flights connecting two airports , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for this dataset , we define the load and capacity for _ nodes _ ( airports ) as the peak - hour aircraft movements ( arrivals + departures ) and corresponding capacity declared by each airport we call this network the _ airport _ network to distinguish from the _ airway _ network .",
    "( b ) shows that the capacity - load relation of the airport network is close to the line @xmath5 , indicating that very large airports tend to operate close to full capacity .",
    "we examine the traffic data of the state of colorado in the year @xmath2 for @xmath8 highway segments available at the colorado department of transportation database ( http://www.dot.state.co.us ) . for each segment , we define the subjected load @xmath3 as the design hourly volume ( the @xmath9th highest annual hourly traffic volume ) in units of the number of cars per hour , which is regarded as the typical peak hour traffic volume for operational and design purposes  @xcite . since the capacity itself is not available in the database , @xmath4 is estimated from the volume - to - capacity ratio ( @xmath10 ) and the design hourly volume @xmath3 .",
    "( c ) indicates that the capacity - load relation of the highway network is different from that of the airway network in the region of small loads . while the capacity is close to the load for the highway segments with large loads , there are many secondary segments with capacities much larger than their loads .",
    "this indicates that , as compared to the air transportation network , efficiency has a lower priority in the highway network . in this system",
    ", the segments with @xmath11 may provide an alternative route for congested traffic and attenuate jamming in peak hours .",
    "however , the behavior @xmath12 in the large @xmath3 region suggests that the cost is also an important limiting factor in the construction and maintenance of the highway system .",
    "we consider the power - grid network of the electric reliability council of texas ( http://www.ercot.com ) and analyze the maximum apparent power ( @xmath13 ) , the real power ( @xmath14 ) and the reactive power ( @xmath15 ) measured at the summer peak of the year @xmath16 for @xmath17 transmission lines .",
    "we define the load and the capacity of a transmission line as the apparent power ( @xmath18 ) and its maximum allowed value ( @xmath19 ) in units of @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "( d ) shows a pattern similar to the one observed in the highway network : there exists an abundance of transmission lines with the capacities much larger than the loads . in a power grid",
    ", the robustness may be even more important than in a highway network because once a failure cascades , such as in the august 14 , 2003 north america blackout , it can cause losses in a very large scale . compared to the highway network , the power grid has larger unoccupied capacities for the heavily loaded components of the network , a feature that is useful in this case for the dispatch of power generation to adjust to specific market , weather , and demand conditions .",
    "we analyze the average packet traffic data in june @xmath21 monitored by the multi router traffic grapher ( http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/ ) in the @xmath22 routers of the abilene backbone , mit , and princeton university networks .",
    "we define the load @xmath3 and the capacity @xmath4 of a router respectively as the monthly average of occupied and available bandwidth of the network interface of the router in units of bps ( bit / s ) .",
    "( e ) shows a weaker dependence of the capacity on the load than those found for the other networks , which a property partially explained by the discreteness of the capacities in the internet router network .",
    "there are , indeed , only few classes of router interfaces commercially available , with bandwidths of @xmath23 mbps , @xmath24 mbps , @xmath25 gbps , @xmath23 gbps , and so on . routers in the same group , such as the same university or the same backbone network , tend to be simultaneously upgraded to an upper class of capacities , regardless of their actual individual loads .",
    "the substantial upgrades required by the fast growing bandwidth demand contribute to the observed large margin of unoccupied capacities .",
    "thus , compared to the other networks , one can argue that in the internet router system robustness is prioritized over cost .",
    "the analysis above provides evidence that the capacity allocation pattern can be traced back to the importance of the cost in the construction and maintenance of the system . for a quantitative explanation ,",
    "we introduce the _ efficiency coefficient _ @xmath26 of the network , which we define as the ratio between the total load @xmath27 and total capacity @xmath28 of the system : @xmath29 this quantity serves as a measure of the importance of the cost versus robustness . as the cost becomes more important ,",
    "the capacity is expected to be set closer to the load to prevent overallocation of resources , which increases @xmath26 .",
    "this tendency is confirmed in , where we show how the averaged capacity - load relation @xmath30 depends on the efficiency coefficient @xmath26 for all networks analyzed .",
    "the efficiency coefficient is @xmath31 ( airways ) and @xmath32 ( airports ) for the air transportation networks , @xmath33 for the highway network , @xmath34 for the power - grid network , and @xmath35 for the internet router network .",
    "the extremely high efficiency coefficient of the airport network may be partially related to the fact that this database refers to major airports only . however , as illustrated in the case of the power - grid and highway network , which have different trends for small @xmath3 , the overall efficiency coefficient can be dominantly determined by the most loaded elements in the network ( note the logarithmic scale in ) . , which leads to @xmath36 ( airports ) , @xmath37 ( airways ) , @xmath38 ( highways ) , @xmath39 ( power grid ) and @xmath40 ( internet routers ) .",
    "this indicates that , while the value of the efficiency coefficient itself would change , the tendency across the systems remains the same even if less emphasis is given to the elements with large @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ]",
    "having identified the capacity - load characteristics of real - world networks , we now study the empirical findings using a theoretical model based on optimizing the capacity and the cost at the level of individual nodes or links .",
    "we define a simple objective function @xmath41 for node ( or link ) @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the robustness and the cost function , respectively , and the weight factor @xmath46 $ ] represents the importance of the cost . if we choose the robustness @xmath47 ( cost @xmath48 ) to be a decreasing ( increasing ) function of @xmath49 , the minimization of @xmath41 will lead to an optimized capacity @xmath49 for node @xmath42 subjected to the time - averaged load @xmath50 , which defines a capacity - load relation @xmath30 .    in order to determine the robustness function ,",
    "it is important to identify the main source of perturbation affecting the system . while the information about the entire network is quite limited in general , the local time - variations of load provide valuable information about the vulnerability of the individual network components .",
    "here we consider the fluctuation of traffic over time as the sole perturbation that can causes accidental failure or malfunctioning due to overloading .",
    "traffic fluctuation is a fundamental and ubiquitous property of the traffic dynamics which has been studied for a wide range of real networks @xcite .",
    "recent studies have reported that in internet routers , microchips , rivers and highways , the average traffic load @xmath3 and the standard deviation of the load @xmath51 are related through the scaling @xmath52 with @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this further indicates that the capacity designed to tolerate traffic variability can be expressed in terms of the average load .",
    "we model the traffic fluctuations using a simple transport process in which a certain amount @xmath54 of traffic is created at a source node @xmath55 at time @xmath56 and moves to a destination node @xmath57 along a predetermined path .",
    "this process includes as a special case the directed flow model introduced in a previous study @xcite , where random pairs of source and destination nodes are selected for the creation of traffic at each time step and the traffic moves along the shortest path .",
    "here we consider a more general yet mathematically treatable model that is less dependent on the details of the network structure and routing rules .",
    "a simple microscopic description of our model has been anticipated in @xcite .    in our model",
    ", we define the load @xmath58 as the amount of traffic processed per unit time at node @xmath42 measured during a time window @xmath59 .",
    "formally , we can write the load @xmath58 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a propagator of the traffic towards node @xmath57 starting from node @xmath55 at time @xmath62 and passing through node @xmath42 at time @xmath63 . for transport through predetermined paths , @xmath61 can be rewritten using the travel time @xmath64 elapsed to reach node @xmath42 as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is @xmath25 if the traffic from @xmath55 to @xmath57 passes through @xmath42 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "then , @xmath58 can be simplified as @xmath68 .\\ ] ] to identify the stochastic characteristics of @xmath58 , a reference we use for capacity determination , the measurement time @xmath59 can be chosen to be of the order of the autocorrelation time of the load fluctuation @xmath69 . then , we can obtain the distribution of loads @xmath70 for a large number of @xmath59 intervals and thereby the overloading probability @xmath71 , which can be derived as @xmath72 = \\int^\\infty_{c_i } p_i(l_i ) dl_i\\ ] ] for given capacity @xmath49 such that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "we assume that the capacity @xmath49 is physically upper - bounded by the maximum value @xmath75 and is lower - bounded by the line of maximum efficiency @xmath76 .",
    "we choose the overloading probability as the robustness function so that @xmath77 , where a smaller overloading probability represents a higher robustness in a probabilistic sense .",
    "the cost function is defined for concreteness as a linear function of the capacity , @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite the objective function explicitly as @xmath79 where @xmath73 . the optimized distribution of capacities can now be calculated by minimizing this objective function .    in order to explicitly calculate",
    "the capacity - load relation within this optimization model , we consider both uncorrelated and synchronized traffic fluctuations under the condition that every traffic creation event shares identical statistical properties . in the case of the uncorrelated fluctuations , a traffic creation event at a node is statistically uncorrelated with those at the other nodes . in the case of the synchronized fluctuations , on the other hand , we assume that every node creates the same amount of traffic simultaneously .",
    "it is worthwhile considering both types of fluctuations in view of the recent empirical evidence @xcite that random internal fluctuations can be strongly modulated by external driving forces . in the internet backbone , for example , it has been observed that the traffic dynamics is well characterized by a poisson process for millisecond time scales , while long - range correlations appear for longer time scales  @xcite .",
    "we consider uncorrelated fluctuations in which the amount of traffic @xmath80 created at the source node @xmath55 and moving to the destination node @xmath57 is completely uncorrelated with the traffic between different source - destination node pairs . in this regime",
    ", the quantity @xmath80 can be regarded as an independent identically distributed random variable @xmath81 following a probability distribution @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath82 has finite moments , including average @xmath83 and variance @xmath84 , we apply the central limit theorem @xcite to calculate the distribution of loads .",
    "this leads to a gaussian distribution of loads @xmath85,\\ ] ] with the average @xmath86 and the variance @xmath87 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath88 , a corollary of , is in agreement with the results of previous studies @xcite .    using ,",
    "we can obtain the solution of the optimized capacity - load relation @xmath30 by minimizing @xmath89 in .",
    "the resulting capacity - load relation is expressed as @xmath90 with @xmath91 where @xmath92 parameter @xmath93 denotes @xmath94 , and @xmath95 satisfies @xmath96 .      to implement synchronized fluctuations within our model , we assume the following properties of the traffic variables .",
    "first , while the uncorrelated fluctuations occur in a short time scale , the modulation that we attempt to describe by the synchronized fluctuations occur in a much longer time scale @xcite .",
    "such a synchronization can be generally triggered by exogenous factors , such as weather and seasonal conditions , or collective behavior .",
    "second , we assume that the travel time @xmath97 is much shorter than the time scale of the modulation . then , neglecting the travel time @xmath97 and using that the synchronized traffic creation @xmath54 can be represented by a single function @xmath98 , we can set @xmath99 to write the load as @xmath100 .    assuming statistical independence of @xmath101 s in different modulation periods , we consider the stochastic characteristics of the peak value of @xmath101 defined in each modulation period as a reference for capacity determination . given the distribution of the peak values @xmath82 in many different modulation periods ,",
    "we can write the overloading probability @xmath71 for a given capacity @xmath49 as @xmath102 where the average load is @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    by minimizing the objective function @xmath89 in , the optimized capacity is obtained as @xmath105 with @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is obtained by inverting @xmath109 . for @xmath82 having a single maximum , while two solutions of @xmath81 are generally possible in the equation @xmath109 , we conventionally select @xmath110 with the larger value of @xmath81 , which gives the larger capacity .",
    "the distribution @xmath82 is the final ingredient for the explicit calculation of @xmath30 in the synchronized fluctuation regime .",
    "because we have defined @xmath81 as the maximum value of many traffic creation events , the distribution of maxima in the extreme value statistics can be used as an input for @xmath82 in the model . here",
    "we numerically calculate @xmath30 for the gumbel distribution @xmath111 and the frchet distribution @xmath112 , referred to as the first and second asymptotes in the extreme value statistics literature  @xcite , which are written as @xmath113 , \\\\",
    "p_f(r ) & = & \\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha^{-\\gamma}}r^{-\\gamma-1 } \\exp[-\\big(\\frac{r}{\\alpha}\\big)^{-\\gamma } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all parameters are positive .",
    "these extreme value distributions cover two types of unbounded initial distributions , the exponential type for @xmath114 and the power - law type for @xmath115 .",
    "the third asymptote is for strictly bounded initial distributions and gives similar results as the bound of the created traffic becomes large .",
    "capacity - load relation predicted by the optimization model for different values of the weight @xmath116 given to the cost : ( a ) uncorrelated fluctuation regime and ( b - c ) synchronized fluctuation regimes .",
    "the model parameter @xmath117 is used for the uncorrelated regime .",
    "the extreme value distributions are assumed to be ( b ) the gumbel distribution with parameters @xmath118 and ( c ) the frchet distribution with @xmath119 .",

    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    shows the numerically calculated capacity - load relation @xmath30 for uncorrelated and synchronized fluctuations . in both regimes",
    "we find that the allocation of capacities exhibits characteristics in common with the empirical data .",
    "in particular , as the weight factor @xmath116 decreases ( reducing the importance of the cost ) , in all cases the curve @xmath30 recedes from the line @xmath76 and moves up towards the line @xmath121 .",
    "more important , the calculated @xmath30 shows the common trend that a larger relative deviation from the linear line @xmath76 , representing a larger unoccupied portion of the capacity , is found in the region of smaller @xmath3 .",
    "we note that our model , and hence the conclusions we draw from it , are determined by general statistical properties of the traffic and do not depend on the details of the network structure and dynamics .",
    "this generality represents an advantage over previous models based on betweenness centrality because , as shown in [ bc ] , the latter is only weakly correlated with the actual flow in the networks and can not provide information about @xmath30 .",
    "the traffic fluctuations considered in our model reflect a realistic feature of infrastructure networks .",
    "however , it remains an open problem to develop a fully realistic model .",
    "one possible direction for future research is to consider intermediate regimes that incorporate both uncorrelated and synchronized fluctuations .",
    "this is relevant for situations in which a synchronized perturbation occurs together with uncorrelated background fluctuations .",
    "another direction concerns the incorporation of network - structure dependence of traffic control and capacity determination . in the case of the internet router network , for example , previous works have shown that the capacity and degree are _ negatively _ correlated @xcite , suggesting a potential relation between the network topology and the exceptionally large nonlinearity in the capacity - load relation of ( e ) .",
    "in addition , it is valid to consider the impact of the apparent lower bound in the capacities @xcite , which may further contribute to the observed nonlinearity .",
    "our empirical results are in sharp contrast with the linear capacity - load relation hypothesized in previous work , and our model shows that the apparently universal nonlinear behavior is a consequence of fluctuations in the traffic load . because larger loads tend to result from a larger number of traffic events , the relative size of the fluctuations tend to decrease as the load increases ; considering that the unoccupied capacity is mainly determined by the perturbations caused by traffic fluctuations , this explains why the unoccupied portion of the capacity is observed to be smaller in network elements with larger loads and capacities . from this perspective , the observed decrease in the percentage of unoccupied capacity is a consequence of the law of large numbers .     overloading probability for the optimized capacities in ( a ) the uncorrelated and ( b - c ) synchronized fluctuation regimes .",
    "the unspecified parameters are the same as in . , scaledwidth=100.0% ]     unoccupied capacity ( @xmath122 ) for the optimized capacities in ( a ) the uncorrelated and ( b - c ) synchronized fluctuation regimes .",
    "the parameters are the same as in .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    however , the same analysis also reveals two surprising elements .",
    "first , the predicted overloading probability @xmath123 , calculated in using and , is larger for network elements subjected to larger loads , despite the fact that the capacities are also larger and the relative fluctuations are smaller ( ) .",
    "the explanation for this is that , although the relative size of the fluctuations decreases , their absolute size increases as the load increases .",
    "therefore , the reduction in the unoccupied portion of the capacities as the load increases is not only a consequence of the decreasing fluctuations but also partially due to the optimization of capacities .",
    "for concreteness we have assumed that the cost is a linear function of the capacity , but similar or more pronounced behavior is predicted for superlinear cost functions ( [ superlinear ] ) .",
    "second , the reduction in the unoccupied portion of the capacities is observed not only when the traffic events are statistically independent but also when the fluctuations are synchronized . for synchronized fluctuations , the sublinear behavior of @xmath30",
    "can not be anticipated from ( non - optimal ) _ egalitarian _ solutions determined by an equal probability @xmath124 of overload for every node , since equal probabilities lead to a linear dependence @xmath125 in the capacity - load relation .",
    "setting @xmath124 in , the capacity for the egalitarian solutions is derived as @xmath126 in the uncorrelated regime , while the corresponding equation @xmath127 leads to @xmath128 in the synchronized regime .",
    "therefore , while synchronized fluctuations are expected to consume more resources , the optimization of the capacities makes this less severe by allowing higher probability of overloads in components with larger loads . for uncorrelated fluctuations ,",
    "the capacity has a sublinear term even for egalitarian solutions .",
    "the real data corroborates the interpretation that the capacities are closer to optimal than to egalitarian solutions in three out of four systems analyzed .. ] this follows from a comparison between the unoccupied capacity @xmath122 calculated from our optimization model ( ) and the empirical unoccupied capacity ( ) . in the optimization model , @xmath122 increases sublinearly with @xmath3 ( except for the region of very large loads , where it decreases ) .",
    "this follows directly from for uncorrelated fluctuations and for synchronized fluctuations .",
    "the egalitarian capacity distribution also shows sublinear behavior for uncorrelated fluctuations , but the scaling exponent is different from the one obtained from the optimization model ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this difference can help determine the origin of the distributions in real networks .",
    "for the power - grid and internet router network , @xmath122 grows sublinearly with @xmath3 , consistently with the predicted optimal solutions for which the absolute value of the unoccupied capacity @xmath122 generally increases with @xmath3 but it does so slower than @xmath129 . for the highway network , @xmath122 is approximately constant in a wide range of the load .",
    "this interesting property of the highway network is an extreme example of the reduction in the portion of unoccupied capacity in the main elements of the system . for the airway network ,",
    "@xmath122 is an approximately linear function of @xmath3 although @xmath82 in can not be easily determined within our model , this provides evidence that , in contrast with the other networks , the air transportation system is dominated by synchronized fluctuations and operates close to an egalitarian solution . besides being strongly seasonal , the airway network is the only system in our dataset that allows for real - time capacity adjustment .",
    "ccc & optimized solutions & egalitarian solutions + uncorrelated fluctuations & @xmath130 & @xmath131 + synchronized fluctuations & @xmath132 & @xmath133 +    an important implication of the observed nonlinearity in the capacity - load relation is that infrastructure systems appear to have evolved under the pressure to minimize local failures rather than global failures .",
    "previous work  @xcite has established that the incidence of large cascading failures can be reduced by removing low - loaded nodes , despite the fact that this causes the concurrent increase in the incidence of local failures . in the present model",
    "this would correspond to a higher probability of overloads @xmath123 for small @xmath3 , which is the _ opposite _ of the trend observed in this study .",
    "the apparent vulnerability to large - scale failures is consistent with the absence of global optimization in real - world infrastructure networks that evolve in a decentralized way . in the case of the power grid ,",
    "for example , it has been proposed  @xcite that the evolution of the system is driven by the opposing forces of slow load increase and corresponding system upgrades .",
    "that is , the evolution is determined by a dynamic equilibrium near a point of overloading , which represents an optimized state balancing capacities and the probability of blackouts .",
    "it is likely that a similar self - organization mechanism is at work in infrastructure systems in general . while providing additional rationale for the decentralized optimization incorporated in our model",
    ", this view emphasizes that in infrastructure systems local robustness is prioritized over global robustness .",
    "we have presented a unified study of the large - scale pattern of resource allocation in diverse real - world infrastructure networks .",
    "our empirical and theoretical analysis provides evidence that in all systems analyzed the determination of capacities results from a decentralized trade - off between cost and robustness .",
    "our optimization model accounts for the perturbations introduced by traffic fluctuations and reveals that system - specific characteristics of the observed nonlinear behavior of the capacity - load relation are mainly determined by the weight given to the cost .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the capacity allocation is fairly independent of the details of the network structure and traffic dynamics , and it is well expressed as a function of the average load at individual network components . by describing both universal and system - specific characteristics , our analysis contributes to a unified understanding of self - organized patterns driven by decentralized evolution and operation , which is a problem that carries implications for the study of complex systems in general .",
    "this work was supported by nsf under grant no .",
    "in the study of complex networks , the importance of nodes and links is often estimated from graph - theoretic centralities  @xcite defined by the structure of the network . we have compared the empirical data with two widely used centralities , the degree and the betweenness centrality  @xcite : @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 denote the out - degree and in - degree of node @xmath42 , respectively , and @xmath137 denotes the betweenness centrality of a node or link represented by @xmath138 . here",
    "@xmath139 is the adjacency matrix , @xmath140 is the number of shortest paths from node @xmath42 to node @xmath55 passing through @xmath138 , and @xmath141 is the total number of shortest paths from @xmath42 to @xmath55 .",
    "the component @xmath142 of the adjacency matrix is defined as @xmath25 if node @xmath42 has an incoming link from node @xmath55 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "previous studies  @xcite have found very broad distributions of node and link betweenness centralities in complex networks , which is also the case for the real - world networks we have considered here .",
    "however , as shown in for the power - grid and airway network , whose network topologies are available in our database , the correlation between the empirical load and the betweenness centrality is not meaningfully strong .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between the two quantities is @xmath143 for the power - grid network and @xmath144 for the airway network .",
    "this weak correlation indicates that transport in real networks is a process considerably different from that suggested by betweenness centrality .",
    "shows the relationship between the degree , another widely used graph - theoretical centrality , and the empirical capacity in the power - grid and airway network . in the airway network ,",
    "the behavior of the capacity is comparable with @xmath145 found in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the power - grid network exhibits a stronger deviation from this power - law behavior , particularly for links with large @xmath146 s .",
    "therefore , the distribution of traffic loads and capacities in real networks is indeed more complex than expected from graph - theoretic centralities , such as betweenness centrality and degrees .",
    "generalizing our analysis to nonlinear cost functions  @xcite , we can write the objective function as @xmath147 and examine how the overloading probability @xmath148 depends on @xmath149 . here",
    "we consider the case of superlinear functions ( @xmath150 ) in the uncorrelated fluctuation regime .    in this case , @xmath151 leads to @xmath152 which indicates that @xmath153 is a decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "the decreasing behavior of @xmath153 is clear for an increasing function @xmath30 because the right hand side of decreases when both @xmath4 and @xmath3 increase .",
    "if @xmath30 is a decreasing function , the term @xmath153 itself becomes a decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "the monotonically increasing behavior of @xmath30 is generally valid for @xmath154 .",
    "when @xmath30 approaches @xmath76 , where the overloading probability is almost saturated , the cost function can dominate the objective function . if that is the case , the minimization of @xmath89 is achieved by decreasing @xmath4 even if @xmath3 increases .",
    "this only happens when @xmath3 is very large and can be regarded as an artifact of our selection of the cost functions .",
    "the overloading probability @xmath148 can be written explicitly using the error function @xmath155 as @xmath156 .\\ ] ] since we have shown that @xmath153 is a decreasing function of @xmath3 , using the fact that @xmath155 is an increasing function of @xmath157 , it is straightforward to show that the overloading probability @xmath148 is an increasing function of the load @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath123 is thus similar or more pronounced than for the linear case @xmath158 , indicating that the main results remain valid for @xmath150 ."
