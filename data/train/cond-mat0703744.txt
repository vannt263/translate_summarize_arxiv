    "let us consider the motion of charged particle on flat surface under the magnetic field . without magnetic field , there are various driving forces to make a motion of particle , such as , random force due to temperature , fluid mechanical force , e.t.c .. we introduce the velocity due to these forces by @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1    where @xmath2 is the mobility .",
    "then the electric current is given by    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the electric charge , @xmath5 is the particle density , and @xmath6 is the current induced by magnetic field , such as ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is electric conductivity . by mixing these two equations , we obtain @xmath9    from the iteration method , we obtain    @xmath10    the third term means the inhibition of motion due to the magnetic field .",
    "+ to solve the full equation without approximation , we set the coordinates as ,    @xmath11    then we have    @xmath12 \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } j_x   \\\\ j_y   \\\\ \\end{array }   \\right ] = en   \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } v_x   \\\\ v_y   \\\\ \\end{array }   \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 . by multiplying inverse matrix in both hand sides ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath14    if we use mobility instead of electric conductivity , @xmath15 we obtain @xmath16    next we consider the case of diffusion .",
    "we simply exchange the variable as @xmath17    then we have @xmath18    by using the charge conservation law    @xmath19    we obtain the diffusion equation .",
    "@xmath20    this shows the new effective diffusion constant .",
    "@xmath21    in this model , energy dissipation is induced by the existence of electric conductivity or mobility .",
    "the energy loss is easily calculated as , @xmath22",
    "next we consider the motion of electric dipole moment which is planar to the surface under the magnetic field applied normal to the surface .",
    "the distance of two charges are taken to be constant length @xmath23 .",
    "then the relative and center of mass coordinates are @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the motion of equations are @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the constraint force .    from these two equations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath27    first we consider the relative motion .",
    "+ we obtain from ( [ eq : relative ] )    @xmath28    by multiplying @xmath29 in both hand sides of ( [ eq : nom ] ) , we obtain    @xmath30    where @xmath31    and @xmath32 are utilised .",
    "+ on the other hand , by multiplying @xmath33 in both hand sides of ( [ eq : nom ] ) , we obtain @xmath34 this equation simply determines constraint force @xmath26 .",
    "next we consider the motion of center of mass . from ( [ eq : mass_center ] ) , we obtain @xmath35    the time integration gives @xmath36    where @xmath37 are the integration constants .    by putting ( [ eq : motion ] ) into ( [ eq : rot1 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath38    now let us denote    @xmath39    then we have equation    @xmath40    this is nothing but the equation of pendulum .",
    "+ to see it clearly , we write down the effective energy of this local system by using @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42        compare to the pendulum weight , the lowest point corresponds to the stable fixed point , which is shown in figure 2 ( left ) . on the other hand",
    ", the highest point corresponds to the unstable fixed point . note that when @xmath43 this relation is exchanged .",
    "let us calculate the kinetic energy of center of mass .",
    "@xmath44    where @xmath45 , the mass of dipole moment",
    ". therefore @xmath46    by using ( [ eq : rot ] ) , we obtain @xmath47    we define the moment of inertia @xmath48 as @xmath49    then we have @xmath50    the total energy is the sum of kinetic energy and rotating energy that conserves .",
    "the key point here is , when the magnetic field is absent , each energy conserves independently .",
    "but when the field applied , relative and center of mass motion couples .",
    "therefore when the relative motion is put in heat bath and give its energy to the bath , total energy decrease and we find the dissipation not only the relative motion but also the motion of center of mass .",
    "this mechanism gives the effect of dissipation to the motion of center of mass only when magnetic field applied .",
    "to realise the idea , we give a model in the next section .",
    "we introduce the dissipation only to the relative motion , and see how the kinetic energy of center of mass decreases when the magnetic field applied .",
    "then our equation for the relative ( rotating ) motion is described by @xmath51 instead of ( [ eq : relative ] ) with positive @xmath52 .",
    "and that gives @xmath53 instead of ( [ eq : rot ] ) .",
    "then we obtain the interesting relation .",
    "@xmath54    that is , @xmath55 is the dissipating total energy . from this dissipating property and from the form of @xmath55",
    ", we see @xmath56 when @xmath57 .",
    "the signature corresponds to the one of magnetic field , i.e. @xmath58 . then the kinetic energy @xmath59 takes minimum value at @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath60 therefore the kinetic energy decreases due to the dissipation of relative ( rotational ) motion only when the magnetic field applied .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the minimum kinetic energy is non zero unless @xmath61 holds . where the lamor frequency @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 from the existence of specific length @xmath23 we have a constant @xmath64 with dimension of velocity .",
    "then some kind of `` resonance '' occurs with velocity @xmath65 that reduces the minimum kinetic energy to be zero .",
    "+ the simulation of the motion of electric dipole is given in 3 figures .",
    "( figure 3 - 5 ) parameters are taken as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "figure 3 shows the time dependence of ( effective ) total energy .",
    "figure 4 shows the time dependence of the kinetic energy with its mean value for each one period , and figure 5 shows the trajectory of the center of mass .                from these result , our scenario that the kinetic ( mean ) energy dissipates when the magnetic field applied , is realized .",
    "next we put the system of relative motion in the heat bath .",
    "then since the energy transfers from the rotating motion to the heat bath , we may expect the similar dissipative dynamics occurs in the diffusion system .    by taking the ensemble average of equation ( [ eq : motion ] ) ,",
    "we have @xmath71    this average is re - interpreted as the thermal average due to the ergode hypothesis as follows .",
    "@xmath72}{\\int { d\\theta } \\int { dp_\\theta } \\exp [ -\\beta   h(\\theta , p_\\theta ) ] } , \\ ] ]    with hamiltonian    @xmath73    in the zero temperature limit @xmath74 , we have the lowest potential energy , that is ,    @xmath75    for @xmath76 . and    @xmath77    for @xmath43 .    therefore @xmath78    the mean velocity becomes zero when    @xmath79    this is related to the case @xmath80 as shown in equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "this is not a dissipation , but is some `` resonance '' as we discussed already .",
    "the finite temperature case can be obtained by explicit calculation as well .",

    "note that from the asymptotic expansion of modified bessel function , we obtain    @xmath88    therefore we have @xmath89    in zero temperature limit , which is consistent with previous result ( [ eq:0tempx ] ) , ( [ eq:0tempy ] ) .",
    "the thermal expectation value of kinetic energy of center of mass is given as    @xmath90    where @xmath91    the figure 6 shows @xmath92 in the unit of @xmath93 as the function of dimensionless temperature @xmath94 , where @xmath95 this function is monotone increasing function from 0 to 1 for the temperature increases from 0 to @xmath96 .",
    "therefore the mean kinetic energy has the asymptotic values as    @xmath97    the reason why the kinetic energy is finite under the infinite temperature is as follows .",
    "the kinetic energy is essentially the same as the periodic potential energy in @xmath55 as shown in ( [ eq : eff ] ) and ( [ eq : kin ] ) .",
    "therefore if the temperature increases and the energy of relative motion ( pendulum ) comes up , mean value of potential energy is always finite and so as the kinetic energy .",
    "this temperature dependence of kinetic energy is absent when the magnetic field disappeared .",
    "such a dependence shows the energy transition between center of mass motion , relative motion and heat bath as we have expected . if the temperature of heat bath decreases , the energy of relative motion transfers to the bath , and energy of center of mass transfers as well .     in the unit of @xmath93 as a function of dimensionless temperature @xmath94,width=188 ]",
    "here we have shown the new mechanism that the magnetic field connects two dynamical systems , and if one system has the dissipation , another system becomes also dissipative only when the magnetic field is applied .",
    "this mechanism might also work in many other physical systems under the magnetic field .",
    "another interesting point is that when the electric dipole is placed in magnetic field , we have a constant with dimension of velocity .",
    "then some kind of `` resonance '' phenomenon occurs and we have critical value of magnetic field which makes lowest kinetic energy vanish .",
