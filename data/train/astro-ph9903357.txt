    "the observable data on large scale structure of the universe obtained during last years and coming from current experiments and observational program give a possibility to determine more exactly the parameters of cosmological models and the nature of the dark matter .",
    "up till now the most certain data are about the largest scale inhomogeneities of the current particle horizon of the order of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 is today hubble constant ) which are obtained from the study of all - sky temperature fluctuations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with @xmath25 angular resolution by the space experiment cobe ( @xcite ) .",
    "according to them the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations is approximately scale invariant @xmath26 with @xmath27 that well agrees with the predictions of standard inflation model of the early universe ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . besides",
    ", they most certainly determine the amplitude of a linear power spectrum ( or normalization constant @xmath30 ) which does not depend on any transition processes , nonlinearity effects and other phenomena connected with the last stages of large scale structure formation . on the contrary , the cmb temperature fluctuations at degree and sub - degree scales as well as the space distributions of the cluster of galaxies , galaxies , quasars , lyman-@xmath31 clouds , etc .",
    "are defined by those processes and also depend essentially on the nature of the dark matter .",
    "theoretically it is taken into account by introducing the transfer function @xmath32 which transforms the primordial ( post - inflation spectrum ) into the postrecombination ( initial ) one - @xmath33 , which defines all characteristics of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the transfer function depends also on the curvature of the universe or the present energy density in units of critical density , @xmath34 , vacuum energy density or cosmological constant @xmath35 , content of baryons @xmath2 , and values of the hubble constant .",
    "the theory of a large scale structure formation is so far advanced today that all these dependencies can be accurately calculated for the fixed model by public available codes ( e.g. cmbfast one by @xcite ) .",
    "the actual problem now is the determination of the nature of the dark matter and the rest of the above mentioned parameters by means of comparison of theoretically predicted and observable characteristics of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "as most advanced candidates for the dark matter are cold dark matter ( cdm ) , particles like axions , hot dark matter ( hdm ) , particles like massive neutrinos with @xmath36 and baryon low luminosity compact objects .",
    "the last ones can not dominate as it results from the cosmological nucleosynthesis constraints ( @xmath37 , @xcite ) and observation of microlensing events in the experiments like macho , duo , etc .",
    "the pure hdm model conflicts with the existence of high redshift objects , the pure cdm one , on the contrary , overpredicts them . therefore mixed dark matter model ( cdm+hdm+baryons ) with @xmath38 looks more viable .",
    "the advantage of these models is a small number of free parameters .",
    "but today it is understood already that models with the minimal number of free parameters , such as a standard cold dark matter ( scdm , one parameter ) or a standard cold plus hot mixed dark matter ( smdm , two parameters ) only marginally match the observable data . a better agreement between theoretical predictions and observable data is achieved in the models with a larger number of free parameters ( tilted cdm , open cdm , cdm or mdm with the cosmological term , see review in @xcite and references therein ) .    the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos registered by superkamiokande experiment show that the difference of rest masses between @xmath39 and @xmath40-neutrinos is @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it also gives a lower limit for the mass of neutrino @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , at least two species of neutrinos can have approximately equal masses in this range",
    ". some versions of elementary particle theories predict @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the electron , @xmath39 , @xmath49 and sterile neutrinos accordingly ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest upper limit for the neutrino mass comes from the data on a large scale structure of our universe : @xmath50 ( @xcite , novosyadlyj 1994 , @xcite ) , that for @xmath51 ( the upper observable limit for @xmath8 ) gives @xmath52 .",
    "it is interesting that the upper limit for the mass of electron neutrino obtained from supernova star burst sn1987a neutrino signal is approximately the same @xmath53 .",
    "is it possible to find the best fit neutrino mass from experimental data on a large scale structure of the universe ?",
    "the problem is that it must be determined together with other large number uncertain parameters such as @xmath8 , @xmath54 , @xmath2 , etc .",
    "here we study the possibility of finding them by @xmath55 minimization method .",
    "realization of such a task became possible in principle after the appearance in literature of accurate analytical approximations of transfer function for mixed dark matter model in at least 4-dimension space of the above mentioned cosmological parameters @xmath56 ( @xcite ) .",
    "that is why that even cmbfast codes are too bulky and slow yet for searching the cosmological parameters by the methods of minimization of @xmath4 , like levenberg - marquardt one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the next problem is a choice of the observable data suitable for the solution of this task",
    ". they must be enough accurate , sensitive to those parameters and not too dependent on the model assumptions about the formation and nature of objects .",
    "the most sensitive to the presence of neutrino component are scales of order and smaller of its free - streaming ( or jeans ) scale @xmath57 because perturbations at these scales are suppressed and it is imprinted in the transfer function of the hdm component . at @xmath58 for cosmologically significant neutrino masses it is approximately galaxy clusters scale . the power spectrum reconstructed from space distributions of galaxies",
    "is distorted significantly by nonlinearity effects the accounting of which is model dependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the models of the formation of smaller scale structures or high redshift objects ( e.g. lyman-@xmath31 damped systems , lyman-@xmath31 clouds , quasars etc . ) contain the additional assumptions and parameters which makes their using rather problematic in such an approach .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropy at subdegree angular scales ( first and second acoustic peaks ) has minimal additional assumptions ( e.g. secondary ionization ) but its sensibility to the presence of neutrino component is low ( @xmath59 , @xcite ) .",
    "these data are sensitive and suitable for determination by @xmath4 minimization methods other set of parameters such as tilt of primordial spectrum @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath8 , @xmath2 , @xmath35 or / and parameters of scaling seed models of structure formation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the data on abell - aco power spectrum and function mass of rich clusters seem to be suitable for determining the best fit values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 because they do not depend on above mentioned additional assumptions .",
    "the data on rich clusters power spectrum ( @xcite ) were used by eisenstein et al .",
    "1997 and atrio - barandela et al .",
    "1997 for analyzing @xmath62 clustering .",
    "the first collaboration group tried to explain the narrow peak in the power spectrum at @xmath63 scale by baryonic acoustic oscillations in low- and high-@xmath34 models ( @xmath64 ) . in both cases",
    "such an approach needs very high content of baryons @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , that is essentially out of the cosmological nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "the second one has shown that this feature is in agreement with saskatoon data ( @xcite ) on @xmath67 power spectrum at subdegree angular scales .",
    "they have concluded that these data prefer models with built - in scale in the primordial power spectrum which can be generated in the more complicated inflation scenario ( e.g. double one ) .",
    "for reducing the number of free parameters we restrict ourselves to analysis within the framework of the matter dominated universe and standard inflation scenario : @xmath68 , @xmath28 without the tensor mode of cosmological perturbations",
    ". the free parameters in our task will be baryon content @xmath2 , dimensionless hubble constant @xmath8 , neutrino mass @xmath0 , and number species of neutrinos with equal masses @xmath1 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : the observable data which will be used here are described in section 2 .",
    "the method of determination of parameters and its testing are described in sect .",
    "results of best fit finding of parameters under different combination of free and fixed ones are presented in sect .",
    "4 . discussion of results and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "5 and 6 accordingly .",
    "the most favorable data for the search of best fit cosmological parameters are real power spectrum reconstructed from redshift - space distribution of abell- aco clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is biased linear spectrum reliably estimated for @xmath69 whose position of maximum ( @xmath70 ) , inclination before and after it are sensitive to baryon content @xmath65 , hubble constant @xmath8 , neutrino mass @xmath0 and number species of massive neutrinos @xmath1 ( see fig.1 - 4 ) . here in numerical calculations",
    "the data of last estimation of power spectrum by @xcite will be used .",
    "all the sources of systematic and statistical uncertainties as well as window function and differences between abell and aco parts of sample have been accurately taken into account there .",
    "the values of the abell - aco power spectrum for 13 values of @xmath71 @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and their @xmath74 errors are presented in table 1 and are shown in figures .",
    "other observable data which will be used here are constraints of amplitude of the fluctuation power spectrum at cluster scale derived from cluster mass and x - ray temperature functions .",
    "it is usually formulated as a constraint for density fluctuations in top - hat sphere of 8radius , @xmath75 , which can be easy calculated for the given initial power spectrum @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is fourier transformation of top - hat window function .",
    "the different collaboration groups gave similar results which are in the range of @xmath79 .",
    "the new optical determination of the mass function of nearby galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) gives median values : @xmath80 in the original form is omited ] .",
    "it matches very well the cluster x - ray temperature function ( @xcite ) . for taking into account the data of other authors",
    "i shall be more conservative and will use it with @xmath81 error bars instead of @xmath74 one .",
    "but , as we will see , it does not rule out predicted @xmath75 value from the @xmath74 limit of the observable one by @xcite for best fit parameters determined here .",
    "the cobe 4-year data will be used here for normalization of power spectra . a useful fit for them",
    "is the amplitude of density perturbation of the horizon crossing scale @xmath82 , which for a flat model with the @xmath28 equals @xmath83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account the definition of @xmath82 ( @xcite ) and the power spectrum , the normalization constant @xmath30 is calculated as @xmath84",
    "the abell - aco power spectrum is connected with matter one by means of the cluster biasing parameter @xmath85 : @xmath86 for fixed parameters @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath85 the values of @xmath87 are calculated for the same @xmath88 as in table 1 and @xmath89 according to ( 1 ) .",
    "let s denote them by @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , where @xmath92 correspond @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is @xmath75 .",
    "their deviation from observable data set ( noted by the tilde ) can be described by @xmath4 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are experimental data set and their dispersion accordingly .",
    "then parameters @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath85 or some part from them can be determined by minimizing @xmath4 using levenberg - marquard method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the derivatives of predicted values on search parameters which are required by this method will be calculated numerically .",
    "the step for their calculation was experimentally assorted and is @xmath98 of the values for all parameters .",
    "the analytical approximation of mdm transfer function will be used in the form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the transfer function by @xcite for cdm+baryon system ( @xmath101 is redshift ) , the correction factor for the hdm component @xmath102 was used in the form given by @xcite .",
    "it is correct in a sufficiently wide range of search parameters ( for a more detailed analysis of its accuracy see in @xcite ) .",
    "we suppose the scale invariant primordial power spectrum because the initial power spectra of mdm models now is as follows : @xmath103 .",
    "the method was tested in the following way .",
    "i calculated the mdm power spectrum for the given parameters ( e.g. @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) using cmbfast code , normalized to 4-year cobe data , calculated @xmath108 and interpolated @xmath76 for the same @xmath88 ( @xmath109 ) which are in table 1 .",
    "then i have took cluster biasing parameter @xmath110 and calculated model @xmath72 .",
    "the experimental errors for them as well as for @xmath108 i have suggested to be the same as relative errors from table 1 .",
    "these model experimental data like the ones in table 1 were used for search of parameters @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath85 ( @xmath1 is fixed and the same ) .",
    "the initial ( or start ) values of the parameters i have put as random deviated from the given ones . in all cases the code found all the given parameters with high accuracy .",
    "before finding of the best - fit parameters let s look how the power spectrum of density fluctuations at cluster scale depends on search parameters . for this",
    "we leave only @xmath85 as a free parameter and fix the remaining ones . in fig.1 such a dependence of rich cluster power spectra on @xmath5 is shown for @xmath107 , @xmath111 and @xmath106 . the r.m.s . of density fluctuations in the top - hat sphere of @xmath112 radius in models with @xmath1130.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 are @xmath114 0.93 , 0.81 , 0.75 , 0.71 accordingly .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath85 are presented in the caption of fig.1 .",
    "the deviations of the predicted rich cluster power spectra and mass function in these models from the observable ones are correspondingly @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , for the mdm model with @xmath107 , @xmath111 and @xmath106 abell - aco power spectrum and mass function prefer high @xmath5 ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "the @xmath75 s for these 3 models are 0.81 , 0.73 , 0.68 accordingly , the corresponding deviations of predicted rich cluster power spectra and mass functions from the observable ones respectively are @xmath1189.88 , 6.48 , 5.54 .",
    "so , the mdm model with three species of equal mass neutrino is preferable .",

    "the results are shown in fig.3 .",
    "@xmath75 for these 3 models are following 0.71 , 0.98 , 1.24 .",
    "the @xmath4 for all points of power spectrum and @xmath89 are 5.72 , 19.9 and 42.6 accordingly .",
    "therefore , when neutrino mass is fixed ( by laboratory experiments for example ) the data prefer low @xmath8 .",

    "the minimum @xmath4 is for model with @xmath124 .",
    "= 9truecm    as we see the theoretically predicted values of the chosen data are sensitive to search parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath65 and @xmath8 .",

    "the searching of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath65 and @xmath8 by @xmath4 levenberg - marquardt minimization method can be realized in the following way .",
    "we shall put @xmath0 , @xmath65 , @xmath8 and @xmath85 or part of them free and find the minimum of @xmath4 for @xmath1=1 , 2 , 3 in a series .",
    "the lowest value from them will be suggested as minimum of @xmath4 for each set of free parameters .",
    "this is because the @xmath1 possesses the discrete value .",
    "the key point is narrowing the range of search parameter values .",
    "the analytical approximation of the mdm power spectra used here is accurate enough in the following range of parameters : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 ( @xcite ) . by the upper and lower boundaries of @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 availability of the used analytical approximation we admeasure the range of search values of these parameters .",
    "we make these boundaries as mirror walls.      = 9truecm    the minima of @xmath4 in a 4-dimensional space of parameters @xmath5 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath85 for models with 1 , 2 and 3 species of massive neutrinos are achieved for the set of parameters presented in table 2 .",
    "the spectra for them are shown in fig.5 and @xmath89 s are presented in the table 2 .",
    "( the accuracy of analytical approximation of mdm spectra is better than 5% ) .",
    "as we can see @xmath4 is few times lower than the formal degree of freedom , @xmath129 , where @xmath60 is the number of data points , @xmath130 is the number of free parameters .",
    "the reason is that not all the points of the abell - aco power spectrum presented in table 1 are independent .",
    "the numerical experiment has shown that the minimal number of points which determine the same mdm parameters is @xmath131 ( odd points of @xmath132 in table 1 , for example ) .",
    "indeed , such a spectrum can be described by amplitude and inclination at small and large scale ranges and the second order curve at the peak ( or maximum ) range .",
    "it means that real @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , in the 5-dimension space of free parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath85 ) the global minimum of @xmath4 is achieved for the mdm model with 3 sorts of massive neutrinos .",
    "it has the lowest @xmath0 and the highest @xmath8 which better matches the data on immediate measurements of hubble constant .",
    "however , it is unexpected that the found @xmath5 is so high and @xmath2 is so low .",
    "they contradict the data on high redshift objects and nucleosynthesis constraint ( @xmath134 , @xcite ) accordingly . the mdm models with so high a @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) also have a problem with the galaxy formation , @xmath135 for them .",
    "let s analyze the cases with additional constraints which can lead us out of this difficulty .",
    "the increasing of baryon content can decrease this difficulty ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall fix baryon content by the upper limit which is resulted from the nucleosynthesis constraint @xmath136 and keep up the rest parameters as free .",
    "the found best - fit parameters are in the table 3 , rich power spectrum for the case with 3 sorts of massive neutrino is shown in fig.6 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the spectra for the cases with 1 and 2 sorts are close to this one .    as we can see @xmath5 increases when @xmath65 decreases and the minima of @xmath4 are achieved at high @xmath5 again .",
    "but they are quite close to the corresponding minima from the previous table ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "= 9truecm      an interesting question ensuing from last two items is : which best - fit values of @xmath2 and @xmath8 can be obtained from these data on the abell - aco power spectrum and mass function in the case when mass of neutrino is determined by any physical or astrophysical experiments and is known .",
    "let s assume that @xmath0 is fixed but the number of species @xmath1 is unknown .",
    "we fix @xmath5 by relation ( 4 ) and the rest of parameters leave free .",
    "the search in such an approach was unsuccessful because it halted in the upper limit of @xmath2=0.3 .",

    "results for @xmath0=2.5ev and 3ev are presented in table 4 . the rich cluster power spectrum for @xmath120 and @xmath10",
    "is shown in fig.6 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the spectra for 1 and 2 sorts are close to this one .",
    "the @xmath4 s in all cases here are lower than in table 2 because the performance of analytical approximation of mdm spectra for so high a @xmath2 and @xmath8 is essentially worse than in the allowance range .",
    "therefore we can not conclude that the global minimum of @xmath4 in the 4-dimension space of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 is in the range of high @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is in point with the parameters which are in the last row of table 2 .",
    "but we certainly conclude that when @xmath139 the minimum is absent in the range of @xmath127 , @xmath140 .",
    "therefore the abell - aco power spectrum and mass function among the mdm models with @xmath141 and @xmath128 prefer @xmath142 and @xmath143 that agrees well with the results by @xcite .",
    "one can look now which @xmath8 is preferable by abell - aco power spectrum and mass function when neutrino mass and baryon content are fixed by the other observable constraints or theoretical arguments .",
    "let s put that @xmath120 ( @xmath144 ) and @xmath20 is fixed by the upper limit of nucleosynthesis constraint . only @xmath8 and @xmath85 are free parameters .",
    "their best - fit values found for 1 , 2 and 3 sorts of massive neutrino are presented in the table 5 . the rich cluster power spectrum for @xmath10 mdm model with those parameters is shown in fig.6 ( dashed dotted line ) .",
    "the spectra for 1 and 2 sorts are close to this one .",
    "as we see in the mdm model with 3 sorts of 2.5ev neutrinos the best - fit value of @xmath8 and @xmath89 are closer to the corresponding observable data than in models with 1 or 2 sorts .",
    "rich cluster power spectra of models with the best fit parameters are within the error bars of the corresponding experimental data ( fig.5 - 6 ) . but none of them explains the peak at @xmath16 that corresponds to the linear scale @xmath145 .",
    "it has excess power at @xmath146 in comparison with the best - fit model and @xmath147 in comparison with the high-@xmath2 one .",
    "it is more prominent yet in the data by @xcite .",
    "apparently , it is a real feature of the power spectrum . the necessity of a similar feature in the power spectrum was argued earlier by the explanation of great attractor phenomenon ( @xcite ) .",
    "a sample of the abell - aco clusters of galaxies used by @xcite is placed in @xmath148 double - cone with the axis pointing towards the milky way pole .",
    "the great attractor , on the contrary , placed in the plane of our galaxy .",
    "therefore , they are an independent experimental demonstration of the reality of those peak . other important arguments for its validity come from pencil - beam redshift survey by @xcite and from 2-dimensional power spectrum of the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular correlations in the apm survey ( @xcite ) and high - redshift absorption lines in quasar spectrum ( @xcite ) also show similar features at these scales .",
    "it was shown also by @xcite that this @xmath149 peak well agree with saskatoon data on the @xmath67 power spectrum .",
    "therefore , the data used here on rich cluster power spectrum are based on the surveys which represent a fair sample of @xmath149 structures and that peak is significant despite the large error bars of experimental data .    obviously ,",
    "that turnabout to open ( @xmath150 ) models or flat with cosmological term ( @xmath151 ) does not improve the situation with the explanation of that peak in our approach .",
    "it is because the maximum of power spectra in those models is shifted to larger scales in comparison with matter dominated flat models analyzed here .",
    "explaning of it by baryonic acoustic oscillations calls for extremely high content of baryons that disagree with nucleosynthesis constraint ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we face a necessity to consider models with a built - in scale in the primordial power spectrum again .",
    "let s determine the parameters of this peak .",
    "the comparison of rich cluster power spectrum predicted by the mdm model with the best - fit parameters ( table 2 ) with the observable one showed that the peak has approximately the gaussian form .",
    "therefore we approximate it by the function @xmath152 , where @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are amplitude , center and width of the peak accordingly .",
    "we set the power spectrum in the form of @xmath156 , and repeat previous calculations with additional free parameters @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "it should seem that this peak causes such high best - fit values of @xmath5 or @xmath2 in tables 2 - 4 .",
    "the results of the search for best - fit parameters in the 8-dimensional space of the mdm+peak model parameters showed that it is not so , that well agrees with the numerical results by @xcite .",
    "the introducing of the peak really decreases the @xmath4 but the mdm model parameters are changed weakly .",
    "it is because they are determined mainly by the inclination of the abell - aco power spectrum after the peak and @xmath108 as the most accurate value of the data set used here .",
    "the models with 3 sorts of massive neutrino are preferable like in the previous cases . in table 9",
    "the best - fit parameters of the mdm models with 3 sorts of massive neutrino as well as best - fit parameters of the peak are presented for 4 cases : all the mdm parameters were free ( 1st row ) , baryon content @xmath2 was fixed by the upper limit of nucleosynthesis constraint ( 2 ) , neutrino mass was fixed at @xmath120 ( 3 ) , @xmath2 and @xmath0 were fixed ( 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 for them are 0.81 , 0.86 , 1.11 , 1.04 accordingly . in all the cases except ( 3 ) the @xmath157 , in ( 3 )",
    "case the @xmath158 . the rich cluster power spectrum for these cases",

    "= 9truecm    the introducing of such a peak increases the predicted bulk velocities in a top - hat sphere of the radius r whose r.m.s .",
    "values can be calculated according to @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the fourier transform of this sphere .",
    "so , for @xmath161 it increases from @xmath162 to @xmath163 for the best - fit model ( 3rd row of table 2 , 1st row of table 6 ) and from @xmath164 to @xmath165 for a model with fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( 3rd row of table 5 , the last row of table 6 ) .",
    "the observable value of bulk velocity for this scale is @xmath166 , which follows from mark iii potent results ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , this peak is preferable also by the data on large scale peculiar velocity of galaxies and great attractor like structures .",
    "however , the models with high values of @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) , which are best - fit ones for the abell - aco data , have problems with the explanation of galaxy scale structures and high redshift objects . but models with median @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) are not ruled out by these data ( @xmath21 ) . on the contrary , the cdm model with @xmath169 and @xmath170",

    "both classes of these models were confronted with the observational data on the abell - aco power spectrum by @xcite and @xcite accordingly .",
    "the abell - aco power spectrum by @xcite and mass function by @xcite in the parameter space of the mdm model ( @xmath29 ) prefer a region with high @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , low @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are as follows : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , experimental uncertainties of the data used here for the determination of these parameters give no chance to rule out models with a different set of parameters at a sufficiently high confidence level .",
    "the mdm models with baryon content at the upper limit of the nucleosynthesis constraint ( @xmath173 ) do not outstep @xmath174 of best - fit model ( see table 3 ) .",

    "introducing artificially into the primordial power spectrum a peak of gaussian form decreases the @xmath4 , increases the bulk motions but does not change essentially the best - fit parameters of the mdm models .",
    "it means that determinative for these parameters is mainly inclination of the abell - aco power spectrum at the scales smaller than the scale of the peak position and @xmath108 as the most accurate value of the data set used here .    hereby , the power spectrum of the abell - aco clusters of galaxies and mass function are a sensitive test for the mdm model parameters . but more accurate data on power spectrum of matter density fluctuations are necessary for more certain determination of cosmological parameters .",
