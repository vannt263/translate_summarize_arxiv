    "a successful theory of modified gravity has proved hard to find .",
    "most theories begin by postulating new physical principles , for example , the existence of fundamental fields with certain symmetry properties @xcite or additional dimensions @xcite ; see @xcite for comprehensive surveys of the current literature . by introducing such principles on which to base a theory we are immediately selecting specific directions in theory space to investigate .",
    "an alternative approach is to cautiously explore outwards from the corner of theory space that we understand best , that is , general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "one way to implement this strategy is to construct a parameterized framework that allows for small deviations from gr in a cosmological context , akin to the parameterized post - newtonian framework that has been used to test gr extensively within the solar system @xcite .    in order to extract maximum benefit from this approach",
    "we need to develop a sense of how the parameters we use impact the growth of structure .",
    "historically , our theories of structure formation have been developed using matter - dominated cosmological models @xcite .",
    "though not appropriate for realistic calculations , a toy einstein - de sitter ( eds ) cosmology remains an immensely useful testing ground for new theories ; here , we can gain a qualitative understanding of perturbation evolution whilst our knowledge of the background expansion remains on a firm footing .",
    "therefore , maintaining the principle of caution advertised above , we will consider the effects of parameterized gravity on an eds universe ( which contains pressureless matter only ) .",
    "this will be an excellent approximation to the matter epoch of the real universe , and has the added advantage that analytic solutions are achievable in some cases due to the simple properties of pressureless matter .    despite the wide variety of modified gravity theories present in the literature",
    ", a survey of field equations reveals some common features . in many theories",
    "the gravitational constant appearing in the poisson equation acquires a time - dependence and/or scale - dependence @xcite , and the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath0 and curvature perturbation @xmath1 ( in the conformal newtonian gauge ) are not equal as they are in gr .",
    "parameterized frameworks for modified gravity are usually constructed to incorporate such properties .",
    "we can ask what typical effects these generic features might have on observables : for example , in addition to affecting the growth rate of structure , distortion of gravitational potentials will imprint secondary anisotropies on the cmb .",
    "however , we will assume that modifications to gr must be negligible at very early times , to avoid significantly impacting the primary cmb and the sensitive reaction rates of big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite ; see @xcite for consideration of scalar - field models that are non - negligible at the time of recombination .",
    "this paper investigates the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the parameterized framework implemented in @xcite , for an eds background .",
    "[ section : param_choice ] introduces the necessary formalism in the context of theories that are constructed purely from metric quantities . in [ section : delta ]",
    "we use this framework to calculate the evolution of density perturbations on intermediate and large scales .",
    "two other quantities of interest are also calculated : the growth function @xmath2 , and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect that is induced in such gravity theories ( note that this is not the same as the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effect that occurs in a @xmath3-dominated era ) .    in [ section : extra_dof ]",
    "we take the first steps towards implementing a similar treatment of gravitational theories that introduce additional scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "new degrees of freedom cause a significant increase in complexity which renders a general , model - independent calculation almost impossible , at least analytically .",
    "we will implement a parameterized effective fluid approach known as ` generalized dark matter ' ( gdm ) @xcite to facilitate the treatment of these additional scalars , and consider the case in which the effective fluid has a negligible equation of state .",
    "this approximation excludes some classes of theories from our analysis , such as @xmath4 gravity , but is applicable in other cases ; we drop the restriction again in [ section : zeta ] . in [ section : zeta ] we consider a perturbation that is conserved on super - horizon scales in gr , and ask under what conditions this fact remains true in parameterized modified gravity .",
    "the conclusions of this work are presented in [ section : discussion ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of parameterized gravity , not to pursue accurate calculations for the real universe .",
    "hence the plots and trial parameter values used here are intended to be illustrative rather than realistic .",
    "no standard parameterization of modified gravity currently exists . a common choice is to introduce a free function that describes any time- or scale - variation of the gravitational constant in the poisson equation @xcite : @xmath5",
    "where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the canonical value of newton s gravitational constant , is a comoving gauge - invariant density perturbation and @xmath8 is the velocity potential of a fluid defined by .",
    "often a second free function is used to describe the ratio of the two conformal newtonian potentials , @xmath9 . by redefining this can be rewritten : @xmath10 the arguments of the ` modified gravity functions ' ( mgfs ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be suppressed hereafter .",
    "we will call this form of the slip relation parameterization b. in @xcite it was argued that a parameterization of this type is only applicable in the quasistatic regime , and that in the case of purely metric theories it implicitly corresponds to higher - derivative theories .",
    "this is true if one assumes that eqn.([ph_slip ] ) is an exact ` template ' for the slip relation of a modified gravity theory , which means that @xmath12 can only be a function of homogeneous background quantities .",
    "if instead one is prepared to let @xmath12 be a function of non - homogeneous environmental variables and initial conditions then the slip relation may not necessarily imply a higher - derivative theory ; it becomes impossible to ascertain the derivative order of the theories being parameterized without further information @xcite .",
    "in @xcite an alternative format was suggested , in which the order of derivatives in the field equations is made explicit . in this alternative parameterization",
    "a metric theory with a @xmath3cdm background incurs extra constraint equations ( see table [ tab:2nd_order_constraints ] in the appendix ) , which force the slip relation to be @xcite : @xmath13 this slip relation will be termed parameterization a.",
    "the key feature to note here is that in parameterization a the mgf @xmath11 appears in both the poisson and slip equations , unlike parameterization b. this apparently small difference leads to some degree of ambiguity in the interpretation of current constraints on the mgfs @xcite .",
    "however , the purpose of this paper is not to discuss the subtleties of parameterization choice at length ; we wish to keep our results as general as possible .",
    "we can treat both of the parameterizations simultaneously by adopting the following poisson and slip equations : @xmath14 to recover parameterization b we set @xmath15 but keep @xmath16 general .",
    "to recover parameterization a we set @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 is related to the function @xmath19 in @xcite by . throughout this section",
    "we will sometimes leave results expressed in terms of the three functions @xmath20 and @xmath12 .",
    "we wish to emphasize from the outset that there are only really two independent functions , and all expressions should be evaluated in either the a - type or b - type instance .",
    "we write our expressions in this general format because can be instructive to see whether the modified terms have their origin in the poisson equation ( indicated by the presence of @xmath16 ) or the slip relation ( indicated by @xmath18 and @xmath12 ) .    what theories map onto equations ( [ gen_poisson ] ) and ( [ gen_slip ] ) ?",
    "the answer is ` very few ' , which is a cause for concern given that the above forms are often used to obtain constraints on modified gravity from current data . to map _ exactly",
    "_ onto these parameterizations a theory must stem from an action that is constructed only from curvature invariants and leads to fields equations that contain at most second- or third - order time derivatives ( for parameterizations a and b respectively ) . by the immense power of lovelock",
    "s theorem @xcite such a theory can only differ from gr if it introduces either nonlocality or spacetimes of dimension greater than four .",
    "this is a very restricted class of theories , though examples do exist @xcite .",
    "the limitations described above can be relaxed if one is satisfied with an approximate correspondence between theories and parameterization , rather than an exact one .",
    "for example , it is frequently assumed that the perturbed einstein equations will retain the form of eqns.([poisson ] ) and ( [ ph_slip ] ) in theories with additional scalar degrees of freedom",
    ". this can not be exactly true ; any new scalar coupled to gravity will modify the zeroth - order einstein equations in some way , and we expect to see perturbations of the new field appearing in the linearized einstein equations .",
    "however , the form of eqns.([poisson ] ) and ( [ ph_slip ] ) is retained within a limited range of distance scales for some theories @xcite .",
    "to avoid such approximations we will proceed by taking eqns.([gen_poisson ] ) and ( [ gen_slip ] ) at ` face value ' , i.e. assuming that there are no new scalar degrees of freedom hidden behind them .",
    "this is the assumption that is implicitly being made if equations such as ( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ ph_slip ] ) are implemented in an einstein - boltzmann solver @xcite and used to generate isw and matter power spectra . in [ section : extra_dof ] we will introduce an extended parameterization that attempts to account for the additional scalars explicitly .",
    "in this section we will consider how the growth of cold dark matter ( cdm ) density perturbations in an eds universe is influenced by the mgfs .",
    "this is a model for the matter - dominated epoch of the real universe .",
    "the growth of structure during an epoch in which dark energy is also relevant was investigated in @xcite , using a specific ansatz for @xmath16 and @xmath12 .",
    "we will assume that any time - variation of the mgfs during the matter - dominated epoch must be very small in order to prevent them from evolving to a region of parameter space that would cause conflict with observations .",
    "this is not guaranteed , for example , in @xcite we found that cancellations between mgfs can lead to observables very close to the predictions of @xmath3cdm .",
    "hence even very radical departures from gr can be accommodated by current data in finely - tuned situations ; however , for the purposes of this paper we will assume that our present universe does not correspond to such a case .",
    "we will therefore take the time derivatives of @xmath21 and @xmath12 to be negligible in comparison to the rate of evolution of other variables .",
    "we intend to relax this restriction in future work .",
    "although we are neglecting their time - dependence , @xmath16 and @xmath12 may still contain scale - dependence .",
    "they are dimensionless functions , but scale - dependence can appear as a ratio to some special scale that arises in a given theory , i.e. .",
    "an example of such a privileged scale is the compton wavelength of the scalaron in @xmath4 gravity @xcite .",
    "the fluid conservation equations for cdm energy density and momentum perturbations are given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the velocity potential .",
    "differentiating eqn.([cdm_delta ] ) and combining with eqn.([cdm_theta ] ) leads to a second - order equation for @xmath24 : @xmath25 this is the same as found in gr .",
    "however , differences from gr arise when we use a non - trivial slip relation to eliminate @xmath0 . substituting eqn.([gen_slip ] ) into eqn.([delta_evol_1 ] ) : @xmath26+k^2(1-\\zeta)\\phi=0\\ ] ] before studying the behaviour of this equation it is useful to delineate a hierarchy of distance scales :    1",
    ".   the nonlinear scale on which clusters and galaxies form . 2 .",
    "the quasistatic scale on which time derivatives of perturbations can be neglected in comparison to their spatial derivatives .",
    "3 .   larger scales on which the above approximation is no longer valid , but are still well within the horizon .",
    "scales that are greater than our observable horizon .",
    "we will consider the solutions of eqn.([delta_evol_2 ] ) in regions 3 and 4 .",
    "in fact it is possible to derive a single equation for @xmath1 that is valid in both regions 3 and 4 , and then use the poisson equation to relate its solutions to @xmath24 ( we thank c. skordis for pointing this out ) .",
    "we will use an equivalent method that is simpler but a little less elegant .      in region 3 described above we can approximate and since is small .",
    "we use derivatives of eqn.([gen_poisson ] ) to eliminate @xmath1 from eqn.([delta_evol_2 ] ) : @xmath27\\\\ & & \\hspace{2.0cm}-\\frac{3}{2}{\\cal h}^2\\mu_p\\delta_m\\left[1-\\zeta+\\frac{(\\mu_s-1)}{\\mu_s}\\right]=0 \\nonumber \\label{delta_evol_3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the result @xmath28 in an eds universe . writing the solutions of this equation in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants and the power - law indices are : @xmath32^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in parameterization",
    "a this reduces to @xmath33 whereas in parameterization b it becomes @xmath34 it can be verified that in the limit @xmath35 and @xmath36 eqn.([n_general ] ) recovers the gr result @xmath37 .",
    "we can see immediately that in both parameterizations there is a term @xmath38 that leads to degeneracy between the effects of the individual mgfs .",
    "note that @xmath12 only appears within this degenerate combination , so it can not significantly impact growth if @xmath16 is small .",
    "we note that if a @xmath11-like mgf is implemented in the poisson equation for @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 then this degeneracy does not arise in the parameterization b case @xcite .    when @xmath39 are imaginary the solutions for @xmath24 are damped oscillations .",
    "however , since our calculation has neglected the effects of baryons or radiation this oscillatory behaviour simply indicates unphysical solutions rather than anything meaningful . to have at least one growing mode we need @xmath40 to be positive , for which the relevant condition is : @xmath41 we expect that an approximate version of this bound should be obeyed in the real universe , in order to reproduce the observed matter power spectrum - see [ sub : constraints ] . however , in the real universe the hard bound of eqn.([growing_bound ] ) will be softened by contributions to growth from the radiation and @xmath3-dominated eras .",
    "note that there is no restriction that prevents @xmath12 from adopting negative values .",
    "we wish to understand the physical mechanisms through which the mgfs are exerting their influence on small scales .",
    "we can get a feel for this by thinking about eqn.([delta_evol_3 ] ) in the context of a simple mechanical system .",
    "the last term on the righthand side represents a time - dependent forcing that drives the collapse of density perturbations .",
    "the @xmath42 term is analogous to a frictional force , which in familiar physical situations always acts to oppose motion ; its magnitude decreases with time due to the factor of @xmath43 .",
    "since we are parameterizing around a @xmath3cdm background the evolution of @xmath43 is unaffected by the mgfs , and hence can not be contributing to deviations from gr .",
    "the overall magnitude of the driving term is controlled by @xmath16 .",
    "this intuitively makes sense  if we increase the gravitational coupling strength then we expect structures to collapse faster .",
    "less intuitive is the appearance of @xmath18 and @xmath12 in the driving term , which have the ability to change its sign .",
    "we will assume throughout that always to maintain agreement with our physical notion of attractive gravity , but note that there is no such restriction on @xmath12 .",
    "the condition for the driving force to maintain the same direction as it has in gr is exactly eqn.([growing_bound ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that in parameterization a @xmath18 and @xmath12 can have counteracting effects on the driving term .",
    "qualitatively , a negative @xmath12-value with large magnitude enables one to weaken @xmath16 considerably whilst maintaining growth during a matter - dominated epoch .",
    "if parameterization b is adopted this effect does not exist because the modification to the poisson equation has no influence on the sign of the driving term .",
    "the friction term has a somewhat simpler behaviour , as it is unaffected by @xmath12 . in parameterization",
    "b the friction is unchanged from gr , but in parameterization a has the power to enhance or suppress friction effects",
    ". a value of @xmath44 acts to increase friction , but simultaneously strengthens the driving term that drives perturbations to collapse .",
    "one expects that some degree of cancellation between these two effects may be possible , even without the extra freedom provided by @xmath12 .      on large scales we ought not to make the approximation , as the magnitude of the velocity potential is not negligible .",
    "we will adopt a different strategy , using the linearized friedmann equation to solve for @xmath1 as a proxy for @xmath24 .",
    "we first adopt a phenomenological approach ( in the spirit of parameterization b ) , and assume that newton s constant is identically modified in all perturbed field equations .",
    "we then have ( neglecting a small term proportional to @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 differentiating , and using that @xmath47 on large scales ( from eqn.([fluid_eqn1 ] ) ) : @xmath48 using the slip relation ( eqn.([gen_slip ] ) ) : @xmath49=0\\ ] ] the power - law solutions are @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and . on these scales @xmath24 follows the behaviour of @xmath1 up to a constant offset , which can be set to zero by initial conditions .",
    "so the dominant mode  constant potential outside the horizon and @xmath24 frozen  is the same as in gr .",
    "however , the decaying mode is affected by the mgfs . for @xmath36 ,",
    "increasing @xmath16 will result in faster decay .",
    "this seems somewhat counterintuitive , since one would usually associate an increase in gravitational strength with _ reduced _ decay of overdensities .",
    "however , since we are working on superhorizon scales gauge issues may invalidate our physical notions of gravitational growth and decay .    in parameterization",
    "a the linearized friedmann equation is @xmath52 where @xmath53 the derivation of the above expression is described in appendix [ app : z_consv ] .",
    "note that @xmath16 does not feature explicitly in eqn.([00e_sf ] ) .",
    "newton s constant is not modified directly ",
    "instead one considers all possible additional terms that could appear in the linearized einstein equations , which can be determined up to a dimensionless function of background quantities . in the case of second - order metric - only",
    "theory the only terms that can be added to the linearized friedmann and ` 0i ' equations are proportional to @xmath1 , which can be absorbed into an effective newton s constant .",
    "on very large scales @xmath54 , so we can neglect the extra term on the rhs of eq.([00e_sf ] ) . repeating the steps we took for",
    "the parameterization b - like case we obtain @xmath55 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 in the two parameterizations converge as one tends to the gr limit , as of course they must .",
    "however , the decaying mode is not hugely interesting as it is unobservable ( unless there are some very radical modifications to gr involved ) .",
    "the important result here is that the potential remains constant on superhorizon scales , as usual .",
    "to what extent are our results for an idealized eds model borne out in the real universe ?",
    "fig.[constraints_plot ] shows the joint constraints on the mgfs @xmath16 and @xmath12 obtained using the following data sets : the 7-year wmap cmb data @xcite , the sdss dr7 matter power spectrum @xcite , a prior @xmath57 @xcite , the bbn constraint @xmath58 @xcite , and the union2 supernova ia data @xcite .",
    "the differences between the two sets of contours were discussed in detail in @xcite . here",
    "our main interest is the extent to which the constraints reflect the analytic solutions of the previous two subsections .     and",
    "@xmath16 at @xmath59 , for parameterization a ( black lines ) and b ( filled green ) . in both cases 68% and 95% contours are shown.,width=347 ]    given the restriction that @xmath18 must be positive , eqn.([growing_bound ] ) tells us to expect that @xmath60 on subhorizon scales in parameterization a. for @xmath36 we must have @xmath61 for density perturbations to grow during the matter era , which corresponds to the approximate location of the near - vertical black contour .",
    "this contour is not the result of any artificially - imposed boundary , but delineates a very sharp fall - off in the likelihood distribution for @xmath16 ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , in parameterization b any @xmath62 permits growing modes for @xmath36 , giving rise to the more gradual fall - off shown by the shaded countours .",
    "however , eqn.([growing_bound ] ) also implies that in parameterization b @xmath63 is necessary for growth of cdm density perturbations on subhorizon scales , which is contradicted by fig.[constraints_plot ] .",
    "this is not too surprising  we expect the simple bounds implied by our eds example to be blurred by the complexities of a realistic cosmological model . if models in the region of parameter space @xmath64 experience sufficient growth during radiation- and @xmath3-dominated epochs , or on scales outside the validity of eqn.([n_phenom ] ) , then they will not be excluded by an mcmc analysis .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath16 and @xmath12 is visible in both contour sets , but it is more pronounced in parameterization b. this is because in parameterization a the quadratic term in eqn.([n_sf ] ) makes it more difficult to accommodate the effects of a large @xmath16 with a small @xmath12 , or vice - versa .",
    "a cosmological model governed by gr will not experience an integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite during a matter - dominated epoch .",
    "the kernel of interest for the isw effect is @xmath65 ( in the conformal newtonian gauge ) , which in gr is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "from the standard poisson equation one has , on scales well below the horizon : @xmath67 energy - momentum conservation gives @xmath68 , whilst in gr @xmath69 , leaving @xmath1 with zero time - dependence .",
    "the situation only changes for @xmath70 when @xmath3 begins to suppress the growth rate of @xmath24 @xcite .    in modified gravity",
    "this behaviour is affected in two ways : a non - trivial slip relation will cause the isw kernel to differ from @xmath66 , and the scaling of @xmath24 with @xmath71 will be altered . then generically we expect a non - zero isw effect , even during a matter - dominated phase of the universe @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the contribution to the cmb temperature power spectrum of this effect for the metric theories discussed in [ section : delta ] .",
    "we begin by using the slip relation ( eqn.([gen_slip ] ) ) to express the isw kernel purely in terms of @xmath1 : @xmath72-\\ddot\\phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_s-1}{{\\cal h}\\mu_s}\\right)\\ ] ] using the poisson equation to connect @xmath1 and @xmath24 , we have ( discarding the decaying mode ) : @xmath73 @xmath40 is given by eqn.([n_general ] ) and density perturbations are normalised by their present values i.e. .",
    "generally one expects the growth rate of density perturbations to be scale - dependent in a modified gravity theory , whereas in gr all linear subhorizon modes grow at the same rate .",
    "however , we are modelling a region of theory space close to gr and hence we will assume negligible variation of the growth rate over the range of @xmath74 relevant to observations of the isw plateau .",
    "so the isw kernel is : @xmath75\\label{isw2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the gr limit @xmath76 the above expression vanishes as expected .",
    "next we need to compute the power spectrum of this modified - gravity induced isw effect .",
    "the expression to be evaluated is : @xmath77 the temperature perturbation observed today , @xmath78 , consists of three parts : @xmath79 j_l[k(\\eta_0-\\eta ) ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us focus on the dominant contribution to the isw power spectrum which comes from the @xmath80 term , and ignore the cross terms with the monopole and dipole .",
    "the cross - terms should only yield small corrections because the monopole and dipole terms are evaluated at the time of last scattering , and hence affect different @xmath81-values from the subsequent isw effect .",
    "we will take the visibility function @xmath82 to be a step function at recombination . of course",
    ", if we are considering a truly eds universe then there is no recombination event or time of last scattering , but this detail is irrelevant  we are only interested in modelling the real universe well after recombination . in the real universe recombination occurs sufficiently early that for practical purposes we can take @xmath83 .",
    "a standard derivation relates the power spectrum of density fluctuations today to the power spectrum of the primordial potential @xcite .",
    "the only modification to this that occurs in our theory is a factor of @xmath84 , which arises when we relate density fluctuations to @xmath1 via the poisson equation .",
    "however , this is cancelled by a factor of @xmath85 in @xmath86 .",
    "the scales of interest to us are sufficiently large that we can set the transfer function @xmath87",

    "the superscript ` @xmath90 ' on @xmath91 reminds us that we have only evaluated the isw - squared term and not the cross - terms .",
    "a plot of this power spectrum for several combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in parameterization a is shown in fig.[fig : isw ] .",
    "the normalization of the y - axis is arbitrary because we have not attempted an accurate calculation of the @xmath91s ; we are more interested in how the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum is affected by different parameters .",
    "note that our subhorizon solution for @xmath1 is likely to become invalid for the largest scales , hence the region @xmath92 in fig.[fig : isw ] is not fully accurate .",
    "power spectrum of the isw effect induced by a theory of modified gravity constructed in parameterization a ( see [ section : param_choice ] for details ) .",
    "the y - axis scaling is arbitrary .",
    "the region @xmath92 is expected to be subject to corrections . ]",
    "provided that @xmath16 is not unusually small , @xmath12 can have a significant effect on the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "for example , compare the curves with @xmath93 equal to @xmath94 and @xmath95  a small change in @xmath12 dominates over a large change in @xmath16 .",
    "the models @xmath96 and @xmath97 have the same value of @xmath98 , and hence the same spectral shape .",
    "it may seem a little surprising that a model with parameters @xmath99 predicts a larger isw effect than one with @xmath96 for @xmath100 ; this is because a larger value of @xmath98 shifts the dominant contribution to the integral in eqn.([cl_isw ] ) to later times , therefore shifting the corresponding power spectrum left towards larger scales .    in general , however , it is difficult to cleanly disentangle the effects of @xmath16 and @xmath12 on the isw power spectrum , because they appear in a degenerate combination inside @xmath98 .",
    "the rate of growth of structure as a function of redshift is often quantified via the _ growth function _ :",
    "@xmath101 in gr @xmath2 is independent of the wavenumber @xmath74 , but in a modified gravity scenario this is not generally the case .",
    "however , if we assume we are not dealing with very radical departures from gr then this scale - dependence is likely to be small over a restricted range of @xmath74 . on the scales of region 3 ( see the beginning of this section ) where @xmath102 , the growth function is simply , where @xmath40 is given by eqn.([n_general ] ) .",
    "many gravity theories introduce degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "other than perturbations of the metric  additional scalar or vector fields , second metrics , or any combination thereof @xcite . for model - independent constraints to be genuinely feasible we need to construct a parameterization that is able to accommodate such d.o.f . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to scalar d.o.f .",
    "only , which find widespread motivation from particle physics , braneworld models and string theory .    in [ section : param_choice ]",
    "the parameterization - a - based approach was to add to each linearized einstein equation all possible terms that could appear in the context of a metric - based second - order theory , which amounted to terms in @xmath1 and @xmath103 multiplied by some function of background quantities ( see appendix [ app : z_consv ] ) .",
    "when we extend this framework to include extra d.o.f .",
    "two new types of terms appear .",
    "firstly we must allow for perturbations of the d.o.f themselves  for example , in a brans - dicke theory @xcite one expects the perturbations of the scalar field @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "such new scalars are awkward to work with directly without knowing their underlying equations of motion",
    ". therefore we will adopt an alternative approach based on a scheme by hu @xcite and treat this first type of additional term as perturbations of an effective fluid .",
    "a similar approach was adopted in @xcite .    in a fully general case one",
    "should allow the effective fluid to have a time - varying equation of state , non - adiabatic perturbations and significant anisotropic stress .",
    "this would render our simple eds model invalid by modifying the evolution of the cosmological background . to proceed with our analytic treatment",
    "we will sacrifice some generality by setting the equation of state of the effective fluid to zero .",
    "it then contributes to the zeroth - order friedmann equation and supports density and velocity perturbations , but has negligible pressure and anisotropic stress .",
    "this approximation is not unreasonable ; for example , in hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite a non - local hamiltonian constraint gives rise to an integration constant which may be interpreted as a pressureless fluid .",
    "the additions to the einstein equations in linear einstein - aether theory also behave as a pressureless fluid during an eds phase , as can be seen using eqns.(15 ) and ( 16 ) of @xcite .",
