    "_ ab - initio _ few- and many - body methods have been used with great success to explore the structure of light nuclei based on microscopic two- and three - nucleon interactions . for nuclei with @xmath7 nucleons , several techniques",
    "provide practically exact solutions to the nuclear many - body problem and have been benchmarked to agree within numerical uncertainties for the @xmath1he ground - state energy and radius obtained from the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) argonne @xmath8 potential  @xcite .",
    "these methods include faddeev - yakubovsky equations  @xcite , variational approaches  @xcite , the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method  @xcite , the no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite , and the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics method  @xcite .",
    "many of the above approaches are , however , restricted to the lightest nuclei .    in recent years , the coupled - cluster method  @xcite was reintroduced in nuclear physics as a tool for _ ab - initio _ nuclear structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "coupled - cluster theory is size - extensive and scales rather gently with an increasing number of nucleons and with the size of the model space , and therefore has the potential to extend the reach to medium - mass nuclei . in this paper",
    ", we address the question of whether the coupled - cluster method is as precise for few - body systems as the well - established methods .",
    "several findings suggest that this is indeed the case .",
    "mihaila and heisenberg performed a microscopic calculation of the electron scattering structure function for @xmath2o and found excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "their calculations are based on a particle - hole energy expansion of the cluster operator .",
    "more recent applications  @xcite follow the `` standard '' approach of coupled - cluster calculations from quantum chemistry  @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "several results for helium isotopes  @xcite were found to be in good agreement with exact diagonalizations in sufficiently small model spaces and with corresponding renormalized interactions .",
    "however , except in the recent study of three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) in coupled - cluster theory  @xcite , this approach has never been compared in detail to well - established few - body methods in the larger model spaces that are needed for convergence with modern nn interactions .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to fill this gap in nuclear physics , and to place the coupled - cluster method in the group of _ ab - initio _ approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ backgr ] , we begin with a brief discussion of the coupled - cluster method , of the low - momentum interactions and the employed basis spaces . our main results for @xmath0h and @xmath1he are presented in section  [ res1 ] , and for @xmath2o and @xmath3ca in section  [ res2 ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section  [ sum ] .",
    "coupled - cluster theory was invented by coester and kmmel almost fifty years ago @xcite . during the 1970s , this approach was further developed and found many applications in nuclear physics .",
    "the review by the bochum group  @xcite summarizes the status of the field in 1978 . from there on , applications in nuclear physics were more of a sporadic nature  @xcite .",
    "this was most probably due to the difficulty of hard nn interactions and their strong short - range repulsion and short - range tensor force .",
    "mihaila and heisenberg employed coupled - cluster theory in the late 1990s  @xcite .",
    "their work culminated in the precise computation of the electron scattering form factor for @xmath2o based on the argonne @xmath9 potential combined with leading contributions from 3nf  @xcite .",
    "parallel to the field of nuclear physics , coupled - cluster theory saw its own career in _ ab - initio _ quantum chemistry .",
    "after the pioneering works by ek  @xcite , the theory has become one of the main workhorses in quantum chemistry  @xcite .",
    "the sheer number of applications and developments in that field _ de - facto _ established a `` standard '' or `` canonical '' way for how the method is being used to solve quantum many - body problems .",
    "reference  @xcite gives a summary of state - of - the - art coupled - cluster calculations in quantum chemistry .",
    "recently , coupled - cluster theory has seen a renaissance in nuclear physics starting with the calculations of ref .",
    "this approach differs from the one by mihaila and heisenberg as it employs coupled - cluster theory in the spirit of quantum chemistry and uses softer interactions .",
    "so far , the present approach has employed @xmath10 matrices for the description of ground and excited states in @xmath1he  @xcite and @xmath2o  @xcite , and for nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath2o  @xcite .",
    "the most recent calculations are based directly on low - momentum interactions @xmath4  @xcite , and the method has been developed to describe weakly bound and unbound helium isotopes within a gamow - hartree - fock basis  @xcite and to include 3nf  @xcite .    within coupled - cluster theory ,",
    "the ground state of a mass @xmath11 nucleus is written as @xmath12 is a single - particle product state and @xmath13 is a particle - hole ( @xmath14-@xmath15 ) excitation operator with @xmath16 here and in the following , @xmath17 label occupied single - particle orbitals ( as defined by the product state @xmath18 ) while @xmath19 refer to unoccupied orbitals .",
    "we take the reference state @xmath18 as our vacuum state and normal - order the hamiltonian @xmath20 with respect to this state . in practice , we restrict ourselves to the truncation @xmath21 . this is the ccsd approximation , and the coupled - cluster equations are given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a @xmath24-@xmath25 excitation of the reference state @xmath18 , and @xmath26 is the similarity - transformed hamiltonian ( note that @xmath27 is non - hermitian ) .",
    "the last expression on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hsim ] ) indicates that only fully connected diagrams contribute to the construction .",
    "the ccsd eqs .",
    "( [ ccsd1 ] ) and ( [ ccsd2 ] ) determine the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the @xmath30-@xmath31 and the @xmath32-@xmath33 excitation cluster operators , respectively .",
    "once these nonlinear equations are solved , the amplitudes can be inserted into eq .",
    "( [ ccsd ] ) to determine the ground - state energy .",
    "we remind the reader that an exact solution of the many - body problem would require us to employ the full excitation operator eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) .",
    "such a calculation is as expensive as a full diagonalization of the hamiltonian , and therefore impossible for medium - mass nuclei .",
    "ccsd is very efficient in the sense that it is a highly accurate approximation with the investment of a modest numerical effort that scales as @xmath34 with the number @xmath35 of occupied and the number @xmath36 of unoccupied single - particle orbitals , respectively .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath37-@xmath38 cluster operator @xmath39 would further increase the accuracy of the method . however , such ccsdt calculations come at the expense @xmath40 and , at present , are already prohibitively expensive compared to ccsd . for this reason ,",
    "there is need for more approximate treatments of the full triples equations .",
    "there are various approximations to the full ccsdt equations , and the most popular of these schemes is the ccsd(t ) approach @xcite .",
    "ccsd(t ) includes diagrams at the ccsdt level that appear up to fifth order in perturbation theory .",
    "it is a non - iterative approach since typically converged singles and doubles excitation amplitudes are used in the calculation of the triples energy correction .",
    "the ccsd(t ) approximation is relatively inexpensive compared to ccsdt ; no storage of triples amplitudes is required and the computational cost is a non - iterative @xmath41 step .",
    "there is also a family of iterative triples correction schemes known as ccsdt-@xmath42  @xcite .",
    "their derivation is based on perturbation theory arguments , @xmath43 here , @xmath44 denotes the fock operator ( the one - body operator that results from the normal ordering of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "all these approaches require the storage of the full triples amplitudes @xmath45 and are therefore computationally considerably more expensive than the ccsd(t ) approach .",
    "however , for cases where the ccsd(t ) scheme breaks down , one expects the ccsdt-@xmath42 approaches to perform better .",
    "the latter approaches treat the triples corrections self - consistently and also involve the corrections @xmath46 to eqs .",
    "( [ ccsd1 ] ) and  ( [ ccsd2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "these corrections thus modify the values of the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "nuclear interactions depend on the resolution scale at which details are probed and resolved .",
    "this resolution scale dependence is similar to scale and scheme dependences in parton distribution functions . as a result",
    ", nuclear interactions are defined by an effective theory for nn , 3n , and many - nucleon interactions and corresponding effective operators , @xmath47 where the momentum cutoff @xmath48 denotes the resolution scale .",
    "conventional nuclear forces are `` hard '' in the sense that they have large cutoffs that complicate few- and many - body calculations .",
    "these difficulties arise from high momenta and associated strong short - range repulsion and short - range tensor forces , which lead to slow convergence with increasing basis size and requires resummations in practice .",
    "low - momentum interactions @xmath4 with variable momentum cutoffs show great promise for nuclei  @xcite . changing the cutoff leaves low - energy nn observables unchanged by construction , but shifts contributions between the potential and the sums over intermediate states in loop integrals .",
    "these shifts can weaken or largely eliminate sources of nonperturbative behavior such as strong short - range repulsion and the tensor force  @xcite .",
    "an additional advantage is that the corresponding 3n interactions become perturbative at lower cutoffs  @xcite and are thus tractable in coupled - cluster theory  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution is implemented by coupled rg equations in momentum space  @xcite or by an equivalent lee - suzuki transformation  @xcite .",
    "the evolution to low - momentum interactions @xmath4 weakens off - diagonal coupling and decouples the low - energy physics from high - momentum details  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "few- and many - body calculations converge more rapidly for lower cutoffs , which is important for extending _ ab - initio _ approaches to heavier systems .",
    "finally , the cutoff variation can provide estimates for theoretical uncertainties , which will be left to future work . in this paper",
    ", we use a sharp cutoff @xmath49 for the @xmath0h and @xmath1he calculations , and @xmath4 is derived from the argonne @xmath9 potential  @xcite in order to benchmark against the faddeev and faddeev - yakubovsky results  @xcite . for @xmath2o and @xmath3ca",
    ", we use a cutoff @xmath50 and compare to the importance - truncated ncsm study  @xcite .",
    "coupled - cluster theory is employed in a single - particle basis , and we use a model space consisting of spherical harmonic - oscillator states .",
    "the basis parameters are the number of orbitals and the oscillator frequency @xmath51 .",
    "our largest model spaces include about @xmath52 single - particle orbitals .",
    "in this section , we present our coupled - cluster calculations for the ground - state energies of @xmath0h and @xmath1he , and we compare our results to the exact faddeev and faddeev - yakubovsky energies of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we first discuss in detail the dependence on the size of the model space and the single - particle basis .",
    "the coupled - cluster calculations initially used a single - particle basis of oscillator states whose principal and angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath42 and @xmath53 obey @xmath54 , so @xmath55 is the number of major oscillator shells included .",
    "note that in previous calculations  @xcite @xmath56 denoted the number of major oscillator shells .",
    "however , we observed that the convergence with respect to the angular momentum @xmath53 is much quicker , since only low partial waves contribute to low - energy properties , while the convergence with respect to the principal quantum number @xmath42 is slower .",
    "this slower convergence is due to the sharp momentum cutoff used for @xmath4 .",
    "it is intuitively clear that a harmonic - oscillator representation of an interaction with a sharp cutoff needs a considerable number of radial wave functions to be accurate . the recent work of refs .",
    "@xcite confirms this picture and demonstrates that smooth cutoffs improve the convergence in few - body calculations .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig11 ] show the convergence of our ccsd and ccsd(t ) energies for @xmath0h and @xmath1he using a model space with fixed @xmath57 and fixed @xmath58 as a function of the maximum orbital angular momentum @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath59 we include oscillator functions with @xmath60 nodes ; for @xmath61 we include oscillator functions with @xmath60 for the @xmath62 states ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath63 for the @xmath14 states ( @xmath64 ) , and so on .",
    "clearly , the angular momentum quantum number needs not to exceed @xmath65 for the ground - state energies of @xmath62-shell nuclei .",
    "therefore , we limit our single - particle basis to @xmath66 for the following coupled - cluster calculations of @xmath0h and @xmath1he .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig22 ] , we present our ccsd and ccsd(t ) results for the ground - state energies of @xmath0h and @xmath1he as a function of the model - space size @xmath56 , with fixed @xmath67 and fixed @xmath58 . both ccsd and ccsd(t )",
    "energies converge with respect to the model space size for @xmath68 . for the largest model space with @xmath69",
    ", we obtain for @xmath0h , @xmath70 and for @xmath1he , @xmath71 the ccsd(t ) energies are within @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the faddeev and faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) results  @xcite @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    finally , we study the dependence of our results on the oscillator frequency @xmath51 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for fixed @xmath74 and @xmath67 .",
    "while the ccsd results exhibit a very small variation over the shown @xmath51 range , the variation of the perturbative triples corrections ccsd(t ) is somewhat larger .",
    "moreover , the downward trend of the ccsd(t ) energies with decreasing @xmath51 indicates that perturbative triples corrections are starting to break down for smaller values of @xmath51 .",
    "the non - iterative perturbative triples correction assumes that we work in a basis where the fock matrix is diagonal .",
    "however , our oscillator basis does not diagonalize the fock matrix , so strict calculations would have to iterate triples corrections until self - consistency is reached . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we observe that iterative ccsd(t ) improves on the non - iterative ccsd(t ) results , but also has a downward trend with decreasing @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we present calculations based on the iterative ccsdt-1 approximation to full ccsdt .",
    "ccsdt-1 includes all diagrams through fourth order in perturbation theory , but contrary to the perturbative ccsd(t ) corrections , the ccsdt-1 approximation is treated self - consistently and the singles and doubles amplitudes are modified by the triples amplitude according to eqs .",
    "( [ ccsdt11 ] ) and ( [ ccsdt12 ] ) .",
    "we clearly find that ccsdt-1 improves on the triples corrections and leads to a very weak dependence on @xmath51 .",
    "note that these ccsdt-1 results are also the first step towards full ccsdt calculations in nuclear physics .    our results for the light nuclei @xmath0h and @xmath1he",
    "demonstrate that coupled - cluster theory meets the benchmarks set by exact methods .",
    "it is therefore interesting to use this method to establish benchmark energies for heavier nuclei that other _ ab - initio _ approaches can compare to .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "o using a model space with fixed maximum @xmath75 and fixed @xmath76 as a function of the maximum orbital angular momentum @xmath53.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    next , we present our coupled - cluster calculations for @xmath2o and @xmath3ca . in fig .

    "therefore , we restrict the following coupled - cluster calculations for @xmath2o to @xmath77 .    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the dependence of the ccsd binding energies of @xmath2o on the oscillator frequency @xmath51 for increasing sizes of the model space @xmath56 with fixed @xmath77 .",

    "we present results up to @xmath83 ( eight major oscillator shells ) , which was the largest model space we could handle for the ccsdt-1 scheme due to storage limitations .",
    "the ccsd(t ) and ccsdt-1 energies agree nicely for the range of oscillator frequencies and model spaces considered .",
    "the only difference is that , as for @xmath1he , the ccsd(t ) approach gives slightly more binding than ccsdt-1 for the largest model spaces .",
    "the close agreement between ccsd(t ) and ccsdt-1 gives us confidence that the perturbative triples corrections work well over this regime .",
