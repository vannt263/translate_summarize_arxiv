    "the stepped - frequency ( sf ) signal has been widely adopted in modern wideband radar and sonar systems . compared to the conventional narrowband signal , the sf signal achieves higher range resolution , and the multiple scatterers of the target can be thoroughly distinguished . since its energy",
    "is dispersed to the whole bandwidth covered by the carrier frequencies , the sf signal attains a lower probability of interception @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , classified as one of the synthetic wideband signals , the sf signal only takes up a narrow bandwidth at any time instant , while the whole carrier frequency bandwidth can be occupied if an instantaneous wideband signal ( e.g. the ofdm signal ) is employed . from this scope",
    ", the sf signal could largely reduce the requirements for the bandwidth of the receiver @xcite .    the linear stepped - frequency ( lsf ) signal uses a fixed frequency shifting step , which introduces a `` ridge '' in its ambiguity function ( af ) .",
    "this causes a coupling problem between the range and doppler dimensions @xcite . for the random stepped - frequency ( rsf )",
    "signal , however , with the carrier frequencies of the pulses randomly distributed over a given bandwidth , its af appears in a thumbtack alike shape , where the range and doppler dimensions are completely decoupled @xcite .",
    "the resolutions in both dimensions thus meet further improvements , and the range ambiguity is efficiently suppressed .",
    "besides , as the frequency shifting codeword of the rsf signal is usually highly self - correlated and hard to track , the interference between adjacent radars can be largely reduced , whereas the electronic counter - countermeasures ( eccm ) capabilities can be also acquired @xcite . as a result ,",
    "parameter estimation with the rsf signal is of great practical significance and is gaining increasing research interests .",
    "the joint estimation of time delay and doppler - stretch is a fundamental problem that facilitates target tracking and localization in radar and sonar systems , upon which the location and velocity information of the target is managed to be attained @xcite .",
    "one of the standard methods for joint delay - doppler estimation is to adopt the af @xcite . by locating the peak of the af",
    ", the joint estimation was primarily implemented @xcite .",
    "so as to evaluate the performance of the estimation , the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) is commonly employed , for the reason that it is regarded as a theoretical lower bound for the variance of any unbiased estimation and is usually easy to calculate . based on a wideband signal model ,",
    "the crlbs of time delay and doppler - stretch were derived , under the assumption that the scattering coefficient of the target was known a priori @xcite .",
    "derivation for a more realistic case was performed by @xcite , where the scattering coefficient was supposed to be unavailable at the receiver .",
    "the estimation problem of an extended target with multiple scatterers was even considered in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the crlb is only reliable for accurately presenting the estimation performance when it is approached by the corresponding mean square error ( mse ) , i.e. when the estimation is ( asymptotically ) _ efficient _ @xcite . by directly calculating the theoretical mse",
    ", the estimation performance can be straightforwardly revealed .",
    "however , in most cases it is difficult to evaluate the mse in a theoretical manner . among the limited number of related works , the mses of the af - based joint estimation were calculated in @xcite , whereas a correction followed in @xcite .",
    "however , the calculating results are not accurate since too many approximations were made in both works .",
    "all the approaches @xcite were built on a general wideband signal model , which failed to reveal the waveform parameters that influence the estimation performance with any specific signal .",
    "based on the lsf signal model , the crlbs of time delay and doppler - stretch were derived in @xcite , whereas those of the high resolution range ( hrr ) profiles of an extended target were provided by @xcite .",
    "similar range and doppler estimation problems with the ofdm signal were also considered in @xcite . however , performance analysis on the parameter estimation with the rsf signal is quite limited in previous works .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the performance of the af - based joint delay - dppler estimation with the rsf signal . under high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )",
    "assumption , compact expressions of the mses are obtained through a novel and strict derivation .",
    "the mses are shown consistent with their corresponding crlbs , revealing that the af - based estimation is approximately efficient .",
    "as illustrated by the derivations and simulations , three waveform parameters of the rsf signal , namely , the central carrier frequency , the bandwidth covered by the carrier frequencies , and the variance of the frequency shifting codeword mainly influence the estimation performance . in specific , by increasing either the bandwidth for the carrier frequencies or the variance of the frequency shifting codeword the performance of delay estimation can be improved , while better performance of doppler - stretch estimation calls for higher central carrier frequency .",
    "as one of the synthetic wideband signals , the rsf signal only takes up a narrow bandwidth at any time instant , whereas it achieves the similar estimation performance as the ofdm signal does , contributing to a much reduced requirement for the bandwidth of the receiver . the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
