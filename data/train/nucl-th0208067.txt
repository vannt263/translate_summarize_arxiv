    "it is now commonly accepted that different phase transitions may occur in neutron star interiors .",
    "the possibilities of pion and kaon condensate states , and quark matter state were studied by many authors during the last thirty years , see @xcite and refs therein .",
    "it has been argued that these transitions are of first order .",
    "they were described in terms of two spatially separated phases using the maxwell construction .",
    "glendenning raised the question whether mixed phases in systems composed of charged particles exist instead of the configuration described by the maxwell construction @xcite .",
    "in particular , the possibilities of hadron - kaon condensate ( @xmath0 - @xmath5 ) and hadron - quark ( h - q ) mixed phases were discussed .",
    "the existence of such kind of mixed phases in dense neutron star interiors would have important consequences for the equation of state , also affecting neutrino emissivities @xcite , glitch phenomena and @xmath6 modes , cf .",
    "@xcite .    basing on the validity of the gibbs conditions , in particular on the equality of the electron chemical potentials of the phases , refs @xcite further argued that the maxwell construction is _ always _ unstable .",
    "it is due to the inequality of the electron chemical potentials of two phases and , thus , due to a possibility for particles to fall down from the higher energetic levels characterized by the higher electron chemical potential of the one phase to the lower levels of the other phase .",
    "thereby , refs @xcite argued that , if first order phase transitions , such as quark , kaon condensate and pion condensate transitions , indeed , occur in neutron star interiors , the existence of a wide region of the mixed phase is inevitable . on explicit examples of @xmath0 - @xmath5 and h - q phase transitions authors demonstrated the energetic preference of the mixed phase .",
    "however , strictly speaking , such an argumentation is in contradiction to the results of some other works .",
    "it has been recently observed that in some models the gibbs condition of equality of electron chemical potentials of two phases ca nt be fulfilled at all @xcite , whereas conditions for the maxwell construction are fulfilled .",
    "the latter construction is stable in these specific cases .",
    "a critics of the bulk calculations which ignore finite size effects was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to include these effects authors used a relaxation procedure in which they start with an initial guess for the shape of the electric potential in the wigner - seitz cell , solve for the kaon equation of motion to obtain the charged particle profiles , and then recalculate the electric potential using the new profiles .",
    "this is then repeated until convergence .",
    "authors found that with inclusion of inhomogeneity effects the region of the kaon condensate mixed phase is significantly narrowed compared to that obtained using standard gibbs conditions , disregarding finite size effects .",
    "please notice that in order the scheme to be completely self - consistent the electric field , as the new degree of freedom , should obey the own equation of motion , and it enters equations of motions of other fields ( including protons and electrons ) via the gauge shift of the chemical potentials of all charged particles .",
    "all the charged particle densities are affected by the inhomogeneous electric field even in the case , if one artificially suppressed the contribution of the electric field to the charged kaon density .    for small size droplets ,",
    "the problem of the construction of the mixed phase is analogous to that studied somewhat earlier for matter at sub - nuclear densities , cf .",
    "the possibility of the structure , as well as its geometry , are determined by competition between the coulomb energy and the surface energy of droplets .",
    "@xcite applied these ideas to the description of the mixed phase for the h - q phase transition .",
    "the coulomb plus surface energy per droplet of the new phase always has a minimum as a function of the droplet radius . on the one hand",
    ", this radius should be not too small in order for the droplet to have rather large baryon number ( @xmath7 ) , is assumed to be fulfilled .",
    "otherwise quantum effects , like shell effects , may affect the consideration . ] and , on the other hand , it should be not too large ( less than the debye screening length ) in order one could ignore screening effects .",
    "the debye screening length for the quark matter was evaluated as @xmath8fm .",
    "the value of the droplet radius @xmath9 depends on a poorly known surface tension parameter @xmath10 . with a small value of the surface tension @xmath11 mev@xmath12@xmath13",
    "the droplet size was estimated as @xmath14fm and with @xmath15 mev@xmath12@xmath13 , as @xmath16fm @xmath17 .",
    "thereby , it was argued that the mixed phase is not permitted in the latter case .",
    "corrections to the coulomb solutions due to screening effects were not considered , although one could intuitively expect that for such a narrow interval of available values of droplet radii , being of the order of the debye screening length , the screening may significantly affect the results .",
    "also the effect of the inhomogeneity of the field profiles in the strong interaction part of the energy was disregarded .",
    "therefore , further detailed study of the effects of inhomogeneous field profiles , such as screening and surface effects , seems to be of prime importance .",
    "the problem of the construction of the charged density profiles by taking into account screening effects is in some sense analogous to that considered previously in refs @xcite for abnormal pion condensate nuclei .",
    "results can be used also for the description of the charge distributions in strangelets and kaon condensate droplets .",
    "the value of the surface tension is poorly known .",
    "it has the meaning only if there exists a related shortest scale in the problem , being much smaller than the typical scale of the change of the electric field . in the case of the kaon condensate phase transition",
    "there is no necessity to introduce the surface tension .",
    "one can explicitly solve the equations of motion for all the mean meson fields , cf .",
    "refs @xcite .",
    "however one should also include the equation of motion for the electric field .",
    "the existence of the additional typical scale @xmath18 appearing in this equation may affect the solution .",
    "in the case of the h - q phase transition there is a natural minimal scale in the problem related to the confinement @xmath19  fm .",
    "since the latter scale is much shorter than @xmath18 the introduction of the surface tension is well established in the given case .    with this paper",
    "we show that , firstly , the maxwell construction does not contradict the gibbs condition of equality of the electron chemical potentials , if one properly incorporates the electric potential .",
    "secondly , inclusion of finite size effects , such as screening and surface tension , is crucial for understanding the mixed phase existence and its description .",
    "we will consistently incorporate these effects .",
    "part of the results of this paper was announced in the letter @xcite .",
    "our consideration is rather general and main effects do not depend on what the concrete system is studied .",
    "however we need to consider a concrete example to demonstrate the quantitative effects .",
    "for that aim we concentrate on the description of the h - q phase transition .",
    "thus we avoid the discussion of other possibilities , such as the charged pion condensation , charged kaon condensation , see @xcite and refs therein .",
    "we will consider the simplest case of the h - q phase transition between normal phases .",
    "thus we also avoid the consideration of the diquark condensates and diquark condensates together with the pion and kaon condensates , see @xcite and refs therein . with the inclusion of the diquark superfluid gap , the corrections to the effective energy functional",
    "are expected to be as small as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the pairing gap and @xmath22 is the baryon chemical potential , cf .",
    "however the response to the electric field can be a more specific .",
    "e.g. , in the case of the phase transition to the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase the quark sub - system is enforced to be electrically neutral without electrons , cf .",
    "there can be even more involved effects , which we do not consider , like the modification of the quark and gluon condensates with the increase of the baryon density , a modification of masses and widths of all particles , that needs a special quantum treatment , etc .    in sect .",
    "[ gcap ] we critically review the application of the gibbs conditions to the finite size structures and we discuss the stability of the maxwell construction .",

    "here , we will illustrate some inconsistencies of a naive treatment of the gibbs conditions .",
    "these conditions formulated for spatially homogeneous systems were further applied for the description of the maxwell construction and spatially inhomogeneous structures of mixed phase leading to inconsistencies .",
    "let us assume that we deal with a first order phase transition in a neutron star interior between two bulk phases ( i ) and ( ii ) separated by a thin boundary layer . in discussing rather short distance effects one may disregard spatial changes of the fields due to gravity . in order to describe bulk configurations of phases i and ii one usually applies the gibbs conditions @xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 supplemented by the local charge - neutrality relations @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the pressure",
    ", @xmath28 is the baryon chemical potential , @xmath29 is the net charged density of given phase , @xmath30 .",
    "the configuration corresponding to the coexistence of two locally charge - neutral bulk phases is determined by the double tangent construction ( maxwell construction ) .",
    "the straight line @xmath31 connecting the points i and ii on the curve of the density dependence of the energy density @xmath32 ( for temperature @xmath33 ) is characterized by equal derivatives @xmath34 and , thus , the pressure equals in both phases . for phase transitions between two hadron",
    "phases these points relate to the one and the same curve @xmath35 and correspond to the equal area maxwell construction on the @xmath36 plot .",
    "bulk configurations i and ii are separated by a boundary layer , which presence is ignored in the formulation of the above conditions ; e.g. , the charge - neutrality condition ( [ loc - neutr ] ) is obviously violated in this layer .",
    "thus , the boundary layer is assumed to be rather thin as compared to the sizes of regions occupied by both phases .",
    "there are two typical sizes characterizing the boundary layer between phases . in case of hadron - quark transition the shortest scale ( @xmath37 ) is related to the change of nuclear and quark fields in a narrow part of the boundary layer ( we call it the surface layer ) with the length @xmath38  fm and the longest scale ( @xmath39 ) is related to the electric field generated in the boundary electric charged layer of the length @xmath40  fm . only in the case @xmath41 ( @xmath42 be the minimum of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , the spatial change of the energy density in this boundary layer can be treated as a surface contribution ( neglecting corrections of the higher order in @xmath45 ) , being rather small compared to the volume one , since the surface energy is @xmath45 times less than the volume energy .",
    "thus , in case @xmath41 , with an accuracy @xmath46 , one may neglect contributions to thermodynamic quantities of the charged boundary layer and the surface layer between two spatially separated bulk phases , as it is usually done in the standard formulation of the maxwell construction .",
    "the maxwell construction treatment of first order phase transitions has no alternatives for the description of systems with one conserved charge ( baryon charge in our case ) . however , neutron stars are composed of charged particles and the electric charge is also conserved .",
    "imposing the relations ( [ loc - neutr ] ) one assumes that the electric charge is conserved locally , contrary to the other possibility that the electric charge is conserved only globally , see @xcite .",
    "thus , one should still check a new possibility of the formation of a mixed phase constructed of inhomogeneous rather small size charged structures embedded in the charge - neutral wigner - seitz cells .",
    "so , the local charge - neutrality conditions might be relaxed , being replaced by the global charge - neutrality condition @xmath47 relation ( [ global ] ) introduces the fraction volumes @xmath48 of the domain @xmath49 occupied by the phase i and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , of the domain @xmath52 occupied by the phase ii . in the case of spherical geometry one deals with spherical droplets of the one phase",
    "( be phase i ) embedded into the other phase ( be phase ii ) .",
    "this is so called the mixed phase .",
    "the condition of the total baryon number conservation , @xmath53 is also imposed , @xmath54 is the total volume occupied by the phases .",
    "refs @xcite suggested that the conservation of the global electric charge requires an extra gibbs condition for the electron chemical potentials to be fulfilled @xmath55 which is formulated in analogy with relation ( [ onegibbs - b ] ) . at the first glance , condition ( [ muel ] )",
    "contradicts relations ( [ loc - neutr ] ) , which define @xmath56 , as stated in text books .",
    "therefore , refs @xcite argued that the double - tangent ( maxwell ) construction is _ always _",
    "unstable since , due to the inequality of electron chemical potentials , the particles may fall down from the higher energetic level characterized by the larger electron chemical potential ( for concreteness in phase ii ) to the lower one ( in phase i ) .",
    "this argumentation implies the use of the same definitions of chemical potentials in gibbs and maxwell treatments .",
    "now we will show that the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) and the maxwell condition ( [ loc - neutr ] ) do not contradict each other since they use _ different definitions _ of the electron chemical potentials , the global constant quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) according to the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) and the local quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) according to the maxwell construction , eq .",
    "( [ loc - neutr ] ) . briefly speaking",
    ", the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) , as it was formulated for spatially homogeneous configurations , has no meaning in the application to charged systems of a small size , if one does not incorporate electric field effects .",
    "it only fixes the level from which one counts the electric potential .",
    "therefore , the above mentioned argumentation against the maxwell construction is invalid",
    ". it does not take into account effects of the electric field arising in any charged systems , at least , near the boundary .",
    "thus , first , we need to fix the definition of the electric chemical potential of the spatially inhomogeneous system , since we need to recover this quantity for phase i based on the knowledge of the quantities of phase ii .",
    "the two ways how one can do it are illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the first way ( we will call it * way i * ) is as follows .",
    "consider two bulk matters occupied by phases i and ii separated by a boundary layer ( @xmath63 ) , see fig.1 .",
    "the electron chemical potential of the phase i is determined as @xmath64 in agreement with the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) . the value @xmath65 is fixed by the corresponding local charge - neutrality condition , see second eq .",
    "( [ loc - neutr ] ) , i.e. @xmath66",
    ". then , such a gibbs condition contains no further information except an indication that all the electron energy levels in both phases are occupied up to one and the same the top ( if we assume that @xmath67 , where @xmath60 is fixed by the first local charge - neutrality condition , first eq .",
    "( [ loc - neutr ] ) ) energy level @xmath68 .",
    "in order to avoid any contradiction with the local charge - neutrality condition for the phase i ( first eq .",
    "( [ loc - neutr ] ) ) , which would determine the value @xmath69 , one needs to introduce an external electric potential well @xmath70 .",
    "the gradient of the latter is necessarily produced in the charged boundary layer separating the bulk phases .",
    "the value which enters this charge - neutrality condition , second eq .",
    "( [ loc - neutr ] ) , is then @xmath71 . in the opposite case with @xmath72",
    ", the gibbs condition means that levels are counted from the bottom level .",
    "the electric potential well is completely filled by electrons from the bottom to the top according to the pauli principle , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , no instability of such kind arises within the maxwell construction .    in discussion of the possibility and construction of the finite size structures of the mixed phase one also needs to incorporate the electric potential , because the small charged droplets have an inhomogeneous profile of the electric field .",
    "the potential well satisfies the equation of motion , which is the poisson equation , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the electric potential well , @xmath75 is electric charge , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the charge density of the @xmath78 particle species .",
    "@xmath70 is the gauge variant quantity allowing the replacement @xmath79 and , thus , being determined up to an arbitrary constant @xmath80 , see sect .",
    "3 . accordingly",
    ", the chemical potential is also a gauge dependent quantity . here in the * way i * we fixed the gauge taking @xmath81 , @xmath82 ,",
    "1 . then it is related to the electron density @xmath83 by means of @xmath84 . for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the radius of the wigner - seitz cell , with the debye screening lengths @xmath87 determined by the same eq . (",
    "[ el ] ) , there is no difference in solution of ( [ el ] ) for the configuration given by the maxwell construction and for spherical droplets of the mixed phase .",
    "what configuration is realized is determined by the minimization of the appropriate thermodynamic potential over the droplet size .    the second way ( which we will call the * way ii * ) is a quasiclassical treatment also illustrated in fig .",
    "the chemical potential of electrons is introduced as a local quantity , being unambiguously determined by the value of the electric potential well , namely @xmath88 .",
    "here we imposed the boundary condition @xmath89 at large distances from the droplet , if the concentration of droplets @xmath48 is very small .",
    "thus , the gauge constant is taken to be @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the quasiclassical quantity , being expressed via the local concentration of the particles , cf .",
    "@xcite , p. 321 .",
    "it is precisely how the chemical potential is defined in the usual treatment of fermi systems . only in order to distinguish between the local quantity and the global constant used in the * way i * we introduced the subscript `` @xmath93 '' and `` @xmath94 ''",
    "then , the local charge - neutrality conditions automatically yield different values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 in both phases , as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ loc - neutr ] ) , i.e. in complete agreement with the description given by the maxwell construction .",
    "the * way ii * chosen , the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) should be omitted .",
    "one does not need to introduce any additional constants , since the value of the top energy level is already fixed by the condition @xmath97 , as @xmath98 approaches the boundary of the wigner - seitz cell for the case of a tiny concentration @xmath48 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "all the necessary information comes from the poisson equation for the electric potential well , which is _ the equation of motion for the electric field _",
    "properly derived from the lagrangian .",
    "equivalently , this equation of motion can be obtained by minimizing the appropriate thermodynamic potential , being expressed in the corresponding variables .",
    "if @xmath100 , there exist constant solutions of eq .",
    "( [ el ] ) , being valid for each phase outside the boundary layer of the length @xmath101 .",
    "namely , these constant solutions @xmath102 unambiguously guarantee the charge - neutrality conditions ( [ loc - neutr ] ) and , thus , determine the values of the electron chemical potentials of each phase , i.e. @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in the boundary layer the potential @xmath105 or , in other words ,",
    "the electron chemical potential @xmath106 varies from the value @xmath107 to the value @xmath60 .",
    "an argument that the difference in the values of the electron chemical potentials of the two phases produces an instability , since particles may fall down from the higher energy level corresponding to the larger value of @xmath108 to the lower level ( @xmath109 ) , again does not work .",
    "the electric field configuration given by the solution of the equation of motion ( [ el ] ) is completely filled by the charged fermions from the bottom ( @xmath110 ) to the top ( @xmath111 ) in accordance with the pauli principle and there is no one free state anymore , cf .",
    "if a free state would be formed it would be immediately filled by chemical reactions turned out from the equilibrium in this case .    in the case",
    "@xmath112 the first local charge - neutrality condition ( [ loc - neutr ] ) is irrelevant .",
    "the configuration is determined by the corresponding inhomogeneous solution of the poisson equation .",
    "thus , in order to incorporate the possibility of mixed phase structures in the framework of a consistent scheme one needs to explicitly introduce the electric field developing according to its equation of motion .",
    "the equality of the electron chemical potentials of two phases written as @xmath113 would mean that the value of the electric potential well @xmath70 is constant within the volume occupied by the phases .",
    "but _ with constant @xmath70 charged objects ca nt exist ! _",
    "a charged droplet can be formed only , if there is a competition between the electric field energy and the surface energy , that permits the existence of a minimum in the gibbs potential ( or the thermodynamic potential in the corresponding variables ) per droplet at some finite droplet size .",
    "this should be treated as a _ necessary condition for the existence of a mixed phase .",
    "_ on the other hand , according to eq ( [ el ] ) the constancy of the electric potential within some extended space region would mean that the r.h.s . of this equation is zero .",
    "therefore it coincides with the local charge - neutrality condition , see ( [ loc - neutr ] ) , and we come back to the construction with @xmath114 describing the case @xmath115 , as in the maxwell construction , rather than to a construction of droplets of a small size . _ one definitely should exclude condition ( [ muel ] ) in the * way ii * in favor of the solution of the equation of motion ( [ el ] ) , which then unambiguously determines the charged configurations . _    concluding , the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) is automatically satisfied in the * way i * , where the electron chemical potential is constant .",
    "this constant then enters the r.h.s . of ( [ el ] ) . in the * way ii",
    "* the electron chemical potential introduced as @xmath116 is no longer constant and the gibbs condition ( [ muel ] ) should be dropped .",
    "both ways are simply related to each other by the gauge transformation and lead to the very same equations of motion , thus describing the same physics ( see sect .",
    "3 ) .    thus , in the description of mixed phase configurations inhomogeneous electric field profiles should be explicitly found .",
    "also surface effects modify the gibbs condition ( [ onegibbs ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the latter effect in appendix [ surf ] .",
    "we consciously paid so much attention to these questions in order to motivate the necessity of a consistent account of the electric field effects and to remove the so called `` contradiction '' between descriptions of the mixed phase and configurations determined by the maxwell construction being discussed during many years in the literature .",

    "summarizing , in this paper we have discussed the possibility of the presence of structured mixed phases at first order phase transitions in multi - component systems of charged particles . using the thermodynamical potential as the generating functional we have developed a formalism , which allows to explicitly treat electric field effects including the debye screening .",
    "we have studied a `` contradiction '' between the gibbs conditions and the maxwell construction extensively discussed in previous works .",

    "we also evaluated the surface tension between the hadron and the quark phases .",
    "however this evaluation remains rather rough .",
    "an uncertainty in the value of the surface tension does not allow to conclude whether the mixed h - q phase exists or not .",
    "both possibilities , the mixed phase and the maxwell construction , can be studied within different models .",
    "an advantage of our study is that the characteristics of the mixed phase are expressed in terms of only few parameters . thus knowing these parameters for a given model one may apply our results for the discussion of the mixed phase , the maxwell construction , the geometry of the structures , the energy contributions of the structures and the electric field profiles .    in absence of a mixed phase our charged distributions describe the boundary layer between two",

    "@xcite .    concluding",
    ", we would like to do a remark .",
    "as follows from analysis of many works and as was argued above , in the absence of electric field effects typical estimate of @xmath37 is @xmath674  fm .",
    "the same estimate is also used in recent work @xcite studying the first order phase transition from the nuclear matter to the color superconductor within the maxwell construction . on the other hand , figures of refs @xcite which numerically studied the possibility of the mixed phase at the first order phase transition to the kaon condensate phase demonstrate a several fermi scale for all the fields : nucleon , sigma , omega , rho and kaon fields .",
    "there can be two reasons for that .",
    "first , these works discussing inhomogeneous charged structures within mixed phase do not introduce the poisson equation for the electric field , as well as electric field itself , and therefore the region of applicability of their results seems to be not quite clear .",
    "second , the kaon field and the electric field in the region i relate to the same scale @xmath737 , as follows from our analysis of this problem , cf .",
    "analogous problem of supercharged pion - condensate nuclei discussed in ref .",
    "therefore , surface effects related to the scale @xmath37 , being partially smeared by effects related to the larger scales @xmath87 , might be not seen in these numerical evaluations .",
    "contrary , a partial smearing of the fields is incorporated explicitly in our analysis .",
    "indeed , corrections to all the fields due to electric field effects , which we treat explicitly , relate to the scales @xmath87 , as we argue , see eqs .",
    "( [ co ] ) . in case of the h - q phase transition that we discuss in this paper",
    "this smearing can be only partial , since the scale @xmath738 is fixed by the quark confinement and ca nt be substantially changed .",
