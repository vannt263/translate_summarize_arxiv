    "most disordered organic materials are molecular glasses having very low concentration of intrinsic free carriers .",
    "they demonstrate measurable conductivity only after injection of carriers by the action of the laser pulse or strong electric field . at the same time",
    ", organic glasses usually have high concentration of dipoles and quadrupoles . due to almost zero concentration of free carriers and lack of screening such molecules",
    "provide long range contribution to the overall energetic disorder for charge carriers .",
    "long range sources inevitably lead to the strong spatial correlation of the random energy landscape @xmath0 : in organic polar materials ( dipolar glasses ) correlation function of random energy @xmath1 decays as @xmath2 and in nonpolar materials ( quadrupolar glasses ) it decays as @xmath3 @xcite . in this paper",
    "the most attention will be paid to cluster structure of the dipolar glass . using an exact analytic calculation as well as computer simulations",
    "it was shown that in the dipolar glass the random energy @xmath0 is a gaussian random field if the average distance between dipoles is not significantly greater than the minimal distance @xmath4 ( a lattice scale ) @xcite .",
    "long range correlations mean that sites with close values of random energy tend to group together and form clusters ( cluster is defined as a set of connected sites , where all of them have site energy @xmath5 greater than some boundary energy @xmath6 ) .",
    "until recently very little has been known about cluster distribution on size @xmath7 in correlated gaussian medium ( here @xmath8 is the number of sites in a cluster ) .",
    "we suggested an approximate method for the analytic estimation of @xmath7 for `` deep '' clusters with @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is rms disorder and , by definition , @xmath11 ) .",
    "it turns out that a very simple calculation of the distribution of the average value of the correlated gaussian field in finite domain containing @xmath8 sites provides a very accurate estimation of the leading asymptotic for the distribution of large clusters with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we also discuss briefly how the correlated properties of the energetic disorder in dipolar glasses are modified in the vicinity of a conducting electrode .",
    "the simplest domain average is the distribution @xmath14 of the average value @xmath6 of the random energy @xmath0 in a domain with volume @xmath15 ( here we consider a spatial average and use the same notation @xmath6 for the average energy ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 equals @xmath18 inside the domain and @xmath19 outside . for the gaussian random field",
    "this distribution can be calculated in the exact way @xcite @xmath20    for the uncorrelated gaussian field @xmath21 , hence , @xmath22 and does not depend on the shape of the domain . in the opposite case of the very strong spatial correlation , where @xmath23 at the microscopic scale , @xmath24 and again does not depend on the shape of the domain .",
    "this extreme example looks quite unusual but , nonetheless , this is exactly the case for the gaussian random energy landscape provided by the random uncorrelated distribution of static charges if concentrations of charges of the opposite sings are equal @xcite . in that case for the transport layer of the finite thickness @xmath25 the only relevant spatial scale for the correlation function is @xmath25 and @xmath24 for @xmath26 .",
    "we can conclude that the whole variety of the dependences of @xmath27 is bounded by these two limiting cases .",
    "of course , in the typical situation @xmath28 does depend on the shape of the domain , and these extreme cases are exceptional .",
    "the most studied case ( apart from the trivial case of the uncorrelated gaussian field ) is the dipolar glass model , where @xmath29 with @xmath30 @xcite . in that case for the spherical domain with radius @xmath31 @xcite @xmath32 if a domain has an arbitrary shape but still could be characterized by a single linear scale @xmath33 , then @xmath34 just because of dimensionality argument , though the coefficient of proportionality depends on the actual shape of the domain .     in the dipolar glass for @xmath31",
    "equals to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( circles , squares , and crosses , correspondingly ) .",
    "inset shows the plot of the low @xmath38 tails . ]     in the dipolar glass for @xmath31 equals to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( circles , squares , and crosses , correspondingly ) .",
    "inset shows the plot of the low @xmath38 tails . ]",
    "importance of the distribution @xmath14 stems from the fact that it can serve as a good estimation for the number of true clusters if @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , the number of spherical domains @xmath40 per unit volume , having an average energy greater than @xmath6 , is approximately equal to @xmath41{u_0 \\gg \\hskip2pt \\sigma } \\frac { \\sqrt{2k}}{u_0 v^2 \\sqrt{\\pi}}\\hskip2pt \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u_0 ^ 2 v^2}{2k}\\right ) , \\label{erfc}\\ ] ] here the coefficient @xmath42 reflects the number of non - overlapping independent domains in a finite sample .",
    "one may expect that ( [ erfc ] ) gives a reasonable estimation for the number @xmath7 of the true clusters , i.e. domains , where @xmath43 everywhere ( assuming @xmath44 ) , at least for the leading term of the asymptotic dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 ( the very use of the continuous model of the random medium suggests that our consideration is valid only for @xmath45 ) .",
    "in addition , this estimation could be valid only for clusters with @xmath39 , far away from the percolation threshold , because we consider the distribution of the average field in the most compact domain ( a sphere ) . in the vicinity of the percolation threshold clusters",
    "typically have a fractal - like structure @xcite . if this assumption is true , then for the dipolar - like gaussian field @xmath46 we compared ( [ erfc4 ] ) with the simulation data and found that it provides a good approximation for the true cluster numbers ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "in addition , this approach gives a well - known exact asymptotics @xcite for the uncorrelated gaussian field .",
    "distribution of the average field in the domain for the gaussian random field has a gaussian form , irrespectively to the spatial correlation of the gaussian field .",
    "this is not so for the distribution of the average squared field @xmath47 for the uncorrelated gaussian field this distribution , indeed , has a gaussian form for @xmath45 @xmath48 , \\label{def1_2a}\\ ] ] while for the correlated gaussian field this is not so .",
    "for example , for the dipolar glass the distribution is highly asymmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath49 the tail of the distribution approximately follows the law @xmath50 , while for @xmath51 the corresponding law is @xmath52 .",
    "this difference directly follows from the strong spatial correlation of @xmath0 : inner parts of clusters provide contribution to @xmath53 for @xmath54 , while the boundaries between clusters mostly contribute to the tail @xmath55 .",
    "electrostatic nature of the energetic disorder in organic materials has a very nontrivial consequence .",
    "statistical properties of such disorder at the interface with other material may change dramatically without any variation of the spatial or chemical structure of the organic material .",
    "let us consider the interface of organic glass with the metal electrode .",
    "the electrostatic energetic disorder is directly proportional to the disorder in the spatial distribution of electrostatic potential @xmath56 , generated by randomly situated and oriented dipoles or quadrupoles . in organic layers sandwiched between conducting electrodes distribution of @xmath57",
    "must obey a boundary condition at the electrode surface : at this surface the potential should be a constant .",
    "thus , at the electrode surface there is no energetic disorder at all , irrespectively to how disordered is the material in the bulk .",
    "this means that the magnitude of the dipolar or quadrupolar disorder increases while going away from the interface , asymptotically reaching its bulk value @xmath58 .",
    "magnitude of the dipolar disorder at the interface is decreased as ( here @xmath59 is the distance from the interface plane ) @xcite @xmath60 , \\hskip10pt a_0=aa.\\ ] ] asymptotics of the correlation function @xmath61 for @xmath62 can be calculated using the approach , suggested in @xcite @xmath63 here @xmath64 is a 2d vector oriented along the interface plane .",
    "hence , at the interface the dipolar glass is much less correlated in comparison with the bulk : @xmath65 for @xmath66 , while in the bulk @xmath67 , and clusters are elongated perpendicular to the interface .",
    "parameter @xmath28 for a sphere , located at the distance @xmath59 from the interface , can be estimated by a direct generalization of ( [ result ] ) to the case of spatially non - uniform disorder and has a form @xmath68 with @xmath69 @xmath70 here @xmath71 is a bessel function .",
    "magnitude of @xmath28 at the interface is smaller than in the bulk , reflecting the decrease of the spatial correlation .",
    "in this paper we discussed the cluster properties of the electrostatic energetic disorder in organic glasses with the emphasis on the properties of polar materials built by molecules having permanent dipole moments .",
    "we found that for this disorder the distribution of the average energy could serve as a good estimation for the true cluster numbers per lattice site for large `` deep '' clusters , where @xmath45 and the threshold energy @xmath6 is significantly greater than the rms disorder @xmath10 .",
    "comparison of the analytical results for @xmath72 , calculated for a spherical domain , and computer simulation data for @xmath7 supports the hypothesis that @xmath72 provides the exact leading asymptotic term for @xmath7 .",
    "we have also shown that the electrostatic energetic disorder in organic semiconductors changes dramatically in the neighborhood of a metal electrode .",
    "this phenomenon is of principal importance for the description of the charge injection in organic devices .",
