    "metal oxides play a very important role in many areas of chemistry , physics , and materials science [ 1 - 6 ] . the unique characteristics of metal oxides make them a very diverse class of materials , with properties covering almost all aspects of materials science and solid - state physics .",
    "oxidic materials exhibit fascinating electronic and magnetic properties , including metallic , semiconducting , superconducting , or insulating and ferro- , ferri- , or antiferromagnetic behaviors . in technological applications ,",
    "oxides are used in the fabrication of microelectronic circuits @xcite , capacitors @xcite , sensors @xcite , piezoelectric devices @xcite , fuel cells @xcite , semiconductors [ 12,13 ] , oxygen generators @xcite , organic synthetics [ 15 - 19 ] , the manufacture of engineered ceramics @xcite , coatings for the passivation of surfaces against corrosion @xcite and as catalysts as both the support and active component [ 22 - 24 ] . however , nanoscale metal oxides are particularly attractive to both pure and applied researchers because of the great variety of structure and properties , especially those related to intrinsic size - dependent properties [ 11,24 - 27 ] .",
    "+   + tin ( iv ) dioxide ( ii ) @xmath5 is one of the important members of the metal oxide family and has been extensively studied for wide range of applications such as gas sensors , transparent conductive oxides , catalysis , and far - infrared dichromic mirrors .",
    "chemical and thermal stability , natural off stoichiometery , optical transparency and possibility of conductivity variation over a wide range makes @xmath3 suitable for above mentioned applications @xcite .",
    "+   + @xmath3 has only one stable phase , which is known as cassiterite ( mineral form ) or rutile ( crystal structure ) with space group of @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "its unit cell contains six atoms ( two tin and four oxygen ) , in which tin atoms occupy the center of a surrounding core composed of six oxygen atoms placed approximately at the corner of a quasi - regular octahedron ( figure 1 ) .    in case of oxygen atoms ,",
    "three tin atoms surround them , approximately forming an equilateral triangle .",
    "the metal atoms ( @xmath7 cations ) are located at ( 0,0,0 ) and ( @xmath8 ) positions in the unit cell and oxygen atoms ( @xmath9 anions ) at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the internal parameter u takes the value 0.307 .",
    "+   + lattice parameters are * a * = * b * = 0.474 nm and * c * = 0.319 nm .",
    "it is a wide bandgap degenerate semiconductor with a direct band gap of approximately 3.6 ev falling in the ultra - violet region , which is an important feature for many technological applications .",
    "the valence electronic configurations of sn and o atoms are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . therefore , while forming the @xmath3 molecule , the 5s and 5p electrons of the sn atom are partially transferred to two o atoms .",
    "each o atom can accept two electrons in its 2p orbital to form a stable octet .",
    "the energy band structure of @xmath3 thus consists of a 5s conduction band and a 2p valence band separated by a forbidden gap .",
    "+   + in its stoichiometric form @xmath3 acts as an insulator , but in its oxygen - deficient form tin dioxide behaves as an n - type semiconductor .",
    "although the conductivity is thought to be due to intrinsic defect formation , the exact mechanism is not well understood . the bulk electronic structure has been investigated by a number of authors [ 29 - 33 ] , although the detailed defect electronic structure has not yet been studied .",
    "oxygen deficiency may be caused either by oxygen vacancies or tin interstitials , with reduction of some sn(iv ) ions to sn(ii ) as a possible charge compensation mechanism as suggested by the observation of a sno phase in high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) @xcite and fine structure emissions ascribed to sn(ii ) in photoluminescence spectra @xcite .",
    "electronic conductivity could then occur due to the mobility of electrons from sn(ii ) to sn(iv ) sites [ 36 , 37 ] .",
    "+   + experimental data suggests that the cause of the nonstoichiometry in @xmath3 is oxygen vacancies rather than tin interstitials .",
    "the measurement of conductivity as a function of @xmath14 partial pressure has shown results consistent with the oxygen vacancy model [ 38 , 39 ] .",
    "electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) studies have identified a resonance at g = 1.89 associated with singly ionized oxygen vacancies ( @xmath15 in krger - vink notation ) [ 40 - 42 ] .",
    "this resonance occurs after co / ar treatment of @xmath3 , which results in the formation of @xmath15 through the interaction of co with surface oxygen to form @xmath16 and neutral oxygen vacancies by the defect reaction @xmath17 .",
    "this forms a paramagnetic defect through the defect reaction @xmath18 , producing an electron in the conduction band of sn 5s character as evidenced in epr by a resonance at g = 1.99 assigned to an unpaired electron on tin @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is thought to transfer electrons onto tin ions to form @xmath19 through the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "shallow donor levels for @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been identified 0.03 and 0.15 ev below the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , respectively ( see figure 2 ) [ 38,44 ] .",
    "+   + as these states lie quite close to the cbm , they will not cause a loss of transparency but will enhance the conductivity by introducing carrier electrons into the conduction band .",
    "further evidence for the existence of these shallow states comes from cathodoluminescence studies which identified a band at 1.94 ev to result from a transition between a surface oxygen vacancy level at 1.4 ev above the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and a bulk shallow donor level at 0.15 ev below the cbm @xcite .",

    "thermal oxidation of metallic tin powder can be expressed simply by the following reactions : + @xmath24 @xmath25 in second step the as synthesized @xmath3 powder was converted into form of pellets . for this we employed the",
    "most widely used technique i.e. dry pressing , which consists of filling a die with powder and pressing at @xmath26 into a compacted disc shape . in this way several cylindrical pellets of 2 mm thickness and 10 mm in diameter were prepared .",
