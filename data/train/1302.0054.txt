    "the ejecta in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) are usually metal - rich , and thus their x - ray spectra often show abundant emission lines of heavy elements ( e.g. , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca and fe ; see vink 2012 ) .",

    "we also proposed that the ratio of the equivalent width ( ew ) of the cr emission line to that of fe ( @xmath0 ) could be used as a valid criterion for sn classification .",
    "however , the sample ( of four snrs ) is small in size and is based on a single mission ( i.e. _ chandra _ ) .",

    "( 2000 ) suggested a type ia origin based on the relative abundance of mg , s , ar , ca , fe and ni to s. badenes et al .",
    "( 2008b ) suggested that if one assumes a type ia explosion mechanism for w49b , its mn / cr ratio could imply a metalicity of @xmath125 for its progenitor .",
    "its @xmath4 ratio of @xmath81.8% derived here suggests either a core - collapse origin or a sn ia of delayed - detonation explosion .",
    "woosley et al .  ( 1995 ) found that the more massive a progenitor is , the more amount of cr will be produced . assuming w49b to be of core - collapse origin",
    ", we would expect a much larger progenitor mass for w49b compared to that of cas a , as the ew of the cr emission line ( often considered as a valid representation of the cr abundance ) of w49b is ten times that of cas a. if one assumes a sn ia origin , its @xmath4 ratio ( of @xmath81.8% ) implies a relatively large deflagration - detonation transition density , @xmath126 .",
    "finally , we note that the above discussions are based on the overall mass ratio of cr to fe in snrs .",
    "the x - ray emission from young snrs is however prominent only above the reverse shock , [ e.g. , in tycho , warren et al .",
    "( 2005 ) assumed that the fe - k@xmath3 emission originates from the inner most position of the shocked ejecta and located the reverse shock at its inner edge ; in cas a , gotthelf et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and helder & vink ( 2008 ) placed the reverse shock at the location where a sharp rise in x - ray emissivity with increasing radius occurs ] .",
    "as discussed in  3 and  4.1 of y09 , cr and fe are in similar ionization states and well mixed , so the observed @xmath4 ratio should be a good indicator of the overall mass ratio of cr to fe for the remnant as a whole .",
    "therefore , our conclusion should be reliable no matter where the reverse shock is and how much ejecta have been overtaken .",
    "we perform a _ suzaku _ x - ray spectroscopic analysis of the cr , mn and fe - k emission lines in young snrs . the principal results of this work are the following :    1 .",
    "the detection of the cr and/or mn lines are reported , for the first time , in 3c397 and 0519 - 69.0 , and confirmed in kepler , w49b , n103b and cas a. 2 .",
    "the line parameters ( i.e. , the centroid energy , flux and equivalent width ) are derived for these six sources .",
    "we perform a correlation analysis between the line center energies of cr , mn and fe - k for these six sources together with tycho and g344.7 - 0.1 of which the cr , mn and fe - k line parameters are available in the literature .",
    "we find a positive correlation between the cr and fe - k line center energies , as found previously in y09 based on _ chandra _ data of four snrs .",
    "such a positive correlation is also found between the cr and mn - k line centroids .",
    "this supports the common origin of cr , mn and fe in the sn nucleosynthesis , and suggests that they are spatially co - located .",
    "the ew ratio of cr - to - fe ( @xmath4 ) , a good representation of the cr - to - fe mass ratio ( @xmath105 ) of the snr , provides useful constraints on its progenitor and the sn explosion mechanism .",
    "for tycho ( type ia ) , 0519 - 69.0 ( type ia ) and cas a ( core - collapse ) , the derived ew ratios @xmath4 are consistent with their classification .",
    "the large @xmath4 ratios derived for n103b , g344.7 - 0.1 and 3c397 suggest a type ia sn explosion as their origins . for the putative type ia snrs kepler",
    ", its small @xmath4 ratio suggests either a carbon deflagration explosion or a core - collapse origin ( which needs to be further explored ) . for w49b",
    ", its @xmath4 ratio suggests that either it is of core - collpase origin with a very massive progenitor , or it is of type ia origin with a relatively large detonation - deflagration transition density .",
