    "in type - ii superconductors one often observes@xcite a peak effect ( or fishtail effect ) in the critical current density measured as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath2 at a fixed temperature @xmath3 or as a function of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath2 . in conventional low-@xmath1 materials",
    "this peak effect mainly occurs at magnetic fields @xmath2 near the upper critical field @xmath4.@xcite in the high-@xmath1 @xmath5 crystals , the line of the maximum critical current density , @xmath6 , frequently lies essentially below the irreversibility line in the @xmath0 plane,@xcite and in sufficiently perfect crystals it exhibits _ nonmonotonic _ behavior with temperature.@xcite in these perfect crystals the line of maximum current density approaches the flux - line melting line , @xmath7 , approximately at the so - called upper critical point@xcite at which the melting line terminates .",
    "when the oxygen deficiency @xmath8 in @xmath9 increases or the crystal becomes less perfect , the end point tends to the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 at zero magnetic field , while @xmath6 becomes a monotonically decreasing function.@xcite it is also important to note that at a fixed oxygen concentration the fishtail effect can disappear in pure ybacuo crystals if the distribution of the oxygen vacancies over the sample becomes uniform.@xcite    at present the origin of the peak effect in low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 superconductors is commonly associated with the proliferation of dislocations in the flux - line lattice .",
    "@xcite at this first order phase transition@xcite induced by quenched disorder in the vortex system , a transformation of a quasiordered bragg glass @xcite into a disordered amorphous vortex phase occurs .",
    "although different criteria@xcite are used for determining the exact position of this transition on the peak - shaped dependence of the critical current density on @xmath2 , they all lead to qualitatively similar @xmath0 phase diagrams , and , for definiteness only , we shall imply below that the phase transition corresponds to the line of the maximum critical current density , @xmath6 .",
    "a description of this order  disorder phase transition in high-@xmath1 superconductors was proposed in refs .   using the lindemann criterion .",
    "it was implied in these papers that the nature of the order  disorder phase transition is different from the vortex lattice melting transition , but at the critical point both phase transition lines merge .",
    "recently it was refined@xcite that the upper critical point does not generally coincide with the point where the order  disorder line reaches the melting curve , and thus the melting line has a portion beyond the intersection point .",
    "however , the following should be noted : the results of refs .   for the disorder ",
    "induced transition were obtained in the regime of single vortex pinning@xcite when the larkin pinning length @xmath10 is less than @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spacing between flux lines , @xmath13 is the flux quantum , and @xmath14 is the anisotropy of the superconductor ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the london penetration depths in the @xmath17 plane and along the @xmath18 axis , respectively ) .",
    "when @xmath3 increases , the length @xmath10 should exceed @xmath19 at some temperature which lies on the boundary of the single vortex pinning regime . at higher temperatures",
    "the disorder was completely neglected in refs .  , and only the melting line of the ideal lattice was derived .",
    "thus , the behavior of the order  disorder line was not actually investigated in the high temperature region , and its connection with the melting line was not established . besides this",
    ", it has remained unclear why the proliferation of dislocations in the vortex lattice of high-@xmath1 and low-@xmath1 superconductors leads to different phase diagrams .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the order  disorder transition line in the high temperature region and _ obtain _ the point where the vortex lattice melting and the order  disorder transition lines merge .",
    "it turns out that for a given model of the vortex pinning , the resulting @xmath0 phase diagram is determined only by the ginzburg number @xmath20 , which characterizes the thermal fluctuations , and by a parameter@xcite @xmath21 that describes the strength of the quenched disorder in the flux - line lattice at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the depairing current density and @xmath24 is the critical current density in the single vortex pinning regime ; both are in the @xmath17 plane ) . for different values of these parameters ,",
    "phase diagrams are obtained which are similar to those observed in experiments for low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "thus , the results of this paper provide a unified approach for analyzing @xmath0 phase diagrams of various superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we consider only magnetic fields exceeding considerably the lower critical field @xmath25 and thus disregard the reentrant behavior of the melting transition and do not distinguish between the magnetic field @xmath2 and the magnetic induction @xmath26 . besides this",
    ", we deal only with anisotropic three - dimensional superconductors , neglecting completely the decoupling of the superconducting layers .",
    "we also assume that @xmath27 is directed along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "this assumption simplifies the analysis of the problem , though our final eqs .",

    "displacements generated by the dislocations facilitate a better adjustment of the vortex lattice to the quenched disorder .",

    "this immediately follows from the fact that the ratio of @xmath62 to @xmath63 [ i.e. , @xmath64 is a function of @xmath57 .",
    "finally , since @xmath65 at @xmath11,@xcite one more form of the lindemann criterion exists : @xmath66 it is just this form that was used in refs .  .",
    "strictly speaking , the values of the constants @xmath58 and @xmath61 may depend on whether the order  disorder transition occurs in the single vortex pinning region or in the region of bundle pinning .",
    "however , to understand the essence of the matter , we shall use the simplest approximation : @xmath61 will be considered as the same constant for the various regimes of pinning .",
    "as well - known,@xcite thermal fluctuations of the flux - line lattice lead to a smoothing of the pinning potential and thereby affect the pinning .",
    "this thermal depinning is especially important for high-@xmath1 superconductors .",

    "10 ) is determined by the pinning mechanism and by the temperature dependences of @xmath71 and @xmath199 , see appendix a.",
    "it is important to emphasize that for given @xmath144 eqs .",
    "( 19)-(25 ) depend only on _ two _ parameters : the strength of quenched disorder , @xmath225 , and the strength of the thermal fluctuations , @xmath20 . in this sense , the equations and figures of sec .",
    "iii correspond to the limiting case @xmath226 .",
    "we consider now new features of the phase diagram which appear in the real situation of finite @xmath20 .",
    "an example of the phase diagram in the case @xmath136 is shown in fig .",
    "note that the order  disorder line terminates at some temperature @xmath227 .",
    "this termination is associated with an increase of the thermal fluctuations and thus with an enhanced smoothing of the pinning potential when the order  disorder line approaches @xmath151 .",
    "interestingly , the end point lies near the so - called depinning line@xcite where @xmath228 .",
    "another new feature of the phase diagram is the intersection of the melting and the order  disorder lines .",
    "thus , we obtain the point where both lines merge .",
    "it is seen from fig .  4 that at this point the position of the critical current peak begins to shift sharply downward from the melting curve , in agreement with the experimental data.@xcite hence , as was mentioned in sec .",
    "iii c , the upper critical point for the melting is likely to occur somewhere nearby .",
    "the portion of the order  disorder line lying above the melting curve has no physical meaning since the density of dislocations in the liquid phase is already higher than in the disordered solid phase.@xcite note also that the rise of @xmath138 at @xmath89 becomes considerably steeper than in the case @xmath229 .",
    "the intersection of the order  disorder line with the melting curve occurs also for @xmath145 . in this case , when @xmath20 increases , the decrease of @xmath81 with @xmath3 diminishes , and eventually @xmath81 becomes an increasing function of @xmath185 , see fig .",
    "5 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath230 ( this value is typical for @xmath5 crystals ) , the temperature behavior of the order  disorder line is similar to that obtained for @xmath136 , and the phase diagrams in both these cases are of the same type .    in fig",
    "5 we also show the upper region of single vortex pinning .",
    "it is important to note that the intersection point of the order  disorder line and the melting line occurs clearly _ before _ the melting curve enters this region , and so at the intersection point the transverse collective pinning length @xmath92 and the positional correlation length @xmath48 ( the dislocation spacing ) both considerably exceed the flux - line spacing @xmath49 .",
    "this fact justifies the assumed weak influence of quenched disorder on the vortex lattice melting and the application of eq .",
    "( 24 ) up to the intersection point .",
    "if the parameter @xmath141 increases , e.g. , as a result of irradiation or of reduction of the oxygen content in @xmath231 crystals ( see appendix a ) , then the order  disorder line shifts down , while the temperature of the intersection point ( and thus the temperature of the upper critical point for the melting line ) increases , fig .  6 .",
    "these results are in agreement with the experimental findings@xcite for @xmath9 crystals . however , although the obtained results qualitatively describe the phase diagram of these crystals and its evolution with varying @xmath141 , it should be emphasized that the intersection point does not reach @xmath1 at reasonable values of the disorder parameter @xmath141 .",
    "consider now the case when @xmath144 increases with @xmath185 .",
    "this situation occurs in the model of @xmath143 pinning , see appendix a. the appropriate phase diagrams are presented in figs .",
    "it is important to note the following : at sufficiently strong disorder , the line @xmath138 monotonically decreases with temperature and practically reaches @xmath1 .",
    "when the strength of the disorder decreases , the order  disorder line exhibits nonmonotonic behavior with @xmath185 , and the temperature of the intersection point , @xmath232 , goes down .",
    "thus , in contrast to the case of a decreasing function @xmath144 , the model of @xmath143 pinning correctly reproduces all the features of the experimental data for @xmath9 crystals.@xcite in particular , the results presented in fig .",
    "8 closely resemble the development of the order  disorder line with variations of the oxygen deficiency @xmath8 , see , e.g. , fig .  9 in ref .  .",
    "the results of this section may also provide an explanation of the findings obtained in ref .  .",
    "it was shown in this paper that the flux - line pinning in pure @xmath231 crystals is mainly due to a nonuniform distribution of oxygen vacancies over the sample .",
    "changing the conditions of annealing of the sample , erb et al",
    ". changed this distribution at a fixed @xmath8 .",
    "when the distribution became more homogeneous , the fishtail effect disappeared .",
    "since the spatial fluctuations in the density of oxygen vacancies strengthen the @xmath143 pinning , we get an additional confirmation of the hypothesis that this type of pinning plays the main role in not too perfect @xmath5 crystals , and so the fishtail effect exists up to high temperatures , as shown in figs .  7 , 8 for large @xmath141 .",
    "when , after annealing , the crystal becomes more perfect , and the above - mentioned spatial fluctuations are reduced , the value of the parameter @xmath141 appears to decrease considerably .",
    "( moreover , it is conceivable that some other type of pinning begins to dominate . )",
    "thus , we arrive at the situation when a fishtail effect is absent , at least in the region of not too high magnetic fields , as it follows from the data shown in figs",
    ".  6 and 8 for small @xmath141 .    finally , we briefly describe the case of small ginzburg numbers which occurs for conventional superconductors . in this case",
    "the temperatures @xmath191 and @xmath232 are practically equal to unity , the melting line almost coincides with @xmath204 , and the phase diagrams tend to those shown in figs .",
    "thus , the results of the simplified approach of sec .",
    "iii can be well applied to such superconductors .",
    "we now present analytical results which give some insight into the origin of the above - mentioned features of the phase diagrams .",
    "let us start with the melting line .",

    "( 25 ) yields : @xmath244 where @xmath245 .",
    "in fact , this is the well - known result@xcite for clean superconductors , @xmath246 note that for eq .",
    "( 27 ) to hold in a sufficiently wide temperature region , the ginzburg number should not be too small . finally , we point out an interesting feature of eq .",
    "( 25 ) that follows from our numerical analysis . the formula @xmath247 with some constants @xmath248 and @xmath249 turns out to give a very good fit to @xmath250 determined by eq .",

    "the values of the parameters @xmath248 and @xmath249 depend on @xmath20 , and the exponent @xmath249 increases with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath252 when @xmath253 . in this connection",
    "it is worth noting that formulas of the type of eq .",
    "( 28 ) are widely used to approximate experimental data , and frequently an exponent @xmath254 is found , which is characteristic for the fluctuation region of a 3d @xmath255-type phase transition .",
    "we emphasize here that a good fit by such formulas does not necessarily mean the existence of a large fluctuation region in zero magnetic field , but may result from the specific form of the expression [ eq .",
    "( 25 ) ] describing the melting line .    in the case of @xmath143 pinning",
    "the melting line may lie inside the region of single vortex pinning , i.e.  the inequality @xmath256 may hold .",
    "this occurs if the parameter @xmath257 ( see ref .",
    ", p.  1218 ) , @xmath258 is sufficiently large , @xmath259 .",
    "although in this case the shape of the melting line requires a special investigation and is not discussed in detail here , it should be realized that the sharp melting transition may disappear in this region .",
    "let us now analyze eq .",

    "( 9 ) [ including the change of the function @xmath186 according to eq .",

    "note that , according to the estimates of @xmath20 and @xmath141 presented in ref .",
    ", such a situation must take place in pure crystals of 2h - nbse@xmath289 , which were investigated in numerous papers .",
    "this conclusion does not contradict the observation of a peak effect in these crystals,@xcite since a peak effect can signalize not only the order  disorder transition , as it has been implied so far , but also the vortex lattice melting.@xcite of course , the features of the peak effect may differ in these two cases .    in the opposite limit , @xmath290 , the order  disorder transition reaches @xmath1 , while the region of `` pure '' melting ( @xmath291 ) is contracted .",
    "this limit just corresponds to conventional superconductors for which @xmath292 , see figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "however , in the process of approaching this limit , the evolution of the phase diagram is different for the different models of pinning , i.e. , in the cases of eqs .",
    "( a13 ) and ( a14 ) .",

    "( a13 ) is valid , one finds from eq .",
    "( 32 ) that @xmath293 thus , a large @xmath257 is required for the temperature @xmath232 to reach unity , see fig .",

    "let us now discuss the upper critical point on the vortex lattice melting curve.@xcite in principle , two scenarios are possible .",
    "in the first one@xcite the upper critical point does not coincide with the intersection point of the melting and the order  disorder lines and is located at a higher magnetic field than this intersection point .",
    "in fact , in this case the intersection of the _ two different _ phase transition lines occurs , and one of them ( the order  disorder line ) terminates at the intersection while the other one continues for some distance which seems to depend on the detailed position of the lines in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "this scenario is based on the difference in the density of dislocations , @xmath296 , generated at the melting and the order  disorder transition : at the melting one has @xmath297 , while at the order  disorder transition @xmath298 .",
    "the position of the upper critical point on the melting line is determined by the condition that the density of dislocations in the disordered vortex solid phase reaches a value typical for the liquid ( i.e. , the dislocation spacing @xmath48 calculated on the melting curve reduces to the vortex spacing @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is this scenario that is assumed in our paper .    in the second scenario",
    "the upper critical point coincides with the intersection point . in this case",
    "the above - mentioned point is ordinary rather than singular for the free energy of the vortex system , since a continuous phase transition separating the disordered vortex solid phase from the vortex liquid does not seem to exist.@xcite thus , there is only _ one _ phase transition line which describes both the melting and the order  disorder transitions .",
    "this unified line originates from the melting curve of clean superconductors , gradually evolving from it as the strength of the quenched disorder increases .",
    "the `` upper critical point '' is then simply the point where on the melting line @xmath48 reduces to @xmath49 and the line experiences a bend .",
    "however , for this scenario to occur , the calculated intersection point must lie in the single vortex pinning region .",
    "otherwise , one obtains @xmath299 at this point and returns to the first scenario .",
    "our results argue in favor of the first scenario since _ in the framework of the used approximations _ the intersection points never reach the upper region of single vortex pinning ( see , e.g. , fig .  5 ) .",
    "note that this scenario is also supported by recent numerical simulations.@xcite",
    "in this paper , using the lindemann criterion and results of the collective pinning theory,@xcite we have derived equations ( 19)-(25 ) which enable one to calculate the order  disorder transition line @xmath138 with account of both pinning - caused and thermal fluctuations in the whole temperature interval of its existence .",
    "the boundaries of the single vortex pinning region , @xmath163 , @xmath300 , and the melting line @xmath250 are also found from these equations .",
