    "the error floor problem of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes under iterative decoding is now a well - known problem , where the codes suffer from an abrupt degradation in their error - rate performance in spite of having good minimum distance .",
    "the problem has been attributed to the presence of harmful configurations generically termed as _ trapping sets _",
    "@xcite present in the tanner graph , which cause the iterative decoder to fail for some low - noise configurations , thereby reducing its guaranteed error correction capability to an extent that is far from the limits of maximum likelihood decoding .",
    "more importantly for the bsc , the slope of the error floor is governed by the guaranteed correction capability @xcite .",
    "recently , a new class of finite alphabet iterative decoders ( faids ) that have a much lower complexity than the bp decoder , were proposed for ldpc codes on the bsc @xcite @xcite and were shown to be capable of outperforming bp in the error floor .",
    "numerical results on several column - weight three codes showed that there exist 7-level faids requiring only 3 bits of precision that can achieve a better guaranteed error correction ability than bp , thereby surpassing it in the error floor region .",
    "however , analyzing these decoders for providing performance guarantees proved to be difficult .",
    "more recently , decimation - enhanced faids @xcite were proposed for bsc in order to make faids more amenable to analysis while maintaining their good performance .",
    "the technique of decimation involves guessing the values of certain bits , and fixing them to these values while continuing to estimate the remaining bits ( see @xcite for references ) . in @xcite , the decimation was carried out by the faid based on messages passed for some iterations , and a decimation scheme was provided such that a 7-level dfaid matched the good performance of the original 7-level faid while being analyzable at the same time .    in this paper",
    ", we show how decimation can be used adaptively to further increase the guaranteed error correction capability of faids .",
    "the adaptive scheme has only marginally increased complexity , but can significantly improve the error - rate performance compared to the faids .",
    "we specifically focus on decoders that propagate only 3-bit messages and column - weight three codes since these enable simple implementations and thus have high practical value .",
    "we also provide some analysis of the decoders which suggests that the failures are linked to stopping sets of the code .",
    "numerical results are also provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme .",
