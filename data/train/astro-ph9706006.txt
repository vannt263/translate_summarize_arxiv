    "the taurus molecular cloud ( tmc ) is one of the best targets to study low - mass star formation , since it is located at a distance of only 140 pc .",
    "the region is associated with t tauri stars , identified by infrared and optical observations ( e.g. strom et al .",
    "@xcite ; kenyon et al .",
    "@xcite ; weintraub @xcite ) , low - luminosity objects extracted from the iras point source catalogue ( psc , iras @xcite ) , molecular outflows ( e.g. fukui @xcite ; fukui et al .",
    "@xcite ) and water maser sources ( wouterloot et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating ongoing star formation .",
    "the tmc contains several dark molecular clouds of size @xmath7 1 pc and densities of 10@xmath8 @xmath1 ( e.g. walmsley et al .",
    "@xcite ; wouterloot & habing @xcite ; ungerechts & thaddeus @xcite ; mizuno et al .",
    "these in turn contain dense molecular cores , high density ( @xmath9 10@xmath0 @xmath1 ) substructures which have been classified by myers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and myers & benson ( @xcite ) . for the sky distribution of the molecular cores in the tmc ,",
    "see kenyon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent multimolecular observations ( e.g. benson & myers @xcite ; fuller @xcite ; fuller & myers @xcite ) have confirmed that dense cores are smaller than 0.1 pc with masses ranging from 0.5 to 10 solar masses and kinetic temperatures of the order of 10 k. beichman et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that about 50% of the molecular cores are associated with iras sources , indicating that these objects may contain , in their interiors , young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "therefore , it is now clear that there exists a close association between low - mass ysos and molecular clumps .",
    "since the tmc is not strongly affected by the nearby cas - tau ob association ( blaauw @xcite ) , it is clear that it provides unique opportunities to study spontaneous low - mass star formation and , in particular , to investigate the nature of the earliest stages of low - mass star formation , strictly connected with dense molecular clumps .",
    "following the definition given by myers & benson ( @xcite ; i.e. sources with @xmath10 @xmath9 0.4 k at the haystack and green bank antennas ) , 16 dense molecular cores have so far been identified in the tmc ( myers & benson @xcite ; benson & myers @xcite ) . in order to obtain a more complete sample of tmc cores , to gain information about the nature of the molecular gas before or at the onset of yso formation and to clarify the evolutionary stages connected with the collapse process",
    ", we report observations of the ( @xmath11 ) = ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines and the cyanodiacetylene ( hc@xmath4n ) j=98 rotational line towards 4 newly discovered dense cores .",
    "the molecular cores chosen for this project have been selected from an extensive search for ammonia emission towards 26 high visual extinction regions in the tmc identified from the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) maps and from myers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed positions are located within 04@xmath12 15@xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 05@xmath12 00@xmath13 and + 16@xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath17 @xmath14 + 30@xmath16 : 9 regions in the long filament which includes tmc-2 ( kutner s cloud ) , 7 regions in the parallel filament to the north , containing b217 ( see fig . 1 of walmsley et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and 10 isolated optically obscured regions where no extended clouds were seen on the poss plates . for the survey , the haystack ( usa ) 37-m and the green bank ( usa ) nrao",
    "43-m antennas have been used with fwhp ( full width half power ) beam sizes of 84@xmath18 and beam efficiencies of about 0.25 during several runs in 1983 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the regions where line emission was searched for . for the non - detections the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath10 value is reported .",
    "ammonia emission has been detected towards 9 sources .",
    "out of these 9 , 5 can be classified as dense molecular cores : l1521d , l1521f , l1524 , l1535 and l1507a . since l1535 has already been investigated by ungerechts et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we have focused our attention on the other four cores , which have been mapped in nh@xmath19 , using the 100-m mpifr radio - telescope at effelsberg ( germany ) .",
    ".regions investigated through nh@xmath19 observations [ cols=\">,>,>,^ , < \" , ]     star formation occurs most readily in molecular clumps in which the internal motions are sufficiently reduced to allow the occurrence of gravitational collapse .",
    "table 6 shows that the thermal energy is always larger than the turbulent one .",
    "the values of @xmath15 for the four cores lie between 0.2 ( l1521d ) and 1.2 ( l1524 ) ; @xmath15 = 1 implies gravitational equilibrium in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the values obtained here are only slightly different from unity . taking into account the contribution of a magnetic field to the energetic support against gravitational collapse , considering also uncertainties in the assumed [ nh@xmath19]/[h@xmath21 value and deviations from the adopted ( spherical ) geometry of the cores",
    ", we can conclude that the four ammonia cores are close to equilibrium .",
    "these considerations are in agreement with the results of myers & goodman ( @xcite ) and harju et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who found that the cores in the tmc are approximately virialized .",
    "an estimate of the total hc@xmath4n column density ( @xmath22 ; @xmath6 ) has been derived through the standard equation ( e.g. olano et al .",
    "@xcite ) , using the molecular parameters given , e.g. , by alexander et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and churchwell et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "table 4 lists the derived cyanodiacetylene column densities at the ammonia peak positions of the four molecular cores : the values range from 1.6 10@xmath5 to 9.2 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , in agreement with the @xmath22 values of other molecular cores located in the tmc ( benson & myers @xcite ) .    in order to estimate",
    "the hc@xmath4n abundances a comparison between hc@xmath4n and nh@xmath19 column densities has been made .",
    "we presently do not know the size and geometry of the hc@xmath4n distribution in the ammonia cores .",
    "however , the hc@xmath4n and nh@xmath19 maps given by benson & myers ( @xcite ) show that the size and shape of the maps are similar and that the peak positions differ significantly only for the tmc-1 molecular core .",
    "therefore , we have estimated the [ hc@xmath4n]/[h@xmath21 ratio using the cyanodiacetylene and ammonia column densities and the nh@xmath19 abundance .",
    "the obtained [ hc@xmath4n]/[nh@xmath19 ] values are : 8.3 10@xmath23 ( l1521d ) , 4.6 10@xmath23 ( l1521f ) , 2.7 10@xmath23 ( l1524 ) and 10.7 10@xmath23 ( l1507a ) .",
    "thus , the derived hc@xmath4n abundances relative to h@xmath24 are : 8.3 10@xmath25 ( l1521d ) , 4.6 10@xmath25 ( l1521f ) , 2.7 10@xmath25 ( l1524 ) and 1.1 10@xmath26 ( l1507a ) , in agreement with the suggestion of benson & myers ( @xcite ) , that relative cyanodiacetylene abundances in dense cool cores vary from @xmath7 10@xmath25 to @xmath7 10@xmath26 .",
    "we have discovered 4 dense cores ( l1521d , l1521f , l1524 and l1507a ) in the tmc , increasing the number of known such objects to 20 in this prototypical dark cloud complex .",
    "the main results of our study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the ammonia observations reveal clumps with sizes of 0.06 - 0.09 pc and yield kinetic temperatures between 7.9 and 9.9 k. the actual intrinsic linewidths are between 0.17 and 0.27 km s@xmath27 , while the thermal linewidths are around 0.15 km s@xmath27 . therefore , the non - thermal velocity component is rather small .",
    "the ratio between the intrinsic and thermal linewidth is about 1.3 , indicating that only low - mass stars can eventually form in these cores .",
    "this is also supported by the association of two of the cores with low luminosity iras counterparts ( @xmath28 @xmath29 10 @xmath30 ) .",
    "the data show that the measured ( 1,1 ) excitation temperatures are only slightly smaller than the rotational temperatures suggesting that the ( 1,1 ) inversion transition is close to being thermalised . from the peak emission hydrogen densities ( between 0.6 and 19.9 10@xmath31 @xmath1 )",
    "have been estimated .",
    "moreover , from the average of all observed positions inside the fwhp contour of the ammonia cores , the core masses ( 0.2  1.0 @xmath32 ) have been estimated .",
    "the derived hydrogen densities show no remarkable difference between cores with or without iras counterparts .",
    "the low @xmath3 values place the four objects towards the edge of the @xmath3 distribution for ammonia cores in the tmc , which ranges from fractions to few tens of solar masses , with a median value of 4 @xmath32 .",
    "estimates of the turbulent , thermal and gravitational energy have been derived .",
    "the thermal energy is always larger than the turbulent one .",
    "the four cores may be close to equilibrium .",
    "emission at 24.0 ghz , caused by the j=98 transition of hc@xmath4n , has been detected towards the ammonia peak positions of the four molecular cores .",
    "this increases the number of known such objects from 11 to 15 in the tmc ( cf . benson & myers 1980 , 1983 ) .",
    "the derived hc@xmath4n column densities range between 1.6 10@xmath5 and 9.2 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , in agreement with results of previous hc@xmath4n observations in the tmc .",
