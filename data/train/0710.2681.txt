    "then for a generic perturbation of their product we have @xmath211 = \\sum_{j\\geq 1 } \\left(\\vphantom{\\sum}[\\sigma^1 { f_{j-1 } } ] \\times { \\mbox{\\rm{id}}}_j^ * [ \\sigma^1 { g_{(-j ) } } ] + { \\mbox{\\rm{id}}}_j^ * [ \\sigma^1 { f_{(-j ) } } ] \\times [ \\sigma^1 { g_{j-1}}]\\right)\\ ] ]      now we have to take a closer look at @xmath214 .",
    "if @xmath215 would be equal to the codimension of @xmath20 then this characteristic class would just represent the singular locus of @xmath20 .",
    "when this is not the case , we have to find an appropriate replacement of @xmath20 that has the right codimension , whose normal bundle however is stably equivalent to that of @xmath20 .",
    "this replacement map is exactly @xmath216 .",
    "indeed , @xmath217 so @xmath218 which in turn is equal to @xmath219 $ ] since this map has the right codimension .",
    "the argument is just slightly more complicated in the case of @xmath220 . here",
    "first we take the map @xmath221 .",
    "this has codimension @xmath222 so @xmath223 = w_{k_2-j+1}(\\nu_{g_{(-j)}})$ ] .",
    "the only problem is that this class lives in the cohomology of @xmath224 .",
    "this is why we have to pull it back to @xmath225 by @xmath226 .",
    "since the composition of @xmath227 and @xmath228 is just a perturbation of @xmath103 and @xmath229 it follows that @xmath230 .",
    "a very similar result can be proved about the @xmath3 stratum of oriented maps .",
    "first we need to compute the thom polynomial of the @xmath3 stratum in the oriented case .",
    "we will work with rational coefficients .",
    "let @xmath19 be a generic map where @xmath231 .",
    "then the rational cohomology class dual to the closure of the set of @xmath3-points of @xmath20 ( for short @xmath232 $ ] ) equals @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the @xmath235 pontrjagin class .    by definition",
    "the thom polynomial @xmath236 of the @xmath3-stratum is a cohomology class in @xmath237 $ ] .",
    "we want to show that @xmath238 .",
    "it is enough to show that these two cohomology classes evaluated on any homology class in @xmath239 are equal .",
    "it is enough to consider a sufficiently large finite dimensional approximation @xmath243 . by the pontrjagin - thom construction",
    "an embedding @xmath244 gives a map @xmath245 that maps @xmath242 into @xmath246 and the restriction @xmath247 corresponds to the normal bundle of @xmath242 .",
    "the homotopy class @xmath248 \\in \\pi_k(mso(k-4t))$ ] is mapped by the composition of the hurewicz homomorphism and the thom isomorphism into a homology class @xmath249 ) \\in h_{4t}(bso(k-4t))$ ] .",
    "hence this class @xmath250 is represented by a normal map .",
    "since the hurewicz homomorphism in stable dimensions @xmath251 is a rational isomorphism , we obtain the statement of the lemma .",
    "to evaluate a @xmath241 dimensional cohomology class on a @xmath241 dimensional homology class represented by a manifold , one just pulls back the cohomology class to the manifold and evaluates it on the fundamental class .",
    "now it is enough to prove , that for every oriented @xmath252 the map @xmath253 induced by the normal mapping @xmath254 takes @xmath255 and @xmath236 to the same cohomology class in @xmath256 . as @xmath257 and @xmath258 is the dual of the @xmath3 stratum of a generic map @xmath259 we reduced the problem of finding the thom polynomial to the special case of @xmath259 maps .",
    "if we take an immersion @xmath260 , and project it to two non - parallel hyperplanes , then we get a map @xmath261 .",
    "let us denote the two hyperplanes @xmath262 .",
    "the projection of @xmath20 to @xmath263 shall be called @xmath264 .",
    "it is obvious that those and only those points belong to @xmath265 which belong to @xmath266 and @xmath267 at the same time .",
    "this means that for this @xmath268 we have @xmath269 = [ \\sigma^1 f_1 ] \\cup [ \\sigma^1 f_2]$ ] .",
    "the two cohomology classes on the right are both equal to the thom polynomial of the @xmath7 singularity , which is the euler class of the normal bundle of @xmath20 .",
    "as this normal bundle has rank @xmath270 , the square of its euler class is equal to @xmath233 , which is the same as @xmath271 .",
    "so far we have proved our claim for those maps @xmath259 where the source manifold can be immersed into @xmath272 .",
    "let us recall that by @xmath273 we denoted the cobordism group of oriented immersions from @xmath241 dimensional manifolds to @xmath272 .",
    "there is the natural forgetting map @xmath274 taking an immersion to its underlying manifold .",
    "to finish the proof of the theorem it is sufficient to show , that this map is a rational epimorphism . according to the pontrjagin - thom construction and the stable hurewicz homomorphism @xmath275 and @xmath276 where @xmath277 means isomorphic if tensored with @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath278 being epimorphic is equivalent to @xmath279 being epimorphic , which is further equivalent to ( by taking the dual morphism in cohomology ) @xmath280 being monomorphic .",
    "we can apply the thom - isomorphism to further reduce the problem to showing that @xmath281 is monomorphic .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath282 is induced by the natural inclusion map @xmath283 .",
    "the cohomology ring of @xmath284 is the polynomial ring @xmath285 $ ] generated by the pontrjagin classes and the euler class , whose square is @xmath255 . on the other hand",
    "@xmath286 $ ] . as @xmath282 takes each pontrjagin class to the same pontrjagin class",
    ", we get that @xmath282 is indeed injective in dimension @xmath241 .",
    "this completes the proof of @xmath238 .",
    "when we want to consider direct products of maps , we will need the cartan formula .",
    "for pontrjagin classes the cartan formula only holds mod 2 , so we will need to consider everything in @xmath287 to get rid of the 2-torsion .",
