    "<S> when nematic liquid crystals are embedded in random polymer networks , the disordered environment disrupts the long - range order , producing a glassy state . </S>",
    "<S> if an electric field is applied , it induces large and fairly temperature - independent orientational order . to understand the experiments , we simulate a liquid crystal in a disordered polymer network , visualize the domain structure , and calculate the response to a field . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using an imry - ma - like approach we predict the domain size and estimate the field - induced order . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations and analytic results agree with each other , and suggest how the materials can be optimized for electro - optic applications .    over the last twenty years , liquid crystals in random environments have been studied as model systems for statistical mechanics under quenched disorder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experiments have investigated liquid crystals confined to disordered polymer networks , aerogels , aerosils , and porous glasses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies have shown that the quenched randomness of the environment provides a crucial disordering influence , beyond the randomness arising from thermal fluctuations , which can induce a glassy state all the way down to zero temperature  @xcite . in this body of work , </S>",
    "<S> one issue that has generally _ not _ been considered is the susceptibility of the glassy liquid - crystal state to a symmetry - breaking field . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to point out that the susceptibility is an important scientific issue , which is also related to applications in electro - optic technology . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the susceptibility as a function of temperature and material properties , and show the parameters that must be optimized for applications .    for applications , </S>",
    "<S> many investigators have developed liquid - crystal displays and other electro - optic devices based on the kerr effect , in which an electric field applied to an optically isotropic material induces orientational order and hence optical birefringence . </S>",
    "<S> this technology requires a kerr coefficient that is large and approximately independent of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> one approach to achieve this goal is by using liquid - crystal blue phases  @xcite , complex configurations of double - twist cylinders threaded by disclination lines  @xcite . although blue phases are locally anisotropic , the anisotropy averages out on longer length scales , leading to zero birefringence . </S>",
    "<S> however , when an electric field @xmath0 is applied , it favors alignment of the molecules with respect to the field direction , thus inducing globally averaged orientational order and birefringence proportional to @xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main limitation of this approach is that blue phases are normally stable over only a very narrow temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason , substantial effort is being devoted to chemical synthesis  @xcite and polymer stabilization  @xcite of blue phase materials .    as an alternative to blue phases , yang and yang </S>",
    "<S> have suggested using a nematic liquid crystal trapped within a disordered polymer network  @xcite . on short </S>",
    "<S> length scales the nematic phase has orientational order , but on long length scales the polymer disrupts the order , producing a glassy state with local nematic domains . </S>",
    "<S> yang and yang refer to the resulting structure as a `` polymer - stabilized isotropic phase , '' but it could equally well be called a `` polymer - disordered nematic . '' when an electric field is applied to this phase , it induces long - range orientational order of the local nematic domains , and hence the material becomes birefringent . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason , the material can function just as a blue phase , with a large kerr effect , but without the need to stabilize it over a significant temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it offers an excellent opportunity for electro - optic applications .        in this paper , we develop a model for the susceptibility of a polymer - disordered nematic phase to an applied electric field , using monte carlo simulations and an imry - ma - like domain argument . for monte carlo simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the system is modeled by a two dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice of unit vectors , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sim_temp](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> each polymer is represented by a fixed chain of lattice sites , while the remaining sites represent liquid crystal molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the orientations of the polymer sites are fixed at the beginning of the simulation , and remain unchanged to mimic the effect of polymers that induce local random orientations on the neighboring liquid crystals , whose orientations are free to change in the monte carlo process . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is @xmath2 here , the first term represents the interaction between neighboring liquid - crystal molecules at sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with strength @xmath5 proportional to the frank elastic constant . </S>",
    "<S> the second term represents the interaction between a liquid - crystal molecule at site @xmath3 and polymer unit at adjacent site @xmath4 , with anchoring strength @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the third term is the effect of the applied electric field on the liquid crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate this hamiltonian using the metropolis algorithm to visualize the director configuration and determine the orientational order as a function of temperature and applied field .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_sim_temp ] shows snapshots of the system . in the simulation , </S>",
    "<S> the system begins in a disordered state at high temperature , and undergoes a transition to a nematic state as the temperature is lowered . in the low - temperature final state , it consists of uniform domains of different director orientations , which form due to the competition between elastic energy favoring alignment ( @xmath5 term ) and the quenched disorder favoring randomness ( @xmath6 term ) . </S>",
    "<S> if there were no polymer , the system would form one domain of uniform orientation .    to characterize the size of the domains , we measure correlations between director orientations . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the correlation function @xmath7 as a function of distance , as shown in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sim_cor_length_vs_temp ] inset for various temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the results are fit to the exponential @xmath8 to obtain the correlation length @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_sim_cor_length_vs_temp ] shows the simulation data for correlation length as a function of temperature for various anchoring strengths ; fits are discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we apply an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_sim_temp](b ) shows snapshots of the director configurations for weak and strong electric fields , respectively . for a sufficiently strong field , </S>",
    "<S> all the liquid - crystal domains become fully aligned with the direction of the applied field . for weaker fields , </S>",
    "<S> the domains are not fully aligned , but still have some net order along the field direction . to quantify the orientational order , we anneal the system to the desired temperature , then run at that temperature to calculate the tensor order parameter @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the average is taken over _ both _ sites and monte carlo steps . the positive eigenvalue of that average tensor yields the scalar order parameter @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the electric field , wait for the system to equilibrate , and measure the order parameter again . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the order parameter on applied electric field is shown by the data points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sim_kerr_const_vs_temp ] , right inset .    to analyze the simulation results for @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to fit the data to a function and extract a parameter to characterize how sensitively the order responds to the field . to construct a fitting function </S>",
    "<S> , we suppose that each domain responds as a single unit to the applied field , with all spins in the domain at an angle @xmath16 relative to the field direction . </S>",
    "<S> the effective free energy of the domain should be @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution for @xmath16 then becomes @xmath18 , and the average order parameter becomes @xmath19 we can now fit the functional form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s_prediction ] ) to the simulation results for @xmath15 , treating @xmath11 as an arbitrary fitting parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the fits are shown by the solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sim_kerr_const_vs_temp ] , right inset . </S>",
    "<S> they are fairly good , although certainly not perfect , because the domain argument is only an approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the fits , we can take the parameter @xmath11 as our measure of the response of the material to the electric field , which can be compared with the experimental kerr constant . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional experimental definition of the kerr constant @xmath20 is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the induced optical birefringence and @xmath23 the optical wavelength  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the optical birefringence is related to the orientational order parameter by @xmath24 . by comparison , for a small field our functional form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s_prediction ] ) reduces to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional kerr constant is therefore @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath11 provides the statistical mechanical information in the conventional kerr constant , but not the optical information of @xmath27 and @xmath23 . for convenience </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to @xmath11 as the kerr constant for the rest of this paper .     on temperature for various anchoring strengths . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ s_prediction]).,width=324 ]    figure  [ fig_sim_kerr_const_vs_temp ] shows the parameter @xmath11 as a function of temperature for various anchoring strengths . </S>",
    "<S> this kerr constant increases as the temperature is reduced . for low </S>",
    "<S> anchoring the dependence on temperature is quite strong , but for high anchoring the dependence is much weaker . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior must arise from the competition among two ordering influences ( frank elastic energy and electric field ) and two disordering influences ( anchoring to quenched polymer disorder and thermal fluctuations ) . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is to understand how @xmath11 depends on these competing influences , and how it is related to the correlation length shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sim_cor_length_vs_temp ] .    to understand the simulation results for the kerr constant , we develop an approximate theory for the susceptibility of a liquid crystal embedded in a random polymer network to an applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we build on earlier work on cooperative chiral order in random copolymers  @xcite , in which there is a pseudoscalar order parameter defined along a 1d chain . </S>",
    "<S> randomness arises from quenched disorder in the sequence of right- and left - handed chemical groups , as well as from thermal fluctuations , and a net order parameter is induced by a slight population difference between the right- and left - handed groups . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have a tensor order parameter defined on a 2d lattice ( in the simulations ) or 3d fluid ( in the experiments ) . </S>",
    "<S> randomness arises again from both quenched disorder and thermal fluctuations , and a net order parameter is induced by a slight electric field .    </S>",
    "<S> following the example of that polymer problem , we consider the issues in three steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , we analyze the behavior of the system at zero temperature and zero applied field , with quenched disorder competing with the elastic energy . in that case </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the characteristic domain size or correlation length @xmath9 as a function of anchoring strength @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we investigate the response of domains of size @xmath9 to the symmetry - breaking field , and determine the kerr constant @xmath11 as a function of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> third , we add thermal fluctuations and see how they reduce the order compared with quenched disorder only .    </S>",
    "<S> one complication in our simulation is that the quenched randomness is concentrated on specific sites corresponding to the polymer network . as an approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we map the model onto a system in which there is a random field on every site , as in a random - field magnetic system  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this approximation should be especially reasonable if each domain contains many polymers , i.  e.  if the domain size is much greater than the typical polymer spacing . at each point of space </S>",
    "<S> we have a liquid - crystal director @xmath28 ( in continuum notation ) or @xmath29 ( in the discretized approach ) , and a local random field @xmath30 or @xmath31 . </S>",

    "<S> the system consists of domains , with uniform orientation inside each domain and negligible correlations among different domains ( see fig .  [ fig_sim_temp](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the typical domain size @xmath9 using the classic imry - ma argument  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> domains form when the elastic energy ( favoring large domains ) is comparable to the random - field energy ( favoring small domains ) . in spatial dimension </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 , with a continuous ( not ising ) order parameter , the elastic energy scales as @xmath40 , while the random - field energy scales as @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> equating these energies gives a prediction for the domain size @xmath42 note that this domain size is large when the random fields are small , and decreases as the random fields increase .    at this point </S>",
