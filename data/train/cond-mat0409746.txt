    "the process of breaking solids into smaller pieces has been the subject of deep thoughts since the time of the greeks , who tried to understand the building blocks of matter .",
    "not going so far away in time or neither in the area of particle physics , the fragmentation process is still an important problem to study since it is a main issue in current problems in our day - to - day life .",
    "for instance , to understand why or how a material breaks is relevant in the development of new technological devices or in geological problems @xcite . because it is such a significant issue , a large number of experiments in fragmentation have been performed in order to collect data of fractures in many types of materials and objects forms @xcite .",
    "the number of theoretical articles on this topic is no smaller .",
    "the main focus of recent studies in this field is based on molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , where the results show an ubiquitous scaling behavior in the distribution of the mass fragments , @xmath5 , with the exponent @xmath4 depending on the dimensionality and initial parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the mass distribution belongs to the same universality class for large enough input energies when the md system breaks into smaller pieces @xcite . however , using a molecular dynamics approach ching et al .",
    "@xcite fragmented an object represented as a set of particles interacting via    the lennard - jones potential with the fracture process being induced by    random initial velocities assigned to the particles .",
    "the resulting steady - state form found for the cumulative mass distribution displays a typical power - law region , with a non - universal exponent that increases with the total initial energy given to the system .",
    "the same behavior has been observed in experimental fragmentation of long glass rods @xcite and duly interpreted as an indication that the fragmentation process is not a self - organizing phenomenon , contrary to the assumption of oddershede et al .",
    "@xcite s in contrast to the self - organized criticality paradigm where the power law behavior should appear without a control parameter , there is a interesting claim that , in impact fragmentation , criticality could be tuned at a nonzero impact energy @xcite . in this way , the fragment - size distribution should satisfy a scaling form similar to that of the cluster - size distribution of percolation clusters @xcite , but belonging to another universality class @xcite . from the results of such numerical models",
    "it has been suggested that there exists a critical imparted energy , below which the object to be fragmented is only damaged , and above which it breaks down into numerous smaller pieces .",
    "the transition between the _ damaged _ to the _ fragmented _ states behaves as a critical point , with the fragment size distribution displaying a scaling form similar to that described in percolation theory @xcite .",
    "the same dependence on the impact energy for the fragmented state has been found very recently in another numerical model for the fragmentation of a circular disk by projectiles @xcite as well as in the experimental fragmentation of shells @xcite .    in the present work",
    "our aim is to investigate through molecular dynamics simulations the effect of different initial conditions ( e.g. , temperature and impact energy ) on the mass distribution of fragments generated after an `` explosion '' takes place .",
    "one of our goals is to show that the scaling behavior observed in the statistics of mass fragments is non - universal and that this non - universality has a direct correspondence with the state of the system prior to fragmentation process . in section",
    "ii we describe the details of the model and simulations .",
    "the results are shown in section iii , while the conclusions and some perspectives are presented in section iv .",
    "the fragmentation model used here is based on the one described in refs .",
    "the initial state of the object to be fragmented is a thermalized configuration generated through a standard molecular dynamics simulation in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the particles interact with each other through a 6 - 12 lennard - jones pair potential and the system is brought to the desired equilibrium temperature by integration of newton s equations of motion @xcite . a neighbor - list method is applied and periodic boundary conditions are used in all directions .",
    "this allows us to simulate up to @xmath6 particles for a single realization of the fragmentation system .",
    "the results are then taken from an average of fifty realizations ( the direction of the initial velocities for the particles are different for each sample ) for a given set of initial conditions , as defined by the value of the temperature , particle density , and energy given to break the md system apart .",
    "this `` explosion energy '' is specified through the parameter @xmath7 , defined as the ratio between the initial kinetic energy and the initial potential energy of the particle , immediately after the velocities are set according to the equation below @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the initial velocities and @xmath10 are the initial positions of the particles , obtained in the thermalization stage .",
    "the second term in the above equation is responsible for an expansion process that is preceded by an explosive event .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath11 has units of inverse of time and gives a measure of the initial energy imparted to the object . from time",
    "zero onward , no energy is added to the system and the particles positions and velocities are now calculated considering free boundary conditions . as a result ,",
    "the system expands and the particles are distributed among clusters ( fragments ) of different masses . each particle is considered as a monomeric cluster with unitary mass .",
    "there are several definitions for a particle cluster @xcite . here",
    ", two particles will belong to the same cluster if they are separated by a distance smaller than an arbitrary cutoff , @xmath12 .",
    "the fragments are then classified according to their mass @xmath1 and counted to enable the calculation of the distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , both normalized here by the total number of fragments .     for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and two different values of temperature @xmath17 ( circles ) and @xmath18 ( squares ) . for comparison",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath19}$ ] .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding mass distribution @xmath13 , with the solid line representing the best fit.,width=283 ]",
    "due to the fluctuations in @xmath13 , it is usually more convenient to work with the cumulative form of the mass distribution defined as @xcite    @xmath20    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the behavior of @xmath14 for fixed values of the system density @xmath15 and the parameter @xmath16 , and two different values of the temperature @xmath21 .",
    "as can be seen , both distributions display a region of power - law behavior at intermediate values of @xmath1 followed by a typical cutoff due to finite size . from ref .",
    "@xcite , the following expression has been proposed to describe the behavior of @xmath14 :    @xmath22 } , \\label{fit}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is a scaling exponent , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are cutoff parameters . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the application of a standard non - linear estimation algorithm to both data sets shows that eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) fits well the scaling region for intermediate masses as well as the decaying cutoff for large fragment sizes , which is compatible with a stretched exponential behavior .",
    "this fitting procedure gives estimates for the scaling exponent that are substantially different , namely , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "there is however a discrepancy between the data and the curve fitted with eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) at @xmath25 for the region of small fragments .",
    "this can be readily explained in terms of the large `` evaporation '' rates at high values of the temperature  an expected effect that is responsible for the progressive detachment of small clusters from the hull of large and medium fragments after the explosion event .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the corresponding behavior of the distribution @xmath26 for both values of @xmath21 is also consistent with scaling ansatz eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , when the parameter used are the same as those obtained for fitting its integral form @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the profiles of the distribution @xmath14 for several values of the temperature in the range @xmath27 and a fixed value of @xmath15 . when observed in detail ,",
    "the diversity in shape of @xmath14 for intermediate and large fragment sizes indicate that the fragmentation process must be restricted to a discrete and much smaller number of different classes of behavior than the variation with an entire spectrum of thermalization temperatures could suggest .",
    "this fact is quantitatively verified when we observe that , after fitting eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) to each data set , the scaling parameter @xmath4 can assume one among only three distinct numerical values for the distributions generated at nine different temperatures . in fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the variation of the cutoff parameter @xmath2 with temperature for @xmath15 .",
    "as the temperature increases from @xmath17 , @xmath2 remains approximately constant up to @xmath28 , where it suddenly drops to become again constant , at least up to the maximum value of the temperature we use in our simulations , @xmath25 .",
    "this sharp transition in @xmath2 indicates the existence of a `` critical '' temperature below which a large cluster ( i.e. , with a size of the order of the system size ) can exist .     for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and different values of temperature.,width=283 ]     against temperature .",
    "the values of density and the parameter @xmath7 are the same as in the previous figure.,width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the data collapse obtained by rescaling the abscissas @xmath1 of each curve shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] to its corresponding estimate of the cutoff parameter @xmath2 , as well as rescaling the values @xmath14 to @xmath29 .",
    "this results clearly reveal the presence of only three groups of distributions , each one with a characteristic value for the scaling exponent @xmath4 .",
    "such a behavior can be explained with the help of the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the points following the vertical dashed line represent the values of temperature used in our simulations . from this diagram",
    ", we readily deduce that the threefold statistics of mass fragments shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is a direct consequence of the three distinct phases to which the thermalized objects belonged before they have been broken apart .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the collapses are rather convincing for intermediate and large fragment sizes , the apparent divergence characterizing the statistics of small fragments due to `` evaporation '' appears to be continuously changing with temperature within each of the three groups of collapsed data .     shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the collapse has been obtained by rescaling the abscissas @xmath1 of each distribution to its corresponding cutoff parameters @xmath2 , as well as rescaling the values @xmath14 to @xmath29.,width=283 ]        the situation becomes entirely different when we analyze the influence of the energy parameter @xmath7 on the statistics of the fragmentation process . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the distributions @xmath14 computed for md systems thermalized with temperature @xmath17 , particle density @xmath15 , and for different values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . from the non - linear fitting of eq .",
    "[ fit ] to each data set we notice that , while the scaling exponent remains approximately constant at @xmath40 , @xmath2 changes significantly with @xmath7 .",
    "precisely , as shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] , the decay of @xmath2 with @xmath7 can be described in terms of a power - law @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a prefactor and the exponent @xmath43 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is an offset that is related to the competition between the thermal energy of motion and the energy that holds the system together , i.e. , the ratio between the kinetic energy and the potential energy just before the velocities are settled according to eq .

    "the boundary is lifted .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ m0 ] and its estimated parameters to rescale the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that the distributions for all values of @xmath7 can be nicely represented by a single data - collapsed curve .",
    "of course , this should only be valid for systems subjected to the same thermalization process , i.e. , if @xmath45 and @xmath21 are kept constant .     for values of",
    "the energy parameter @xmath7 ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath39 .",
    "the md systems have been thermalized with @xmath17 and @xmath15,width=283 ]     against the energy difference @xmath46 for md systems thermalized with @xmath47 and @xmath17.,width=283 ]",
    "in summary , we performed an extensive study of a two - dimensional fragmentation process through molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "specifically , we have shown how the statistics of the fragmentation process depends on ( _ i _ ) the thermalization temperature of the system before its breakdown , and ( _ ii _ ) the energy imparted to the system to induce fragmentation . in the first case , we verified that the cumulative mass distribution follows a power law for intermediate masses , with an exponent that depends on the region of temperature considered .",
    "more precisely , we showed that it is the phase of the thermalized object that is responsible for the difference in these scaling exponents .",
    "it means that the process studied here can be rather sensitive to the previous state of the system , although it introduces a significant disturbance from an energetic point of view . as a consequence",
    ", fragmentation carries memory . finally , we turned our attention to the variation of the parameter @xmath7 . differently to the previous case , we obtained a unique scaling exponent for the cumulative mass distribution for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with previous studies in the literature indicating some sort of universal behavior present in fragmentation processes @xcite ."
