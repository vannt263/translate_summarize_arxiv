    "my viewpoint comes from a bottom - up approach  @xcite to modeling quasicrystal structure and explaining their thermodynamic stabilisation .",
    "that is , we start with ab - initio or pair potential based evaluation of the total energy , to capture the t=0 behaviour ; or perhaps md ( molecular dynamics ) and mc ( monte carlo ) simulation for @xmath0 . we inductively identify motifs and restrict our model , so it has freedom to explore only the states we know are comparatively good .",
    "[ at this level , the model may be formulated in terms of tilings or clusters , but the discrete geometry is just standing in as a way to label the distinct low - energy atomic configurations . ]",
    "new simulations are constructed , which can handle larger length scales because there are fewer degrees of freedom . at the moment , this appears to be the most direct approach to acertain whether energetic stabilisation ( e.g. an implementation of penrose s matching rules ) is ever relevant to real quasicrystals .      in a metal",
    ", realistic pair potentials have friedel oscillations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : potcluster](a ) ] .",
    "i will review why this is the real - space analog of the ` hume - rothery ' ( and related ) mechanisms in reciprocal space .",
    "the energy from second - order perturbation theory , computed in reciprocal space , is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the free electron dispersion , and @xmath3 is the [ short ranged ] potential for an atom to scatter an electron . [",
    "the factor of 2 is from electron spin ; i do not encumber this schematic formula with multiple atomic species .",
    "] so @xmath4 is most negative when @xmath5 , the atom density at a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath6 , is strong for @xmath7 ( near to spanning the fermi sphere ) : that was hume - rothery s criterion . if we now do the sum over @xmath8 in ( [ eq : e2 ] ) , lumping the prefactors and calling it ` @xmath9 ' , we get @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the atoms positions ; the second equality just comes from fourier transforming , [ recall @xmath12 . ]",
    "the effective interatomic potential @xmath13 turns out to be the electron susceptibility @xmath14 , convolved twice with @xmath15 in three dimensions . now",
    "the sharp fermi surface in reciprocal space induces friedel oscillations in real space  a factor @xmath16 in @xmath14  which are inherited by @xmath13 .",
    "thus , hume - rothery stabilisation is practically equivalent to saying the second minimum in @xmath13 is essential for determining the structure .",
    "at least , friedel oscillations are important in the al - tm family [ i(alpdmn ) , d(alnico ) ] and in the frank - kasper family [ i(znmgre ) ] . in this conference ,",
    "mihalkovi and widom  @xcite assert that the embedded - atom potentials [ which lack friedel oscillations , but implicitly include multi - atom interactions ] work excellently for the i(cdca ) family .    as a result",
    ", the sites within a ` cluster ' are not governed by interactions with the other atoms in the cluster , but are a resultant of overlapping spheres representing the potential wells of second and third neighbour atoms , including those outside the cluster .",
    "this seemed to me the only explanation for the pseudo mackay cluster in e.g. @xmath17-alcufe .",
    "[ the outer shells have icosahedral symmetry , but the innermost one has a roughly 1/3 filling of 20 sites on 3-fold axes , where one geometrically would have expected an icosahedron ] .",
    "the al atoms have rather weak interactions , and sometimes seem to behave almost like a fluid moving around a framework of fixed and well - ordered tm atoms",
    ". simulations by cockayne and widom  @xcite , henley _ et al _",
    "@xcite , and hocker and ghler  @xcite found frequent hoppings of the al atoms , so that one wonders whether to speak of well - defined sites .",
    "the configurational entropy from this is obviously huge .",
    "simulational approaches have scarcely scratched the surface as far as addressing thermally excited disorder , but i would say we know what to do .",
    "the reason it has not been tried is that a thorough ab - initio - based study of a good quasicrystal has been carried out just a handful of times so far , and it is much simpler to do it at @xmath18 .",
    "the simulation experiences have led me to believe that in the known quasicrystals , clusters do not have physical reality ( in the sense of having significantly stronger intra - cluster bonding ) .",
    "yet clusters ( or tiles , which i consider to be a closely related concept ) are inescapable as a framework to organise our understanding of a structure .",
    "a lesson we learned from more fundamental fields of 20th - century physics is that we all need frameworks to organise our thinking , but we forget that it is a coordinate system we impose to decribe phenomena , not a physical reality .",
    "we should not be seduced by our tools and ascribe fundamental significance to these mental constructs .",
    "let us instead be open to ` complementarity ' : that is , dissimilar descriptions may secretly be equivalent .",
    "our experiences with decagonal structure models  @xcite offer abundant examples in which the _ same _ structure may be expressed in terms of cluster @xmath19 on network @xmath20 , or of cluster @xmath21 on network @xmath22 . perhaps cluster @xmath21 is related to @xmath19 by some sort of inflation ; or perhaps @xmath21 is associated with the voids in the packing of @xmath19 and vice versa .",
    "( an example is the complementarity of bergman clusters and mackay clusters in icosahedral quasicrystals . )    in a great many models , the cluster is a mathematical corollary of a set of inequalities which express the energy minimisation .",
    "this appears most baldly , perhaps , in abstract tiling models where one demands to maximise the frequency of occurrence of cluster @xmath23 @xcite  one presumably would say that cluster @xmath23 does have a physical content in this model .",
    "but in many cases , this optimisation forces the presence of a much larger supertiling , and much larger clusters @xmath19 appear at its vertices .",
    "thus , the appearance of the cluster is dependent on things that happen far away : a slight change in e.g. stoichiometry , and the clusters which dominated the whole image may dissolve in favour of some other motif , as a consequence of delicately competing energies .",
    "a second way in which the cluster configuration depends on faraway atoms can be seen in al - tm quasicrystals , which are well described using pair potentials that have a strong second potential well due to friedel oscillations .",
    "the fact that an atom occurs in a particular site within a cluster is then not mainly due to interactions with its neighbours in the cluster , but is the resultant of potentials from many more distant neighbours in the space surrounding the cluster , and which are sufficiently correlated that the potentials from them add constructively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potcluster](b ) ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "my proposed operational definition of clusters is statistical : ` a pattern of atoms which is found in all examples of a given ensemble . '",
    "an ensemble is implicit in anybody s definition of a cluster : to locate the boundary around a group of atoms , it must be possible to surround the cluster in more than one way ; one could not talk of , e.g. , the fcc lattice as being built from clusters .",
    "the implicit ensemble might be either multiple occurrences of the cluster in a large unit cell , or various crystal phases that contain the same cluster , or a single simulation cell in which one enumerates all the low - energy structures .",
    "one can not rule out a cluster description a priori as a way to map the energy landscape of a structure .",
    "when i was more naive , in fact , i advanced a cluster model which assumed a certain cost of cutting the linkages between mackay clusters along 2-fold and 3-fold symmetry directions , so as to predict the equilibrium crystal shape  @xcite .",
    "although a certain knobbliness might be anticipated , still even if the crevices got filled by al atoms the energy cost might still be a linear function of the cluster - cluster linkages cut by the placement of the interface .",
    "but in view of the experience mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster - deca ] , i no longer expect that cluster linkages govern the energy differences due to offsets or orientations of the interface .",
    "nevertheless , one can imagine ` clusters ' emerging in the purely statistical sense expressed in the ` operational definition ' at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster - deca ] . if a crack approaches similar groupings of atoms , presumably it tends to pass through them in similar fashions .",
    "then the atoms which always find themselves together on the same side of the crack could be designated a ` cluster ' for the purposes of describing crack propagation .",
    "notice that ( i ) such ` clusters ' need not be the same ones that are useful in describing the equilibrium ensemble and ( ii ) one would expect their shape to have less symmetry than the material itself , as it must depend on the orientations of the crack propagation and of the crack shear . if it happens that in fact the _ same _ clusters appear in cracks of various orientations , and for other physically defined ensembles , that would be justification to attribute a ` physical reality ' to the cluster  but such tests seem possible mainly in simulations , not in experiments .",
    "my motivation here is not in the physical consequences of phason elasticity , but in using elasticity as an indicator of the nature of the quasicrystal state . _",
    "gradient - squared _ elastic free energies appear only in the _ random - tiling _ kind of phase , in the sense distinguished in sec .",
    "[ sec : stabilisation ] , above .",
    "matching - rule interactions would lead to an energy cost which is _ linear _ in the absolute value of phason strain components  @xcite , presumably the same is true for any other interaction that has the same ground state ( or to one in the same ` local isomorphism ' class ) .",
    "a small caveat should be offered .",
    "the linear cost is related to the discrete hops that are mathematically unavoidable in structures with the usual quasicrystal space groups  @xcite . on the other hand , for unusual non - symmorphic space groups ,",
    "a ` continuous phason mode ' is possible  @xcite which _ may _ exhibit gradient - squared elasticity in the ground state , in the same sense that one - dimensional incommensurate crystals may . but no plausible atomic model structure of this class has ever been exhibited , much less a set of interactions for which it is the ground state .",
    "the experiments of de boissieu _ et al",
    "_  @xcite on icosahedral phases are the only ones i know that support the validity of elastic theory and thus , implicitly , a random - tiling - like equilibrium state .",
    "but i will not fully trust the elastic interpretation of diffuse scattering till the quantitative elastic constants agree ( at least in order of magnitude ) with a plausible simulation .",
    "that has not happened yet : one reason is that the ` canonical cell ' tiling , which is the simplest way to make a well - specific ensemble for most cluster - based icosahedral models ,  @xcite is also the least tractable tiling to simulate  @xcite ; a second reason is that it is nontrivial to extract an absolute scale of fluctuations from measurements of diffuse scattering .    in the case of _ decagonals , _ no evidence of gradient - squared elasticity has ever been seen in experiments . the behaviour of the entropic elastic theory in decagonal random tiling models is not well understood , either .",
    "thus , it seems more plausible to me that matching rules ( or the equivalent ) are realised in decagonal quasicrystals , than in icosahedral ones .",
    "the two fundamental competing scenarios of the stabilisation of quasicrystals are not exactly ` entropy ' versus ` energy ' , as we often loosely say .",
    "rather , the question is whether the model is in the qualitative class that contains quasiperiodic ideal tilings that have purely bragg peaks , or the class that contains the maximally random tiling in which long range order is an emergent phenomenon .",
    "this distinction is a rigorous one from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics , because these two states are separated by a phase transition , but that is of no help in distinguishing them experimentally .",
    "i have come to believe that ab initio modeling , though tedious on account of the many levels of description between microscopic and macroscopic  @xcite , is the quickest path to a solid understanding of which scenario should apply to a particular given material .",
    "it is sometimes objected that simulation is unfeasible for handling e.g. incommensurate modulations , when the effective repeat cell is far too large to simulate by brute force .",
    "but there are generally ways to bridge to large scales by connecting the simulations first to a kind of continuum model .",
    "( a valid analogy is that one can understand the geometry of a large soap bubble by evaluating its surface tension , which can be computed using a far smaller simulation cell . )    to get meaningful results , it is crucial ( and very difficult ) that the structure used in the modeling be made consistent with the hamiltonian assumed  it must be the ground state ( in the @xmath18 case ) , or nearly so .",
    "rather generally , al - tm quasicrystals seem to have a framework of well - fixed sites plus a scattering of sensitive sites . in @xmath17-almnsi ( and perhaps some others ) , these are the @xmath24 atoms of ref .",
    "@xcite , located on 6d body centres in the hyperspace formulation , or centring bergman clusters in real space , which can alternate between al or tm atoms or vacancies . in @xmath25-alconi ( ni - rich or co - rich ) , there are al atoms in ` channels '  @xcite which undergo ( in simulated models ) intricate occupational / displacive orderings . at a higher level of description , such atomic orderings can be expressed as terms  maybe the dominant terms  in the effective tile - tile interaction ( whether or not it realises matching rules ) .",
    "it was asserted that ` a considerable amount of chemical disorder is essential to a random - packing model .",
    "perhaps this is based on a mistaken picture that random packings ( of clusters ) necessarily create atom conflicts that must be resolved in a context - dependent way .",
    "but actually each _ tile _ in a tiling  whether random or governed by local rules  has a finite set of local environments , and the atom decoration is _ designed _ to fit well with every environment , without overlapping or conflicting atoms .    in the simplest cases",
    " e.g. the square - triangle tiling with dodecagonal symmetry , or the rhombohedral tiling with ico symmetry",
    " there are two kinds of tiles , and the ( irrational ) ratio of their numbers is fixed by the symmetry . the decoration is deterministic , so there is a unique stoichiometry .",
    "however , tilings related to real quasicrystals often have more than two tiles ",
    "e.g. the ` canonical cell tiling '  @xcite with ico symmetry , or the ` hexagon - boat - star ' tiling  @xcite with decagonal symmetry . then within the sum rules fixed by symmetry",
    ", one kind of tile can be traded for a combination of the others ; sometimes the decoration is such that this trade leaves the atom count unchanged  @xcite , so our model is line compound in this case too . in the case that the atom content changed , though",
    ", the alloy composition would indeed be variable ; but as elser once suggested , such a decoration is undesirable since phason dynamics would be coupled to , and slowed by , mass diffusion , contrary to the observed relaxation in good quasicrystals .      note that although it has become attractive to reformulate matching rules in terms of a decoration that implements gummelt - like covering rules  @xcite , i do not think this is likely to emerge from an atomistic model .",
    "if a covering cluster emerges , it will be a sort of accident from the maximimation of some smaller non - overlapping cluster ( see my comments on clusters in sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster - deca ] ) .",
    "instead , i consider it much likelier that something emerges similar in spirit to penrose s arrow rules .",
    "that is : the larger energy scales expressed by the fundamental atomic sites define a random - tiling ensemble ; then additional occupational orderings in relatively rare sites define ( something like ) a set of interacting arrows .",
    "in fact , widom  @xcite and coworkers have found ( in the past few years ) a matching rule _",
    "almost _ equivalent to penrose s , in the decagonal @xmath25(alcuco ) , implemented in that case by an alternation alco / coal in the chemical occupancy of a pair .",
    "the evidence is abundant that many quasicrystals are high - temperature phases , ergo stabilised by entropy  but , in many cases , not the tiling configurational entropy , for that is too small .",
    "so , the larger entropy of vibrations or of chemical disorder is the only candidate to affect the phase diagram . in the past , we brushed aside such entropy contributions , by claiming they must have a similar value in the quasicrystal phase as they do in the approximant phases .",
    "the latter phases were assumed to be the immediate competitors of the quasicrystal phase in the phase diagram , so the difference in vibrational or substitutional free energies would largely cancel .",
    "but perhaps we need to examine more carefully just how the quasicrystal ordering may affect these entropic terms .",
