    "the origin of the intermediate and heavy elements beyond iron has been a long - standing , important question in astronomy and astrophysics . the neutron capture s- and r - processes synthesize the bulk of those nuclei . while low - mass , asymptotic giant branch ( agb , @xmath1 @xmath2 ) and massive stars ( @xmath3 @xmath2 ) were found to contribute to the s - process , the site of the r - process still remains unknown .",
    "moreover , a number of naturally occurring , proton - rich isotopes ( the p - nuclei ) can not be made in either the s- or the r - process .",
    "although their natural abundances are tiny compared to isotopes produced in neutron - capture nucleosynthesis , their production is even more problematic .",
    "the long - time favored process , photodisintegration of material in the o / ne - shell of a massive star during its final core - collapse supernova explosion , fails to produce the required amounts of p - nuclei in several mass ranges .",
    "several alternative sites have been proposed but so far no conclusive evidence has been found to favor one or the other .",
    "further important uncertainties stem from the reaction rates used in the modeling of the thermonuclear burning .",
    "investigations in astrophysical and nuclear models , together with various `` observational '' information ( obtained from stellar spectra , meteoritic specimens , and nuclear experiments ) comprise the pieces which have to be put together to solve the puzzle of the origin of the p - nuclei .",
    "it is an excellent example for the multifaceted , interdisciplinary approaches required to understand nucleosynthesis .",
    "this review attempts to provide a general overview of the conditions required to produce p - nuclei and a summary of the commonly discussed production processes and sites .",
    "it then focusses on the possibilities to better constrain astrophysical models through measurements , from meteoritic isotopic abundances to nuclear experiments .",
    "the derivation of astrophysical reaction rates for intermediate and heavy nuclei from experiments necessitates the use of theoretical models of nuclear reactions , due to the nuclear properties ( such as binding energies and cross sections ) demanding extreme thermonuclear conditions to allow the synthesis of proton - rich nuclides .",
    "we start with a brief historic overview and definition of the p - nuclei in , followed by an overview of the suggested astrophysical processes and sites ( ) , also outlining the problems encountered .",
    "presents the information which can be extracted from the analysis of meteoritic material , from the actual solar p - abundances ( ) to constraints from extinct radionuclides ( ) and isotopic anomalies ( ) .",
    "the discussion of the relevant nuclear physics starts with basic definitions in .",
    "important reactions , the main nuclear uncertainties and the ways in which nuclear experiments can help are examined in sections [ sec : importantreactions ] , [ sec : sensi ] , and [ sec : expgeneral ] .",
    "experimental approaches are reviewed in , more specifically photodisintegration reactions and their limitations ( ) , charged - particle induced reactions ( ) , elastic scattering ( ) , and neutron - induced reactions ( ) .",
    "in the first detailed analysis of solar abundances published by @xcite , it was already indicated that at least two types of processes may be required to produce the abundance distribution above iron , one leading to neutron - rich isotopes and a different one for neutron - deficient nuclides .",
    "only one year later @xcite ( b@xmath4fh ) and @xcite made detailed studies on suitable processes and their constraints , based on the data by @xcite and additional astronomical observations and nuclear data .",
    "it turned out that two types of neutron - capture processes were required to explain the abundance patterns of intermediate and heavy nuclei , the so - called s- and r - processes @xcite .",
    "they also realized that a number of proton - rich isotopes can never be synthesized through sequences of only neutron captures and @xmath5 decays ( ) and required the postulation of a third process .",
    "it was termed _",
    "p - process _ because it was initially thought to proceed via proton captures at high temperature , perhaps even reaching ( partial ) ( p,@xmath0)-(@xmath0,p ) equilibrium .",
    "this nucleosynthesis process was tentatively placed in the h - rich envelope of type ii supernovae by b@xmath4fh but it was later realized that the required temperatures are not attained there @xcite .",
    "this also shed doubts on the feasibility to use proton captures for producing _ all _ of the nuclides missing from the s- and r - process production .",
    "it is somewhat confusing that in the literature the name `` p - process '' is sometimes used for a proton capture process in the spirit of b@xmath4fh but also sometimes taken as a token subsuming whatever production mechanism(s ) is / are found to be responsible for the p - nuclides . for an easier distinction of the production processes , here we prefer to adopt the modern nomenclature focussing on naming the nuclides in question the _ p - nuclides _",
    "( they were called `` excluded isotopes '' by @xcite ) and using different names to specify the processes possibly involved .",
    "historically there were 35 p - nuclides identified ( and ) , with @xmath6se being the lightest and @xmath7hg the heaviest .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that this assignment depends on the state - of - the - art of the s - process models ( just like the `` observed '' r - abundances depend on them ) and also on estimates of r - process contributions ( e.g. , to @xmath8 in and @xmath9sn @xcite ) .",
    "almost all p - isotopes are even - even nuclei , with exception of @xmath8 in ( @xmath10=49 ) , @xmath9sn , @xmath11la , and @xmath12ta@xmath13 .",
    "the isotopic abundances ( ) are @xmath14 orders of magnitude lower than for the respective r- and s - nuclei in the same mass region , with exception of @xmath15mo and @xmath16ru .    the two neutron - magic p - isotopes @xmath17mo ( neutron number @xmath18 ) and @xmath19sm ( @xmath20 ) , and the proton - magic ( charge number @xmath21 ) sn - isotopes @xmath22sn exhibit larger abundances than the neighboring p - nuclei ( ) .",
    "the abundance of @xmath23er also stands out and already b@xmath4fh realized that it may contain considerable contributions from the s - process .",
    "it was indeed found that there are large s - process contributions to @xmath23er , @xmath24gd , and @xmath12ta @xcite , thus possibly removing them from the list of p - isotopes .",
    "if also the abundances of @xmath8 in and @xmath9sn can be explained by modifications of the s - process and/or contributions from the r - process @xcite , this would leave only 30 p - isotopes to be explained by other processes .",
    "the nuclei @xmath11la and @xmath25ta do not fit well the local trend and have much lower abundance than their neighbors .",
    "this indicates a further process at work , also because the standard photodisintegration process can not synthesize them in the required quantity ( see ) .",
    "lists also the isotopic composition as given in @xcite .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are on the abundance relative to other isotopes of the same element .",
    "they introduce additional uncertainties in reaction measurements using natural samples ( see ) . in general the composition uncertainties",
    "are below 5% .",
    "it should be noted that there have been recent measurements with higher precision which had not been included in @xcite , e.g. , @xcite for os .",
    "the modern composition uncertainties for their p - isotopes are below 1% .",
    "a special obstacle not found in the investigation of the s- and r - process is the fact that there are no elements dominated by p - isotopes .",
    "therefore , our knowledge of p - abundances is limited to solar system abundances derived from meteoritic material ( ) and terrestrial isotopic compositions . before astronomical observations of isotopic abundances at the required discrimination level",
    "become feasible ( if ever ) , it is impossible to determine p - abundances in stars of different metallicities and thus to obtain the galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) picture directly . on the other hand , depending on the actual p - production mechanism this may also be problematic for determining early s - process contributions .",
    "if the p - nuclides ( or some of them ) turn out to be primary ( i.e. , independent of metallicity ) or have a different dependence of production on metallicity than the s - process ( perhaps by initially originating from r - nuclei ) , they may give a larger contribution to elemental abundances in old stars than the s - process .",
    "observations of ge and mo in metal - poor stars may cast further light on the origin of the p - nuclei .",

    "this already points to explosive conditions which accommodate both the necessary temperatures for photodisintegrations ( or proton captures on highly charged nuclei ) and a short timescale . the latter is required because it has to be avoided that too much material is transformed in order to achieve the tiny solar p - abundances ( assuming that these are typical ) .",

    "it is crucial that a range of temperatures be present as nuclei in the lower mass part of the p - nuclides require higher temperatures for photodisintegration ( @xmath63 gk ) whereas the ones at higher mass are photodissociated more easily and should not be exposed to too high temperature ( @xmath64 gk ) , as otherwise all heavy p - nuclei would be destroyed .",

    "recent studies , based on the carbon deflagration model of @xcite , found similar problems @xcite .",

    "once the temperature exceeds @xmath78 , photodisintegrations take over and move the nucleosynthesis to the proton - rich side where two processes act : the @xmath0-process , as described above , and additionally rapid proton captures on proton - rich unstable nuclei at @xmath79 .",

    "a complete model would also allow to study the actual amount of seed enhancement ( if any ) in these environments , through strong s - processing either in the companion star or during accretion .",
    "another open question is the actual p - nucleus contribution of type ia supernovae during the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "it is still under debate what fraction of type ia supernova events is actually comprised of the single - degenerate type ( with a companion star ) and how much double - degenerate events ( collision of two wds ) contribute .",
    "explosive h- and he - burning on the surface of a mass - accreting neutron star can explain a type of bursts observed in galactic point - like x - ray sources on timescales of a few to a few tens of seconds @xcite .",
    "such a _ rp - process _ involves sequences of proton captures and @xmath61-decays along the proton dripline @xcite .",
    "how far the burning can move up the nuclear chart depends on details of the hydrodynamics ( convection ) and the amount of accreted protons .",
    "there is a definitive endpoint , however , when the rp - process path runs into the region of te @xmath60-emitters @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the rp - process actually runs that far , only p - nuclides with @xmath86 can be reached through decays of very proton - rich progenitors .",
    "this would conveniently allow to only account for the underproduction of the light p - nuclides , which would be primary .",
    "currently it is unclear whether the produced nuclides can be ejected into the interstellar medium or whether they are trapped in the gravitational field and eventually only modify the surface composition of the neutron star .",
    "the fact that p - nuclides are only produced at the bottom of the burning zone in each burst and have to be quickly moved outwards by strong convection complicates the ejection of significant amounts @xcite .",
    "conditions suited for the synthesis of nuclides in the range of the p - nuclei may also be established by strong neutrino flows acting on hot matter , moving out from ccsn explosions or from accretion disks around compact objects .",
    "they would give rise to a primary production of p - nuclides .",
    "for example , very proton - rich conditions were found in the innermost ejected layers of a ccsn due to the interaction of @xmath87 with the ejected , hot , and dense matter at early times .",
    "the hot matter freezes out from nuclear statistical equilibrium and sequences of proton captures and @xmath61-decays ensue , similar as in the late phase of the rp - process ( ) and in the pn - process ( ) .",
    "the nucleosynthesis timescale is given by the explosion and subsequent freeze - out and is shorter than in the rp - process .",
    "the flow towards heavier elements would be hindered by nuclides with low proton capture q - value and long @xmath61-decay halflives .",
    "similar as in the pn - process , ( n , p ) reactions accelerate the upward flow .",
    "the neutrons stem from the reaction @xmath88 .",
    "although at early times the @xmath89 flux is small , the sheer number of free protons guarantees a constant neutron supply .",
    "thus , this process was termed the _ @xmath74p - process _ by @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed by the calculations of @xcite . like the rp- and pn - processes it may contribute to the light p - nuclides via decays of very proton - rich species , although it is not known up to which mass .",
    "the details depend sensitively on the explosion mechanism , the neutrino emission from the proto - neutron star , and the hydrodynamics governing the ejecta motion .",
    "nuclear uncertainties are discussed in and in @xcite .",
    "accretion disks around compact objects have also been discussed as a viable site for the production of p - nuclei .",
    "such disks can be formed from fallback of material in ccsn or in neutron star mergers .",
    "the production strongly depends on the assumed accretion rate which determines the neutrino trapping inside the disk .",
    "fully consistent hydrodynamic simulations have not been performed yet and the models have to make assumptions on accretion rates , disk properties , and especially the amount of ejected material in wind outflows .",
    "a production of p - nuclei comparable to the one in the o / ne - shell @xmath0-process has been found in parameterized , hot ccsn accretion disks , including the underproduction problem for light p - nuclei @xcite .",
    "conversely , it was shown that only light p - nuclei up to @xmath30mo can be synthesized in parameterized black hole accretion disks under slightly neutron - rich qse ( quasi - statistical equilibrium ) conditions at high accretion rates @xcite but that a full @xmath74p - process can ensue at lower accretion rates @xcite .",
    "the production of the lightest p - nuclei under qse conditions was previously also discussed in the directly ejected matter in a ccsn @xcite . for a detailed discussion of qse conditions ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "recently , magnetically driven jets ejected from rapidly rotating , collapsing massive stars have been studied regarding their nucleosynthesis .",
    "obviously , ejection of the produced nuclei is guaranteed in this case .",
    "again , axisymmetric jet simulations show light p - nucleus production up to @xmath17mo through qse proton captures but it was also suggested that @xmath8 in , @xmath9sn , and @xmath11la can be synthesized through fission in very neutron - rich zones of the jet @xcite .",
    "the conclusions regarding the fission products are highly uncertain , however , because they sensitively depend on unknown fission properties , such as fission barriers and fragment distributions .",
    "conversely , full 3d magneto - hydrodynamic simulations of such jets found very neutron - rich conditions , closer to neutron star merger conditions than to the ones found in ccsn neutrino - wind outflows , precluding the production of p - nuclei @xcite .",
    "the yields of different sources add up throughout the history of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the evolution of chemical enrichment has to be followed in order to fully understand the distribution of p - nuclides in the galaxy .",
    "this is hampered by several problems .",
    "not only have the frequency , spatial distribution , and yields of the different sources to be known but also their dependence on metallicity ( if the p - nucleus production is secondary ) and how the products are mixed in the interstellar medium .",
    "clearly , this poses great challenges both for gce models and for the simulations of each site , including the determination of the ejection of the produced nuclei . for ccsn",
    ", it has been shown that the deficiencies in the @xmath0-process essentially remain also when integrating over a range of stellar masses @xcite .",
    "although this was derived using stars of solar metallicity , it is not expected to be different when including stars at lower metallicity , as the p - production in the @xmath0-process is secondary and scales with the amount of seed nuclei present in the star .",
    "as pointed out above , in the case of the p - nuclides there are not enough observables to constrain well gce models or even single production sites , as the isotopic abundances of p - nuclei can not be separately determined in stellar spectra .",
    "this underlines the importance of analyzing meteoritic material as explained in the following .",
    "combining the isotopic information , e.g. , of extinct radioactivities , with gce allows to put severe constraints on the possible production processes .",
    "for example , shows that processes making @xmath17mo but not @xmath17nb can not have contributed much to the composition of the presolar cloud .",
    "this would rule out a significant contribution of p - nuclides at and above mo from very proton - rich environments .",
    "unlike large planetary bodies , which have had their compositions modified by core / mantle segregation and silicate mantle differentiation , meteorites provide a minimally altered record of the composition of the dust present in the solar protoplanetary disk .",
    "the study of meteorites has helped define the cosmic abundance of the nuclides , and has revealed the presence of presolar grains and extinct radionuclides in the early solar system . in the past decade , significant progress in mass spectrometric techniques have put new constraints on p - nucleosynthesis , in particular on the roles of rp- and @xmath74p - processes to the production of light p - nuclides @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "solar spectroscopy provides critical constraints on the cosmic abundance of key elements such as h , he , c , n and o @xcite .",
    "however , remote techniques do not allow to establish the abundance of p - isotopes .",
    "a class of meteorites known as ci chondrites ( ci stands for carbonaceous chondrite of ivuna - type ) have been shown to contain most elements in proportions that are nearly identical to those measured in the solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "for this reason , ci chondrites have been extensively studied to establish the relative abundances and isotopic compositions of heavy elements that can not be directly measured in the solar photosphere .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that ci chondrite specimens ( e.g. , the orgueil meteorite that fell in france in 1864 and weighted 14 kg total ) can be measured in the laboratory by mass spectrometry , providing highly precise and accurate data .",
    "the only elements for which ci - chondrites do not match the present solar composition are li that is burned in the sun , and volatile elements ( e.g. , h , c , n , noble gases ) that did not fully condense in solids and were removed from the protoplanetary disk when nebular gas was dissipated .",
    "thus , the relative proportions and isotopic ratios of p - nuclides are well known from meteorite measurements ( ) .",
    "silicon is most commonly used to normalize meteoritic to solar photosphere abundances . for the purpose of comparing meteoritic p - isotope abundances with nucleosynthetic model predictions , it is more useful to normalize the data to @xmath65o . the ratios of p - isotopes to @xmath65o are still uncertain because of uncertainties in the abundance of o in the solar photosphere , which was drastically revised downward @xcite .",
    "a difficulty persists , however , as helioseismology requires a larger abundance of o ( and other metals ) to account for the inferred sound speed at depth , as well as other observables @xcite .",
    "it is not known at present what is the cause for this discrepancy but the abundances inferred by one of these methods ( helioseismology versus solar spectroscopy ) must be incorrect .",
    "the solar o abundance was revised from 8.93 dex in 1989 @xcite to 8.69 dex in 2009 @xcite , i.e. , a factor of 1.74 .",
    "this is significant with respect to p - nucleosynthesis as a factor of two mismatch in predicted to measured abundances of p - nuclides relative to @xmath65o is often taken as cutoff between success and failure ( see ) .    in p - isotope abundances",

    "firstly , the s - process in this mass region is well understood and reproduces well the cosmic abundance of @xmath101nd @xcite .",
    "if anything , the s - process produces too much of this isotope rather than too little .",
    "secondly , a 20% @xmath0-process contribution would plot far off the empirical trend of abundance versus mass for p - isotopes .",
    "the empirical relationship gives @xmath176 , while a 20% @xmath0-process contribution would mean @xmath177 , i.e. , a factor of @xmath178 higher than predicted .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath101nd produced in the @xmath0-process comes from the @xmath60-decay of @xmath97sm .",
    "the @xmath97sm/@xmath19sm ratio in the @xmath0-process depends strongly on the relative strength of the reactions @xmath179gd(@xmath0,n)@xmath105gd and @xmath179gd(@xmath0,@xmath60)@xmath19sm but is independent of the seed nuclei .",
    "nuclear physics experiments ( see ) rule out a ratio which would allow to contribute significantly to @xmath101nd .",
    "if confirmed , the cause for the correlation between @xmath101nd and @xmath19sm remains to be explained .",
    "a likely interpretation is that the presolar phase controlling the @xmath0-process sm - nd isotopic anomalies in planetary materials does not contain these elements in solar proportions .",
    "indeed , chemical fractionation of sm and nd during grain condensation can produce a correlation with a steeper slope than expected ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a similar discussion in the context of correlated mo - ru isotope anomalies ) .",
    "isotope anomalies also have been reported for the p - isotopes @xmath55os @xcite and @xmath12w @xcite but further work is needed before these variations can be understood .",
    "the previous sections discussed the astrophysical sites and observational constraints for the production of p - nuclei .",
    "important for modelling nucleosynthesis is a reliable foundation in the nuclear physics required to predict astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "it is important to note that there are fundamental differences between experimental and theoretical studies of reactions on intermediate and heavy nuclei , as appearing in p - nucleosynthesis , and reactions on lighter nuclei up to si .",
    "different nuclear properties are important at low mass than at high mass and new challenges arise , due to the higher nuclear level density ( nld ) and the higher coulomb barriers encountered in heavier nuclei . experimental and theoretical approaches well suited for reactions on lighter nuclei are not directly applicable to heavy nuclei involved in explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "because of the high coulomb barriers and the higher temperatures , giving rise to pronounced stellar effects not encountered in light nuclei to such an extent , experimental investigations are not able to completely determine the astrophysical reaction rate in most cases and have to be supplemented by theory . in the remainder of this review , we discuss the challenges arising and the methods currently available to address them in the quest for providing reliable and accurate reaction rates to study the origin of the p - nuclei .      the astrophysical reaction rate @xmath180 for an interaction between two particles or nuclei in a stellar environment is obtained by folding the maxwell - boltzmann energy distribution @xmath181 , describing the thermal center - of - mass ( c.m . ) motion of the interacting nuclei in a plasma of temperature @xmath182 , with a quantity @xmath183 which is related to the probability that the reaction occurs , and by multiplying the result with the number densities @xmath184 , @xmath185 , i.e. , the number of interacting particles in a unit volume , @xmath186    the stellar reactivity ( or rate per particle pair ) is denoted by @xmath187 . to avoid double counting of pairs",
    ", the kronecker symbol @xmath188 is introduced .",
    "it is unity when the nuclei @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the same and zero otherwise .",
    "the asterisk superscript indicates _",
    "stellar _ quantities , i.e. , including the effect of thermal population of excited nuclear states in a stellar plasma .",
    "depending on temperature and nuclear level structure , a fraction of nuclei is present in an excited state in the plasma , instead of being in the ground state ( g.s . ) .",
    "this has to be considered when calculating the interactions and rates by using the _ stellar cross section _",
    "@xmath183 @xcite @xmath191 which involves a weighted sum over transitions from all initial excited states @xmath192 , with spin @xmath193 and energy @xmath194 , up to the interaction energy @xmath195 , leading to all accessible final states @xmath196 . as usual ,",
    "cross sections for individual transitions @xmath197 are zero for negative energies .",
    "the quantity @xmath198 is nothing else than the partition function of the target nucleus normalized to the ground state spin , and @xmath199 is usually called effective cross section @xcite . the weights @xmath200 of the contributions of excited states to the effective cross section depend linearly on the excitation energy because maxwell - boltzmann energy - distributed projectiles act on each excited state @xcite .",
    "the relevant energies @xmath195 are given by the energy range contributing most to the integral in equation ( [ eq : rate ] ) , see .",
    "although not discussed in further detail here , it is worth mentioning that also weak interactions and decays are affected by the thermal population of excited states .",
    "this is important because it changes the decay lifetimes of nuclei such as , e.g. , @xmath17nb and @xmath12ta , while temperatures are still high during nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the stellar reactivities defined with the effective cross section ",
    "connecting all initial states to all final states  also obey reciprocity , just as the individual transitions @xmath197 do @xcite . the reciprocity relations for a reaction @xmath201 and its reverse reaction @xmath202 are @xcite @xmath203 when @xmath189 , @xmath204 are particles , and @xmath205 when @xmath204 is a photon .",
    "the normalized partition functions @xmath206 and @xmath207 of the nuclei @xmath190 and @xmath208 , respectively , are defined as before .",
    "the photodisintegration reactivity @xmath209 includes a stellar photodisintegration cross section @xmath210 defined in complete analogy to the stellar cross section @xmath183 in equation ( [ eq : effcs ] ) . in relating the capture rate of @xmath211 to the photodisintegration rate @xmath212 , however , it has to be assumed that the denominator @xmath213 of the planck distribution @xmath214 for photons appearing in equation ( [ eq : photoreac ] ) can be replaced by the one from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath215 .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been investigated independently several times @xcite .",
    "the contributions to the integral in ( [ eq : photoreac ] ) have to be negligible at the low energies where @xmath181 and @xmath214 differ considerably .",
    "this is ensured by either a sufficiently large and positive @xmath216 , which causes the integration over the planck distribution to start not at zero energy but rather at a sufficiently large threshold energy , or by vanishing effective cross sections at low energy due to , e.g. , a coulomb barrier .",
    "it turns out that the change in the denominator is a good approximation for the calculation of the rate integrals , especially for the temperatures and reactions encountered in p - nucleus production .",
    "the photodisintegration rate of a nucleus only depends on plasma temperature @xmath182 whereas rates of reactions with particles in the entrance channel depend on @xmath182 and the number density @xmath184 of the projectile .",
    "the number density @xmath184 scales with the plasma matter density @xmath217 and the abundance of the projectile @xmath218 .",
    "a variation of plasma density , on the other hand , will not affect photodisintegration of a nucleus .",
    "therefore the ratio of temperature and density sets the ratio of photodisintegration to capture rates ( for a fixed q - value ) @xmath219 this is the reason why at conditions with large @xmath220 ( e.g. , high proton densities ) , capture reactions can balance photodisintegrations even at high @xmath182 , leading to equilibrium values for the abundances @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "it has to be emphasized that and only hold when using the stellar and effective cross sections @xmath183 and @xmath199 , respectively , in the calculation of the reactivity , _ not _ with the usual laboratory cross sections @xmath223 where @xmath224 if the target is in the g.s . in reactions involving intermediate and heavy nuclei at high plasma temperatures , transitions on excited states of the target will be significant in most cases ( see ) .        in order to decide which type of reactions have to be considered in the prediction of the stellar cross sections , the relative interaction energies @xmath195 appearing in the astrophysical plasma have to be known .",
    "these energies and the location of the maximum of the integrand can be found in @xcite .",
    "they have to be derived by inspection of the actual integrand in ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "the simple , frequently used formula for estimating the gamow window ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) from the charges of projectile and target is only applicable when the energy dependence of the cross section is fully given by the entrance channel .",
    "this has been found inadequate for many reactions except those involving light nuclei @xcite and thus is not applicable for the reactions appearing in the production of the p - nuclei .",
    "the effective temperature range for the formation of p - nuclei is @xmath225 when considering both a @xmath0-process and a proton - rich environment , such as required for the @xmath74p - process .",
    "this translates into relative interaction energies of about @xmath226 mev for protons ( at the high end of the temperature range and for the light p - nuclei ) in the @xmath0-process .",
    "the relevant energies shift more strongly with charge for @xmath60-particles ( at the low end of the temperature range and for the heavier p - nuclei ) and energies are in the ranges of , e.g. , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 mev , respectively , at 2 gk and for charges @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "proton captures are only of limited importance in the @xmath74p - process because a ( p,@xmath0)-(@xmath0,p ) equilibrium is upheld most of the time @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium proton captures at the low end of the temperature range yield interaction energies of about @xmath14 mev .",
    "crucial for @xmath74p - processing is the acting of ( n , p ) reactions at all temperatures .",
    "this results in neutron energies up to 1 mev in ( n , p ) . of further importance in both @xmath0-process and proton - rich nucleosynthesis",
    "are ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions and their inverses , also for the whole temperature range .",
    "this implies neutron energies of up to 1400 kev for neutron captures .",
    "the compound formation and excitation energy @xmath233 depends on the interaction energy @xmath195 and the reaction q - value @xmath234 .",
    "the nuclear level density ( nld ) integrated over the compound excitation energies obtained with the relevant energy ranges from determines which reaction mechanism will dominate . with only few levels within the energy range appearing in the integration of the reactivity ,",
    "individual resonances have to be considered . with a high nld ,",
    "individual resonances are not resolved anymore and the sum over individual resonances can be replaced by averaged resonances which should reproduce the integrated properties ( widths ) of all resonances at all energies @xcite .",
    "this is the statistical hauser - feshbach model of compound nuclear reactions .",
    "its astrophysical application has been discussed in many recent publications @xcite and we do not want to repeat all the details here .    averaged properties can be predicted with higher accuracy than individual resonances in most cases . it is important to note , however , that there is a difference in the application of the statistical model to the calculation of cross sections and to reactivities . since the calculation of the reactivity involves an additional averaging over the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , it is more `` forgiving '' when fluctuations in the cross sections are not reproduced as long as the average value is correct across the relevant energy range .",
    "therefore , the hauser - feshbach model can be applied at lower nld at compound formation energy for the calculation of the rate than for the calculation of the cross section .",
    "put differently , even when fluctuations due to resonances are seen in the experimental cross sections but not in the hauser - feshbach predictions , the model may still yield a reliable rate provided it gives the same maxwell - boltzmann average .",
    "see for further details .    combining the above with the typical interaction energies quoted in , it is easy to see that the statistical model is applicable for all reactions involved in p - nucleosynthesis ( see sections [ sec : sites ] and [ sec : importantreactions ] for the important reactions ) . problems may arise for ( p,@xmath0 ) and ( @xmath0,p ) on nuclei with magic proton number or very proton - rich nuclei .",
    "the proton separation energy decreases for proton - richer isotopes and this shifts the compound formation energy to regions of lower nld . both , the @xmath0- and the @xmath74p - process , however , do not involve nuclei close to the driplines where it is known that the statistical model can not be applied anymore @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a ( p,@xmath0)-(@xmath0,p ) equilibrium in the @xmath74p - process , diminishing the importance of individual reactions @xcite .",
    "this leaves proton reactions at charge @xmath235 and @xmath21 , the latter only being important in the @xmath0-process , as possible cases where the statistical model may not be fully applicable at all temperatures and individual resonances may have to be considered",
    ".    reactions involving @xmath60-particles should not be problematic for the statistical model even though they are important in a region of @xmath60-emitters with negative ( @xmath60,@xmath0 ) q - values ( see ) , due to their much higher astrophysically relevant interaction energies .",
    "it is well known that direct reactions are important at interaction energies above several tens of mev because of the reduced compound formation probability @xcite . in light nuclei with widely spaced energy levels",
    ", direct reactions can give important contributions to the cross sections between resonances . in the p - nucleus mass range , however , direct reactions are not expected to contribute to the astrophysical reaction rates due to the generally higher nld at the compound formation energy @xmath236 , as discussed in the previous .",
    "it has been realized recently , however , that low - energy direct inelastic scattering has to be included in the analysis of ( @xmath60,@xmath0 ) laboratory cross sections @xcite . with high coulomb barriers ,",
    "coulomb excitation @xcite can become non - negligible at low interaction energies , modifying the experimental yield .",
    "data is scarce close to the astrophysically relevant energy region ( see ) but an overprediction of @xmath60-induced cross sections relative to the experimental values was observed for several cases while standard predictions worked well for others .",
    "many attempts to consistently describe the data with modified global @xmath60+nucleus optical potentials have failed .",
    "accounting for coulomb excitation at low energies can explain the deviations at least partially and will pave the way for an improved global understanding of reaction rates involving @xmath60-particles .",
    "gives an example of how strong the coulomb excitation effect can be .",
    "nuclear excitation is negligible at the low energies relevant for astrophysics as the coulomb scattering takes place far outside the nucleus .",
    "obviously , there is no coulomb excitation for ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates which are needed for the @xmath0-process .",
    "therefore , an optical potential describing the @xmath60-emission has to be used . due to detailed balance considerations",
    ", this has to be similar to one describing compound formation in the absence of coulomb excitation . nevertheless , even when using charged - particle induced reactions , direct reactions not leading to a compound formation can be considered in the hauser - feshbach model quite generally by simply renormalizing the @xmath60-transmission coefficients @xmath237 in the entrance channel for each partial wave @xmath238 @xcite @xmath239 where the transmission coefficient @xmath240 into the direct channel can be derived from the direct cross section @xmath241 . here ,",
    "@xmath241 is the coulomb excitation cross section calculated in a fully quantum mechanical approach as , e.g. , shown in @xcite . in this approach , the transmission coefficients @xmath237 for compound formation",
    "are computed using an optical potential _ not _ including the direct reactions , or more specifically the coulomb excitation , in its imaginary part .",
    "this optical potential thus only describes the absorption into the compound channel and not into all inelastic channels . only with such a potential the stellar reactivity of the ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) reaction",
    "can be computed by applying .",
    "although various astrophysical sites were presented in , the actual types of participating reactions are limited . in environments producing the light p - nuclei under qse conditions",
    ", individual proton captures in the vicinity of these p - nuclei only play a role in the brief freeze - out phase .",
    "while the reactions in a given mass region are in equilibrium , the abundances are determined by the known nuclear mass differences @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is encountered for the proton captures in the @xmath74p - process which are in ( p,@xmath0)-(@xmath0,p ) equilibrium most of the time @xcite .",
    "therefore a variation of the proton capture rates only has limited impact but may locally redistribute isotopic abundances @xcite . not in equilibrium , however , are the ( n , p ) reactions required to overcome waiting points with low proton - capture q - value . in the mass region relevant for the production of light p - nuclei , they occur at the @xmath242 line , starting at @xmath243ni and @xmath244 mass units towards stability @xcite .",
    "they crucially determine the onset of the @xmath74p - process as well as how quickly matter can be processed towards higher masses .",
    "the schematic reaction path for the @xmath0-process has been shown in .",
    "the nuclei and reactions involved in the @xmath0-processes in various hot environments do not largely differ .",
    "the permitted temperature range is rather tightly constrained by the fact that photodisintegrations must be possible but not so strong as to completely destroy the p - nuclei or their radioactive progenitors .",
    "the main difference between the sites suggested in is the amount and distribution of seed nuclei to be photodisintegrated .",
    "this will change the flow in a given reaction sequence accordingly but it should be noted that abundance ratios of nuclei originating from the same seed are not affected by this , such as the @xmath97sm/@xmath19sm production ratio discussed in sections [ sec : gceextinct ] and [ sec : anomalies ] .",
    "another difference arises from the temperature evolution which is not necessarily the same in , say , ccsn and snia . since different types of reactions",

    "light p - nuclei are predominantly produced at higher temperatures ( allowing efficient photodisintegration of the nuclei around mass @xmath247 ) whereas the production maximum of the heavy species lies towards the lower end of the temperature range .",
    "neutron captures and especially ( @xmath0,n ) reactions are important throughout the @xmath0-process network as the photodisintegration of stable nuclides commences with ( @xmath0,n ) reactions until sufficiently proton - rich nuclei have been produced and ( @xmath0,p ) or ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) reactions become faster .",
    "the released neutrons can be captured again by other nuclei and push the reaction path back to stability in the region of the light p - nuclides .    in each isotopic chain",

    "historically , this endpoint of the ( @xmath0,n ) chain has been called `` branching '' , inspired by the branchings in the s - process path @xcite .",
    "a more appropriate term would be `` deflection ( point ) '' , though , because  unlike in the s - process ",
    "the reaction path does not split necessarily into two branches .",
    "the relative changes of the photodisintegration rates from one isotope to the next are so large that at each isotope only one of the emissions dominates . as an example",
    ", a comparison of photodisintegration rates within a chain of mo isotopes is shown in .",
    "it can be seen how rapidly ( @xmath0,n ) rates are decreasing with decreasing neutron number , whereas ( @xmath0,p ) is strongly increasing because it becomes easier to emit a proton than a neutron .",
    "the ( @xmath0,n ) rates exhibit strong odd - even staggering .",
    "since in a reaction sequence , the timescale of the whole sequence is determined by the slowest reaction link(s ) , it is apparent that the ( @xmath0,n ) sequences will be mostly sensitive to a variation in the slow ( @xmath0,n ) rates and these have to be studied preferentially .",
    "there are very few cases of two ( or even three ) types of emissions being comparable at a single isotope or over a short series of isotopes and these strongly depend on the optical potentials used . in these cases",
    ", true branchings would appear .",
    "they are mostly found in the range of the heavier p - nuclides , where ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) competes with ( @xmath0,n ) as explained below , because the ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates do not vary as systematically as the rates for neutron or proton emission .",
    "examination of the deflection points easily shows that at higher mass ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) deflections are encountered whereas at lower mass most deflections are caused by ( @xmath0,p ) due to the distribution of reaction q - values and coulomb barriers @xcite .",
    "this is a well - understood nuclear structure effect and it can be seen in figures [ fig : deflectlow ] and [ fig : deflecthi ] that @xmath60-emissions compete with neutron emission above @xmath20 .",
    "the rate field plots in the two figures give the dominant destruction reaction for each nuclide , derived from a comparison of the rates per nucleus . for photodisintegration reactions",
    "the _ rate per nucleus _ is just the reactivity @xmath248 as defined in .",
    "it should be noted that these are not reaction flows as they neglect the abundances of the interacting nuclei . in the @xmath0-process ,",
    "however , this is a good approximation because , except for neutron captures mentioned below , there are no reactions counteracting the photodisintegration of a single nucleus .",
    "therefore , the rate per nucleus is very suitable to also study the competition of different reaction channels .",
    "the possible competition points are marked by diamond shapes in figures [ fig : deflectlow ] and [ fig : deflecthi ] .",
    "they are defined by two or more reaction channels having comparable rates within the assumed uncertainties in the prediction .",
    "the plots are based on calculations with the smaragd code @xcite using the standard optical potentials of @xcite for neutrons and protons , and @xcite for @xmath60-particles .",
    "the assumed uncertainties were factors of two and three ( up and down ) for ( @xmath0,n ) and ( @xmath0,p ) , respectively , while one fifth of the predicted value was assumed to be the lower limit for the range of possible ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates .",
    "since the reaction flow is coming from stable isotopes , the first competition point in each ( @xmath0,n ) sequence is of major importance . only if it is shown to be dominated by ( @xmath0,n ) , the second competition in a chain",
    "will also be of interest , and so on .",
    "the above considerations explain the results of earlier studies with systematic variations of the ( @xmath0,p ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates by constant factors @xcite or using a selection of different optical potentials for the ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates @xcite .",
    "they also found that uncertainties in the ( @xmath0,p ) rates mainly affect the lower half , whereas those in the ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates affect the upper half of the p - nuclide mass range .",
    "the higher the plasma temperature the further into the proton - rich side ( @xmath0,n ) reactions can act . at low temperature , even the ( @xmath0,n ) reaction sequence may not be able to move much beyond the stable isotopes because it becomes too slow compared to the explosive timescale ( and neutron capture may be faster ) .",
    "obviously , ( @xmath0,p ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) are even slower in those cases and the photodisintegrations are `` stuck '' , just slightly reordering stable abundances .",
    "because of the tight limits on permissible temperatures to successfully produce p - nuclei , the competition points will not shift by more than @xmath14 mass units , if at all .",
    "more detailed investigations of the temperature dependence of deflections , competitions , and branchings can be found in @xcite , where each later work supersedes the previous one with updated reaction rate calculations and further studies of the dependence on optical potentials .",
    "the free neutrons released by ( @xmath0,n ) affect the final abundances of light p - nuclei ( up to sn ) in the @xmath0-process in several ways .",
    "the major effect is that of destruction of light p - nuclei by neutron captures in zones with sufficiently high temperature to photodisintegrate heavier nuclei but not enough for the lighter species .",
    "no change in the abundances of light p - nuclei would then be expected when only considering photodisintegration but such zones show strong destruction of these nuclei , as can be seen in figures [ fig : peak1 ] and [ fig : peak2 ] .",
    "this is because the neutrons released in the destruction of the heavier species destroy the pre - existing p - nuclei ( if non - zero initial metallicity was assumed ) .",
    "since all ejected zones are added up , this may affect the total yield of light p - nuclei .",
    "neutron captures also counteract ( @xmath0,n ) at temperatures at which the light p - nuclei are destroyed @xcite .",
    "this may prevent the ( @xmath0,n ) flow to move far into the proton - rich side .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that ( n , p ) reactions can push the @xmath0-process path back to stability as well . obviously , the availability of neutrons depends on the assumed seed abundance distribution and especially on the abundances in the region of heavier nuclei , which are destroyed already at low temperature .",
    "therefore this will require special attention in models assuming strongly enhanced seeds , such as in the single - degenerate snia model ( ) .",
    "finally , neutron captures _ before _ the onset of the @xmath0-process can indirectly influence the p - production by modifying the seed abundances . in massive stars ,",
    "the weak s - processing sensitively depends on the @xmath82ne(@xmath60,n ) rate , acting as the dominant neutron source ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the effect of a variation of this rate ) . for s - processing in agb stars ,",
    "this rate and @xmath249c(@xmath60,n ) are important .",
    "since the seed enhancement in thermonuclear burning of snia is supposed to come from the matter accreted from a companion star ( or s - processing during the accretion ) , these rates would also affect the seeds and @xmath0-processing in these models were they simulated self - consistently .",
    "before the main nuclear uncertainties in the synthesis of p - nuclei can be summarized , it is necessary to define the sensitivity of reaction rates and cross sections .",
    "while the definition of an `` error bar '' for theory is complicated by fundamental differences to attaching an experimental error ( see @xcite for details ) , properly defined sensitivities immediately allow to see the impact of various uncertainties in nuclear properties and input .",
    "this also implies that it is easy to see which properties are in need of a better description in order to better constrain the astrophysical rate . in order to quantify the impact of a variation of a model quantity @xmath250 ( directly taken from input or derived from it ) on the final result @xmath251 ( which is either a cross section or a reactivity ) , the relative sensitivity @xmath252 is defined as @xcite @xmath253",

    "sometimes also the nld is varied although it can be shown that it mainly affects the @xmath0-width in astrophysical applications .",
    "this is due to the fact that the particle widths are dominated by transitions to low - lying levels whereas @xmath0-transitions to a continuum of levels at higher excitation of the compound nucleus determine the @xmath0-width @xcite",
    ".    extended tables of sensitivities for reactions on target nuclei between the driplines and with @xmath264 have been published in @xcite , for rates as well as cross sections .",
    "these tables are used to determine which nuclear properties have to be known to accurately determine a rate , once it has been identified as relevant for nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is important to note that , according to and , the same sensitivities apply to forward and reverse stellar rates , e.g. , for the stellar capture rates as well as the stellar photodisintegration rates .    despite of the number of suggested sites ,",
    "the nuclear physics underlying the p - production and its uncertainty is similar in all of them , except for the contribution of rapid proton capture processes far from stability .",
    "it has been argued in that the latter can not contribute significantly to the p - nuclei from mo upwards . since proton captures are in equilibrium in those models , the main uncertainties lie in the reactions bridging the waiting points close to @xmath242 . as mentioned in sections [",

    "contrary to astrophysical neutron captures at stability , no isolated resonances are contributing and the rates are only sensitive to the neutron width whereas in neutron captures at stability also the @xmath0-width is important .",
    "the calculation of the neutron width depends on the optical potential used and on the knowledge of low - lying levels in both target and final nucleus . in the unstable region ,",

    "this has not been sufficiently addressed so far , with a few exceptions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "what is the actual impact of uncertainties in the photodisintegration rates on the production of the p - nuclides ?",
    "although the @xmath0-process is not an equilibrium process and a reaction network with a large number of individual reactions has to be employed , it has become apparent in that not all possible reactions in the network have to be known with high accuracy .",
    "rather , only the dominant reaction sequences have to be known accurately , and within such a sequence the slowest reaction as it determines the amount of processing within the given short timescale of the explosive process .",
    "charged particle rates are important only at or close to the deflection points because they are many orders of magnitude smaller than the ( @xmath0,n ) rates on neutron - richer isotopes .    as a general observation",
    "it was found that the @xmath0-width is not relevant in astrophysical charged particle captures on intermediate and heavy mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coulomb barrier suppresses the proton- and @xmath60-widths at low energy and makes them smaller than the @xmath0-widths at astrophysical interaction energies .",
    "the cross sections and rates will always be most sensitive to the channel with the smallest width .",
    "it also follows from this that whenever an @xmath60-particle is involved , the reaction will be mostly sensitive to its channel .",
    "the situation for neutron captures is more diverse . for most nuclei close to stability ,",
    "the rates are strongly sensitive to the @xmath0-width . in between magic neutron numbers along stability and especially in the region of deformed nuclei , however , they are also or even more sensitive to the neutron - width ( see figures 14 , 15 in @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the compound nuclei in these regions have higher level densities and this leads to comparable sizes of the neutron- and @xmath0-widths at astrophysical energies .",
    "a comparison of theory to experimental data along stability revealed that the uncertainties are within a factor of two , with an average deviation of better than 30% @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0-process does not go far out into the unstable region , similar uncertainties are expected .",
    "charged particle captures and photodisintegrations are only sensitive to the optical potential at the astrophysically relevant low energies .",
    "these optical potentials are usually derived from elastic scattering at higher energies and are thus not well constrained around the coulomb barrier .",
    "especially the imaginary part should be energy - dependent ( see @xcite for more details on optical potentials in astrophysical rate predictions and the influence of other nuclear properties ) .",
    "particular problems persist with @xmath60-captures at energies and in the mass region relevant for the @xmath0-process .",
    "comparisons of theoretical predictions with the few available data at low energy ( see ) revealed a mixed pattern of good reproduction and some cases of maximally @xmath244 times overprediction of the ( @xmath60,@xmath0 ) cross sections when using the `` standard '' potential of @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; see also ) .",

    "it has a completely different energy dependence , though , and yields a value higher by almost two orders of magnitude than the extrapolation of the data to the astrophysically relevant energy of 9 mev .",
    "applying to correct the prediction of the laboratory value for the fact that part of the @xmath60-flux is going into the direct inelastic channel , which is not included in the optical potential , leads to calculated cross sections which reproduce the energy dependence of the data but are too high by a factor of 3 .",
    "the optical potential should be corrected only to account for this factor , i.e. , the @xmath60-width should be divided by this factor as shown in the figure .",
    "this corrected @xmath60-potential  but without further consideration of the coulomb excitation ( as explained in )  has to be employed to calculate the stellar @xmath60-capture reactivity from which the actually relevant ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rate is derived .",
    "the s - factor is lower than the standard value by about a factor of two at 9 mev .",
    "elastic @xmath60-scattering experiments at low energy , if feasible , may help to constrain the @xmath60-width renormalization , see , because the s - factor and cross sections at the upper end of the measured energy range are not only sensitive to the @xmath60-width but also to the neutron and the @xmath0-width .",
    "other reactions may not even need changes to the optical potential and the apparent discrepancies may be explained by the laboratory coulomb excitation alone @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties involved are the requirement to know precise b(e2 ) transition strengths ( which is challenging for odd nuclei with non - zero g.s .",
    "spin ) and the need to accurately calculate coulomb barrier penetrabilities at very low @xmath60-energies .",
    "while the standard @xmath60+nucleus potential most widely used in astrophysical applications is a purely phenomenological one , the optical potentials for protons and neutrons used in the prediction of astrophysical rates and also the interpretation of nuclear data are based on a more microscopic treatment , a brckner - hartree - fock calculation with the local density approximation including nuclear matter density distributions , which are in turn derived from microscopic calculations @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , that the isovector part of the potential is not well constrained by scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "so far , this has not been found to give a noticeable effect in neutron captures at stability but may introduce an additional uncertainty both at the far neutron- and the proton - rich side , whereever the neutron - width is dominating the rate . also in comparison to measured low - energy ( p,@xmath0 ) cross sections , calculations using these potentials often have been in very good agreement with the data , sometimes being off by a maximal factor of two ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in general , the uncertainty in the astrophysical rates caused by the nucleon optical potentials seems to be much lower than for the @xmath60-capture rates .",
    "recent ( p,@xmath0 ) and ( p , n ) data of higher precision close to the astrophysically relevant energy window , however , revealed a possible need for modification of the imaginary part of the nucleon potentials @xcite .",
    "a consistently increased strength of the imaginary part at low energies improves the reproduction of the experimental data for a number of reactions .",
    "it has become apparent in the previous sections that several hundreds of reactions contribute to the synthesis of the comparatively few p - nuclides .",
    "the vast majority of the astrophysical reaction rates has only been predicted theoretically .",
    "experimental data close to astrophysically relevant energies are very scarce , especially for charged - particle reactions .",

    "only those isotopes are included where the motivation of the experiments was the origin of the p - nuclides . as can be seen ,",
    "currently proton capture measurements are available for about 30 isotopes along the line of stability .",
    "the measurements are concentrated mainly in the lower mass region of the p - isotopes which is in line with the fact that ( @xmath0,p ) reactions play the more important role in the lower mass range of a @xmath0-process network ( see ) .",
    "data for ( @xmath266 ) reactions are even more scarce , leaving the theoretical reaction rate calculations largely untested . moreover , the important higher mass region is almost completely unexplored , especially close to astrophysical energies .",
    "figures [ fig : pg_measured ] and [ fig : ag_measured ] show only those isotopes where radiative capture cross sections have been measured . on the other hand ,",
    "particle emitting reaction cross sections , such as ( p , n ) , ( @xmath60,n ) or ( @xmath60,p ) , have also been measured along with the ( p,@xmath0 ) or ( @xmath266 ) reactions , or on their own right .",
    "these reactions can provide valuable additional information to constrain the theoretical description of astrophysically relevant nuclear properties as explained below .",
    "the situation is somewhat better regarding neutron - induced reactions along stability as the low - energy cross sections for neutron captures have been determined for s - process studies .",
    "the kadonis database @xcite centrally compiles data and provides recommended values for maxwellian averaged cross sections ( macs ) at 30 kev and reactivities up to 100 kev .",
    "unfortunately , this is only of limited use for the @xmath0-process as peak temperatures of @xmath244 gk correspond to maxwellian energies of @xmath267 kev but require measured neutron capture cross sections up to 1400 kev , which is beyond the measured range for most nuclei .",
    "the standard way to deal with this is to renormalize hauser - feshbach calculations to the measured value at one energy ( usually at 30 kev , but 100 kev have been discussed as possible alternative ) in order to get an energy dependence for extrapolation to higher ( and lower ) energies .",
    "this can be problematic when the hauser - feshbach model is not applicable at the renormalization energy .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out recently that the renormalization procedure applied so far has not properly included the stellar effect of thermal population of excited states ( see below ) @xcite .",
    "the proper renormalization is discussed in .    summarizing the available data for studying explosive burning",
    "it becomes apparent that , with few exceptions , almost no measurements in the relevant energy region are available .",
    "although , as discussed in , high - temperature environments severely limit the possibility to directly determine astrophysical reactivities , there is an urgent need to experimentally cover the relevant energy range to obtain data for the improvement of the theoretical predictions . given the shortcomings and diversity of processes suggested for the production of p - nuclei ( ) , a reliable database and reliable predictions are needed as a firm basis for future investigations . the accurate knowledge of reaction rates or , at least",
    ", their realistic uncertainties may allow to rule out certain astrophysical models on the grounds of nuclear physics considerations .",
    "there are several challenges hampering the direct determination of stellar reactivities by experiments .",

    "reactions involved in the production of p - nuclei thus pose special problems , not or on a much smaller level encountered in the experimental study of reactions with light nuclei and in hydrostatic burning at lower temperature .",
    "the main challenges include ( i ) reactions on unstable nuclei , ( ii ) tiny cross sections at astrophysically relevant energies , ( iii ) different sensitivities of the cross sections inside and outside of the astrophysical energy window , ( iv ) large differences between the stellar cross section and the laboratory cross section . in this section ,",

    "the interaction energies are small by nuclear physics standards .",
    "although the energy windows for reactions involving charged particles in the entrance or exit channel are shifted to higher energy with increasing charge , the cross sections are also strongly suppressed by the coulomb barrier .",
    "this results in low counting rates in laboratory experiments and requires efficient detectors as well as excellent background suppression .",
    "although there has been recent experimental progress ( ) , the astrophysically relevant energy window has only been reached in a few cases due to the tiny charged - particle cross sections , and a full coverage of such a window for @xmath0-process conditions has not been achieved yet .",
    "obviously , this does not apply to neutron captures but high accuracy measurements covering the full @xmath0-process energy window are also scarce .",
    "low nuclear absorption cross sections are also an obstacle for scattering experiments with charged particles .",

    "it is very important to measure in the correct energy range or at least close to it .",
    "the reason is that cross sections above the astrophysical energies may exhibit a completely different sensitivity to nuclear properties which complicates extrapolation .",
    "for the same reason , comparisons with theoretical predictions outside the astrophysical energy range are only helpful when the measured cross sections show the same sensitivities as the astrophysical reactivity .",

    "if good agreement was found , on the other hand , between experiment and theory at higher energy , this does not constrain the uncertainty of the reaction rate . such sensitivity considerations and plots",
    "have become an essential tool in the planning and interpretation of experiments .",
    "further examples regarding the application of sensitivity plots to the astrophysical interpretation of experimental data are found in @xcite and references therein .",

    "laboratory cross sections @xmath271 as defined in exhibit different sensitivities in forward and reverse reactions , whereas it follows from the reciprocity relations , that the sensitivities of the stellar reaction rates are the same for forward and reverse reaction .",
    "it is also to be noted that even in the astrophysical energy range laboratory cross sections do not necessarily show the same sensitivity as the stellar rate .",
    "this depends on the ground state contribution @xmath272 to the stellar rate ( see below ) and/or the sensitivities of the transitions from excited states in the target nucleus . usually the cross section in the reaction direction with larger @xmath272 will behave more similar to the stellar rate .",

    "since the weights of the excited state contributions also include a dependence on the energy @xmath195 , which is confined to the astrophysically relevant energy window , even more levels at higher excitation energy can contribute for charged particle reactions than for neutron captures at the same temperature .",
    "this is because the energy window is shifted to higher energies by the cross section dependence on the coulomb barrier . and",

    "the fundamental differences between error determinations in experiment and theory are discussed in @xcite and appropriate choices are suggested in and in @xcite .",

    "as argued above , the smallest stellar correction usually is found in the direction of positive q - value . and the tables in @xcite",
    ", however , contain a few exceptions to the q - value rule .",
    "for example , ( @xmath60,@xmath0 ) reactions with negative q - values appear in the @xmath0-process network and show smaller corrections than their photodisintegration counterparts . among them is , for example , the important case of @xmath19sm(@xmath60,@xmath0)@xmath179gd with @xmath305 .",
    "these cases can be explained by a _",
    "coulomb suppression effect _ , first pointed out in @xcite and studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "since the relative interaction energies @xmath306 of transitions commencing on excited levels decrease with increasing @xmath194 , cross sections @xmath273 strongly depending on @xmath307 will be suppressed for higher lying levels . for large coulomb barriers this can result in a much faster suppression of excited state contributions to the stellar rate than expected from the weights @xmath308 . if there is a much higher coulomb barrier in the entrance channel of a reaction with negative q - value than in its exit channel ( e.g. , when there is no barrier present as for ( @xmath60,@xmath0 ) or ( p , n ) reactions ) , this can yield a larger @xmath272 in the direction of negative q - value than in the other direction . on this grounds",

    "contribution @xmath272 .",
    "a further constraint is the fact that most of the reactions involve unstable nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , measurements can provide important information on specific transitions and parts of the stellar rate which can be compared to predictions of theoretical models .",
    "a good example are the past ( @xmath60,@xmath0 ) and ( p,@xmath0 ) measurements at low energies which have shown deficiencies in the description of low - energy charged - particle widths ( see ) .",
    "another example would be studies of single transitions to better constrain excited state contributions .",
    "essential for the development of reaction models , which can also be extended into the region of unstable nuclei , is to have systematic measurements across larger mass ranges .",

    ", no direct information can be inferred for the stellar reaction rate .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out in , the experimental study of @xmath0-induced reactions can provide useful information for certain nuclear properties relevant to heavy element nucleosynthesis . the experimentally determined ( @xmath0,@xmath319 ) cross section ( where @xmath319 can be a neutron , a proton , or an @xmath60-particle ) probes particle transitions into the final nucleus initiated by a well - defined @xmath0-transition from the g.s .  of the target nucleus .",
    "theoretical predictions for the relevant transitions can then be tested by comparing them with the measured photodisintegration cross section .",
    "again , the sensitivity of the reaction ( see sections [ sec : sensi ] and [ sec : expsensi ] ) has to be carefully checked to see what can be extracted from such a measurement .",
    "the sensitivities depend on the initial @xmath0-energy and the particle separation energies .",
    "the latter define the relative interaction energies @xmath307 ( i.e. , the energies of the emitted particles ) and thus the particle widths . as mentioned in , the channel with the smallest width determines the sensitivity of the cross section . for laboratory ( @xmath0,n ) reactions , this is always the @xmath0-width .",
    "a comparison of predicted laboratory ( @xmath0,n ) cross sections and measured ones , however , does not test a quantity that is of relevance in the astrophysical application for two reasons .",
    "firstly , astrophysical charged - particle captures and photodisintegrations depend solely on the charged - particle widths as can be verified by inspection of the figures and tables given in @xcite . secondly ,",
    "although astrophysical neutron captures and ( @xmath0,n ) do partially depend on the @xmath0-widths , they are sensitive to a different part of the @xmath0-strength function than can be tested in a laboratory experiment .",
    "the relevant @xmath0-transitions are those with @xmath320 mev downwards from states a few tens to a few hundreds of kev above the neutron threshold @xcite . according to the reciprocity relation ,",
    "this applies to stellar capture rates as well as photodisintegration rates . assuming the validity of the brink - axel hypothesis @xcite and using low @xmath0-energies on the nuclear g.s .",
    "does not help because the strength function can not be probed below the particle emission threshold .",
    "a more promising approach is to study partial particle emission cross sections , such as ( @xmath0,n@xmath321 ) , ( @xmath0,n@xmath322 ) , and so on .",
    "their ratio depends , apart from spin selection rules , on the particle emitting transitions and can thus be used to test the prediction of the ratios of g.s .",
    "particle transitions to transitions on excited states .",
    "this is then relevant to astrophysical applications , to study the interaction potentials and the stellar excitation effects ( see , e.g. , ) . on - line detection of the outgoing particle ( see below ) is required for this .",
    "the same can be done for charged particle emission .",
    "in addition , depending on the nucleus and the @xmath0-energy used , photodisintegration with charged particle emission is sensitive to the particle channel and can thus be used to test , e.g. , optical potentials .",
    "comparing @xmath60-emission data to predictions would be of particular interest regarding the action of the coulomb excitation effect described in .",
    "it would imply different transmission coefficients for @xmath60-capture and @xmath60-emission and should not show up in the photodisintegration results .",
    "partial cross sections are helpful also in this case because they allow testing at different relative interaction energies .    in the remainder of this section",
    "the available experimental techniques and those @xmath0-induced reaction cross section measurements are reviewed for which the @xmath0-process was specified as motivation .",
    "experimental data on @xmath0-induced reactions are mainly available around the giant dipole resonance , i.e. , at much higher energy than important for astrophysics .",
    "owing to the small cross section and other technical difficulties ( see below ) , only very few measured cross sections are available at lower energies .",
    "different experimental approaches can be used to measure low - energy @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections .",
    "the common requirement of these techniques is a high @xmath0-flux in order to measure low cross sections . if the aim is to measure excitation functions ( i.e. , the cross section as a function of energy ) , a monoenergetic @xmath0-beam is needed .",
    "quasi - monoenergetic @xmath0-rays can be obtained with the laser compton scattering technique . in this method @xmath0-rays",
    "are produced by head - on collision of laser photons with relativistic electrons .",
    "this method has been successfully applied for several reactions , e.g. , at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology ( aist ) , tsukuba , japan @xcite .",
    "there are proposals for performing @xmath0-process studies also at the high intensity @xmath0-ray source ( hi@xmath0s ) at duke university , usa .",
    "another method for @xmath0-induced reaction studies is the application of bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "if a high - energy electron beam hits a radiator target , continuous energy bremsstrahlung radiation is produced with an endpoint energy equal to the energy of the electron beam .",
    "since the @xmath0-energy spectrum is continuous , no direct measurement of the excitation function is possible . by the superposition of several bremsstrahlung spectra of different endpoint energies ,",
    "however , the high - energy part of a thermal photon flux can be approximated well @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reaction rate of a photodisintegration reaction can be measured instead of the cross section itself . since the target is always in its g.s . , only the g.s .",
    "contribution to the reaction rate can , of course , be measured .",
    "several @xmath0-induced reactions have been studied with this method at the s - dalinac facility in darmstadt , germany @xcite , and at the elbe facility in dresden - rossendorf , germany @xcite ( see ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung radiation method can be improved towards a quasi - monochromatic @xmath0-beam by applying the so - called tagger technique . in this method ,",
    "the electron beam hits a thin radiator target where it can be guaranteed that only one bremsstrahlung photon is produced by one electron .",
    "if the remaining energy of the electron is then measured , the @xmath0-energy can be inferred and the required @xmath0-energy with relatively low energy spread can be selected .",
    "such a method has been recently developed at the s - dalinac facility @xcite .",
    "intense @xmath0-beams created by ultra - high intensity lasers may open a new horzion in the study of @xmath0-induced reactions in the near future .",
    "one of the four pillars of the european eli ( extreme light infrastructure ) facility to be built in magurele , romania , will be devoted to laser - based nuclear physics ( eli - np ) .",
    "the white book of the eli - np project @xcite includes the study of the @xmath0-process as one of the objectives of the facility .",
    "the very brilliant , intense @xmath0-beam of up to 19 mev , 0.1% bandwidth , and 10@xmath249 @xmath0/s intensity is hoped to enable the measurement of ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) and ( @xmath0,p ) reaction cross sections on many isotopes .",
    "two distinct methods can be applied to determine the number of reactions taking place during the @xmath0-irradiation .",
    "the first method is based on the on - line detection of the outgoing particle .",
    "this method has been successfully applied only for ( @xmath0,n ) reactions because charged particle emitting reactions have typically lower cross section and the detection of the resulting low yields in a high @xmath0-flux environment requires special experimental technique .",
    "the other method is photoactivation , where the cross section is determined from the off - line measurement of the induced activity of the irradiated target .",
    "this method is , of course , only applicable when the product nucleus is radioactive , but owing to its technical advantages the majority of the @xmath0-process related photodisintegration measurements have been carried out with this technique .",
    "further details of the in - beam and activation methods will be discussed in connection with the charged particle induced reaction cross section measurements in .",
    "all the above mentioned experimental techniques can only be applied to stable target nuclei . for the @xmath0-process ,",
    "however , photon - induced reactions on proton - rich unstable isotopes are also important .",
    "these reactions can in principle be studied in inverse kinematics by the coulomb dissociation method .",
    "coulomb dissociation is a well known technique , and is , e.g. , being studied at the gsi helmholtz center for heavy ion research in darmstadt , germany , with the land ( large array neutron detector ) setup .",
    "results for @xmath323mo(@xmath324 ) have been published recently , the analysis for @xmath30mo(@xmath324 ) is ongoing @xcite .",
    ".[tab : gammaexp ] experimentally studied @xmath0-induced reactions relevant for the @xmath0-process .",

    "a similar research program has been initiated recently at the university of notre dame , usa . the studied isotopes , as well as some parameters of the experiments , are listed in .",
    "the measured angular distributions can be compared with predictions using different optical potential parameterizations .",
    "global optical potentials ( i.e. , potentials that are designed for broad mass and energy regions ) are preferred since they can be used in extended @xmath0-process networks .",
    "several global potentials are available in literature , for a list see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is found that different potentials often lead to largely different angular distributions and by comparison with the measured data the one with the best match can be selected .",
    "more sensitive analyses can be performed when the ratio of the measured cross sections of two isotopes studied at the same energy is calculated and compared to the corresponding ratio given by global potentials .",
    "such a comparison has been carried out , e.g. , for the @xmath325sn ( @xmath21 ) and the @xmath326cd ( @xmath327 ) isotopes , and the @xmath328y , @xmath17mo ( @xmath18 ) isotones .",
    "none of the available global potentials seem to describe well the cross section ratios , clearly indicating the need for improved potential parameterizations at low energies .",
    "in addition to the comparison with global potentials , the measured angular distributions can also be used to constrain some parameters relevant for the given isotope . by fitting the measured cross sections using various approaches , such as woods - saxon parameterizations or double folding potentials ,",
    "local optical potential parameters can be obtained . by studying several isotopes , the evolution of the best fit potential parameters",
    "can also be investigated .",
    "if the angular distribution is measured in an almost complete angular range , total reaction cross sections can be easily obtained by simply calculating the missing flux from the elastic channel @xcite .",
    "the calculated total cross section can then be compared to experimental data , if they are available , or with model predictions @xcite .    the possible appearance of additional reaction channels at low energy , such as the coulomb excitation introduced in complicate the interpretation of the scattering data for @xmath60-particles .",
    "if an optical potential is derived from scattering data at an energy where compound nucleus formation is the dominant reaction mechanism , its absorptive part will only account for this loss of @xmath60-flux from the elastic channel .",
    "when the extrapolated potential is then used at lower energies at which low - energy coulomb excitation ( or any other additional mechanism ) acts , it will underestimate the inelastic ( reaction ) cross section at these energies .",
    "nevertheless , it may be correctly describing the compound formation probability and thus will be appropriate for calculating stellar ( @xmath0,@xmath60 ) rates , as explained in .",
    "if an optical potential , on the other hand , is derived from scattering data for energies at which the additional mechanism is non - negligible , its absorptive part will include this additional mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , this does not help by itself in the application to the stellar rate , as the compound formation cross section is not constrained separately .",
    "this would only be possible by using additional theory , i.e. , by calculating the expected cross section for the additional mechanism ( e.g. , coulomb excitation ) and then adjusting the absorption in the optical potential in such a way that it yields a flux into inelastic channels that is the original one subtracted by the one going into the direct channel .",
    "most likely , such a modification will introduce additional parameters .",
    "regardless of the possible complications at low energies , precise low - energy elastic @xmath60-scattering experiments can provide useful information to better understand the optical potential behavior at astrophysical energies and further experiments are needed .",
    "neutron captures in astrophysics have been comprehensively studied along stability for s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "a series of publications has compiled the data and provided recommended values @xcite .",
    "these focussed , however , on the energy range relevant for the s - process which is at lower energies than required in the @xmath0-process . for many of the quoted reactions cross sections",
    "are not even available across the s - process energy range , as only macs at 25 kev were studied .",
    "quasi - stellar neutron spectra at @xmath329 kev ( which is close to the dominant s - process temperature ) were produced .",
    "when an energy - dependence was required , renormalized theoretical cross sections were used .",
    "as mentioned in , it was shown only recently how to correctly account for stellar effects in the renormalization .",
    "the newly renormalized reactivities as function of @xmath330 , obtained by application of are given in @xcite .",
    "as has been pointed out in , almost no data is available for @xmath0-process energies .",
    "this includes cross sections from major libraries ( e.g. , endf / b @xcite , jeff @xcite , jendl @xcite ) which are based on theoretical values .",
    "a cross - comparison is made difficult by the fact that different , partly undocumented calculations were adopted . even within a given library ,",
    "different reaction codes were used .",
    "renormalized theory values could in principle also be used to cover the energy range up to several hundreds of kev , as required for the @xmath0-process .",
    "this has two disadvantages , however .",
    "firstly , it is not always clear whether the statistical model , used for cross section predictions , is applicable at low energy , where data is available . if not",
    ", the renormalization should rather be performed at a higher energy . secondly , according to and realizing that g.s .",
    "contributions are small at @xmath0-process temperatures ( see , e.g. , ) , it turns out that reactivities at higher temperature are not constrained strongly by the experimental data .",
    "this may also discourage direct measurements at @xmath0-process energies but nevertheless can such data be used to test theoretical reaction models for g.s .",
    "reactivities , as it is done for reactions with charged particles .",
    "the only way to obtain laboratory reactivities for higher temperatures is to provide cross section measurements covering the astrophysical energy region .",
    "similar as for the study of charged - particle reactions described in , activation of target material can be used or in - beam measurements at time - of - flight facilities can be performed . also , a combination of ams ( ) and activation can be applied . when using activation techniques it is crucial not to apply maxwellian neutron spectra .",
    "such neutron spectra are only useful when the g.s .",
    "contribution is large and the stellar rate can be measured directly .",
    "this is not the case for neutron captures in the @xmath0-process .",
    "a number of neutron time - of - flight facilities have contributed to astrophysical measurements in the past , among them the oak ridge electron linear accelerator ( orela ) , usa ; a similar facility , gelina , at the irmm in geel , belgium ; the dance setup at the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) . also dedicated to astrophysical measurements",
    ", the ntof facility at cern has been very productive in recent years .",
    "the facility uses high energy protons impinging on a lead spallation target to produce a pulsed neutron beam .",
    "a large neutron energy range and a high instantaneous neutron flux combined with high resolution due to the long neutron flightpath are among the key characteristics of the facility .",
    "since 2010 , the experimental area has been modified to allow the extension of the physics program to include neutron - induced reactions on radioactive isotopes @xcite .",
    "this facility would also be well suited to provide the data required for calculating laboratory reactivities for neutron captures in the @xmath0-process .",
    "a new facility with focus on nuclear astrophysics , the frankfurt neutron source ( franz ) , is under construction at the university of frankfurt @xcite .",
    "it will provide the highest neutron flux in the kev region worldwide and therefore again be best suited for neutron capture in the s - process .",
    "the study of neutron captures on unstable nuclei at radioactive ion beam facilities using inverse kinematics is not possible due to the unavailability of a neutron target .",
    "see for a discussion of the application of ( d , p ) reactions instead .",
    "it has been pointed out in that it is useful to study transitions to excited states in the final nucleus through particle emission .",
    "this way , transitions appearing due to the thermal excitation of states in the stellar plasma can be investigated .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering , i.e. , ( n , n ) , provides another approach to achieve this .",
    "for example , inelastic neutron scattering has been used to probe neutron transitions in @xmath315os .",
    "measurements with astrophysical motivation were performed , e.g. , at orela @xcite and at ntof @xcite .",
    "this nucleus is of interest because of its importance in the re - os cosmochronometer @xcite . due to low - lying excited states",
    ", it has a non - negligible contribution of excited state transitions to the stellar rate already at s - process temperatures .    using ( n",
    ", n ) at higher energies for the @xmath0-process would be even more important ( and an interesting complement to neutron capture measurements ) because of the even larger stellar effects .",
    "an interesting alternative to studying low - energy @xmath60-transitions is the use of ( n,@xmath60 ) reactions , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "there is a number of reasons for this . except at threshold , the reaction cross sections are sensitive to the @xmath60-width and therefore to the optical @xmath60+nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that , when using stable target nuclei , the q - values of ( n,@xmath60 ) reactions on nuclei in the mass range relevant to the @xmath0-process are such that the relative energies of the emitted @xmath60-particles are in the astrophysically interesting energy range .",
    "it is further advantageous that the neutron energy can be varied to probe the energy dependence of the @xmath60+nucleus optical potential .",
    "measuring partial cross sections , i.e. , ( n,@xmath331 ) , ( n,@xmath332 ) , ( n,@xmath333 ) ,  , also allows to probe this energy dependence and to test the prediction of stellar excitation effects .",
    "the small cross sections expected for low neutron energies , from a few to a few hundred kev , may be problematic .",
    "using predicted cross sections and scaling sample sizes of previous measurements , it was estimated that as many as 30 nuclides across a wide range of masses should be accessible to measurements @xcite .",
    "so far , ( n,@xmath60 ) on @xmath334nd @xcite and on @xmath105sm @xcite have been measured at neutron energies below 1 mev .",
    "neutron energies of several mev have been applied in the recent measurements of ( n,@xmath60 ) on @xmath334nd @xcite , @xmath105sm @xcite , and @xmath335sm @xcite .",
    "such experiments also provide an excellent possibility for complementary studies to clarify the coulomb excitation effect suggested to explain the result of the @xmath19sm(@xmath60,@xmath0)@xmath179gd measurement ( see sections [ sec : direct ] , [ sec : sensi ] , and ) .",
    "no additional reduction of the cross section should be observed in @xmath60-emission .",
    "although a measurement of @xmath105gd(n,@xmath60)@xmath19sm is impossible , it is interesting that the measured ( n,@xmath60 ) cross sections of the nd and sm isotopes are consistently about a factor of @xmath244 below the predictions obtained with several codes .",
    "this is in line with the factor of three discrepancy remaining in the @xmath19sm(@xmath60,@xmath0 ) case _ after _ correcting for coulomb excitation and can be attributed to deficiences in the description of the optical potential alone .",
    "the facilities listed in , also those focussing on low neutron energies , could also be used for such ( n,@xmath60 ) studies in the future .",
    "we have come a long way since @xcite but the mystery of the origin of the p - nuclides is still with us .",
    "modern models of low - mass stars show strong s - process contributions to several nuclei previously considered to be p - nuclei",
    ". detailed models of nucleosynthesis in massive stars , coupling large reaction networks to the hydrodynamic evolution of the star , have confirmed the working of the @xmath0-process , synthesizing p - nuclei through photodisintegration .",
    "supplementing such photodisintegration with neutrino processes required in the production of @xmath11la and @xmath12ta explains the bulk of the p - abundances .",
    "deficiencies are found at higher mass , @xmath336 , and for light p - nuclei with @xmath337 . while nuclear reactions are uncertain in the high mass part and further developments of theory and additional experimental data are needed there , the severe underproduction of the light p - nuclei is a long - standing problem and may point to a principle difficulty encountered when trying to obtain light p - nuclei from massive stars .",
    "therefore a number of alternatives have been suggested and some have been studied in detail recently .",
    "consistent hydrodynamical and nucleosynthetic treatment are still missing , however .",
    "meteoritic specimens provide strong constraints for any new process under investigation and thus partially circumvent the problem that p - isotopic abundances can not be determined from stellar spectra .",
    "they also allow to invoke gce models providing further constraints .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in the astrophysical modeling of the sites possibly producing p - nuclei , a sound base of nuclear reaction rates is essential for all such investigations .",
    "as long as an experimental determination of the rates around the deflection points is impossible , measurements of low energy cross sections of stable nuclides are essential to test and improve the theoretical calculations .",
    "this has been underlined by the recent results regarding optical potentials for the interaction of charged nuclei .",
    "further measurements ( at even lower energy ) are highly desireable but have to be designed carefully , taking into account the astrophysically relevant energy ranges , sensitivities of stellar rates to nuclear input , and the principally possible contribution of the laboratory cross section to the stellar rate . combining continuing nuclear physics efforts , both in experiment and theory , with improved , self - consistent hydrodynamic simulations of the possible production sites will gradually improve our understanding of p - nucleosynthesis .",
