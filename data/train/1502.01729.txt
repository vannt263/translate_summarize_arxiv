    "many elementary problems in geometric combinatorics ask how often a particular type of point configuration can occur in subsets of some ambient space .",
    "one of the most famous is the erds single distance problem , which asks how often any fixed distance can occur in a large finite set of points in the plane .",
    "the conjecture is that for a set of @xmath3 points , no distance can occur more than @xmath4 times , for some constant @xmath5 , independent of @xmath3 , and any @xmath6 .",
    "the best known estimate of this is due to spencer , szemer ` edi , and trotter , in @xcite , who have shown that @xmath7 is an upper bound .",
    "a closely related problem , the erds distinct distances problem , asks for a lower bound on the number of distinct distances determined by point pairs from a large finite point set .",
    "this was resolved in the plane by guth and katz , in @xcite .",
    "analogous questions have been studied for dot products ; see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    here , we consider triples of points which determine a pair of dot products in large finite point sets . in the settings of vector spaces over various finite rings",
    ", there has been activity on the special case of zero dot products by the second listed author , and iosevich @xcite , as well as pham and vinh , in @xcite .",

    "that is , for real numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20    we will typically restrict @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be positive nonzero , because zero dot products behave differently , as demonstrated by proposition [ zerodps ] .",

    "as these families of shared lines are parallel for point pairs along @xmath83 , each point , @xmath42 , can be on at most one @xmath18-line , regardless of a possible overlap with a @xmath19-line .",
    "this means that each point @xmath63 can be in at most one triple of the form @xmath86 with a pair of points , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , from @xmath83 .",
    "the total number of triples contributed by pairs of points in @xmath83 is therefore no more than @xmath3 .",
    "as there are no more than @xmath3 points , there can be no more than @xmath3 distinct radial lines to consider .",
    "since each radial line can contribute no more than @xmath3 triples to @xmath25 , the maximum contribution to @xmath25 by pairs in @xmath72 is no more than @xmath87 .",
    "first , we define @xmath18-lines and @xmath19-lines as in the proof of theorem [ general ] .",

    "referring back to the definition of @xmath25 , we see that a triple of points , @xmath75 , will be in @xmath25 precisely when @xmath50 lies on the @xmath18-line of @xmath42 and @xmath51 lies on the @xmath19-line of @xmath42 .",
    "so the quantity we aim to estimate is latexmath:[\\[\\label{bigest }     it follows that we want a bound on the number of times that a point , @xmath88 , is incident to an @xmath18-line or @xmath19-line .",

    "@xmath95    where @xmath96 is defined similarly .",
    "now , if a point has roughly @xmath97 points from @xmath21 on its @xmath18-line , and @xmath98 points from @xmath21 on its @xmath19-line , then it will be in the intersection of @xmath99 and @xmath96 .",
    "let us define these intersections as :    @xmath100    the intersection of any @xmath18-line or @xmath19-line with @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] can be no longer than @xmath101 .",
    "all of our points are contained in @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] , so it will suffice to estimate the maximum number of points of @xmath21 on any line segment of length @xmath102 .",
    "fix such a segment , @xmath103 .",
    "recall the separation condition , @xmath104 so each point on @xmath103 must have a vacant length of segment at least @xmath30 long in either direction .",
    "so if @xmath103 had points packed on it maximally , there would be no more than @xmath105 we can see that for every point @xmath88 , @xmath106 is empty for @xmath107 or @xmath108 bigger than @xmath109 .",
    "this also tells us that for all relevant indices @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the sums to follow , we have : @xmath110    by combining the above : @xmath111    so , for any pair of indices , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we have the following bound latexmath:[\\[\\label{parta }     we now dyadically decompose the sum in as we did with the sum estimating @xmath90 .",

    "to see @xmath119 , notice that any line that yields the prescribed dot products for a given point is perpendicular to that point s radial line . for the @xmath18-line of @xmath50 and @xmath19-line of @xmath51 to be coincidental , they must both be perpendicular to the same radial line , and thus , be generated from two points upon the same radial line .    for @xmath120",
    ", assuming the @xmath18-line of @xmath50 is coincidental to the @xmath19-line of @xmath51 , we get the following two equations of lines in the plane : @xmath121 @xmath122 we know that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are on the same radial line , so there must exist a @xmath123 such that , @xmath124 we set the equations equal to one another and get : @xmath125 by substituting for the coordinates of @xmath50 , @xmath126 after simplifying , we see that @xmath127      there is a small technical obstruction to a direct application of the celebrated szemerdi - trotter point - line incidence theorem , which is that two types of line may be coincident .",
    "this turns out to not be a problem in our case . by appealing to the definitions of @xmath18-line and @xmath19-line",
    ", we can see that no two points can determine the same @xmath18-line or @xmath19-line .",
    "however , as we have seen above , it is possible for the @xmath18-line of a point to overlap the @xmath19-line of a point ( a different point , unless @xmath128 ) .",
    "we prove lemma [ stlemma ] using techniques of sz ' ekely , from @xcite .",
    "draw a graph ( possibly a multigraph ) with the @xmath3 points as vertices , and the segments of the @xmath18-lines and @xmath19-lines connecting adjacent points as edges .",
    "observe that no pair of points can have more than two edges connecting them , and this can only happen if the @xmath18-line of a point is coincident to the @xmath19-line of a point . if this does happen , we can replace the line segments by two curves , whose endpoints are the adjacent points in question , drawn in such a way so as not to cross any more or fewer edges than the initial line segment crossed .    notice that the number of edges contributed by each line is equal to the number of point - line incidences on that line minus one ( for example , if there are seven points on a given line , we would connect consecutive points with six edges . ) .",
    "so the number of edges is equal to the number of incidences minus the number of lines that contribute incidences .",
    "there are exactly @xmath129 lines ( @xmath3 of each type ) that may contribute incidences .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the number of point - line incidences , and @xmath130 denote the number of edges in the graph .",
    "we have that @xmath131    we let @xmath132 denote the _ crossing number of @xmath133 _ , which is the maximum number times that edges of @xmath133 must cross one another at some point which is not a vertex , for any redrawing of @xmath133 .",
