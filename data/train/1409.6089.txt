    "squeezing in an ensemble of two - level systems @xcite is a quantum phenomenon with applications ranging from quantum information @xcite to precision metrology @xcite .",
    "since the canonical two - level system is a spin-@xmath0 particle , this is often referred to as `` spin squeezing '' , but physical realizations include a broad range of systems defined by the same lie algebra , such as two - component becs @xcite or polarized light @xcite .",
    "a seminal paper by kitagawa and ueda @xcite established nonlinear dynamics as a natural way to generate spin - squeezing , via two distinct mechanisms : by one - axis twisting ( oat ) on the bloch sphere with hamiltonian @xmath1 , and two - axis counter - twisting ( tact ) with hamiltonian @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being components of the collective spin operator .",
    "the latter scenario is more efficient in generating strong spin squeezing , however no experiment has achieved it directly , but schemes have been proposed to convert oat into effective tact hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the spin - squeezing hamiltonian quadratic in @xmath3 is part of the more general lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite , an important exactly solvable model introduced to test various many - body approximation methods .",
    "the model is relevant in several fields , including nuclear physics @xcite , quantum criticality and phase transitions @xcite , molecular magnetism @xcite , multi - particle entanglement @xcite and classical bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the broad applicability of the lmg hamiltonian , @xmath4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] arises from the independent variation of the three parameters @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , ultracold atomic systems , with their extreme tunability and control , seem a natural choice for a lmg simulator . but as yet only a limited case with one varied parameter ( keeping @xmath6 fixed ) has been demonstrated with bec @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a way to implement general lmg with independent multi - parameter control as well as direct spin squeezing by both tact and oat , with a bec in a ring trap with periodic angular modulation of the external potential and of the inter - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "two counter - propagating rotational modes act as pseudo - spin coupled by the periodic potential ; and the spatially modulated nonlinearity controls and varies the various components of the twisting tensor @xmath7 in the general quadratic hamiltonian @xmath8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that covers oat , tact , and lmg as special cases @xcite .",
    "our study is also motivated by the rapid advances in recent years in toroidal trapping of ultracold atoms by a variety of ways : by intersecting a  sheet \" beam with a lagueree - gaussian beam @xcite or a beam passed through a ring - shaped mask @xcite , with painted potentials @xcite , and with magnetic waveguides @xcite .",
    "notably , the study of lmg and spin - squeezing provides a distinct new line of study with such traps which have so far been primarily used to examine superfluid flow @xcite and interferometric effects @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ derivation ]",
    "we derive the hamiltonian , in sec . [ spinsqueezing ] spin squeezing by oat and tact",
    "is discussed , in sec [ lmgmodel ] we discuss the lmg model and phase transitions in our scheme , in sec .",
    "[ fastestsqueezing ] we show various features of the spin squeezing procedure under the optimum rotation condition , in sec . [ conditions ] we specify the conditions for physical parameters , in sec . [ stateprep ] we discuss various options for initial state preparation and detection , and we conclude with sec . [ conclusion ] .",
    "some mathematical details are in appendices .",
    "consider a bec of @xmath9 atoms in a toroidal trap with a superimposed potential @xmath10 and spatially varying nonlinearity , with the latter having twice the periodicity of the potential around the ring as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - schematic ] . for example , in a laguerre - gaussian implementation this could be achieved by modulating the amplitudes and phases of the component beams .",
    "the spatially varying nonlinearity can be produced by optically induced feshbach resonance @xcite , as demonstrated for linear geometry in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is driven by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath11 { \\hat{\\psi}}(\\mathbf{r}),{\\nonumber}\\\\ & & { \\rm where}\\ \\ g(\\mathbf{r},t)= \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar^2 a ( \\mathbf{r},t)}{m } \\label{qf - hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the nonlinearity parameter , with @xmath12 being the scattering length , @xmath13 the particle mass , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are , respectively the annihilation and creation bosonic field operators satisfying the commutation relations @xmath16=\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r^\\prime})$ ] .",
    "using cylindrical co - ordinates @xmath17 , with @xmath18 along ring axis , we assume tight harmonic confinement in radial and axial directions @xmath19 with @xmath20 being mean ring radius . the azimuthal potential is taken to be weakly sinusoidal rotating along the ring with frequency @xmath21 , creating a circular bragg grating , @xmath22 + \\hbar u_y \\sin\\left[2q ( \\varphi + \\omega t ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 an integer and amplitudes assumed small , @xmath24 .",
    "the nonlinear parameter is given a periodic spatio - temporal dependence , @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants .",
    "we expand the field operators @xmath29 in terms of the mode functions of the ring trap , @xmath30 being the rms widths of the mode functions in the respective directions . assuming that the tight trapping allows only the ground state to be populated in the axial and radial directions , the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the annihilation and creation operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 as    @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the hamiltonian simplifies further if only two counter - propagating modes with @xmath34 are initially populated , and the energy gap manifest in the diagonal terms inhibits transitions to other modes .",
    "we absorb the time dependence of the fields into the definition of the mode operators , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and we define the pseudo - spin operators @xmath37 @xmath38 the hamiltonian reduces to    @xmath39 \\label{hamj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined effective one - dimensional nonlinear coefficients @xmath40 and dropping a scalar term @xmath41 that creates an irrelevant global phase .",
    "this effective hamiltonian is one of main result of the paper .",
    "additional details of its derivation is provided in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "it is worth noting that although the sign of the unmodulated nonlinear term @xmath42 suggests attractive inter - particle interaction , it actually stems from repulsive interaction for positive @xmath26 .",
    "this apparent contradiction stems from the fact that for @xmath43 the counter - rotating modes @xmath44 and @xmath45 are almost equally populated and the condensate forms a standing wave with pronounced interference fringes ( see fig .",
    "[ f - schematic ] ) . therefore , the particles are effectively compressed to half of the volume that would be occupied if they were all circulating in the same direction ( @xmath46 ) with no interference fringes .",
    "thus , states with larger @xmath47 correspond to lower interaction energy .",
    "the terms linear in @xmath37 generate rotation on the bloch sphere with angular velocity vector @xmath48 .",
    "spin squeezing is generated by nonlinear terms the coefficients of which can be written as a _ twisting _",
    "tensor @xcite : @xmath49 since @xmath50 , adding multiples of a unit matrix to @xmath7 only leads to a trivial global phase . for @xmath51 ( no spatial modulation of the nonlinearity ) the position of the bec interference fringes plays no role .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to rotations around @xmath52 , and the nonlinear dynamics corresponds to oat . when @xmath53 the nonlinearity is modulated , and the interaction energy is affected by the relative positions of the interference fringes and the maxima of the nonlinearity ( see fig .",
    "[ f - schematic ] ) . in this case",
    "the twisting tensor has eigenvalues @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the maximum squeezing rate is determined by the difference between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the twisting tensor @xcite . for positive @xmath56 and states that are nearly gaussian and optimally positioned on the bloch sphere , on the axis of the middle eigenvalue , the maximum squeezing rate is @xmath57 where the squeezing parameter @xmath58 is defined as the ratio of the minimum variance of the uncertainty ellipse of the state and the variance of the spin coherent state .",
    "appendix [ appendixb ] provides more details about the squeezing . to achieve this maximum rate ,",
    "the state should be centered on the bloch sphere along the axis corresponding to the middle eigenvalue , and kept optimally oriented by continuous rotation of the system at frequency @xmath59 around this axis , where @xmath60 are the eigenvalues in ascending order ; here , if @xmath61 , this frequency is @xmath62 .    in the special case",
    "when the middle eigenvalue is exactly between the other two eigenvalues , @xmath7 can be transformed to a diagonal form diag@xmath63 corresponding to tact ( see @xcite for details ) ; here @xmath64 is the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalues . in our model",
    "it corresponds to the condition @xmath65 .",
    "since the modulation maxima and minima are proportional to @xmath66 , the maximum and minimum are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , so that tact occurs if the maximum value of the modulated nonlinearity is five times larger than the minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ f - schematic ] ) . in this case",
    ", the state naturally remains optimally oriented , no rotation is needed .",
    "special cases of our hamiltonian ( [ hamj ] ) correspond to various instances of the lmg model .",
    "for example , setting @xmath69 leads to lmg model with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , and setting @xmath73 leads to lmg model with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 with the roles of the coordinates in @xmath77 permutated @xmath78 .    to illustrate the applicability of our hamiltonian to the lmg model",
    ", we show a possible lmg phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ f - phasediag1 ] . in this example , we assume @xmath79 and @xmath80 , varying @xmath81 and @xmath82 . such a choice may be natural , for instance , if one needs to avoid rotation of the fields .",
    "the zones denoted i ",
    "iv correspond to those studied in @xcite , reflecting different qualitative behavior of the energy surfaces and different properties of the density of eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "crossing the boundary between various zones corresponds to various phase transitions ; for example crossing from i to ii by decreasing @xmath83 with @xmath51 corresponds to the classical bifurcation at the transition from rabi to josephson dynamics observed in @xcite .      the conditions for fastest squeezing can be achieved with the parameters used for the lmg phase diagram above .",
    "the state is positioned along @xmath84 axis on the bloch sphere and rotation @xmath82 should be applied at the optimum frequency defined earlier .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled by parameters of the red broken line between points a  d in fig .",
    "[ f - phasediag1 ] .",
    "we show the corresponding time evolution of the squeezing parameter @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ f - timevol1 ] .",
    "the best squeezing properties correspond to tact ( line d ) and as can be seen , even a relatively small deviation of the tact condition leads to a strong deterioration of squeezing in the last stages ( line c ) .      for the respective parameter values",
    "we also show the density of states @xmath85 as a function of the hamiltonian eigenvalues @xmath86 with qualitatively different shapes in zone ii ( one peak ) and iii ( two peaks that merge in the limit of tact , point d of fig .",
    "[ f - phasediag1 ] ) .",
    "the peaks divide the energy spectrum into regions with qualitatively different features of the hamiltonian eigenstates . as an interesting relationship between squeezing and lmg phase we note that the states undergoing squeezing with the optimum rotation are located at one of the density peaks .",
    "we illustrate this feature in a few figures . in fig .",
    "[ f - eigenenergs1 ] we show the eigenvalues for the hamiltonian from eq .",
    "( [ hamj ] ) as a function of @xmath87 with the remaining parameters fixed at @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and choosing @xmath91 for fastest squeezing .",

    "the histogram in fig .",
    "[ f - eigenenergs1 ] shows the probabilities of the individual eigenstates for @xmath93 . the spread ( twice the energy uncertainty @xmath94 ) of the histogram corresponds to separation of the two red lines mentioned above , and the correspond gap for @xmath95 equals the width of vertical red bars in the spectral densities plotted in the insets of fig .",
    "[ f - timevol1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ f - qfunctions1 ] we show the @xmath96-functions of the hamiltonian eigenstates in the vicinity of the peak of the energy spectrum , for a fixed value of @xmath93 with all the other parameters the same as in fig .  [ f - eigenenergs1 ] , and the fastest squeezing condition yields @xmath97 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f - qfunctions1 ] , the density peak divides the spectrum into qualitatively different regions .",
    "states with energy below the peak are doubly degenerate and their @xmath96-functions form two rings encircling the poles .",
    "states with energy above the peak have @xmath96-functions following a single curve similar to a tennis - ball seam .",
    "the transition between these two regimes at the spectral peak contains pillow - shaped and x - shaped structures .",
    "the highlighted panels in fig .",
    "[ f - qfunctions1 ] show eigenstates involved in the superposition being squeezed .",
    "one can understand the squeezing process under the optimum rotation condition as gradually forming destructive interference of one diagonal pair of corners of the pillow - shaped and x - shaped structures , and constructive interference of the other pair of corners .",
    "snapshots of the time evolution of the superposition state being squeezed is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - qfunctions2 ] as the squeezing is generated , up to a time beyond when maximum squeezing is achieved .",
    "the evolution is confined to the tangential degree of freedom if the radial and axial confinement is sufficiently tight so that occupation of higher modes of these degrees of freedom is energetically forbidden .",
    "this is achieved if @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the atomic de broglie wavelength along the ring .    to avoid transitions to other circular modes",
    ", the corresponding couplings should be sufficiently small . in the hamiltonian ( [ hama ] )",
    "the terms with @xmath100 couple modes @xmath34 also to unwanted modes @xmath101",
    ". the probability of such transitions would oscillate with small magnitude near zero provided that the couplings are much smaller than the energy difference of the coupled states , namely @xmath102 this condition puts a lower bound on the time during which the system can complete a @xmath103-flip between the @xmath104 states : @xmath105 for rubidium atoms in visible light , @xmath106s , so the flipping time would take at least @xmath107 @xmath108s .",
    "the nonlinear term in hamiltonian ( [ hama ] ) couples the modes @xmath34 to other modes @xmath109 for which the condition @xmath110 ( homogeneous part @xmath111 ) or @xmath112 ( inhomogeneous part @xmath87 ) is satisfied .",
    "if , say mode @xmath113 is occupied with @xmath9 atoms and the remaining modes are empty , then the energetically closest state satisfying this condition corresponds to @xmath114 atoms in mode @xmath23 and one atom in each of the modes @xmath115 .",
    "the energy difference between these two states is @xmath116 .",
    "thus , to avoid such transitions , the nonlinear coupling should satisfy @xmath117 setting limits on the shortest time during which useful squeezing can be produced @xmath118 much longer than the rotational period of the superposition of two lowest - energy eigenstates of the ring trap .",
    "assuming rubidium in a ring trap with @xmath119 one finds @xmath120 ms .",
    "the process must be performed before losses become significant . with @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,",
    "the peak atomic density @xmath123 @xmath124 and the dominant mechanism of losses are inelastic collisions .",
    "recent experiments with combined magnetic and optical @xcite and purely optical feshbach resonance @xcite report suppressing inelastic loss rates to @xmath125 @xmath126/s , i.e. , the requirements are just on the edge of present experimental possibilities . full demonstration of these effects would require further suppression of @xmath127 that can be expected , e.g. , from dark - state - like interferences by means of multiphoton transitions in combined optical fields @xcite .",
    "more detailed treatment of the problem of squeezing with losses and finite temperature can be found in @xcite .",
    "a spin coherent state can be prepared by rotating a bec with the chosen winding number @xmath23 .",
    "one way to do that is via raman transition to transfer the angular momentum from lg beams to a non - rotating bec @xcite .",
    "the resulting state is an eigenstate of @xmath128 with eigenvalue @xmath129 .",
    "any other spin coherent state can be prepared from this state by application of operators @xmath37 , by varying the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath21 to rotate the state on the bloch sphere .    for detection @xmath37 , the procedure can be reversed : first the state is rotated so that the operator of interest corresponds to @xmath128 , then a raman process converts the @xmath131 eigenstate to a non - rotating bec .",
    "finally the proportion of the non - rotating atoms is measured ; for the setup in ref .",
    "@xcite this can be done by releasing the condensate and observing the size of the central hole in the interference pattern produced by the free - falling atoms . alternately , one can measure @xmath128 by coupling the ring resonator to a linear atomic waveguide ( formed , e.g. , by a red - detuned horizontal laser beam ) positioned tangentially near the ring .",
    "atoms circulating in the opposite orientations would leak to the waveguide and propagate in opposite directions towards the waveguide ends where they can be detected .",
    "we have shown that a bec in a toroidal trap with a circular lattice and a spatially modulated nonlinearity can be used to realize a general lmg model and comprehensive spin - squeezing procedures , including direct two - axes twisting ; with independent control over all the relevant parameters .",
    "our model should be useful for creating squeezed states for quantum measurements and testing critical phenomena in a range of physical systems described by the lmg model .",
    "it also provides a different realm of physics to be explored with the rapidly advancing technology of toroidal trapping of ultracold atoms .",
    "we conclude with some comments about our model : unlike most schemes for bosonic pseudospin squeezing @xcite , it can directly generate rotation about an arbitrary bloch axis by varying @xmath130 and @xmath21",
    ". any relevant ratio of the lmg parameters can be achieved by co - ordinate rotation , if @xmath87 can access @xmath132 $ ] or @xmath133 $ ] .",

    "<S> we propose a scheme for spin - squeezing in the orbital motion of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a toroidal trap . </S>",
    "<S> a circular lattice couples two counter - rotating modes and squeezing is generated by the nonlinear interaction spatially modulated at half the lattice period . by varying the amplitude and phase of the modulation , </S>",
    "<S> various cases of the twisting tensor can be directly realized , leading to different squeezing regimes . </S>",
    "<S> these include one - axis twisting and the two - axis counter - twisting which are often discussed as the most important paradigms for spin squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme naturally realizes the lipkin - meshkov - glick model with the freedom to vary all its parameters simultaneously . </S>"
