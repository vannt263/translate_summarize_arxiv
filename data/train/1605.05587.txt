    "bistable switches are a common regulatory motif in biological processes .",
    "they consist of cross - repressing components that generate a switch - like transition between two possible states . in developing tissues , bistable switches , created by cross repressing transcriptional determinants ,",
    "are often controlled by gradients of secreted signalling molecules - morphogens .",
    "these provide a mechanism to convert a morphogen gradient into stripes of gene expression that determine the arrangement of distinct cell types . here",
    "we use mathematical models to analyse the temporal response of such a system .",
    "we find that the behaviour is highly dependent on the intrinsic fluctuations that result from the stochastic nature of gene expression .",
    "this noise has a marked effect on both patterning time and the location of the stripe boundary .",
    "one of the techniques , minimum action path theory , identifies key features of the switch without computationally expensive calculations .",
    "the results reveal a noise driven switching wave that propels the stripe boundary away from the morphogen source to eventually settle , at steady state , further from the morphogen source than in the deterministic description . together",
    "the analysis highlights the importance dynamics in patterning and demonstrates a set of mathematical tools for studying this problem .",
    "tissue development relies on the spatially and temporally organized allocation of cell identity , with each cell adopting an identity appropriate for its position within the tissue . in many cases ,",
    "these cellular decisions are made by transcriptional networks controlled by extrinsic signals @xcite .",
    "these signals , usually termed morphogens , spread from a localized source within , or adjacent to , the developing tissue to form a spatial gradient that becomes the patterning axis of the tissue .",
    "cells are sensitive to the level of the morphogen and respond by producing a set of discrete gene expression stripes at different distances from the morphogen source @xcite .",
    "a transcriptional mechanism capable of the analogue to digital conversion necessary to transform the continuous morphogen gradient into distinct domains of gene expression is the so - called _ genetic toggle switch _ @xcite .",
    "this network motif , present in many biological contexts , consists of cross - repression between sets of transcriptional determinants that are expressed mutually exclusively in alternative cell identities @xcite .",
    "thus the expression of one set of factors represses the alternative identity and vice versa , creating a bistable switch @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been extensively studied as a way for cells to make decisions and produce distinct outputs in response to biological signals @xcite . in the case of tissue patterning",
    ", a morphogen gradient can modulate the transcription rates of one or more genes that comprise the switch .",
    "this controls the position along the patterning axis at which the switch creates a boundary between cell identities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the principle can be extended to incorporate multiple morphogen controlled toggle switches , each producing a boundary at a distinct position , hence explaining the multiple stripes of gene expression generated in a tissue @xcite    mathematical models of morphogen - controlled toggle switches that reproduce the ultrasensitivity necessary to create discrete gene expression boundaries also generate a temporal sequence of gene expression , prior to reaching steady state , that recapitulates the final spatial pattern @xcite .",
    "this sequence and its timing is a consequence of the inherent dynamical properties of the bistable switch @xcite .",
    "strikingly , the temporal behaviour predicted by the models corresponds to experimental observations of gene expression timing in several developing tissues @xcite and has led to the suggestion that it explains temporal features of morphogen controlled tissue patterning @xcite .    despite the apparent agreement between mathematical models and experimental observations , whether the models correctly identify the biological mechanism responsible for the dynamics and boundary positioning in morphogen - patterned tissues remains unclear . in particular , current models ( excepting @xcite ) are deterministic and have not addressed whether stochastic fluctuations that arise from noisy gene expression qualitatively alter the behaviour of morphogen - controlled toggle switches .",
    "fluctuations in the production and degradation rates of mrna and protein molecules in individual cells can lead to substantial molecular heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "moreover , genes switch between active and inactive states resulting in bursts of transcription interspersed by refractory periods in which transcription is suppressed @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic variations introduced by these processes could facilitate spontaneous transitions between different cell states , see for example @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effect of stochastic fluctuations on the position and precision of boundaries needs to be explored as previous work has suggested , counter - intuitively , that noise can sharpen boundaries in a tissue @xcite .",
    "thus in addition to the effect of gene expression noise on the steady state of a genetic toggle switch , understanding how stochastic fluctuations influence the temporal behaviour of switching along a morphogen patterning axis is necessary .",
    "here we develop a theoretical framework to investigate the dynamics of morphogen - controlled genetic toggle switches and analyse how noise in gene expression affects tissue patterning by this mechanism .",
    "we show that exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions , the corresponding chemical langevin equation , and minimum action path theory provide insight into the trajectory , dynamics and directionality of stochastic switching between states of a bistable switch .",
    "the analysis predicts that intrinsic fluctuations diminish the influence of dynamical ghosts on the temporal evolution of the system so that they no longer dominate the time scale of pattern formation .",
    "moreover , a new steady state position of the pattern boundary is predicted by the stochastic models , which is distinct from that suggested by deterministic analyses . this new boundary position is the consequence of a patterning wave that propagates along the pattering axis of the tissue and sharpens as it advances . the velocity and precision of this moving boundary",
    "are determined by intrinsic noise properties , controlled in the model by the typical number of proteins in the system and production burst sizes . moreover",
    ", boundary propagation can be very slow and in some cases would not be expected to reach steady state in a biologically relevant time .",
    "thus our analysis emphasizes the importance dynamical transients for understanding patterning processes and illustrates a theoretical toolkit to explore these questions .",
    "in order to characterise the dynamics of a bistable switch we consider a model in which two genes @xmath0 and @xmath1 repress each other , and a morphogen signal @xmath2 acts as an activator of gene @xmath0 promoting its expression ( fig .",

    "this mechanism can be readily extended to accommodate additional stripes at different morphogen levels@xcite .    even in the simple scenario ,",

    "one contributor to the stochastic nature of gene expression is the inherent pulsatility of transcription / translation  so - called bursty expression  which results in sporadic interspersed periods of expression and quiescence @xcite .",
    "the framework we have developed allows us to explore the effect of the size of these bursts of expression , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , on the behaviour of the system whilst keeping the deterministic dynamical landscape constant .",
    "the action is independent of @xmath48 but is dependent on the burst sizes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which hence alter the map .",
    "the map approach is therefore suitable for capturing the differences in the effects of different noise sources .",
    "intuitively , a larger burst size will introduce more noise in the expression of a protein and therefore facilitate a transition .",
    "this is confirmed quantitatively by comparing the actions of both switching processes ( figs .",
    "[ mapnua ] and ) , which reveals a reduction in the actions as @xmath53 and @xmath54 increase . in the particular case of fig .",
    "[ mapnua ] , the reduction in action for the transition a to b is much greater than the reduction in action for the reverse transition . whether changes in burst size can modify the directionality of transitions therefore warranted investigation .",
    "perturbations in the shape of the map are also evident ( fig .",
    "[ mapnua ] and ) , suggesting that the greater the burst size of @xmath0 the less activation of @xmath1 is necessary for the repression of a. equivalently , the greater the burst size of @xmath1 , the less activation of a is necessary to repress b. this suggests that changes in @xmath53 and @xmath54 produce contrasting effects on the genetic profiles during switching .",
    "by contrast , a homogeneous increase in the noise , through a reduction in the typical number of molecules @xmath48 , does not result in changes in the switching path .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the effect of the burst sizes on the action profiles reveals that the approximate effect of an increase in burst size is to reduce both actions by a factor which is homogeneous across the tissue ( figs .",
    "[ fig.actionsnub ] and ) .",
    "this has the effect that , where @xmath97 is larger than @xmath96 , the reduction in @xmath101 as burst size increases is greater . by contrast , increases in burst size result in greater reduction in @xmath96 where @xmath96 is larger .",
    "therefore , curiously , the burst parameters do not affect the directionality of the transitions , since they reduce the actions by the same amount at the steady state boundary position . at lower values of the morphogen signal ,",
    "state b is still favoured , as at higher values is state a. thus different burst sizes produce different action profiles along the tissue ( fig .",
    "[ fig.actionsnub ] ) and these will be translated into different transients and precisions of the boundary , but the steady state position of the boundary remains the same .     *",
    "burst size modifies the change in action along the tissue . *",
    "the action along the tissue is evaluated for different values of @xmath54 for both switching transitions : @xmath94 ( solid line ) and @xmath95 ( dashed lines ) , and its derivative over the morphogen concentration ( bottom panel ) .",
    "increasing the morphogen biases the cells towards state a. parameters are those of fig .",
    "[ fig.transientprofilenoise ] . ]      the action @xmath97 grows superlinearly as the signal decreases ( fig .",
    "[ mfptaction ] ) , and the stochastic switching time grows exponentially with @xmath48 .",
    "this results in patterning times ( residence time at @xmath1 denoted by @xmath102 ) that grow super - exponentially as the signal decreases .",
    "a consequence of this is that patterning time varies dramatically , differing by orders of magnitude , along the bistable zone .",
    "this can result in switching times much larger than those relevant to biological processes , in which case the steady state would never be reached .",
    "such a big difference allows the separation of the bistable zone into two regions at any time @xmath103 during the transient : an area where the stochastic switching time towards state a is much smaller than the current time , @xmath104 , ( this region expresses predominantly @xmath0 ) ; and an area where the switching time towards state a is much larger than the current time , @xmath105 , ( this region expresses predominantly @xmath1 ) .",
    "the very large variation of @xmath102 along the gradient @xmath2 allows this separation , since the area of the tissue where @xmath106 is small . at different times",
    "the boundary between these two behaviours will be located at different spatial positions .",
    "specifically , the boundary will be located at positions corresponding with values of the signal where switching time coincides with the current time @xmath107 , _",
    "i.e. _ a value of the signal @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "thus , a bistable switch will produce a pattern boundary that advances away from the morphogen source with a velocity    @xmath110    where , as described above , for large enough number of proteins ( large @xmath48 ) , the result is independent of the prefactor @xmath76 .",
    "the boundary velocity ( [ eq.velocity ] ) can therefore be determined by the value of @xmath48 and by the dependence of the action on the signal , which is readily computed numerically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.actionsnub ] ) .",
    "the greater the typical number of proteins , the slower the advance will be and in the deterministic limit ( @xmath50 ) , the boundary velocity vanishes .",
    "the velocity of the advancing boundary ( [ eq.velocity ] ) decreases in time and the rate of this deceleration is given by the terms @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where the absolute value of this second term increases as the boundary propagates . as a result",
    ", the boundary can appear static for short periods of time , only revealing its movement when tracked for several orders of magnitude in time ( figs .",
    "[ fig.patternshift ] and [ fig.patterntime ] ) .",
    "this is relevant for biological time scales , where a slowly travelling boundary may appear fixed .",
    "the position of the boundary at any time will be determined by @xmath48 and the change of the action with the signal .",
    "the travelling boundary induced by a graded morphogen signal can also be observed in stochastic simulations implemented on an array of cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig.patternshift ] ) .",
    "moreover , for each value of signal at each time point , the standard deviation in @xmath35 between cells for each value of @xmath2 can be measured , this gives an estimate of boundary precision .",
    "as expected the maximum variation is at the boundary @xmath108 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.patternshift ] ) . even at this position",
    ", however , the majority of individual cells are decisive , residing in either an a or b state and relatively few cells are in undefined / transition states where @xmath113 ( fig . [ fig.patterntime ] ) .",
    "the decisiveness of individual cells is a consequence of the relatively rapid transition between states once initiated , compared with the stochastic switching time scale .",
    "thus stochasticity results in a salt and pepper distribution of cell identities close to the boundary .",
    "the sharpness of the boundary during the transient at a time @xmath103 is determined by the size of the zone where @xmath106 , and will therefore increase its precision with @xmath48 ( [ eq.maptime ] ) .",
    "this indicates a trade - off between the sharpness of the boundary and the velocity towards the steady state ( ) .",
    "the larger @xmath48 , the more precise the boundary , but the slower the velocity of the boundary along the patterning axis ( ) .",
    "finally , we asked how the burst size @xmath53 affects the dynamics of this travelling wave .",
    "since alterations in @xmath53 produce different transition profiles @xmath114 ( ) , this will affect the velocity of transitions .",
    "specifically , an increase in burst size is predicted to increase the boundary velocity ( fig.[fig.patternshift ] ) . as a result , even though different values of @xmath53 have the same steady state boundary @xmath99 , they will have boundaries that travel along the patterning axis at different velocities .",
    "strikingly , however , it appears ( fig .",
    "[ fig.patternshift ] ) , that the patterning precision , measured as the width of the region with elevated standard deviation in @xmath35 between cells , is unaffected by the burst size , when comparing the patterns at a given time .",
    "this contrasts with the effect of @xmath48 , where a smaller @xmath48 always increases the width of the boundary at any time point in the transient ( ) .     *",

    "bistable toggle switches are a regulatory mechanism employed in many biological systems ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in developing tissues ,",
    "these switches are encoded by cross - repressing transcription factors and are often coupled with spatially graded extracellular morphogen inputs .",
    "this provides a mechanism to convert the spatially continuous information provided by the gradient into discrete , localized stripes of gene expression , with the morphogen input controlling the position of the boundary . to explore the effect of gene expression noise on the dynamics and output of this mechanism we used a suite of mathematical techniques , including numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions , chemical langevin equations , and minimum action path theory",
    "this combination of approaches provided consistent and complementary results .",
    "in particular , the use of minimum action path theory allowed essential properties of the stochastic dynamical system to be accurately estimated without the necessity for computationally expensive stochastic simulations .",
    "the results revealed that cell fate determination occurs at different times along the tissue resulting in a wave of patterning that propagated away from the morphogen source .",
    "intrinsic noise determined both the velocity at which the gene expression boundary moved and its final position in the tissue .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for developmental pattern formation .    in order to understand the role of intrinsic noise",
    ", we first studied the behaviour of the deterministic system where , for a homogeneous tissue expressing @xmath1 , a change in cellular fate towards state a requires a signal exceeding the threshold @xmath59 .",
    "state a is not reached immediately but undergoes a transient with a speed dependent on the signal level @xmath2 .",
    "a signature of the bistable switch is that , at the threshold @xmath59 , the system undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation , implying that at values of @xmath2 just above @xmath59 , the transient in the deterministic system is very slow @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis indicates that the slow dynamics of the deterministic bistable toggle switch are essentially eliminated by the introduction of stochasticity into gene expression .",
    "in this situation , the fluctuations in gene expression allow a system close to @xmath61 to escape spontaneously from this region of dynamical space , speeding up the cell identity determination in the monostable zone ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "introducing intrinsic fluctuations in gene expression also result in spontaneous switching events between states @xmath1 to @xmath0 within the region of bistability @xmath118 .",
    "the rate of these transitions depends on the noise intensity , and can vary by orders of magnitude along the patterning axis . comparing the effects of stochasticity on the behaviour of a bistable switch in the mono- and bistable zones suggests a trade off between distinct demands on the system .",
    "an increase in noise ( smaller @xmath48 ) allows the system to reach its steady state more swiftly in the monostable zone ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the consequence of this , however , is that the increased noise increases the rate of spontaneous switching in the bistable region and therefore decreases the precision of the gene expression boundary . the importance of speed versus precision will be dictated by the particular biological requirements of the developing tissue .",
    "it is possible that compromises can be found that balance these demands . in this context",
    "it is noteworthy that increases in burst sizes @xmath119 are predicted to accelerate pattern formation without the same deterioration in precision that results from decreasing the system size ( @xmath48 ) , at least at similar time points .",
    "thus enhancing the bursting behaviour of gene expression might be one way to increase the speed of patterning without losing precision .",
    "alternatively , additional mechanisms might be employed to bypass any trade off . in situations",
    "in which a fast , precise pattern is required , differential cell adhesion , or other intercellular communication strategies , could be used to correct patterning mistakes @xcite .",
    "alternatively a morphogen signal that varies in time could be exploited to avoid the dynamical ghost , increasing the speed at which the steady state is approached .",
    "for example , a signal that reaches its peak amplitude rapidly after ligand stimulation and then progressively decreases might effectively bypass or minimise the time the system spends in a dynamical ghost . in this respect , it is notable that two well studied morphogens , tgf@xmath120 and shh , have both been reported to display the type of adapting signaling dynamics that could be well suited to this task .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rates of stochastic switching between the two cellular states change along the gradient with opposite trends . as a result ,",
    "the steady state boundary for the stochastic system is located inside the bistable zone at the point where the rates of switching between the states balance . strikingly , this position is distinct from the one defined by the deterministic system and does not change with increasing values of @xmath48 .",
    "the position is also robust to expression burst size , and is therefore determined by the parameters describing the deterministic switch .",
    "the duration of the transient towards this steady state is defined by the switching times and these vary super - exponentially along the tissue .",
    "this results in a traveling front of switching in which the pattern boundary moves away from the morphogen source .",
    "the velocity of the advancing boundary decreases dramatically as the boundary propagates .",
    "this slowing of the movement means that the gene expression pattern in a tissue might never reach steady state within a biologically realistic time scale . in this scenario",
    "the tissue patterning is always effectively pre - steady state , with a boundary moving so slowly it appears still , but in a different position from the steady state .",
    "the speed of boundary movement is affected by stochastic parameters such as the typical number of proteins @xmath48 or expression bursts size @xmath119 that increase the velocity of boundary propagation even though the nominal steady state position remains constant . taken together therefore , the intrinsic fluctuations in gene expression qualitatively alter the timing and positioning of the boundary , identifying a prominent role for noisy gene expression in pattern formation .    to explore the properties of the stochastic switching , the minimisation of the action proved an efficient strategy .",
    "it provides a much more computationally efficient means to gather information about the stochastic properties of the system than conventional cle or gillespie integrations ( see ) . in the current study ,",
    "the action was computed for the cle ( [ eq.cle ] ) .",
    "action minimisation approaches can be extended to more complex systems such as the full kinetic reaction scheme , or include , for example , the dynamics of mrna production and decay and discrete promoter states @xcite . in cases in which the number of proteins is very small and the eikonal assumption ( [ eq.maptime ] ) fails ,",
    "further expansion in terms of powers of @xmath48 can be used and large deviation principles still hold @xcite .",
    "the principal caveat of action minimisation strategies is the inability to find the prefactor @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even without the prefactor , the action allows time scales to be calculated with logarithmic precision and in many cases this is likely to be sufficient to identify the main patterning properties of biological tissues .",
    "for example we show that the dependence of the action on the level of morphogen allows the estimation of the velocity at which the pattern boundary moves .",
    "the map approach also offers quantitative insight into the transient expression profiles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 during the stochastic switching between cell identities .",
    "the trajectory predicted by the map is distinct from that predicted by the steepest - descent of the deterministic landscape and is shaped by the burst size parameters ( although not the system size parameter @xmath48 ) .",
    "stochastic simulations were consistent with the map , indicating that gene expression during individual cell switching can be predicted even when high levels of stochasticity are introduced .",
    "in this view , the dynamical landscape imposed by the regulatory interactions ensures that as cells transit between states they pass close to the saddle point in gene expression space .",
    "in addition , the transient path is similar in the mono- and bistable region of the system .",
    "this suggests that , in developing tissues , changes in cell identity should be characterized by defined trajectories in the levels of expression of the key genes .",
    "thus even in the presence of gene expression noise , tightly constrained paths between the cell states would be representative of underlying kinetic mechanisms driving the cell state transition .",
    "this is consistent with ideas of developmental canalisation @xcite and leads to experimentally testable predictions that could be assessed using single cell resolution imaging of reporters for the two genes comprising the bistable switch .",
    "observing coordinated changes in gene expression that matched map predictions would support the validity of the map approach and allow key parameters of the biological system to be estimated .",
    "alternatively , even in the absence of live imaging data , it is possible that static data from batches of cells , using techniques such as single cell transcriptomics , might provide experimental tests of the approach .",
    "experimental corroboration of gene expression dynamics characteristic of those predicted by the map would provide insight into the mechanisms controlling cell decisions and greatly strengthen the evidence underpinning the use of dynamical systems theory to model these developmental events .",
    "a practical feature of map theory is that it can be extended to include more complex networks comprising several genes per cellular state .",
    "this would offer insight not only into simple binary decisions , such as that described in this study , but also provide a way to study transitions in more complex and realistic models of cell development @xcite .",
    "thus map theory has the potential to provide a powerful framework to explore and understand the role of noise and dynamics in cell state transitions during normal development and also in other situations such as artificial directed reprogramming experiments @xcite .",
    "more generally , our results emphasise that stochastic fluctuations in gene expression can influence the dynamics and outcome of gene regulatory networks and highlight the importance of developing the mathematical tools to explore these aspects of developmental patterning .",

    "alternatively this is equivalent to redefining the value of @xmath124 . for the comparison in the text , the values used are @xmath125 and @xmath126 which give a sharp boundary that reaches its maximum expression at @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mono ] ) .",
    "the rest of the parameters are the same as the complete bistable switch to facilitate their comparison ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.landscape ] ) .",
    "the case without feedback can not be directly compared with the bistable switch without a proper parameter exploration of both models .",
    "nevertheless it is informative to determine how patterning time depends on the morphogen close to the boundary point @xmath128 .",
    "for the case without positive feedback the expression dynamics are determined by the linear ode , @xmath129 this predicts an exponential decay that for the initial condition @xmath130 is , @xmath131     stationary expression of a without the positive feedback loop for different values of the cooperativity exponent @xmath122 . ]",
    "the minimisation of the action ( [ eq.smin ] ) was performed by discretising the continuous path @xmath79 in n straight segments between positions @xmath132 of duration @xmath133 each . with this approximation ,",
    "the action ( [ eq.action ] ) can be written as , @xmath134 where the index @xmath9 runs over the two genes and @xmath135 over each linear segment of the path . @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the @xmath9th component of the diagonal diffusion tensor ( [ eq.difftens ] ) and the deterministic field ( [ eq.field ] ) for the segment @xmath135 evaluated at its centre @xmath138 . additionally , the velocity along a segment is considered constant @xmath139 . for a certain fixed total time @xmath80 ,",
    "the discretised action ( [ eq.actiondiscrete ] ) can be minimised using a quasi - newtonian method with the help of the analytical expression for the derivative of the action on the direction of the @xmath140-th genetic component of segment point @xmath141,@xmath142\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the derivative in the @xmath140 direction of the @xmath145th component of the diffusion tensor ( [ eq.difftens ] ) and the deterministic field ( [ eq.field ] ) of segment @xmath135 .",
    "the minimisation of the action with @xmath146 degrees of freedom was performed using the lfbgs minimisation strategy .",
    "the resulting value of the action @xmath147 is the minimum action for a certain path time @xmath80 .",
    "the optimal action is found by minimising the resulting @xmath147 with @xmath80 by means of a simple custom made line search method .",
    "since the action here studied is a convex function of the possible paths , the minimisation process does not require an exploration of possible local minima . to speed up the convergence to the solution the starting path consists on two straight lines joining the initial and final phenotype with the saddle point .",
    "the actions for both switching directions @xmath96 and @xmath97 is determined by the boundary conditions of the integration fixing @xmath148 and @xmath149 at the initial and final expression amounts of the corresponding bistable states @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in order to obtain the expression value of the bistable states for different morphogen signals ,",
    "the bistable switch was reconstructed using continuation strategies through the _ pydstool _ environment @xcite .",
    "simulation of the stochastic trajectories were performed using custom made code .",
    "realisations of the chemical langevin equation have been integrated using the euler - maruyama algorithm that reproduces the discrete wiener process @xcite , while the exact realisations of the kinetic reaction equations were performed using the gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "both methods require the reproduction of the whole trajectory and the computing time will be proportional to the trajectory time making these calculations very slow when computing stochastic switching events with increasing number of proteins @xmath48 .",
    "by contrast , the computation of the action is immediate , independent of the actual transition time between states , making it a useful tool for studying spontaneous cell fate change .",
    "the main drawback in computing the action is the unkown prefactor @xmath76 ( [ eq.maptime ] ) .",
    "this means that the transition time can be computed only to logarithmic precision @xcite . in cases in which a greater precision is required ,",
    "the prefactor @xmath76 can be obtained by fitting an exponential to average transition times obtained with the cle or gillespie at adequate values of @xmath48 , such that @xmath48 is large enough that the behaviour can be considered exponential , and low enough to obtain reasonable computation times",
