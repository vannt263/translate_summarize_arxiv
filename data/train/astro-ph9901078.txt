    "observational and theoretical efforts to understand the emission from high energy x - ray sources ( e.g. agn and black hole x - ray binaries ) have left no doubt about the existence of astrophysical plasmas with electron temperatures of order @xmath1 .",
    "as soon as the first hot accretion flow model was constructed ( shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 , hereafter sle ) it was realized that the production and annihilation of @xmath0 pairs may play an important role in such solutions .",
    "since then , enormous progress has been made in our understanding of the nature of @xmath0 equilibria , first in the context of static , isothermal hot plasma clouds ( e.g. lightman 1982 ; svensson 1982 , 1984 ; sikora & zbyszewska 1986 ; kusunose 1987 ; bjrnsson & svensson 1991a ) , and later for more realistic accretion disk models ( e.g. kusunose & takahara 1988 , 1989 , 1990 ; tritz & tsuruta 1989 ; white & lightman 1989 , 1990 ; bjrnsson & svensson 1992 ; bjrnsson et al . 1996 ; kusunose & mineshige 1996 ) .",
    "until now , most treatments of pair equilibria ( with the exception of the papers by zdziarski [ 1986 ] , kusunose & takahara [ 1989 ] , and kusunose & zdziarski [ 1994 ] ) have considered non - magnetic plasmas , in which the only photon production mechanisms are bremsstrahlung , double compton scattering and pair annihilation ( several authors include also an external soft photon source , e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "[ 1994 ] ) .",
    "however , there exists now a consensus that magnetic fields are universal in accretion flows and play an important role in their energy balance . in the presence of reasonably strong magnetic fields , synchrotron radiation dominates over any other photon production mechanism at mildly relativistic temperatures ( @xmath2 ) , and",
    "the presence of synchrotron photons can change significantly the results obtained for non - magnetized plasmas .",
    "an external source of photons , as in the case of a hot corona above a thin disk ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 , hereafter hm ) , will also modify the standard @xmath0 pair equilibria .",
    "recently , models for agn and galactic x - ray binaries based on pair - dominated coronae have been extensively discussed in the literature ( e.g. liang 1991 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "1994 ; skibo et al . 1995 ; stern et al .",
    "1995a , 1995b ; poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , most authors have concentrated on numerical computations of spectra , and have not given enough attention to more basic questions such as the existence and properties of pair equilibria for a range of relevant parameters and assumptions .",
    "kusunose & mineshige ( 1991 ) investigated a two - temperature disk corona , but they explored a relatively narrow parameter range .",
    "it is also not clear how their results are related to one - temperature pair - dominated coronae or a popular scenario ( suggested originally by hm ) in which part of the disk viscous energy is dissipated in the corona .",
    "moreover , since in their model the corona is heated through its own differential rotation , the dynamics of the coronal gas must be treated self - consistently , taking into account the radial energy advection term , especially for the high accretion rates considered in the paper .    in this paper",
    "we systematically investigate the existence and properties of pair - dominated equilibrium solutions for three different scenarios : one - temperature static thin disk coronae , heated by the viscous dissipation of the gravitational energy stored in the disk , two - temperature coronae , and hot accretion flows , similar to those introduced by sle and ichimaru ( 1977 , see also narayan & yi 1994 and abramowicz et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the latter problem was already discussed by bjrnsson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kusunose & mineshige ( 1996 ) .",
    "our treatment is different only in that we include synchrotron cooling in our calculation , which was left out by the previous authors .",
    "the detailed discussion of our initial assumptions and basic equations used for each of the three scenarios are contained in  [ basiceq ] .",
    "we find that pair - dominated solutions are easy to obtain only in the case of one - temperature coronae , while both two - temperature coronae and hot accretion flows always have negligible pair densities ( see  [ res ] ) .",
    "these results are discussed in  [ disc ] .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in  [ sum ] .",
    "following bj@xmath3rnsson & svensson ( 1991 , 1992 ) we divide the problem of finding equilibrium accretion flow solutions in the presence of @xmath0 pairs into two main parts , one dealing with radiative transfer and pair balance in a static plasma cloud , and the other describing the details of the dynamics and energetics in an accretion flow .",
    "bj@xmath3rnsson & svensson ( 1991 ) have shown that the physical properties of a non - magnetized plasma cloud are completely determined by specifying only two parameters .",
    "these are the proton optical depth , @xmath4 , and the dimensionless luminosity , or compactness parameter , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the size of the cloud , @xmath7 is the proton ( i.e. ionized electron ) number density , and @xmath8 is the radiative emissivity per unit volume . in this ( non - magnetic ) case , the mapping between the two parts of the calculation is particularly simple .",
    "the accretion flow is treated as a sequence of plasma clouds , whose size is equal to the scale height of the flow . at each point in the flow",
    "one needs only to specify @xmath9 and @xmath10 in terms of the usual accretion parameters : the mass of the accreting object @xmath11 , the radius @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and the accretion rate @xmath14 , normalized to the eddington value @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to treat a more general problem in which the accretion flow contains strong magnetic fields , which lead to non - negligible cooling via synchrotron radiation .",
    "we also allow for external heating and cooling sources which are relevant in a corona heated through dissipation of the thin disk gravitational energy and cooled via comptonization of thin disk radiation .",
    "when these effects are properly taken into account , in addition to the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , one needs to specify also the particle density @xmath7 or , equivalently , the cloud size @xmath6 , to completely determine the properties of a plasma cloud . with this modification ,",
    "the mapping between the cloud and flow properties is no longer as straightforward as in bj@xmath3rnsson & svensson ( 1991 , 1992 ) , and depends on the details of the initial assumptions . nevertheless , the mapping method is still a convenient technique for solving the problem of electron - positron pairs in accretion flows .",
    "pair equilibrium requires that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the positron number density , and the rate of pair annihilation on the left hand side is balanced by the sum of pair production rates via @xmath18@xmath18 , @xmath18@xmath19 , @xmath20@xmath20 , @xmath20@xmath18 , and @xmath20@xmath19 collisions , respectively , on the right hand side .",
    "we neglect pair escape from the cloud .",
    "the analytical expressions for the pair annihilation and electron - electron pair creation rates in a thermal plasma are given by svensson ( 1982 ) and white & lightman ( 1989 ) .",
    "according to svensson ( 1982 ) , the @xmath18@xmath19 rate can be ignored , since it is generally negligible compared with the @xmath18@xmath18 rate .",
    "the last three terms in equation ( [ pairb ] ) depend on the photon spectral density and , therefore , involve the details of the radiative transfer which we discuss below .    in a magnetized plasma ,",
    "thermal synchrotron and bremsstrahlung are the most important photon production mechanisms ( in this paper we ignore double compton scattering ) .",
    "in addition , there might be an external source of soft photons , e.g. blackbody emission from a thin disk irradiating a hot corona .",
    "the expressions for thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity are taken from svensson ( 1982 ) .",
    "the self - absorbed synchrotron emission is modeled using the formalism of mahadevan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and narayan & yi ( 1995 ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength , @xmath21 , is calculated under the assumption that the gas pressure is in equipartition with the magnetic field pressure in the cloud . for a tangled isotropic magnetic field",
    ", this implies that [ bfield ] = n_p m_e c^2 ( _ p + ( 1 + 2 z ) _ e ) , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are dimensionless proton and electron temperatures ( both in electron mass energy units ) , and @xmath24 is the pair fraction .",
    "the second term on the right side of equation ( [ bfield ] ) takes into account the pressure from pairs , as well as ionized electrons .",
    "in general , most of the primary photons are too soft to produce pairs . however ,",
    "when inverse compton scattering is important , many of the soft photons are boosted up to the wien peak . in that case collisions between photons in the wien peak as well as between wien and bremsstrahlung photons",
    "can dominate pair - production .",
    "we follow the approach of svensson ( 1984 , hereafter s84 ) and consider the radiation field as a sum of a flat bremsstrahlung continuum and a wien distribution . in this special case",
    ", the photon - particle and photon - photon pair production rate equations can be integrated analytically , and the resulting expressions depend only on the number density of the wien photons , @xmath25 .    in order to compute @xmath25 ,",
    "we solve the photon balance equation [ photonb ] f_b n_^b + f_s n_^s + f_d n_^d = n_/t_esc , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the rates of bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and external soft photon production respectively , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 represent the fractions of emitted photons that are scattered into the wien peak before escaping from the cloud .",
    "the details of how we compute these quantities are discussed in appendix [ apa ] .",
    "finally , we approximate the photon escape time as @xmath32 ( s84 ) , where @xmath33 is the total scattering optical depth of the cloud , and the factor @xmath34 incorporates the klein - nishina effect , averaged over the wien photon distribution .    for fixed @xmath35 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 , equations ( [ pairb ] ) , ( [ bfield ] ) , and ( [ photonb ] ) can be solved to obtain the equilibrium pair fraction @xmath24 and the cloud compactness , @xmath9 , which in general includes contributions from comptonized bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission , as well as comptonization of the external soft radiation ( see appendix [ apa ] ) . as was pointed out by s84 , in non - magnetized plasmas",
    "the results are practically independent of @xmath7 .",
    "the only dependence comes from the determination of the bremsstrahlung self - absorption energy , @xmath36 , defined so that at energies below @xmath36 , the local bremsstrahlung spectrum is a blackbody .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is computed using the expression derived by s84 . since the bremsstrahlung energy spectrum is nearly flat ,",
    "the total emission , as well as the pair production rate , are dominated by the high - energy end of the spectrum , and have at best a logarithmic dependence on @xmath36 , and therefore , @xmath7 . in the presence of magnetic fields ,",
    "however , the value of the proton number density becomes more important , because it determines the strength of the magnetic field ( see equation ( [ bfield ] ) ) as well as the value of the synchrotron self - absorption energy , @xmath37 , computed as described in esin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as opposed to the case of bremsstrahlung radiation , synchrotron emission is generally dominated by the self - absorbed part , so that the dependence on @xmath37 is no longer negligible .",
    "to compare our calculations with previous work , in fig .",
    "[ zfig ] we plot the equilibrium pair fraction ( panel a ) and corresponding compactness ( panel b ) as functions of the gas temperature @xmath38 for a single - temperature plasma cloud of a fixed size .",
    "there is no magnetic field , so that bremsstrahlung is the only source of soft photons .",
    "different curves correspond to different values of @xmath10 .",
    "the results are very similar to those of svensson ( 1982 , 1984 ) . for each value of @xmath10 ,",
    "there are two equilibrium solutions for temperatures below some critical value , @xmath39 ; one branch of the solutions ( indicated by the solid lines ) is pair - dominated , the other ( short - dashed lines ) is practically pair - free . above @xmath40 ,",
    "the pair production rate is greater than the pair annihilation for any value of @xmath41 and no equilibrium solution is possible .",
    "the critical gas temperature is itself a function of the proton optical depth , increasing with decreasing @xmath10 , until it reaches a maximum at @xmath42 .",
    "the pair - dominated solution branch exists only for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the critical temperature at which the pair fraction reaches its thermal equilibrium value , and the compactness reaches the blackbody limit ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ lfig](b ) ) .    at low @xmath10",
    ", the equilibrium values of @xmath41 on the pair - free solution branch converge to a single curve ( fig .",
    "[ zfig](a ) ) , since in this regime , pair production is dominated by particle - particle collisions which have the same scaling with density as the pair annihilation rate ( they both vary as @xmath45 ) . the compactness on the low-@xmath41 branch",
    "is dominated by bremsstrahlung and as a result , varies as @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ lfig](b ) ) . the high-@xmath41 branch , on the other hand , is dominated by photon - photon processes ; as a result the pair density is proportional to @xmath46 , while the compactness is independent of the proton optical depth , converging to the wien equilibrium values for @xmath47 .",
    "the only significant difference between our results and those of s84 is that we overestimate the pair fraction in the temperature range @xmath48 , where double compton scattering , which we neglect here , becomes an important source of photons .",
    "[ zsfig ] shows how the pair equilibria in a plasma cloud change in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic field strength depends on both the electron and proton temperatures ( see equation ( [ bfield ] ) , and for simplicity the results shown in fig .",
    "[ zsfig ] were calculated under the assumption that @xmath49 . a comparison of figs .",
    "[ zfig ] and [ zsfig ] shows that synchrotron cooling significantly changes the shapes of both @xmath41 and @xmath9 pair equilibria curves . on the low-@xmath41 branch ,",
    "the cloud compactness increases strongly for @xmath50 as compared to the pure bremsstrahlung case .",
    "synchrotron cooling causes the critical temperature to decrease considerably in denser clouds , with @xmath51 .",
    "by contrast , on the high-@xmath41 branch the compactness is practically unchanged , since it follows the wien equilibrium curve .",
    "but because of the extra cooling per lepton at temperatures where synchrotron emission is important ( @xmath52 ) , the equilibrium pair fraction in a magnetic plasma is up to @xmath53 times smaller than in non - magnetic plasmas .",
    "this figure also illustrates the point made previously , that the properties of pair equilibria in magnetized plasmas are _ not _ independent of the cloud size . for a fixed proton optical depth ,",
    "a larger cloud has smaller @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the value of the equipartition magnetic field is smaller as well , reducing the importance of synchrotron cooling .",
    "a comparison between the short - dashed curve computed for a cloud of size @xmath54 and a corresponding curve with the same value of @xmath10 but @xmath55 shows this effect .",
    "it is clear that the dependence on @xmath6 is not negligible , though it is not very strong .",
    "the low-@xmath41 compactness branch is affected the most , and an increase in @xmath6 by seven orders of magnitude , causes the value of @xmath9 to decrease by at most a factor of @xmath56 .      to relate the pair equilibrium solutions calculated for static plasma clouds to a realistic accretion scenario , we must express @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 in terms of the accretion parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and impose an appropriate energy balance condition .",
    "below we describe these mapping relations for two different accretion flow geometries : a corona above a thin disk (   [ onetcor ] , [ twotcor ] ) and a hot , optically thin accretion flow (  [ adaf ] ) .",
    "first we consider the simplest scenario , namely a static , hot , one - temperature corona above a cool , geometrically thin , optically thick disk .",
    "the study of such coronae was pioneered by hm .",
    "the corona is heated through viscous dissipation of the gravitational energy stored in the thin disk ( perhaps via magnetic reconnection , e.g. field & rogers 1993 ) , and in turn heats the disk by irradiation . using the formalism of hm , it is easy to show ( see appendix [ apb ] ) that the total emission per unit area from the thin disk , @xmath59 , is equal to @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the total viscous dissipation per unit area of the thin disk ( e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank , king , & raine 1992 ) with mass accretion rate @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the fraction of viscous energy dissipated directly in the corona , @xmath64 is the total scattering optical depth in the corona , @xmath65 is the fraction of radiation emitted or scattered in the corona that is incident on the thin disk , and @xmath66 is the fraction of incident radiation that is reflected by the disk .",
    "in general , @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend on the temperature and optical depth of the corona , the ionization state of the thin disk , and the spectrum of irradiating flux .",
    "however , since their exact values are not important in light of other approximation made in this work , we adopt the values @xmath67 and @xmath68 suggested by hm .",
    "this prescription constrains the disk emission to be always in the range @xmath69 , regardless of the exact values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "( note that @xmath59 is the disk emission as seen by the corona , not by a remote observer . )",
    "we assume that the thin disk radiates as a black body with a color temperature @xmath70    to estimate the characteristic size of the corona , we assume that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium , so that @xmath71 where @xmath6 is the scale height of the corona , @xmath72 is the mass density , and @xmath73 includes contributions from the magnetic and gas pressures .",
    "it is interesting to note that though in pair - free plasma the contribution of electrons to the mass density in the corona is entirely negligible , if the pair fraction is large enough , namely @xmath74 , pairs must be properly taken into account .",
    "this allows us to solve for the scale height : @xmath75},\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the ratio of the magnetic field pressure to the total pressure in the corona . in plasmas with no magnetic fields @xmath77 .",
    "when magnetic fields are taken into account we always assume equipartition between the gas and magnetic field pressure , corresponding to @xmath78 .",
    "knowing @xmath6 , allows us to write the energy balance equation for the corona , by equating compactness @xmath9 and viscous dissipation ( converted into a dimensionless compactness - like quantity ) : @xmath79 to compute the compactness @xmath9 of the corona , we include contributions from comptonized bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation , as well as inverse compton scattering of the thin disk photons ( see  [ ppbal ] and appendix [ apa ] for details ) .",
    "once the parameters describing the accretion disk ( @xmath80 , @xmath58 , @xmath81 ) and the corona ( @xmath63 , @xmath10 ) are fixed , we can solve equations ( [ pairb ] ) through ( [ otcorep ] ) to obtain the equilibrium pair fraction and temperature of the corona .",
    "we begin by solving pair and photon balance equations for a range of gas temperatures @xmath82 . as in the case of a static plasma cloud described in  [ ppbal ] above , we obtain two equilibrium curves for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , slightly modified due to the dependence of the scale height @xmath6 on @xmath85 and @xmath41 , and the increase in cooling through comptonization of the thin disk photons",
    ". then we calculate the dimensionless viscous dissipation rate ( the right hand side of equation ( [ otcorep ] ) ) as a function of temperature , again obtaining two solutions for each value of @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we solve for @xmath85 such that equation ( [ otcorep ] ) is satisfied , i.e. the cooling of the gas in the corona is balanced by viscous dissipation .",
    "the results are described in  [ rescor1 ] .",
    "depending on the microphysical details of how viscosity dissipates gravitational energy , it is feasible that only the protons in the corona are heated directly ( e.g. sle , rees et al .",
    "since protons generally can not radiate , viscous energy must be transfered to the electrons via coulomb collisions .",
    "the coulomb energy transfer is proportional to the difference between the electron and proton temperatures , so for the gas to be in thermal equilibrium we must have protons hotter than electrons , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "such two - temperature plasmas have been often invoked in the literature in the context of hot accretion flows ( sle ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; nakamura , kusunose , matsumoto & kato 1997 ; di matteo , blackman & fabian 1997 , to give just a few examples ) and it is important to investigate how the results for single - temperature coronae are modified when proton - electron energy transfer is explicitly taken into account .",
    "the only difference between one- and two - temperature coronae is that the latter must satisfy two energy balance equations instead of one .",
    "energy balance for the protons requires that viscous heating is equal to the coulomb energy transfer : @xmath87 for the electrons to be in thermal equilibrium , we must have @xmath88 the quantity @xmath89 is the rate of coulomb energy transfer per unit volume . in our calculations we use the expression for @xmath89 derived by stepney & guilbert ( 1983 ) @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is a modified bessel function of order @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and the coulomb logarithm is taken to be @xmath94 .    to obtain equilibrium solutions for a two - temperature corona , we begin by solving equations ( [ pairb])([h ] ) , ( [ ttcorp ] ) , and ( [ qie ] ) for a range of @xmath35 , to obtain @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . imposing electron energy balance",
    "then allows us to determine @xmath35 , such that equation ( [ ttcore ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this procedure is very similar to that described in ",
    "[ onetcor ] , except that we have an extra energy balance equation , which allows us to solve for @xmath35 and @xmath98 separately .",
    "in addition to static coronae above a thin disk , we also investigate pair production in pure optically thin , hot accretion flows .",
    "such flows were first proposed by sle and ichimaru ( 1977 ) and later extensively studied by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995 ) , abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , chen ( 1995 ) , chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and others .",

    "( 1996 ) addressed the problem of pairs in the context of these flows . in this paper",
    "we extend their calculations to include the effects of strong thermal synchrotron cooling .    as in two - temperature coronae",
    ", the protons in hot accretion flows are heated by viscous dissipation of gravitational energy , which is parameterized in the usual way through the viscosity parameter @xmath99 .",
    "however , we allow for the possibility that only a fraction @xmath100 of the dissipated energy is transfered to the electrons via coulomb collisions . the rest of the energy is stored in the gas as entropy and advected inward with the accretion flow .",
    "when the accreting object is a black hole , the stored energy is then lost inside the horizon . with these assumptions ,",
    "the energy balance equation for the protons takes the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the viscous dissipation rate per unit area of the flow , while the energy equation for the electrons is the same as in  [ twotcor ] above : @xmath103    to compute the rate of viscous dissipation , as well as all other relevant quantities in the accreting gas ( e.g. @xmath7 , @xmath6 , equipartition magnetic field strength @xmath21 , and total pressure @xmath73 ) , we use the self - similar solutions derived by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "these solutions allow us to express various gas properties as functions of the usual input parameters , @xmath80 , @xmath58 , @xmath57 , and @xmath99 as well as the new advection parameter @xmath104 .",
    "as opposed to the two - zone models discussed above , in hot accretion flows the mass accretion rate @xmath57 , which determines the rate of viscous dissipation , and the proton optical depth @xmath10 , which specifies the cooling rate of the gas , are not independent parameters .",
    "consequently , to obtain equilibrium accretion flow solutions it is sufficient to specify @xmath80 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath99 .",
    "we solve for equilibrium solutions in the following manner .",
    "for a fixed @xmath104 , the scale height of the flow and the characteristic sound speed at a given radius @xmath58 are completely determined by the self - similar solutions .",

    "[ corfig ] ; we see that for a fixed mass accretion rate in a thin disk , a corona with a relatively high proton optical depth is pair - free ( fig .",

    "[ corfig](b ) ) .",
    "this trend is easy to understand .",
    "the rate of viscous heating is determined by the mass accretion rate in the disk and is relatively independent of @xmath10 in the corona ( if we ignore the slight dependence through the vertical scale height ) , while the cooling rate on the low-@xmath41 branch , dominated by comptonization of the thin disk radiation , decreases linearly with @xmath10 .",

    "both two - temperature coronae and single - phase hot accretion flow models have pair fractions @xmath24 significantly below unity .",
    "what is the special feature of single - temperature coronae that allows them to be pair - dominated ?",
    "the answer seems to be that it has fewer constraints then the other two models .",
    "the gas in the corona is heated via viscous dissipation of energy in an underlying thin disk .",
    "the rate of such heating is completely determined by the properties of the thin disk ( namely , mass accretion rate @xmath81 and radius @xmath58 ) and is virtually independent of the amount or temperature of matter in the corona , which specify the cooling rate .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath81 , the energy balance in the corona allows us to solve for either @xmath10 or @xmath85 , but not both .",
    "one of these parameters has to be specified as an initial condition .",
    "this extra degree of freedom allows us to adjust the mass accretion rate in the disk and the optical depth of the corona to obtain thermal equilibrium solutions with @xmath123 .",
    "we find that such solutions are restricted to @xmath113 , where the critical value of the proton optical depth decreases with decreasing @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ taufig ] ) .    in a two - temperature corona ,",
    "heating and cooling rates are still relatively independent of each other ; however , proton energy balance imposes an important additional constraint on the model . the proton cooling rate via coulomb scattering between protons and electrons ( as well as pairs ) is sensitive to the number density of particles in the corona , while proton heating through viscous dissipation is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , protons are in thermal balance only for relatively high values of @xmath10 .",
    "but at these values of @xmath10 , electron energy balance requires @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "[ twotfig ] ) .    in the single - phase hot accretion flow model ,",
    "both viscous heating and radiative cooling rates are determined by the mass accretion rate in the flow . in this model",
    ", @xmath57 specifies both the optical depth and temperature of the accreting gas ; one can no longer adjust these variables independently in order to obtain pair - dominated solutions .",
    "we find that for a realistic range of values for the viscosity parameter @xmath99 , the pair density in hot accretion flows is negligible , both for the cooling - dominated ( sle ) and the advection - dominated ( ichimaru 1977 , narayan & yi 1994 ) solution branches . in the two - temperature accretion flow solution we have considered",
    ", the coulomb energy transfer bottleneck also plays a role in limiting the effects of pairs .",
    "even in one - temperature coronae , we find that pair - dominated solutions exist only over a relatively narrow range of the proton optical depth , for each value of @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ hfig](c ) ) .",
    "it is bounded from above by @xmath108 , imposed by the thermal equilibrium balance equation for the gas , and from below by the requirement that the hot gas in the corona should be gravitationally bound",
    ". the latter condition can be somewhat relaxed , if we assume that the corona is held in place not by gravity , but rather by magnetic field loops anchored in the thin disk .",
    "in fact , the most popular recent scenario for the dissipation of the thin disk gravitational energy in the corona is based on reconnection of the magnetic field loops generated in the disk and transported by buoyancy into the corona ( galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ; field & rogers 1993 ) . in this picture , if the magnetic energy density dominates the energy density of the gas , magnetic fields may prevent the escape of particles from the corona even if their temperature is above virial . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cooling of the gas in the corona is dominated by inverse compton scattering of the thin disk photons , electrons and positrons can undergo a considerable radiative acceleration along the accretion disk poles ( see for example liang & li [ 1995 ] , li & liang [ 1996 ] ) , which may allow the escape of pairs with temperatures below virial .    when we consider a one - temperature accretion disk corona with @xmath148 , an important question to ask is what keeps electrons and protons at the same temperature . if viscous dissipation preferentially heats the protons , as is often assumed in the literature ( e.g. sle ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1995 ) , the electrons will be considerably cooler than the heavier particles .",
    "our results for two - temperature coronae clearly show that coulomb energy transfer is too inefficient to equilibrate @xmath35 and @xmath98 .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to introduce some other more efficient energy transfer mechanism between the protons and electrons in the corona ( e.g. begelman & chiueh 1988 ) . on the other hand , recent work on dissipation mechanisms for mhd waves by quataert ( 1998 ) and gruzinov ( 1998 )",
    "indicate that in magnetically dominated plasma it is electrons , rather than the protons that are preferentially heated . in this case",
    ", the protons might even be cooler than the electrons ( if the accretion timescale is shorter than the coulomb energy transfer timescale ) .",
    "however , since it is the latter that contribute to cooling and pair - production , @xmath98 is practically irrelevant , so that the corona can be treated as a single - temperature gas cloud .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the results for thin disk coronae presented in this paper apply only to steady - state , homogeneous corona scenarios such as discussed , for example , by haardt & maraschi ( 1991 , 1993 ) , as opposed to time - dependent flare models in which a corona contains many localized active regions ( e.g. haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; stern et al .",
    "1995b , nayakshin & melia 1997a , b ; di matteo , celotti & fabian 1997 , 1998 ) . in the latter case , many of the constraints imposed to find the equilibrium solutions need not be satisfied . in particular , the protons may transfer only part of the viscously dissipated energy to the electrons and pairs . in that case",
    ", the protons will experience a net heating , until they reach virial temperature and escape from the system , perhaps in the form of an outflow or a jet .",
    "after that more material will be evaporated into the corona from the disk , and the cycle will be repeated .",
    "similarly , the pairs themselves may be periodically ejected from the corona driven either by radiative acceleration ( liang & li 1995 ) or simply through heating above their virial temperature , in the absence of energy balance .",
    "such transient or time - dependent situations are beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "we find that the properties of pair equilibria in static plasma clouds , taking into account synchrotron emission and comptonization of external soft photons differ only in quantitative details from the results of s84 , who restricted his study to comptonized bremsstrahlung and double compton emission .",
    "for every value of the proton optical depth , @xmath10 , there exists a critical electron temperature @xmath149 below which there are two pair equilibrium solution branches , one of which is pair - dominated , and the other practically pair - free . on the pair - free branch ,",
    "particle - particle pair production processes dominate and the pair fraction @xmath150 is independent of @xmath10 . by contrast , on the pair - dominated branch the electron ( and positron ) scattering optical depth is constant , so that @xmath115 .",
    "the extra sources of photons considered here ( synchrotron and external photons ) do not change the general character of the solutions , but they do decrease the value of @xmath151 so that pair equilibria are restricted to lower temperatures than in s84 .",
    "we studied in this paper three popular accretion scenarios involving hot plasmas to assess the importance of pairs .",
    "our results for the three models are summarized below :    * in the case of a single - temperature corona above a thin disk , the cooling of the gas must be balanced by viscous heating .",
    "the latter quantity is determined by the mass accretion rate , @xmath62 , in the thin disk and the fraction @xmath63 of the viscous energy which is dissipated in the corona . the compactness on the low-@xmath41 branch is due primarily to inverse compton scattering of synchrotron and thin disk photons , so that @xmath152 . as a result , for every value of the mass accretion rate in the thin disk , we find that there is a critical @xmath108 in the corona below which the equilibrium solution is pair - dominated ( see fig .",
    "[ taufig ] ) . for larger values of @xmath10 , pairs in the corona",
    "are unimportant .",
    "thus , while pure pair coronae are allowed , such coronae have very little mass and are dominated by energy deposition from the disk .",
    "* a two - temperature corona above a thin disk must satisfy two energy conservation equations , one for electrons and one for protons .",
    "that is , the coulomb energy transfer rate must balance both the rate of viscous energy input into the protons and the the cooling rate of the electrons . since the coulomb energy transfer is a two - body process , it is proportional to @xmath45 on the low-@xmath41 pair equilibrium branch and goes as @xmath153 on the high-@xmath41 branch .",
    "we find that the extra constraint on the energy balance ( compared to a single - temperature corona ) restricts solutions to relatively high values of the proton optical depth . only at such",
    "@xmath10 is coulomb coupling efficient enough .",
    "however , the critical @xmath10 is generally above the maximum @xmath108 up to which pair - dominated coronae are possible ( see figs .",
    "[ taufig ] and [ twotfig ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that , if viscous dissipation heats primarily the protons in the corona , the equilibrium solutions are generally pair - free . * finally , we have considered pair equilibria in hot accretion flows described by the self - similar solution of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) .",
    "we find that the energy transfer bottleneck due to coulomb coupling conspires with the advective cooling in these flows to limit the effects of @xmath154 pairs .",
    "we agree with the results of earlier investigators ( bjrnsson et al .",
