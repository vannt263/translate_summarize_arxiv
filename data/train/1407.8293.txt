    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) @xcite represents one of the most prominent perspective techniques of non - invasive imaging in medicine .",
    "the first demonstration of recording data in positron detection was taken in early 1950s @xcite , only two years after the first medical application of the positron was reported @xcite . in 1973",
    "j.  roberston and his co - workers built the first ring pet tomograph , which consisted of 32 detectors @xcite .",
    "this scanner has become the prototype of the current shape of pet .",
    "since the early detection of small lesions and monitoring of the functionality of organs are critical for prophylaxis and efficient treatments , notable efforts are nowadays devoted to improve the resolution of reconstructed images .",
    "it was realized that the measurement of the difference of arrival times , or times of flight ( tof ) , of two gamma rays provides substantial progress in this domain @xcite . the new class of instruments , called tof - pet , better",
    "localize the emission source along a straight line of gamma coincidence , called the line of response ( lor ) .",
    "the lors are basic components of image reconstruction algorithms .",
    "currently all commercial pet devices use inorganic scintillator materials , usually lso or lyso crystals , as radiation detectors .",
    "these are characterized by relatively long rise- and decay times , of the order of tens of nanoseconds .",
    "time resolution in pet examinations is crucial and one observes persistent strive for improvement  @xcite .    in recent articles",
    "@xcite , an utterly new concept of tof - pet scanner was introduced .",
    "it incorporates plastic scintillators with good resolving time and the tof method .",
    "disadvantages due to the low detection efficiency and negligible photoelectric effect in organic scintillators can be compensated by large acceptance and good time resolution  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the method allows for drastic reduction of the production cost of pet scanners and is promising for the construction of the single bed whole body pet scanner .",
    "a single detection unit of the newly proposed tof - pet detector  @xcite is built out of a long strip of scintillator , read out on both sides by photomultipliers .",
    "such a solution enables the reconstruction of coordinates of the gamma quantum interaction along the scintillator strip by measuring signals at its two ends .",
    "a similar solution for crystal scintillators has been recently developed by the ax - pet collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the 10  cm long lyso crystals were coupled to digital silicon photomultipliers ( dsipm ) , and a very good coincidence time resolution of about 200  ps ( fwhm ) was achieved . in plastic scintillators ,",
    "the 511  kev quanta from electron - positron annihilation produces signals burdened with large fluctuations of the number of photoelectrons .",
    "therefore a usage of the typical techniques for time measurement , based on the application of a single - level leading - edge or constant - fraction discriminators , is not sufficient .",
    "therefore a multithreshold sampling method to generate samples of a pet event waveform with respect to four user - defined amplitudes was proposed .",
    "a similar idea may be found in  @xcite , where a coincidence timing resolution of about 340  ps was obtained for lso crystals . in",
    "@xcite the four sample points that comprise the rising edge were fit to a line , and the intersection of the fitted line with the zero voltage level defined the event time of the pulse .    in this article we propose a new method for reconstruction of the gamma quantum hit position .",
    "the method is based on the statistical model of signals probed in the voltage domain .",
    "an electronic system for probing these signals is under development  @xcite . in the following",
    "we describe a new concept of reconstruction of the gamma quantum hit position .",
    "the description includes an explanation of the methods used for the test of the normality of data , determination of the effective number of degrees of freedom , as well as explanation of the selection criteria applied to the experimental sample .",
    "then we describe an experimental setup used for signal registration and present results of reconstruction of the hit positions of gamma quanta in 30  cm long plastic scintillator strip , read out on both sides by the hamamtsu photomultipliers r4998 .",
    "signals from the photomultipliers were sampled in 50  ps steps using the lecroy signal data analyzer 6000a .",
    "light pulses produced in the strip propagate to its edges where they are converted into electric signals .",
    "these are sampled in the amplitude domain using a predefined number of voltage levels .",
    "the measurement gives a vector of @xmath1 values of times at which the signal crosses the reference voltages .",
    "this vector carries information about the shape of the signals and their times of arrivals to the edges of the scintillator .",
    "these shapes depend on the hit position and can be used for its reconstruction .",
    "the method of hit - position reconstruction consists of two steps .",
    "first , the scintillator s volume is discretized and for each bin a high statistics set of reference signals is created . in the example",
    "discussed later , each set contains approximately 5  000 signals generated by irradiation with gamma quanta at a fixed scintillator position .",
    "the objective of the second part of the procedure is to qualify the new measurement to one of the given sets of signals and hence determine the hit position .",
    "consider @xmath2 data sets @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "each @xmath3 is a @xmath5 matrix of vectors representing signals gathered for the @xmath6 position ; @xmath7 is the number of the collected signals and @xmath8 stands for vector s dimension equal to the number of samples per signal . in practice",
    "all signals have the same dimension and @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 signal in the @xmath6 data set corresponds to the @xmath11 row of the matrix @xmath3 and is denoted by the vector @xmath12 .",
    "if the measured coordinates of vectors in all @xmath2 data sets are normally distributed then the mean value @xmath13 and covariance matrix @xmath14 of the data set @xmath3 describe it completely .",
    "assuming their normality , the proposed reconstruction procedure qualifies a new measurement , represented by vector @xmath15 , to one of the data sets @xmath3 by using only information about @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the first step of the reconstruction , the mahalanobis distances @xmath16 between @xmath15 and @xmath13",
    "are calculated : @xmath17 next , the measured signal @xmath15 is qualified to the data set @xmath18 with the smallest distance @xmath16 : @xmath19      there are number of existing procedures for testing whether multivariate vectors from a given dataset have a multivariate normal ( mvn ) distribution . for example",
    "mardia  @xcite proposes multivariate measures of skewness and kurtosis , which are special cases of mvn moment restrictions .",
    "in addition , multivariate generalization of the well known kolmogorov - smirnov  @xcite and shapiro - wilks  @xcite tests have been established .",
    "there are also available tests based on a @xmath20 quantile - quantile ( q - q ) plot of the observations squared mahalanobis distances .    in this work ,",
    "we propose an alternative procedure for testing a mvn distribution as an extension of statistical test based on q - q approach  @xcite . in order to verify normality of the data set in @xmath21 , the observations squared mahalanobis distances for @xmath7 vectors from @xmath21 data set",

    "we provide a statistical test for data set @xmath21 by comparing the distribution of @xmath24 defined in eq .",

    "the normalization of theoretical histogram is provided to ensure that sum of counts in both histograms is the same and equal to @xmath7 ( see eq .  [ mahal_dist ] ) .",
    "we apply uneven bin size , in order to store in each bin of the theoretical @xmath20 histogram a constant number of counts @xmath25 .",
    "this simplifies a control of the assumption about the normal distribution of number of counts in each bin . in the calculations , we have selected @xmath25 = 30 , and",
    "therefore the poisson distribution may be approximated accurately by the normal distribution .",
    "hence , we compare the two histograms via statistical test @xmath26 defined as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 value is the number of counts in the @xmath29 bin in the experimental histogram from the @xmath6 data set , and @xmath30 ( the number of bins in the histograms from the @xmath6 data set ) .",
