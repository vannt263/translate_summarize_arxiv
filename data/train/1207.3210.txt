    "@xcite to heavier nuclei than @xmath0he exposing more some details .",

    "this presentation of the binding energy and width as a function of the complex scattering length is not necessarily trivial .",
    "however , due to the shape independence of nuclear forces with this phenomenology a connection between the basically distinct observables can be considered as better justified than their direct connection to the potential , independent on the validity of the simplest impulse approximation optical model .    for specificity ( and to facilitate a comparison to the impulse approximation ) , the potential can be expressed as @xmath28 with @xmath29 the reduced mass of the @xmath30 system . here",
    "the nuclear density @xmath31 can be varied from nucleus to nucleus and for each nucleus the strength parameters are freely varied to get a sufficient coverage of the @xmath27 plane .",
    "it should be stressed that we are not predicting any absolute strength of the potential as in the model works referred above .",
    "the main thing is the numerical connection of binding energies and widths to the scattering parameters , so that if the latter can be extracted from data , then a preliminary estimate could be obtained for the former .",
    "although both are in some ranges sensitive to the potential parameters , in the spirit of the shape independence of @xmath3 forces , one might expect a relatively density profile independent connection .",
    "indeed , in ref . @xcite it was checked that the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath27 was robust against changes in the density profile .",
    "in contrast to the free variation , within the optical model ( as _ e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the strength would be related to the elementary @xmath30 scattering length as @xmath33 with @xmath34 the atomic number of the nucleus .",
    "the scattering program is fairly standard even with a complex potential .",
    "this involves solving the schrdinger equation with the proper asymptotic boundary condition @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the reduced mass of the @xmath4-nuclear system .",
    "the binding solutions are obtained searching by iteration for poles in the homogeneous lippmann - schwinger integral equation ( in configuration space ) @xmath38 equivalent to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the green function arguments are @xmath39 the smaller ( larger ) of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for @xmath1-wave bound states this reduces to @xmath42 where now @xmath43 .",
    "the convergence was good except for real potentials with very small binding energy ( @xmath44 mev ) where the wave functions are much more extensive than the potential range .",
    "this case could reasonably be considered as essentially the zero binding limit with also extremely large cross section .",
    "convergence stopped also in case of very large widths @xmath45 mev , in which case the wave functions tend to be of shorter range than the potential .",
    "the latter case is certainly not of experimental interest ( with binding still at most in low tens of mev or rather a few mev ) .",
    "the @xmath1-wave scattering parameters are defined as is standard for mesons by @xmath46 so that for a real attractive potential @xmath47 means binding ( we shall later bring up a more exact condition ) .",
    "experiments extract so far only the scattering length @xmath48 , but it is notable that the effective range @xmath49 is of the same order in the range of most interest .",
    "therefore , its experimental determination ( or inclusion of theoretical predictions by hand ) in analyses would also be of interest and importance .",

    "this success can be attributed to the inclusion of a non - zero effective range @xmath49 and can be considered as another indication of its importance .",

    ". this behaviour results in the two `` branches''of the @xmath63 plots . the upper branch ( starting from left for @xmath71 mev and potential real )",
    "could be considered as a `` weak potential '' part .",
    "a general rule of thumb is that the imaginary potential , absorption , behaves like repulsion , although the above mentioned non - monotonousness means that , in a way as inelasticity , it eats its own effect out at some stage . while @xmath68 grows with increasing @xmath70 , the real part @xmath63 decreases , eventually to no binding .",

    "it can be seen that with increasing binding energy the upper `` weak potential '' branch comes down , whereas the lower `` strong potential '' part slowly bulges up .",

    "one may look at this effect also in another way .",
