    "asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) have been introduced originally in 1968 as a theoretical model for a description of kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite .",
    "although in last years the area of application of asep has been significantly broadened @xcite , and it now includes a road traffic flow analysis @xcite , polymer dynamics in dense medium @xcite , and many other problems , the major application of aseps remains the modeling of various biophysical transport phenomena . in particular , simple exclusion processes have been used successfully to describe protein synthesis @xcite , mrna translation phenomena @xcite , gel electrophoresis @xcite , a motion of motor proteins along the cytoskeletal filaments @xcite and the depolymerization of microtubules by special enzymes @xcite .",
    "asep are discrete non - equilibrium models that describe stochastic dynamics of multi - particle transport along one - dimensional lattices .",
    "the lattices are finite and generally consist of @xmath0 sites .",
    "each site can be occupied by a single particle or empty , and the particles interact only through the hard - core exclusion potential .",
    "the dynamics of asep is asymmetric , i.e. , the particles can hop to the left or to the right but with different probabilities .",
    "in the simplest totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) the particles move only in one direction . in this case",
    "the rules for the motion are the following .",
    "the particle at site @xmath1 can move one step forward if the site @xmath2 is empty .",
    "the particle can enter the lattice with the rate @xmath3 if the first site is available , and it can leave the system from the last site @xmath4 with the rate @xmath5 . in the stationary - state limit of tasep , the system can be found in one of three phases depending on entrance , exit or bulk processes dominate the overall dynamics .    the unusual dynamic properties and phase behavior of asep and a wide range of applications in chemistry , physics and biology stimulated many theoretical studies of asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "there are several exact results for the steady - state properties of asep for different update rules @xcite , although most theoretical investigations utilize the approximate methods along with monte carlo computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the coupling of several exclusion processes has been considered in the study of parallel - chain asep @xcite the combining of non - equilibrium exclusion processes with equilibrium particle association / dissociation phenomena led to unusual phenomena of localizations of density shocks @xcite . however , despite the differences in the specific dynamic rules and stationary properties of specific asep , the microscopic origin of unusual dynamic properties and phase behavior can be well understood with the help of a phenomenological domain wall theory @xcite .",
    "the majority of the investigated asymmetric exclusion processes deal with the particle movement along the one - channel lattices .",
    "although the one - channel approach describes many situations in the biophysical processes , the more realistic description of the cellular transport requires an extension of original asep to include the possibility of a transport on the lattices with a more complex geometry .",
    "for example , consider the motor proteins kinesins that move vesicles and organelles along the microtubules and play important role in cellular transport @xcite .",
    "microtubules are made of parallel linear polymers , called protofilaments , that are arranged circumferentially .",
    "it is known that kinesins walk only on single protofilaments .",
    "however , experiments @xcite indicate that the number of protofilaments may vary , at least for _ in vitro _ conditions , and it indicates the existence of junctions and other lattice defects . such defects might lead to motor proteins crowding phenomena that are responsible for many human diseases @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest an importance of investigation of the asymmetric exclusion processes on the lattices with junctions as a model for these complex biological transport phenomena .",
    "recently brankov et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated tasep on chains with a double - chain section in the middle by using an approximate theory and computer simulations .",
    "this corresponds to having two consecutive junctions on the lattice .",
    "several stationary phases , the existence of which has not been expected , are found .",
    "in addition , the density profiles at phase boundaries and strong correlations between different lattice branches have been observed , but they could not be explained because the theory neglected the correlations . in this paper , we present a theoretical investigation of tasep on the lattice with one junction .",
    "we develop a simple approximate theory that allows to calculate particle currents , density profiles and a phase diagram at large times . at first - order phase boundaries",
    ", we develop an extension of the domain wall theory @xcite that accounts for correlations .",
    "this approach is then applied for explicit calculations of density profiles .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared with extensive monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the model is introduced and theoretical calculations of stationary properties are presented . in section 3 theoretical predictions are compared and discussed with the results of monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "the final summary and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "we consider identical particles that move along the lattice with the junction positioned in the middle of the system as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the system is out of equilibrium , and it has three equal - size branches , each containing @xmath6 sites . the particles can enter chain i or chain ii with the rate @xmath3 if the first site at the corresponding branch is available .",
    "two chains merge together at site @xmath7 and form chain iii .",
    "the particle can leave the system with the rate @xmath5 : see fig .",
    "1 . inside of the lattice",
    "chains the particle can only move one step forward if the neighboring site is empty .        without chain i or chain ii ,",
    "the junction disappears and the system reduces to a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on the one - channel lattice , for which the full description of stationary properties , such as phase diagram , particle currents and density profiles , are known @xcite .",
    "this simplest model of tasep on the lattice without junctions has three stationary phases . when the entrance into the system is a rate - limiting process , for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the system is found in a low - density ( ld ) phase with the current and bulk density given by @xmath10 if exit controls the dynamics of the system , for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the stable stationary state for the system is a high - density ( hd ) phase with the following current and bulk density @xmath13 finally , for large entrance and exit rates ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , when the dynamics is determined by bulk processes , the system is in a maximal - current ( mc ) phase with @xmath16 full density profiles for systems of any size can be calculated explicitly @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of complex phase behavior and unusual dynamic properties of asymmetric exclusion processes can be explained via a phenomenological domain - wall ( dw ) theory @xcite .",
    "according to this approach , the domain wall is the boundary region between two possible stationary phases , and it moves through the system as a random walker with a speed determined by the currents and densities in two phases : @xmath17 where `` + '' ( `` @xmath18 '' ) corresponds to the phase to the right ( left ) of the domain wall , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 give the domain wall rates to hop to the right or left .",
    "for @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the domain wall moves to the right and the `` negative '' phase becomes a stationary state of the system , while for @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the domain wall travels to the left and the `` positive '' phase wins over . on the phase boundaries the domain wall has equal probability to go forward or backward , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as a result ,",
    "the density profiles are linear .",
    "this is due to the fact that the domain wall can be found with equal probability at any position in the system .",
    "the overall state of the system is specified by the nature of phases that might exist in each of the lattice branches . since",
    "only three stationary phases can be found in each lattice chain ( hd , ld or mc ) , the total number of possible stationary phases in the system with the junction is equal to @xmath27 .",
    "however , because of a symmetry , chains i and ii should have identical phases ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the overall state of the system is determined by phases in the chain i ( or ii ) and the chain iii .",
    "then the number of possible stationary states reduces to only @xmath28 .    the overall stationary current passing through the system",
    "can be written as @xmath29 it suggests that chain i and ii can not have the the maximal - current phase with @xmath30 , because the maximal possible current through the system is just equal to 1/4 .",
    "thus , there are only 6 possible stationary phases : ( ld , ld ) , ( ld , hd ) , ( ld , mc ) , ( hd , ld ) , ( hd , hd ) and ( hd , mc ) , where in the expression ( a , b ) a describes the phase in the chains i and ii , while b corresponds to the phase in the chain iii .    the junction introduces an inhomogeneity in the system and it makes impossible to solve the large - time dynamics exactly @xcite .",
    "however , tasep on the lattice with the junction can be mapped into 3 coupled homogeneous asymmetric exclusion processes as shown in fig .",
    "2 , for which the approximate description can be developed @xcite . in order to obtain the dynamic properties of the system explicitly , in the simplest approximation , we assume that there are no correlations in the occupation of the sites before and after the junction , i.e. , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability to occupy the site @xmath6 on the chain i or ii , and @xmath33 is the average particle density at the site @xmath7 of the chain iii . the effective rates @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) can be expressed in terms of the particle densities at the sites near the junction , @xmath36        now we can investigate the existence of different stationary phases .",
    "consider first ( ld , ld ) phase , which can be specified by the following conditions , @xmath37 the stationary currents and bulk densities are given by @xmath38 using the expression ( [ stat_current ] ) for currents , the effective rate @xmath34 can be expressed in terms of the entrance rate @xmath3 , @xmath39 thus @xmath34 always satisfy the conditions ( [ ld , ld ] ) , however , this equation yields physically reasonable values of the effective entrance rate only when the term in the square root is positive , i.e. , @xmath40 because @xmath41 in ( ld , ld ) phase , the effective exit rate , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eff_rates_def ] ) , is given by @xmath42 .",
    "then the condition @xmath43 is true for all values of parameters .",
    "thus the system is in ( ld , ld ) phase when @xmath44    for the ( ld , hd ) phase the conditions of existence can be written as : @xmath45 while the stationary currents and bulk densities are @xmath46 because the particle current is stationary , eq .",
    "( [ stat_current ] ) implies that @xmath47 these expressions describe the parameter s space for ( ld , hd ) phase .",
    "similar analysis can be performed for ( ld , mc ) phase .",
    "the allowed parameters for this phase are specified by @xmath48 the currents and bulk densities have the following values : @xmath49 then the currents in the chain i and ii are @xmath50 , which implies that @xmath51 this equation along with the condition @xmath52 fully determines the region of existence of ( ld , mc ) phase .",
    "the situation is very different for ( hd , ld ) phase for which @xmath53 the corresponding equations for the currents and bulk densities are @xmath54 it is known that in this phase @xmath55 and @xmath41 . then from eq .",
    "( [ eff_rates_def ] ) it can be shown that @xmath56 however , these two equations have no real solutions together , and therefore ( hd , ld ) phase can not exist for any value of the entrance rate @xmath3 and the exit rate @xmath5 .",
    "the ( hd , hd ) phase is determined from the conditions @xmath57 the stationary properties of this phase are given by @xmath58 the stationary condition for the particle currents [ see eq.([stat_current ] ) ] helps to determine the effective exit rate constant , @xmath59 after combining this result with the set of phase existence requirements ( [ hd , hd ] ) we obtain the final conditions for ( hd , hd ) phase : @xmath60 and @xmath61    the last possible phase in the system is ( hd , mc ) phase , which is specified by the following conditions : @xmath62 the particle currents and bulk densities in this phase are given by @xmath63 from eq.([stat_current ] ) it can be easily shown that @xmath64 comparing this result with the conditions ( [ hd , mc ] ) , we finally derive @xmath65 these expressions describe the phase space for ( hd , mc ) phase .",
    "thus the analysis that considers tasep on the lattices with junctions as coupled asymmetric exclusions systems suggests the existence of 5 phases .",
    "the calculated phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that two phases , namely , ( ld , mc ) and ( ld , hd ) , correspond to stationary phase boundaries .",
    "this result is due to the neglect of correlations around the junction point .",
    "however , at these conditions , the domain wall , that separates two phases can move with equal probability to the right or to the left @xcite .",
    "then the density profiles will be different from the one predicted in the simplest theory , that treats the correlations around the junction in a mean - field manner .",
    "it can be expected that the density profile is linear in the chain i and the chain ii segments for ( ld , mc ) phase , extrapolating between coexisting low - density and high - density phases , while the density profile in the chain iii still corresponds to the maximal - current phase . for ( ld , hd ) phase the linear density profiles can be found in all lattice segments , although the slopes strongly depend on inter - segment density correlations .",
    "[ fig3 ]       qualitative domain - wall arguments presented above indicate that particle density changes linearly for some phase coexistence lines .",
    "however , exact linear density profiles might differ significantly from the densities obtained within the simplest approximate theory that neglects the correlations near the junction . here",
    "we utilize the domain - wall approach @xcite to account for these correlations in order to derive the phase boundary density profiles explicitly .    the line specified by @xmath66 for @xmath52",
    "( see fig .",
    "3 ) describes the mixed phase coexistence between ( ld , ld ) and ( hd , mc ) .",
    "when crossing this line , the density jumps in the lattice segments i and ii , while the change is continuous in the chain iii . at the phase",
    "boundary the domain wall in the chain i or ii moves randomly with equal forward and backward rates between the low - density ( @xmath67 ) and high - density ( @xmath68 ) regions .",
    "the domain wall picture can not be used in the lattice chain iii when the maximal - current phase appears @xcite , and the inter - segment correlations are not significant .",
    "then the resulting density profiles in the left lattice segments are expected to be linear , connecting the low - density and high - density values .    to determine the density profiles at the phase boundary between ( ld , ld ) and ( hd , hd ) phases",
    "is a much more complicated problem because of the strong correlations around the junction .",
    "this phase coexistence line is given by the following conditions : @xmath69 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . the domain wall separates the coexisting stationary phases and it can be found in any lattice segment .",
    "let us define a position of the domain wall in the system via relative coordinate @xmath70 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the site index and @xmath6 is the length of one lattice segment .",
    "therefore , the case of @xmath73 describes the chain i and ii , while @xmath74 corresponds to the chain iii .",
    "when the domain wall is in the chain i ( and simultaneously in the chain ii ) it can move with the same rate @xmath75 to the left or to the right , while in the chain iii it travels forward or backward with the rate @xmath76 : see fig .",
    "4 . these rates can be determined by utilizing the expression ( [ dw_vel ] ) , @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 as a result , we obtain the following expressions for the rates @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath80 @xmath81    [ fig4 ]     to calculate the density profiles we introduce a probability @xmath82 to find the domain wall at any position in the chain i or ii , and @xmath83 gives the probability that the domain wall is in the lattice chain iii .",
    "these probabilities are obviously normalized , @xmath84 the probability that the domain wall occupies a specific site @xmath72 is equal to @xmath85 or @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "then at the junction @xmath89 this relation reflects the fact that the domain wall has equal probability to travel between different lattice segments . by combining last two equations we obtain : @xmath90 these expressions have a simple physical explanation .",
    "the domain wall spends less time in the lattice segments where it fluctuates faster .",
    "all lattice chains have the same length @xmath6 , and the domain wall in the lattice segment where it fluctuates faster is able to diffuse to the junction point quicker . as a result",
    ", it will jump to another lattice chain more frequently .",
    "this is a reason for strong inter - segment density correlations at the first - order phase transitions .",
    "we can determine the probabilities of having the domain wall at any position less then a certain value of x. if the domain wall is in the channels i and ii at the coordinate @xmath91 , then this probability is given by @xmath92 similarly , for the domain wall in the lattice chain iii , @xmath93 then the density at any position can be calculated as @xmath94 finally , combining eqs .",
    "( [ rho+- ] ) , ( [ u1 ] ) , ( [ u3 ] ) , ( [ p ] ) , ( [ prob_dw1 ] ) and ( [ prob_dw2 ] ) we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath74 . at the entrance sites we have , as expected , @xmath97 , while at the last site @xmath98 . at the junction ,",
    "the densities are equal to @xmath99 it is important to note that the densities at junction are not equal to the values @xmath100 for the chain i and ii , and @xmath101 for the chain iii , respectively , as expected from the simplest approximate theory that assumes an independent coupling between the lattice segments .",
    "the domain - wall approach allows to take into consideration the correlations in the densities around the junction .",
    "in order to check the validity of our approximate theory we performed extensive computer monte carlo simulations . since the computer calculations for the cases of phase transitions are very time - consuming , especially for small values of entrance and exit rates , we utilized one of the continuous - time monte carlo algorithms , the so - called bkl algorithm , first introduced by bortz , kalos and lebowitz almost 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the bkl algorithm is to create an event - driven update scheme , so that the rejected , `` eventless '' steps are skipped .",
    "the method is simple to implement , and with the latest improvements @xcite it is also very efficient and fast .    in our simulations",
    "the number of effective steps per site was typically around @xmath102 . at phase transitions we ran simulations much longer , and the number of effective steps per site was @xmath103-@xmath104 . for all simulations",
    "we neglect first @xmath105 of monte carlo steps to account for the time that the system takes to achieve a stationary state .",
    "our theoretical calculations assume infinite size lattice segments , however , in our simulations we used @xmath106 and we checked that for larger sizes of lattice segments the results do not deviate from the ones presented here .    a phase diagram obtained from monte carlo simulations is shown in fig .",
    "the boundaries between the stationary phases have been determined by considering the saturation in the currents and comparing qualitative changes in the density profiles .",
    "specifically , the phase coexistence line between ( ld , ld ) and ( hd , hd ) phases is found when the density profiles become linear .",
    "the boundary between ( ld , ld ) and ( hd , mc ) phase is determined when the linear density profile is observed in the chains i and ii , and the overall particle current saturates .",
    "similarly , the current saturation method allows to specify the phase boundary between ( hd , hd ) and ( hd , mc ) phases . the overall error in the determination of phase boundaries is less than @xmath107 @xcite . to illustrate our approach ,",
    "the dependence of current on the entrance rate @xmath3 ( for fixed exit rate @xmath108 ) is plotted in fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the current saturates at @xmath109 .",
    "[ fig5 ]     monte carlo simulations allowed also to calculate explicitly the particle densities .",
    "the resulting density profiles for different stationary phases are shown in fig .",
    "6 . since the stationary properties in the chains i and ii are essentially the same , we investigated in detail only one of two equivalent lattice segments .",
    "the computer simulations for the densities in the bulk phases are well described by the theoretical predictions .",
