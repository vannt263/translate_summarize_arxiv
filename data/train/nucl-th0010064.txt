    "suppression of @xmath0 production is considered to be one of the promising signals for detecting the formation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent reports by the na50 collaboration @xcite show an anomalous suppression of @xmath0 production in pb@xmath9pb collisions at cern .",
    "model calculations , which assume the formation of a deconfined state of quarks and gluons @xcite at the initial stages of the collision , seem to be successful in explaining the anomalous suppression .",
    "however , before coming to a definite conclusion on the existence of the qgp state in such collisions , it is essential to investigate whether the observed @xmath0 suppression can be explained by a more conventional approach that does not assume the existence of qgp state . in such models ,",
    "the suppression comes from the absorption of @xmath0 by the co - moving hadrons @xcite . since such co - mover models",
    "strongly depend on the cross sections of @xmath0 absorption by hadrons , it is essential to have a better knowledge of the magnitude and energy dependence of the cross sections .",
    "this is not an easy task , but is indispensable for true identification of qgp in rhic .",
    "the absorption of @xmath0 by light hadrons has been investigated using various methods @xcite .",
    "the estimated values for the cross sections show a strong dependence on the hadronic models and assumptions on the absorption mechanisms employed in the calculation .",
    "the first set of models uses the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "using perturbative qcd in the heavy charm quark mass limit @xcite , kharzeev , satz , and their collaborators @xcite found very small absorption cross sections at the order of @xmath10b . in ref .",
    "@xcite , martins , blaschke , and quack investigated the charmonium dissociation processes , @xmath11 , and @xmath6 using quark exchange model and found a strong enhancement near the threshold with an exponential falloff at higher energies .",
    "the peak was found at @xmath12 gev with a value of about @xmath13 mb .",
    "this calculation was recently improved by wong , swanson , and barnes @xcite by using a more successful quark - interchange model and hadron wave functions . the cross section for @xmath8",
    "was found to be relatively small with a maximum of about @xmath14 mb , while the pion induced @xmath15 dissociation process had a much larger cross section with lower threshold for the initial kinetic energy .",
    "another approach to @xmath0 absorption is to use effective meson lagrangian @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the authors considered @xmath16-channel meson exchanges to estimate the @xmath0 absorption cross sections . in ref .",
    "@xcite , matinyan and mller calculated @xmath17 meson exchange diagrams and found small cross sections around @xmath18 mb for @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "the obtained cross sections were found to increase with energy .",
    "this calculation was improved by haglin @xcite , who included @xmath19 meson exchanges and four - point couplings in the @xmath0 absorption mechanisms .",
    "similar calculations were recently performed by lin and ko @xcite .",
    "the new results show a rather large cross section for @xmath20 and @xmath5 , i.e. , about @xmath21 mb at @xmath22 gev , which at higher energies saturates to about @xmath23 mb .",
    "however , for a realistic structure of the mesons , form factors have to be taken into account .",
    "inclusion of form factors generally reduces the cross sections . with suitable form factors and cutoff parameters , which however can not be justified",
    "_ a priori _ , lin and ko @xcite concluded that the saturated absorption cross sections for @xmath8 and @xmath7 are around @xmath13 mb and @xmath24 mb , respectively .",
    "all of the meson exchange model calculations discussed above essentially use the same effective meson lagrangian ; namely the minimal su(4 ) yang - mills lagrangian .",
    "two immediate questions can arise .",
    "the first is the use of su(4 ) symmetry in constructing the effective lagrangian . obviously , charm quark is much heavier than the other three light quarks and the su(4 ) symmetry is nowhere near being true in qcd . nevertheless , the starting point of using the su(4 ) lagrangian is to categorize the possible interaction vertices among the meson multiplets and estimate as many of their respective couplings by phenomenology as possible .",
    "doing so , not all of the couplings can be fixed .",
    "however , it turned out that for couplings that can be checked , one finds that the su(4 ) symmetry relations for coupling constants are not totally meaningless @xcite .",
    "such checks provide the order of uncertainty for the calculated absorption cross sections within the effective lagrangian method , and makes the calculation meaningful .",
    "the second question is whether all possible interactions are considered .",
    "it is to this question that we want to address in this paper .",
    "the previous studies did not fully take into account all possible set of interaction lagrangian involving @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the anomalous parity interactions which are connected to the gauged wess - zumino action are all missing .",
    "furthermore , the anomalous term such as @xmath25 is essential and required by heavy quark spin symmetry and its coupling is strongly constrained to the @xmath26 coupling @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , inclusion of @xmath25 coupling opens new absorption channels and mechanisms which were not considered in the literature .",
    "therefore , to fully estimate the @xmath0 absorption cross section within the hadronic model , it is necessary and important to see the effect of the anomalous interactions to such processes , which we will investigate in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our effective lagrangian .",
    "the interaction lagrangian needed for @xmath0 absorption processes by @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons are obtained and the cross sections are evaluated . then in sec .",
    "iii , we determine the coupling constants and give the numerical results for the cross sections .",
    "section iv contains summary and discussions .",
    "some details on deriving our effective lagrangian are given in appendix .",
    "in the heavy quark mass limit ( @xmath27 ) , effective lagrangian for light ( @xmath28 ) and heavy ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) mesons can be constructed to preserve chiral and heavy quark symmetries @xcite .",
    "when the heavy quark flavor is the charm , finite mass corrections are expected to be important and should be introduced in the effective lagrangian in a systematic way .",
    "the couplings of the finite mass corrections can be fixed by `` velocity reparameterization invariance '' @xcite or by phenomenology .",
    "this `` top - down '' approach seems to be most plausible way to construct the effective lagrangian .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how to implement heavy quark symmetry to the interactions of quarkonia with light hadrons as the quarkonium states ( @xmath31 ) such as the @xmath0 contain two heavy constituents .",
    "another approach which was used in previous investigations @xcite is the `` bottom - up '' approach . in this approach ,",
    "one starts with the su(4 ) symmetric chiral lagrangian .",
    "the heavy charm quark mass is then assumed to be taken into account through appropriate symmetry breaking terms @xcite .",
    "however , since the su(4 ) symmetry is badly broken , finding all the appropriate symmetry breaking terms is very hard and beyond the scope of this work . in this paper , therefore , we use the `` bottom - up '' approach phenomenologically to categorize all the possible interaction vertices among the meson multiplets .",
    "the couplings are then determined by experimental data and by implementing heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "doing so , most of the three point couplings can be determined .",
    "for the four point couplings and some three point couplings , where such determination is not possible , we will partly rely on the su(4 ) relations as well as other model predictions .    as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we start with the su(4 ) lagrangian for the pseudoscalar mesons and introduce the vector and axial - vector mesons by the massive yang - mills approach @xcite .",
    "the axial - vector fields can be gauged - away as in ref .",
    "the procedure to obtain the effective lagrangian is well explained , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and is summarized in appendix .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 then reads    [ lag1 ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and we define the charm meson iso - doublets as @xmath35    in addition to the normal terms given above which were used by refs .",
    "@xcite , there are anomalous parity terms .",
    "the anomalous parity interactions with vector fields can be described in terms of the gauged wess - zumino action @xcite and are summarized in appendix . by the same method",
    "used to obtain the normal terms , we get    [ lag2 ] @xmath36    with @xmath37 . in the heavy mass limit , due to the heavy quark spin symmetry ,",
    "the pseudoscalars and vectors become degenerate and have to be treated on the same footing . as a consequence ,",
    "the anomalous @xmath25 interaction term is required and can be related to the @xmath26 interaction term by the heavy quark spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "let us first evaluate the absorption processes of the @xmath0 by @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons within the effective lagrangian obtained above .",
    "the values of the coupling constants will be discussed later . in this study",
    ", we assume that the @xmath0 is a pure @xmath38 state and consider the ozi - preserving processes only at the tree level .",
    "the diagrams we are calculating are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pions ] and [ fig : rhos ] . compared to the previous studies",
    "@xcite , we find that the anomalous parity interactions open new absorption channels , namely @xmath39 [ diagram ( 1 ) ] , @xmath40 [ diagram ( 3 ) ] , and @xmath41 [ diagram ( 5 ) ] .",
    "these processes are not allowed by the normal terms and were not considered before in the effective lagrangian approach . in the quark exchange model @xcite , however , the processes @xmath40 and @xmath41 were calculated .",
    "there , @xmath39 was not considered since the absorption amplitude vanishes unless one considers the spin - orbit force @xcite .",
    "a recent study using the dyson - schwinger formalism shows that the cross section for @xmath39 is small @xcite .",
    "the anomalous terms also allow new absorption mechanisms to the previously considered absorption channels .",

    "[ fig : pions ] and [ fig : rhos ] . although the @xmath39 process has the lowest threshold energy , its cross section ( dotted line in the upper panel of fig . [",

    "i.e. , @xmath121 gev which corresponds to @xmath128 gev , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the @xmath0 and pion masses respectively , the anomalous interactions reduce the total absorption cross section for @xmath8 by about @xmath131  % .",
    "our numerical results show that the @xmath8 absorption cross section is less than @xmath132 mb in this energy region .",
