    "performing studies of the internal or external factors that cause galaxies to evolve is predicated on the availability of statistically significant numbers of target galaxies that exhibit resolvable , implicative signs of these processes .",
    "one way to do this is by observing a large sample of nearby galaxies and searching for faint features that exist at or outside their outer ` edges ' ( at or outside the 25  mag  arcsec@xmath4 @xmath5-band isophotes ; ` @xmath6 ' ) .",
    "such features may be a sign of past interactions and mergers that the targeted galaxy has undergone in its recent or even extended ( billions of years ) past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "gas accretion from the intragalactic medium , possibly from filaments , may be the cause for faint outer features such as warps and polar rings , in addition to asymmetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "internal causes for asymmetry include lopsidedness due to dark halo asymmetry ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , statistics of the frequency of existence of these features around nearby galaxies will help us to assess the importance of the afore - mentioned processes on galaxy evolution .",
    "the main approach to detecting faint features in the outer regions of galaxies is through visual classification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most well - known catalogues of unusual features in and around galaxies is ` arp s atlas of peculiar galaxies ' @xcite .",
    "another fundamentally important visual classification of interacting and merging galaxies was made by @xcite .",
    "other more recent attempts to visually classify galaxy morphology include ` the de vaucouleurs atlas of galaxies ' @xcite and ` galaxy morphology ' @xcite .",
    "the quantitative approach to detecting unusual galaxy features based on , e.g. , asymmetry , concentration , clumpiness , and the gini inequality parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) works better in regions of high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , namely , in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "thus , these two approaches are often complementary , as the quantitative method will miss faint features at or outside the outer edges of galaxies , where the eye can pick up features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can form the basis for future quantitative studies after much deeper , high s / n images are available . indeed , when detecting features in the outermost regions of galaxies ( or outside their continuous luminous bodies ) , such as outer disc asymmetries , warps , tidal features , etc .",
    ", it can be argued that the human eye is still often the most effective tool for picking up faint patterns ( although attention needs to be paid to erroneous identifications , such as faint residual images ) .",
    "false positive detections can be reduced to some degree by using more than one person to detect the features of any given galaxy .",
    "the effort to avoid false positive detections , although not in the context of faint outer features , has been taken to its extreme in the galaxy zoo project ( www.galaxyzoo.org ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows anyone to go online and categorize a shown galaxy with references to a few illustrated morphological choices .",
    "an automated detection and classification of galaxy features with the help of neural networks has also been attempted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but so far it has worked better in assigning galaxies into broad morphological classes based on inner large - scale features , rather than in detecting weak patterns outside the main bodies of galaxies . because any remaining image artefacts are more prominent outside the main bodies of galaxies , any automatic feature detections there would likely have to be checked by eye , further reducing the usefulness of automatic detection methods outside @xmath6 .",
    "the visual detection of features at or outside the outer edges of galaxies may be used to obtain an estimate of the rate of current and recent interactions , the merger rate , the frequency and importance of external gas accretion from the intergalactic reservoir , the number of companion galaxies , statistics on the asymmetries of galactic haloes , and the disc structure overall .",
    "the intrinsic limitations in visual detections include naturally the depth and spatial resolution of the data , the flat - fielding accuracy , and the effects of interference from other perturbing astronomical or instrumental sources , such as scattered light from nearby bright stars and image artefacts , and the techniques used to look at the data ( including the visual acuity of the person performing the detection , of course ! ) .",
    "recent work on detecting faint features outside the main galaxy discs include those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . on the other hand , a morphological classification of mostly bright inner features within the discs of an initial set of galaxies from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath2 g ; @xcite @xcite )",
    "was made by @xcite , with classifications for the remaining galaxies in @xcite .",
    "an attempt to classify tidal features in s@xmath2 g galaxies , including shells , was made by @xcite .",
    "other major attempts to visually detect inner features in fairly large samples of nearby galaxies include those by @xcite and @xcite .    in future the number of suitably observed galaxies will increase to millions ( e.g. , with the large synoptic survey telescope , lsst ) , and it will not be feasible to perform human eye based feature detection by experts in these new samples . therefore",
    ", visual search for faint features in relatively large galaxy samples , consisting of thousands of galaxies , such as s@xmath2 g , will also form a good training basis for automated computer algorithms that recognize patterns and classify them in the future .",
    "we have selected the visual detection method in this work because we are just beginning to look for tidal and other types of outer features .",
    "quantitative or automatic methods are already good in quantifying something that is known to exist in high s",
    "/ n data , and will grow increasingly powerful in detecting faint features in images in the future ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "our current effort emphasizes the detection and discovery of subtle new features , possibly related to tidal interaction or accretion , which are best picked up by eye , but can perhaps be automatically detected with sophisticated codes in the future .",
    "follow - up work may be able to quantify our new discoveries . in this paper",
    "we refer to already performed quantitative work that was based on the high s / n regions of the galaxies in the s@xmath2 g sample @xcite , and therefore , inside @xmath6 .",
    "the current paper thus complements the earlier work on s@xmath2 g galaxies and extends it farther out in radius , where it presents discoveries of faint features that should be quantified in the future when higher s / n observations are available .",
    "ellipse fits to the _",
    "spitzer_/irac images and parameters derived from these fits are given in @xcite and are available in the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) at http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu / data / spitzer / s4g/. however , it should be noted that in the outermost galaxy regions that we are surveying in this paper , the ellipse fits are too uncertain to be trusted and some of the outer features can not be approximated by ellipse fits at all , leaving the visual detection as the only viable way to find new faint features there .",
    "s@xmath2 g consists of near - infrared images and thus has some unique advantages over conventional visual band images .",
    "first , the spectral energy distribution of late type stars , including many luminous asymptotic giant branch stars , peaks in the near - infrared , and may thus reveal features that are not clearly visible at shorter wavelengths .",
    "second , in general , the dominant light in the near - infrared is coming from older stars than the light at shorter wavelengths , thus revealing longer lived , major dynamical features , as opposed to recent bursts of star formation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that it is possible to separate the contributions from the various stellar components and measure the mass directly with the help of s@xmath2 g near - infrared images .",
    "therefore , the longer - term time evolution of galaxies can be better studied .",
    "third , the effects of cold dust that can block features from view is dramatically reduced in the near - infrared . in our study ,",
    "in which we look at features mostly outside the main galaxy bodies or at the edges of them , the effects of dust are generally thought to be less important than closer to the centre of galaxies , but some of the features that we classify , such as shells , polar rings or even warps , may be blocked from view at least partially at visible light wavelengths .",
    "additional benefits of s@xmath2 g , as explained in section  @xmath7 , are the uniformity and depth of the s@xmath2 g images across the sample and finally , the spatial coverage of the images , which around most sample galaxies extends to at least 1.5 @xmath8 @xmath0 in radius , making this sample amenable to morphological classification of faint features in the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "the sample we used is the full s@xmath2 g sample @xcite , consisting of 2,352 galaxies ( ten of the 2,331 galaxies specified in @xcite @xcite were not observed , mostly because they were close to a very bright star , and 31 galaxies were added ) with systemic velocity @xmath9 @xmath10 3000  km  s@xmath11 , corresponding to a distance @xmath12 @xmath10 45 mpc for a planck mission based hubble constant @xcite of 67  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and a distance @xmath12 @xmath10 41 mpc for a hubble constant of 71  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 , total corrected blue magnitude @xmath13 @xmath10 15.5 , blue light isophotal angular diameter @xmath14",

    "we used the channel 1 ( 3.6 @xmath1 m ) mosaics made of eight 30 second frames per spatial position .",
    "the survey is described in detail in @xcite which is the main reference for the s@xmath2 g sample and data .",
    "597 galaxies in the sample already had observations in the _ spitzer _ heritage archive , and almost all of them have a total frame time depth of at least 240 seconds ( that of the new observations ) .",

    "( 150s ) , and ngc 5218 , ngc 5216 , and ngc 5576 ( 192s ) .",
    "several of the archival observations are from the _ spitzer _ sings @xcite and lvl @xcite legacy projects that had a very similar mapping strategy to the s@xmath2 g observations .",
    "we started with the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) that are the fundamental irac pipeline - reduced images from the individual exposures .",
    "the data were subsequently run through the s@xmath2 g pipeline 1 that mosaics them together using the space telescope science data analysis system ( stsdas ) dither package ( @xcite @xcite ; regan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "cosmic rays are eliminated in this process and the images are drizzled together to a mosaic that has @xmath19 pixels ( the original pixel size is about @xmath20 ) . @xcite",
    "give more details on pipeline processing .",
    "we used only the 3.6 @xmath1 m mosaics to search for faint outer features .",
    "the 4.5 @xmath1 m images are usually almost identical to the 3.6 @xmath1 m images , but are farther from the peak of the old stellar population spectral energy distribution , and may suffer from hot dust contribution .",
    "it should be noted that the 3.6 @xmath1 m band contains the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission band , while the 4.5 @xmath1 m band contains a co absorption band .",
    "we displayed each galaxy with the saoimage ds9 astronomical imaging and data visualization application @xcite , using both the histogram equalization and log scales , and in both black - and - white and rainbow color schemes , adjusting to the extremes of contrast and sampling carefully the contrast in between the extremes .",
    "we also experimented with making unsharp - masked versions of the images , but did not use those in the final classification of the outermost features , as they did not help in the detection of the outermost features .",
    "we can reliably classify features down to a per pixel surface brightness level of 0.03 mjy / sr ( 21.5 vega mag  arcsec@xmath4 , 24.3 ab mag  arcsec@xmath4 , or about 2.5  @xmath21 above the background level ) based on the faintest detected structures ( the polar ring candidates ) and assess asymmetries in the outer isophotes at about 0.01 mjy / sr ( 22.7 vega mag  arcsec@xmath4 or 25.5 ab mag  arcsec@xmath4 ) level at 3.6  @xmath1 m .",

    "the detected features were iterated upon until all the classifiers that looked at any given feature agreed .",
    "immediate agreement was found for more than 2/3 of the features .",
    "the whole team of authors of this paper discussed the detected features , and a consensus was formed on the discovered features reported in this paper .",
    "we searched for eight kinds of features ( in no case was the same feature classified as belonging to two or more different classes listed below , and every feature was classified as belonging uniquely to one of the following classes ) :    1 .",
    "asymmetries of the _ outer _ isophotes . if the outermost visible isophotes were not elliptical , we called the galaxy ` asymmetric . '",
    "irregular outer isophotes were not a sufficient reason to classify a galaxy asymmetric if the overall outer isophote appearance was elliptical .",
    "we did not have any cases of symmetric boxy isophotes that we would call an asymmetry by our rule .",
    "however , if the nucleus was offset or the inner parts were lopsided , but the outermost visible isophotes were smooth and elliptical , we did not call the galaxy asymmetric .",
    "lopsidedness , based on the inner high s / n parts of a small subsample of 167 s@xmath2 g galaxies is discussed in another paper @xcite .",
    "all of the discovered outer disc asymmetries , as well as all the other features that we detected and classified , are given in figures  [ fig1 ]  [ fig8 ] and they are tabulated in table  [ table1 ] that also shows the t - types and the 3.6 @xmath1 m absolute ab magnitudes . 2 .   a clear extension on any ` side ' of the galaxy .",
    "an ` extension ' is usually a narrow feature extending clearly far out from the edge of the galaxy . in no case",
    "was the same feature called both an ` asymmetry ' and an ` extension . '",
    "most extensions do not appear to be associated with spiral arms , but in a few cases spiral arms extend well outside the visible disc or main body of the galaxy , and were thus classified as ` extensions . '",
    "warps of the disc galaxies ( for more on edge - on galaxies in the s@xmath2 g sample see @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these were only looked for in galaxies that were of very high ellipticity as seen by eye .",
    "we looked for visually discernible deviations from a straight line on both sides of the centre of a galaxy and called the galaxy warped if either side ( or both ) showed a visually detectable curvature .",
    "we did not pay attention to the derived inclination values of the galaxies while searching for warps .",
    "therefore , some of the elongated nearly face - on galaxies were classified as ` warped . ' in section 5 we present statistics only for truly warped galaxies ( high inclination galaxies ) , but keep all the original warp classifications in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "warps are different from asymmetries in truly inclined galaxies , as a warped galaxy may still have a symmetric disc in its plane , but the plane itself is twisted .",
    "4 .   tidal tails .",
    "these are curved features outside the main bodies of the galaxies , but connecting to them in most cases .",
    "these features are usually found in galaxies that appear to be interacting or merging , but sometimes tidal - like features are seen in apparently non - interacting galaxies , and could result from past mergers . these features extend and curve around galaxies for much longer distances than extensions ( usually comparable in length to half the catalogued galaxy diameter ) . in some cases a curvy shorter feature outside the main galaxy disc was also called a tidal tail .",
    "it is possible that some of the features classified as tidal tails are associated with outer ring features such as in ngc  1079 @xcite .",
    "5 .   shell features .",
    "definitions of shell features are given in @xcite .",
    "these features exist usually around elliptical and lenticular galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they usually have sharp , curved edges in their light distribution at their outer edge , with the concave part always pointing towards the galaxy centre .",
    "there is no reason why they should exist only around elliptical galaxies , and therefore , we searched for them in disc galaxies as well .",
    "however , there is some expectation that shells should be less likely in disc galaxies , because they arise from deeply plunging orbits that would perturb the disc . in section  [ statistics ]",
    "we discuss the differences of our detected shell features from those of @xcite in the s@xmath2 g sample .",
    "6 .   interacting and merging galaxies .",
    "the _ revealing _ and defining sign of an ongoing interaction between disc - like galaxies is a bridge or some connecting material between two galaxies .",
    "however , early - type galaxies may not have such obvious signs of interaction and may be missed in a visual search .",
    "we did not use any velocity information in our interaction / merger classifications .",
    "thus , two or more galaxies close to each other in systemic velocity but with no bridge feature between them would be classified as ` companions ' ( see below ) .",
    "a merger leaves behind a very disturbed morphology and tidal features , but no signs of two ( or more ) separate galaxy bodies are left over .",
    "kinematic observations of galaxies in our merger class should be able to reveal whether they are truly mergers or just irregular galaxies .",
    "polar rings around main galaxy bodies . for definitions , see again @xcite .",
    "polar rings are features that are usually perpendicular to the position angle of the major axis of the galaxy , but they can exist at other apparent angles as well .",
    "they are often needle - like features extending outside the main bodies at a sharp angle to the major axis .",
    "companion galaxies .",
    "we looked for nearby companion galaxies in the imaged area around the sample galaxies and if found , checked their systemic velocity . if the systemic velocity , checked using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , was within @xmath22600  km  s@xmath11 of the target galaxy systemic velocity , we classified it as a companion galaxy .",
    "previous studies using isolation criteria or searches for companion galaxies often use systemic velocity ranges between 500  km  s@xmath11 and 1000  km  s@xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our value of 600  km  s@xmath11 is a compromise between these two , and represents the velocity dispersion of a modest size cluster of galaxies ( less than virgo ) , and more than that of a galaxy group , so we would find galaxy group members .",
    "there can be interacting galaxies beyond this cut in some rare cases , such as possibly ngc  4435 and ngc  4438 .",
    "note that the physical size of the imaged area varied a lot , as the sample galaxies are at distances from 1 to about 60 mpc ( almost all of them within about 40 mpc ) , and vary in physical size as well .",
    "if a velocity measurement was not available for a nearby galaxy , we did not include it as a physical companion galaxy .",
    "in addition to these detected features , we kept track of image features that made the search for these faint outer features associated with the galaxy very uncertain or impossible .",
    "such interfering features include most often bright stars that are located on top of , or near the edges of the main bodies of the galaxies , remaining image artefacts , pointings where the galaxy is near the edge of the field of view , and galaxies with very patchy and faint morphology , showing no continuous main bodies .",
    "all these galaxies are marked with a ` u ' in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "note that ` ? ' in the classification column in table  [ table1 ] after a feature symbol means that the assignment of a feature into one of the above - mentioned classes was uncertain , but not due to the interfering feature uncertainty marked by the letter ` u. '    the displayed asymmetries most often have a clear departure from a pure elliptical outer edge .",
    "this can in some cases be due to the presence of strong spiral arms that continue outside the main body of the galaxy ( e.g. , ngc 2750 in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "some galaxies are not elliptical at all in their outer regions , such as ngc  3628 in fig .",
    "more extreme departures from elliptical outer isophotes are also seen",
    ".    there may be some overlap between the categories of ` asymmetric ' and ` extensions . '",
    "however , we considered an extension to be a feature clearly protruding out of the galaxy disc , instead of , for example , a slight extension of one ` side ' of the galaxy compared to others .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates what we consider to be extensions .",
    "often the extensions are small - scale features protruding out from the galaxy .",
    "there is possibly some overlap between the ` extension ' and ` tidal tail ' categories as well .",
    "we considered extensions usually to be linear features protruding out of the galaxy discs at close to right angles to the major axis , whereas curved features often seen starting close to the end of the major axis are considered to be tidal tails .",
    "the presence of an ` interacting ' or ` merger ' morphology is a reason to consider an extended feature a tidal tail instead of an extension .",
    "real warps of the disc are naturally seen only in fairly high inclination galaxies ( @xmath23 @xmath15 @xmath24 65@xmath18 ; fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "but as stated earlier , we allowed elongated and twisted irregular galaxies to have ` warps ' as well .",
    "however , when calculating the statistical numbers of warps , we only counted warps in highly inclined galaxies as explained in detail below .",
    "polar rings were the hardest features to discern in the images , and they are rare .",
    "image artefacts , such as , for example , the presence of column pulldown ( examples are seen in the irac instrument handbook ) , may conspire to create a polar - ring -like impression .",
    "partly for this reason , our polar ring assignments are all uncertain .",
    "the main catalogue is presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we list the galaxy name , the 3.6 @xmath1 m t - type ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , the galaxy absolute 3.6 @xmath1 m ab magnitude @xcite , and the presence of any detected features .",
    "the 17 hubble types from e to de / ds / sph are assigned numerical t values as follows : @xmath25 ( e ) , @xmath26 ( e@xmath27 ) , @xmath28 ( s0@xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( s0@xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ( s0@xmath27 ) , 0 ( s0/a ) , 1 ( sa ) , 2 ( sab ) , 3 ( sb ) , 4 ( sbc ) , 5 ( sc ) , 6 ( scd ) , 7 ( sd ) , 8 ( sdm ) , 9 ( sm ) , 10 ( i m ) , and 11 ( de , ds or sph ) @xcite .",
    "the ab magnitudes were calculated using the mean redshift - independent distance from ned whenever available , and a hubble constant of 71  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 otherwise .",
    "asymmetries are by far the most common feature we found .",
    "we found 506 asymmetric galaxies in the sample , or 22@xmath221 per cent ( uncertainty is purely statistical , calculated as the standard deviation of a binomial distribution ) .",
    "there is of course a large range in the magnitude of asymmetry .",
    "even if we remove the questionable cases , we are left with 469 or 20@xmath221 per cent asymmetric galaxies in a sample of 2,352 galaxies .",
    "earlier studies , such as @xcite who examined a sample of 18 face - on spiral galaxies in the @xmath33-band and found that a third of them were lopsided , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see references therein ) , who inspected over 25,000 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey , measured lopsidedness in the whole galaxy disc , although the latter study found that lopsidedness ( that causes asymmetry ) increases with radius ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our result for the asymmetry fraction can also be compared to the quantitative morphological classification of s@xmath2 g galaxies inside their luminous bodies by @xcite .",
    "they find that roughly one quarter of the s@xmath2 g sample galaxies are ` disturbed , ' meaning that according to cas criteria @xcite these galaxies have an asymmetry value larger than their smoothness value , and the absolute value of the asymmetry is greater than 0.38 .",
    "note that the quantitative criterion uses all the pixels inside the @xmath24  @xmath6 radius but not outside of it , in the regions that we are concerned with in this paper and thus there may be a detection of asymmetry in the quantitative classification scheme but not in our visual examination which only considered the radii at @xmath6 and outside of it .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry fractions in the current paper and in @xcite are not directly comparable .",
    "we plot the distributions of absolute 3.6 @xmath1 m ab magnitudes and t - types for asymmetric galaxies in figures  [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , respectively .",
    "as less massive late - type galaxies are structurally more prone to outer disc disturbances than early type massive elliptical and lenticular galaxies due to the often younger and kinematically more uniform stellar populations of the less massive , late - type galaxies , we expect , and observe , that the fraction of asymmetries goes up towards the later types .",
    "similarly , using quantitative measurements in a small s@xmath2 g subsample , @xcite found that there is greater lopsidedness for galaxies of later type and lower surface brightness .",
    "a similar increase in asymmetry towards later types was seen in the quantitative s@xmath2 g morphology paper @xcite .",
    "also @xcite found that the least massive galaxies have a higher merger rate and therefore presumably look more asymmetric than the massive galaxies at low redshifts ( their sample went down to @xmath34 ) , consistent with our results at @xmath35 close to zero .",
    "the s@xmath2 g sample is dominated by ` extreme late - type galaxies ' ( sd , sdm , sm , and i m ) , and these types are characteristically asymmetric , especially sdm and sm .",
    "the use of a radio radial velocity in the sample definition weighted the sample towards these types .",
    "the luminosity distribution shows that the s@xmath2 g sample is magnitude - limited , and therefore distant , intrinsically faint galaxies are not included .",
    "it is notable that only 14/48 or 29@xmath227 per cent of the galaxies classified as undergoing an interaction in our study have asymmetric outer discs ( table  [ table2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "out of the 506 galaxies with asymmetric outer disc classifications in our study , only 14 are interacting galaxies , based on visual bridges between galaxies .",
    "this result , combined with the fact that only 64/212 or 30@xmath223 per cent of galaxies that have companions within the mapped area have asymmetric outer discs ( table  [ table2 ] ) , has been used as evidence by @xcite to argue that small lopsidedness in the s@xmath2 g sample of galaxies is mainly caused by internal factors , such as dark halo asymmetries .",
    "small asymmetries in the dark halo can give rise to larger , observable stellar asymmetries @xcite .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that our low correlation of asymmetries with interactions and companions may be caused by 1 ) the outer isophotes remaining relatively elliptical even if there is a minor perturbation ( satellite interaction or minor merger ) ; 2 ) not being able to count all the companions because of limitations in the field of view and depth of the survey ; and 3 ) as compared to such samples as the galaxy zoo @xcite , our sample size being still relatively small",
    ".    there may be several different origins for the outer disc asymmetries , including internal effects , such as lopsidedness @xcite .",
    "if we assume that they are overwhelmingly due to interactions , it is possible to make an argument for the duration of asymmetries in outer discs due to interactions as follows .",
    "the magnitude of the brightness asymmetries in the outer halves of the discs of several galaxies studied here is around 50 per cent .",
    "we estimate whether this is high enough to produce significant torques and radial flows if the disc mass follows the disc light .",
    "we consider for simplicity a @xmath36 asymmetry of magnitude @xmath37 per cent .",
    "then the outer disc mass in four quadrants varies in azimuth as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath39 is one - quarter of the disc mass in the radial interval of the asymmetry , say , the outer half of the disc . in this case , the forward and backward torques on the minor axes of the asymmetry are    @xmath41 r / ( 1.4 r)^2\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the average radius of the outer disc and @xmath43 is the distance between quadrants in the outer disc where the masses are @xmath39 and @xmath44 .",
    "setting the torque on a quadrant equal to the time derivative of @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the rotation speed and @xmath42 is the radius ) , and considering that the mass and rotation speed do not change much during the subsequent adjustment , we obtain the radial outflow or inflow speed @xmath47 that is driven by this asymmetry :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the total disc mass in the radial range of the asymmetry and @xmath50 is the total galaxy mass inside the radius @xmath42 that gives the rotation speed , using the equation @xmath51 .",
    "if we consider that the outer disc mass is @xmath52 per cent of the total mass inside the radius @xmath42 , then @xmath53 , which is a fairly small effect at any one time , giving , e.g. , @xmath54 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this is barely enough to relax and mix an outer asymmetry spanning a radial range of @xmath52 kpc by disc torques in a hubble time .",
    "more important would be mixing and smearing of the asymmetry by shear given the rotation curve from dark matter . in the outer disc ,",
    "the rotation time is @xmath55 gyr , so this would be the approximate lifetime of an initially @xmath36 asymmetry at @xmath56 kpc before shear turns it into a spiral or tidal arm .",
    "galaxy interactions that perturb discs down to @xmath57 kpc would produce tidal arms four times faster , in @xmath58 gyr .",
    "however , asymmetries in the far outer disc might still be visible after several rotations , or some @xmath59 gyrs , as suggested by the cosmological zoom re - simulations in section  [ simulations ] .",
    "if only half the galaxies have a strong interaction which leaves signs that last for 4  gyrs , then in 10 gyrs ( a typical galaxy age ) we would see 40 per cent of that half with an outer disc asymmetry , or a total of 20 per cent of all galaxies that we see at any given time would have an asymmetry , assuming that interactions take place at random times during the 10 gyr galaxy age .",
    "this 20 per cent is comparable to the fraction of discs in our survey that have perceptible outer disc asymmetries , suggesting that many of these structures could be remnants of interactions less than about @xmath59 gyrs ago , with the older structures now mixed and invisible .",
    "it should be noted that the lifetime estimates we get this way depend on the assumption that the asymmetries are exclusively due to interactions .",
    "if other factors are in play , the lifetime of the features could be shorter or there may have been fewer interactions .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our estimate of about 20 per cent asymmetries to the fractional estimate of 15 per cent of asymmetric , lopsided , warped or distorted with an integral - sign like appearance or tidal feature ( tail , bridge or shells ) in the sample of @xcite of visible light images of 466 isolated nearby galaxies with systemic velocities between 1,500 and 24,000 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this difference may be due to different depths of the surveys , different distance limits on the samples and a different wavelength region surveyed .",
    "extensions were found in 6@xmath221 per cent of the whole s@xmath2 g sample .",
    "figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] display histograms versus 3.6 @xmath1 m absolute ab magnitudes and t - types for galaxies with extensions .",
    "we did not find any clear absolute magnitude ( more extensions might be expected to be seen among the low mass , often irregular low luminosity systems ) or t - type dependence for extensions .",
    "we have found warps or possible warps in 32 edge - on galaxies among the 489 highly inclined ( @xmath23  @xmath15  @xmath60 ) galaxies ( 7@xmath221 per cent ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that the inclination has to be higher than @xmath61 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a warp to become visible in visual or near - ir observations , but we allow here for ` warps ' in less inclined galaxies . using @xmath62 as the minimum inclination , we find warps in 9 out of 75 galaxies ( 12@xmath224 per cent ) .",
    "warps have been conventionally found in h observations , e.g. , @xcite , where they are often more obvious and produce higher warped fractions in the smaller samples that were observed than here .",
    "warp studies using visible light images detected a higher fraction of warps in the samples that were biased towards more inclined , bright , late - type galaxies , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* per cent ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* per cent ) .",
    "the warped galaxies in our study are predominantly less bright than @xmath63 , and have mostly hubble t - types from 3 to 10 ( or sb to i m ) .",
    "we thus confirm the @xcite result concerning galaxy type , but we disagree with the effect of luminosities and so , presumably mass .",
    "we have classified ten other galaxies as warped because our classification took place without a priori knowledge of the inclination of the galaxies .",
    "these are mostly galaxies with low inclinations and elongated morphologies and therefore are not ` warped ' in the sense of edge - on discs . for four of them",
    ", the warp detection is questionable .",
    "tidal tails are found in 71/2,352 galaxies or in 3@xmath221 per cent of the sample galaxies .",
    "24 of these detections are uncertain . because of the limited map size , it is not clear in many cases which galaxy is causing these tidal features .",
    "several examples of the ` diffuse ' tidal tail morphology are seen ( in the similar visual classification scheme of @xcite @xcite who used it for intermediate redshift galaxies out to @xmath35=1.4 in the gems and goods fields ) .",
    "also some examples of the ` antenna ' morphology are seen .",
    "our sample can be used as a nearby comparison sample for future comparisons of detections of tidal features in higher - z galaxies .",
    "we have recognized 31 interacting systems in the full s@xmath2 g sample used here .",
    "these contain examples of the ` m51-type ' and ` shrimp ' galaxies as classified by @xcite .",
    "equal mass interactions are also represented . however , probably none of our interactions would be classified as ` assembling ' in the classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the common picture of galaxy evolution where the galaxy assembly took place at high redshifts .",
    "however , among the ten merger systems in the s@xmath2 g sample there are a few which could be classified as ` assembling ' ( figure  [ fig7 ] ; ngc 337 , ngc 1487 )",
    ". our complete sample of nearby galaxies should again be useful in future studies that want to compare the frequency of galaxy assembly at higher redshifts to the current epoch ( assuming the same rest wavelength , _ jwst _ miri sensitivity should be sufficient to detect similarly bright features out to a @xmath35 of about 0.30.4 and future detectors may be able to push this limit into even higher redshifts where most of the galaxy assembly took place ) .",
    "interactions and mergers were also searched for in visible light images in a parallel project @xcite . only 69 per cent of the interactions / mergers in our sample are classified as such in the visible light images .",
    "the difference can be explained by different classification criteria used , and the larger imaged areas in the visible light images .",

    "the shell structure is very faint and not visible without doing a deeper analysis involving subtraction of the smooth light , which we did not do ( most features of the outer region are visible in the non - smoothed versions of the image , as we paid attention mostly to areas outside the easily visible galaxy discs or spheroids ) .",
    "similarly , images of ngc  5018 require unsharp - masking for the shell features to become clearly visible within the luminous body of the galaxy .",
    "only three polar ring candidate galaxies were detected among the s@xmath2 g sample galaxies .",
    "of these , ngc  660 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc  5122 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are known to be polar ring galaxies , while ngc  681 is not known to be a polar ring galaxy .",
    "the detection of a polar ring in this galaxy is uncertain due to the thin and large disc that dissects the luminous halo of this galaxy .",
    "even an image where the underlying disc / bulge component has been subtracted , can not reveal with certainty whether this feature is a ring in the galaxy plane or a polar ring . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting that the well - known polar ring galaxy ngc  2685 was not detected in the s@xmath2 g 3.6 @xmath1 m image .",
    "this is likely so because the polar ring is actually within the main body of the galaxy when looking at it with the histogram equalization scale in ds9 .",
    "it only shows up as a loop - like feature with the logarithmic intensity scale .",
    "polar rings are also less obvious in the older stellar population revealed at 3.6  @xmath1 m .",
    "there are probably other polar rings in the sample at unfavorable orientations and thus they were not detected .",
    "the loopy features in ngc  5134 are probably part of an outer ring @xcite .",
    "also , based on the findings of @xcite we would have expected to find more than one polar ring among the s0 galaxies as @xcite found a few per cent of all field s0 galaxies to have polar rings .",
    "other polar rings have been found in the s@xmath2 g sample galaxies ngc  2748 , ngc  6870 , and ngc  7465 , by @xcite .",
    "their tentative contours are marked in the appendices of @xcite .",
    "however , those three polar rings are exceedingly subtle and/or hard to interpret",
    ". therefore , they may actually not be polar rings .",
    "this is the position adopted in this paper .",
    "in addition to the outer features , we also checked for nearby companions that were visible in the 3.6  @xmath1 m images ( usually within about 10 arcminutes of the sample galaxies ) by checking for their systemic velocities in ned .",
    "a galaxy was called a companion if it was within @xmath22600  km  s@xmath11 of the sample galaxy in systemic velocity .",
    "because the images cover an arbitrary extent of space , and more in some directions than in others , some companion galaxies were missed in these images .",
    "we also present statistics of detected and confirmed companion galaxies versus the 3.6 @xmath1 m luminosity and the t - type in figures  [ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] , respectively .",
    "companions appear to be found most frequently around galaxies with absolute 3.6 @xmath1 m ab magnitudes around @xmath124  @xmath125 , possibly because they are the brightest galaxies in the sample and thus are expected to have the brightest companions that are easy to detect , and t - types around @xmath26 and 2 , corresponding to hubble classes e@xmath27 and sab .",
    "companions have also been searched for in visible light images of s@xmath2 g galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the companion definition criteria were different .",
    "for example , the velocity difference between the companion and the host galaxy was constrained to be less than @xmath22200 km  s@xmath11 in the visible light based search .",
    "in addition , the search area was more limited in the 3.6 @xmath1 m images , the 3.6 @xmath1 m companion selection includes uncertain cases , and the visible light sample includes 477 more galaxies , so the two samples are not comparable ( only 64 per cent of the s@xmath2 g galaxies that we classified as potentially having companions in the 3.6 @xmath1 m images are listed as having companions in the visible light images ) .",
    "it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions regarding the existence of companions in the s@xmath2 g images , partly because of the limitations of the depth , coverage , and size of the sample .",
    "we estimate that in our survey we pick up in several cases faint features not readily seen in standard shallow visible light images .",
    "targeted deep optical imaging may go deeper in several other cases .",
    "for example , we do not detect the faint loops around ngc  4013 @xcite and ngc  5907 @xcite , partly because the field of view ( fov ) of our irac observations is not large enough .",
    "for other galaxies , such as the eight galaxies with very faint optical features discussed in @xcite , who used an uncalibrated luminance filter covering most of the visible light wavelength regime , the score is mixed .",
    "for some of the galaxies again the fov is relatively small ( e.g. , ngc  3521 and ngc  5055 ) , while for others a few red faint features are detected ( e.g. , the companion of ngc  7531 already discussed in @xcite @xcite , and the extensions of ngc  4651 ) , while for yet others we miss some of the outer features readily seen in galex data , which must hence be composed of young stellar populations without counterparts in the near - infrared ( e.g. , the outer disc of ngc  7531 itself ) .",
    "we have made the first attempt to utilize the information from the detected faint outer region features to constrain the evolution of galaxies over their lifetimes .",
    "we do this by comparing the outer region features in the 3.6 @xmath1 m images to similar features around galaxies in zoom re - simulations of cosmological galaxy evolution simulations .",
    "we have analysed a sample of 33 simulated galaxies from @xcite . in that work",
    "each galaxy was simulated with a zoom re - simulation technique described in detail in @xcite .",
    "star formation followed a schmidt law with an exponent of 1.5 ( above a gas density threshold of 0.03 m@xmath126 pc@xmath127 ) .",
    "@xcite also took into account kinetic supernova feedback and mass loss from evolved stars . the exact star formation and feedback prescriptions probably affect the location and magnitude of outer disc asymmetries .",
    "we are still missing substantial physics and numerical resolution to fully model realistic galaxies .",
    "the spatial physical resolution was 150 pc , and the mass resolution 1.5 @xmath128 for gas and star particles , and 3 @xmath129 for dark matter particles .",
    "the 33 simulated haloes from @xcite are a large set of high resolution zoom re - simulations , with various galaxy formation histories that give rise to various morphologies during their evolution that is followed to @xmath130 , and therefore they form a good set for a comparison between observed features and those forming in simulations .",
    "the simulated galaxies were selected to have a mass between 2.7 @xmath131 and 2 @xmath132 m@xmath126 at @xmath133 , and as being in an isolated environment at @xmath133 .",
    "they have a wide range of formation histories , from galaxies with recent major mergers to galaxies with no merger with a mass ratio greater than 1:10 in the last 9 gyr .",
    "this resulted in a wide range of morphologies at @xmath133 , even if 85 per cent of the sample has a bulge - to - total stellar mass ratio smaller than 0.5 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their final stellar mass ranges from 1.7 @xmath134 to 2 @xmath131 m@xmath126 .    to compare these simulated galaxies from @xcite to s@xmath2 g data , we computed mock 3.6  @xmath1 m images for all 33 galaxies , at seven inclinations ranging from 0@xmath18 to 90@xmath18 .",
    "the mock 3.6  @xmath1 m images were computed using the pegase.2 stellar evolution code @xcite , assuming a kroupa initial mass function from 0.1 to 120 m@xmath126 ( we did not include any dust contribution because at 3.6 @xmath1 m dust is not expected to play a significant role and can be excluded in the modelling ) .",
    "each image corresponds to 100 x 100 kpc in size ( with a similar total depth of 100 kpc ) .",
    "each pixel represents 143 x 143 pc , which in terms of irac pixels corresponds to a galaxy situated 24 mpc away ( the s@xmath2 g sample galaxies are at distances of 1 to 60 mpc , although almost all of them are within 40 mpc ) .",
    "we added an expected background of 0.15 mjy / sr which corresponds to a medium background level in irac images .",
    "we then converted the image into mock irac 30 second frames in electron units .",
    "next we generated a poisson variate for the flux value from idl s randomu function , and added in the readnoise contribution which is 14.6 electrons .",
    "we then added noise to an artificial skydark , using a typical median value of 0.05 mjy / sr or 38 electrons , and subtracted it from the noise - added galaxy image .",
    "finally we converted the image to mjy / sr , and made eight realizations of these images , corresponding to the irac observing depth , and took the median of them to form the final image .",
    "we selected each of the 33 simulated galaxies in a random order but with such inclinations that the observed s@xmath2 g galaxy inclination distribution was reproduced .",
    "we then classified the inclined galaxy mock images in exactly the same way as we classified the s@xmath2 g irac channel 1 images .",
    "the detected outer disc features in the simulated galaxies are shown in figures  [ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] .",
    "we have looked at the time series of simulations .",
    "it is often not obvious what the causes of the outer disc asymmetries or extensions are , but probable culprits include ongoing interactions , asymmetric spiral structure resulting from a simple companion galaxy fly - by 24 gyrs ago ( comparable to the age estimate of visible interaction signs from abnormal colours or fine structure by @xcite @xcite ; however , it should be noted that such a flyby does not always result in detected asymmetric structure ) , ` chaotic ' disc reformation after a recent merger ( the old disc was destroyed by the merger , and a new disc is still in the process of settling down and therefore it appears asymmetric or has extensions ) , and long - lived ( 5 gyrs or more ) asymmetric spiral structure ( this may be related to asymmetries in external gas accretion ) .",
    "the best way forward is to statistically compare large samples of observed and model galaxies to explore a range of possible origins .",
    "future models may also provide other clues to the origin of these features , such as colours , clumpiness measurements , etc .    , width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    we find asymmetric outer discs in 11/33 galaxies or 33@xmath228 per cent , and we find a similar fraction of outer disc extensions ( 33 per cent ) .",
    "these numbers are higher than the fractions of outer disc asymmetries and extensions in the s@xmath2 g sample .",
    "possible reasons for this discrepancy include the fact that the simulation sample consists of mostly late - type disc galaxies , whereas the s@xmath2 g sample has several earlier - type galaxies .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig10 ] , asymmetries are more prevalent ( around 25 per cent ) among late - type disc galaxies than in the s@xmath2 g sample as a whole . also , our current inability to model the physics of star formation is likely to affect details of asymmetry formation .",
    "for example , if the star formation gas density threshold used in the simulations was higher , then the visible disc would be detected to smaller radii where the galaxy is more symmetric .",
    "therefore , the simulated galaxies may allow star formation further out than real galaxies .",
    "put another way , the fraction of asymmetries in the outer regions of real galaxies may be 33 per cent , but without star formation in the outer parts , a fraction of the asymmetries would not be visible . also , outer discs may have an additional condition for star formation , other than a critical density , such as needing to form molecules at low metallicity .",
    "in fact , anything that makes a real galaxy less able to form stars in the far outer part than the simulated galaxy would seem to lower the asymmetry fraction for real galaxies .",
    "the reason for the high fraction of extensions in the simulated sample is less clear , but it could mean that some parameters in the simulations require further adjustments to make the simulated galaxies look more realistic as a whole .",
    "we found a companion and an interaction in only one of the 33 galaxies ( this is partly a selection effect because the simulated galaxies were selected to be isolated at @xmath130 ) .",
    "this paper presents discoveries and classifications of near - infrared - detected stellar features outside the main bodies of galaxies ( at and outside of @xmath6 ) in the complete sample of 2,352 s@xmath2 g galaxies .",
    "the detected features include asymmetries , extensions , polar rings , warps , shells , tidal tails , and interaction / merger morphologies .",
    "we also tabulate nearby companion galaxies , confirmed by a reasonable systemic velocity difference of @xmath22600  km  s@xmath11 in ned , as seen in the 3.6 @xmath1 m images .",
    "this list of outer disc features is conceived to be an important data base for future quantitative studies of them when higher s / n observations become available .",
    "we also give statistics on the features we detected .",
    "the fraction of asymmetric galaxies in the s@xmath2 g sample is about 20 per cent .",
    "if the @xmath24  20 per cent fraction of galaxies with asymmetries in their outer discs is overwhelmingly due to interactions , it may imply that half of all galaxies have interactions that leave visible signs for @xmath24  4 gyrs after the beginning of the interaction .",
    "however , an internal origin for some of these asymmetries is also possible , e.g. , due to dark halo asymmetry induced lopsidedness .",
    "we found that the number of asymmetric galaxies increases with t - type , peaking in late hubble types ( t - types 510 ) , as would be expected , because the later type galaxies are more susceptible to disturbances due to their kinematics and stellar distributions .",
    "surprisingly , we find shells in galaxies of fairly late t - types , although shells are commonly believed to be primarily features of early - type galaxies .    in a first attempt to utilize our faint outer feature detections to constrain galaxy evolution on billions of years time scale , we have also classified galaxies in cosmological zoom re - simulations as seen at @xmath130 , and converted to irac - like images . we find a larger outer disc asymmetry fraction ( by a factor of 1.5 ) in the simulated galaxy sample than in s@xmath2 g , which may be due to selection effects and our incomplete understanding of star formation thresholds .",
    "the simulations suggest interactions and mergers , asymmetric external gas accretion , unfinished disc reformation , and asymmetric spiral structure as causes for asymmetry .",
    "however , it is difficult to quantify the relative importance of these effects .",
    "finally , the simulations suggest that asymmetries may be visible for at least 4 gyrs after an interaction or merger .",
