    "<S> however for weak repumping , with @xmath5 not significantly larger then @xmath64 it is still possible to achieve temperatures not much higher than that predicted when pump recoil was neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially promising for the implementation of supercooling in realistic experimental systems . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath86 is more or less a worst case senerio , since by using a dipole allowed transition for the relaxation from the auxiliary state to the excited state , one could in principle use a much reduced frequency with correspondingly small recoil .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a theoretical proposal for supercooling atoms in one - dimension along the axis of an optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the superradiant emission was observed to lead to an increased cooling rate and to a potentially extremely low final temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate temperatures were seen to be constrained by the relaxation of the atomic dipole , and could be orders of magnitude less than the limits for single atom cooling that are constrained by the cavity linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> this system is an example of many - body laser cooling in which all motional degrees of freedom of a collective system are simultaneously cooled and in which macroscopic spin - spin correlations are essential and must develop for the cooling mechanism to work . </S>",
    "<S> it will be necessary to consider extensions to understand how cooling in all three dimensions may be achieved , and to consider realistic models for real atoms that may involve elaborate repumping schemes .    </S>",
