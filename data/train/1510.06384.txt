    "knowledge of the atomic rearrangements occurring during chemical reactions is crucial for understanding reactivity .",
    "it allows designing new reactions and optimizing existing ones . in recent years , approaches toward interactive reactivity studies@xcite have been introduced .",
    "we developed haptic quantum chemistry@xcite and real - time quantum chemistry@xcite to actively interact with some molecular system under consideration and perceive its immediate ( quantum - mechanical ) response .",
    "this immersion into the molecular world is enabled by immediate feedback of quantum - chemical calculations , which is of paramount importance to guide operators during the ( interactive ) exploration of molecular systems .",
    "interactivity enables chemists to understand reactivity more intuitively and more efficiently than with traditional tools .",
    "in other approaches toward the interaction with molecular systems , the emphasis is on the possibility to steer simulations in real time .",
    "for example , in the field of interactive molecular dynamics , stone et al .  allowed operators to drive classical molecular dynamics simulations toward events that would happen too rarely or",
    "not at all otherwise@xcite .",
    "this field was recently extended to _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics by luehr et al.@xcite another approach was implemented by bosson et al.,@xcite who applied a non - iterative semi - empirical quantum - chemical method that instantaneously optimizes a molecular structure set up with their molecular editor samson@xcite .",
    "such structure relaxation approaches to quickly generate reasonable molecular structures ( often based on classical force fields ) are becoming a standard tool for structure generation attempts in such graphical user interfaces ( cf .",
    "for another example the avogadro program @xcite ) .",
    "real - time quantum chemistry@xcite allows exploring the born  oppenheimer potential energy surface interactively in real time to gain intuitive insight into reactivity .",
    "such real - time reactivity explorations rely on two types of feedback .",
    "firstly , operators can actively manipulate the molecular structure , for example , with a haptic device that allows them to move atoms while experiencing the quantum - chemical force acting on them .",
    "the haptic feedback provides an immediate and intuitive understanding of which parts of the potential energy surface are accessible ( at a given temperature or energy ) and indicates how a molecular system is prepared to react .",
    "secondly , the operator can directly observe the effect of structure manipulations on the molecular system as a whole .",
    "this visual feedback relies on a continuously running real - time geometry optimization that drives the molecular system to nearby local minima .",
    "both types of feedback rely on quantum - mechanical forces calculated in real time by fast electronic structure methods .    for an optimal immersion into reactivity explorations , such real - time feedback needs to be reliable in different aspects .",
    "from the operator s perspective , feedback must always be provided independently of the current state of the system , even if its exact calculation is not possible at all .",
    "with respect to accuracy , feedback must give a qualitatively correct description of molecular behavior or , if such a description is unavailable , it must not lead the operator to inaccessible areas of configuration space .",
    "recently , we demonstrated the application of real - time reactivity studies described by the non - self - consistent density - functional tight - binding ( dftb ) method.@xcite dftb@xcite is a non - iterative method featuring constant execution times and therefore delivers forces at a constant frequency .",
    "non - iterative methods such as dftb are , however , too approximate to describe complex molecular systems reliably .",
    "hence , for most systems the application of self - consistent field ( scf ) methods is required .",
    "however , the application of scf methods introduces an additional layer of complexity due to their iterative nature . with iterative methods",
    ", it can not be guaranteed that the forces will be delivered at a constant frequency or that they will be delivered at all ( if convergence can not be achieved ) .",
    "if , for a given structure , the execution time of the electronic structure optimization is incompatible with the real - time requirement , it will be necessary to freeze the molecular structure until the optimization converges as done by luehr et al .  in the field of steered _",
    "ab initio _",
    "molecular dynamics.@xcite however , in the context of real - time reactivity explorations , immersion and hence interactivity would be jeopardized by freezing haptic and visual feedback .    to maintain interactivity in real - time reactivity explorations based on iterative methods ,",
    "the feedback can not ( and need not ) reflect the exact quantum - mechanical forces directly because they might be provided only intermittently . in this work",
    ", we present a strategy that addresses this issue and allows performing interactive quantum - chemical reactivity studies with scf methods .",
    "in interactive chemical reactivity studies , information about the behavior of a molecular system during operator - induced structure manipulations is conveyed to the operator by real - time rendering of data generated by electronic structure calculations .",
    "rendering in this context entails the complete process of transforming raw data into data perceptible by human senses .    to maintain interactivity",
    ", the rendering process must be performed in real time .",
    "depending on the sense addressed by the rendering , different real - time requirements must be fulfilled . addressing the visual and haptic sensory systems impose different requirements for the update rate that is to be maintained . achieving certain minimum update rates",
    "translates into maximum time intervals that are allowed for the data generation and rendering process .",
    "the time interval available for the calculation of a result is therefore defined by the senses addressed by the feedback mechanism . for a setting where feedback consists of rendering molecular forces and visualizing structural changes upon manipulations by the operator , table  [ tab : senses ]",
    "gives an overview of the imposed time limits and the types of calculation to be performed in the available time .",
    ".senses addressed in the haptic quantum chemistry setting and their implications for quantum - chemical calculations . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     without surrogate potentials , the maximal value of @xmath0 needs to be adapted to the system size .",
    "the larger the molecular structures , the longer the execution time of the electronic structure optimization is and , at constant structure - relaxation frequency , the more steps are to be performed based on the same forces .",
    "applying surrogate potentials decouples @xmath0 and the size of the system , and therefore allows for larger values of @xmath0 . in this case , the maximal values for @xmath0 rather depend on the local shape of the potential , i.e. , of the second derivative of the surrogate potential , and on the frequency at which the structure relaxation is performed . by default",
    ", our framework will employ @xmath1 independent of the molecular system size if surrogate potentials are applied .",
    "a solution is presented to mediate between the inherently unpredictable execution times of iterative electronic structure calculations and the time requirements of real - time feedback . in the context of real - time quantum chemistry ,",
    "such feedback relies on quantum - mechanical forces and must be generated at high frequencies that can not be guaranteed when iterative electronic structure methods are applied .",
    "the strategy followed in this work is to calculate the atomic forces from surrogate potentials that can easily be evaluated for molecular structures for which the electronic structure is still unknown . for consecutive molecular structures visited during real - time reactivity explorations , one or",
    "several surrogate potentials are generated from the electronic energy and its first and second derivatives to approximate the reference potential energy surface .",
    "surrogate potentials such as bounded quadratic potentials allow for a fast evaluation of forces compatible with real - time requirements .    to calculate forces at such high frequencies offers immediate benefits for real - time feedback in the form of on - the - fly structure relaxation and haptic force feedback .    in the context of structure relaxation , surrogate potentials",
    "avoid the need for special measures such as freezing the system when electronic structure calculations do not converge or are very time - consuming  the molecular structure will evolve toward the minimum of the surrogate potential and remain there until the surrogate potential is updated .",
    "consequently , the structural evolution can be performed faster ( translated into larger steps in the steepest - descent algorithm ) since the surrogate potentials guarantee to lead to a minimum . in particular",
    ", the step size of the structure relaxation algorithm does not need to be adjusted for different system sizes or calculation times .    for haptic feedback , the ability to update forces at 1  khz improves substantially on the responsiveness of force feedback upon structure manipulations by the operator .",
    "furthermore , in the case of non - converging calculations , the surrogate potential will drive the operator back to its minimum and hinder large manipulations from his part when insufficient information about the reference forces is available .",
    "the presented procedure is independent of the system size and is also advantageous when the execution time of the electronic structure calculation is constant and predictable . despite the additional computational time needed for the calculation of (",
    "approximate ) second derivatives , the application of surrogate potentials proves necessary and beneficial for interactive reactivity studies based on iterative methods .",
