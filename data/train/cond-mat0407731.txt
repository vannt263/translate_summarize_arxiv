    "<S> the geometry of the system has been known to play a crucial role in many aspects of critical behavior : the way of taking the thermodynamic limit may affect the occurrence of a phase transition , and critical exponents depend on spatial dimensionality non - trivially . </S>",
    "<S> these result in more stringent test on the universality by including universal critical amplitudes and amplitude relations obtained from the finite - size effects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> boundary condition is a important factor in determining the finite - size scalings .  in particular , aperiodic boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> may introduce interfaces to the systems and lead to a profound change in the scaling behaviorprivman2,wumc .  in this letter , we report the appearance of a new first - order transition induced by the interface of a 2d semi - infinite ising system . we consider the simplest system , an infinitely long ising cylinder defined on a square @xmath4 lattice with infinite @xmath5 and finite @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> to have the system with cylindrical geometry , we impose periodic or antiperiodic condition on the infinitely extended boundary rows , @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition on the couplings of the boundary spin variables @xmath10 along the @xmath11-axis is @xmath12 for periodically joined circumference ( pjc , hereafter ) , and the condition becomes @xmath13 for antiperiodically joined circumference ( ajc , hereafter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of the system with ajc contains the additional contribution from the interfacial tension in comparison with that of the system with pjclhlw , huang1 . to understand the differences in thermodynamic properties between the two boundary conditions , we analyze the distribution and the density of partition function zeros . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal some intriguing properties for the system with ajc of finite @xmath14 .     </S>",
    "<S> we already have a complete picture about the partition function zeros of the zero - field square ising model in the thermodynamic limit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fisher first showed that the partition function zeros , referred as fisher zeros , all lie on the unit circle , @xmath15 , in the complex plane of @xmath16 with the zero on the positive real axis , @xmath17 , corresponding to the critical point of ising transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , lu and wu obtained the density associated with the zeros on the unit circle analytically@xcite . based on these results , we study the finite - size scalings of fisher zeros for infinitely long ising cylinders . for the system with pjc , portions of the zeros , including the critical point , are always absent from the unit circle for finite @xmath14 , and the scaling behavior is given in the exact form . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the system with ajc , regardless the @xmath14 value , the zeros distribution always contain the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> then , by analyzing the cumulative distribution of fisher zeros around the critical point we show that the singular property of the critical point can be classified into two types : one is the first - order transition for a finite circumference , and the other is the second - order transition for an infinite circumference . </S>",
    "<S> the latter corresponds to the ising ferromagnetic phase transition , and the former is a new phase caused by the fluctuation of interface from ajc . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 from an infinitely long ising cylinder of finite @xmath14 , we encounter different situations for two different boundary conditions : @xmath19 for the case of pjc , only the second - order phase transition appears in the limit @xmath18 , and there is no phase transition in the intermediate stage @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 for the case of ajc , we first have the first - order phase transition which becomes weaker as @xmath14 increases and eventually reduces to a second - order phase transition in the limit @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is further verified by measuring the latent heat per site released in the first - order transition as @xmath2 .     </S>",
    "<S> the partition function of a plane square @xmath4 ising lattice with periodic or aperiodic boundary conditions can be expressed as the sum of four terms@xcite , but the sum reduces to one term in the limit of @xmath22 ( or @xmath23)@xmath24 . in this limit , the system becomes an infinitely long ising strip with finite width @xmath14 , and the corresponding free energy of the system per site per @xmath25 is @xmath26 , \\]]for the case of isotropic ferromagnetic couplings@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the possible @xmath27-values in the sum are half integers ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for pjc and integers ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 for ajc , and the function @xmath32 is given as @xmath33then , the loci of the fisher zeros can be obtained as the union of the solutions of the condition @xmath34with @xmath35 for all allowed @xmath27-values . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) , the value of @xmath39 for a given @xmath41-mode is in the range between @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the curve of @xmath44 obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) for various @xmath27-modes with @xmath45 is shown in fig . 1 .    for pjc , by including all allowed </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27-modes we obtain the range of @xmath38 as @xmath46 and @xmath47 $ ] for even @xmath14 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 for odd @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) for @xmath50 and 2(c ) for @xmath45 , the zeros distribution can be summarized as the followings : @xmath19 the zeros are absent from two arcs of the unit circle for even @xmath14 and from an arc for odd @xmath14 , and the zeros do not contain the critical point for both even and odd finite @xmath14 . @xmath51 by denoting the nearest zero to the critical point as @xmath52 , we obtain the opening angle between @xmath52 and the critical point as @xmath53 . to obtain the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath52 , </S>",
    "<S> we expand @xmath54 and @xmath55 as a power series of @xmath56 to obtain   @xmath57with the coefficients @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and etc . ; and @xmath61with the coefficients @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and etc .. from the finite - size scaling theory of the zeros ditributions , the leading finite - size scaling behavior of the imaginary part of a fisher zero labelled by @xmath65 is given as @xmath66where @xmath67 is the correlation - length exponent@xcite ; and the leading scaling behavior of the real part of the lowest zero @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69where @xmath70 is another critical exponent which is closely related to the shift exponent @xmath71 characterizing the shift of the specific - heat peak from the critical point@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the two values are the same as the results obtained by janke and kenna for a finite rectangular lattice with the brascamp - kunz boundary condition@xcite but different from those obtained by other boundary conditions@xcite .    for ajc </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the range of @xmath38 as @xmath74  with @xmath49 for even @xmath14 and @xmath75 $ ] for odd @xmath14 . thus , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) for @xmath50 and 2(d ) for @xmath45 , the zeros distribution is absent from an arc of the unit circle for odd @xmath14 and fills the unit circle completely for even @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the critical point is one of the loci of the zeros for both even and odd @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> then , a question naturally arises : what is the non - analytic property associated with the zero at the critical point </S>",
    "<S> ? this can not be the second - order phase transition which occurs only in the limit @xmath18 . to determine the nature of the non - analyticity , we study the functional form of the cumulative distribution of the zeros@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative distribution of zeros , @xmath76 , is defined as the total number of fisher zeros in the interval @xmath77 $ ] of the unit circle . by expressing in terms of the zeros density @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath79here we always take the normalization as @xmath80 for any width @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown@xcitethat the zeros density @xmath81 near the critical point , @xmath82 , behaves as @xmath83 in a second - order phase transition for which the specific heat diverges as @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> thence , the corresponding cumulative distribution of zeros is @xmath85 . in @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> ising transition for which we have @xmath86 , the density @xmath87 was shown to vanish linearly as @xmath88 near the critical point@xcite , and the corresponding @xmath89 obtained by the integration of @xmath87 given by ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are shown as a solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . for the first - order transition </S>",
    "<S> , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath87 to the critical point was shown to take the form , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 proportional to the latent heat@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the behavior of @xmath92 is @xmath93     for the system of an infinitely long ising cylinder , the value of @xmath94 is proportional to the sum of the lengths of the curves @xmath95 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , over all possible @xmath27-values up to a given @xmath38 value with @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the symmetry , @xmath97 , we may restrict the @xmath98-values to the interval @xmath99 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then , by using the normalization condition @xmath80 we write @xmath100where @xmath101 is the length of the curve @xmath102 up to a given @xmath38 value , @xmath103and @xmath104 is the sum of the lengths of all the curves , @xmath105our numerical result gives @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the value of @xmath104 is linearly proportional to the width @xmath14 and independent of boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results of @xmath107 for both pjc and ajc with @xmath108 are shown as circles in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . there are two remarks on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 worthy to be mentioned : @xmath109 the differences in @xmath76 between ajc and pjc for @xmath45 and @xmath110 are shown in the up - left corner of fig . 3 , and it indicates the difference vanishes very quickly as @xmath14 increases . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath111 by comparing with @xmath89 shown by the solid line , we know @xmath76 converges to @xmath112 very quickly as @xmath14 increases .    for the system with ajc , </S>",
    "<S> the critical point is one of the zeros for both even and odd @xmath14 , and the cumulative distribution of zeros in the interval @xmath113 is contributed solely by the zero mode @xmath114 . in this interval of @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath115 . by completing the integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 13 ) for @xmath114 , we have   @xmath116this result yield @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by comparing eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) with eq . ( 11 ) we may conclude the following properties for the system with ajc : @xmath19 the system exhibits a first - order transition for finite @xmath14 . @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature always locates at the critical point @xmath118 of @xmath1 ising transition independent of the value of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath119 the latent heat released by the transition is inversely proportional to the width @xmath14 .     to obtain the exact amount of the latent heat released in the transition , we can measure the discontinuity of the internal energy at the transition point . the dimensionless internal energy density @xmath120 is defined as @xmath121 . by rewriting the free energy density of eq . ( 1 ) as @xmath122 , \\]]with @xmath123 , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> f(p,\\beta ) & = & z\\left ( z^{2}+1-\\cos \\frac{2\\pi p}{l}\\right ) ^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\]]we may obtain @xmath120 by first completing the integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 17 ) and then performing the derivatives with respect to @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> however , to avoid any ill - defined result we have to be very cautious of continuity for the integrand . for conncreteness </S>",
    "<S> , we proceed first with the derivative and then the integration . by using the technique of contour integration </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath125note that the above equality holds only when the condition @xmath126 is met , and this condition ensures the continuity of the integrand . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have @xmath127with @xmath128    for pjc , the functional values of @xmath129 satisfy the inequality @xmath130 , and the internal energy of eq . ( 20 ) is a continuous function of @xmath124 . for ajc </S>",
    "<S> , the functional values of @xmath129 also  satisfy the condition @xmath131 with one exceptional point locating at @xmath114 and @xmath132 for which we have @xmath133@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for ajc we may expect to have the mismatch of the left and right derivatives of the free energy at @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity @xmath134 defined as the differences between @xmath135 and @xmath136 exactly is the latent heat per site released by the transition . since the zero mode of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 21 ) is solely responsible for the discontinuity , we have @xmath137 .\\]]this yields @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the latent heat scales as @xmath56 , and this agrees with the result obtained from the analysis of the zeros .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the distribution of fisher zeros in the complex @xmath139 plane for an infinitely long ising strip with finite width @xmath14 joined periodically or antiperiodically . for periodically joined circumferece , </S>",
    "<S> the the leading finite - size scaling behavior for the distribution of fisher zeros give the exact values of the correlation - length and shift exponents , @xmath67 and @xmath70 , as @xmath72 and @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> for antiperiodically joined circumference , the system contains the interface , and the fluctuation of the interface renders the critical point of ising transition to be non - analytic in thermodynamic quantities for any width @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the non - analytic associated with the critical point is identified as the first - order phase transition for finite @xmath14 . because of the existence of the interface , the system can not be identified as an effective one - dimensional system with short - range hamiltonian , and the appearence of the first - order transition does not contradict with the mermin - wigner theorem@xcite.the latent heat released by the transition scales exactly as @xmath56 with the the exact amount @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as @xmath14 increases , the strength of the first - order transition decreases , and eventually the system exhibits the second - order phase transition in the limit of @xmath18 . </S>"
