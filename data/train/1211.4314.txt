    "the _ gambler s ruin problem _ is a classical subject of probability theory . consider a random walker on a one - dimensional lattice hopping to the right with probability @xmath0 and left with @xmath1 in a single time step .",
    "the problem seeks statistical properties of duration @xmath2 , the time at which the walker from @xmath3 first hits the origin .",
    "( of course , @xmath2 is a random variable . ) not only a model of bankruptcy @xcite and gambling @xcite , but queuing theory @xcite and genetic algorithm @xcite are concerned with the gambler s ruin problem .",
    "a standard textbook of probability theory @xcite gives detailed instructions on this problem .",
    "the central quantity is the probability @xmath4 that the walker at position @xmath3 first hits the origin after time @xmath5 . as the solution of the equation @xmath6 with initial and boundary conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 the coefficient before @xmath11 is the number of different paths from @xmath3 hitting the origin first at time @xmath5 , and it is connected with the reflection principle of a random walk @xcite .",
    "obviously , @xmath12 holds when @xmath13 , because @xmath14 .    in statistical physics , a similar problem is called the _ first passage problem _ @xcite .",
    "this is a more general problem than the ruin problem , in that the state space of a random walker ( or a diffusion particle ) is not necessarily a one - dimensional lattice but higher - dimensional spaces and networks .",
    "many fields in statistical physics , including reaction - rate theory @xcite , neuron dynamics @xcite , and economic analysis @xcite , have been formulated and analyzed based on first - passage properties .",
    "the present paper analyzes an extended form of the classical ruin problem ; a random walker hops to the right with probability @xmath0 , to the left with @xmath15 , and it does not hop with probability @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] schematically shows the problem .",
    "the only difference from the original ruin problem is that the _ halting _ probability @xmath17 is introduced .",
    "the difference seems very small , but the results become quite distinct . in fact , the solution of non halting case ( @xmath18 ) is superseded by a formula involving a gauss hypergeometric function in halting case @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , moment analysis and asymptotic ( long - time ) behavior are developed .    , and to the left with @xmath15",
    "; hopping does not occur with probability @xmath17 .",
    "( @xmath20 . ) the problem focuses on statistical properties of the duration @xmath2 , which is the time the walker first hits the origin . ]",
    "as in the classical problem described in the previous section , let @xmath21 be the probability that the walker starting from @xmath3 has duration @xmath22 . @xmath21 satisfies the equation @xmath23 with initial and boundary conditions @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , it is hard to solve this equation directly , and we take an another way by employing a classical result effectively .    to calculate @xmath21 ,",
    "we classify the walker s paths according to the number of hopping .",
    "we count the paths consisting of @xmath26 hops and @xmath27 halts .",
    "first , the different patterns of putting @xmath27 halts into @xmath5 steps are given by @xmath28 in total , where ` @xmath29 ' ( not @xmath5 ) comes from the fact that a halting step never comes to the last @xmath5-th step .",
    "next , if we focus on only the hopping steps ( and ignore the halting steps ) , the paths are reduced to those of classical ruin problem ; the probability that the walker from @xmath3 hits the origin after @xmath26 hops is given by @xmath30 .",
    "thus the total occurring probability of a path with @xmath26 hops and @xmath27 halts is @xmath31 summing up all @xmath26 , we get @xmath32 in the third equality , the range of summation is changed ; the terms corresponding to @xmath33 have no contribution because @xmath34 . in the last equality we change the summation variable as @xmath35 .",
    "this result can be also obtained by solving directly the equation @xmath23 with conditions @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "we further proceed with calculation ; we rewrite factorials using gamma functions , which is a preparatory step toward a hypergeometric function . employing some formulas of the gamma function ,",
    "one obtains @xmath38 ( see appendix [ apdx : a ] for the calculation in detail . )",
    "the probability @xmath21 is expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "this is an explicit form of the solution of our problem .",
    "this solution can not be deduced from the non - halting solution . the hypergeometric function in eq .",
    "is a _ genuine _ hypergeometric function , in the sense that it can not be expressed using simpler functions .",
    "( it has been studied that some hypergeometric functions have tractable expressions , e.g. , @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite )    we comment here on the convergence of the sum in eq .",
    "at first sight , it seems to diverge when @xmath42 . by using the pochhammer symbol @xmath43 instead of gamma functions ,",
    "@xmath44 if @xmath45 , @xmath46 holds automatically because @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    ", if @xmath48 , either @xmath49 or @xmath50 becomes zero for @xmath51 .",
    "( more precisely , the former becomes zero when @xmath3 and @xmath5 are of same parity , and the latter becomes zero otherwise . )",
    "the sum consists of a finite number of terms in reality , so one does not need to worry about the convergence .",
    "the exact solution is difficult to understand intuitively .",

    "the walker moves to the left by a length @xmath60 on average in a single hop . in other words",
    ", @xmath57 is a mean velocity of the walker toward the origin .",
    "hence , it takes @xmath73 time steps on average to reach the origin .",
    "the moment generating function looks too complicated to calculate higher moments by differentiation .",
    "alternatively , we provide another calculation method for moments of the duration @xmath2 .",
    "we start from the difference equation for @xmath21 : @xmath74 multiply @xmath5 and take summation for @xmath5 to get @xmath75 the left - hand side can be expressed as @xmath76 the last equality uses @xmath77 , which means that a random walker surely hits the origin .",
    "( this normalization breaks if @xmath78see the discussion of total probability of ruin in sec .",

    "we have a difference equation @xmath79 a particular solution is given by @xmath80 , and the characteristic equation @xmath81 admits the two roots @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "bottom - up ' method calculates higher moments inductively , and generally @xmath98 becomes a polynomial of degree @xmath99 .",
