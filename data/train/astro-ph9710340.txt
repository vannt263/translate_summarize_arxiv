    "iso _ and scuba , and forthcoming facilities and experiments such as _ sirtf _ , sofia , _ first _ and _",
    "planck_.    as a matter of fact , our knowledge of the early epochs of galaxies has recently increased thanks to the richness and precision of the observational evidence obtained by uv / visible / nir surveys of high  redshift objects ( lilly _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; ellis _ et al .",

    "_ 1996 ; steidel _ et al .",

    "the pattern of galaxy evolution which emerges from these data can be summarized as follows : i ) faint galaxy counts show the presence of a large number of blue objects , well in excess of no  evolution expectations ( williams _ et al .",
    "ii ) these blue objects are `` sub@xmath4 '' galaxies undergoing strong bursts of star formation ( lilly _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; ellis _ et al .",
    "iii ) the fraction of these blue objects with unclassified / peculiar morphologies showing signs of tidal interaction and merging ( abraham _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) increases from local samples to the hst high  resolution observations of the medium deep survey ( griffiths _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) and hubble deep field ( williams _ et al .",
    "iv ) the global star formation rate ( hereafter sfr ) of the universe declined by a factor of about ten since redshift @xmath3 ( lilly _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; madau _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; sawicki _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; connolly _ et al .",
    "v ) finally , this high sfr seems to be correlated to the decrease of the cold  gas comoving density associated with damped lyman@xmath5 systems between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( storrie  lombardi _ et al .",
    "these results nicely match a picture in which star formation in bursts triggered by interaction / merging consumes the gas content of galaxies as time goes on .",
    "it is common wisdom that such a qualitative scenario is expected within the paradigm of hierarchical growth of structures . the implementation of hierarchical galaxy formation in semi ",
    "analytic models quantitatively substantiates this view and may further suggest that we have seen the bulk of star formation and understood the broad features of galaxy formation ( baugh _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this seemingly consistent view is entirely based on visible / nir observations which only probe the rest ",
    "frame uv / visible light of high@xmath1 objects .",
    "the total amount of energy released by star formation should be estimated by summing up the uv / visible / nir light of stellar populations directly escaping from galaxies , _ and _ the part which has been absorbed by dust and re  emitted in the ir / submm wavelength range .",
    "the corrections needed to account for optical extinction by dust are rather uncertain and could easily induce an upward revision of the high  redshift sfr deduced from rest  frame uv / visible observations by factors of a few .",
    "moreover , a significant fraction of star formation might be completely hidden in heavily  extinguished galaxies which are missed by the above  mentionned surveys . even for normal objects like spiral galaxies",
    ", the fraction of energy emitted in the ir can amount to 30 % of the optical , and this can increase to more than 95 % for ultraluminous starbursts . as a matter of fact , the ir / submm range might be more adequate than the optical for observing high  redshift , starburst galaxies provided they are dusty .",
    "frame ir / submm spectrum of dust heated by a young stellar population peaks between 50 to 100 @xmath0 m , pointing out the submm range as particularly relevant for the search of primeval , high  redshift galaxies .    at this time , we know very little about the `` optically  dark '' side of galaxy evolution .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "satellite has given the first complete survey of fir galaxy properties , in four bands between 12 and 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "many studies have emphasized the wide variety of ir luminosities , from `` normal spirals '' to `` mild starbursts '' , and finally to the `` luminous ir galaxies '' ( hereafter ligs ) , mostly interacting systems , and the spectacular `` ultraluminous ir galaxies '' ( hereafter uligs ) , which are mergers ( sanders and mirabel 1996 ; clements _ et al . _",
    "unfortunately , while we have learned from _",
    "iras _ that about one third of the bolometric luminosity of the local universe is released in the ir / submm ( soifer and neugebauer 1991 ) , we know very little about galaxy evolution in this wavelength range .",
    "faint galaxy counts and redshift surveys down to flux densities @xmath8 mjy ( at 60 @xmath0 m ) do not probe deeper than @xmath9 ( ashby _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; clements _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a ) .",
    "these surveys seem to show a strong luminosity and/or density evolution of _ iras _ sources , but it is difficult to extrapolate this trend to higher redshifts on a firm ground . in spite of its observational limits , _",
    "iras _ has also revealed the existence of _ iras _ 10214 + 4724 , a very peculiar , `` hyperluminous '' galaxy at @xmath10 ( rowan  robinson _ et al . _",
    "1991a ) , though this object is likely affected by lensing ( eisenhardt _ et al .",
    "it is expected that the _ iso _ satellite will complete and detail this picture , in a broader wavelength range from a few @xmath0 m to 200 @xmath0 m .",
    "other projects , such as _ sirtf _ , will give access to better sensitivity and imaging capabilities .",
    "the properties of galaxies in the submm range are sensitive to the spectral characteristics of dust , especially its emissivity at large wavelengths which is not constrained by _ iras _ observations alone .",
    "with respect to the relative wealth of data in the fir , the submm emission of galaxies is poorly known .",
    "the observational literature gathers the submm fluxes of only a few tens galaxies which have been measured from ground  based or aircraft  borne instruments .",
    "these observations are difficult and some of the estimates of the amount of energy released in this range happen to be strongly discrepant ( e.g. chini _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; stark _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; eales _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; chini and krgel 1993 )",
    ". however , the observational situation will soon evolve with the start of scuba operations ( and later , with sofia and especially _ first _ ) .",
    "about twenty counterparts of radiogalaxies and quasars have already been observed at submm / mm wavelengths ( see e.g. hughes _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "although their evolutionary status is not fully understood , these objects give a first flavour of the future deep surveys which will be achieved by forthcoming instruments .",
    "theoretical modelling is needed to optimise observational strategies and also to help assess the point source contribution of the forthcoming cmb satellites map , and especially _",
    "planck_. these experiments aim at mapping the anisotropies of the submm / mm sky on scales well below the degree . on these scales ,",
    "the separation of the various foregrounds and backgrounds which superimpose to the fluctuations of the cmb is more difficult than for the 7@xmath11 field of view of the very successful _ cobe_/dmr experiment . in the case of _ planck _ , preliminary studies have shown that several thousands of galaxies should be detected at several wavelengths between 400 @xmath0 m and 1 cm .",
    "the epoch of galaxy formation can also be observed by its imprint on the background radiation which is produced by the line  of  sight accumulation of extragalactic sources .",
    "the search for the `` cosmic optical background '' ( hereafter cob ) currently gives only upper limits .",
    "nevertheless , the shallowing of the faint counts obtained in the hdf suggests that we are now close to convergence ( williams _ et al .",
    "thus the lower limit to the cob obtained by summing up the contributions of faint galaxies is likely close to the real value . at longer wavelengths , the dirbe instrument on _ cobe _ has given upper limits on the fir background between 2 and 300 @xmath0 m ( hauser 1995 ) , while puget _",
    "( 1996 ) have discovered an isotropic component in the _",
    "cobe_/firas residuals between 200 @xmath0 m and 2 mm , which could be the long  sought `` cosmic infrared background '' ( hereafter cib ) .",
    "the presence of this component is confirmed by a new analysis restricted to the cleanest regions of the sky , where the foreground galactic components are negligible ( guiderdoni _ et al .",
    "such a detection seems to yield the first `` post_iras _ '' constraint on the high@xmath1 evolution of galaxies in the ir / submm range , before the era of _ iso _ results .",
    "its level comparable to the above  mentionned estimate of the cob suggests that a significant fraction of the energy of young stars is absorbed by dust and released in the ir / submm .",
    "the models which have been proposed to predict the faint counts and background radiation in the ir / submm can be classified as `` backward evolution '' and `` forward evolution '' , following the good review by lonsdale ( 1996 ) . in the first class of models , the ir / submm luminosity function undergoes luminosity and/or number evolution which are simply parameterized as power laws of @xmath12 ( e.g. weedman 1990 ; beichman and helou 1991 ; hacking and soifer 1991 ; oliver _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; treyer and silk 1993 ; blain and longair 1993 ; pearson and rowan ",
    "robinson 1996 ) .",
    "these power laws are generally derived from fits of _ iras _ galaxy counts ( which do not probe deeper than @xmath13 ) .",
    "then they are extrapolated up to redshifts of a few units .",
    "unfortunately , various analyses of _ iras _ deep counts yield discrepant results at @xmath14 mjy , and the issue of the evolution is very controverted ( see e.g. bertin _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , for a new analysis and discussion ) .    in the second class of models , the photometric evolution in the ir / submm",
    "is computed by implementing some of the involved physical processes .",
    "for instance : chemical evolution which rules the amount of dust responsible for the ir / submm emission is modelled in wang ( 1991a , b ) , and eales and edmunds ( 1996a , b ) .",
    "in addition to chemical evolution , the photometric evolution of stellar populations which heat the dust is modelled by franceschini _",
    "( 1991 , 1994 ) and fall , charlot and pei ( 1996 ) . while the previous models assume a simple relation between the dust content and the heavy  element abundance of the gas , dwek and varosi ( 1996 ) try to explicitly model the processes of dust formation and destruction . however , both classes of models assume that all galaxies form at the same redshift @xmath15 and that there is no number evolution .",
    "but the paradigm of the hierarchical growth of structures implies that there is no clear  cut redshift @xmath15 since galaxy formation is a continuous process . only blain and longair ( 1993a , b ) proposed a formalism to compute the redshift range of galaxy formation ,",
    "in addition to chemical evolution ,    a consistent approach to the early evolution of galaxies is particularly important for any attempt at predicting their submm properties . fig .",
    "1 shows _ model _",
    "spectra of a luminous ir galaxy as it would be observed if placed at different redshifts .",
    "there is a wavelength range , between @xmath16 @xmath0 m and @xmath17 mm , in which the distance effect is counterbalanced by the `` negative k ",
    "correction '' due to the huge rest ",
    "frame emission maximum at @xmath18 @xmath0 m . in this range ,",
    "the apparent flux of galaxies depends weakly on redshift to the point that , evolution aside , a galaxy might be easier to detect at @xmath19 than at @xmath20 ! the observer ",
    "frame submm fluxes , faint galaxy counts and diffuse background of unresolved galaxies are consequently very sensitive to the early stages of galaxy evolution . note that this particular wavelength range brackets the maximum of emission of the cmb .    the dissipative and non  dissipative processes ruling galaxy formation in dark matter haloes have been studied by various authors ( see especially white and rees 1978 ; schaeffer and silk 1985 ; evrard 1989 ; cole 1991 ; blanchard _ et al .",
    "the modelling of these processes , complemented by star formation , stellar evolution and stellar feedback to the interstellar medium , has been achieved at various levels of complexity , in the so  called _ semi  analytic _ approach which has been successfully applied to the prediction of the statistical properties of galaxies ( white and frenk 1991 ; lacey and silk 1991 ; lacey _ et al .",

    "it turns out that , in spite of differences in the details of the models , these studies lead to conclusions in the uv , visible and ( stellar ) nir which are remarkably similar .",
    "none of these models has been applied so far to the prediction of the properties of galaxies in the ir and submm ranges .",
    "this is the main aim of this paper which proposes a simple version of the semi  analytic approach and gives predictions of faint counts at wavelengths between 60 @xmath0 m and 1.4 mm .",
    "this first study also intends to identify some of the difficulties arising in such a modelling .",
    "2 quickly reviews the main physical processes which have to be introduced in order to describe the formation of galaxies : the non  dissipative collapse of perturbations , the dissipative collapse of the gas , star formation and evolution , and feedback .",

    "4 extracts useful information from the recent uv / visible deep surveys and uses the new constraint arising from the cib in order to generate a family of evolutionary scenarios . sec . 5",
    "gives the ir / submm counts predicted from these scenarios .",

    "briefly discusses these results , as well as the shortcomings of such models , and concludes .    in a previous study",
    ", we showed that the cib can be disentangled with a family of evolutionary scenarios which predict steep submm counts , and that the observations with _",

    "_ 1997 ) . here",
    "we present the details of the modelling and apply it to other observations , more specifically in scuba bands ( through the narrow submm atmospheric windows ) .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was presented in guiderdoni _",
    "( 1996 ) . a forthcoming paper ( hivon _ et al . _ 1997 ) will show simulations of the anisotropies of the diffuse submm background due to galaxies and will study the possibility of their detection , with current and forthcoming instruments . other papers in this series will try to overcome some of the shortcomings of this first study .",
    "the formation and evolution of a galaxy in its dark matter halo can be briefly sketched as follows : the initial perturbation , which is gravitationally dominated by non  baryonic dark matter , grows and collapses . after the ( non - dissipative ) collapse , and subsequent violent relaxation , the halo virializes , through the formation of a mean potential well seen by all particles , which consequently share the same velocity distribution .",
    "as detailed in the appendix , we use the classical top  hat model for spherically ",
    "symmetric perturbations , and we compute the mass distribution of collapsed haloes from the peaks formalism ( bardeen _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) , as in lacey and silk ( 1991 ) and lacey _ et al . _",
    "hereafter , we shall consider the scdm model with @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 as an illustrative case .",
    "we take a baryonic fraction @xmath26 , consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis . the redshift evolution of the number density and formation rate of collapsed haloes is plotted in fig .",
    "the baryonic gas cools in the potential wells of dark matter haloes , by a process identical to cooling flows observed at the centre of rich clusters .",
    "the cooling time at halo radius @xmath27 is @xmath28 with @xmath29 for ionized primordial gas .",
    "the cooling curve @xmath30 takes into account various cooling processes .",
    "we do not consider the metallicity dependence of @xmath30 . neglecting this dependence leads to an _ overestimate _ of cooling times , which are already very short .",
    "the equation @xmath31 defines a cooling radius @xmath32 as a function of redshift @xmath1 . at this redshift , only gas inside @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 if @xmath34 ) cools and is available for star formation .",
    "this cooling criterion introduces a high  mass cut - off in the mass distribution of cold baryonic cores . at the low  mass end ,",
    "the cooling is so efficient that almost all the gas can cool , leading to a slope of the mass distribution of baryonic cores @xmath35 at redshift @xmath7 , which is close to the slope @xmath36 for the number density of collapsed haloes .",
    "this is the so  called `` overcooling '' problem ( cole 1991 ; blanchard _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) .",
    "the final radius of the cold gas in rotational equilibrium is related to the initial radius by conservation of angular momentum ( fall and efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "approximately , @xmath37 , with the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath38 ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; efstathiou _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ; zurek _ et al .",
    "previous studies only used the mean value of @xmath39 in this formula .",
    "hereafter , we introduce the @xmath39 distribution from barnes and efstathiou ( 1987 ) model c04 ( their fig .",
    "according to a fit based on fig . 3 of fall and efstathiou ( 1980 ) , the exponential disk which forms from the dissipative collapse of the gas has a length scale @xmath40 and a radius including half the cold baryonic mass @xmath41 .",
    "a dynamical time scale in the disk  like core is @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to note that only disks can form in this formalism .",
    "the formation of elliptical galaxies ( and of bulges of spiral galaxies ) has to be explained by the merging of disks .",
    "( 1993 ) and cole _",
    "( 1994 ) showed that this merging process can easily explain the current fraction of ge among bright galaxies .",
    "locally , the sfr depends on numerous physical parameters .",
    "nevertheless , phenomenological studies seem to show that , on galaxy scales , the sfr per unit surface density is proportional to the total gas surface density ( neutral plus molecular ) divided by the dynamical time scale of the disk ( kennicutt 1989 , 1997 ) .",
    "so we shall hereafter assume that the star formation time scale @xmath43 is proportional to the dynamical time scale of the disk @xmath44 and we introduce a first efficiency factor @xmath45 .",
    "with @xmath46 , we take : @xmath47 fig .",
    "3 shows the predicted @xmath43 histogram compared to the histogram of `` roberts times '' for a sample of 63 bright disk galaxies observed by kennicutt _",
    "( 1994 ) . the roberts time is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gas mass in the @xmath50 phase measured from the 21 cm line , @xmath51 is the gas mass in the @xmath52 phase measured from the co line , and @xmath53 is the total star formation rate measured from the h@xmath5 line , under an assumption about the shape of the initial mass function ( hereafter this is salpeter imf ) .",
    "the interesting result is that the model correctly predicts the _ shape _ and _ width _ of the histogram .",
    "we emphasize that this agreement is due to both the range of halo densities ( scaling as @xmath54 ) _ and _ dimensionless spin parameters @xmath39 . without the @xmath39 scatter , the predicted distribution would be about three times too narrow",
    ". the average value of the observed histogram can be reproduced by taking @xmath55 for our scdm model .",
    "finally , for sake of simplicity , we use a salpeter imf with index @xmath56 .",
    "stars have masses @xmath57 .",
    "we also assume that the mass fraction blocked in dark objects with masses below 0.1 @xmath58 is negligible .",
    "the explosion of massive stars can expel gas from the galaxies and quench star formation , leading to a strong increase of the mass  to  luminosity ratios in small objects .",
    "observationally , hi holes and x  ray superbubbles are good evidence that such galactic winds are present in galaxies . the stellar feedback is introduced in a similar way by most authors , following the original work by dekel and silk ( 1986 ) . by equating the gas binding energy to the thermal energy ejected by supernovae ,",
    "one gets : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of sne per unit mass of stars , depending on the imf . for our choice of imf , @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "the output mechanical energy of a sn is @xmath63 erg .",
    "the escape velocity at radius @xmath64 in a singular isothermal sphere truncated at radius @xmath33 is @xmath65 .",
    "the maximum of the @xmath39 distribution corresponds to @xmath66 , leading to @xmath67 .",
    "since much of this energy is subsequently radiated away , we insert a second efficiency factor @xmath68 .",
    "after some algebra , the mass fraction of stars @xmath69 forming before the triggering of the galactic wind at time @xmath70 is given by : @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 km s@xmath22 for the salpeter imf . nevertheless , there is much uncertainty on these parameters because of the cooling of supernova remnants before wind triggering .",
    "for instance , numerical simulations seem to suggest that @xmath74 ( thornton _ et al . _ 1997 ) . cole _",
    "( 1994 ) introduced a fit based on sph simulations of galaxy formation in which most of the feedback effect is due to momentum exchange rather than to ism heating ( navarro and white 1993 ) . for a typical feedback parameter @xmath75 , the numerical simulations can be fitted with @xmath76 and @xmath77 km s@xmath22 .",
    "we shall hereafter take these values as our standard parameters .",
    "the situation is still complicated by the existence of _ non  local _ feedback processes in addition to the local ones .",
    "efstathiou ( 1992 ) and blanchard _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) suggest that high@xmath1 re  ionization of the igm could prevent cooling in haloes with circular velocities below @xmath78 to 50 km s@xmath22 , and possibly as high as @xmath79 in case of adiabatic collapse .",
    "so it is very likely that the overall quenching of dwarf formation depends on redshift . introducing this redshift dependence of dwarf formation",
    "partly alleviates the problem of the steep slope of the luminosity function ( see e.g. kauffmann _ et al .",
    "so the situation appears to be very complicated , in the absence of a global theory of feedback processes . in the following ,",
    "we shall simply model the combination of local and non  local feedbacks by introducing a simple @xmath80 dependence for @xmath81 .      a model of spectrophotometric evolution",
    "is used to compute the age dependence of the gas content , the uv to nir spectra of the stellar populations , and the mass  to  luminosity ratios .",
    "the stars are placed on the zero  age main sequence of the hr diagram according to the imf .",
    "the models use compilations of stellar evolutionary tracks taking into account the various stages of stellar evolution in order to compute at each time step the distribution of stellar populations in the hr diagram .",
    "this distribution is combined with a library of stellar spectra and gives the synthetic spectrum @xmath82 . at the end of their lifetimes , stars die and return a fraction of their mass to the ism . the model which is used here",
    "is described in guiderdoni and rocca  volmerange ( 1987 , 1988 ) , and rocca  volmerange and guiderdoni ( 1988 ) , and includes upgraded stellar tracks from schaller _ et al . _",

    "an average optical depth of the disks is implemented and scales as the relative gas content and gas metallicity ( estimated through the assumption of instant recycling approximation ) ; no evolution of the dust composition is considered ; the variation of the extinction curve with metallicity is based on an interpolation of the milky way and the magellanic clouds which gives an extinction proportional to @xmath104 ; 2 .   a simple `` slab '' geometry is assumed where dust and stars are mixed with equal height scales ; 3 .   finally , the dust emission spectrum scales with the bolometric ir luminosity , following the observational relationship of _ iras _ colours with luminosities .",
    "such a dependence is obtained by changing the abundance of three components : pah , very small grains and big grains ( and the temperature of the big grains ) .",
    "-1truecm    we introduced two modes of star formation . in the `` quiescent '' mode  ,",
    "the distribution of the characteristic time scales @xmath43 for star formation peaks at 3 gyr , and ranges from 0.3 to 30 gyr . in the `` burst mode '' , the distribution of @xmath43 peaks at 0.30 gyr , and ranges from 0.03 to 3 gyr .",
    "the `` quiescent '' mode is unable to reproduce the rapid evolution of the cosmic sfr and gas densities . the steep decline of the sfr and gas content since @xmath6 can be accommodated by assuming an increasing fraction of mass involved in the `` burst '' mode .",
    "since one knows that the fraction of peculiar objects with signs of interaction / merging increases with the depth of the survey , we suspect that the bursting behaviour of the cfrs and hdf galaxies is due to interactions and we introduce a phenomenological @xmath1 dependence fitting the evolution of the pair rates . since ligs and uligs are respectively interacting and merging systems , it is reasonable to estimate that , reciprocally , cfrs and hdf galaxies with peculiar morphologies should emit in the ir . for these `` mild starbursts '' and `` luminous ir / uv galaxies '' , we assume a conservative range of ir  to  blue luminosity ratios @xmath105 computed from our standard assumptions on average optical thickness and geometry .",
    "finally , in order to reproduce the bright end of ir galaxies with @xmath106 , we also introduced a population of heavily  extinguished galaxies with massive star formation , similar to uligs .    with these ingredients , we designed a family of evolutionary scenarios which fit the local overall energy budget and its evolution to @xmath3 .",
    "these scenarios also fit the cob estimate computed from faint galaxy counts , and are consistent with the observational range for the cib .",
    "so we feel confident that we roughly reproduce the local energy budget as well as a plausible range for the integrated budget along the line of sight .",
    "the scenarios predict uv and ir emissions strongly differring at high @xmath1 . with the same sfr history ,",
    "different uv fluxes can be obtained with different extinctions and imf . in some of the scenarios , the uv fluxes at @xmath107",
    "fit the current measurements ( or lower values ) of madau _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , but with ten times more sfr than deduced _ under the assumption of no extinction_. such a factor 10 , which includes the contribution of heavily  extinguished uligs , is much larger than the factor 3 corresponding to the correction for extinction derived by pettini _",
    "( 1997 ) for the hdf galaxies with lyman ",
    "continuum drop  outs .",
    "this quantifies the strong warning that the deduction of the sfr density from uv fluxes misses the optically  dark side of galaxy formation .",
    "this family of scenarios was obtained within the context of the same cosmological model , with similar prescriptions for dissipative and non  dissipative collapses , star formation and feedback .",
    "the changes only affect the efficiency of star formation in a dynamical time scale ( the @xmath45 parameter ) , the imf ( salpeter or only massive stars ) , and the extinction ( average extinction with `` slab '' geometry , or strong , `` screen''like extinction ) .",
    "we saw the extreme sensitivity of the predictions to the parameter choice for this poorly constrained astrophysics .",
    "the scenarios are consistent with _ iras _ data .",
    "they give similar predictions for the _ iras _",
    "60 @xmath0 m luminosity function and faint counts , provided the local fraction of uligs is lower than a few % .",
    "they are in rough agreement with the redshift surveys of _ iras _ samples , in spite of some uncertainty in the data . by construction ,",
    "the ir spectra also fit the correlation of ir colours with total ir luminosity in the bright galaxy sample .",
    "the selected scenarios are consistent with the @xmath108 range for the observed cib and they are used to `` disentangle '' the background into faint galaxy counts .",
    "this cib is the first `` post_iras _ '' observation which helps constraining the high@xmath1 evolution of galaxies in the ir / submm and the energy budget integrated along the line  of  sight , before _",
    "iso _ results .",
    "in contrast with the counts at fir wavelengths which are rather degenerate , the submm counts are very sensitive to the details of the evolutionary scenarios . thus our study illustrates the importance of the submm range to constrain the evolution of the energy budget of galaxies . as emphasized by guiderdoni _",
    "( 1997 ) , our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies is so far entirely based on surveys in the uv / visible window .",
    "we are missing the part of star / galaxy formation hidden by dust .",
    "we need to open a second window in the ir / submm , which is being explored by _ iso _ and scuba , and will be extensively studied by forthcoming telescopes and satellites such as _ sirtf _ , sofia , _ first _ and _",
    "planck_.    there are clearly many approximations and shortcomings in our approach , which could be listed as a research programme for forthcoming papers .",
    "( i ) we need to implement the astrophysical processes in a code which explicitly follows the merging history trees of haloes and galaxies .",
    "this code would have to include the various aspects of interaction between galaxies , and to explain why the interaction rate strongly declined since @xmath109 .",
    "it would also have to include the effect of interactions on the sfr .",
    "( ii ) the modelling of the ir emission could take into account the evolution of dust properties with chemical abundances , as well as more sophisticated transfer .",
    "( iii ) the global energy budget of galaxies has to be addressed by fitting the faint galaxy counts in the uv / visible and @xmath110 , as well as the forthcoming nir counts from _ iso _ , in particular at 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "first results are already given here , and suggest an amount of evolution which is consistent with our predictions .",
    "( iv ) the strong evolution of the comoving sfr density has consequences on the gas and heavy element abundances .",
    "the heavy elements made by the high sfrs are to be found in the stars , the cold gas , or the hot gas of the intergalactic medium . if the sfr turned out to be much higher than determined , for instance , by madau _",
    "( 1996 ) , a significant fraction of the heavy elements should be present in the igm .",
    "the amount of elements synthetised in bursts would still be higher if the imf is top  heavy , as in the simple model of uligs which is used here . according to mushotzky and loewenstein ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the absence of evolution of the iron content of clusters at @xmath111 is a first evidence that the global metal production is 25 times higher than inferred from the uv drop  out technique .",
    "despite the limitations listed above , this paper provides the first predictions of the ir luminosity function , ir / submm galaxy counts , redshift distributions , and diffuse background , obtained from a semi  analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution which takes into account the main physical processes from the collapse of the density fluctuations to the absorption of uv and visible star light by dust and the re  emission in the ir / submm range .",
    "the predictions of this new model are consistent with the dynamical process of continuous galaxy formation predicted by the hierarchical growth of structures in a scdm universe , and represent a significant progress with respect to previous phenomenological models designed to make predictions in the ir / submm .",
    "tables giving the faint counts and redshift distributions at various wavelengths between 15 @xmath0 m and 2 mm are available by anonymous ftp at * ftp.iap.fr * in the directory /pub / from_users / guider / fir , and on the web node of the institut dastrophysique de paris at * http://www.iap.fr / users / guider / fir.html*.     * acknowledgements .",

    "this model could be fitted to the description of `` active '' objects such as luminous galaxies seen in the ir .",
    "such a simplifying assumption is very similar to that of haehnelt and rees ( 1993 ) who modelled qso formation in each generation of halo formation .",
    "the issue of merging should be explicitly addressed by making monte ",
    "carlo realizations of the halo merging history tree and monitoring the merging of galaxies in merged haloes , for instance with the dynamical friction time scale ( kauffmann _ et al _ 1993 ; cole _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; and following works ) .",
    "such studies show that the galaxy merging rate is relatively low , and that the resulting mass and luminosity functions do not differ significantly from those computed with cruder assumptions .",
    "more precisely , galaxy merging seems to be sufficient to make the 10 % fraction of giant galaxies which are elliptical , but does not produce a significant change in the slope of the luminosity function at faint magnitudes .",
    "the implementation of the astrophysics hereafter described into this type of code is clearly one of the next steps of our programme .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthwhile to note that only merging following the slow process of dynamical friction has been currently modelled .",
