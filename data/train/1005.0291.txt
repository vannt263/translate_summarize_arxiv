    "in modern cellular systems , interference is one of the main factors which limit the communication capacity . in order to further enhance performance , methods to better control interference",
    "have recently been investigated intensively .",
    "one of the principal techniques to achieve this is cooperation among neighboring base stations .",
    "this will be part of the forthcoming lte - advanced cellular standard .",
    "it is seen as a means of achieving the desired spectral efficiency of mobile networks .",
    "in addition , it may enhance the performance of cell - edge users , a very important performance metric of future wireless cellular systems .",
    "finally , fairness issues are expected to be resolved more easily with base station cooperation .    in standardization oriented literature",
    ", the assumptions generally are very strict .",
    "the cooperation backbones , i.e.  the wires linking the base stations , are assumed to have infinite capacity .",
    "full channel state information ( csi ) is assumed to be present at all cooperating base stations .",
    "then , multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) optimization techniques can be used for designing the system @xcite . however , while providing a useful theoretical benchmark , the results thus obtained are not accepted by the operators as reliably predicting the performance of actual networks .    in order to obtain a more realistic assessment of the performance of cellular networks with base station cooperation ,",
    "the above assumptions need to be adapted to reality .",
    "first , it is well - known that one can not really assume perfect csi in mobile communication networks .",
    "second , glass fibers or any medium used for the backbones never have infinite capacity .",
    "the assumption of finite cooperation capacity will also lead to a better understanding of the amount of cooperation necessary to achieve a certain performance .",
    "vice versa , we would like to know which capacity can be achieved with the backhaul found in heterogeneous networks using microwave , optical fibers and other media .",
    "such insights would get lost when assuming infinite cooperation capacity .",
    "the question arises how much cooperation is needed in order to achieve the same performance as would be achievable with infinite cooperation capacity . for general interference networks with multiple receivers ,",
    "the analysis is very difficult .",
    "thus it is natural to start by taking a closer look at component networks which together form a complete interference network .",
    "such components are those subnetworks formed by the complete set of base stations , but with only one receiving mobile . then there is no more interference ,",
    "so one can concentrate on finding out by how much the capacity increases by limited base station cooperation .",
    "this result can be seen as a first step towards a complete rigorous analysis of general interference networks .",
    "a situation which is closely related can be phrased in the cooperation setting as well .",
    "usually , there is only one data stream intended for one receiver .",
    "assume that a central node splits this data stream into two components .",
    "each of these components is then forwarded to one of two base stations . using the cooperation setting",
    ", one can address the question how much overhead needs to be transmitted by the splitter with the data component , i.e. how much information about the data component and the csi intended for one base station needs to be known at the other base station in order to achieve a high , possibly maximal data rate .    in @xcite , the cooperation of base stations in an uplink network",
    "is analyzed .",
    "a turbo - like decoding scheme is proposed .",
    "different degrees of cooperation and different cooperation topologies are compared in numerical simulations . in @xcite ,",
    "work has also been done on the practical level to analyze cooperative schemes .",
    "the implementation of a real - time distributed cooperative system for the downlink of the fourth - generation standard lte - advanced was presented . in that system ,",
    "the channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitters was imperfect , the limited - capacity glass fibers between the transmitting base stations were used to exchange csi and data information .",
    "a feeder distributed the data among the transmitting base stations .",
    "a question which is not addressed in this work but which will be considered in the future is what rates can be achieved if there are two networks as described above which belong to different providers and which hence do not jointly optimize their coding , to say nothing of active cooperation . in that case , uncontrolled interference heavily disturbs each network , and challenges different from those considered here need to be faced by the system designer .",
    "the rigorous analysis of such cellular wireless systems as described above using information - theoretic methods should provide useful insights .",
    "the ultimate performance limits as well as the optimal cooperation protocols can be derived from such an analysis .",
    "the first information - theoretic approach to schemes with cooperating encoders goes back to willems @xcite long before this issue was relevant for practical networks .",
    "for that reason , it was not considered much in the next two decades .",
    "willems considers a protocol where before transmission , the encoders of a discrete memoryless multiple access channel ( mac ) may exchange information about their messages via noiseless finite - capacity links ( one in each direction ) .",
    "this may be done in a causal and iterative fashion , so the protocol is called a conferencing protocol .    for the reasons mentioned at the beginning ,",
    "willems conferencing protocol has attracted interest in recent years .",
    "gaussian macs using willems conferencing between the encoders were analyzed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , in these two works , it was shown that interference which is known non - causally at the encoders does not reduce capacity . for a compound mac , both discrete and gaussian , with two possible channel realizations and full csi at the receiver , the capacity region was found in @xcite . in the same paper , the capacity region",
    "was found for the interference channel if only one transmitter can send information to the other ( unidirectional cooperation ) and if the channel is in the strong interference regime .",
    "another variant of unidirectional cooperation was investigated in @xcite , where the three encoders of a gaussian mac can cooperate over a ring of unidirectional links .",
    "however , only lower and upper bounds were found for the maximum achievable equal rate .",
    "further literature exists for willems conferencing on the decoding side of a multi - user network . for degraded discrete broadcast channels ,",
    "the capacity region was found in @xcite if the receivers can exchange information about the received codewords in a single conference step .",
    "for the general broadcast and multicast channels , achievability regions were determined . for the gaussian relay channel ,",
    "the dependence of the performance on the number of conferencing iterations between the receiver and the relay was investigated in @xcite . for the gaussian @xmath0-interference channel , outer and inner bounds to the capacity region where the decoders can exchange information about the channel outputs are provided in @xcite . finally , for discrete and gaussian memoryless interference channels with conferencing decoders and where the senders have a common message",
    ", @xcite determines achievable regions .",
    "exact capacity regions are determined if the channel is physically degraded .",
    "if the encoders can conference instead of having a common message , the situation is the same .",
    "the discrete mac with conferencing encoders is closely related to the discrete mac with common message .",
    "intuitively , the messages exchanged between the encoders in the cooperative setting form a common message , so the results known for the corresponding non - cooperative channel with common message can be applied to find the achievable rates of the cooperative setting .",
    "this transition was used in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the capacity region of the mac with common message was determined in @xcite , a simpler proof was found in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize the original setting considered by willems even further .",
    "we treat a compound discrete memoryless mac with an arbitrary number of channel realizations",
    ". the receiver s csi ( csir ) may be arbitrary between full and absent .",
    "the possible transmitter s csi ( csit ) may be different from csir and asymmetric at the two encoders .",
    "it is restricted to a finite number of instances , even though the number of actual channel realizations may be infinite . for this channel ,",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "first , we characterize the capacity region of this channel where the transmitters have a common message .",
    "then , we determine the capacity region of the channel where there is no common message any more .",
    "instead , the encoders have access to the output of a rate - constrained noiseless two - user mac .",
    "each input node of the noiseless mac corresponds to one of the transmitters of the compound mac .",
    "each input to the noiseless mac consists of the pair formed by the message which is to be transmitted and the csit present at the corresponding transmitter .",
    "this generalizes willems conferencing to a non - causal conferencing protocol , where the conferencing capacities considered by willems correspond to the rate constraints of the noiseless mac in the generalized model .",
    "it turns out that this non - causal conferencing does not increase the capacity region , and as in @xcite , every rate contained in the capacity region can be achieved using a one - shot willems `` conference '' .",
    "we determine how large the conferencing capacities need to be in order to achieve the full - cooperation sum rate and the full - cooperation capacity region , respectively .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting because it shows that forming a `` virtual mimo system '' as mentioned in subsection [ subsect : motiv ] and considered in @xcite does not require infinite cooperation capacity .      in section [",
    "sect : model ] , we address the problems presented above .",
    "we present the two basic channel models underlying our analysis : the compound mac with common message and partial csi and the compound mac with conferencing encoders and partial csi .",
    "we also introduce the generalized conferencing protocol used in the analysis of the conferencing mac .",
    "we state the main results concerning the capacity regions of the two models .",
    "we also derive the minimal amount of cooperation needed in the conferencing setting in order to achieve the optimal ( i.e. full - cooperation ) sum rate and the optimal , full - cooperation rate region .",
    "the achievability of the rate regions claimed in the main theorems is shown in section [ sect : ach ] .",
    "the weak converses are shown in section [ sect : conv ] .",
    "only the converse for the conferencing mac is presented in detail , because the converse for the mac with common message is similar to part of the converse for the mac with conferencing encoders .",
    "we address the application of the mac with conferencing encoders to the analysis of cellular systems where one data stream is split up and sent using different base stations in section [ sect : numerik ] . in the same section , in a simple numerical example ,",
    "the capacity regions of a mac with conferencing encoders is plotted for various amounts of cooperation . in the final section ,",
    "we sum up the paper and discuss the directions of future research . in the appendix several auxiliary lemmata concerning typical sequences",
    "are collected .      for real numbers",

    "the compound discrete memoryless mac @xmath43 together with the csit partitions @xmath67 and the csir partition @xmath68 is denoted by the quadruple @xmath69 .",
    "there are several communication situations which are appropriately described by a compound mac .",
    "one case is where information is to be sent from two transmitting terminals to one receiving terminal through a fading channel .",
    "if the channel remains constant during one transmission block , one obtains a compound channel . usually , csit is not perfect .",
    "it might be , however , that the transmitters have access to partial csi , e.g. by using feedback .",
    "this will not determine an exact channel state , but only an approximation .",
    "coding must then be done in such a way that it is good for all those channel realizations which are possible according to csit .",
    "another situation to be modeled by compound channels occurs if there are two transmitters each of which would like to send one message to several receivers at the same time .",
    "the channels to the different receivers differ from each other because all the terminals are at different locations .",
    "now , the following meaning can be given to the above variants of channel knowledge .",
    "if csit is given as @xmath70 , this describes that the information is not intended for all receivers , but only for those contained in @xmath71 .",
    "knowledge about the intended receivers may be asymmetric at the senders .",
    "if every receiver has its own decoding procedure , full csir ( i.e. @xmath66 ) would be a natural assumption . if the receivers must all use the same decoder ,",
    "there is no csir .",
    "non - trivial csir could mean that independently of the decision at the transmitters where data are to be sent ( modeled by csit ) , a subset of receivers is chosen as the set which the data are intended for without informing the transmitters about this decision .",

    "a moment s thought reveals that this is a stronger statement than just saying that the rates outside of the capacity region are not achievable.[remcm0 ] 2 .",
    "@xmath107 is independent of the csir partition @xmath68 .",

    "a heuristic explanation of this phenomenon is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.5 ) for the case of single - user compound channels .",
    "it builds on the fact that the receiver can estimate the channel from a pilot sequence with a length which is negligible compared to the blocklength.[remcm1 ] 3 .",

    "the rate constraints are part of the problem setting and thus fixed , but the noiseless mac is not given , it is part of the code . for reasons that will become clear soon , we call it a `` conferencing mac '' . in the second stage ,",
    "the information gathered by the switch is passed on to each encoder over channels without incurring noise or loss .",
    "the codewords are chosen in the third stage .",
    "each encoder chooses its codewords using three parameters : the message it wants to transmit , its csit , and the output of the conferencing mac .",

    "consequently , there is a limited degree of cooperation between the encoders enhancing the reliability of transmission .",

    "the sum of the overhead rates required to achieve the full - cooperation sum capacity can be seen from corollary [ sumcapcor ] .",

    "we present a simple example of a rate region for the mac with conferencing encoders .",

    "we have derived the capacity regions of two information - theoretic compound multiple access channels : the compound multiple - access channel with common message and the compound multiple - access channel with conferencing encoders , where conferencing can be done about messages and channel state information .",
    "the channel with common message , aside from the interest it has on its own , was used to derive the capacity region of the channel with conferencing encoders .",
    "the latter channel can be applied in the rigorous information - theoretic analysis of certain wireless cellular networks which use base station cooperation in order to transmit data to one mobile receiver .",
    "one can derive the exact amount of base station cooperation that is needed in order to achieve the sum capacity and the capacity region as would be achievable if the base stations were at the same location and could thus be regarded as forming a `` virtual miso system '' .",
    "this analysis was motivated by recent developments in the design of cellular systems .",
    "as interference is the main limiting factor in the performance of such systems , research has recently focused on methods of controlling interference in order to meet the requirements for future wireless systems such as lte - advanced .",
    "much of the literature which has contributed to this research uses strict assumptions that will not generally be met in reality .",
    "assuming limited base station cooperation and channel uncertainty in this paper , we tried to obtain a more appropriate description of real situations .",
    "note that we did not address the issue of unknown out - of - network interference .",
    "this is a problem for real networks .",
    "different systems operating in the same frequency band and operated by different providers who do not jointly design their systems interfere each other .",
    "this happens , e.g. , when wireless local area network ( wlan)-systems are located close to each other .",
    "future work will be to model this information - theoretically .",
    "the appropriate model is to take multiple - access channels with conferencing encoders .",
    "however in this case , channel uncertainty should not be included by considering a compound channel , but rather , the model best describing reality is the arbitrarily varying channel . in such a channel , the transmission probabilities can change for each channel use in a way unknown to the encoder .",
    "( this is just the way unknown interference acts on channels . )",
    "ahlswede s robustification technique @xcite shows how to construct codes for arbitrarily varying channels from codes for compound channels .",
    "hence from that point of view , the work done in the present paper can also be regarded as a preliminary needed for the analysis of arbitrarily varying multiple - access channels with conferencing encoders .",
