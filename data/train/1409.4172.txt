    "one of the most important parameters in stellar astrophysics is the mass of stars . eclipsing binaries with well - defined multi - passband light curves and accurate radial velocities for both components",
    "provide us with definitive empirical masses , radii , effective temperatures and luminosities . in order to better understand the physics of binary systems and test the predictions of theoretical models",
    ", it is thus important to quantitatively analyse the properties of massive binary systems with well - constrained orbital parameters . in this",
    "context studies of the rare early b - type massive stars has major highlights .",
    "the relatively bright eclipsing binary gtcep ( hd217224 , hip113385 , v=8.13 , b - v=0.34 ) was discovered to be an eclipsing binary system by @xcite , who derived an orbital period of 4.908756d using the 12 times of minima obtained from photographic observations .",
    "they obtained the first photographic light curve of the system and classified it as an algol - type binary .",
    "a first spectroscopic study was carried out by @xcite who obtained the spectroscopic orbit and classified the primary component as a b3 star . later on the photographic study made by @xcite who revised the orbital period and obtained a light curve containing rather a deep primary minimum and a shallow secondary minimum .",
    "obtained ubv light curves and analyzed using the wood s method .",
    "photometric observations of gtcep were also obtained by the hipparcos satellite ( gtcep being identified as hip113385 @xcite ) and later in the context of the northern sky variability survey @xcite . although gtcep has been studied on many occasions its astrophysical parameters were not firmly established . on",
    "the other hand @xcite divided the semi - detached algol - type binaries ( sdabs ) into two groups .",
    "the orbital angular momenta of sdabs with periods p@xmath8 days and p@xmath95 days are 45 and 25 per cent smaller than those detached binaries with similar mass .",
    "the specific angular momenta of systems with p@xmath95 d are larger than than those of p@xmath8 d for the gainers of the same mass .",
    "the spins of the mass gaining stars point out a sharp distinction between short and long period orbit systems at an orbital period of 5 days .",
    "the orbital period of gtcep is very close to this discriminating period .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "i present new spectroscopic observations and radial velocities of both components of the eclipsing pair . by analysing the previously published light curves and the new radial velocities i obtain orbital parameters for the components . combining the results of these analyses we obtain absolute physical parameters of both components .",
    "in addition , i conclude with a brief discussion of the system s evolutionary status .",
    "the present study is the result of a collaboration in which two data sets were obtained at two different in the roughly same latitude observatories , using the two telescopes and spectrographs .",
    "the first dataset was obtained with the reosc echelle spectrograph mounted on the 182 cm telescope at the asiago observatory in italy , with exposure time ranging from 30 to 45 minutes .",
    "the instrument covers the spectral domain between 3900 and 7300  , divided into 27 orders . the average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and resolving power @xmath10 were about 120 and @xmath11 50000 , respectively .",
    "four _ chelle _ spectra of gtcep were taken from march 17 , 2009 to july 8 , 2011 .",
    "12 _ chelle _ spectra of gtcep were collected with the turkish faint object spectrograph camera ( tfosc ) attached to the 1.5 m telescope between august 22 , 2011 and august 2 , 2013 , under good seeing conditions .",
    "further details on the telescope and the spectrograph can be found at http://www.tug.tubitak.gov.tr .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum was 4000 - 9000   in 12 orders , with a resolving power of @xmath12/@xmath13 @xmath117000 at 6563   and an average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was @xmath11120 .",
    "i also obtained high s / n spectra of the early type standard stars 1cas ( b0.5iv ) , hr153 ( b2iv ) , @xmath14 her ( b5iv ) , 21peg ( b9.5v ) and @xmath15lyr ( a0v ) for use as templates in derivation of the radial velocities .",
    "i applied the same reduction procedure to both datasets .",
    "the electronic bias was removed from each image and i used the crreject option for cosmic ray removal .",
    "thus , the resulting spectra were largely cleaned from the cosmic rays .",
    "the _ chelle _",
    "spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated by using fe - ar lamp source with help of the iraf   observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    "( aura ) , under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation ] echelle package @xcite .",
    "a total of 22 times of mid - primary minimum and one secondary of gtcep were collected from the literature and listed in table1 .",
    "the starting epoch and orbital period are taken from the @xmath16 and @xcite , respectively .",
    "therefore the following ephemeris was used to determine the cycle number and @xmath17(i ) residuals ,    @xmath18    the o - c(i ) residuals , indicating the differences between observed times of mid - eclipses and calculated ones using this ephemeris are listed in the third column of table1 .",
    "these residuals for all the times of mid - eclipses of the gtcep are plotted against the epoch numbers in the top panel of fig.1 .",
    "the trend of the @xmath17(i ) residulas can be described by an upward parabolic curve superimposed on a sine - like variation .",
    "it is obvious that the change of the @xmath17(i ) residuals is a result of at least two separate causes .",
    "because gtcep is a semi - detached algol - type binary , the system could be transferring mass from less massive component to the more massive primary leading to an upward parabolic change of orbital period , i.e. , indicating that the orbital period is continuously increasing .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that cyclic period changes are a common phenomenon in close binary systems .",
    "cyclic variations in the orbital periods are usually explained by magnetic activity in one or both components , by an apsidal motion , and or by the light - travel time effect around common - center with a third - body . since gtcep is composed of a b2 v and a a0 iv star that contain convective core and radiative atmosphere .",
    "this suggests that the cyclic changes in the @xmath17 residuals can not be originated from the magnetic activity cycle mechanism .",
    "we can , therefore , easily ignore the possibility of solar - like activity in both comments .",
    "both the light and radial velocities of the system point out a circular orbit for the system .",
    "in addition , the o - c(i ) residual obtained for the mid - secondary eclipse seem to follow the same trend as the primary minimum .",
    "therefore , we may rule out the apsidal motion as a possible cause of orbital period change",
    ". therefore such a sinusoidal / cyclic change in the orbital period of gtcep can only be explained by an orbital motion around a third - body .",
    "we analyzed the o - c(i ) residuals under an assumption of a combination of mass - transfer and third - body , i.e. the eclipsing pair is orbiting around a third - body .",
    "we may compute the times of light minimum with a formula as    @xmath19    where t@xmath20 is the starting epoch , e is the integer eclipse number and p@xmath20 is the orbital period of the eclipsing pair .",
    "while the third - term represents the parabolic change in the @xmath17 residuals the time delay or advance of any observed eclipse is caused by the influence of a third - body can be represented by a fourth - term . the light - time effect @xmath21 t is depended up on the semi - major axis of the eclipsing pair around the barycenter , inclination , eccentricity and longitude of the periastron of the third - body orbit .",
    "i have used the conventional formulae given by @xcite .",
    "a linear least squares solution was applied to the data and the coefficient of the third - term and the parameters for the third - body orbit were obtained .",
    "the coefficient of the quadratic - term , originated from the mass transfer between the components is calculated as q=1.28x10@xmath22 @xmath10.22x10@xmath22 dayscycle@xmath23 .",
    "a secular period increase has been calculated as dp / dt=1.90x10 @xmath24dyr@xmath23 which corresponds to 1.64 seccentury @xmath23 , indicating that mass transfer from less massive to the more massive star at a rate of dm / dt=4.4x10@xmath25m@xmath2yr@xmath23 .",
    "the parameters of the third - body orbit are listed in table2 .",
    "my calculation suggests that the eclipsing pair revolves around a third - body , in an eccentric orbit with e=0.047 , and with a period of about 57.5@xmath1 2.3 years . the projected radius of the orbit of the eclipsing pair around the center  of  mass is about 13.80@xmath10.52 @xmath5 .",
    "using these values i obtained a mass function as 0.796@xmath10.060 m@xmath2 .",

    "using these luminosities",
    "i have calculated bolometric absolute magnitudes of the components , assuming solar bolometric absolute magnitude of 4.74mag .",

    "this light ratio , the observed colours and the intrinsic colour of the primary star of @xmath32=@xmath260.25@xmath10.01 @xcite allow us to estimate an intrinsic composite colour of @xmath32=@xmath260.27@xmath10.01 .",
    "thus , the interstellar reddening of @xmath33=0.61@xmath10.01mag and absorption in the v - passband of @xmath34=1.89@xmath10.01mag are estimated for the system .",

    "these distance moduli correspond to a distance of 854@xmath143 pc for the primary and 903@xmath152 pc for the secondary star .",

    "we used the models of @xcite , for single stars in the range 0.8@xmath26120m@xmath2 at solar metallicity ( z=0.014 ) , which include rotation to comparison of our measured parameters with evolutionary models . while these evolutionary models are not appropriate for the sdabs , i plot the stars in the well - known hertzsprung - russell diagram to show their locations .    in the short - period , p@xmath8 d , sdabs the mass - gaining components are large enough , relative to the separation , that the infalling mass can directly impact on the accretor . for the first time , @xcite discussed and modelled formation of discs in semi - detached systems . in fig.3 of @xcite , the so - called @xmath39 diagram , the sdabs with and without discs",
    "are plotted . with a fractional radius of 0.24 and a mass - ratio of 0.24",
    ", gtcep locates in the @xmath39 diagram where the gainers of sdabs without permanent or transient disc are gathered . in fig.2 of @xcite",
    "the ratios of the observed equatorial to the computed synchronous rotational velocities for the sdabs were plotted against the mass of the gainers .",
    "the mass - gaining primary star of gtcep is appeared as the highest mass star with synchronous rotational velocities .",
    "@xcite studied evolution of interacting binaries with a b type primary at birth .",
    "they have taken into account both loss of mass and angular momentum during binary evolution .",
    "their calculation clearly showed that the binaries have to lose a significant amount of mass without losing much angular momentum .",
    "their liberal scenario with much mass loss without much loss of angular momentum yielded orbital periods and mass ratios of algols that are in better agreement with the observations .",
    "though physical events related to the liberal scenario at binaries with a b type binary at birth are yet not fully understood they have estimated that only half of the matter lost by the donor is captured by the gainer and the other half left the system .",
    "this assumption reveals that a mass of about 3m@xmath2 is lost for the case of gtcep during its evolution .",
    "since we found the period and projected radius of the orbit the mass of the third star can only be computed for different values of orbital inclination .",
    "the total mass of the eclipsing pair was obtained as 13.28 m@xmath2 . for the inclination of the third - body orbit of @xmath7 , @xmath40 and @xmath6",
    "i calculate masses for the third star as 6.9 , 7.0 and 7.45 m@xmath2 , respectively . for a wide range of orbital inclination",
    "the mass of third star is about 7 solar masses .",
    "if it were a main - sequence star its visual magnitude would be 8.8 mag , i.e. 0.4mag fainter than the primary and 0.9mag brighter than the secondary component",
    ". the third star would be about 0.7mag fainter from the eclipsing pair . assuming the distance to the eclipsing pair as 854pc , and separation between the eclipsing pair and the third star as 40@xmath5 one can easily calculate an angular separation of about 0.05 arcseconds .",
    "such a star could be angularly resolved by contemporary instruments and methods . since",
    "no photometric or spectroscopic signature has been observed for the third star up to date it would be reasonable to think that this component either might not be a normal star or it is a multiple star system .",
    "this paper is dedicated to professor c. ibanoglu who spent most his life on the structure and evolution of the binary stars .",
    "he surveyed , for example , more than thirty years the exotic binary v471tauri .",
    "he and his colleagues carried out many quantitative studies of the physical properties of the close binaries .",
