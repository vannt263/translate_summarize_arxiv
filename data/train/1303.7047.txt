    "adiabatic passage is an interesting and important tool for manipulating quantum states .",
    "with adiabatic processes , one attempts to find a control strategy that maintains the system in an instantaneous eigenstate , whilst that hamiltonian is smoothly varied from some initial state to the desired final state .",
    "such control strategies have been used and proposed for a range of tasks including the manipulation of population within an atomic system  @xcite , control of chemical reactions  @xcite , control of vibrational population  @xcite , and adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "one of the tasks that adiabatic passage is particularly suited for is state transfer .",
    "state transfer is an important task in its own right , but also serves as a useful metric for evaluating new techniques .",
    "here we focus explicitly on the task of state transfer in three - state systems using the stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) @xcite and related protocols such as coherent tunneling adiabatic passage ( ctap ) @xcite , dark state adiabatic passage ( dsap ) @xcite , and adiabatic nonlinear frequency conversion @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : analog ] . in these schemes",
    "we have an effective three - state system where the states are denoted @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 with nearest neighbour tunnel matrix elements @xmath3 between states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and @xmath4 between states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the task of these protocols is to effect population transfer from state @xmath0 to @xmath2 via the dark state , or its equivalent , @xmath5 .",
    "our aim here is to discover the limitations of employing piecewise constant , i.e. digital , tunnel matrix elements , rather than the smoothly varying control that is typically thought to be required .",
    "system , where the tunnel matrix elements are the rabi frequencies of control lasers .",
    "( b ) a three - waveguide system can be used to effect ctap variation where the tunnel matrix elements are varied due to the evanescent coupling between waveguides ( c ) ctap in a triple - dot or triple - donor system is effected by gate - controlled variations in the wave function overlap of the particle between the sites .",
    "( d ) for nonlinear frequency conversion , the required coupling variation is achieved by superimposing two chirped poling functions in a periodically poled nonlinear material , assisted by two strong pump fields . ]",
    "piecewise adiabatic passage ( pap ) was introduced by shapiro _",
    "@xcite in the context of femtosecond pulse control of the internal states of atomic systems . in this case",
    "the control fields are applied for short periods of time with an overall envelope that ensures the evolution .",
    "although formally this scheme can not be considered as truly adiabatic due to the pulsed control , when viewed in the frequency domain , and observing that population can not leak between eigenstates when the control fields are off , @xcite , adiabatic - like evolution can be obtained .",
    "controls comprising sequences of short pulses have been explored quite extensively recently in the context of pap , see for example @xcite .",
    "the limits to such evolution in a general setting have also been explored by boixo and somma @xcite .    here",
    "we show the effects of employing a digital variation in the control fields , i.e. where the tunnel matrix elements are forced to vary in discrete steps , rather than smoothly .",
    "this case is especially important for adiabatic frequency conversion using periodically poled media @xcite , and the inevitable digitisation that arises from the use of digital to analog converters for electronic control signals .",
    "it is also likely that many computational models that use some form of finite element method in solving adiabatic evolution show some _ de facto _ digitisation of the style we consider here .",
    "our results show that digital control can yield state transfer approximating more conventional three - state adiabatic passage , although we identify resonances where the transport does not exhibit adiabatic - like evolution .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first introduce the hamiltonian and control scheme for the digital adiabatic passage ( dap ) .",
    "we then provide a simple analytic overestimate of the fidelity of dap .",
    "we consider two means for digitising the adiabatic passage , with uniform spacing of the pulses in time and uniform distribution of the tunnel matrix elements . both of these cases are investigated , and a method for generating dap schemes where there is uniform spacing in the control parameter is also discussed .",
    "our results show adiabatic - like evolution with resonances of no evolution , and these resonances are used to identify optimal evolution strategies within the dap framework .",
    "we consider a three - state system described by a tight - binding model , where each state is coupled only to its neighbour .",
    "this model is useful for exploring stirap - like processes , although extensions to more realistic hamiltonians have also been considered , especially in the context of spatial variations ( i.e. ctap ) , see for example @xcite .",
    "although these adiabatic processes only require energy degeneracy between the end states , for simplicity we assume that all states have the same energy . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian becomes ( with @xmath6 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 real ) @xmath7 note that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are assumed to vary according to some time - varying external control , as in the case of stirap and ctap , or spatially varying design , as in the case of adiabatic passage in waveguides or nonlinear frequency conversion with periodically poled materials . for simplicity and without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume that the @xmath8 vary as a function of time .    to understand the adiabatic evolution of the three - state system , we first solve for the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , which are    @xmath9 here @xmath10 is usually referred to as the dark state in the context of stirap , or the null state for ctap .    for adiabatic passage",
    ", the strategy to realise state transfer from @xmath0 to @xmath2 is relatively straightforward .",
    "one typically chooses some smoothly - varying control function for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with the constraints that @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the time @xmath13 varies from 0 to @xmath14 , where there is considerable overlap of the pulses for all intervening times .",
    "the functional form is relatively unimportant and many different pulse sequences have been employed .",
    "here we employ a sinusoidal control sequence @xcite such that @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : couple](a ) , where @xmath16 is the maximum tunnel matrix element .",
    "this control sequence has the advantage that none of the eigenvalues of the system vary during the adiabatic passage , i.e. @xmath17 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : couple](c ) ] .",
    "the adiabaticity parameter is a measure for how well a system stays in an instantaneous eigenstate as the hamiltonian is varied @xcite .",
    "so for any two instantaneous eigenstates @xmath18 and @xmath19 we define @xmath20 and for adiabatic evolution , we require @xmath21 . for the pulse sequences typically employed for stirap / ctap , the adiabaticity peaks either at or near the midpoint of the transfer @xcite ( for a comparison of different schemes see @xcite ) . for the case in eq .",
    "[ eq : sincos ] , however , the adiabaticity parameter is constant , namely @xmath22    we also consider a linear variation in the couplings [ fig .",
    "[ fig : couple](b ) ] , @xmath23 this scheme has the advantage of simplicity and also corresponds to systems where the control levels are equally spaced , but this scheme is less desirable for high fidelity transport , as will be shown below .",
    "the adiabaticity in the linear case is @xmath24^{-3/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : couple ] we compare the control sequences , eigenenergies and adiabaticity ( in the smoothly varying case ) for the two coupling schemes .",
    "note that the linear evolution shows the point of minimum energy separation at the midpoint of the protocol , in keeping with most of the other pulsing schemes that have been considered in the literature to date , whilst the eigenergies are constant for the sin / cos sequence .",
    "the fact that the adiabaticity for the linear sequence is larger for the same total time shows immediately that the linear scheme should be less efficient for state transfer than the sin / cos scheme .",
    "the constancy of the eigenenergies in the sin / cos scheme also has benefits for the dap , as discussed below .",
    "the aim of this work is to understand the consequences of digital control on three - state adiabatic passage protocols .",
    "it is important to realise that the concept of adiabaticity is formally inapplicable in this case , as the assumption of ideal digital control implies step function variation in the control parameters .",
    "hence adiabatic following is not strictly possible .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show , the evolution obtained by a nave digitisation of the controlling tunnel matrix elements provides evolution that typically mimics the adiabatic evolution found for smoothly varying control fields , as was the case with pap  @xcite .    for digital control ,",
    "the tunnel matrix elements are piecewise constant with time . for @xmath25 steps ,",
    "we use @xmath26 , \\quad \\omega_{2 } = \\omega_m \\cos\\left[\\frac{\\xi \\pi}{2(n-1)}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the evolution were adiabatic , then we could use adiabaticity arguments to determine the overlap of any given state with the eigenstate of the infinitesimally incremented hamiltonian .",
    "however , the digitisation introduces a series of discrete jumps . to determine an estimate of the error",
    ", we therefore look at the overlap between the null states before and after a change in the hamiltonian , reasoning that in the limit of infinitely many steps that the continuously varying hamiltonian should be approximated . due to the simple form of the digital control , the difference between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 null state is @xmath31 .",

    "however , it misses some extremely important physics , in particular the fact that population may be projected back into the null state from the other two eigenstates  @xcite , and also the fact that there will be interference in the accumulated phases of the residual population .",
    "hence the error determined in eq .",

    "again , noticeable are the resonances showing identity evolution , and also apparent are the local maxima identified above .",
    "for the linear scheme [ fig  [ fig : p3-error ] ( c ) ] , the resonances are more complicated and do not result in a perfect identity .",

    "as expected , as @xmath25 increases , the fidelity improves , except for resonance points as discussed above .",

    "however , as was evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : p3-error ] , the poor fidelity resonances are less clear in the linear scheme than for the sin / cos scheme .",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that the eigenspectrum has different values as a function of fractional time in the linear scheme , and hence the resonances are broader and less pronounced .",
    "in the previous section we considered the simplest approach with respect to timing ; the pulses defining the protocol were designed to have equal temporal extent .",
    "although conceptually straightforward , in some situations the control over the timing of pulses may be greater than the control over the level of the pulses , and hence for such situations it is more natural to consider digital schemes where the pulse length is optimised for a given digitisation level . as the ultimate limit of such control imperatives , we may consider bang - bang control as a one - bit control scheme with fine timing control @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we consider only the case where the tunnel matrix element is varied between uniformly spaced levels , however our method may be easily generalised to the case where the parameter controlling the tunnel matrix element ( e.g. a voltage level for gate - driven processes or waveguide separation for waveguide adiabatic passage ) is the uniformly spaced digital quantity .        to design the appropriate pulse length ,",

    "optimal complete transfer occurs for step @xmath60 when the length corresponds to @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "more generally , one can determine an equivalent to fig .  [",
    "fig : dirichlet ] for the compensated linear scheme , which is stretched by a factor dependent on the number of steps and the precise details of the scheme used .",
    "the compensation scheme described above provides a method to determine the pulse length for _ any _ control protocol where the @xmath63 are known . to illustrate this method for setting the pulse length",
    ", we return to the linear control scheme where we require the tunnel matrix elements to be varied between equally spaced levels .",

    "this modified control scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : linearoptimisedtime ] , which shows the control protocol as well as the shift in the pulse length relative to the uniform pulse time protocol discussed above .",
    "the optimal pulse time approach means that the pulse length at the midpoint of the protocol is longer than at the beginning or end of the protocol .",
    "interestingly , this is a similar result to that obtained from standard adiabaticity analysis , although the reason for longer pulses is different in this case .    in fig .",

    "digital adiabatic passage , when applied to three state systems , is shown to approximate conventional adiabatic passage in the limit of large @xmath25 .",

    "in addition to adiabatic - like behaviour , we also find ` resonances ' exhibiting poor transport , superimposed on the adiabatic - like evolution .",
    "these resonances of poor transport arise due to evolution over some or all of the digital steps resulting in the identity .",
    "we compared two schemes for effecting digital adiabatic passage : sin / cos and linear variation ; for uniform pulse lengths and compensated pulse lengths . without pulse length compensation ,",
    "the sin / cos scheme gave superior transport results .",
    "the overall transport was generally higher fidelity as the adiabaticity parameter of the sin / cos scheme was less than that for the linear scheme , however also the resonances of poor transport were more clearly defined due to the fact that the eigenergies were constant throughout the protocol .",
