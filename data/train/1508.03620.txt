    "among the structures shown by interacting galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , the so - called collisional ring galaxies ( theys & spiegel 1976 , 1977 ) are a rare and most distinctive sub - class ( appelton & struck - marcell 1996 ) .",
    "collisional ring galaxies occur from an almost head - on collision between a smaller galaxy travelling along the minor axis of a larger galaxy passing through , or close to , its centre ( appleton & struck - marcell 1996 ) .",
    "the shock wave sweeps up and expels gas from the system , usually leaving a gas - poor galaxy behind ( freeman & de vaucoleurs 1974 ) .",
    "the pre - eminent example is the cartwheel galaxy ( eso350 - 40 ; am0035 - 335 ) at a distance of 124mpc . the cartwheel was discovered by zwicky ( 1941 ) , and studied in - depth by fosbury & hawarden ( 1977 ) and amram et al .",
    "the cartwheel shows a spectacular ring of star formation , with interior spokes surrounding the host galaxy .",
    "other well - known collisional systems include arp148 ( mayall s object ) at 148mpc ( smith 1941 ; burbidge , burbidge & prendrgast 1964 ; arp 1966 ) , ic  298 ( arp147 ; gerber , lamb & balsara 1992 ) at 135mpc , and am0644 - 741 ( eso34 - 11 or the `` lindsay - shapley ring '' ) at 87mpc ( lindsay & shapley 1960 ; graham 1974 ; arp & madore 1987 ) .",
    "this latter object is often considered to be a typical exemplar of evolved ringed galaxies ( e.g. higdon , higdon & rand 2011 ) .    while star - forming events resulting from galactic collisions may be more common than usually thought ( e.g. block et al .",
    "2006 ) , spectacular cartwheel - type galaxies , showing complete rings ( but not necessarily with evident spokes ) , appear to be very rare in volume - limited surveys .",
    "the previous nearest example was the vela ring galaxy ( am1006 - 380 = eso316 - 43 ) , at 72mpc ( dennefeld , lausten & materne 1979 ) .",
    "partial ring galaxies are more numerous .",
    "probably the nearest in the madore , nelson & petrillo ( 2009 ) catalogue is am0322 - 374 at 20mpc .",
    "ugc9893 , at 11mpc ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2008 ) , is also listed as a collisional system , but it lacks a clear ring structure ( gil de paz & madore 2003 ) , appearing indistinct in available imagery .",
    "collisional ring galaxy systems can be identified in high- resolution , deep h@xmath1 imagery where the hii regions of the ring are readily visible .",

    "( 2004 ) , and kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have not added to the modest number of cartwheel - type galaxies currently known and there are @xmath820 convincing systems , e.g. marston & appleton 1995 .",
    "bosch et al . ( 2015 ) present the most recent detailed work on such systems for an apparently empty ring galaxy system eso474g040 at @xmath9mpc , thought to have arisen from a recent merger of two disk galaxies .",
    "collisional rings systems offer an excellent environment to study the evolution of density - wave induced starbursts ( marston & appleton 1995 ; romano , mayya & vorobyov 2008 ) , as well as the dynamic interactions between the individual galaxies ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "a closer example of a collisional ring system would allow its star formation , stellar distribution and evolution to be studied in detail , spatially , kinematically and chromatically . here",
    "we present the discovery of a new collisional ring galaxy at a distance of only 10mpc .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we present some background and describe the discovery of the ring around eso179 - 13 . in section  3",

    "section  6 presents our discussion and give our summary in section  7 .",
    "eso179 - 13 is noted as an interacting double galaxy system in simbad , appearing to consist of a near edge - on late - type spiral with another more chaotic system @xmath380arcsec to the north - east .",

    "( 1982 ) and corwin , de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs ( 1985 ) .",
    "a detailed @xmath10-band image was published by laustsen , madsen & west ( 1987 ) .",
    "woudt & kraan - korteweg ( 2001 ) identify the most prominent galaxy as wkk7460 ( componenta hereafter ) , and wkk7463 for the secondary ( component b ) . a small , third galaxy is also identified as wkk7457 to the west of componenta ( componentc ) .",
    "it agrees with our own positional determination to 1arcsec .",
    "the system , centred on componenta , is entry 391 in the h@xmath1 catalogue of kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , but they do not list integrated h@xmath1 ( + [ nii ] ) flux or luminosity estimates .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , in a related paper , included this system in their galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) ultraviolet imaging survey of local volume galaxies with a quoted @xmath11 = 15 , but no near - uv or far - uv fluxes are quoted .",
    "owing to its proximity to the galactic plane , the galaxy was not observed by galex prior to mission completion ( bianchi 2014 ) .",
    "componenta has been classified as an sb(s)m spiral in the rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) and similarly classified as sb(s)dm system ( t = 7.5 ) by buta ( 1995 ) . these independent classifications treat the system as a distinct , late - type spiral galaxy , albeit in an interaction .",
    "it can be best described as a magellanic dwarf or a magellanic spiral , similar to the lmc .",
    "a range of heliocentric radial velocities for componenta are available in the literature from both optical spectroscopic and hi measurements .",

    "we will also use @xmath21  mag based on the reddening law from howarth ( 1983 ) .",
    "apart from the basic information above , the system has been little studied because of its location in a crowded , low - latitude area near the galactic plane ( @xmath22 - 8 degrees ) and proximity to the bright , 7.7  mag a0iv star , hd150915 , located 72arcsec due south .",

    "componenta is at the centre .",
    "componentb is labelled to the north - east while the smaller compact componentc is indicated with an arrow .",
    "the shs continuum subtracted image reveals a spectacular ring of emission knots not obvious , without context , even in the h@xmath1 image while the main componenta galaxy has almost disappeared .",
    "the ring is approximately ( but not perfectly ) centred on componenta .",
    "surprisingly , given its previous spiral morphological classification , componenta does not show up well in the shs continuum subtracted image and appears to show little star formation .",
    "this indicates that along with its apparently highly elongated nature ( so not an elliptical ) it is has been largely stripped of gas .",
    "the smaller , more irregular galaxy ( componentb ) shows extensive , clumpy h@xmath1 emission . a third , faint compact system ( componentc )",
    "is seen 38arcsec to the west of componenta , identified as wkk7457 .",
    "this object is clear in the broad - band @xmath10 , @xmath24 and @xmath25-band supercosmos images and is also undergoing star - formation .",
    "the strong hi detection noted earlier indicates that a significant , neutral hi component still remains within the overall system environment .",
    "the lack of much star formation in componenta suggests that most of this hi may be located outside of its inner disk .",
    "discovery of this collisional ring system led us first to investigate and compile existing multi - wavelength data from the archives .",
    "we then obtained deeper , higher resolution imaging and spectroscopy of the major emission components ( see below ) , to provide estimates of some key physical parameters for this system .",
    "high resolution imagery at the blanco 4-m telescope at ctio was obtained in june 2008 using the wide field mosaic camera .",
    "we used five filters : @xmath26-band , h@xmath27 , h@xmath1 off - band ( 80  redward of h@xmath1 ) , , and a ( wider ) off - band filter centred at 5300 .",
    "the field of view is 30arcmin on a side and the plate scale 0.26arcsecpx@xmath0 .",
    "the seeing measured from the data frames was typically 1.2arcsec .",
    "exposures were 5 minutes for the emission - line and off - band filters , and 60s for the @xmath26-band filter .",
    "the airmass during the exposures averaged 1.3 . to subtract the continuum ,",
    "the h@xmath1 off - band image was scaled down by a factor of 0.88 , and the off - band by a factor of 0.14 , to compensate for the filter widths .",
    "these factors were established by minimizing residuals for a set of selected field stars .",
    "for that works very well and results are in good agreement with the filter curve .",
    "for h@xmath1 this can be an issue if the chosen stars have h@xmath1 in absorption .",
    "this does not appear to be the case for the field stars chosen which provide a consistent scale - factor to @xmath28 .",
    "it is best to minimize stellar residuals rather than filter curves as stars are a more important contribution to the continuum than bound - free emission from hi regions .    a montage of these ctio images is shown in fig .",
    "they reveal the distribution and variety of the emission structures as well as data for quantitative flux estimates . from these deeper",
    ", higher resolution ctio h@xmath1 and continuum subtracted images the distribution of ionised gas is seen to be far more complex than is evident from the shs discovery data .",
    "the leftmost panel is a @xmath29arcminute ctio h@xmath1 image with the off - band frame subtracted .",
    "we avoid the bright star to the south where ccd blooming is serious .",
    "emission associated with componentc and at the southern tip of componenta s disk previously gave the impression of a circular ring in the shs as the bright star obscured emission further south .",
    "the higher resolution ctio data reveals an elliptical emission ring with a major - axis diameter of 127arcsec ( @xmath36.2kpc ) .",
    "the inscribed oval was positioned to fit the prominent emission now seen to extend further south .",
    "the ellipse is not centred on componenta , but at 16h47m19.5s , @xmath3057@xmath3126 44  ( j2000 ) , @xmath313arcsec ( or @xmath30.6kpc ) south - south - east .",
    "some low - level h@xmath1 emission is now seen across componenta , surrounding componentb and with faint , localised emission features and blobs around the entire system .",
    "an interesting feature is the elongated nature of some of these emission knots in a north - east direction from a to b. the main emission features follow the equivalent h@xmath1 structures though at typically a third to a half of their native integrated pixel intensities .",
    "the mid panel is the matching ctio continuum subtracted image ( narrow on and off - band images used ) .",
    "both these images are presented at 90% linear scaling to reveal the full extent of the emission ( this sets the upper and lower limits based on the 90% pixel intensity level where a histogram of the data is created and the limits are set to display the percentage about the mean value ) . with full pixel range",
    ", saturated pixels from the 7.7th magnitude star hd150915 would prevent detail being seen .",
    "low level diffuse flux is seen for componenta but it is not conspicuous .",
    "this shows it has almost been completely cancelled out indicating componenta is mostly composed of normal starlight .",
    "the right hand panel is the off - band filter image ( 5300 ) that effectively represents the @xmath26-band starlight without the + h@xmath32 emission line contribution .",
    "this shows dust lanes along and at the south - west extremity of the disk , concentrated starlight from componentsa , b and c and an envelope of diffuse starlight around the entire system .",
    "this  common envelope \" was already noted by laustsen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) from old @xmath10-band photographic data taken with the eso 3.6-m telescope in the 1980s .",
    "this raises an interesting question and also a possible explanation for why the apparent axial ratios of the highly elongated componenta differs so much from the surrounding oval ring .",
    "currently known collisional ring systems with low impact parameter have axial ratios that are broadly similar to that of the target galaxy .",
    "such arrangements are a natural consequence of the copious gas and ism being swept up and compressed by the resultant density wave having a similar radial ( and perhaps also vertical ) distribution as the target galaxy stellar content .",
    "this does not appear to be the case here unless what we are actually seeing is the residual , less - inclined bar of a more face - on disk system that extends out to the entire ring and whose presence can still be seen in the low - level diffuse starlight refereed to earlier .",
    "if componenta is not a residual bar but a distinct late - type disk galaxy ( as commonly assumed ) stripped of gas , then the gas distribution could have become less flattened somehow .",
    "alternatively the original target galaxy could have been stretched out along the direction of the impact towards componentb before , during or even after the bulls - eye collision occurred .",
    "though componentb is only 13@xmath33 of the mass ( in stars ) of componenta these effects could have been strengthened due to the low ` magellanic'-type masses of the system as a whole .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ ctio - rgb ] is a composite red , green blue ( rgb ) ctio image displaying the system s spectacular nature .",
    "the red channel is h@xmath1 , the green and the blue broadband v. componenta is mostly star - light with dust lanes evident in this higher resolution data .",
    "the few small hii knots appear red , likely due to dust extinction within the disk .",
    "based on the shs data , literature data and our new ctio images , table [ fund_data ] presents some key parameters for galaxy components a , b and c , including the central position of the best fit ellipse to the main emission ring . the position for componenta",
    "is tied to the 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) near - ir imagery and astrometry .",
    "the positions refer to the centre of each assumed galaxy .",
    "the centre of componenta is derived from the dominant starlight in the @xmath24-band .",
    "the separation between the centres of componentsa and b is @xmath380arcsec .",
    "using the distance of 10mpc gives a projected separation between them of 3.9kpc .",
    "componenta has a major - axis of @xmath386arcsec ( 4.2kpc ) measured to the outer edge in the stellar continuum from off - band and @xmath26-band ctio images where a decline in the background is seen before the star - forming ring is encountered . when checked against the broad band @xmath24 , @xmath25 and 2mass images when autocut at the 90% pixel intensity level the disk appears to extend only to 70 - 80arcsec . at low isophotal thresholds starlight",

    "<S> we report the discovery of the closest collisional ring galaxy to the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> such rare systems occur due to `` bulls - eye '' encounters between two reasonably matched galaxies . the recessional velocity of about 840kms@xmath0 is low enough that it was detected in the aao / ukst survey for galactic h@xmath1 emission . </S>",
    "<S> the distance is only 10.0mpc and the main galaxy shows a full ring of star forming knots , 6.1kpc in diameter surrounding a quiescent disk . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller assumed  bullet \" galaxy also shows vigorous star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the spectacular nature of the object had been overlooked because of its location in the galactic plane and proximity to a bright star and even though it is the 60@xmath2 brightest galaxy in the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) hi survey .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall system has a physical size of @xmath315kpc , a total mass of @xmath4m@xmath5 ( stars + hi ) , a metallicity of [ o / h]@xmath6 , and a star formation rate of 0.2 - 0.5m@xmath5yr@xmath0 , making it a magellanic - type system . </S>",
    "<S> collisional ring galaxies therefore extend to much lower galaxy masses than commonly assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a space density for such systems of @xmath7 , an order of magnitude higher than previously estimated . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests kathryn s wheel is the nearest such system . </S>",
    "<S> we present discovery images , ctio 4-m telescope narrow - band follow - up images and spectroscopy for selected emission components . given its proximity and modest extinction along the line of sight , this spectacular system provides an ideal target for future high spatial resolution studies of such systems and for direct detection of its stellar populations .    </S>",
