    "this paper deals with the study of a class of nonlinear second order odes which was proposed by chen and bell @xcite as a model for a nerve fiber with spines . in their model ,",
    "the authors consider a nerve fiber as an infinitely long cable . the spines , which are small protrusions on the membrane , are assumed to be periodically distributed .",
    "their population is characterized by a density @xmath3 and by a lumped ohmic resistance @xmath4 of the spine stem .",
    "the current flowing through the spine stem is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent two membrane potentials ( @xmath8 is the one corresponding to the dendrite , while @xmath9 is that at the spine head ) .",
    "chen and bell , following the cable theory approach previously considered by baer and rinzel @xcite and simplifying the active membrane dynamics from the hodgkin - huxley form to the fitzhugh - nagumo s , derived the following system @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant such that @xmath12 represents the dendritic membrane resistance and @xmath13 has the typical cubic form of the nagumo equation @xcite .",
