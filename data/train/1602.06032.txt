    "the first quantitative statement of heat production in finite systems was provided by the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) of evans , cohen and morris in 1993  @xcite .",
    "the theorem relates the probabilities of observing a positive value of the time averaged dissipative flux and a negative one of the same magnitude in a thermostatted dissipative system .",
    "it was first demonstrated in a molecular dynamics simulation of a sheared two - dimensional fluid of hard disks  @xcite .",
    "several classifications of the ft exist .",
    "the _ steady state _ and _ transient _ fts differ in the ensemble of trajectory segments considered . in the stationary state fluctuation theorem ( ssft ) , such as in the original work of evans _",
    "@xcite , the trajectories of fixed duration @xmath0 belong to the driven steady state and the ft becomes valid in the limit @xmath1 . in the transient ft ( tft )  @xcite , the segments belong to a system initially in an equilibrium state evolving into a non - equilibrium steady state  @xcite .    another classification is based on whether the fluctuation statistics are for a _",
    "global _ or _ local _ quantity .",
    "the ft of evans _",
    "et al _ was for fluctuations in the total entropy production which is a global quantity .",
    "gallavotti and cohen  @xcite provided a rigorous mathematical derivation of this theorem and in addition rederived a ft for the average of local observables .",
    "this local ft is easier to test experimentally as negative fluctuations , too rare to be observed experimentally in global quantities , are more prevalent in local quantities .",
    "moreover , it does not require steady state conditions to hold globally and can be applied when it holds only locally .    to put our work in context , it is essential to distinguish between the ft of evans and searles  @xcite and that of gallavotti and cohen  @xcite .",
    "the former is a statement of fluctuations in the dissipative flux of thermostatted non - equilibrium states .",
    "it provides an expression for the probability of a dissipative flux in the direction opposite to that required by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "it requires that the initial state or distribution satisfies the condition of ergodic consistency .",
    "the gallavotti - cohen ft  @xcite is more general and applies to non - equilibrium systems driven far from equilibrium into nonlinear chaotic regimes .",
    "it depends crucially on the chaotic hypothesis which imposes certain conditions on systems to which it can be applied .",
    "our system which is a dissipative stochastic system driven far from equilibrium falls under this category .",
    "we show that the energy flux averaged over a duration @xmath0 , @xmath2 , satisfies the gallavotti - cohen ft @xmath3 in the steady state .",
    "@xmath4 defines an effective temperature .",
    "both fts have been validated in several systems .",
    "the evans - searles ft has been verified in a number of molecular dynamics simulations , electrical resistor circuits @xcite , and for a colloidal particle in an optical trap  @xcite .",
    "the gallavotti - cohen ft has been satisfied in many real systems such as in turbulent flows  @xcite , turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite , vertically agitated granular gas  @xcite and in a sheared micellar gel  @xcite .",
    "our system mimics a fluid under shear at constant strain rate and exhibits a rich phase behaviour similar to that seen in real complex fluids under shear  @xcite . unlike in the isoenergetic simulations of a sheared two dimensional fluid  @xcite , the heat and energy flux have different statistics in our system and the dynamics is not time reversal invariant .",
    "we show that eqn.(1 ) is satisfied in all phases of the system and study the variation of the effective temperature , @xmath5 , with the strain rate , strength of the stochastic force and relation to changes in phase .",
    "we show that @xmath6 can also be obtained from the large deviation function ( ldf ) of the energy flux .",
    "finally , we analyse the statistics of fluctuations in the local strain rate .",
    "our _ model fluid _ is the classical one - dimensional @xmath7 model of a lattice of spins or rotors ( figure  [ fig : rotor ] ) , each of which can rotate perpendicular to the lattice .",
    "the angle @xmath8 of the spin @xmath9 is the only degree of freedom of each rotor or spin .",
    "each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbours via torsional forces . in the equilibrium model",
    "these are forces arising from the interaction potential @xmath10 .",
    "+      model . the angle @xmath11 and velocity @xmath12 of each rotor characterizes the state of the system at each instant.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to generate the non - equilibrium steady states of this model , the rotors are subjected to langevin dynamics .",
    "in addition to the conservative force given by @xmath13 , frictional and stochastic forces are included that conserve total angular momentum .",
    "the net torsional force on each rotor determines its angular acceleration according to newton s law of motion , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the moment of inertia of each rotor which is unity in the chosen units and @xmath16 the total torque acting on rotor @xmath17 .",
    "this has three contributions : conservative , dissipative and random , each of which is pairwise additive and acts along @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relative angular separation between rotors @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 the conservative torque , @xmath22 .",
    "the frictional torque depends only on the relative velocity between rotors and has the simple form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the frictional co - efficient .",
    "the random torque @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the amplitude of the random torque and @xmath27 is a gaussian random variable of unit variance .",
    "the system is driven by rotating one of its boundaries relative to the other .",
    "this is done using lees - edwards boundary condition for the angle variable which allows us to impose a relative velocity @xmath28 between the boundaries of the system along with periodic boundary conditions so that edge effects are eliminated .",
    "the imposed strain rate is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of rotors .",
    "the model has been used earlier to measure transition rates in non - equilibrium steady states and its rich phase behaviour likened to the phenomenology of real complex fluids under shear  @xcite . a model that bears some similarity to ours",
    "is the sheared solid model  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eoms ] ) are integrated forward in time using a self - consistent dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the time step of integration @xmath31 is chosen such that the relative motion between rotors per time step is not greater than 0.24 .",
    "the system exhibits four qualitatively distinct phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase ] depicts the various phases observed as a function of the imposed strain rate , @xmath32 and noise amplitude ( expressed in terms of @xmath33 ) for fixed @xmath34 .",
    "we distinguish between these phases based on the distribution of the time - averaged local strain rate ( @xmath35 ) in the system .",
    "the following four phases are observed : ( i ) uniform shear phase - the average local shear rate is the same through out the system .",
    "this phase exists at high @xmath26 and @xmath36 where thermal and frictional forces are much larger than the conservative force @xmath37 .",
    "uniform shear implies a linear average velocity profile .",
    "all newtonian fluids shear uniformly .",
    "in complex fluids , a uniform shear flow regime always exists ( figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "( ii ) slip plane phase - the shear in this phase is localized to a few neighbouring rotors ( or planes ) while the majority move without any relative motion between their neighbours as in a elastic solid ( figure 2(d ) ) .",
    "this phase is observed when the thermal energy is small and the average torque is less than the maximum potential gradient .",
    "relative motion at the slip plane produces an oscillatory torque that propagates in the solid region as damped torsional waves .",
    "slip planes have been observed in surfactant cubic phases  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) solid - fluid coexistence - this phase is created when the yield event at a slip plane triggers more yeild events locally giving rise to a finite region that s fluid ( where the rotors overcome the potential barrier ) , co - existing with solid regions ( figure 2(e ) ) .",
    "this co - existence is possible only when the local time averaged stress is just below the yield point .",
    "such phases have been observed in foams  @xcite .",
    "( iv ) shear banding - the local shear rate assumes two or more values , forming regions of different effective viscosities ( figure 2(c ) ) .",
    "each of these regions is called a band .",
    "shear banding has been observed in polymers  @xcite",
    ". a precise characterization of these phases along with a mean field analysis of the model s phase behaviour can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for the range of @xmath32 and @xmath26 studied ( at fixed value of @xmath38 ) , we do not see a turbulent phase in this system . however , we expect to see turbulence for large @xmath39 , large system size , and by reducing the value of the frictional co - efficient @xmath40 .",
    "we restrict our study here to properties of the driven steady state which is attained after an initial transient behaviour . in the steady state , the rate of change of the total energy @xmath41 , where the energy flux or power @xmath42 is the rate at which work is done on the system by the driving force and the heat flux @xmath43 is the heat dissipated per unit time .",
    "since the system is sheared at constant strain rate , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the net torque between neighbouring rotors on either side of the sheared boundary .",
    "the distribution of @xmath45 is therefore the distribution of the shear stress in the system .",
    "the frictional coefficient and the interaction potential are kept fixed in our simulations while the strain rate ( @xmath32 ) and noise amplitude ( @xmath26 ) are varied .",
    "the shear stress of the system fluctuates about a positive mean value and assumes both positive and negative values . shown in figure  [ fig : fluctuation ]",
    "is a typical time evolution of the shear stress @xmath46 averaged over duration @xmath0 for a system of @xmath47 rotors in the shear banding phase . to find the probability distribution @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 is recorded as the system evolves in the steady state over a long duration of time ( corresponding to a few hundred revolutions of each rotor ) and over many realizations of the random torque .",
    "@xmath50 , which is the time it takes for a rotor experiencing a local shear rate @xmath32 to complete one revolution , defines a timescale .",
    "the data is then averaged over different durations @xmath0 larger than any correlation time ( @xmath51 ) in the system . in some cases",
    "the window of averaging is shifted from a previous one by a time larger than the correlation time to improve sampling .",
    "the distribution of the resulting averaged data is @xmath48 . the average energy flux into the system in a duration @xmath0 is @xmath52 ; and @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath6 can be calculated from the slope of the collapsed line .",
    "it quantifies the probability of observing negative shear in the system ; a large @xmath6 corresponds to a higher probability of finding the system with negative shear stress .    when the fluctuations are gaussian distributed , the probability distribution @xmath60 .",
    "this would then imply @xmath61 comparing this with the ratio of the probabilities according to the gallavotti - cohen ft ( 1 ) , we get @xmath62 the left hand side ( lhs ) is a quantity that involves the standard deviation and mean of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the temperature @xmath63 is the thermodynamic temperature when the system is in the linear response regime .",
    "it is the effective temperature , @xmath5 , when the system is not in the linear response regime and the fluctuations are gaussian distributed .",
    "the quantity on the lhs of ( [ gauss ] ) is also related to the curvature of the ldf at its minimum and its derivative at @xmath64 for gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we test if this relation holds generally when the fluctuations are not gaussian in sec.3.2 .    the probability distribution for @xmath65 in the various phases is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_phase ] .",

    "the distribution in the shear banding phase is nearly gaussian but deviates from it far away from the mean .",

    "its variation with @xmath32 is different in each phase .",

    "it is proportional to @xmath75 in each of the phases albeit with a different constant of proportionality .",
    "we present our results for the variation of the effective temperature with the noise amplitude , @xmath26 , in terms of @xmath76 , the temperature at equilibrium given by the fluctuation dissipation theorem for the same @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : teff_sig ] shows how @xmath6 varies with @xmath77 for systems of size n = 10 and n = 100 . at @xmath78 , we find that @xmath79 as indicated by the black solid line corresponding to @xmath80 .",
    "this is not true as the system size increases where it deviates considerably from @xmath77 even when the strain rate is small .",
    "the weak dependence for small @xmath30 suggests a crossover length ( @xmath81 ) below which nothing happens .",
    "an analysis of the system size dependence of @xmath6 , for fixed values of @xmath26 and @xmath32 , indicates that it increases linearly with system size ( see fig .",
