    "knowledge of the behavior of heat fluctuations has an intrinsic value , especially for small systems such as nano - systems and bio - molecules , where the fluctuations are relatively large , but the wide - spread interest in fluctuation theorems ( fts ) stems mostly from the fact that although there are few general results in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , these theorems seem to provide some .",

    "theory , the quantity @xmath2 pertains to fluctuations in the `` phase space contraction rate '' @xcite , while in stochastic systems , @xmath2 involves an `` action functional''@xcite . in specific cases ,",
    "both have been connected with the heat or entropy production .",
    "such a connection is based on the expression of the phase space contraction rate and the action functional , respectively , which typically have the form of a thermodynamic force times a current , divided by the temperature of the system@xcite , i.e. , the same form as the entropy production in irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "it is however not necessary to make the connection with the entropy production and in this paper , we will simply use the heat .",
    "there are in fact two different kinds of fts : a transient ( tft ) and a stationary state ft ( ssft ) .",
    "while the conventional ssft only holds for sufficiently large ( strictly infinite ) times , the conventional tft holds as an identity for all times@xcite .",
    "thus , for the ssft , the @xmath6 sign in eq .",

    "apart from an ( early ) laboratory experiment on the ssft@xcite , the fts were restricted to theoretical and simulation approaches : it was difficult to make laboratory experiments on macroscopic systems , since the large number of particles reduces all fluctuations enormously .",
    "recently , wang _",

    "[ theorymodel ] ) , explain the difference between work and heat in the model ( [ theoryworkheat ] ) , and treat the work - related ssft and tft fully ( [ theorywork ] ) . for the heat fluctuations",
    "there is no expression for the pdf in terms of known functions , but its fourier transform can be calculated exactly ( [ theoryheat ] ) . since this has no known exact inverse , we first calculate , in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] , the pdf of the fluctuations using two numerical methods : a sampling method as well as the algorithm of the fast fourier transform to perform the inversion of the fourier transform .",
    "the results of both methods agree well with each other and point to violations of the conventional ssft and tft .",
    "next , this is substantiated by an analytic method developed sec .",

    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "at the end , two appendices give some technical details used in the text .",
    "theoretical descriptions of the experiment of wang _ et al._@xcite have been given even before the experiment by mazonka and jarzynski@xcite , as well as recently by the authors@xcite .",
