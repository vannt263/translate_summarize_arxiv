    "benth and ortiz - latorre  @xcite analysed a structure preserving class of pricing measures for ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) processes with applications to forward pricing in commodity markets . in particular , they considered multi - factor ou models driven by lvy processes having positive jumps ( so - called subordinators ) or brownian motions for the spot price dynamics and analysed the risk premium when the level and speed of mean reversion in these factor processes were changed .    in this paper",
    "we continue this study for ou processes driven by brownian motion , but with a stochastic volatility perturbing the driving noise .",
    "the stochastic volatility process is modelled again as an ou process , but driven by a subordinator .",
    "this class of stochastic volatility models were first introduced by barndorff - nielsen and shephard  @xcite for equity prices , and later analysed by benth  @xcite in commodity markets .",
    "indeed , the present paper is considering a class of pricing measures preserving the affine structure of the spot price model analysed in benth  @xcite .",
    "our spot price dynamics is a generalization of the schwartz model ( see schwartz  @xcite ) to account for stochastic volatility .",
    "the schwartz model have been applied to many different commodity markets , including oil ( see schwartz  @xcite ) , power ( see lucia and schwartz  @xcite ) , weather ( see benth and altyt benth  @xcite ) and freight ( see benth , koekebakker and taib  @xcite ) . like lucia and schwartz  @xcite , we analyse both geometric and arithmetic models for the spot price evolution . there exists many extensions of the model , typically allowing for more factors in the spot price dynamics , as well as modelling the convenience yield and interest rates ( see eydeland and wolyniec  @xcite and geman  @xcite for more on such models ) . in benth",
    "@xcite , the schwartz model with stochastic volatility has been applied to model empirically uk gas prices .",
    "also other stochastic volatility models like the heston have been suggested in the context of commodity markets ( see eydeland and wolyniec  @xcite and geman  @xcite for a discussion and further references ) .",
    "the class of pricing measures we study here allows for a simultaneous change of speed and level of mean reversion for both the ( logarithmic ) spot price and the stochastic volatility process .",
    "the mean reversion level can be flexibly shifted up or down , while the speed of mean reversion can be slowed down .",
    "it significantly extends the esscher transform , which only allows for changes in the level of mean reversion .",
    "indeed , it decomposes the risk premium into a price and volatility premium .",
    "it has been studied empirically in some commodity markets for multi - factor models in benth , cartea and pedraz  @xcite . as we show",
    ", the class of pricing measures preserves the affine structure of the model , but leads to a rather complex stochastic driver for the stochastic volatility . for the arithmetic spot model we can derive analytic forward prices and risk premium curves . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometric model is far more complex , but the affine structure can be exploited to reduce the forward pricing to solving a system of riccati equations by resorting to the theory of kallsen and muhle - karbe  @xcite .",
    "the forward price becomes a function of both the spot and the volatility , and has a deterministic asymptotic dynamics when we are far from maturity .    by careful analysis of the associated system of riccati equations , we can study the implied risk premium of our class of measure change as a function of its parameters .",
    "the risk premium is defined as the difference between the forward price and the predicted spot price at maturity , and is a notion of great importance in commodity markets since it measures the price for entering a forward hedge position in the commodity ( see e.g. geman  @xcite for more on this ) . in particular , under rather mild assumptions on the parameters , we can show that the risk premium may change sign stochastically , and may be positive for short times to maturity and negative when maturity is farther out in time .",
    "this is a profile of the risk premium that one may expect in power markets based on both economical and empirical findings .",
    "geman and vasicek  @xcite argue that retailers in the power market may induce a hedging pressure by entering long positions in forwards to protect themselves against sudden price increases ( spikes ) .",
    "this may lead to positive risk premia , whereas producers induce a negative premium in the long end of the forward curve since they hedge by selling their production .",
    "this economic argument for a positive premium in the short end is backed up by empirical evidence from the german power market found in benth , cartea and kiesel  @xcite . in the geometric model ,",
    "we show that the sign of the risk premium depends explicitly on the current level of the logarithmic spot price .",
    "we recover the esscher transform in a special case of our pricing measure .",
    "the esscher transform is a popular tool for introducing a pricing measure in commodity markets , or , equivalently , to model the risk premium . for constant market prices of risk , which are defined as the shift in level of mean reversion , we preserve the affine structure of the model as well as the lvy property of the driving noises of the two ou processes that we consider ( indeed , the spot price dynamics is driven by a brownian motion ) .",
    "we find such pricing measures in for example lucia and schwartz  @xcite , kolos and ronn  @xcite and schwartz and smith  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to benth , altyt benth and koekebakker  @xcite for a thorough discussion and references to the application of esscher transform in power and related markets .",
    "we note that the esscher transform was first introduced and applied to insurance as a tool to model the premium charged for covering a given risk exposure and later adopted in pricing in incomplete financial markets ( see gerber and shiu  @xcite ) . in many ways , in markets where the underlying commodity is not storable ( that is , can not be traded in a portfolio ) , the pricing of forwards and futures can be viewed as an exercise in determining an insurance premium",
    ". our more general change of measure is still structure preserving , however , risk is priced also in the sense that one slows down the speed of mean reversion .",
    "such a reduction allow the random fluctuations of the spot and the stochastic volatility last longer under the pricing measure than under the objective probability , and thus spreads out the risk .",
    "although our analysis has a clear focus on the stylized facts of the risk premium in power markets , the proposed class of pricing measures is clearly also relevant in other commodity markets .",
    "as already mentioned , markets like weather and freight share some similarities with power in that the underlying `` spot '' is not storable .",
    "also in more classical commodity markets like oil and gas there are evidences of stochastic volatility and spot prices following a mean - reversion dynamics , at least as a component of the spot .",
    "moreover , in the arithmetic case our analysis relates to the concept of unspanned volatility in commodity markets , extensively studied by trolle and schwartz  @xcite .",
    "the forward price will not depend on the stochastic volatility factor , and hence one can not hedge options by forwards alone .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding geometric model will in fact span the stochastic volatility .",
    "we present our results as follows . in the next section we present the spot model , and follow up in section 3 with introducing our pricing measure validating that this is indeed an equivalent probability . in section 4",
    "we derive forward prices under the arithmetic spot price model , and analyse the implied risk premium .",
    "section 5 considers the corresponding forward prices and the implied risk premium for the geometric spot price model .",
    "here we exploit the affine structure of the model to analyse the associated riccati equation , and provide insight into the potential risk premium profiles that our set - up can generate . both section 4 and 5",
    "have numerous empirical examples .",
