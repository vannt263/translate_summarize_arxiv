    "the electromagnetic transition of the @xmath2(1232 ) resonance to the nucleon @xmath9 is of particular interest  @xcite as far as our understanding of the structure of the latter is concerned .",
    "historically ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , this reaction raised a lot of interest because it allowed one to probe the issue of whether the nucleon or its first resonance is `` deformed''the reason being that apart from the dominant magnetic dipole ( @xmath10 ) transition electromagnetic selection rules also allow an electric ( @xmath11 ) and a coulomb ( @xmath12 ) quadruple transition , which vanish in simple models of the nucleon with spherical symmetry .",
    "accordingly , the amount of deformation can be quantified by the multipole ratios emr@xmath13 and cmr@xmath14 , which acquire a four - momentum ( squared ) dependence in the case of virtual photons @xmath15 .    by the late 1990s",
    "there is nearly uniform consensus in the physics community that indeed there exist a small quadrupole components in the electromagnetic @xmath16 transition @xcite . in the case of real photons",
    "one nowadays believes an re@xmath17\\approx-1/\\%\\ldots -4\\%$ ] , but a more precise determination of this fundamental property of the nucleon has been surprisingly elusive and hotly contested throughout the past decade , both among theorists and among experimentalists .",
    "it is our hope that the ongoing experiments @xcite of electroproduction of @xmath2(1232 ) with the resulting better information on @xmath3-dependence of the @xmath16-transition form factors , as well as on emr@xmath18 , cmr@xmath18 will lead to clear picture of the underlying physics and enable us to identify the relevant degrees of freedom for several different regimes of momentum transfer .",
    "a dramatic change of the physics underlying the electromagnetic @xmath16 transition is very much expected from _ perturbative _ qcd , which predicts for `` large '' @xmath19 that emr@xmath20 .",
    "at which finite @xmath21 the crossover from a negative to a positive emr should happen and whether this point is kinematically accessible at present / future electron scattering machines is a further issue of current debate and interest , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "> from a theorist s perspective , treatments of the electromagnetic @xmath16 transition may be grouped into two categories :    1 .",
    "calculations of the electromagnetic @xmath22 vertex with its associated 3 complex form factors _ per se _ , using different theoretical frameworks that aspire to fundamentally - based descriptions of the @xmath23 system . the chiral bag model(_e.g .",
    "_  @xcite ) , quark models with meson exchange currents ( _ e.g _  @xcite ) , lattice gauge theory ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) and effective chiral lagrangians ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) constitute such attempts .",
    "direct theoretical treatments  @xcite of the full scattering processes ( _ e.g. _ @xmath24 ) in the @xmath2(1232 ) resonance region , either based on phenomenological lagrangians supplemented with a method of choice to unitarize the amplitudes or dispersion relations .",
    "a point of strong contention therein is the issue of separation of background vs. resonance contributions .",
    "for a recent summary of the status of the resulting emr / cmr extractions we refer to the talk by workman  @xcite .    in the present work we calculate the @xmath2(1232 ) to @xmath25 radiative transition @xmath9 in the region of small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath26 gev@xmath27 ) photon virtuality , utilizing a recently developed effective chiral lagrangian approach @xcite that systematically incorporates the spontaneous and the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "a small scale @xmath28 denoting , collectively , small momenta , the pion mass and the delta - nucleon mass splitting is used to establish a systematic power - counting , thus telling us precisely which diagrams / vertices have to be included if we want to calculate up to a certain order in @xmath29 .",
    "this approach allows for an efficient inclusion of @xmath2(1232 ) degrees of freedom consistent with the underlying chiral symmetry of qcd and is referred to as the `` small scale expansion '' ( sse ) @xcite , constituting a phenomenological extension of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the formalism can be used to _ calculate _ both the vertex as well as full scattering amplitudes  here we focus on the former . clearly , as we are dealing with a _ low energy _",
    "effective theory , the @xmath3 dependence of a given physical quantity can be trusted only at low valuesgev@xmath27 regime @xcite . ] .",
    "accordingly , our final applications will be discussed in this spirit .",
    "the most general form of the @xmath0 radiative decay amplitude that complies with lorentz covariance , gauge invariance and parity conservation is described by three form factors .",
    "we begin our discussion from the widely used form @xmath30u^\\m_\\d(p_\\delta ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the nucleon mass , @xmath32 denotes the relativistic four - momentum of the nucleon , delta and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the photon momentum and polarization vectors , respectively .",
    "the delta is described via a rarita - schwinger spinor @xmath35 with free lorentz index @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 multipoles allowed in @xmath37 electromagnetic transitions can be cast as linear combinations of the form factors @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the radiative vertex to @xmath1 in the above mentioned sse formalism .",
    "this constitutes the first order where pion - nucleon and pion - delta loop graphs enter the vertex .",
    "as will be shown later , an @xmath1 calculation entails corrections up to @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "one of the main tasks during this calculation has been the consistent matching between the results of our perturbative calculation and the most general vertex parameterization as given for example in eq.([eq1 ] ) . in order to provide for a stringent test of our new predictions with experiment we note that a complementary calculation of the full pion photoproduction amplitude in the @xmath2(1232 ) region to the same order in @xmath42 is in progress @xcite .",
    "there have been previous analyses of the radiative transition in a similar theoretical approach by butler et al .",
    "@xcite and by napsuciale and lucio  @xcite .",
    "our work differs from the aforementioned references in the following aspects :    * the most crucial difference is that we address the _ form factors _ and not just the real - photon point .",
    "this entails ( a ) a @xmath3 dependence in our expressions and ( b ) the presence of an additional form factor ( @xmath39 ) , or , equivalently , our calculation yields the cmr@xmath18 , in addition to the emr@xmath18 . *",
    "sse systematically keeps track of @xmath43 ( i.e. , relativistic ) corrections to lower order couplings .",
    "these corrections have not been included in previous analyses @xcite .",
    "we also find that our identification of the form factors differs from the one used in @xcite at the real photon point .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the essentials of the `` small scale expansion '' and its power counting . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the most general form of the pauli - reduced transition amplitude which is consistent with the @xmath44 calculation in the sse .",
    "we then proceed , in section iv , to calculate the loop as well as chiral counterterm contributions .",
    "the resulting expressions for the form factors are identified in section v , while those for the multipoles in section vi .",
    "numerical values for the @xmath45 using presently available ( theoretical ) input are furnished in section vii . in the same section",
    "we give numerical as well as analytical results for ( complex ) slopes of the three form factors .",
    "we summarize and offer our perspective for future efforts in the concluding section .",
    "finally , we devote an appendix to the discussion of technical matters .",
    "qcd being a strongly coupled theory at low ( of the order of 1 gev ) energies , renders traditional perturbative expansions in the coupling constant inadequate .",
    "chiral perturbation theory offers an alternative perturbative expansion , namely one that is realized in terms of the external momenta involved in a given physical process .",
    "the original strategy was based on the notion that at low energies an effective theory of qcd will involve only the nearly massless ( i.e. the goldstone bosons : pions etc . )",
    "degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , chiral perturbation theory has been very successful with respect to applications in the meson sector . with the inclusion of baryons",
    ", however , the systematic power counting of chpt fails , since baryon masses @xmath46 gev ) can not join the set of the expansion parameters @xmath47 as they are by no means small and remain finite in the chiral limit .    a systematic power counting can , nevertheless , be defined through a splitting of the nucleonic field degrees of freedom into heavy - light modes and integrating out the former .",
    "the cost of this procedure is to burden the effective description with additional , higher order contact interactions .",
    "generalizing recent developments in heavy quark effective theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) heavy fermion methods were first applied to baryon chiral perturbation theory by jenkins and manohar  @xcite .",
    "the basic premise is the adoption of a non - relativistic mode of description , which entails a restriction to four - velocities of the form @xmath48 . on an operational level",
    "this means that all momentum dependence in the theory is only governed by ( non - relativistic ) soft momenta @xmath49 , defined via @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a typical nucleon relativistic four - momentum and @xmath52 corresponds to the nucleon mass in the chiral limit .",
    "the range of validity of the resulting effective theory demands that each component @xmath53 , with the chiral symmetry breaking scale being @xmath54gev . this approach is commonly referred to as heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) .    in the construction of the effective theory we will follow the systematics laid out in @xcite .",
    "the general philosophy is to take the fully relativistic theory as the starting point and then perform a systematic non - relativistic reduction .",
    "this procedure automatically guarantees the proper @xmath43 corrections to the couplings in higher order lagrangian terms .",
    "alternatively , one could start from a general lagrangian within the non - relativistic framework , but then has to implement the so called `` reparameterization invariance '' .",
    "the latter approach is , for example , quite common in the field of heavy quark effective theories @xcite .",
    "we now briefly sketch the derivation of the ( non - relativistic ) chiral lagrangians for matter fields .",
    "for details we refer the extensive literature of reviews ( _ e.g. _ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite )    we start from the chiral relativistic su(2 ) lagrangian for nucleons @xmath55 with the relativistic nucleon isospinor field @xmath56 and @xmath57 being a string of general nucleon - nucleon transition matrices @xmath58 of increasing chiral power @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "for example , to leading order one obtains the well - known structure @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the chiral covariant derivative .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 corresponds to the axial vector coupling constant ( in the chiral limit ) and the chiral tensor @xmath63 describes the coupling of an odd number of pions with nucleon . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the second step is a redefinition of the relativistic nucleon fields via @xmath64 with the velocity - dependent projection operators @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath25 is typically called the `` light '' field , whereas @xmath66 is commonly referred to as the `` heavy '' field .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian eq.([eq : rellag ] ) then takes the general form @xmath67 where the matrices @xmath68 are defined via @xmath69 we note that each matrix consists of an infinite string of terms of increasing chiral power @xmath59 , analogous to eq.([eq : gamma ] ) start with chiral power @xmath70 , while @xmath71 begins with @xmath72 .",
    "this appearance of a large mass term @xmath73 in @xmath71 is also the reason why the @xmath66 fields are denoted `` heavy '' and ultimately get integrated out . ] .",
    "now one shifts the fields and integrates out the heavy component @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting ( non - relativistic ) effective lagrangian reads @xmath74 for the case of su(2 ) the explicit form of this effective lagrangian for spin 1/2 nucleons has been worked out up to @xmath75 by several groups ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . generalizations to even higher orders are under way @xcite .",
    "the important point to note is that the inverse of matrix @xmath76 is calculated perturbatively , which confines the resulting effective lagrangian to the non - relativistic regime .",
    "hbchpt as described above , has been quite successful for scattering processes off a single nucleon near threshold ( for reviews see @xcite ) . at higher energies , however , the contribution from nucleon resonances like @xmath2(1232 )",
    "can no longer be parameterized via higher order nucleon - nucleon couplings in @xmath77 , etc . at some point",
    ", i.e. once explicit propagation of a nucleon- or meson - resonance has to be included , the above described contact interaction approach breaks down .",
    "so if one is interested in kinematic conditions of such dynamic resonance contributions , or in investigations into the low energy structure of nucleon resonances , it becomes mandatory to include low lying resonances as explicit degrees of freedom in the effective lagrangian eq.([eq : leff ] ) .",
    "in particular this means the inclusion of the spin 3/2 nucleon resonance @xmath2(1232 ) in the case of an su(2 ) analysis .",
    "the first efforts towards this direction were performed by jenkins and manohar @xcite . in the present work , however , we follow a specific generalization of the construction method of ref.@xcite ( as outlined above ) , which is called the `` small scale expansion '' ( _ sse _ ) @xcite .",
    "the main difference to hbchpt lies in the fact that _ the chiral power counting is modified in a phenomenologically inspired fashion_. in the _ sse _ approach one expands in the small scale @xmath78 , where @xmath79 corresponds to the delta - nucleon mass splitting in the chiral limit , whereas in hbchpt one expands in the quantity @xmath80 counts as a quantity of order @xmath81 .",
    "this is formally correct but can lead to poor convergence properties in the perturbation series . for more details",
    "we refer to the discussion in @xcite regarding the spin - polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "the chiral power counting of hbchpt as an expansion of all quantities in a power series governed by @xmath82 is taken over by _ sse _ as an expansion of all quantities in a power series governed by @xmath83 . in the following",
    "we only briefly discuss the construction of the relevant su(2 ) lagrangians with explicit pion , nucleon and delta degrees of freedom and their couplings to arbitrary external fields .",
    "for details we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "the starting point this time is a set of coupled relativistic su(2 ) lagrangians of relativistic nucleon and delta fields @xmath84 @xmath85 where each baryon matrix @xmath86 is a string of terms of increasing power in @xmath83 , analogous to eq.([eq : gamma ] ) . for the spin 3/2 , isospin 3/2 delta field we utilize a rarita - schwinger - isospurion notation , as laid out in the appendices of ref.@xcite . in the rarita - schwinger formulation for spin 3/2 fields one encounters the well - known redundancy of degrees of freedom , which calls for six projection operators before one is able to isolate the",

    "the main features of our investigation can be summarized as follows :    * the @xmath0 amplitude has been calculated to @xmath127 in the `` small scale expansion '' formalism .",
    "the pertinent counterterm contributions , relevant 1/m corrections to lower order coupling and all loop diagrams allowed to this order have been analyzed systematically . it was found that the @xmath3-dependence of the transition is generated by two @xmath310loop diagrams and that two counterterms are needed to renormalize the result . * we have obtained an estimate for presently poorly known couplings from existing phenomenological analyses and then given predictions for the complex transition multipoles @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 as well as the complex multipole ratios cmr(0 ) , emr(@xmath3 ) , cmr(@xmath3 ) . while matching the @xmath127 results to the corresponding expressions of the multipoles as functions of @xmath3 we found that the radii of the quadrupole form factors are not suppressed by a large scale compared to the @xmath164 point , indicating a possibly rapid variation at low @xmath3 .",
    "further study of this interesting result will continue once more precise information on the necessary couplings is available . * three appropriately defined electromagnetic @xmath16 transition form factors @xmath314 have been identified from the @xmath127 @xmath0 calculation .",

    "the three @xmath215 form factors are found to be complex quantities due to the @xmath4-loop diagram ( i ) in fig.1 .",
    "their entire @xmath3dependence is controlled by relatively well - known @xmath115 parameters  making the @xmath215 form factors the prefered testing ground of chiral symmetry in the radiative @xmath16-transition .",
    "the corresponding slope parameters have been calculated and their chiral limit behavior has been discussed .",
    "the numerical results of this work have to be considered preliminary due to the presently poor state of knowledge on coupling constants in the sse formalism .",
