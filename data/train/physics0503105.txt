    "pareto power law @xcite in wealth distribution has become a hot topic nowadays . since last decade",
    "physicists are putting a lot of efforts to study economic market through suitable models @xcite .",
    "they consider economic market as a multi - agent interacting system and try to analyze the market through known tools of statistical physics although in reality the economic market is much more complex and the agents are inherently different from each other  so can not be hoped to behave similarly . to start with",
    ", a closed economy market has been considered having some money exchange interaction the main intention is to find out the distribution of wealth ( money ) among the agents and to search for a suitable exchange interaction which can produce pareto like power law distribution of wealth .",
    "the molecules in an ideal gas interact freely and the kinetic theory finds the energy distribution among the molecules .",
    "if the agents of model market exchange their money through such free interactions that market is called a random trading market @xcite .",
    "two types of basic random trading are possible :      two interacting agents ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) put all their money ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) together",
    ". then one agent takes a random part of the total money and rest money goes to other agent .",
    "@xmath4    @xmath5 ; @xmath6    with @xmath7    here agents do not save anything and put all their money for trading .",
    "this type of trading rule results @xcite gibbs distribution of the money distribution in the market at steady state having the form :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the average money ( total money / total agent ) of the market .",
    "clearly this distribution is similar to the energy distribution within the molecules of ideal gas .",
    "if the agents do save some portions ( fixed or random ) of their money then the total money available for random trading gets reduced .",
    "we can write the general money exchange rule for two agents having money @xmath2 and @xmath3 and saving factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively :    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14 ; @xmath6    for fixed saving factor ( @xmath15 ) we get a most probable type money distribution @xcite and for random saving factor ( @xmath16 ) the money distribution shows @xcite pareto power law with exponent @xmath17",
    ".      another type of trading may occur @xcite when two interacting agents put same amount of money for random exchange i.e , the richer agent put an amount just equal to that of the poor agent .",
    "then as before one agent takes a random part of the total money ( available for trading ) and rest money goes to other agent .",
    "@xmath4    if @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20 ; @xmath6    if @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23 ; @xmath24    we can generalize the above scheme for two agents ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with saving factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 as    @xmath12 ;    if @xmath18    @xmath25    @xmath14 ; @xmath6    if @xmath21    @xmath26    @xmath27 ; @xmath24",
    "\\1 ) the random exchange in type - i trading market creates ` * * _ insecurity _ * * ' problem . here",
    "richer agents put more money ( beyond saving ) to trade with poor agents even with agents having no money .",
    "therefore the richer agent always finds greater probability to loose than to gain from an exchange interaction .",
    "it may happen that the richer agent looses all his money in one interaction .",
    "thus type - i trading favors the poor agents and it is really a nightmare to the richer agents .",
    ".2 in    \\2 ) type - i trading shows pareto power law when the agents have random saving factor drawn from an interval @xmath16 .",
    "but there is one important restriction that the interval has to includes the value @xmath28 ( or very nearly @xmath28 ) .",
    "if we take an interval @xmath29 -there will not be any robust power law that means some agents with very high saving factor have to be present in the market who always gain money from the interactions and do not loose . therefore to achieve pareto power law",
    "this model pre - assigned some agents as permanent gainer which weakens the model itself .",
    "although type - ii trading seems realistic , it has a basic problem that it gradually tends toward ` * * _ monopoly _ * * ' market where all money goes to a single agent making all others simply beggar .",
    "this happens because when one agent losses all his money he can not take part in further money exchange as he does not afford some money for trade .",
    "thus the agents having ` zero ' money remain ` outcast ' from the society and their number increases as the interactions go on .",
    "we propose a * ` sensible trading ' * scheme among the agents to avoid the aforesaid drawbacks .",
    "this is a mixture of type - i and type - ii trading : interactions follow type - ii trading with a probability @xmath30 and obey type - i trading with probability ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus the general money exchange scheme for this ` sensible ' trading appears as :    @xmath4    for @xmath32    @xmath13    @xmath14 ; @xmath6    for @xmath33    if @xmath18    @xmath25    @xmath14 ; @xmath6    if @xmath21    @xmath26    @xmath27 ; @xmath24    here @xmath34 is a random number uniformly distributed between @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "clearly when @xmath36 only type - i trading is possible and when @xmath37 we will have type - ii trading only . therefore we can reproduce type - i and type - ii tradings correctly from this generalized ` sensible trading ' scheme . the behavior of this scheme becomes interesting when @xmath30 value lies in between the above extremes so that both type - i and type - ii tradings play their role .",
    "we call it a ` sensible market ' where type - ii trading dominates much over type - i trading because type - ii has no extra risk .",
    "we observe that for @xmath38 -the market seems to approach toward ` monopoly trend ' and for @xmath39 type - i trading dominates resulting gibbs - like free - market .",
    "therefore we keep @xmath30 values in the range @xmath40 to have a ` sensible market ' .",
    ".2 in    let us discuss how does this scheme overcome the drawbacks :    .1 in    \\1 ) here the richer agents feel secured as in most of the cases they apt type - ii trading with poor agents and there is no risk to loose more .",
    "\\2 ) if some agents loose all their money still they can interact with others through type - i trading ( with @xmath31 probability ) and can gain money to become richer .",
    "this resists the ` * * _ monopoly _ * * ' trend and drives the system toward a steady state .",
    ".3 in    now we are going to find ( numerically ) the money distributions following ` * * sensible trading * * ' scheme in different situations .",
    "we choose two @xmath30 values : @xmath41 and @xmath42 to make the market more sensitive . also we choose number of agents @xmath43 and the average money @xmath44 and number of interactions @xmath45 in each case .",
    ".2 in    * fig . 1 : * the dotted straight lines represents power laws with exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the curved dotted line is the plot of @xmath48 .",
    "averages are taken over @xmath49 samples .",
    ".2 in    without any saving factor the ` sensible ' market shows two power laws and demands that the poor agents and the richer agents obey different power law behavior .",
    "the deviation of the distribution function from the free market ( gibbs law ) is prominent .",
    ".1 in    .2 in    * fig .",
    "2 : * the dotted straight line in first plot represents @xmath48 and in second plot presents power laws with exponents @xmath51 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "averages are taken over @xmath52 samples .",
    ".2 in    in gibbs like free market constant saving factor results most probable type distribution .",
    "but in the sensible market we observe that for low saving factor the distributions almost follow exponential laws and this exponential behavior deviates ( some power laws appear ) as we increase @xmath30 values . on the other hand for high saving factor the most probable type distributions appear .",
    ".2 in    .2 in    * fig . 3 : * in the first plot we take @xmath16 and in second and third plot that range has been reduced to @xmath29 .",
    "the dotted lines represent power laws having different exponents : in first plot @xmath46 and @xmath17 , in second plot @xmath53 and in third plot @xmath46 and @xmath54 .",
    "averages are taken over @xmath52 samples .",
    ".2 in    for random saving case we find two distinct power laws when the random factor is chosen from the interval @xmath16 .",
    "also the market shows power law distribution with reduced range of random factor ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath30 value increases .",
    "a free market ( type - i trading ) basically runs through _ ` gambling ' _ and a restricted market ( type - ii trading ) gradually becomes a ` _ _ monopoly _ _ ' market .",
    "but a careful mixing of type - i and type - ii trading can produce a much realistic model of closed market .",
    "such a market shows power law behavior in terms of wealth ( money ) distribution within agents for different situations of money exchange therefore potentially advanced .    1 v. pareto , _ cours deconomic politique",
