    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a procedure of information exchange between two parties , the sender alice and the receiver bob , which allows to distribute absolutely secure data between them @xcite .",
    "the distinctive part of qkd with respect to classical communication is the use of a quantum information channel , where the signal is protected from unauthorized duplication @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the information signal can be described by discrete variables ( dv ) or by continuous variables ( cv ) @xcite , although physically the signal can be of various kinds : single photons @xcite , weak coherent pulses @xcite , squeezed states @xcite and other systems where a signal possesses essentially quantum properties .",
    "a universal characteristic that can be compared for different qkd protocols ( apart from their experimental realizations ) is the secret key generation rate ( shortly , _ key rate _ )   i.e. the average amount of secure information per elementary transmission ( e.g. per light pulse ) . in order to transmit higher total amount of secure data",
    "one can increase the pulse repetition rate or increase the key rate .",
    "the first way is limited mainly by experimental techniques , while the second one is defined by mathematical properties of the given qkd protocol .    in the case of dv qkd",
    ", it has been shown that extensions of the standard four ",
    "letter bb84 protocol @xcite to higher number of letters in the alphabet can improve performance in terms of higher critical error rate or longer communication lines @xcite .    in the case of cv qkd ,",
    "the first protocols were based on gaussian alphabets consisting of either coherent or squeezed states .",
    "the common weak point of these protocols is high sensitivity to losses in the quantum communication channel , which initially was believed to lead to the so  called `` 3 db loss limit '' : the key rate is equal to zero when channel losses are higher than @xmath0 . after the invention of postselection @xcite and reverse reconciliation @xcite , this limit was overcome , and the key rate was substantially improved .",
    "another interesting option for improving the key rate is to consider discrete alphabets @xcite instead of gaussian ones .",
    "protocols with gaussian alphabets have an advantage of simpler security analysis , whilst the protocols based on discrete modulation are easier to realize in practice .    in this work",
    "we address the question how one can further increase the key rate of cv qkd with discrete modulation by varying the geometry of the quantum alphabet .",
    "having in mind the idea of improving the properties of dv qkd by use of more symmetric alphabets with higher number of letters @xcite , we present a new cv qkd protocol which generalizes previous ones with discrete modulation @xcite .",
    "namely , the protocol employs an alphabet with @xmath1 coherent states @xmath2 which have relative phases @xmath3 and a fixed amplitude @xmath4 . in classical communication , this type of encoding is known as phase  shift  keying ( psk ) .",
    "we perform a security analysis of the proposed protocol for lossy but noiseless quantum channels , providing full optimization of all parameters of the protocol , and show how the number of letters affects the key rate .",
    "an elementary information transmission in the multi letter psk protocol is as follows :    * the sender ( alice ) chooses a random equiprobable number @xmath5 and sends the respective coherent state @xmath6 . * the receiver ( bob ) measures the state by splitting the signal at a 50/50 beam splitter and measuring two conjugate quadratures @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the output ports by homodyning each signal   such a scheme is called heterodyne measurement @xcite , where the two conjugate measurements can be separated in time or space .",
    "the results of the measurements are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which we write as a pure coherent state @xmath11 .",
    "* bob assigns a classical number @xmath12 to the measured state @xmath13 by finding a state @xmath14 which is the closest alphabet s state to the state @xmath13 : @xmath15 . generally speaking",
    ", this classical value @xmath12 decoded by bob can be different from the initial value @xmath16 sent by alice because of intrinsic quantum uncertainty even in the absence of eavesdropping or any channel noise .",
    "the elementary information transmission from alice to bob can be schematically shown as a `` @xmath17 '' channel : @xmath18    as long as the considered quantum alphabet has a regular @xmath19 phase  shift symmetry , and all states have an equal probability to be sent , all channel inputs and outputs ( [ abflow ] ) are equiprobable .",
    "we note , that there is no active choice of measurement basis in our protocol , therefore there is no basis reconciliation needed .",
    "all transmissions contribute to the total secure key , and nothing is discarded unlike in previous protocols with discrete modulation and homodyne detection @xcite .    after the measurement , bob can ( but not necessarily has to ) use the postselection idea @xcite , when he decides whether to keep the transmission depending on the value @xmath20 .",
    "the elementary transmission ( [ abflow ] ) , possibly followed by postselection , is repeated until alice and bob collect enough data to perform classical error correction and privacy amplification procedures @xcite .",
    "the resulting data is a secret key .    the amplitude @xmath4 and the number of letters @xmath1 can be flexibly adjusted for a given information channel .",
    "the exact optimization for a given channel transmittance will be discussed later .",
    "these parameters are supposed to be publicly known , particularly by the potential eavesdropper .",
    "we note that the number of states can be arbitrary large . in the limit of infinity @xmath21",
    "we have a continuous phase modulation .",
    "thus our protocol can be viewed as a smooth transition between discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite modulation of cv .",
    "we investigate the security of our protocol assuming there is no excess noise in the quantum channel . in this case",
    "the best possible attack is the beam splitting attack @xcite .",
    "we allow eve to have unlimited access to all the losses , as she could replace the real lossy information channel with an ideal lossless one .",
    "the beam splitting transformation is @xmath22 , where alice s initial state @xmath23 is split to bob s state @xmath24 and eve s state @xmath25 : @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the channel transmittance .    in this beam splitting scenario",
    ", eve does not introduce any excess noise on bob s side , whereas in any other better eavesdropping strategy eve necessarily does .",
    "for example , if eve would make an intercept  resend attack , then she adds at least one unit of shot noise .",
    "afterwards , she can attenuate the signal , and the excess noise will be proportionally reduced . as a remark on the side ,",
    "we see in this way , that the maximum tolerable excess noise can not exceed that of the intercept  resend strategy , i.e. can not be higher then channel transmittance @xmath27 .    in real communication lines , such as optical fibres or free space , excess noise ( typically , about @xmath28 of shot noise @xcite ) is introduced mainly by imperfections of the experimental setup , and there is almost no measurable excess noise due to the channel itself .",
    "if the absence of channel excess noise is experimentally verified , then the eavesdropping strategy based on beam splitting is the best possible attack , at least for the values of the channel transmittance @xmath29 .",
    "the amount of classical mutual shannon information @xmath30 transmitted from alice to bob via the channel ( [ abflow ] ) is equal to the difference of _ a priori _ ( before measurement ) and _ a posteriori _ ( after measurement ) entropies @xcite . before any measurement ,",
    "all channel outcomes are equiprobable for bob , so his _ a priori _ entropy @xmath31 is the unconditional `` pure guess '' entropy equal to @xmath32 bit per transmission .",
    "the conditional probability density to measure the state @xmath13 when a state @xmath23 has been sent is @xmath33 the total unconditional probability density to measure a state @xmath13 is @xmath34 .",
    "its normalization @xmath35 also yields the normalization of @xmath36    after the measurement of @xmath13 , the probability @xmath37 that the state @xmath14 was initially sent is @xmath38 as we discussed above , the measured state @xmath13 is decoded by bob to a classical value @xmath12 such that the state @xmath14 is the closest alphabet s state to the measured state @xmath13 .",
    "corresponding regions in the phase space are shown by different shades of grey in fig .",

    "we also assume , that after the beam splitting eve is not restricted to any practical way of information extraction from this state , thus her potential knowledge is bounded by the holevo information @xcite . in the general case",
    ", the holevo information @xmath46 sets the upper bound on the information which can be transmitted by a state randomly chosen from a set of @xmath1 states @xmath47 with a respective probability @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the von neumann entropy @xmath51 .",
    "in the direct reconciliation case , eve has a state ( [ bestates ] ) conditioned only on alice s sent state @xmath23 .",
    "eve s conditional state is pure , thus her information is equal to the von neumann entropy @xmath52 of her unconditional state @xmath53 .    to calculate @xmath54 we need to find the eigenvalues of @xmath55",
    "the rotational symmetry of the phase ",
    "shift alphabet allows us to write eve s conditional states in an orthogonal basis @xmath56 as @xcite : @xmath57    in the basis @xmath56 eve s unconditional state takes the diagonal form : @xmath58 so eve s information is equal to @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 $ ] is the shannon entropy @xmath61 of the probability distribution @xmath62 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath63 are derived from a system of @xmath1 linear equations enumerated by an index @xmath5 : @xmath64 it has a formal analytical solution @xmath65 where the coefficients @xmath66 depend on the signal amplitude @xmath4 and the channel transmittance @xmath27 .      in the case of reverse reconciliation eve",
    "has a state ( [ bestates ] ) conditioned on bob s measured state @xmath13 .",
    "after classical communication eve can possibly find out the amount of information ( [ iab ] ) between alice and bob in each transmission , so we assume this value is publicly open .",
    "additionally we assume that bob announces the amplitude of the measured state , so eve knows the measured state @xmath13 up to a cyclic phase shift @xmath19 .",
    "we denote these possible states as @xmath67 . on her side",
    ", eve has to distinguish between the states @xmath68 .    after averaging ,",
    "eve s state is @xmath69 , so the left entropy term in ( [ holevo ] ) is the same as we calculated before for the case of direct reconciliation . due to the @xmath19 phase",
    " shift symmetry of the alphabet , the averaging in the right entropy term in ( [ holevo ] ) is just equal to the entropy of any of the states @xmath70 , let it be the first one @xmath71 .",
    "again , we can rewrite eve s states @xmath25 in the orthogonal basis ( [ evestates ] ) . unfortunately",
    ", the state @xmath71 in this basis takes a non  diagonal form @xmath72 .",
    "we analytically calculate eigenvalues of this state for a given @xmath1 , but the result is too large to be presented here .",
    "finally , eve s information is @xmath73-s[\\hat\\rho_{e}^{(1)}]$ ] .      the key rate @xmath74 , i.e. the amount of secret information per transmission ( [ abflow ] ) , is equal to the difference between bob s and eve s informations @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 refer to direct and reverse reconciliation respectively .",
    "are associated with a given letter .",
    "letters are shown as black circles .",
    "dashed lines show the borders of the postselection areas for a case when amplitude is @xmath78 , and transmittance varies from @xmath79 ( the smallest area ) to @xmath80 ( the biggest area ) with a step @xmath81.,width=226 ]    in the case of direct reconciliation , eve has to guess what was sent by alice .",
    "if the channel transmittance is lower than @xmath0 , eve can potentially have a better signal than bob , thus eve s information can be higher than bob s information and no secure communication is possible . to overcome this `` 3 db limit '' we use the postselection idea @xcite , so",
    "that bob has an information advantage over eve ( @xmath82 ) , i.e. we select only that part of transmissions which give us positive terms @xmath83 .",
    "the postselection procedure in the direct reconciliation scenario can be qualitatively described as follows : eve s information @xmath76 does not depend on bob s measured state @xmath20 , so the key rate can be increased if bob accepts only those transmissions where @xmath20 is such that he has higher information than eve ( @xmath84 ) . instead of integration over the whole phase space ( [ g ] ) we have integration over the postselected area ( psa ) : @xmath85    to find this psa we numerically solve an equation @xmath84 . as an example in fig .",
    "[ 5lett ] we show the borders of the psa for 5 letter protocol as the dashed lines .",
    "different dashed lines correspond to different values of transmittance @xmath86 , and the amplitude is fixed @xmath78 .",
    "the psa is the phase space except the central region bounded by a dashed line .",
    "if the measured state @xmath13 lies inside the region the transmission should be omitted , otherwise it is accepted .",
    "the higher the transmittance , the smaller the omitted region , the bigger the psa , and the higher the key rate ( [ gps ] ) .    to find the key rate @xmath87 as a function of transmittance @xmath27 we optimize the amplitude @xmath4 such as to maximize the key rate @xmath88 .",
    "in the case of reverse reconciliation , eve has to guess bob s measurement result , thus her information can not be higher than bob s information : @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 is always nonnegative , and the postselection procedure does not have to be applied .",
    "the calculated secret key rate @xmath90 and the optimal amplitude @xmath91 for several alphabets are shown in fig .  [ gaeta ] for the 5letter alphabet is not a mistake . due to the fact that the function @xmath92 at a fixed value @xmath27 can have two slightly different global maxima , the exact optimization for variable @xmath27 may cause a `` jump '' from one maximum to another . ] .",
    "we can see , that for the channel transmittance @xmath93 all the curves of the key rate are almost the same when the number of letters is more than 4 .     in logarithmic scale ( upper plot ) and optimal signal amplitude ( bottom plot ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to direct and reverse reconciliation , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]   in logarithmic scale ( upper plot ) and optimal signal amplitude ( bottom plot ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to direct and reverse reconciliation , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    in the case of reverse reconciliation we have an interesting result : the higher the number of letters , the higher the key rate .",
    "we do nt have an analytical expression for the @xmath94letter alphabet , but its approximation by a high number of letter confirms that this is the best choice for all values of @xmath27 . the key rate is higher than for the 2letter alphabet of almost an order of magnitude .    in the case of direct reconciliation , we can see that lines @xmath95 for various numbers of letters are intersecting in different points , which are presented in table  [ etatab ] .",
    "this means that for different values of transmittance @xmath27 there are different optimal numbers of letters .",
    "the higher the transmittance , the higher the optimal number of states .    .values of transmittance @xmath27 , where a curve @xmath96 intersects with a curve @xmath97 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ etatab ]    again , we do nt have have an analytical expression for the curve @xmath98 , but we found that left side of the curves quickly saturates ( there is no essential difference between @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath93 ) .",
    "so we can conjecture , that the optimal alphabets can consist of 2 , 3 , 4 , or @xmath94 letters . a curve @xmath98 intersects with @xmath101 at the value @xmath102 , so the most significant advantage of the multi letter protocol over the two letter protocol one can get in the case of high transmittance .",
    "the intuitive explanation is as follows :    in the case of high losses , eve has a stronger signal than bob .",
    "thus the amplitude of the signal @xmath103 must be small , and bob relies basically on the postselection .",
    "in postselection it is harder for bob to distinguish between many letters than between two .",
    "thus with an increasing number of letters his information essentially decreases . in this case",
    "the alphabet with two letters outperforms the multi letter alphabet .    in the opposite case of low losses",
    "eve has a weaker signal , and alice can increase the amplitude of the signal and number of letters . with higher amplitude of the signal bob can better distinguish between many letters and increase his information . in the limit",
    "@xmath104 alice can use signals with high amplitude and bob can get almost @xmath32 bit per transmission .",
    "therefore , the more letters in the alphabet are , the higher bob s information is . in principle",
    ", one can use an arbitrary high number of letters , and in the limit @xmath21 ( continuous phase modulation ) bob s information seems to be infinite .",
    "however , there are limiting factors from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints .",
    "first , as one can see in fig",
    ".  [ gaeta ] the curves @xmath95 and @xmath91 start to essentially increase from the values @xmath105 . in any real experimental setup",
    "there are imperfections ( inaccuracy , losses , etc . ) , so the case @xmath105 can hardly be achieved .",
    "second , any real signal has certain energy limit , which sets maximum amplitude . also taking into account excess noise in the channel might somewhat change the situation .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a new cv qkd protocol with coherent states .",
    "the protocol employs multi letter phase  shift  keying and heterodyne measurement .",
    "security analysis of the proposed protocol is performed for the case of lossy but noiseless quantum channels .",
    "we have shown that for each given channel transmittance one can find a certain optimal number of letters ( 2 , 3 , 4 , or @xmath94 ) , optimal amplitude of the signal ( typically , 1 to 4 photons per pulse ) , and optimal postselection threshold , which increase the secret key rate about one order of magnitude comparing to the protocol with binary modulation .",
