    "the distribution of galaxy morphology in the local universe contains the imprints of the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , the fact that galaxy morphology correlates with physical parameters ( such as optical size , luminosity , surface brightness , total stellar / gas  mass , etc . ) implies that the stages of the morphological sequence are intertwined with the assembly of the galaxies stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "locally , galaxies are classifiable in terms of the well  known `` hubble sequence '' , which seems to apply even to moderately high redshifts ( @xmath3 ; schade et al .",
    "1995 ; lilly et al .",
    "1998 ; dickinson 1999 ; simard et al.1999 ; van den bergh , cohen , & crabbe 2001 ) . at still higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , galaxies appear to undergo a transformation .",
    "galaxies at these epochs are observed to have highly irregular , or centrally compact morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the hubble sequence seems to no longer apply @xcite .",
    "however , galaxy morphological classification has been calibrated by their appearances at rest ",

    ", one must comprehend how the appearance of galaxies at rest ",
    "frame ultraviolet ( uv)to  optical wavelengths relates to the processes of galaxy evolution .",
    "the degree to which the observed rest  frame uv morphology of a galaxy corresponds to that in the rest ",
    "frame optical is a function of galaxy spectral type .",
    "recent work has broadly concluded that a galaxy appears as a later  type system when observed in the uv relative to the optical ( i.e. , the morphological @xmath1correction ; see bohlin et al .",

    "this effect is attributed to the fact that the rest  frame far  uv ( fuv , @xmath5   ) light stems primarily from the young o and b  type stars , whereas stars of later type ( a  type and later ) contribute increasingly at mid  uv ( muv , @xmath6   ) and redder wavelengths . because bright ,",
    "early  type stars have short relative lifespans , fuv observations are generally sensitive to recent star formation events , while longer  lived , later ",
    "type stars trace past star  formation episodes , now only evidenced by an older stellar population .",
    "young , bright ob  star complexes tend to dominate the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at uv  to  optical wavelengths in late  type spiral and irregular galaxies that are actively forming stars . as such , the morphological appearances of these galaxies exhibit only a weak ( or nonexistent ) dependence on uv / optical wavelength .",
    "conversely , the morphological @xmath1correction can be much more pronounced in early  to  mid - type spirals .",
    "older stars dominate the optical portion of the sed in these galaxies , and the uv emission originates in rather sparse regions of ongoing star  formation , normally confined to the spiral arms . when observed at uv wavelengths , light from the older stars disappears and the galaxy takes on the appearance of a later  type system .",
    "lastly , it is noteworthy that elliptical and lenticular galaxies usually exhibit weak morphological @xmath1corrections .",
    "the distribution of stellar populations in these systems is generally very homogeneous .",
    "these galaxies typically have low specific star  formation rates ( i.e. , star  formation rate per unit stellar mass ) , and any uv emission in present ",
    "day early  type galaxies usually stems from late evolutionary stages of late  type stars that are well mixed with the underlying stellar populations ( dorman et al.1995 ; converted to the ab magnitude system , see   [ section : data ] ) , which is much weaker than the values for star  forming galaxies .",

    "however , studying this evolution as a function of redshift is hampered due to effects arising from the morphological @xmath1correction .",
    "for example , @xcite artificially redshifted local galaxies , spanning a range of hubble type using fuv images from the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( _ uit _ ) , and demonstrated that these broadly reproduce the observed morphology of the faint galaxies in optical images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , giavalisco et al .  suggested that dynamical evolution may only have played a minor role in the galaxies evolutionary histories and argued caution when interpreting the faint ",
    "galaxy population in the context of galaxy  evolution scenarios .",
    "these conclusions have been elaborated upon by @xcite , who preformed very detailed simulations of artificially redshifting _",
    "uit_/fuv images of a larger sample of local galaxies into the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 data for the hubble deep field north ( hdf  n ; * ? ? ?",
    "kuchinski et al .",
    "concluded that effects arising from bandshifting dominate the morphological @xmath1correction , and surface  brightness dimming induces small ( but non - negligible ) , seemingly random changes into quantitative morphological parameters .",
    "thus , comparing the rest ",
    "frame uv morphologies of the high  redshift galaxy population to those in optical images of local galaxies does not likely provide a homologous comparison sample .",
    "additional insights  beyond those possible from single  band morphology studies  can be obtained by investigating the distribution and morphology of internal colors and color gradients within individual galaxies . in a novel study , @xcite showed that the color gradients observed in local spiral galaxies are likely the result of a combination of stellar age and metallicity effects , with the outer disk regions being bluer and having lower metallicity . @xcite and menanteau et al .",
    "( 2001 ) investigated the internal colors of galaxies in the hdf ",
    "n and hdf  s using the _ hst _  wfpc2 four  color data to study variations in the star  formation histories of field galaxies .",
    "for example , menanteau et al .  observed a significant fraction of galaxies in the field population with strong internal color variations , which they interpreted as evidence for recent star formation and argued that ( field ) elliptical and bulge  dominated galaxies have continued to assemble their stellar populations since @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , elliptical galaxies in rich clusters exhibit relatively lower internal color variation , which argues that color variations in early  type galaxies have a strong environmental dependence , where evolution is accelerated in the densest environments ( i.e. , enhanced star formation at earlier epochs ) .",
    "the broad conclusion from these studies is that the synthesis of galaxy internal colors provides insights into the spatial distribution of the underlying stellar populations , and thus into the processes of star formation in the galaxies ( see also , * ? ? ?",

    ", we develop a statistic to measure the morphological difference between galaxy images in two bandpasses .",
    "as reviewed above , the wavelength dependence of morphology has often been previously described in qualitative terms . here",
    ", we aim to provide a simple , _ quantitative _ measure of morphological difference between images at different wavelengths that can be applied , for example , to _ hst _  images of distant galaxies .",
    "our statistic quantifies the amplitude of the morphological differences or the variations in internal galaxy colors , without describing the spatial organization of those variations .",
    "some other measurements , such as color gradients ( see references above ) , emphasize the organization of color differences .",
    "ours is , in a sense , cruder than a structural quantity like a color gradient , but it can be measured in a simple , automated , and model independent fashion , and provides a straightforward measure of the degree to which stellar  population or extinction variations within a galaxy affect the relative morphologies seen at two wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , because our statistic is integrated over a whole galaxy , it is robustly measurable for even faint , distant galaxies with relatively low , signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "here , we focus on the internal color dispersion for a sample of local galaxies using _ uit_/uv and ground  based optical data , and compare this to their morphological features and integrated properties . in a forthcoming paper ( papovich et al . , 2003 ;",
    "paper ii ) , we apply this diagnostic to samples of high  redshift galaxies at @xmath7 and @xmath8 using the _ hst _  uv  to  near - infrared data for the hdf ",
    "an advantage of using the _ uit _  and @xmath0band data for the local galaxy sample is that they probe nearly equal rest ",
    "frame wavelengths as the _ hst _  data available for the high  redshift hdf ",
    "n  galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can use the results here as a baseline for interpretation of the processes affecting the observations of the higher redshift galaxies .",
    "it is useful at this point to postulate various properties that could produce or suppress a galaxy s internal color dispersion . because we focus on uv / optical wavelengths",
    ", we expect that the internal color dispersion should be sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity in the relative composition and spatial distribution of a galaxy s young and more aged stars .",
    "small values of the internal color dispersion could indicate several scenarios .",
    "for example , all stars in a galaxy could be old ( with little uv emission ) , with small scatter in their ages and colors .",
    "alternatively , either a coeval stellar population could dominate the light for all uv / optical wavelengths , or the galaxy could contain a mixed  aged stellar population with a homogeneous distribution , e.g. , the stars could be well  mixed following a merger event , or after several dynamical timescales within a galactic disk .",
    "these scenarios likely apply to ellipticals , lenticulars , and early  type spirals , and thus one may expect these types of objects to exhibit low internal color dispersion .",
    "small dispersion in a galaxy s internal colors could also signify that a substantial young stellar population with fairly uniform colors dominates the uv / optical galaxy colors , with the light from other ( older ) stellar populations lost in the `` glare '' of the nascent stars .",
    "this case is arguably relevant for late  type irregular and starbursting galaxies .",
    "conversely , a large internal color dispersion in these colors probably requires both a range of stellar population ages ( or a highly inhomogeneous distribution of dust extinction ) and spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "this description plausibly predicts that mid  type spirals  with non  coeval stellar populations in the bulge / disk / spiral  arm components  should display the greatest internal uv / optical  color dispersion .",
    "therefore , our definition of a galaxy s internal color dispersion has the potential to quantify the prominence of these morphological features , and should vary as a function of morphological type .    the outline for the remainder of this article is as follows . in  2 , we discuss the data used and the selection of the sample of local galaxies . in  3 , we introduce the internal color dispersion statistic and demonstrate its robustness against changes in object signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we then discuss the application of this measure to the local galaxy sample . in  4 , we compare the measured internal color dispersion values to other galaxy properties to investigate those processes to which this metric is sensitive . in  5",
    ", we discuss the application of this diagnostic to high  redshift galaxy populations by artificially redshifting galaxies from the local sample and inserting them into deep _ hst _",
    "finally , in  6 , we present a summary of this work . unless otherwise specified , all magnitudes in this paper are presented on the ab system @xcite , where @xmath9",

    "constant  dominated world model , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and a hubble constant of @xmath12  .",
    "we have selected nearby galaxies for which there exist archival imaging available at fuv , muv , and optical ( i.e. , @xmath0band ) wavelengths .",
    "the fuv and muv data used here were collected by the _ uit _  aboard the  space  shuttle mission in 1990 .",
    "the _ uit _  mission included two cameras sensitive to a combined wavelength range roughly @xmath13    ( see stecher et al .",

    "the _ uit _  instrument was flown on a second shuttle mission in 1995 , , but the muv camera failed to activate on orbit .",
    "thus , only fuv data is available from the later mission . to augment the available fuv and muv data from the mission , we have made use of publicly available ground  based optical images obtained in support of the _ uit _  mission by @xcite from telescopes at the kitt peak national observatory , cerro tololo inter ",

    "this seems to be the case for the latest morphological types .",
    "note that this does not exclude the possibility that older stars exist beneath the glare of the young stellar populations , simply that any hypothetical old population does not contribute substantially to the internal color dispersion or total colors .",
    "galaxies in the sample with intermediate uv  to  optical colors ( i.e. , @xmath166 ) exhibit the largest range of internal color dispersion values , which is illustrated by the `` swath '' of @xmath70 values that span @xmath167 in the left panel of figure  [ fig : zetavnuvcolor ] .",
    "one can consider the argument that these uv  to  optical colors may be in some sense a requirement for the existence of high internal color dispersion .",
    "several possibilities then emerge .",
    "the galaxies must have young stellar populations that dominate the uv emission and are segregated in some manner from a substantial evolved stellar population ( e.g. , a disk / bulge dichotomy ) .",

    "these simulations are crude , and do not include the effects of varying dust opacity , imf , metallicity , or the possibility of more than two stellar populations .",
    "obviously , any factor that contributes to the relative difference in the colors throughout a galaxy will contribute to the overall internal color dispersion .",
    "the results here , however , illustrate how the internal color dispersion depends on the fraction of a galaxies stellar mass in young stellar populations .",
    "an alternative scenario exists to account for the range of internal color dispersion observed at intermediate @xmath36 colors in which the galaxies internal colors result from a variable distribution of dust absorption .",
