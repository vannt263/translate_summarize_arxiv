    "the power spectrum of density fluctuations is an important fundamental quantity of interest for the problem of structure formation in cosmology .",
    "for example , for gaussian density fluctuations , as may arise out of inflationary scenarios for the origin of the universe ( @xcite ) , the power spectrum provides a complete description of the initial fluctuations .",
    "the subsequent development and evolution of structure via gravitational instability , in the context of a dark matter dominated universe and models of biased galaxy formation ( @xcite ) , have received much theoretical attention in the past decade , both analytically and through the use of large numerical n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the observational front ,",
    "the detection of microwave background anisotropies by the cobe dmr experiment ( @xcite ) provided important constraints on the primordial power spectrum on horizon scales .",
    "the clustering of galaxies on smaller scales and the interpretation of the observations to reveal the matter content of the universe , to elucidate the process of structure formation , and to connect to the primordial fluctuations seen by cobe , remain important problems in observational cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "much recent attention has been paid toward determination of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering in a variety of galaxy surveys , including the cfa ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ssrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , iras 1.2 jy ( @xcite ) , iras qdot ( @xcite ) , and apm ( @xcite , 1994 ) surveys . in brief , the power spectra of these surveys have appeared inconsistent with predictions of the `` standard '' biased cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation with @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , while an unbiased @xmath23 model with more large scale power agrees better with the observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "allow us to examine the power spectrum up to wavelengths of @xmath27 mpc , and to provide measurements independent of previous results for the purpose of comparing against cosmological models .",
    "in particular , measurements of the power spectrum on the largest scales @xmath28  mpc are especially interesting , as we expect the power spectrum to peak there and begin its turnover toward the primordial spectrum constrained by cobe and other microwave background observations .",
    "the precise amplitude and shape of the power spectrum on large scales will provide important clues in discriminating among cosmological models .",

    "we briefly describe the main survey parameters .",
    "the survey geometry is that of six @xmath29 `` slices '' ( declination by right ascension ) , three each in the north and south galactic caps . figure  [ figslices ] shows the lcrs galaxy distribution and clearly illustrates the striking pattern of clusters , filaments , walls and voids that is present .",
    "the first 20% of the data was obtained using a 50-object fiber - optic spectrograph , and the remaining 80% of the data was taken with a 112-object system .",
    "the nominal isophotal magnitude limits for the 50-fiber data were @xmath30 ( `` hybrid '' kron - cousins @xmath31 magnitudes ) , and an additional cut was applied which excluded the lowest 20% of galaxies by central surface brightness . for the 112-fiber data , the nominal magnitude limits were @xmath32 , with exclusion of just the lowest 4 - 9% of galaxies by surface brightness .",
    "the survey photometric limits were chosen so that there would be typically more targets per field than available fibers , and we selected targets at random among those that met the selection criteria .",
    "the survey slices were built up by observing @xmath33 fields , one at a time , with a maximum of 50 or 112 galaxies observed per field . because we generally do not re - observe any of our fields , we must keep track of the variable field - to - field sampling fractions @xmath34 in our subsequent statistical analyses . the average sampling fraction is 70% for the 112-fiber data and 58% for the 50-fiber data . also , mechanical constraints prevent two object fibers in a single spectroscopic field from approaching closer than @xmath35 , introducing an additional geometric selection effect",
    ". we will find below that the various sampling , photometric , and geometric selection effects in our survey do not significantly affect the power spectrum results .",
    "in   [ ps : methods ] we detail our power spectrum estimation techniques and verify them on n - body simulations . in   [ pslcg ]",
    "we present the power spectra of magnitude - limited samples of las campanas galaxies , and compare our results to the power spectra derived from other redshift surveys . in   [ lumbias ]",
    "we compute the power spectrum for volume - limited samples of las campanas galaxies and test for luminosity bias in the survey . in ",
    "[ cosmo ] we compare our power spectrum results against those from n - body simulations .",

    "[ ps : conclusions ] .",
    "note that a complementary analysis of the _ 2-dimensional _ lcrs power spectrum has already been carried out ( @xcite ; more on this below ) , and the derivation of the closely - related two - point correlation function of lcrs galaxies is described in tucker ( 1994 ) and tucker et al .",

    "( 1994 ) , and we detail the method below .",
    "the most important difference is that the lcrs consists of six essentially two - dimensional `` slices '' , so that we need to account for `` convolution '' effects caused by the survey geometry in order to calculate the power spectrum properly .",

    "we will use the iterative method due to lucy ( 1974 ) , which has been applied in a similar context by baugh and efstathiou ( 1993 ) to recover the spatial power spectrum from the angular correlation function .",
    "given the observed convolved power @xmath83 at a set of wavenumbers @xmath84 , we can find the true power @xmath85 at the wavenumbers @xmath86 by starting with initial guesses @xmath87 , and then computing new estimates @xmath88 by iteration @xmath89   k(k_i , k_j ) \\delta k}{\\sum_j k(k_i , k_j ) \\delta k}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath90 we also apply a smoothing procedure @xmath91\\ ] ] in order to reduce noise as the @xmath88 converge to a final solution . on the largest scales",
    "@xmath92  mpc@xmath25 , the smoothing also reduces the sensitivity of the solution to the choice of initial guess @xmath87 ( we adopt @xmath93 constant ) .",
    "because the deconvolution procedure is not too well constrained on large scales , and because the smoothing procedure is somewhat arbitrary , we will use the deconvolved power spectra only for qualitative comparisons .",
    "the computation of the convolved power spectrum from a given true power spectrum is more straightforward , and our quantitative analyses will focus on the convolved power spectrum .",
    "we check our power spectrum estimation methods on an n - body simulation kindly provided by changbom park .",
    "the simulation is an open cold dark matter model ( denoted odm ) , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , whose power spectrum has been found to be a good match to that of the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model is unbiased , that is , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the ratio of galaxy to mass density fluctuations .",
    "the model is normalized so that @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the rms galaxy density fluctuation in a sphere of radius 8  @xmath100  mpc .",
    "the odm simulation contains @xmath101 particles and was computed using a particle - mesh code ( @xcite ) on a @xmath102 mesh with corresponding physical comoving volume @xmath103  mpc@xmath104 .",
    "we draw from the odm simulation a set of `` mock '' redshift surveys using the geometric and photometric selection criteria of our actual survey ( see   [ pslcrs ] ) .",
    "the odm `` galaxies '' are assigned absolute magnitudes using the luminosity function derived for the lcrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities of the odm galaxies are included so we measure the power spectrum in redshift space . for each mock survey",
    "we rederive the selection function and then compute the power spectrum using the methods detailed in   [ submethods ] . now , even though the odm simulation box is quite large , the full lcrs still only fits along a body diagonal of the odm box .",
    "we can however fit either the northern or southern halves of the survey into the box fairly readily , and we have drawn a series of northern and southern lcrs mock surveys . to make a reasonably large number of _ whole_-lcrs mock surveys",
    ", we chose to combine a northern and a southern mock survey even though these two mock surveys are not _ originally _ oriented relative to each other in the simulation box as the real northern and southern surveys are . figure  [ figodmsim ] shows the average power spectrum measured from 30 whole - lcrs mock surveys .",
    "we show both the directly measured , or convolved , power , as well as the deconvolved power of the mock surveys .",
    "the errors plotted are the standard deviations of the mean ( sdom ) of the 30 surveys .",
    "also plotted in the figure are the true unconvolved power spectrum of the odm simulation and the odm power spectrum after convolution with our whole - survey window function ( using equations  [ [ eqpconvint ] ] and [ [ eqkerndef ] ] ) .",
    "there is good agreement between the true odm power spectrum and the average power spectrum of the mock surveys over the range of scales @xmath105  mpc that we examine , showing that we can correctly account for the geometry and selection criteria of the lcrs in our measurement and deconvolution of the mock - survey power spectra .",
    "note from figure  [ figodmsim ] that the main effect of the convolution by the window function of our survey is that the convolved power spectrum lies below the unconvolved power spectrum over most of the scales probed .",
    "also , note that on the largest scales , wavelengths @xmath106  mpc , the convolved power spectrum is flat whereas the true power spectrum may peak and begin to turn over .",
    "( this is seen more clearly for the power spectrum of figure  [ fignsfit ] . ) in figure  [ figkernel ] we illustrate the convolution effect in more detail by plotting the integrand @xmath107 of the convolution integral  ( [ eqpconvint ] ) for the odm model at several values of @xmath108 .",
    "this integrand shows the contribution to the convolved power @xmath109 at @xmath108 from the true power @xmath85 at different @xmath110 . for a 3-dimensional survey geometry , such as a sphere or cube , at scales @xmath111 small compared to the survey size",
    ", we would expect this integrand to be sharply peaked at @xmath112 ; that is , convolution effects would not be important and the measured convolved power would be very close to the true power",
    ". however , the las campanas survey has essentially a two - dimensional geometry : it is large in two dimensions but thin along the third ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figslices ] ) .",
    "convolution effects can be noticeably important at scales smaller than the survey size , and `` aliasing '' occurs : power at @xmath113 makes a significant contribution to the convolved power @xmath109 at @xmath108 , leading to the effects noticed from figure  [ figodmsim ] .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figkernel ] , for @xmath114  mpc@xmath25 , the integrand is broad and somewhat complicated in shape , including contributions from a large range of @xmath110 .",
    "the situation improves for smaller scales and larger @xmath108 , as the integrand becomes more and more sharply peaked at @xmath112 . nevertheless ,",
    "though these convolution effects are complicated in detail , they can be computed and accounted for in the power spectrum analysis , as we saw earlier .",
    "we compute the power spectrum in redshift space , but first convert our heliocentric redshifts to comoving distances @xmath115 , assuming @xmath20 . using a different value for @xmath116 does not make much difference ; for example , @xmath115 changes by 2% at @xmath0 if we instead use @xmath117 .",
    "we first consider the power spectrum for magnitude - limited samples of the lcrs .",
    "we thus need to weight by the inverse of the selection function , but we note that this weighting becomes large when the selection function becomes small at large distances , where only the intrinsically brightest and rarest galaxies are observed . also , because of the surface brightness cuts imposed on the sample , we do not probe the galaxy luminosity function well at the faint end ( @xcite ) , but these intrinsically faint galaxies could make a large contribution in the weighting . to reduce the sensitivity of our power spectrum results to these potential problems ,",
    "we make additional restrictions on the redshifts and absolute magnitudes of the galaxies used in our clustering analyses : 10000 km  s@xmath118 45000 km  s@xmath25 ( or @xmath119  mpc ) and @xmath120 .",
    "these limits keep the selection function @xmath121 , and result in a total sample of 19305 galaxies .",
    "the weight function @xmath122 used in equation  ( [ eqsum ] ) for galaxy @xmath60 of the survey is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a weighting factor which accounts for variable field - to - field sampling fractions and incompletenesses as a function of apparent magnitude and central surface brightness ( details in @xcite ) , and @xmath125 is the selection function appropriate to the survey field containing galaxy @xmath60 , @xmath126}_{max[m_1({\\bf r}_i),m_1 ] } \\phi(m ) dm     \\left/       \\int^{m_2}_{m_1 } \\phi(m ) dm     \\right .",

    "for @xmath129 we use a schechter luminosity function ( @xcite ) with parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 ; details concerning the derivation of the luminosity function are given in lin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig415](a ) shows the observed convolved @xmath132 for the full lcrs sample defined above , computed using the methods detailed in ",
    "[ ps : methods ] .",
    "we have also split the full sample into four subsamples by dividing each of the northern and southern data subsets in half by ra ; see table  [ ps : tabsamps ] for details .",
    "the individual @xmath132 for the four subsamples are also plotted in figure  [ fig415 ] .",
    "we use the standard deviations of the mean of @xmath132 for the subsamples , or the @xmath133 errors from the whole - lcrs odm mock surveys of ",
    "[ subntest ] , whichever is larger , to estimate the @xmath133 errors for the full sample .",
    "we also note that though we average @xmath134 over different directions of @xmath135 at fixed @xmath136 in equation  ( [ eqpkest ] ) , results from the mock surveys show that the errors depend only weakly on direction .",
    "the convolution effects are quite similar for all five samples shown in figure  [ fig415](a ) , so that the convolved power spectra may be directly compared .",
    "there is good agreement among the four subsamples for wavelengths @xmath137  mpc . on larger scales , aside from sampling fluctuations , uncertainties in the survey s selection function and mean density will also contribute to the differences among the samples .",
    "we have also divided the data into 50-fiber and 112-fiber subsets ( see table  [ ps : tabsamps ] ) , and computed the convolved power spectrum for each subsample , with the results plotted in figure  [ fig415](b ) .",
    "again , the convolution effects for these two subsets are similar so we directly compare them",
    ". there are no conspicuous systematic differences between the power spectra computed from 50- vs.  112-fiber data , giving us confidence that the power spectrum is not sensitive to the different sampling and photometric selection criteria involved .",
    "the two subsamples agree well for @xmath138  mpc .",
    "we can also check the consequences on the power spectrum arising from two geometric selection effects of the survey .",
    "first , recall from   [ intro ] that an instrumental constraint prevents two galaxy fibers from approaching closer than @xmath35 on the sky . in the odm mock surveys",
    "we have actually applied this restriction and our previous results indicate apparently little effect on the power spectrum .",
    "more explicitly , we can assign fake velocities to those unobserved objects which lie within @xmath35 of an observed survey galaxy , and then recompute the power spectrum",
    ". some fraction of these pairs will be physically associated , and we assign velocities to the unobserved objects according to the distribution of pairwise velocity differences for observed survey galaxy pairs with angular separations between @xmath139 and @xmath140 . for this purpose",
    "we use a very generous upper bound of 5000 km  s@xmath25 for the velocity difference , corresponding to 60% of the observed velocity difference distribution .",
    "the remaining 40% of pairs are assumed to be chance superpositions , for which we assign velocities to the unobserved objects according to the overall redshift histogram of the particular survey field containing that pair .",
    "note that this procedure adds an average of 1351 galaxies to the full lcrs sample used for power spectrum computation . figure  [ figgeo](a ) plots the full range of the power spectrum computed from 10 different sets of such velocity assignments , and confirms that the full - sample lcrs power spectrum is indeed very little affected over the scales probed ( @xmath141 difference ) .",
    "second , as described in shectman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the spectroscopic success rate is lower ( though still @xmath142 ) at the corners of the spectroscopic fields .",
    "we can approximately compensate for this effect by calculating a `` neighborhood '' sampling fraction within an area of radius @xmath143 centered on each galaxy , and then applying this additional geometric weighting in ( [ eqweight ] ) .",
    "the choice of regions of @xmath143 radius to define the weights came from trial and error efforts to best reproduce the angular pair distribution of the survey photometric catalog , by appropriately weighting the pair distribution of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "figure  [ figgeo](b ) shows that applying this correction also has little effect on the lcrs power spectrum . for simplicity ,",
    "since both the above geometric effects are small , we will neglect them in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we next use the lucy deconvolution procedures outlined in   [ ps : methods ] to obtain estimates of the deconvolved @xmath144 for the full sample and the four subsamples , with the results for the full sample displayed in figure  [ fignsfit ] . here",
    "we again estimate errors using the sdom of the four subsamples , or the @xmath133 errors from the deconvolved power spectra of the whole - lcrs odm mock surveys , whichever is larger . besides using lucy deconvolution",
    ", we have also convolved a convenient model for the power spectrum and fit to the observed lcrs full sample @xmath132 : @xmath145 the model was motivated by a similar fitting formula applied to the apm data by peacock ( 1991 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the model has four free parameters ( @xmath146 ) , and essentially it behaves as a power law with slope @xmath147 at small scales ( large @xmath108 ) , changing to another power law with slope @xmath148 at large scales ( small @xmath108 ) ( we take @xmath149 ) .",
    "the transition occurs near wavenumber @xmath150 , and there remains an overall normalization that can be more meaningfully expressed in terms of @xmath99 .",
    "we find @xmath151 we plot the fit in figure  [ fignsfit ] .",
    "note that for @xmath152  mpc , the power spectrum is well - determined .",
    "there is an apparent peak at about @xmath153  mpc , but on larger scales the form of @xmath3 is not too well determined , with our fit power law slope consistent with a flat to declining @xmath3 with decreasing @xmath108 . we want to emphasize that for @xmath28  mpc , the errors are unavoidably large and we do not claim detection of a turnover in the power spectrum , only that our results suggest that @xmath3 is at least flattening out on these largest scales .",
    "improved power spectrum estimation techniques , as recently described by tegmark ( 1995 ) or by vogeley & szalay ( 1996 ) , may prove to be helpful in reducing the errors on the large - scale power spectrum , though application of these methods is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "as we mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , a complementary analysis of the 2d lcrs power spectrum may be found in landy et al .  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the wavevectors in the 2d treatment are aligned along the `` planes '' of each of the six slices , rather than averaged over the whole sphere as they are in this paper .",
    "the 2d analysis thus emphasizes those spatial directions for which the survey geometry is best suited on large scales .",
    "this renders the 2d analysis less sensitive to the presence of aliased power and therefore more sensitive to the presence of features in the power spectrum on large scales .",
    "in particular , a striking peak at @xmath154  mpc is seen in the 2d power spectrum , and it is a signature of the clear pattern of over- and under - dense regions ( e.g. , walls and voids ) in the lcrs galaxy distribution ( figure  [ figslices ] ) .",
    "a different `` core - sampling '' analysis applied to the lcrs by doroshkevich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also indicates that @xmath155  mpc is approximately the typical separation between large sheet - like structures in the galaxy distribution .",
    "these results are also reminiscent of a similar peak at @xmath156  mpc in the 1d power spectrum of deep pencil beam surveys analyzed by broadhurst et al .",
    "a peak at @xmath154  mpc is also suggested in the 3d power spectrum fit above , though it does not stand out in figure  [ fignsfit ] , both because of the logarithmic y - axis scaling and because of the suppression due to aliasing as mentioned above .",
    "the focus of the 2d paper is on the @xmath155  mpc scale power , and the reader is referred to landy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the full details . on the other hand , the current analysis has the broader goal of relating the full lcrs power spectrum , in the more usual 3d context , to results from previous surveys , to cobe constraints , and to predictions of cosmological models .",
    "we proceed now to compare the lcrs power spectrum to that determined from several other large galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "first , figure  [ figcfa ] shows the comparison to the power spectra of three samples drawn from the ssrs2 and cfa2 redshift surveys : two volume - limited samples ssrs2+cfa2 101 ( @xmath157 mpc , @xmath158 ) and ssrs2+cfa2 130 ( @xmath159 mpc , @xmath160 ; @xcite ) , and one apparent - magnitude - limited sample cfa 101 m ( @xmath157 mpc , @xmath161 ; @xcite ) .",
    "now , while the las campanas galaxies have been selected from photometry in a red wavelength band , the ssrs2 and cfa2 galaxies were selected in the blue . as a rough guide to compare the red and blue magnitudes",
    ", we note that @xmath162 ( @xcite ) , while @xmath163 ( @xcite ) and @xmath164 ( @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the lcrs @xmath3 is in remarkably good agreement with the @xmath3 of the magnitude - limited cfa101 m and volume - limited ssrs2+cfa2 101 samples .",
    "there are some differences , though they are not at high significance given the errors . specifically , the lcrs power spectrum is lower than ssrs2+cfa2 101 on intermediate scales @xmath165  mpc , and it is also low relative to these other two samples on large scales @xmath166 mpc . in contrast , the power spectrum of the volume - limited ssrs2+cfa2 130 sample is higher than that of the lcrs on _ all _ scales examined .",
    "most simply , these @xmath3 differences may just be due to cosmic variance that arises from the different volumes being sampled in the three surveys .",
    "alternatively , luminosity bias might help reconcile some of the differences we see , in the sense that intrinsically brighter galaxies are more strongly clustered .",
    "we note that the two volume - limited ssrs2+cfa2 samples are restricted to galaxies brighter than @xmath167 and @xmath168 , whereas the lcrs sample contains galaxies between approximately @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the magnitude - limited cfa101 m sample does contain galaxies both brighter and fainter than @xmath167 , and seems the best match to the lcrs .",
    "park et al .  ( 1994 ) find evidence for luminosity bias in the cfa survey , and we explore this possibility for the lcrs in   [ lumbias ] . as another alternative",
    ", the differences between the two surveys may reflect intrinsic clustering differences of galaxies selected in different wavelength bands , red for the lcrs vs.  blue for the other two surveys , analogous to the effect observed for cfa galaxies vs.  infrared - selected iras galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "the galaxy sampling and surface brightness selection criteria of the lcrs are unlikely to produce a systematic bias in our power spectrum estimates over the scales probed , given the results of the test done in   [ subntest ] and the agreement of the 50- and 112-fiber results in figure  [ fig415](b ) .",
    "we next compare the lcrs @xmath3 to that found from two redshift surveys of iras galaxies : the 1.2 jy survey ( 60 @xmath171 m flux @xmath172 1.2 jy ; @xcite ) and the deeper but more sparsely sampled qdot sample ( 60 @xmath171 m flux @xmath172 0.6 jy ; @xcite ) . as seen in figure  [ figiras ] , the iras 1.2 jy @xmath3 is lower than that of the lcrs over all scales probed , particularly for @xmath173  mpc .",
    "fisher et al .  (",
    "1993 ) have shown that the 1.2 jy @xmath3 is very similar in _ shape _ to the cfa 101 @xmath3 , but that the overall clustering amplitude for iras galaxies is lower . in redshift space",
    "@xmath174 , @xmath175 , while the lcrs is in between , with @xmath176 .",
    "the clustering strength seen in the 1.2 jy survey may reflect the inherently weaker clustering amplitude of the iras galaxy population , which tend to be spirals that avoid rich clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have selected from the lcrs a sample of emission galaxies , with [ oii ] @xmath1773727 equivalent widths @xmath178   , which should also tend to be spirals , as well as a sample of galaxies with @xmath179   , which should include more ellipticals ( see table  [ ps : tabsamps ] ) .",
    "we compare the relative convolved power spectra of the whole , emission , and non - emission lcrs samples in figure  [ figem5 ] .",
    "we find that for scales @xmath180  mpc , the emission sample is about 30% more weakly clustered than the full sample , while the non - emission sample is about 25% more strongly clustered than the full sample , and these results are roughly independent of scale .",
    "the same trends persist up to @xmath181  mpc , though the errors become larger for @xmath28  mpc ( here again the errors have been estimated from the variation among the four lcrs subsamples divided by hemisphere and right ascension ) . though the difference is not as great as for iras vs.  lcrs galaxies , our results are consistent with an intrinsically weaker clustering strength of spiral and emission - line galaxies on scales @xmath152  mpc .",
    "galaxies with early morphological types have been observed to be more strongly clustered than late types in a fair number of previous smaller samples , exploring generally smaller clustering scales ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our current results are thus in qualitative agreement , though the lack of one - to - one correspondence between morphologies and emission strengths vitiates a more quantitative comparison .",
    "we note next from figure  [ figiras ] that the lcrs and qdot results are in somewhat better agreement , except that the qdot slope is steeper , in the sense of having more relative power for scales @xmath182  mpc compared to scales @xmath183  mpc .",
    "feldman et al .  ( 1993 ) also point out a turnover in the qdot @xmath3 for @xmath166  mpc .",
    "the lcrs @xmath3 shows an apparent peak at roughly similar scales , @xmath184  mpc , but the constraint on the slope of the lcrs power spectrum on larger scales is not strong , as it can accommodate both declining to flat power spectra for @xmath185  mpc (   [ pslcrs ] ) .",
    "note finally that the qdot and 1.2 jy results differ somewhat for @xmath106  mpc .",
    "feldman et al .  ( 1994 ) attribute this to sampling fluctuations rather than to luminosity bias among iras galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sampling fluctuation argument is also indicated by the analysis of tadros & efstathiou ( 1995 ) , who have calculated the power spectrum of the combined 1.2 jy and qdot samples .",
    "overall , for scales @xmath186  mpc , despite some apparent differences , the power spectra from the various surveys are broadly consistent with each other given the large errors common to all the surveys .",
    "on smaller scales , the power spectra of the different surveys show similar shapes , but there are differences in amplitude which may reflect intrinsic variations in clustering strength for galaxies of different luminosities or types .",
    "we will explore the dependence of clustering on luminosity for lcrs galaxies next .",
    "nonetheless , it is noteworthy that the _ independent _ , _ optically_-selected surveys lcrs and ssrs2+cfa2 , which also provide the _ largest _ galaxy samples , do in fact agree well over the range of scales probed .",
    "as we saw in   [ otherz ] and figure  [ figcfa ] , the ssrs2+cfa2 130 sample ( @xmath187 ) , which contains intrinsically brighter galaxies than the ssrs2+cfa2 101 sample ( @xmath188 ) , has a power spectrum amplitude @xmath189 greater than that of ssrs2+cfa2 101 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by this evidence of luminosity bias , here expressed as the variation of power spectrum amplitude with galaxy luminosity in the ssrs2 and cfa2 surveys , we would like to test for evidence of the same in the lcrs .",
    "recall that these two samples are volume - limited , with galaxies brighter than @xmath163 and @xmath164 , whereas our earlier magnitude - limited lcrs sample contains galaxies both brighter and fainter than @xmath162 .",
    "volume - limited samples , defined by both a lower and an upper bound on absolute magnitude , are a more natural choice over apparent - magnitude - limited samples for the purpose of examining how the power spectrum changes as a function of absolute luminosity . also , for volume - limited samples the selection function is simpler to deal with .",
    "however , the @xmath190-mag band in the isophotal magnitude limits of the 50-fiber data restricts drawing volume - limited samples to inconveniently small distance and absolute magnitude ranges , so we will confine the analysis to the 112-fiber data , which have wider @xmath191-mag isophotal limits . within the same redshift limits 10000 km",
    "s@xmath118 45000 km  s@xmath25 as applied to the earlier apparent - magnitude - limited full lcrs sample , we form seven volume - limited samples , with absolute magnitude limits @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "table  [ tabvolsamps ] summarizes details of these samples . in the power spectrum calculation",
    ", we set the weight function for galaxy @xmath60 to @xmath196 ( see   [ pslcrs ] ) .",
    "one complication that we note from table  [ tabvolsamps ] is that the different volume - limited samples do not necessarily overlap much in space with one another , and one might wonder whether any differences seen among the samples may be due to sampling fluctuations rather than to actual luminosity bias . in order to better isolate the luminosity dependence , we adopt a procedure similar to that applied by hamilton ( 1988 ) in examining the variation of the correlation function amplitude with galaxy luminosity in the cfa1 survey .",
    "we divide each volume - limited sample in half by absolute magnitude ( i.e. , the @xmath193 would be split into two samples with @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) , calculate the ratio of the power spectra of the brighter and fainter subsets ( which are located in the same volume of space ) , and finally multiply ( or divide ) these ratios in successive volume - limited samples in order to determine the relative clustering amplitudes as a function of luminosity .",
    "we arbitrarily set the clustering amplitude of the @xmath199 sample , which contains @xmath162 , to unity .",
    "we apply this procedure to the whole - survey volume - limited samples , and estimate errors from the variation among volume - limited samples from the four subsets of the whole survey divided by hemisphere and right ascension ( recall figure  [ fig415](a ) ) .",
    "we also average our results over four roughly equal bins in @xmath200 , as shown in figure  [ figpowrat ] : @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204  mpc .",
    "we note first from the figure that results for the bin at @xmath204  mpc are quite noisy and the errors are large enough to be consistent with no variation of clustering amplitude with luminosity .",
    "we will focus attention on the three bins in the range from @xmath205  mpc , where the errors are not so large .",
    "we also find that the variation of clustering amplitude with absolute magnitude is fairly scale - independent over this range of @xmath177 .",
    "we see that for @xmath206 the clustering amplitude changes little with absolute magnitude . for galaxies brighter than @xmath207 ,",
    "the clustering amplitude appears to rise with luminosity ; in particular , for @xmath208 , the brightest bin with still reasonably small errors , the clustering amplitude is @xmath209 that at @xmath210 .",
    "the departures from no luminosity bias are relatively mild , except in the brightest bin , where unfortunately the errors are also large .",
    "nevertheless , there does appear to be about a 50% stronger clustering for galaxies brighter than about @xmath12 relative to those fainter , in general agreement with the amount of luminosity bias seen in the cfa2 and ssrs2 surveys .",
    "the trends seen in figure  [ figpowrat ] are similar to analogous results for scales @xmath211  mpc from the much smaller cfa1 survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results are also similar to recent findings from the large - volume , but 1-in-20 sparse - sampled stromlo - apm survey ( @xcite , @xcite ) , except that we do not see a much weaker clustering amplitude for sub-@xmath210 galaxies that loveday et al.find .",
    "the difference might be due the fact that we do not use galaxies fainter than about @xmath212 that were included in the analysis of the stromlo - apm data .",
    "in addition , recent correlation function analysis of the ssrs2 sample ( @xcite ) indicates a luminosity bias trend similar to that seen in the lcrs .",
    "we note however that the lcrs provides advantages with its combination of sample size , sampling density , and depth over other redshift surveys , and likely provides the best current sample to examine the luminosity bias effect .",
    "the fact that the luminosity bias we see for super-@xmath210 galaxies persists to fairly large scales argues for a primordial rather than a local environmental effect as its root cause .",
    "specifically , our results are qualitatively consistent with the biased galaxy formation scenario , in which brighter galaxies form out of higher peaks in the underlying mass distribution and are therefore more strongly clustered , because such higher peaks are _ naturally _ more clustered in models like cdm with an initially gaussian field of mass density fluctuations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "also , the large - scale clustering bias seen earlier for our emission and non - emission samples is also tied to some extent into the luminosity bias issue , as we have found that our non - emission sample is dominated by super-@xmath210 galaxies and our emission sample by sub-@xmath210 objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the emission ( @xmath213 morphology ) and luminosity bias effects are independent , as evidenced in the stromlo - apm survey ( @xcite ) , then some primordial influence would also be suggested in relation to the galaxy star formation rate , for which [ oii ] @xmath1773727 is a rough indicator ( @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we have simply laid out our initial observations of these type - dependent clustering differences ; we plan a more detailed examination of the the effects we have found and their quantitative implications for biased galaxy formation models .",
    "in addition , note that our present results have been limited to redshift - space , and it will be useful , though expectedly more difficult and noisy , to factor out the redshift distortion effects by examining the clustering in real space , which we also plan to attempt .",
    "we can however draw some brief conclusions in the context of the recent semi - analytic galaxy formation models of kauffmann et al.(1995 ) .",
    "in particular , their work indicates that the bias factor @xmath97 should depend only weakly on scale ( also @xcite ) , consistent with our observations .",
    "also , their models predict that the amount of luminosity bias should decrease with increasing @xmath99 of the underlying _ mass _ power spectrum .",
    "specifically , their figure  6 indicates that on scales @xmath214  mpc , galaxies with @xmath215 are more biased relative to those with @xmath216 , by factors of about 1.5 for @xmath217 and @xmath218 for @xmath219 . for comparison",
    ", we can convert the relative power values of figure  [ figpowrat ] into relative bias values ( recall power @xmath220 ) , and then make the appropriate sum over the lcrs luminosity function in order to determine the average bias over some absolute magnitude range .",
    "we find for scales @xmath221  mpc that the bias of @xmath222 galaxies is @xmath223 times that of @xmath224 galaxies ( the stronger clustering of bright galaxies is more than compensated by their reduced numbers in the luminosity function ) .",
    "our results are on the weak luminosity bias end of the range of kauffmann et al .  models , and thus imply that @xmath225 should be high , @xmath226 .",
    "as this is near the observed _ galaxy _ @xmath99 , it also indicates that lcrs galaxies may be unbiased tracers of the mass .",
    "we return to this point below in   [ linear ] .",
    "we now compare the lcrs results against the expectations of cosmological models .",
    "we begin with a brief comparison using two particular n - body simulations , which allow us to examine the model power spectra over both small and large scales",
    ". then we proceed to widen the explorable parameter space by concentrating on fitting the lcrs power spectrum on large scales in the linear regime , and compare against the predictions of several classes of cdm - motivated models . in combination with cobe and other large scale structure constraints ,",
    "the large scale lcrs power spectrum will help us delineate the allowed parameter space in these cosmological models .",
    "we compare the lcrs power spectrum to that of two n - body models , both kindly provided by changbom park : ( 1 ) the odm model of ",
    "[ subntest ] , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and bias factor @xmath96 ; and ( 2 ) the cdm1 model , which has @xmath20 , @xmath95 , and @xmath227 .",
    "the cdm1 model was computed with a particle - mesh code on a @xmath228 mesh , physical comoving volume @xmath229  mpc@xmath104 , and contains @xmath230 cdm particles and @xmath231 biased `` galaxy '' particles , chosen by the biasing scheme of park ( 1991 ) .",
    "both models are normalized so that the galaxy @xmath98 .",
    "the _ convolved _ redshift - space power spectra of the lcrs and the n - body models are plotted in figure  [ figpnsdm ] .",

    ", we can use a rank - sum test to see how probable it is to draw the lcrs power spectrum from the population of n - body mock - survey power spectra .",
    "we choose the rank - sum test as it is simpler to apply than a @xmath236 test ; we need not make any assumptions about either the distribution of power at each @xmath108 or about the correlations between the power at different @xmath108 . at each wavenumber @xmath108",
    ", we first assign each of the 30 odm mock - survey plus 1 lcrs samples a rank @xmath237 in order of increasing power ( the index @xmath60 denotes the sample ) .",
    "then , for each of the 31 samples we combine the ranks at different @xmath108 by forming the sum @xmath238",
    ". finally we assign each sample an overall rank @xmath239 in order of ascending @xmath240 . doing this results in the lcrs receiving a rank @xmath241 , giving us a two - tailed confidence interval of @xmath242 = 87% for rejecting the null hypothesis that the lcrs power spectrum is drawn from the population of odm power spectra .",
    "this is not very high significance , and it will be further weakened by the fact that since we only have one odm simulation box , we do not sample the full range of variation as we would given an entire ensemble of odm simulation boxes .",
    "nevertheless , the rank - sum test does give us a simple quantitative measure of how well the odm model can match the lcrs data .",
    "likewise , the rank - sum test applied to 30 cdm1 mock - survey plus 1 lcrs samples gives @xmath243 , where we now assign @xmath237 in order of _ decreasing _ power because the lcrs power is greater than that of most of the cdm1 mock surveys .",
    "the two - tailed confidence interval for rejecting cdm1 is then just 35% . repeating the rank - sum tests , but now just focusing on large scales @xmath244 mpc@xmath25 , we find @xmath245 for both odm and cdm1 , so now the rejection probabilities are 94% in both cases .",
    "the match of the cdm1 model to the lcrs is thus appreciably worse when considering only large scales , while the match of the odm model is little changed .",
    "neither model provides a completely satisfactory match to the lcrs power spectrum over all the scales which we probe .",
    "the lcrs power spectrum lies between that of the two models , and as we will see in the next section , the lcrs power spectrum on large scales is better matched by a linear cdm model with @xmath246 .      for any particular structure formation model ,",
    "the best comparison procedure with observations is to draw out mock redshift surveys as we did in   [ subntest ] .",
    "however , it will be useful to fit our observations to analytic models in order to explore more of cosmological parameter space than permitted by park s two n - body models . to do a proper fit to a _ nonlinear , redshift - space _ power spectrum given a _ linear",
    ", real - space _ model requires us to account for the following : ( 1 ) the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum ; ( 2 ) the bias relating the galaxy fluctuations to the underlying mass fluctuations ; and ( 3 ) the distortions caused by mapping from real to redshift space .",
    "though these three effects may be modelled analytically ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we will take a simpler route and concentrate on fitting just those observations on large scales in , at least approximately , the linear regime .",
    "we thus sacrifice the information we have on small scales for the simplicity of not having to model the nonlinear effects ( which perhaps are best dealt with via n - body simulations ) .    to specify our assumptions , note the following relations connecting the galaxy power spectrum and the underlying mass power spectrum : @xmath247 where @xmath248 is some function describing the bias of the galaxy power spectrum relative to that of the mass , and @xmath249 describes the effect of redshift distortions caused by galaxy peculiar velocities .",
    "in general , the particular functional forms of @xmath250 and @xmath251 will depend on the parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "we make the simple assumption that over the scales we consider , @xmath252 constant , where @xmath97 is the bias factor . for @xmath253 , there are two main regimes .",
    "as derived by kaiser ( 1987 ) , on large scales in the linear regime , the redshift - space power spectrum is amplified by the infall of galaxies from low- to high - density regions , and @xmath254 ( more commonly in the literature the fractions @xmath255 and @xmath256 in the above equation are replaced by 0.6 and 1.2 respectively ; but see @xcite . ) on the other hand , on small scales in the nonlinear regime , the redshift - space power spectrum is suppressed by the smearing of the clustering pattern from small - scale galaxy peculiar velocities .",
    "for example , if we assume that galaxies have a small - scale gaussian peculiar velocity field with a one - dimensional dispersion @xmath257 , then @xmath258 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , here we will focus on the linear regime and so assume that @xmath259 p_{mass , real - space , linear}(k)\\ ] ] holds as a useful approximation , that is , the redshift - space galaxy power spectrum is just a constant times the real - space mass power spectrum .    since the density fluctuations in the galaxy distribution should be less than unity in the linear regime , and since we observe that the galaxy fluctuations in @xmath260 mpc radius spheres @xmath98 , we need to restrict our fits at least to @xmath261  mpc )",
    ". we will use @xmath262  mpc@xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath263  mpc .",
    "though this choice is somewhat arbitrary , it is motivated by our desire to extend the fit range beyond the flat part of the convolved power spectrum ( to improve the handle on the power spectrum shape ) , but not so far that nonlinear effects become important . that ( [ eqlineartoz ] ) approximately holds over our @xmath108 range has justification . theoretical work ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "indicates that constant linear biasing does hold on large scales .",
    "there is also empirical evidence , from the comparison of real- and redshift - space galaxy power spectra from the survey compilation of peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) , and in particular , from the comparison of various galaxy survey power spectra ( _ including _ lcrs ) against the _ mass _ power spectrum derived from peculiar velocity catalogs over the range @xmath264  mpc@xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will thus fit various model linear power spectra ( to be described below ) to the full sample magnitude - limited lcrs _",
    "convolved _ power spectrum for @xmath265  mpc@xmath25 .",
    "one complication is that because of correlations among the data points on large scales , a rigorous fit requires us to calculate and account for the covariance matrix of the errors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , for simplicity we take a more empirical approach and estimate the errors for the fit parameters from the variation among our usual four lcrs subsamples and from the n - body mock surveys .",
    "we focus on the case of inflationary , dark - matter dominated cosmological models , in which case we may write @xmath266 where @xmath267 is a normalization factor , @xmath268 is the inflation - produced primordial power spectrum of spectral index @xmath269 , and @xmath270 is a transfer function that modifies the primordial spectrum .",
    "note that the shape of the power spectrum is parameterized by the index @xmath269 and by the form of @xmath270 , which in turn depends on the specific matter content of the universe .",
    "now , because we are fitting over a relatively small range in @xmath108 , and because the convolved power spectrum tends to flatten out over the same @xmath108 range , regardless of the true power spectrum shape , the lcrs results will not constrain the true shape very strongly . on the other hand ,",
    "given a specific power spectrum shape , the lcrs results do give fairly stringent constraints on the power spectrum normalization .",
    "using our earlier mock surveys and the usual procedure of dividing into four subsamples , we estimate a @xmath271 fractional error of about 10% in the normalization , obtained by fitting to the full - sample lcrs power spectrum over our desired @xmath108 range .",
    "however , there is still freedom in the choice of bias parameter @xmath97 ( equation  [ [ eqbias ] ] ) so that we can not fix an absolute normalization from our galaxy data .",
    "the absolute mass normalization @xmath267 can instead be determined independently using results from the cobe dmr experiment .",
    "we can then turn the problem around and use our derived galaxy normalization @xmath272 to determine the value of @xmath97 needed to reconcile the lcrs and cobe normalizations via the relation @xmath273 b_{mass } \\approx b_{lcrs}\\ .\\ ] ] we note that theoretical models suggest a bias @xmath97 near unity or larger ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "empirically , we see within the lcrs that emission / non - emission samples have bias values within @xmath274 that of the full sample ( power @xmath220 ) , and that super-@xmath210 galaxies have bias @xmath275 times that of fainter galaxies .",
    "likewise , peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) find a relative bias between optical and iras galaxies of @xmath276 , and kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) find a range @xmath277 in relative bias parameters for various surveys , including lcrs .",

    "the most dramatic difference in the open cdm case vs. the flat @xmath283cdm case arises from the much weaker variation with @xmath116 of the cobe normalization .",

    "_ here we plot @xmath97 and @xmath225 vs. the spectral index @xmath269 , again for the two cases @xmath95 and 0.8 , in figure  [ figtcdm ] . for @xmath95 and @xmath329",
    "the models are unbiased and also satisfy cluster abundances .",
    "the lcrs fit gives @xmath330 .",
    "for @xmath324 we instead need @xmath331 to meet the constraints , but this appears to violate the direct cobe dmr fit to the spectral index , @xmath332 ( @xmath271 ; @xcite ) .    in summary , all the simple cdm variants we have considered can provide models that simultaneously satisfy the lcrs large scale power spectrum shape constraints , have hubble constant @xmath17 , give an approximately unbiased lcrs galaxy distribution on large scales , and meet the cluster abundance constraints .",
    "for each of our four cdm classes , we plot in figure  [ figcobe ] specific example linear power spectra that meet the above criteria : @xmath333 the model linear power spectra are shown both unconvolved and convolved , and compared to the corresponding lcrs results .",
    "note the similarity in the shapes of the convolved power spectra , which we are actually fitting .",
    "however , not surprisingly , the true unconvolved spectra do in fact differ more in shape , and they also show more power compared to the directly deconvolved lcrs power spectrum for @xmath334  mpc . also shown are corresponding cobe @xmath271 error boxes , shifted to redshift space using equation  ( [ eqlineartoz ] ) and the appropriate bias value .    the acceptable regions of our cdm model parameter space appear to be the following .",
    "flat @xmath20 , @xmath95 models are still viable , if we add massive neutrinos with @xmath21 or a spectral tilt @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , flat @xmath335 cdm models with @xmath336 and @xmath337 will also do , and similarly for open cdm models with @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "we also note that these models can provide @xmath225 values near unity , which was suggested in the earlier comparison of our luminosity bias results with the predictions of kauffmann et al.(1995 ) .",
    "similarly , these models can also meet the constraint @xmath340 from peculiar velocity data ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , they also satisfy the 95% lower bound on the age of the universe , 12 gyr , as determined from the ages of the oldest globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have by no means attempted to exhaustively compare our results to all the possibilities ( e.g. , we can incorporate tilt in the open models , add gravity waves , and so on ) , but have simply explored some simple variations on the cdm theme , and have seen that there is already room for a number of such viable models .",
    "the next generation of _ very _ large redshift surveys , such as sloan ( @xcite ) and 2df ( @xcite ) should provide us with improvements on the large - scale galaxy power spectrum ( @xcite ) . in conjunction with improvements in degree - scale microwave anisotropy experments ( e.g. , see reviews by @xcite ; @xcite ) , the convergence of the large scale structure and microwave background observational fronts will hopefully give us a more definitive answer .",
    "on the other hand , for smaller scales @xmath341  mpc , @xmath3 is already quite well constrained in the lcrs .",
    "in particular , any viable model must match these small scale results , as we have seen earlier in the case of our two n - body models .",
    "the complication here is that galaxies exhibit type - dependent clustering differences ( as is the case for our emission samples and for our super-@xmath210 galaxies ) , which will make it more difficult to interpret which types of galaxies are actually being simulated by the models , in as much as the process of galaxy formation is still not well understood , and there is freedom of choice in how one s `` galaxies '' are defined and represented in the simulations .",
    "the connection between the n - body models and the statistics of a galaxy sample will remain a weak link which will require a more thorough understanding of the types of galaxies selected by a particular survey and their relation to the underlying density fluctuations .",
    "we have computed the power spectrum for a magnitude - limited sample of 19305 las campanas survey galaxies , with average redshift @xmath0 and absolute magnitudes @xmath342 , over scales @xmath105  mpc .",
    "@xmath3 may be approximated by a power law @xmath343 , with slopes @xmath344 on small scales @xmath345  mpc , and @xmath346 on the largest scales @xmath347  mpc .",
    "the change in slope of @xmath3 is real and could be the result of a possible maximum in @xmath3 observed at @xmath348  mpc , though our errors preclude a definitive detection of the turnover .",
    "the overall amplitude may be expressed as @xmath349 in redshift space .",
    "we have also compared our results to those from other redshift surveys . for @xmath350  mpc ,",
    "the lcrs @xmath3 is similar in shape to that of the other samples , but with some differences in amplitude that may reflect intrinsic clustering differences for galaxies of different luminosities or types ( below ) . for @xmath351  mpc ,",
    "the lcrs results are consistent with those of other surveys given the large errors among all the surveys on these scales .",
    "the overall lcrs results agree best with that from the combined ssrs2+cfa2 redshift surveys .",
    "we find evidence in the lcrs for the dependence of clustering strength on galaxy type . a sample of lcrs emission galaxies with [ oii ] @xmath1773727 equivalent widths",
    "@xmath352   are about 30% less clustered than the full lcrs sample on scales @xmath152  mpc .",
    "this may reflect an intrinsically weaker clustering strength for spiral galaxies , in qualitative agreement with the weaker clustering of iras vs.  optically - selected galaxies .",
    "we also compute the power spectra of volume - limited lcrs samples to test for evidence of luminosity bias .",
    "we find that lcrs galaxies in the range @xmath353 appear to be clustered similarly , over scales @xmath354  mpc .",
    "however , more luminous galaxies , which lie about 1 magnitude brighter than @xmath355 , exhibit about a 50% stronger clustering amplitude , in agreement with similar results seen in the cfa2 and ssrs2 surveys and the qualitative expectations of biased galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "our full nonlinear power spectrum is intermediate between that of two cdm n - body models , an open @xmath14 model and a standard @xmath13 model , both normalized to @xmath98 for galaxies .",
    "the models agree well with the lcrs results on small scales @xmath356  mpc , but neither model provides a completely satisfactory fit to the full lcrs power spetrum . to explore more of model parameter space , we then fit the large scale lcrs power , on approximately linear scales @xmath357  mpc , to several classes of linear cdm models .",
    "we find that a number of viable models remain which can simultaneously satisfy constraints provided by the lcrs power spectrum , the hubble constant range @xmath358 , cluster abundance results , and the reasonable assumption that lcrs galaxies are approximately unbiased on large scales , relative to the mass normalization provided by the 4-year cobe dmr data .",
    "these models include : ( 1 ) flat @xmath359 cdm models with @xmath318 and shape parameter @xmath360 ; ( 2 ) open cdm models with @xmath361 and @xmath339 ; ( 3 ) flat @xmath20 models with cdm plus massive neutrinos of density @xmath21 ; and ( 4 ) flat @xmath20 cdm models with a spectral tilt @xmath22 .",
    "the present situation for power spectrum measurements from redshift surveys appears to fall into two regimes . on scales",
    "@xmath350  mpc , the power spectrum is well determined , and various surveys have consistently detected differences in the clustering strengths of different galaxy populations , though the latter effect may complicate interpretation of model predictions .",
    "on the largest scales @xmath351  mpc , however , the errors in @xmath3 are still large .",
    "we have not been able to conclusively rule out any of the popular classes of cdm models , though we have begun to constrain their parameter space .",
    "nonetheless , the observational picture should improve when the next generation of very large redshift surveys come on line , and as the degree - scale microwave background observations progress . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the las campanas results have already provided constraints on @xmath3 on both large and small scales , complementary to , and largely _ independent _ of , earlier results for smaller and shallower samples . furthermore , the type - dependent clustering differences observed in the survey should provide useful observational constraints on models that seek to reproduce accurately the clustering properties and formation histories for a realistic mix of galaxy types . toward this end ,",
    "interested readers are invited to obtain the las campanas redshift survey catalog , now publicly available at the internet site `` http://manaslu.astro.utoronto.ca/~lin/lcrs.html '' .",
    "we thank changbom park for providing the n - body models , michael vogeley for useful discussions and for providing the ssrs2+cfa2 results , hume feldman for the qdot results , and tsafrir kolatt for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "the las campanas redshift survey has been supported by nsf grants ast 87 - 17207 , ast 89 - 21326 , and ast 92 - 20460 .",

    "note added in proof : power spectrum results for the stromlo - apm redshift survey ( @xcite ) appeared after submission of the present paper .",
    "time does not permit a detailed comparison , but we note that the stromlo - apm authors report that their results are consistent with those of the cfa2 101 sample ( @xcite ) and that they also find evidence for the stronger clustering of galaxies brighter than @xmath210 .",
