    "the point - like x - ray source 2xmmj011028.1@xmath10460421 ( henceforth , hlx-1 for simplicity ) is the strongest intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) candidate known to date @xcite .",
    "it is seen in the sky at a distance of @xmath11 from the nucleus of the s0 galaxy eso243 - 49 ( redshift @xmath12 , luminosity distance @xmath13 mpc , distance modulus @xmath14 mag ; at this distance , @xmath15 pc ) .",
    "its x - ray luminosity and spectral variability @xcite are consistent with high and low states of an accreting bh .",
    "it shows recurrent outbursts every @xmath16 d ( seen in 2009 august , 2010 august , 2011 august ) , due either to some kind of disk instability , or to a periodic enhancement of the accretion rate .",
    "hlx-1 has an optical counterpart @xcite , with h@xmath17 emission at a redshift consistent with that of eso243 - 49 @xcite , which strongly suggests a true physical association .",
    "henceforth , we will assume that hlx-1 and eso243 - 49 are located at the same luminosity distance .",
    "the peak x - ray luminosity of hlx1 is @xmath18 erg s@xmath19 , three orders of magnitude higher than typical stellar - mass x - ray binaries , and one order of magnitude higher than the most luminous ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) found to - date .",
    "the bh mass required to be consistent with the eddington limit is @xmath20 , and a similar value is obtained from spectral modelling of the thermal x - ray component , which is consistent with emission from an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing unsolved questions about hlx-1 is where it came from .",
    "there are no other luminous x - ray sources in eso243 - 49 , in the range @xmath21@xmath22 erg s@xmath19 ; in fact , s0 galaxies do not generally contain extreme ulxs , which are more frequently found in spiral , irregular or interacting galaxies , with recent star formation @xcite .",
    "for example , ulxs as luminous as @xmath23 erg s@xmath19 have been seen in the cartwheel galaxy @xcite , representing the upper end of a rich population of luminous x - ray sources , probably high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "instead , hlx1 appears to be an odd case within eso243 - 49 .",
    "moreover , if the bh mass estimates are correct , hlx-1 is way too massive to have been formed from any stellar evolution process .",
    "two conservative scenarios are that hlx-1 may be : a ) the nuclear bh of a disrupted dwarf satellite galaxy , accreted by eso243 - 49 @xcite ; or , b ) an imbh formed inside a massive star cluster , perhaps via stellar coalescence and mergers @xcite . the location of hlx-1 outside the disk plane of eso243 - 49 is consistent with both scenarios  in fact , massive globular clusters such as @xmath24 cen in the milky way may themselves be the remnants of nucleated dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "imbhs in massive star clusters , or floating in the outskirts of galaxies after minor mergers @xcite , have been predicted from theoretical arguments , or speculatively inferred from dynamical modelling @xcite , but their existence is far from proven @xcite and they have never been confirmed directly as luminous , accreting sources .",
    "measuring the luminosity and colours of the optical counterpart , and their long - term variability , can help us test those scenarios . the optical emission may come from : the outer regions of the bh accretion disk ; a star cluster around the bh ; a single , massive and strongly irradiated donor star ; a combination of all three .",
    "if the optical counterpart is dominated by a star cluster , we want to constrain its mass and age , which may give us a clue on the imbh formation process .    in the rest of this paper , we present the results of our optical photometric study with the european southern observatory ( eso ) s very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "we use the optical and x - ray luminosities and colours to model the spectral energy distribution , and discuss the most likely scenarios for the optical emission .",
    "we also compare the optical brightness in our vlt images with the brightness measured in the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations of @xcite , taken when the x - ray luminosity of the source was higher .",
    "we observed hlx-1 with the visible multiobject spectrograph ( vimos ) mounted on the nasmyth focus b of ut3 melipal , one of the four 8-m vlt telescopes at cerro paranal .",
    "we took three images in each of the @xmath25 filters .",
    "our observations were carried out in service mode , and were split between the night of 2010 november 7 ( all @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and two out of three @xmath29 observations ) and 2010 november 26 ( the last @xmath29 and all @xmath30 observations ) .",

    "hlx-1 is clearly detected in emission as a point - like source ( figure 1 ) , coincident with the @xmath61 position and with the location of the optical counterpart identified from our _ magellan _ images last year @xcite . in order to estimate its optical flux more accurately , first we had to model and remove the contribution of the host galaxy , that dominates the background emission particularly at redder colours . to do this , we tried two alternative techniques .",
    "first , we tried modelling the galaxy light profile with @xcite , and use the residuals to estimate the emission from hlx-1 .",
    "the galaxy profile is quite complex ; we tried fitting it with a combination of a srsic profile plus exponential disk plus edge - on disk plus disky / boxy profile , and a dust mask .",
    "however , the narrow dust lane across the disk plane creates artifacts and ripples that badly affect the wings of the hlx-1 point spread function ( psf ) and the determination of the background level in the surrounding region ; much higher spatial resolution from _ hst _ imaging @xcite is probably needed for this kind of modelling .",
    "nonetheless , at least for the u and b bands , for which the galaxy halo contribution is less important , the residuals do show hlx-1 as a point - like emission source and the background subtraction is manageable .",
    "about @xmath62 west of hlx-1 , there is an extended , very blue source , probably a background star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
    "this extended source is mostly responsible for the enhanced , asymmetric near - uv emission measured by @xcite in the north - east quadrant of eso243 - 49 .",
    "after extensive tests , we concluded that the method applied to our vlt data provides accurate results for the u and b bands , but the background - subtraction error is too large for the other bands .",
    "we used a 3-pixel source extraction region , a background annulus between 5 and 9 pixels , and applied suitable aperture corrections for the two bands ( based on the psf of isolated stars ) to obtain the net count rates within an infinite aperture .",
    "we converted them to apparent magnitudes as outlined above .",
    "we obtained @xmath63 mag and @xmath64 mag .",
    "+   +    we then used the following , more accurate technique .",
    "we excluded a circle of 5-pixel radius around the target and fitted a thin plate spline solution to the surrounding @xmath65 ( pixel)@xmath66 area .",
    "this was done with the routine _ min_curve_surf_.",
    "this solution effectively follows the background exactly outside the exclusion zone , and provides a smooth solution for the background inside the exclusion zone ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the main caveat of this technique is that the estimated background within the exclusion zone is affected by the values right outside the edge of the exclusion zone ; in other words , if the exclusion circle is too small , the background inside it is overestimated , owing to the wings of hlx-1 s psf extending right outside the exclusion circle . on the other hand ,",
    "if the exclusion circle is too large , the fitting routine does not always provide smooth enough solutions through the whole aperture . after experimenting with several source and background region sizes",
    ", we decided to use an exclusion zone radius of 5 pixels and aperture radius of 3 pixels , from which we determined the net count rates ( subsequently corrected to infinite aperture , with aperture corrections individually determined for each band ) .",
    "we estimated that the fraction of source counts in the psf wings , falling in the background region , outside the 5-pixels exclusion radius , is between 5 and 10 per cent across the various filters ; this is negligible compared to the number of background counts , and does not significantly affect the spline fitting or contribute to the error budget .",
    "we used zeropoint , colour - correction coefficients and extinction coefficients as before , to convert our results from count rates to standard ( vegamag ) magnitudes , and then to ab magnitudes and flux densities ( table 3 ) .",
    "we estimated the errors using a monte carlo method : we created synthetic data ( 1000 sets ) based on the background model and the measured source count rates . modelling the simulated data in the same way as the real data",
    ", we obtained the photometric errors quoted in table 3 . in summary , our final result is that @xmath0 mag , @xmath1 mag , @xmath2 mag , @xmath3 mag .",
    "hlx-1 was not detected in the i band .",
    "this was not surprising , given the shorter exposure time and larger unresolved galactic contribution .",
    "we used a monte carlo technique to estimate the upper limits for the i band flux , in the following manner : we took the fitted i band background and added a fake point - like source of increasing brightness , in order to see how bright a source could be `` hidden '' for a given fitted background level and measured count rate in the source extraction region .",
    "we found that the @xmath67 and @xmath68 upper limits in the i band are @xmath69 mag and @xmath70 mag , respectively ( vegamag ) .",
    "after we had completed our photometry study of the vlt data , the set of _ hst _ images obtained and studied by @xcite became available in the public archive .",
    "we used them to re - examine our source extraction techniques , checking that there were no other point - like sources in the regions we chose for background model fitting , and testing whether hlx-1 would still be detectable when blurred to vlt resolution .",
    "we show ( figure 3 ) that our choice of background regions are indeed suitable .",
    "while hlx-1 remains easily detectable in the f390w and f555w even after smoothing to lower resolutions , regardless of the choice of region for background fitting , re - detection of the source in the psf - matched f775w image ( the closest match available to the i band ) depends strongly on background location and modelling , which introduces other sources of systematic error . moreover , the source was @xmath4 mag brighter in every band in the _ hst _ observations ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "if that applies also to the i band , we would expect that @xmath71 mag in the vlt data ; but we see from the _ hst _ f775w image that there are another two and possibly three faint sources ( marked as `` a '' , `` b '' , `` c '' in the bottom panel of figure 3 ) of comparable brightness in i ( @xmath72@xmath73 mag ) , which may contaminate the background region . such sources would make the background region brighter , and therefore we would oversubtract from the hlx-1 source counts . for these reasons , we list conservative non - detection upper limits to the i band .",
    "we stress that the other four bands with robust detections already provide the information needed for the main conclusions of our study .",

    "we double - checked our results using standard vegamag - to - abmag conversion tools . in all cases",
    ", we adopted a blackbody input spectrum at @xmath117 k for the flux density conversion ( table 3 ) , but we also calculated the flux densities in the case of a flat spectrum , a @xmath118 k blackbody , and various stellar models from o to a type .",
    "the reason we adopted @xmath117 k is that the source has blue u - b and u - v colours , and does not appear to have a balmer absorption jump typical of cooler stellar atmospheres .",
    "anyhow , in all bands except for b , the flux density at the effective wavelength of the filter ( also known as pivot wavelength ) , for a given magnitude , is essentially independent of spectral shape , within @xmath119 . there is a small dependence on spectral shape / stellar type for the b band , because the balmer jump falls at the high - frequency end of that passband .",
    "this introduces a systematic error of @xmath120 of the flux values listed for the b band in table 3 , which is in any case less than the photometric uncertainty in the measured brightness .    finally , we corrected for the optical extinction , in order to determine the true emitted luminosity and colours .",
    "as a first approximation , we took the foreground extinction @xmath121 mag ( corresponding to @xmath122 mag ) from @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is to take the maps of galactic hi from @xcite , and convert @xmath123 to an optical extinction for example through the relation of @xcite , @xmath124 ( corresponding to @xmath125 mag ) .",
    "there may be additional extinction components , intrinsic to eso243 - 49 , and in the local environment of hlx-1 . for the eso243 - 49 component",
    ", we note that the halo of an s0 galaxy dominated by stellar populations older than 1 gyr is not expected to contain much gas and dust ; indeed , it was found @xcite that the best - fitting column densities for the brightest x - ray sources in the sombrero galaxy ( an edge - on s0 galaxy similar to eso243 - 49 ) are consistent or only marginally higher than the galactic line - of - sight value .",
    "moreover , optical / x - ray studies of galactic black hole transients ( fed via roche - lobe overflow , as is likely the case in hlx-1 ) have shown @xcite that the measured optical extinction is always smaller or comparable to the value that would be inferred from the values of @xmath123 fitted to the x - ray spectra .",
    "this is because the local gas that contributes to the x - ray absorption is mostly confined to the x - ray emitting region , and/or is too hot to include a dusty component , so it does not contribute to the optical / uv absorption . in the case of hlx-1",
    ", we found from the _ swift_/xrt spectra that the total @xmath123 fitted to the x - ray source is consistent with the foreground value , or is at most twice that value ( table 4 ) .",
    "this is the same result obtained by @xcite ( total @xmath126 @xmath81 in the thermal state ) , while @xcite adopt @xmath127 @xmath81 . since we argued that the x - ray absorption provides an upper limit to the optical extinction , @xmath128 mag . in table 3",
    ", we list the top - of - the - atmosphere fluxes , those corrected with @xmath129 mag , and those for @xmath130 mag .",
    "the difference is small enough that none of our conclusions depends on the precise value of the extinction .",
    "one of our main objectives is to determine what fraction of the optical luminosity is due to re - emission of intercepted x - ray photons .",
    "thus , we have to monitor the x - ray luminosity during the epoch of our vlt observations , and compare it with x - ray and optical luminosities at other epochs .",
    "fortunately , hlx-1 has been the target of more than 100 _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) observations since 2008 october ; see nasa s heasarc data archive for a detailed logbook .",
    "we used the on - line xrt data product generator @xcite to extract light curves and spectra ( including background and ancillary response files ) ; we selected grade @xmath131@xmath132 events .",
    "we downloaded the suitable spectral response file for single and double events in photon - counting mode from the latest _ swift _ calibration database .    in 2010 november",
    ", hlx-1 was in the decline phase after the 2010 x - ray outburst . the x - ray luminosity did not change significantly between 2010 november 7 and 2010",
    "november 26 ( figure 4 ) , and the timescale for the exponential decay is much longer than 19 days .",

    "the individual _",
    "swift_/xrt observations around the two epochs are too short to allow for meaningful spectral analysis . therefore , to characterize the x - ray spectrum , we coadded all the observations in the middle part of the outburst decline , between 2010 september 30 and 2010 december 11 , a period in which the x - ray source was almost on a plateau",
    ". moreover , we coadded all _ swift_/xrt observations from 2008 october to 2011 august in which the @xmath133@xmath134 kev count rate was between 0.01 and 0.02 ct s@xmath19 .",

    "an advantage of the _ diskir _ model over widely used two - component models such as _ diskbb _ plus _ power - law _ is that the comptonized component is physically truncated at low energies , and the disk spectrum can easily be extrapolated to the optical bands , and compared with the flux from the optical counterpart .",
    "we fixed the fraction @xmath135 of luminosity in the compton tail that is thermalized in the inner disk to @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "the other irradiation parameter in the model , @xmath137 , is the fraction of bolometric flux that is thermalized in the outer disk .",

    "after measuring the optical brightness in the vlt dataset , and modelling the temperature and luminosity of the x - ray - emitting accretion disk , we shall now discuss whether the optical emission is more likely to come from the outer part of the irradiated disk , from a stellar population or from a single donor star . a comparison with the optical brightness in the _ hst _ observations @xcite provides a crucial test to distinguish between those models .",
    "the x - ray luminosity , as determined from the _ swift_/xrt count rate and spectra , was a factor of @xmath170 higher during the 2010 september 23 _ hst _ observations than during our vlt observations , taken at a later stage of the 2010 outburst decline .",

    "although the vimos filter bands are slightly different from the _ hst _ bands , this discrepancy in flux density occurs in every band and can not be explained with colour transformations ; as we are referring to the top - of - the - atmosphere flux density , this is also independent of the different choices of line - of - sight and intrinsic extinction corrections . interpolating the flux densities given by @xcite across our observed bands , we determine that the vlt flux was fainter than during the _ hst _ observations , with @xmath68 significance in each of the u , b , v and i bands , and @xmath175 significance in r. thus",

    "( the larger error in the magellan v - band measurement , which we now re - estimate as @xmath178 mag prevents firm conclusions on that band . )    on its own , our discovery of long - term optical variability correlated with the x - ray luminosity already rules out the possibility that the optical / uv counterpart was dominated by emission from an old globular cluster or a young super - star - cluster during the _ hst _ observations , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "hence , we suggest that the dominant optical / uv contribution near the outburst peak was from an irradiated accretion disk .",
    "any additional contribution from a ( constant - luminosity ) stellar population must be fainter than the luminosity determined from our vlt observations .",
    "in fact , even in our vlt data , the accretion disk is likely to give a significant contribution to the optical / uv flux , as the x - ray luminosity was still 20 times higher than in the low state , and the soft x - ray flux was still dominated by ( partly comptonized ) disk emission ( table 4 ) . in the rest of this section",
    ", we are going to discuss and constrain the possible contribution of disk and stellar populations in our vlt data .",

    "the predicted non - irradiated disk emission approximately reproduces the spectral slope between u and r but falls a factor of 3 below the observed brightnesses .",
    "clearly , irradiation of the outer disk is needed to increase the optical flux of the model without changing the x - ray luminosity .",
    "first , we assumed an irradiation fraction @xmath180 while keeping a large outer radius ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "the predicted optical flux ( solid green line in figure 6 ) is now roughly consistent with the vlt data from u to r ( although the u - v colour is too red ) , but is much too bright for the i band . as a general rule ,",
    "the optical emission of a large irradiated disk is redder than the emission of a non - irradiated disk .",
    "however , our source is significantly bluer .",
    "truncating ( or shading ) the outer edge of the disk removes some of the red emission from the outer regions , and makes the optical slope steeper .",
    "we find that the optical data are well fitted ( solid blue line in figure 6 ) with emission from the same accretion disk seen in the x - ray band , extending to @xmath181 cm , and with an intercepted and re - radiated fraction of x - ray photons @xmath182 , a very plausible value for irradiated disks in binary systems .",

    "* ) . in summary , considering that an irradiated disk was the dominant optical / uv emitter in 2010 september ( section 5.1 ) , and that the x - ray flux from the inner disk was still relatively high in 2010",
    "november , we take the irradiated disk scenario as the most likely interpretation also for the optical emission in our vlt data .",
    "+   +      an alternative possibility is that most of the optical emission in the vlt data comes from a massive star cluster surrounding the bh .",
    "for example , this is what we expect if the imbh was the nucleus of a recently accreted satellite dwarf , or was formed from core collapse in a massive star cluster .",
    "we ran instantaneous star formation simulations with @xcite to determine the expected brightness and colours of star clusters of various masses and ages ( we assumed solar metallicity for simplicity , and a kroupa initial mass function ) .",
    "here , we focus on a few representative cases .",
    "we find that a young super - star - cluster ( for example , the solid cyan line in the top panel of figure 6 represents a cluster with @xmath185 and age of 10 myr ) is inconsistent with the vlt optical data : it would have blue colours and small or no balmer jump , consistent with the observed data , but would be much too bright .",
    "this rules out one of the scenarios presented in @xcite .",
    "a young star cluster with much lower mass can match the observed optical luminosity and colours ; the solid cyan line in the bottom panel of figure 6 represents a cluster with @xmath186 and age of 5 myr .",
    "in fact , this is only an upper limit to the young cluster mass , if there is still a significant disk contribution ( section 5.2 ) .",
    "a stellar population age @xmath7 myr is required in order to match the optical colours , at solar metallicity  modulo the age - metallicity degeneracy . however , the physical interpretation of this scenario is problematic .",
    "a @xmath187 cluster is too small to harbour an imbh formed from runaway core collapse @xcite , especially one as massive as required for hlx-1 @xcite , similar to the mass of the cluster itself .",
    "its very young age makes it unlikely that the cluster could be much more massive at birth .",
    "moreover , the _ hst _ near - uv images show no other signs of ongoing or very recent , clustered star formation in the region surrounding hlx-1 , which appears like a one - off object . for all these reasons ,",
    "we conclude that the young - star - cluster scenario is much less likely than the irradiated disk scenario .",
    "old globular clusters are much fainter for a given stellar mass",
    ". a cluster with @xmath185 and age of 1 gyr would be marginally consistent with the observed b , v , r brightnesses ( solid orange line in figure 6 , middle panel ) , but totally inconsistent with the observed colour @xmath188 mag , which is typical of ob stars , and with the upper limit to the i band .",
    "intermediate - age ( @xmath189@xmath190 myr ) clusters with masses @xmath191 are a slightly better match to the b , v , r optical data but remain inconsistent with u and i ( solid magenta line in figure 6 , middle panel ) .",
    "the strongest constraint against intermediate - age and old stellar populations comes from the apparent lack of a balmer jump between b and u , in our vlt observations ; this implies that hydrogen is mostly ionized at the photosphere of the optical emitter .",
    "if the emitter is a stellar population , the lack of a balmer jump alone strongly suggests an age @xmath192 myr .",
    "we conclude that the optical counterpart of hlx-1 can not be dominated by a massive old or intermediate - age globular cluster .",
    "more complex and/or contrived theoretical scenarios can also be proposed .",
    "for example , the imbh could be located in an old , faint globular cluster ( perhaps the parent cluster that formed the imbh via core collapse in earlier epochs ) with an age @xmath193 gyr and current mass @xmath194 a few @xmath195 ( thus , satisfying the vlt luminosity constraints ) , which has recently undergone a new burst of star formation , that produced a @xmath20 young stellar population ( including perhaps the donor star to the imbh ) . or , the blue optical emission may come entirely from the imbh disk , inside an old globular cluster , and the mass donor may be an evolved low - mass star . for a globular cluster with an age of 10 gyr ,",
    "the upper mass limit consistent with the vlt data is @xmath196 ( figure 6 , bottom panel ) .",
    "such an old cluster would dominate the near - ir emission but would give a negligible contribution to the optical / uv bands , compared with the irradiated disk and/or young stellar population .",
    "we do not have enough observational data at the moment to test such multiple - component scenarios .",
    "new observations of hlx-1 during a much lower x - ray state , and in the ir , will provide conclusive tests between the irradiated disk and star cluster models , and may provide a more quantitative estimate or upper limit to the optical contribution of a stellar population around the bh .    finally , we may want to consider the possibility that the optical emission comes from the surface of an individual donor star .",
    "the inferred absolute magnitude @xmath197 mag is very high but not beyond the limit of existing stars , for example blue hypergiants and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) .",
    "stars in this luminosity range include cyg ob2 - 304 , the most luminous star known to - date in the galaxy ( @xmath198 mag : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xmath199 carinae was also at @xmath200 mag in the early 19th century , before the 1843 great eruption @xcite .",
    "as an extreme case , we modeled a standard non - irradiated disk ( based on the x - ray parameters , as in section 5.1 ) with an additional single - temperature blackbody component .",
    "we find that for @xmath201 k and a stellar radius @xmath202 cm @xmath203 , the resulting spectrum also matches the observed optical data ( figure 7 ) as well as the irradiated disk spectrum .",
    "we can not distinguish between the two cases with the scant optical data at hand .",
    "what this means is that most of the optical emission may come from a region with characteristic size @xmath204 cm and characteristic temperature @xmath205 k : either the outer radius of the irradiated ( part of the ) disk , or the irradiated face of a large , massive donor star .",
    "a scenario where the optical luminosity is dominated by a single lbv or blue hypergiant donor star implies the presence of ellipsoidal variations , due to the tidally - distorted shape of the star , and orbital modulations , due to the variable fraction of the irradiated face of the star visible to us during the orbit .",
    "the single - donor scenario may perhaps explain the outburst period @xmath16 d seen in the x - ray lightcurve @xcite , if the orbit is elongated and roche - lobe mass transfer occurs mostly at periastron , with the formation of a disk .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that the optical / uv counterpart is a single donor star , because there are no other similar objects or other evidence of exceptional star formation in the surrounding regions , within at least 1 kpc .",
    "another issue to consider is that such massive stars are shrouded in dense winds , in apparent contrast with the low column density measured from the x - ray spectra ; on the other hand , the wind may be completely ionized because of the x - ray emission from the bh .",
    "deeper optical spectra of the optical counterpart may help test between those scenarios .",
    "we observed the optical counterpart of hlx-1 with vlt vimos , in 2010 november , when the x - ray source was in an intermediate state , declining after the 2010 august outburst .",
    "we found the following brightness values in the standard vegamag system : @xmath0 mag ; @xmath1 mag ; @xmath2 mag ; @xmath3 mag . in the abmag system , this corresponds to @xmath206 mag , @xmath207 mag , @xmath208 mag , @xmath209 mag .",
    "we do not detect the source in the i band ( @xmath210 mag ) ; this was expected because the i band had the shortest exposure time and the largest galactic contamination .",
    "we found that the optical / uv brightnesses in every band are @xmath4 mag fainter than in the _ hst _ observations from 2010 september , at a time when the x - ray flux was a factor of 2 higher .",
    "this rules out the scenario @xcite that the optical source seen in the _ hst _ observations was dominated by a massive star cluster , because in that case its brightness would not have changed .",
    "it strongly suggests that the optical counterpart was dominated by an irradiated accretion disk .    from the vlt data alone , we can not tell whether the optical emission was still dominated by an irradiated disk , or by a stellar population : optical observations at even lower x - ray flux levels will test these alternatives .",
    "we can , however , constrain the maximum stellar mass and age of the stellar population that can be consistent with the observed vlt luminosities and colours .",
    "we found that they are consistent with a young stellar population of mass @xmath20 and age @xmath211 myr .",
    "this immediately rules out a young super - star - cluster , which would have similar blue colours and lack of a balmer jump , but would be much too luminous .",
    "if there is an old globular cluster around hlx-1 , as previously speculated @xcite , it may dominate the near - ir bands , but it can not give a significant contribution to the observed optical / uv flux discussed in this work .",
    "we estimate that a 10-gyr - old globular cluster must have a mass @xmath9 to be consistent with the vlt data . by comparison with the current models and observational mass limits on imbh candidates in old globular clusters ( table 1 in",
    "* ) , we argue that a host cluster mass @xmath196 may be just high enough at least to allow for the possibility of a central imbh with a mass @xmath8 , as suggested by x - ray modelling @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "we attribute most of the optical / uv emission to an irradiated disk , as the simplest scenario consistent with all the data at hand .",
    "the more complex scenario of a very old globular cluster with a small burst of recent star formation is also acceptable , but requires more observational data to be tested .",
    "we modelled the x - ray spectrum around the time of the vlt observations ( when @xmath212 erg s@xmath19 ) , and during epochs of similar levels of x - ray luminosity in previous years .",
    "we showed that an irradiated disk can explain the observed optical luminosity and colours , with a plausible reprocessing fraction @xmath6 , typical of irradiated disks in x - ray binaries .",
    "regardless of any details on disk structure and irradiation , if the optical emission is thermal , during the vlt observations it comes from a region with characteristic size @xmath204 cm and characteristic temperature @xmath213 k ; this could be the size and temperature of the irradiated outer disk .",
