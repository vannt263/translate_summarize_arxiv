    "in 1998 , two supernovae teams discovered that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite . from that time on , a flood of models have been presented to explain the accelerated expansion phase . for the reviews about the accelerated expansion and dark energy , please see @xcite .",
    "a natural candidate to dark energy is the cosmological constant ( cc ) which was first introduced by einstein to realize a static universe about a century ago . in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) ,",
    "cc has relations with the vacuum or zero point energy density of quantum fields , via @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a uv cut - off . to balance an assumed uv cut - off @xmath5 and the observational smallness of cc",
    ", tremendous fine tuning is required .",
    "this is the so - called cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "qft in curved space - time leads to an infinite effective action or vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensors of the fields .",
    "a renormalization treatment can yield a scale - dependent or running cc and a running newton constant .",
    "though , the absolute values can not be calculated , the change with respect to the renormalization scale can be calculated via renormalization group equations ( rges ) originating in qft @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite . in the cosmological context",
    ", it is reasonable to identify the renormalization scale with some characteristic scales of cosmology .",
    "the related investigation can be found in @xcite , where the renormalization scale @xmath6 was given by the hubble scale @xmath7 , the inverse radius @xmath8 of the cosmological event horizon and the inverse radius @xmath9 of the particle horizon .",
    "another interesting viewpoints about the relations between vacuum energy density and a cosmological scale come from the so - called holographic principle in cosmology . according to the holographic principle",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary . by applying the principle to cosmology",
    ", one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the universe . for a system with size @xmath10 and uv cut - off @xmath5 without decaying into a black hole ,",
    "it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath10 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath11 .",
    "the largest @xmath10 allowed is the one saturating this inequality , thus @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a numerical constant and @xmath14 is the reduced planck mass @xmath15 .",
    "it just means a _ duality _ between uv cut - off and ir cut - off .",
    "the uv cut - off is related to the vacuum energy , and ir cut - off is related to the large scale of the universe , for example hubble horizon , event horizon or particle horizon as discussed by @xcite . then in this context the so - called fine tuning problem is removed naturally .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the author proposed a dark energy model , dubbed holographic dark energy ( hde ) , where the future event horizon @xmath16 was taken as the ir cut - off @xmath10 .",
    "this horizon is the boundary of the volume a fixed observer may eventually observe .",
    "one is to formulate a theory regarding a fixed observer within this horizon . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", it can reveal the dynamic nature of the vacuum energy and provide a solution to the _ fine tuning _ and _ cosmic coincidence _ problem .",
    "the concrete value of parameter @xmath13 is very important to determine the properties of hde .",
    "for example in the epoch when the hde becomes to dominate the energy density , i.e. @xmath17 , if @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respected , the hde behaves like quintessence , cosmological constant and phantom respectively .",
    "one can clearly see that in the following eq .",
    "( [ eq : deeos ] ) by setting @xmath21 . in the past years",
    ", the hde model was confronted with cosmic observations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used the angular scale of the acoustic oscillation from the boomrange and wmap data on cmb to constrain hde model .",
    "also the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the cmb shift parameter @xmath22 to constrain hde model .",
    "for the recent result please see @xcite where the best fit value of parameter @xmath23 in @xmath24 region was given .",
    "in that paper , about the cmb information only the cmb shift parameter @xmath22 , acoustic scale @xmath25 and the redshift @xmath26 at the decoupling epoch of photons obtained from wmap-7yr in @xmath5cdm model were employed .",
    "the main problem comes from the fact that the values of the cmb shift parameters used in the literature for example @xcite , depend on the cosmological model , here the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "so , when one uses these derived data points to constrain other cosmological models , the so - called circular problem , i.e. dependence on cosmological models , would be committed .",
    "and the circular problem is what we try to avoid in the cosmological constraint issue .",
    "therefore one should constrain the cosmological model in a consistent way by using cosmic observational data points which do not depend on any cosmological model .",
    "however to use full cmb data sets from wmap7-yr to constrain the hde model is still missing in the literature . in this paper to fill up the gap , we will use the full information from wmap-7yr data sets in stead of cmb shift parameters .",
    "furthermore , the cmb shift parameters contain information around the last scattering surface of background photons where the contribution from dark energy may not be neglected as cc case due to a nontrivial equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy , for example early dark energy model @xcite . in this situation",
    ", it is dangerous to use theses derived data points from @xmath5cdm model to constrain other cosmological model due to much departure from @xmath5cdm model . at late epoch when the dark energy dominates , the gravitational potentials decay and the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) arises .",
    "it affects to the anisotropy power spectra of cmb at large scale ( low @xmath27 parts ) .",
    "the isw effect is sensitive to the properties of dark energy .",
    "apparently , the late isw effect is not expressed by the cmb shift parameters .",
    "so one can expect a tight constraint to cosmological model parameter space when the late isw effect is included .",
    "base on these points mentioned above , in this paper we will not use the derived cmb shift parameters but the full information from wmap-7yr data points to constrain the hde model .",
    "the important is that there does nt exist any circular problem . due to the full information from wmap-7yr",
    "is used , one can expect to obtain a tight constraint . at low redshift regions , the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) are also included as geometric measures .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : bgpe ] , we give a brief review of the hde model where the radiation is included and the future event horizon adopted as an ir cut - off .",
    "the scalar perturbation evolution equations for a spatially flat frw universe will also be presented . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , the constraint methodology and results will be presented .",
    "we give a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "now , as is done in @xcite , the event horizon @xmath28 taken as the ir cut - off . then , the hde is written as @xmath29 and the friedmann equation in a spatially flat frw universe can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 are dimensionless energy densities for radiation , baryon , cold dark matter and hde respectively . for convenience ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath32 has been normalized to @xmath33 .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehhde ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eh ] ) , one has @xmath34 where the definition of dimensionless energy density parameter for hde is used . from eq.([eq :",
    "ehfe ] ) , one obtains @xmath35 inserting the above equation into eq .",
    "( [ eq : re ] ) , one has @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "taking derivative with respect to @xmath39 from both sides of the above equation , one has the differential equation of @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "this equation with initial condition @xmath43 describes the evolution of dimensionless energy density of dark energy .",
    "then the background evolution will be obtained by solving this differential equation and friedmann equation . when the baryon and radiation components are omitted , one has @xmath44 .",
    "then the evolution equation for @xmath45 @xcite @xmath46 is recovered . from the conservation equation of the hde @xmath47",
    ", one has the equation of state ( eos ) of holographic dark energy @xmath48 where @xmath49 .    in this paper , we take the hde as a perfect fluid having eos ( [ eq : deeos ] ) . considering the perturbation in the synchronous gauge and the conservation of energy - momentum tensor @xmath50 , one has the perturbation equations of density contrast and velocity divergence for the hde @xmath51 following the notations of ma and bertschinger @xcite . for the gauge ready formalism about the perturbation theory , please see @xcite . for the hde",
    ", we assume the shear perturbation @xmath52 . in our calculations , the adiabatic initial conditions will be taken .",
    "before constraining the model parameter space , we study the effects of model parameter @xmath13 to the cmb power spectrum by setting different values of @xmath13 and fixing the other relevant cosmological model parameters . at fist",
    ", we modify the camb package @xcite , which is the code for calculating the cmb power spectrum and is publicly available , to include the hde .",
    "the differential equation ( [ eq : diffeq ] ) was solved by taking @xmath53 as initial condition .",
    "we borrow and fix the other relevant cosmological parameters values from wmap7 , the resultant cmb power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] for different values of @xmath13 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are fixed .",

    "multiple moment @xmath27 and the corresponding ratio to @xmath5cdm model for different values of model parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are fixed .",
    "the main difference appears at low ( @xmath58 ) multipole momentum parts which correspond to large scale.,width=529 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] , one can see that the main contribution to cmb power spectra from the hde comes from the evolution of eos and its domination at the late epoch through late isw effect . at early epoch",
    "the contribution to cmb power spectra is small due to small energy density ratio of the hde , that can be understood from the eos of the hde ( [ eq : deeos ] ) which seems close to @xmath59 before the last scattering surface .",
    "it means that a tight constraint would be obtained when cmb information from large scale is included .",
    "but unfortunately , the cmb data points are dominated by the so - called cosmic variance at large scale , i.e. low @xmath27 part .",
    "we perform a global fitting to the model parameter space by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we modified publicly available * cosmomc * package @xcite to include the hde in the camb @xcite code which is used to calculate the theoretical cmb power spectrum .",

    "furthermore , the hard coded prior on the comic age @xmath77 is also imposed .",
    "also , the physical baryon density @xmath78 @xcite from big bang nucleosynthesis and new hubble constant @xmath79 @xcite are adopted .    to get the distribution of parameters ,",

    "sn ia is used as standard candle .",
    "and bao is used as standard ruler . at the last scattering of cmb radiation ,",
    "the acoustic oscillation in the baryon - photon fluid was frozen and imprinted their signature on the matter distribution .",
    "the characterized scale of bao in the observed galaxy power spectrum is determined by the comoving sound horizon at drag epoch @xmath84 which is shortly after photon decoupling and defined as the redshift at which the drag optical depth @xmath85 equals one . to calculate @xmath86",
    ", one needs to know the redshift @xmath84 at the drag epoch and its corresponding sound horizon .",
    "the baryon drag epoch redshift @xmath84 can be obtained from its definition and be calculated numerically @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath90 is the fraction of free electrons .",

    "when the worst e - values [ the variance(mean)/mean(variance ) of 1/2 chains ] @xmath100 is of the order @xmath101 , the global fitting results are summarized in table [ tab : results ] and figure [ fig : contour ] .",
