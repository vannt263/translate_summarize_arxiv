    "it is an old problem to find a formula for the casson - walker invariant of cyclic branched covers of a knot . for two - fold branched covers , mullins used skein theory of the jones polynomial to show that for all knots @xmath0 in @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is a , there is a linear relation between @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the logarithmic derivative of the jones polynomial of @xmath0 at @xmath11 , @xcite .",
    "a different approach was taken by the first author in @xcite , where the above mentioned linear relation was deduced and explained from the wider context of s of knots and 3-manifolds .",
    "for @xmath12 , hoste , davidow and ishibe studied a partial case of the above problem for whitehead doubles of knots , @xcite .",
    "however , a general formula was missing for @xmath13 .",
    "since the map @xmath14 is not a concordance invariant of @xmath6 , it follows that a formula for the casson invariant of cyclic branched coverings should involve more than just the _ total @xmath4- _",
    "@xmath15 ( that is , @xmath16 ) .    in @xcite , a conjecture for the casson invariant of cyclic",
    "branched coverings was formulated .",
    "the conjecture involved the total signature and the sums over complex roots of unity , of a _ rational function _ associated to a knot .",
    "the rational function in question was the 2-loop part of a rational lift @xmath17 of the kontsevich integral of a knot .",
    "in @xcite the authors constructed this rational lift , combining the so - called _ surgery view of knots _ ( see @xcite ) with the full aparatus of perturbative field theory , formulated by the aarhus integral and its function - theory properties .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to prove the missing formula of the casson invariant of cyclic branched coverings , under the mild assumption that these are rational homology spheres .",
    "in fact , our methods will give a formula for the lmo invariant of cyclic branched coverings in terms of the  function and residues of the @xmath17 invariant .    our main theorem [ thm.1 ]",

    "since the universal abelian cover maps onto every cyclic branched cover , it is not too surprising that the @xmath17 invariant appears in a formula for the lmo invariant of cyclic branched covers .",
    "the presence of the signature function is a framing defect of the branched covers .",
    "it arises because we need to normalize the 3-manifold invariants by their values at a @xmath25-framed unknot .",
    "these values are some universal constants , whose ratio ( for positively versus negatively unit framed unknot ) is given by the signature term .",
