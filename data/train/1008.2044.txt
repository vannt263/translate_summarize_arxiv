    "recently there has been considerable interest in studying casimir effect in randall - sundrum brane models @xcite . a number of works @xcite have been done from various perspective such as brane stabilization , effective potential , strength of casimir force , stress energy tensor , etc .",
    "the pioneering work of casimir @xcite shows that there is an attractive force of magnitude @xmath2 acting between two parallel perfectly conducting plates with area @xmath3 and separation distance @xmath4 . in the last thirty years",
    ", a number of spacetime models with extra dimensions were proposed to solve different fundamental problems in physics .",
    "the prevalence of spacetimes with extra dimensions has motivated research on possible correction to casimir force acting between parallel plates due to the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "casimir effect on parallel plates in kaluza - klein spacetime and randall - sundrum spacetime were studied in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "majority of these works considered scalar field instead of electromagnetic field since scalar field is much more easier to deal with . in @xcite , electromagnetic field",
    "were considered but using the scalar field  electromagnetic field analogy that works in minskowski spacetime . to yield the correct limit when the size of the extra dimension goes to zero ,",
    "it was claimed that for the part corresponding to casimir effect in 4@xmath5 , the casimir energy due to electromagnetic field is twice the casimir energy due to scalar field ; whereas for the part corresponding to kaluza - klein excitations , the casimir energy due to electromagnetic field is three times the casimir energy due to scalar field .",
    "however , it is quite dubious whether such simple relation with scalar field holds especially for warped models .",
    "one of the reasons is that the kaluza - klein mode masses for scalar field and electromagnetic field are in general different .",
    "another reason is that the perfectly conducting condition for @xmath1 massless photons has different generalizations to higher dimensional massless photons and to @xmath1 massive photons . for simple kaluza - klein models such as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the 4@xmath5 minkowski spacetime , the scalar field ",
