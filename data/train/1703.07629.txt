    "<S> hence it gives a weak topological insulator in two dimensions , with even number of spin - polarized boundary states . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is analogous to the quantum spin - hall state , except here the time - reversal polarization is spatially modulated , and thus it is dubbed quantum spin - hall density wave ( qshdw ) state . </S>",
    "<S> this order parameter can be realized or engineered in quantum wires , or quasi-2d systems , by tuning the spin - orbit couping strength and chemical potential to achieve the special nesting condition .    </S>",
    "<S> a topological state of matter can arise when two bands with opposite chirality are inverted across the fermi level at odd number of time - reversal ( tr ) invariant momenta ( trim).@xcite one of the prerequisites is thus to obtain a momentum dependence of the spin state or chirality , which is often triggered by the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inversion of the chirality between the bulk conduction and valence bands across the insulating band gap at the trim is protected by the tr symmetry , leading to a @xmath0 topological insulator ( ti ) . at the boundary , </S>",
    "<S> both chiral states meet at the trim with gapless edge or surface states . within the dirac hamiltonian notation </S>",
    "<S> , the inverted bulk band gap ( denoted by @xmath5 ) at the trim provides the negative dirac mass , while the associated gapless boundary states .    </S>",
    "<S> while strong quantum fluctuations or disorder are often detrimental to the band topology , they can conversely drive the inversion of the chiral bands with non - trivial topological properties . </S>",

    "<S> _ proposal : _ we develop the theory of a landau - type topological order parameter driven by staggered chiral band inversion . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter arises from the translational symmetry breaking due to fermi surface ( fs ) nesting between rashba - type soc ( rsoc ) split bands . </S>",
    "<S> such nesting between opposite chiral states may occur in 2d systems or quantum wires of bi , pb , sb , and similar elements in which both soc and interaction are large.@xcite the nesting strength is enhanced with reduced system dimensionality and thickness.@xcite our theory relies on a particular nesting vector @xmath7 or @xmath8 , where the helicity of the rsoc @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 being the rsoc strength , and @xmath11 are the crystal momenta ) is reversed to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the key feature responsible for modulated chiral band inversion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as a landau type order parameter develops due to this fs instability , it leads to a negative dirac mass and insulating band gap . along the direction of the nesting </S>",
    "<S> , we find that correlated electronic bands are associated with non - trivial @xmath13 invariant , with spin - polarized zero - energy boundary states . </S>",
    "<S> such a state can be compared with a non - interacting qsh insulator in 2d , with the distinction that here every alternative atoms possess opposite chirality in the same valence band , owing to translational symmetry breaking , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we call it a quantum spin - hall density wave ( qshdw ) insulator </S>",
    "<S> .    _ theory of qshdw : _ to develop the theory of qshdw , we use a single band tight - binding model in a 2d lattice with rsoc . </S>",
    "<S> the fs nesting is generally known to increase as the dimensionality is reduced . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , we use anisotropic tight - binding hoppings along the @xmath14- and @xmath15-directions ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , so that the nesting at the wavevector @xmath18 or @xmath8 can be monitored by changing the ratio @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the concept and formalism of the qshdw is general for any dimension as long as the corresponding nesting wavevector allows for the chirality inversion at all given dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we use a tight - binding dispersion with nearest neighbor hopping as @xmath20 -\\xi_{\\rm f}$ ] , where @xmath21 is the chemical potential , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the lattice constants along the @xmath14- and @xmath15-directions , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> , one may expect that a luttinger liquid theory might be more appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimentally it is demonstrated that at finite temperature and in the presence of impurity scattering , the quantitative difference between the luttinger liquid and fermi liquid behavior is small and often undetectable.@xcite therefore , a fermi liquid like physics with mean - field order parameter can be used here . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the weak coupling region , quantum fluctuations are fermi liquid like , i.e. it scales quadratically with energy . </S>",
    "<S> such weak fluctuations only become appreciable near the quantum critical regime where the gap becomes small . away from the critical region , </S>",

    "<S> , some parts of the fs ( which are not nested by @xmath25 ) remain ungapped for small values of @xmath79 ( topological invariant may still be defined for the cases with small fs pockets , giving rise to qshdw semimetals ) . with larger @xmath79 , insulating gap appears . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](a - b ) dictates the electronic weight associated with the main bands ( thickness of the line corresponds to the contribution from first reduced bz ( rbz ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the main and shadow bands possess different spin - orbit chirality ( due to @xmath81 ) , the emergence of qshdw order is naturally accompanied by chirality inversion at the trs momenta . in the present qshdw theory , due to non - collinearity of the spin coming from the soc , the spin expectation value of two different bands at each sublattice cancels each other , and thus the system presenves tr symmetry .    _ </S>",

    "<S> _ for the calculation of topological invariants in single particle picture ( also applicable to mean field electronic bands ) , kane and mele proposed the concept of ` tr polarization ' . </S>",
    "<S> this is a z@xmath82 analog of the charge polarization for integer quantum hall state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tr polarization depends on the number of times an electron exchanges its ` tr partner ' between its bloch state , @xmath83 , and its tr conjugate @xmath84 in half of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> this is essentially quantified by the pfaffian of a matrix with components @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the complex conjugate operator ) is the tr operator , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are valence band indices . </S>",
    "<S> relative sign of pf[@xmath90 between any two tr invariant k - points becomes opposite if the electron switches its tr partner odd number of times in traversing between them . </S>",

    "<S> as @xmath93 , the residue theory dictates that @xmath94 . if there are odd number of @xmath95 , one obtains @xmath94 ( modulo 2 ) , otherwise , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> according to kane - mele criterion , there are three @xmath0 invariants in 2d : ( @xmath97:@xmath98 ) , where @xmath97 is the net @xmath0 invariant giving a strong topological insulator , while @xmath99 are the weak topological invariants representing odd number of band inversions along the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions , respectively .    in the present 1d case , the chirality or the tr polarizibility is reversed along the direction of the nesting . for both singlet and triplet cases , </S>",
    "<S> we find that pf[@xmath100 changes sign when going from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , and it vanishes at @xmath103 , but not in the perpendicular directions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the system possess a strong @xmath0 topological invariant ( @xmath104 ) along this direction ( in 1d ) , but a weak topological insulator in 2d with invariants ( 0:10 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we show the spectrum of the interacting quasi-1d qshdw in a strip geometry ( inset ) . ]    _ boundary state . _ due to the bulk boundary correspondence , non - trivial @xmath0 invariant implies the existence of zero energy edge states as long as the tr symmetry is held . </S>",
    "<S> the present system resembles a su - schrieffer - heeger  @xcite type model in 1d if we map the two atoms with opposite chirality in larger unit cell as two sublattices . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the topological invariant in the bulk dictates a single end state inside the gap . </S>",

    "<S> 1d soc is recently observed in optical lattice , where our idea can also be explored with the existing setups . from theoretical perspective , </S>",
    "<S> the generalization of the proposed topological phase to higher dimensional fs with the same nesting condition along all directions is possible . </S>",
    "<S> for example , non - centrosymmetric heavy - fermion materials would be potential candidates to explore large soc an interaction . </S>",
