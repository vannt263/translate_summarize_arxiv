    "<S> there is an important feature of this correlation function that makes the markov solution qualitatively incomplete : while the sine integral si is analytic , the cosine integral ci(s ) behaves like @xmath103 for @xmath104@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the exact solutions @xmath106 have extra analytic structure not present in the markov approximation , and the real - time dynamics @xmath107 has qualitatively different features in addition to the pole contributions we have just discussed .    the @xmath67 branch point in @xmath105 leads the kernels @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 to have branch points at @xmath111 ; the kernels @xmath112 and @xmath113 have three branch points , at @xmath67 and @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the solutions to the gme @xmath114 also have three branch points in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> we find by numerical study that the exact solutions still have four poles as before , which , for small @xmath1 , have nearly ( but not exactly ) the same pole positions and residues as in the markov approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the structure of the solutions in the complex @xmath68 plane is as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> the locations of the branch cuts are chosen for computational convenience , as discussed shortly . </S>",
    "<S> given this branch - cut structure , the inverse laplace transform ( the bromwich integral ) is evaluated by closing the contour as shown . </S>",

    "<S> the closed - contour integral in the expression can be written as a sum over the four poles , and so gives complex exponential contributions to the solution as in the markovian case . </S>",
    "<S> the extra terms , the sum over the three branch cuts , are new and give qualitatively different features . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the second and third branch cuts are complex conjugates of each other , so we will discuss them together as the  </S>",
    "<S> branch cut 2 \" (  bc2 \" for short ) contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the first cut will be discussed as the  bc1 \" contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of these cuts to the solution is independent of the detailed positioning of the branch cuts , so long as they are not moved across a pole ; the choice of the direction of bc1 is a computational convenience  the apparently most natural choice of this cut direction , along the negative real axis , passes it essentially on top of the @xmath62 pole , making the evaluation of the branch - cut integral numerically inconvenient . as a check , we find that the results we discuss now are indeed independent of the cut direction .    we have done a detailed study of these branch - cut contributions for @xmath127 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1]b for the choice of parameters shown , has the following features : @xmath132 is negative for all @xmath2 , it is monotonically increasing , and its long - time behavior is @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> also , @xmath134 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us survey , then , the peculiar features that this branch cut contribution introduces into the time response @xmath135 . visualizing the @xmath128 spin - boson model as a symmetric double </S>",
    "<S> well system coupled to its environment , the bc1 piece being negative means that , if the system is initially in the left well , it will , in the course of coherently tunnelling back and forth , spend more time in the _ right _ well ! this effect becomes strongest at long time , much longer than @xmath4 , for in this regime the pole contributions are exponentially small , while the bc1 contribution decays like a power law . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it may be hard to see the effect in this regime ( on account of finite - temperature effects , for example ) , so it is important to note that this memory effect appears already at early times , indicating that already in the first couple of coherent oscillations , there will be an excess amplitude in the right - well excursions as compared with the left - well excursions , by an amount proportional to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe , on the basis of a variety of evidence@xcite , that the born approximation should be reliable up to @xmath1 s of order @xmath136 ; thus , experiments that look at coherent oscillations accurately at the percent level ( which , it seems , will ultimately be necessary for performing quantum computation ) could readily see this bc1 effect .    </S>",
    "<S> we note several other interesting features of our solution for @xmath128 . taking into account the non - markovian effects </S>",
    "<S> , we can do a more precise calculation of the pole positions and residues ( only poles 3 and 4 contribute ) . </S>",

    "<S> this would be impossible in a markovian theory , in which @xmath146 , so that @xmath147 would be exactly 1 to all orders in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this excess pole residue is exactly what is needed to cancel out the initial value of the bc1 contribution to @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our results for the residues differ from the weak - coupling expressions in the literature@xcite ( we are not aware of prior reports on @xmath148 ) .    for the biased model ( @xmath149 ) the bc2 contributions become nonzero ; we find that they give other peculiar non - exponential corrections to the solution @xmath135 , very different from the bc1 contribution . </S>",

    "<S> we give a few final remarks about the bc2 calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute size of the bc2 contribution reaches a maximum near the value of @xmath184 used in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ; the relative size of this contribution continues to increase as @xmath185 increases , so that it eventually becomes much larger than the pole contribution ( but all contributions to @xmath135 go to zero as @xmath186 ) . </S>",

    "<S> deficit _ in the total pole contribution , that is , @xmath188 . even in the absence of an explicit branch cut computation </S>",
    "<S> , this deficit signals the prompt loss of coherence , in that it indicates that the exponentially decaying contributions to @xmath135 do no account for all the coherence near @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is opposite to the unbiased case , where , as a result of the bc1 part , there is an _ excess _ pole contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally , many more regimes could be studied using the present approach . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been interest in varying both the system@xcite and bath@xcite initial conditions , as well as in varying the model of the bath density of states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all these circumstances , the systematic born expansion procedure we report here can be done . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear on general grounds that the appearance of branch cut contributions will not be restricted to the ohmic model we have studied in detail here ; it is easy to show that for any spectral density of the form @xmath189 at low frequencies ( @xmath190 ) , @xmath191 will have a power - law dependence at long time , and thus @xmath105 will have a branch point at @xmath67 . </S>",

    "<S> our hope is that , using the present and further exact calculations of the weak - coupling behavior of the spin - boson model , a tool will be made available to permit precision experiments to test the validity of the model ( which , at present , is only phenomenologically justified ) in various physical situations of present interest in quantum information </S>",
