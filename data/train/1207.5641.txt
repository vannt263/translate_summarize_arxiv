    "eq.([eq : cpt ] ) is a strong coupling perturbation theory result and holds up to first order in the inter - cluster hopping @xmath33 , as far as the self - energy is concerned . as a consequence , the self - energy @xmath34 of the total system is approximated by the self - energy of the initial system @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that ncpt / nvca become exact in the non - interacting limit , since in this case , the self - energy of the total system agrees with that of the initial system , which are both zero .",
    "the results of ncpt and nvca converge towards the exact results with increasing cluster size .",
    "+ in the present paper we illustrate this approach for the siam out of equilibrium .",
    "we start out by splitting the infinite chain ( eq.([eq : hsiam ] ) ) into three parts : i ) an interacting central region of length @xmath36 consisting of the interacting site ( the quantum dot ) as well as an equal amount of sites of the left and the right leads , ii ) a semi - infinite , non - interacting left region consisting of the remaining part of the left lead and iii ) a semi - infinite , non - interacting right region consisting of the remaining part of the right lead ( see fig.[fig : model ] ) . to proceed , the single - particle green s functions in keldysh space have to be determined exactly for those three systems .",
    "results for the left and right part are available analytically by the retarded green s function of a semi - infinite tight binding chain  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the retarded green s function of the infinite tight binding chain .",
    "the single - particle green s function of the central interacting region can be determined in the q - matrix formalism by the band - lanczos algorithm ( see ref .   and ref .  ) .",
    "the advanced component can always be obtained by the relation @xmath39 . before coupling the three subsystems at time @xmath40 ,",
    "each of them is in equilibrium at different chemical potentials @xmath41 .",
    "therefore we may evaluate the corresponding keldysh components by the relation  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the fermi - dirac distribution function at inverse temperature @xmath44 : @xmath45 .",
    "in the zero temperature limit , @xmath46 may be re - expressed as @xmath47 .",
    "this is the only expression in which the chemical potential @xmath48 enters .",
    "it is crucial that this relation does not hold in a non - equilibrium situation any longer .",
    "the hermitian part of @xmath49 is zero in equilibrium .",
    "the imaginary part consists of contributions due to delta peaks for finite size systems like the central regions .",
    "the operator @xmath33 just contains the two hopping terms from the left to the central and from the central to the right region . at time @xmath28 , the hopping processes between these three regions are switched on and the steady - state single - particle green s function @xmath23 is determined using ncpt , eq.([eq : cpt ] ) . as in the equilibrium case ,",
    "the cpt results can be improved by the variational cluster approach , in which the single - particle part of the initial system is suitably modified . in the following a variational extension ( nvca ) of the scheme described above",
    "will be presented following ref .  .",
    "+      the idea of enlarging the size of the central region in ncpt is to find a better approximation for the starting point of perturbation theory .",
    "as pointed out before , in cpt the self - energy of the total system is approximated by that of the decoupled system . by increasing the size of the central region",
    ", the self - energy of the decoupled system converges gradually towards that of the total system . in nvca",
    "an even more suitable initial system is chosen .",
    "this can be achieved by making use of the fact that the decomposition of @xmath24 into clusters @xmath26 and inter - cluster parts @xmath33 is not unique .",
    "we are free to add single - particle operators @xmath50 , which depend linearly on parameters @xmath51 , to the initial hamiltonian @xmath26 , provided we subtract them again from @xmath33 @xmath52 here , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is quadratic in the fermion operators .",
    "this parametrized single - particle field introduces additional freedom in the starting guess for perturbation theory and can be used for a self - consistent feedback on the clusters .",
    "the system described by @xmath55 , usually referred to as reference system in the context of vca , has the same structure as in equilibrium vca . the condition to fix the single - particle parameters @xmath51 , however , is different in nvca and vca .",
    "equilibrium vca is based on the self - energy functional approach ( sfa )  @xcite and provides a variational principle for the generalized grand potential functional , which is not well defined in the context of non - equilibrium systems any longer .",
    "an alternative criterion for fixing the variational parameters @xmath51 was introduced in ref .   and compared to the traditional vca criterion in ref .  .",
    "it is based on the idea of starting from a system which is as similar as possible to the total , original system in terms of physically observable quantities .",
    "we demand the expectation values of the operators @xmath54 to coincide in the initial ( reference ) system and the steady - state of the total system , i.e. @xmath56 for example , adding variational freedom in the on - site energy of the quantum dot , corresponding to @xmath57 yields the self - consistency condition : @xmath58 . from a more conceptual point of view , it is interesting that these self - consistency conditions follow from the condition  @xcite @xmath59 which is closely related to the stationarity condition of the generalized grand potential functional @xmath60 in the equilibrium approach  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath61 is a pauli matrix in keldysh space and the subscript zero denotes non - interacting green s functions . from the numerical point of view , one has to find the roots of an n - dimensional set of non - linear equations ( where n is the number of variational parameters @xmath51 ) . + like in first order dirac perturbation theory ,",
    "the influence of the perturbation increases with time ( perturbations introduced due to the coupling with hopping elements @xmath10 at @xmath28 are proportional to @xmath62 since we are considering first order perturbation theory ) and one might argue that ncpt is bound to fail in the long - time , steady - state limit , even for small couplings between the clusters  @xcite",
    ". this argument can not be true in general , as ncpt yields exact results in the case of non - interacting particles , although the initial decoupled systems are far from the steady - state behavior .",
    "+ the initial system in ncpt is independent of the non - equilibrium situation and this shortcoming is improved to some extent within nvca , where the information about the applied bias voltage is self - consistently fed back to the initial reference system . as we will see in this paper , there are circumstances under which ncpt already yields reasonable results . in general , however , we observe that nvca represents a significant improvement over ncpt .",
    "this implies , on the one hand , that under steady - state conditions , the self - energy in the central cluster is significantly modified when going from ncpt to nvca . on the other hand",
    ", it indicates that the steady - state situation can be mimicked in an equilibrium system by the auxiliary one - particle terms , determined self - consistently .",
    "a point for improvement of this approach is to modify the self - energy so that it is a genuine non - equilibrium one .",
    "+ details on the nvca procedure and the particular choice of variational parameters are provided in app .",
    "[ app : nvca ] .",
    "in the following we compare ncpt and nvca data for the steady - state current with tebd  @xcite and qmc  @xcite results in the particle - hole symmetric model .",
    "we elaborate on the non - equilibrium density of states and finally discuss results for the steady - state current away from particle - hole symmetry by applying a gate voltage .",
    "earlier preliminary results obtained for the siam out of equilibrium by ncpt and nvca are available in ref .   and ref .  .",
    "+      here we investigate the steady - state current - voltage characteristics of the particle - hole symmetric siam . in this parameter region ,",
    "kondo correlations are especially important .",
    "all ncpt and nvca results are for an infinite system using a self - energy based on an @xmath63 site interacting reference system .",
    "although the length of kondo correlations scales exponentially in interaction strength , it has been shown in ref .   that the vca approximation , similarly to other approximate methods such as frg or gutzwiller wave functions , is capable of retaining qualitatively most features of the ongoing kondo physics , although , possibly , with renormalized scales .",
    "the steady - state current can be evaluated on any link either within the central region or between the central and the neighboring regions , since we find that the continuity equation is fulfilled within at least @xmath64 relative to the steady - state current amplitude .",
    "we note again that in the non - interacting case ncpt as well as nvca become exact so we do not show these data explicitly .",
    "+        results obtained by eq.([eq : sscurrent ] ) for the ncpt case are shown in the left column of fig.[fig : sscurrent ] for various values of the interaction strength @xmath6 . the linear response result @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the conductance quantum , is fulfilled within ncpt ( and nvca ) in the very low bias region .",
    "this is because these methods fulfill the friedel sum rule in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "actually , ncpt tends to stay in the linear response regime longer than nvca and therefore overestimates the current for low ( but not very low ) bias voltages .",
    "we model the leads by one dimensional tight binding chains , yielding a semi - circular density of states ( eq.([eq : envgf ] ) ) of bandwidth @xmath21 .",
    "this implies a vanishing current in the high bias limit at @xmath67 , due to non - overlapping lead density of states .",
    "this limit again is trivially fulfilled within ncpt and nvca .",
    "note that in a wide band limit the current curves would approach a constant roughly at their respective maxima in the data shown .",
    "+ for comparison , numerically exact results  @xcite as obtained by a real - time evolution with tebd are also indicated in fig.[fig : sscurrent ] .",
    "note that the tebd data are obtained from the steady - state plateau in the time dependence of the current . at small and medium bias ,",
    "the current converges well and the tebd results provide an accurate benchmark . at higher bias ,",
    "convergence is low , but the tebd data still provide a reasonably reliable upper bound for the steady - state current . + in the intermediate bias region it is interesting to investigate the behavior of ncpt with increasing size of the central region @xmath36 . as can be seen from the plots , for any interaction strength increasing @xmath36 yields monotonically improving results .",
    "while for low interaction strength @xmath68 the ncpt results almost coincide with the tebd data , greater deviations arise at higher interaction strengths . for very large interaction strength",
    "( see for example @xmath69 ) , the lengths of the central region @xmath36 considered here are not sufficient . at high bias voltage",

    "@xcite in the wide - band limit are available .",
    "one aspect to note immediately is that nvca , like tebd , departs sooner than ncpt from the linear response data , which is due to the better reproduction of the kondo resonance within nvca .",
    "the thinning of this narrow resonance at zero bias with increasing interaction strength is responsible for the departure from the linear response result  @xcite .",
    "since the kondo resonance is better accounted for in nvca , the curves leave the linear response data sooner than the respective ncpt results .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the largest current is obtained exactly at the crossover points from the kondo to the empty or doubly occupied quantum dot ( these regions are marked by black - dashed lines in middle and right panel of fig.[fig : gatedcurrent ] ) .",
    "this aspect can be seen more clearly in fig.[fig : gatedcurrentofvg ] , where the current is plotted as a function of gate voltage .",
    "for @xmath68 there is not much difference between the ncpt and nvca results as can be inferred from fig.[fig : gatedcurrent ] . for @xmath69 , however , we see that the feedback mechanism in vca has a significant impact and leads to smoother @xmath108 curves due to suppression of finite size effects originating from the reference system .",
    "the sharp jumps at the crossover point in fig.[fig : gatedcurrentofvg ] originate from abrupt changes of the particle number in the ground state of the central cluster @xmath72 .",
    "we expect that this step smoothens with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "+ concerning the reliability of the methods used , our data suggest that outside the parameter region where kondo correlations dominate the single occupied quantum dot ( in between the horizontal dashed black lines in fig.[fig : gatedcurrent ] ) ncpt and nvca perform almost equally well .",
    "results are significantly easier to obtain outside the kondo plateau ( which was mentioned before e.g. in ref .   within exact diagonalization / cpt / vca or in ref .",
    "within dmrg ) . thereby the convergence within system size is greatly enhanced with respect to the kondo region and very accurate results may be obtained already with small systems .",
    "therefore , we may argue that for the steady - state of the siam , ncpt and nvca perform quite well outside the kondo region for any interaction strength as well as in the kondo region for small interaction strengths . on the other hand , in the kondo region",
    "nvca outperforms ncpt for higher interaction strengths .",
    "we have presented results for the steady - state of the single - impurity anderson model . we have applied non - equilibrium cluster perturbation theory and its variational extension , the non - equilibrium variational cluster approach to this model for a single quantum dot under bias .",
    "both methods make use of the keldysh green s function formalism and are capable of working in the thermodynamic limit which is necessary to account for particle and energy dissipation mechanisms .",
    "+ results for the particle - hole symmetric model , which is dominated by kondo correlations , have been compared to time evolving block decimation and quantum monte carlo . at low values of interaction strength",
    "they show excellent agreement already for non - equilibrium cluster perturbation theory . for higher values of interaction strength ,",
    "the self - consistency implemented within the non - equilibrium variational cluster approach proves crucial in order to obtain reasonable results .",
    "both methods coincide with the low bias linear response data for the steady - state current .",
    "both methods furthermore become exact in the non - interacting limit .",
    "+ the non - equilibrium local density of states of the quantum dot exhibits a linear and interaction dependent splitting of the bias voltage within the non - equilibrium variational cluster approach which is not visible in the non - equilibrium cluster perturbation theory . at a certain ( interaction dependent ) bias voltage",
    "we find that this split kondo resonance merges with the high energy incoherent part of the spectrum .",
    "+ when applying a gate voltage and thereby leaving the kondo regime , calculations become a lot easier and non - equilibrium cluster perturbation theory and the non - equilibrium variational cluster approach appear to perform very well , which can be inferred from the convergence of our data .",
    "the highest current amplitude is obtained at the crossover from the kondo to the empty or doubly - occupied quantum dot .",
    "experimental stability diagrams are reproduced very well within the variational approach .",
    "they show a clear kondo regime and a coulomb blockade region .",
    "+ we may conclude that the non - equilibrium variational cluster approach is a promising method for the evaluation of steady - state quantities of strongly correlated model systems .",
    "dynamic quantities become available in the whole complex plane and , in principle any fermionic or bosonic lattice model may be treated including multi - band or multi - orbital systems .",
    "it is both fast and versatile and in principle all parameter regimes of the model are accessible .",
    "subjects for further investigation are the self - consistency criterion , which is not unique , as well as the use of different variational parameters and an optimized out of equilibrium variational principle .",
    "+    we gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with s. andergassen and thank p. werner for providing his continuous time qmc data .",
    "this work was partly supported by the austrian science fund ( fwf ) p24081-n16 and vicom sub projects f04103 and f04104 .",
    "some of the numerical calculations have been conducted at the vienna scientific cluster ( vsc - i@xmath109ii ) .",
    "upon introducing the basic notation we follow standard literature ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the non - equilibrium single - particle properties are provided by the single - particle green s function in the @xmath110 keldysh space ( denoted by tildes ) @xmath111 where @xmath112 are again matrices in site / spin space and functions of two time coordinates  @xcite .",

    "the non - equilibrium density of states at site @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 which has to fulfill the spectral sum rule @xmath129",
    "in this paper we compare ncpt with nvca for different auxiliary one particle terms @xmath50 . in agreement with our previous experience , that the variational hopping parameters are crucial for the physics in the kondo regime  @xcite , we observe that it suffices to consider only hopping processes inside the central region of the reference system .",

    "the second term contains nearest neighbor hopping processes between the lead sites of the central region except the border one .",

    ", we consider the following cases : ( @xmath132 ) with @xmath133 , ( @xmath134 ) with @xmath135 , ( @xmath136 ) with @xmath137 , and ( @xmath138 ) with @xmath139 . + a bias voltage @xmath104 is applied in an anti - symmetric manner by setting the on - site energies as well as the chemical potentials of the left and right leads to @xmath13 .",
    "note that the sites of the leads which are incorporated in the central region of the reference system are also subjected to these on - site energies .",
    "all calculations are done for sizes of the central region of @xmath140-sites , which corresponds to symmetric central regions .",
    "we note that @xmath141 suffer from a finite - size gap which closes with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "this gap arises due to an even amount of sites to the left as well as to the right of the quantum dot .",
    "we do not consider even @xmath36 since this would correspond to an unequal amount of sites of the left and right lead in the central region .",
    "thereby , the geometric symmetry of the problem would be spoiled and the application of a bias voltage which respects particle - hole symmetry would not be possible .",
    "+ in order to reduce finite size effects of the calculated quantities and to make an extrapolation to infinite central cluster sizes easier we scrutinized the idea of averaging over boundary conditions as outlined in ref .   or ref .",
    "in cpt / vca one has the freedom to add single - particle terms to @xmath26 and subtract them again in @xmath33 .",
    "therefore we may add hopping terms which connect the first and last site of the central cluster and which have an arbitrary phase .",
    "the spectral function of the impurity site for a central region with complex periodic boundary conditions is in general no longer particle hole symmetric , which makes it necessary to average @xmath142 over @xmath143 to retain the symmetry .",
    "+ the result , however , was disappointing as the expected faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit has not been confirmed .",
    "+ in this work we do not consider the long - range part of the coulomb interaction which leads to additional charging effects in real devices ."
