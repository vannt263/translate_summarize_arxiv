    "electric forces on insulating bodies are notoriously difficult to calculate @xcite . only in very special instances can the calculation be performed by elementary means .",
    "the simplest case , treated in every undergraduate textbook on electricity and magnetism , is that of a dielectric slab attracted by a parallel - plate capacitor .",
    "nearly as simple is the determination of the force of attraction on a liquid dielectric by a vertical cylindrical capacitor .",
    "it is remarkable that , under appropriate conditions , in both cases conservation of energy alone leads to a simple expression for the force with no need to know the complicated fringing field responsible for the attraction .",
    "conservation of energy leads to the same expression for the force independently of whether the voltage or the charge of the capacitor is assumed to remain constant during a hypothetical infinitesimal displacement of the dielectric .",
    "it is reassuring that a detailed treatment based on a direct consideration of the fringing field leads to the same result @xcite .",
    "since the dynamics of the dielectric under such a force is not discussed in the textbooks , one may be left with the false impression that the motion is unaffected by the choice of constant voltage or constant charge .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of a liquid dielectric pulled into a vertical cylindrical capacitor by electrostatic forces .",
    "the motion is quantitatively different , though qualitatively the same , depending on whether the voltage or the charge of the capacitor is held constant .",
    "it will be seen that this is a very peculiar variable - mass system , since in certain circumstances the velocity can change abruptly during a very short time interval right after the beginning of the motion .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the elementary calculation of the force exerted by a vertical cylindrical capacitor on a liquid dielectric . in section 3",
    "the dynamics is investigated assuming the voltage applied to the capacitor stays constant .",
    "the motion of the liquid near the bottom edge is described qualitatively only , since our expression for the electrostatic force is not valid near the ends of the capacitor . for the motion",
    "when the surface of the dielectric is well inside the capacitor quantitative results are obtained . in section 3 we briefly discuss the case in which the charge of the capacitor is held fixed , and a qualitative description of the motion is given .",
    "section 4 is devoted to final comments and conclusions .",
    "let us consider a coaxial cylindrical capacitor of length @xmath0 whose inner and outer radii are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , with @xmath3 .",
    "suppose the capacitor is in the vertical position and is partially immersed in a liquid dielectric contained in a tank , in such a way that the surface of the liquid that has entered the capacitor is far from its ends .",
    "if a potential difference is applied between the capacitor plates , the dielectric will be pulled into the capacitor .",
    "the calculation of the force of attraction is a textbook problem @xcite which we proceed to work out for subsequent use .",
    "let @xmath4 be the length of the capacitor that is immersed in the liquid before the voltage is turned on .",
    "after the voltage is turned on the liquid inside the capacitor rises to the height @xmath5 , as depicted in fig 1 .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the linear charge densities on the parts of the inner plate that are in empty space and in contact with the dielectric , respectively .",
    "the corresponding electric fields in vacuum and inside the dielectric are    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the radial unit vector and @xmath10 is the permittivity of the dielectric .",
    "the voltage @xmath11 applied to the capacitor is given by the radial line integral either of @xmath12 or @xmath13 :    @xmath14    from this the capacitance can be readily found . indeed ,",
    "the total charge of the capacitor is    @xmath15 +   \\lambda_2   ( l_0 + x ) = \\frac{2\\pi v}{\\ln ( b / a)}\\bigl\\{\\epsilon_0   [ l - ( l_0 + x ) ] + \\epsilon ( l_0 + x ) \\bigr \\ } \\ , , \\ ] ]    whence    @xmath16 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the electric susceptibility of the dielectric .",
    "the force on the dielectric can be determined by equating the work done by the capacitor during a displacement @xmath18 of the dielectric to the decrease of the electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor .",
    "thus , assuming the charge @xmath19 of the capacitor remains constant as the displacement takes place ,    @xmath20    where eq .",
    "( [ capacitance ] ) has been used . since",
    "this force is positive , the dielectric is pulled into the capacitor .",
    "as is well known , the same result is obtained for the force if , instead of the charge @xmath19 , the voltage @xmath11 of the capacitor is assumed to remain constant during the displacement .",
    "but in the latter case the battery responsible for maintaining the voltage fixed does work as the dielectric is displaced , and this work must be taken into account in the energy balance @xcite . since the _ expression _ for the force is the same in both cases , it may seem obvious that the _ motion _ of the liquid dielectric does not depend on whether the charge or the voltage is held constant .",
    "this is not the case , however , for a reason that may be easily overlooked .",
    "if the voltage is held constant then the force ( [ force ] ) is constant during the entire motion .",
    "however , if the charge @xmath19 remains constant then , using @xmath21 and eq .",
    "( [ capacitance ] ) , the force ( [ force ] ) becomes    @xmath22 ^ 2 } \\ , .\\ ] ]    this is a _ variable _ force that depends on the position of the dielectric because the capacitance increases and the voltage decreases as the dielectric penetrates the capacitor .",
    "therefore , the _ dynamics _ of the dielectric is different depending on whether the charge or the voltage of the capacitor is constant throughout the motion .",
    "the equation of motion of the liquid dielectric is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the mass of the dielectric that is already inside the capacitor at time @xmath25 .",
    "the presence of the term proportional to @xmath26 on the right - hand side of ( [ equationmotion ] ) is justified as follows .",
    "the pressure at the bottom of the liquid column that is inside the capacitor is higher than the pressure at the top by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the density of the dielectric .",
    "this gives rise to a net upward pressure force that equals @xmath29 and must be added to the electrostatic force @xmath30 .",
    "we have assumed that the area of the tank is much larger than @xmath31 , so that the variation of the height of the liquid in the tank can be safely ignored .",
    "other hypotheses will be mentioned in due time .",
    "the mass of liquid inside the capacitor is    @xmath32    insertion of this expression for the mass into the equation of motion ( [ equationmotion ] ) leads to    @xmath33 = \\frac{f } { \\pi ( b^2 -a^2 ) \\rho } - g x \\ , .\\ ] ]",
    "if @xmath11 is constant , the use of ( [ force ] ) allows us to write eq.([equationmotionsimplyfied ] ) as    @xmath34    where we have introduced the new variable @xmath35 defined by    @xmath36    the task of solving equation ( [ equationmotion - constantv - new variable - y ] ) is made easier by writing it in dimensionless form .",
    "it is easy to check that the positive constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 defined by    @xmath39    have dimensions of length and time , respectively . in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and dimensionless parameter @xmath42 , defined by    @xmath43    the differential equation ( [ equationmotion - constantv - new variable - y ] ) reduces to    @xmath44    this equation has the equilibrium solution @xmath45 , which is tantamount to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 is the height at which the weight of the dielectric that has risen above the external level is exactly counterbalanced by the electric force that pulls it up .    equation ( [ dimensionless - equationmotion - constantv ] ) can be solved by standard techniques .",
    "first of all we make a change of independent variable :    @xmath47    this reduces eq.([dimensionless - equationmotion - constantv ] ) to    @xmath48    or , in terms of differential forms ,    @xmath49    we seek an integrating factor @xmath50 that turns the left - hand side of this equation into an exact differential :    @xmath51    such a function @xmath52 exists if and only if    @xmath53=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p } [ n(\\xi ) ( p^2 + \\xi -1 - \\alpha ) ]    \\longrightarrow \\xi \\frac{dn}{d\\xi}=n \\ , .\\ ] ]    thus , @xmath54 is an integrating factor and we have    @xmath55    the function @xmath56 can be readily found by integrating @xmath57 along the broken path composed of the two straight line segments @xmath58 , and one immediately gets    @xmath59    therefore , the general solution of ( [ equationmotion - constantv - for - p ] ) is    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is an integration constant .      equation ( [ force ] ) is adequate for the force only when the surface of the liquid is far from the edges of the capacitor .",
    "therefore , it is not legitimate to put @xmath62 in equation ( [ equationmotion - constantv - new variable - y ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , something remarkable happens when one considers @xmath62 .",
    "since the attraction is caused by the fringing field , it is clear that the force on the liquid dielectric is not zero when its surface just touches the lower edge of the capacitor .",
    "suppose that at @xmath63 the liquid is at rest , the voltage is turned on and the upward motion begins with @xmath64 . then the  first \" ascending layer of the liquid has zero mass but is pulled into the capacitor with a finite force .",
    "thus , ideally , it is subjected to an infinite acceleration , which brings about a finite jump of the velocity .",
    "sure enough there is a transient process during which the electric field builds up and the velocity changes continuosly .",
    "however , since the time scale of this transient process is certainly much shorter than the time scale of the motion , it seems reasonable to expect that it can be satisfactorily modelled by a discontinuous jump of the velocity .",
    "furthermore , the value attained by the velocity right after the transient , when so to speak the electrostatic force takes over , most likely can not be freely chosen .",
    "this is a very peculiar behavior of this unconventional variable - mass system , whose mass can drop to zero at certain instants in the course of its motion .",
    "it turns out that this unique behavior is nicely illustrated , at least in some of its main qualitative aspects , by our description . in order to check this statement",
    "let us try to find out what the equation of motion has to tell us about the dynamics of the liquid near the edge of the capacitor , although the quantitative results are admittedly unreliable .",
    "with @xmath65 because we are taking @xmath62 , the initial condition @xmath66 demands @xmath67 , as plainly seen from either ( [ dimensionless - equationmotion - constantv ] ) or ( [ equationmotion - constantv - for - p ] ) . accordingly , since @xmath40 starts to increase immediately after @xmath63 , we take for initial conditions @xmath66 and @xmath68 , a choice that leads to @xmath69 in equation ( [ solution - for - p ] ) . as a consequence , eq.([solution - for - p ] ) can be solved for @xmath70 in the form    @xmath71    this is easily inverted to yield    @xmath72    it is clear that @xmath40 attains its maximum value @xmath73 at @xmath74 , and returns to its initial value @xmath64 at @xmath75 . then @xmath70 changes abruptly from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and the motion repeats itself , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the period of oscillation is @xmath78 in dimensionless units .",
    "these quantitative results are not trustworthy and the cusps at the turning points will be smoothed out in the actual motion , but the qualitative nature of the dynamics seems to be well represented by our description .",
    "let us suppose now that @xmath79 , where @xmath0 is the length of the capacitor , so that the liquid starts its motion well inside the capacitor . in this case",
    "our appoach is expected to be fairly realistic , and furnish quantitative results that can be taken seriously .",
    "if the fluid is at rest when the voltage is turned on , the initial conditions are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are equivalent to @xmath82 and @xmath83 according to equation ( [ dimensionless - variables ] ) . in this case",
    "the constant of integration is given by @xmath84 and equation ( [ solution - for - p ] ) becomes    @xmath85    recalling that @xmath86 , this equation can be solved in the form    @xmath87    the appearence of the square root of a cubic polynomial in the above integrand indicates that the solution for @xmath88 will be given by elliptic functions .",
    "however , much interesting information about the motion can be obtained without using these not so familiar functions . to this end note",
    "that equation ( [ equation - for - p - far - from - edge ] ) is formally equivalent to the one that describes the motion of a particle with zero  total energy \" in the  potential \" @xmath89 .",
    "the positivity of the  kinetic energy \" @xmath90 constrains @xmath40 to the region @xmath91 . since @xmath92 , in terms of @xmath40 the physically allowed region is @xmath93 , as follows from eq.([dimensionless - variables ] ) .    the function @xmath89 has the following properties : ( i ) @xmath94 ; ( ii ) @xmath95 which implies @xmath96 for @xmath40 slightly bigger than @xmath42 ; ( iii ) @xmath97 as @xmath98 ; ( iv ) there is only one positive solution to @xmath99 , which is readily found to be @xmath100 and corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "this result for @xmath101 is merely a confirmation of what was found directly from the equation of motion ( [ dimensionless - equationmotion - constantv ] ) .",
    "now we have enough information to draw a qualitative graph of the  potential \" , which is depicted in fig .",
    "the motion is confined to the  potential well \" shown in the same figure .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation of the surface of the liquid , that is , the maximum value attained by @xmath40 is the only positive value @xmath102 such that @xmath89 equals zero . in the region @xmath103",
    "the  potential \" is positive and the motion is forbidden .",
    "the amplitude @xmath104 is the positive solution to the algebraic equation    @xmath105    since @xmath106 .",

    "a binomial expansion gives the following approximate expression for @xmath104 :    @xmath110 = \\alpha + 2 \\ , .\\ ] ]    as a consequence , @xmath111 .",
    "therefore the surface of the liquid dielectric inside the capacitor oscillates periodically between @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "from ( [ solution - for - csi - far - from - edge ] ) it follows at once that the period of oscillation is    @xmath114    an expression for @xmath115 in terms of elliptic integrals is given in the appendix .",
    "unfortunately , under normal laboratory conditions the oscillation of the surface of the liquid will be very hard to observe . in order to make @xmath37 and @xmath38 as large as possible , one needs a low - density liquid with very high susceptibility .",
    "not only @xmath1 and @xmath2 but also their difference should be as small as possible , while the voltage should be as high as possible",
    ". however , these choices are limited , among other things , by the dielectric strength of the liquid .",
    "the dielectric strength of typical insulators @xcite is about @xmath116 v / m .",
    "the maximum electric field inside the capacitor is easily seen to be @xmath117 , so that one must have @xmath118 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 in meters .",
    "furthermore , the difference @xmath119 can not be too small lest capillarity becomes dominant .",
    "to give an idea of the order of magnitudes involved , consider pure water , for which @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "take @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 volts , a very high voltage . then from ( [ scales - lenght - time - v ] ) and ( [ dimensionless - variables ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath127 cm , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 .",
    "it follows that the amplitude of the oscillation is @xmath131 .",
    "the period of oscillation calculated in the appendix is @xmath132 .",
    "it should be stressed that these values for the amplitude and the period require an extremely high voltage .",

    "a qualitative description of the motion can be given following the pattern set by the previous case .",
    "the shape of the  potential \" is exactly the same as the one shown in fig .",
    "the motion is periodic and confined to the interval @xmath143 where , now , @xmath144 is determined by a transcendental equation because of the logarithmic term in ( [ first - integral - q ] ) , which prevents us from giving an explicit expression for the amplitude of the oscillation . the period is also given by a complicated integral involving the square root of a logarithm .",
    "the motion of a liquid dielectric attracted by a vertical cylindrical capacitor is an unusual example of dynamics of a variable - mass system .",
    "as we have seen , because the initial mass vanishes for motion of the liquid near the lower edge of the capacitor with the most natural initial conditions , the velocity change can be qualitatively modelled by a jump determined by the equation of motion itself .",
    "assuming that the surface of the liquid remains far from the ends of the capacitor , we exactly solved for the motion in the case of constant voltage and found not too complicated expressions for the amplitude and the period of the oscillation .",
    "if , instead , the charge of the capacitor is held constant , the motion is qualitatively the same but quantitative results are different , and demand more complicated numerical computations .",
