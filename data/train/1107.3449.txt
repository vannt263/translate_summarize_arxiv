    "the question of the finite summability of these triples is carefully considered with results by connes @xcite and voiculescu @xcite : using the regular representation of @xmath31 , an obstruction to finite - summability appears and allows only @xmath32-summability .",
    "however , faithful representations of @xmath31 , not quasi - equivalent to the left regular one and based on the existence of periodic points for dynamical systems , can give rise to arbitrary finite - summable spectral triples .",

    "the compactification takes place in the space of the variables @xmath58 .    in order to get a compact version of this @xmath0-deformed minkowski space",

    "since @xmath60 is discrete and non - abelian , the associated algebra @xmath61 is unital and noncommutative , so it can be interpreted as a compact noncommutative space .",

    "let us mention that the groups we will encounter will be decomposed as crossed products with @xmath62 , so both the ( related ) theories of discrete dynamical systems and crossed products of @xmath1-algebras will be intensively used in many parts of this work .",
    "the goal is to study the existence of spectral triples for the @xmath0-deformed space . a spectral triple ( or unbounded fredholm module ) @xmath63 @xcite",

    "( @xmath69 is always a @xmath70-subalgebra of @xmath64 . )",
    "+ of course , the natural choice of the algebra @xmath64 is to take the @xmath1-algebra of the group @xmath23 , but since @xmath71 has no unit , we need to replace the second axiom by :    - @xmath72 has a compact resolvent for any @xmath73 . +",
    "this technical new axiom generates a lot of analytical complexities but is necessary to capture the metric dimension associated to @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , if a riemannian spin manifold @xmath74 is non - compact , the usual dirac operator @xmath24 has a continuous spectrum on @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the spinor bundle on @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral triple @xmath77 has a metric dimension which is equal to the dimension of @xmath74 .",
    "a noncommutative example ( the moyal plane ) of that kind has been studied in @xcite .",
    "+ we try to avoid these difficulties here by using a unital algebra @xmath64 .",
    "we consider only dimension @xmath12 but the results can be extended to higher dimensions thanks to . to get a unit , we choose a discrete subgroup @xmath60 of @xmath23 such that @xmath78 .",

    "this subgroup is a non - discrete `` @xmath87 '' group .",

    "this procedure drives us to the analysis of the algebraic nature of @xmath27 .",

    "this semi - direct structure gives rise to a dynamical system which is heavily used in the following .",
