    "the reconstruction of a non - negative distribution from its moments constitutes the so - called classical moment problem , and is an archetypal example of an inverse problem  @xcite in mathematical sciences . owing to its importance in the context of probability theory and the challenging problems of analysis associated with it ,",
    "the moment problem has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers from many diverse fields of science and engineering  @xcite . in the classical hausdorff moment problem ( hmp ) , one addresses the problem of reconstructing a non - negative , real valued function @xmath0 in a finite interval @xmath1 $ ] from a sequence of real numbers",
    ". the sequence forms a ` moment sequence ' that satisfies the hausdorff conditions  @xcite .",
    "the problem is severely ill - posed in the hadamard sense  @xcite . for a finite number of moments ,",
    "most of the existing numerical methods are susceptible to large instabilities but several methods do exist that attempt to construct a regularized solution by avoiding these instabilities  @xcite . the hmp has been addressed by using a variety of methods ( such as tikhonov s regularization method  @xcite and the use of pollaczek polynomial by viano  @xcite ) but the information - theoretic approach is particularly fascinating to the physicists . the latter is based on the _ maximum entropy principle _ ( mep ) proposed by jaynes  @xcite . the mep provides a suitable framework to reconstruct a distribution by maximizing the shannon information entropy  @xcite and at the same time ensures the matching of the moments of the distribution .",
    "our interest in the moment problem stems from the fact that inverse problems of this type are frequently encountered in many areas of physical , mathematical and biological sciences  @xcite .",
    "a very simple but elegant example is the inversion of the specific heat data of solids .",
    "it is known that the constant volume vibrational specific heat of a solid can be expressed as the convolution of a known function of the frequency and the vibrational frequency distribution function ( fdf )  @xcite .",
    "the task of extracting the fdf by inverting the experimentally - measured values of the specific heat at constant volume as a function of temperature is a well - known example of an inverse problem in solid state physics  @xcite .",
    "the focus of our present work is to reconstruct a non - negative function very accurately within the framework of the mep from the knowledge of a finite number of moments .",
    "although there exists a number of numerical procedures that address this problem , most of them become unreliable when the number of moment constraints exceeds a problem - dependent upper limit . a close review of the methods and the study of the example functions presented therein immediately reveal the weakness of the methods  @xcite . for example",
    ", it is very difficult to reproduce accurately the van hove singularities in the frequency distribution of ( crystalline ) solids or the presence of a gap in the density of electronic states in a solid . while the algorithm proposed by silver and rder  @xcite does reproduce the latter correctly and is capable of dealing with a large number of moments , we are not aware of any systematic study of function reconstruction by this approach at this time .",
    "it is , therefore , worthwhile to explore the possibility of developing a reliable scheme for the entropy optimization program and to apply it to a range of non - negative functions having complex structure within the interval .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe a procedure that has been developed recently by us to reduce the moment problem to a discretized entropy optimization problem ( eop )  @xcite .",
    "we then test our methodology in section iii by examining to what extent it is successful in reconstructing a wide variety of functions on the basis of input information in the form of chebyshev moments of the functions .",
    "the convergence behavior of the maximum entropy solution is then discussed in section iv with particular emphasis on the number of moments .",
    "the proximity of the reconstructed solution to the exact solution for different distributions is also studied via kullback - leibler  @xcite divergence and variation measures  @xcite .",
    "the classical moment problem for a finite interval [ a , b ] , also known as the hausdorff moment problem  @xcite , can be stated as follows .",

    "the problem is to construct the non - negative function @xmath2 from the knowledge of its moments .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist were given by hausdorff  @xcite .",
    "the moment problem and its variants have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "mead and papanicolaou  @xcite have , in particular discussed a number of moment problems encountered in various of physics . for a finite number of moments ,",
    "the problem is underdetermined and it is not possible to construct the unique solution from the moment sequence unless further assumptions about the function are made . within the framework of maximum entropy principle ,",
    "one attempts to find a function @xmath2 that maximizes the information entropy functional ,    s [ ] = - _ a^b ( x ) dx [ eq-2 ]    subject to the moment constraints defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting solution is an approximate function @xmath5 , which can be obtained by functional differentiation of a lagrangian with respect to the unknown function @xmath2 .",

    "me(x ) = ( -_i=1^m _ i x^i)/z , where @xmath10 is known as the partition function .",
    "a reliable scheme for handling the entropy optimization problem subject to the matching of the moments was discussed by us in ref.@xcite .",
    "the essential idea behind the approach is to use a discretized form of the shannon entropy functional and the moment constraints using an accurate quadrature formula .",
    "the constraint optimization problem involving the primal variables is then reduced to an unconstrained convex optimization program involving the dual variables of the problem .",

    ", the discretized lagrangian can be written as ,    l ( , * * ) = _ j=1^n _ j ( ) - _ i=1^m _ i ( _ j=1^n t_ij _ j - _ i ) , [ eq-7 ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively are the primal and the dual variables of the eop . in the equation",
    "above , we have used the notation @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the discretized me solution is given by the functional variation with respect to the unknown function as before , ^me_j = ( _ i=1^m t_ij _ i - 1 ) , j=1 , 2 ,  n. [ eq-8 ]    equations ( [ eq-1 ] ) and ( [ eq-8 ] ) can be combined together and the eop can be reduced to an unconstrained convex optimization problem involving the dual variables @xmath17 s : _ r^m .    by iteratively obtaining an estimate of @xmath17 , @xmath18 can be minimized , and the me solution @xmath19 can be constructed from eq .",
    "( [ eq-8 ] ) .",
    "the objective function @xmath20 can be minimized by modifying a method , which is largely due to bergman  @xcite , and was presented and discussed at length in ref.@xcite both for the power and the chebyshev moments . for the latter ,",
    "the me solution can be shown to be expressed in the form of eq.([eq-8 ] ) with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the shifted chebyshev polynomials . in the following ,",
    "we apply our algorithm to reconstruct a variety of functions corresponding to different number of shifted chebyshev moments .",
    "we now illustrate the method by reconstructing a number of exact functions from a knowledge of their moments . for all but one of the examples studied here",
    ", the moments of the functions can be obtained from analytical expressions . in the remaining case",
    "the moments have been calculated numerically using standard double precision arithmetic .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we map the functions onto the interval [ 0,1 ] and assume they are normalized so that the functions can be treated as probability density functions ( pdf ) without any loss of generality .",
    "it is well - known that for a finite number of moments , the hausdorff moment problem can not be solved uniquely .",
    "one needs to supply additional information to choose a suitable solution from an ensemble of solutions that satisfy the given moment constraints .",
    "the maximum entropy ( me ) ansatz constructs the _ least biased _ solution that maximizes the entropy associated with the density and is consistent with the given moments .",
    "the accuracy of the reconstructed solution can be measured by varying the number of moments .",
    "a comparison with the exact solution ( if available ) would reveal to what extent the me solution matches with the exact solution . for an unknown function with a finite set of moments , the quality of the me solution may be judged by the proximity of the input ( exact ) moments to the output ( approximated ) moments resulting from the reconstructed distribution . by increasing the number of moments one can systematically improve the quality of the solution .",
    "it should , however , be noted , that for a function with a complicated structure , the convergence of the first few moments does not guarantee its accurate reproduction .",
    "the me solution in this case may not represent the exact solution , but is still correct as far as the maximum entropy principle is concerned .",
    "it is therefore important to study the convergence behavior of the solutions with moments for a number of functions with widely different shapes . to this end",
    "we compare , in the following , our maximum entropy solution corresponding to a variety of exact distribution and a distribution amenable to an accurate numerical analysis .",
    "we begin with a step function which is unity throughout the interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we use the shifted chebyshev polynomials @xmath24 , which is defined via ,    t_n^*(x ) & = & t_n(2x - 1 ) + t_n(x ) & = & n = 0 , 1 ,     the moments can be calculated analytically in this case , and are given by , @xmath25    although the function does not have any structure , it is particularly important because of its behavior at the end points .",
    "owing to the presence of discontinuities at @xmath26 and 1 , the function is difficult to reproduce close to these points .",
    "the sharp discontinuities cause the reconstructed function ( from a small number of moments ) to exhibit spurious oscillations near the end points .",
    "the oscillations are progressively suppressed by increasing the number of chebyshev moments in our iterative method . beyond 100 moments",
    "the oscillations completely disappear .",
    "this behavior is seen clearly in fig.[fig1 ] where we have plotted the reconstructed functions corresponding to 40 , 60 and 80 moments . the oscillations are particularly pronounced as one approaches @xmath27 , but die down with increase in the number of moments .",
    "the result corresponding to 100 moments is presented in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the plot clearly reveals that the function has been reproduced with an error , which is less than 1 part in @xmath28 .",
    "the next example we consider is a square - root function @xmath30 , where the prefactor is chosen to normalize the function . in many physical problems ,",
    "we often encounter distributions showing a square - root behavior . for example",
    ", the spectral distribution of a free electron gas in 3-dimension is related to the energy via @xmath31 , and the square - root behavior persists in the weak interaction limit ( at low energy ) .",
    "it is therefore important to see if such a square - root function can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy using our maximum entropy ansatz .",
    "the shifted chebyshev moments for the present case are given by ,    @xmath32    the results for the function are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] to [ fig5 ] for 100 moments .",
    "the reconstructed function is found to match excellently with the exact function throughout the interval as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "of particular importance is the behavior of the function near @xmath26 and 1 .",
    "the square - root behavior is accurately reproduced without any deviation or oscillation near @xmath33 = 0 as is evident from fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "similarly , the behavior near @xmath33 = 1 is also reproduced with a high degree of accuracy as shown in fig.[fig5 ] . since our method can exploit the information embedded in the higher moments , it is capable of reproducing the function very accurately without any oscillation .",
    "having discussed two relatively simple examples , we now consider a case where the function vanishes in a finite domain within the interval .",
    "such a function appears frequently in the context of the energy density of states of amorphous and crystalline semiconductors .",
    "it is instructive to study whether our maximum entropy ( me ) method is capable of reproducing a gap in the energy eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "since the moments of the electronic density of states can be obtained from the hamiltonian of the system , our method can be used as an alternative tool to construct the density of states from the moments .",
    "this is particularly useful for treating a large non - crystalline system ( e.g. in the amorphous or liquid state ) , in which case the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix is computationally overkill and scales with the cubic power of the system size .",
    "in contrast , our maximum entropy ansatz provides an efficient and accurate procedure for the determination of total ( band ) energy and the fermi level subject to the availability of the energy moments .",
    "here we use a toy model of a density of states that consists of two parabolae separated by a gap to illustrate the usefulness of our method .",
    "in particular , we choose a normalized distribution with a gap from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , @xmath36    where a and b are given by @xmath37 in the present case , we choose @xmath38 and @xmath39 giving the value of the gap @xmath40 .",
    "the chebyshev moments of the function can be calculated exactly , and as in the previous examples the function is reconstructed from the moments . in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we have plotted the results obtained from our me ansatz along with the exact functional values at the quadrature points .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the reconstructed function matches excellently with the exact one .",
    "furthermore , the method reproduces the gap between the parabolae correctly without any oscillation in the gap .",
    "table 1 lists the size of the gap corresponding to different number of moments for two sets of gaussian points . since we are using a finite number of quadrature points , the accuracy of our gap size is limited by the resolution of the ( non - uniform ) quadrature grid near the gap .",
    "we have chosen a tolerance @xmath41 for the reconstructed functional value to locate the onset of the gap ( i.e. the zero of the function )  @xcite .",
    "it is evident from table 1 that as the number of moments increases , the size of the gap improves and eventually converges very close to the exact numerical value .",
    "the accuracy can be improved further by using more gaussian points in the quadrature .",
    ".[tab2 ] numerical values of the gap for different number of moments from the reconstructed double - parabolic distribution . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now consider a function that has singularities in the range [ 0,1 ] . for the purpose of our discussion",
    "we refer to this function as ` u - function ' hereafter .",
    "the shifted chebyshev moments of the function have the interesting property that except for the zeroth moment , all the other moments are identically zero .",
    "the task of the me algorithm in this case is to construct a function having all the moments zero except for the zeroth moment , which is unity by normalization .",
    "it may be noted that the electronic density of states per atom @xmath43 of an infinite chain with a nearest neighbor interaction can be expressed in the form ,    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the on - site and the nearest neighbor hopping integrals respectively .",
    "the zeroth moment is unity , which implies that there is only one state associated with each atom . for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the density of states",
    "can be mapped onto the u - function within the interval [ 0:1 ] , and our algorithm can be applied to reconstruct the latter .",
    "an important characteristic of the density of states ( or distribution function ) is that it diverges at the band edges ( or at the end points ) .",
    "since all the chebyshev moments are zero aside from the zeroth moment , it is important to see if the algorithm is capable of generating the density with the correct diverging behavior at the ( band ) edges . in fig.[fig8 ] we have plotted the results for the function for three different sets of moments @xmath49 = 10 , 40 , and 80 to illustrate how the approximate solutions improve with the increase of the number of moments .",
    "the shape of the function begins to emerge correctly even for as few as first 10 moments but with significant oscillations and poor divergence behavior near the end points . as the number of moments increases",
    ", the solution rapidly converges and the oscillations begin to disappear . in fig.[fig9 ] we have plotted the results for @xmath50 .",
    "the reconstructed function matches excellently throughout the interval with the exact one .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 near the left edge at @xmath26 is shown in fig.[fig10 ] from @xmath33=0 to @xmath33=0.05 .",
    "it is evident from the plot that even for very small values of @xmath33 near the left edge , the reconstructed values agree with the exact values excellently .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed near the right edge of the band near @xmath33=1 .",
    "the capability of our method in reconstructing a function with singularities in the interval is thus convincingly demonstrated .",
    "the functions that we have discussed so far in the examples above are continuous within the interval",
    ". it would be interesting to consider a case where the function has a finite discontinuity within the interval .",
    "as an example , we choose a double - step function , @xmath51    which has a finite discontinuity at @xmath52 .",
    "it is rather challenging to reconstruct the function from the moments so that the local behavior near the discontinuity at @xmath53 is correctly reproduced .",
    "as before , the moment integrals can be calculated analytically in this case . in fig.[fig11 ] we have plotted the function for 10 , 20 and 50 moments .",
    "the solutions for the first two sets are expected to be less accurate , and indeed they show significant oscillations in the figure . for 50 moments",
    "the match is quite impressive . on adding further moments",
    ", the solution progressively improves .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the remarkable accuracy with which the function is reproduced by employing the first 100 moments .",
    "an important feature of the reconstructed function is that the discontinuity has been correctly reproduced with the exception of two points . from the various cases studied so far ,",
    "we conclude that about 80 to 120 moments are needed for point - wise matching of the exact and the reconstructed functions .      up until now",
    ", we have considered cases where the exact form of the function is known . in practical problems , however , it is more likely that the exact function is not available .",
    "we should therefore consider a case where the analytical expression for the distribution is not known , but a direct numerical solution is possible .",
    "as an example of such a distribution , we choose the natural invariant density of the logistic map @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the invariant density for the map can be obtained by calculating the moments from the time evolution of an ensemble of initial iterates @xmath56 as discussed in ref.@xcite . since the map is ergodic for this value of @xmath57 , the moments obtained via the time evolution of the map are identical to the moments of the natural invariant density  @xcite .",
    "the task of our maximum entropy algorithm is to reconstruct the approximate density , and to compare it with the numerical density .",
    "the latter can be obtained from a histogram of the iterates and averaging over a large number of configurations  @xcite . the result from our me ansatz using the first 80 moments is plotted in fig.[fig13 ] along with the numerical density .",
    "the plot clearly demonstrates that every aspect of the fine structure of the numerical density is reproduced excellently in the maximum entropy solution .",
    "finally , we end this section considering a rapidly oscillatory function having complex structure within the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "an example of such a function can be constructed as , f(x ) = ( ( 167 x ) + ( 73 x ) ) + 6(x - ) ^2 + [ oscill ] where the prefactors are chosen to normalize the function . in the context of studying diffusion in a rough one - dimensional potential ,",
    "zwanzig has studied such a function to obtain a general expression for the effective diffusion coefficient by analyzing the mean first - passage time  @xcite .",
    "the maximum entropy construction of this function is plotted in fig.[fig14 ] for 90 moments along with the exact function .",
    "once again the function is reproduced excellently with every little details of the local minima and maxima of the function .",
    "the convergence behavior of the maximum entropy solution has been discussed at length in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the analytical efforts are particularly focused on constructing bounds of the proximity of the reconstructed density to the exact density assuming that a given number of moments of the distributions are identical . in particular , given a target distribution @xmath0 and a reconstructed distribution @xmath58 that have identical first @xmath49 moments @xmath59 , the proximity of the two distributions can be expressed via the kullback - leibler divergence  @xcite and the variation measure  @xcite ,    [ mea ] @xmath60 & = \\int_{s } \\ , f(x ) \\ln \\left(\\frac{f(x)}{f_m(x)}\\right)\\ , dx \\label{first } \\\\",
    "d_{v}[f , f_m ] & = \\int_{s } \\ , \\vert f_m(x ) - f(x ) \\vert \\ , dx \\label{second } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the support of the densities @xmath0 and @xmath58 .",
    "the divergence measure is also known as the relative entropy or information discrimination , and @xmath62 with the equality holding if and only if @xmath63 for all @xmath33 .",
    "a lower bound for the divergence measure @xmath64 in terms of the variation measure was given by kullback  @xcite : d_kl + , [ kl - tag ] where it was assumed that the first @xmath49 moments are identical for both the distributions .",
    "since the exact distributions are known for the examples considered here ( except for the case 6 ) , we can use these measures to examine if the reconstructed solution indeed satisfies the inequality . to this end",
    ", we first study the convergence of the moments of the reconstructed distributions with iteration and establish that the moments can be matched very accurately so that for practical purposes the reconstructed moments can be taken as identical to the exact ( input ) moments for the calculation of measure in eqs.([first ] ) and ( [ second ] ) .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "we have observed that the quality of the me solutions depend on two factors : 1 ) the number of iterations and 2 ) the number of moments used for the purpose of reconstruction . in general , for a distribution with a fine structure , it is difficult to determine the minimal number of moments that are needed to reconstruct the function accurately .",
    "however , by studying a number of distributions with varying complexities and their convergence behavior , it is possible to obtain some useful information about the rate of convergence .",
    "we address this issue by choosing the u - function ( case 4 ) as an example , but the observation is found to be true for other cases as well . for a systematic study of convergence behavior of the reconstructed moments with iterations , one requires a measure of the goodness of the fit .",
    "we therefore introduce @xmath65 , the root mean square ( rms ) deviation of the exact moments from the moments provided by the me solution , _ 1(n ,",
    "m ) = . here",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively denote the exact ( or input ) and the reconstructed ( or output ) moments , and the latter depends on the number of moments ( @xmath49 ) and the iteration number ( @xmath68 ) . in the context of our present study , the exact moments of the functions are known , but in many practical cases they may not be available and need to be replaced by the input moments available for the problem . the quantity @xmath65 provides a measure of the proximity of the first @xmath49 reconstructed moments to the exact ones , and a small value of @xmath65 is indicative of the fact that the moment constraints are satisfied with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the value of @xmath65 becomes as small as @xmath69 provided an adequate number of iterations are performed to match a given set of moments . in fig.[fig15 ] , we have plotted @xmath65 for the case of u - function with the number of iteration progressively increasing to @xmath70 .",
    "the rms deviation decreases rapidly with the number of iteration and eventually drops to a value of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "an examination of the data suggests that @xmath65 can be fitted to an exponential decay with iteration and is plotted in fig.[fig15 ] .",
    "this behavior is also observed for the other distributions discussed in section 3 .",
    "it thus follows that the algorithm converges quite rapidly , and that the moment constraints can be satisfied to a high degree of accuracy even for a very large moment set .",
    "while @xmath65 provides a measure of the goodness of the fit for the moments , it does not necessarily guarantee a point - wise convergence of the reconstructed function with the exact one .",
    "this is particularly true if a small number of moments are used to reconstruct the function that has a fine structure in it ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig13 ] ) . in this case , the reconstructed moments can be matched to a high degree of accuracy with input moments , but the solution may still miss out the characteristic feature of the distribution folded in the higher order moments . the maximum entropy solution in this case may not reproduce the actual solution even though the approximate moments are very close to the exact moments . to ensure that @xmath65 indeed attains a sufficiently small value , we need to study the approximate solution vis - a - vis the number of moments for a fixed cycle of iterations .",
    "since the exact functions are known in our cases , the simplest way to measure the quality of the me solution is to construct the rms deviations of the reconstructed functions from the exact ones in the interval [ 0,1 ] : _",
    "2(n , m ) & = & + & & _",
    "2(m ) where @xmath71 is the number of points used in the quadrature . here",
    "we have assumed that the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath68 can be neglected so that @xmath73 , which holds for large @xmath68 owing to the fast decay of @xmath65 .",
    "we choose @xmath74 for each of the moment sets to study the variation of @xmath75 for different values of @xmath49 . in practice",
    ", the exact function may not be available but the expression for @xmath72 can still be used by replacing the exact function @xmath76 by @xmath77 and constructing the rms deviation for increasing values @xmath49 and @xmath78 . in fig.[fig16 ] , we have plotted @xmath72 for the case of u - function for different values of m. the plot shows a monotonic decrease of @xmath72 with the increasing values of m. for this function , we see that a value of @xmath49=100 to 120 provides a small enough @xmath72 to reconstruct the function accurately when @xmath74 .",
    "the solid line in the figure is an exponential fit to the data indicating a fast convergence of our algorithm with respect to the moments for a fixed value of @xmath65 .",
    "the proximity of the reconstructed distribution to the exact one can be quantified in terms of the divergence measure and the variation distance as defined in the beginning of this section .",
    "a number of inequalities can be found in the literature  @xcite that provide lower bounds of the relative entropy .",
    "the inequality in ( [ kl - tag ] ) is an example of such a bound although still sharper bounds are available in the literature  @xcite . in fig.[fig17 ] we have plotted the relative entropy of the u - function for different number of moments . the reconstructed solution for each of the moment sets m corresponds to @xmath74 so that the first m moments of the exact and the reconstructed functions are practically identical to each other .",
    "the right hand side of the inequality ( [ kl - tag ] ) is also plotted in the same figure for comparison . as the reconstructed solution approaches the exact solution with increasing number of moments ,",
    "the relative entropy or information discrimination between the two distributions decreases and eventually comes very close to the analytically predicted lower bound .",
    "in this paper we study the reconstruction of functions from a set of chebyshev moments ( of the functions ) via maximum entropy optimization .",
    "the method consists of mapping the original constraint optimization problem in primal space onto an unconstrained convex optimization problem in the dual space by using a discretized form of the moments and the shannon entropy of the function to be reconstructed . the resulting optimization problem is then solved iteratively by obtaining the optimal set of lagrange s parameters as prescribed in ref.@xcite . by virtue of its ability to deal with a larger number of moments ,",
    "our present approach is extremely robust and accurate .",
    "this makes it possible to reconstruct a variety of function that are difficult to handle otherwise .",
    "we demonstrate the accuracy of this method by applying to a number of functions for which the exact moments are available .",
    "the method accurately reproduces not only smooth and continuous functions ( such as square - root and double - parabolic functions ) but also non - smooth and discontinuous functions ( such as a double - step function with a finite discontinuity ) .",
    "it also captures the fine structure in a rapidly oscillatory function of known analytical form and the invariant densities of a logistic map corresponding to special values of the control parameter for which no analytical results are available .",
    "a convergence study of the reconstructed moments suggests that the rms deviation of the moments ( from the exact ones ) can be made as small as @xmath79 indicating the accuracy with which the input moments can be matched with the reconstructed ones .",
