    "recent observations of the corona with the lasco coronagraph @xcite on board of the soho spacecraft showed that the corona can be highly structured even during the solar activity minimum .",
    "the observations revealed a triple structure of the streamer belt which was existent for several consecutive days .",
    "the observations further showed that these triple structures occasionally go unstable leading to a seemingly new and extraordinarily huge kind of coronal mass ejection ( global cmes ) .",
    "natural questions arising from these observations are whether the helmet streamer triple structure is directly connected with or responsible for the occurrence of global cmes and what is the physical mechanism of their formation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a first step towards a better theoretical understanding of these phenomena .    the structure of helmet streamers and their stability has been studied both observationally and theoretically for a long time ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a natural association seems to exist between helmet streamer stability and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and sometimes cmes are accompanied by erupting prominences or filaments .",
    "coronal streamers are also thought to be the source regions of the slow solar wind and the activity processes discussed above may well contribute to this component of the solar wind .",
    "multiple streamer structures have already been observed before soho , however mainly during the maximum phase of the solar activity cycle .",
    "also , observations of the heliospheric plasma sheet seem to indicate a multiple current sheet substructure of the plasma sheet itself @xcite which has initiated several theoretical investigations of the stability of multiple current sheets @xcite .    the aim of this work is to present a simple method by which triple helmet streamer structures can be calculated self - consistently .",
    "we want to keep the method simple enough so that we can obtain largely analytical results without rendering our models too unrealistic .",
    "since the observed structures seem to be quite elongated ( the radial magnetic field component is considerably larger than the longitudinal magnetic field component ) , we can employ a method which has already been applied very successfully to the equilibrium structure of the magnetotail of the earth @xcite .",
    "the method is based on an asymptotic expansion .",
    "here we generalize this method and show how it can be applied to find solutions with internal multiple structures .",
    "obvious generalizations of the original magnetospheric versions to solar applications are the use of a more suitable coordinate system ( spherical rather than cartesian ) , the inclusion of magnetic shear , of the solar gravity field for large scale structures and of plasma flow on open field lines . for reasons of mathematical simplicity and",
    "since we only deal with the subcritical part of the flow , we confine the discussion to incompressible flow .",
    "our models provide a flexible quantitative description of structured helmet streamers .",
    "they can also be used as the starting configurations for future studies of the dynamical evolution of such structures .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] we present the mathematical basis of the method .",
    "section [ sec : results ] contains representative results obtained by applying the method under various sets of assumptions . in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarize the paper , give a discussion of our results and an outlook on future work .",
    "we use the equations of stationary ideal magnetohydrodynamics to describe the coronal plasma : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 stands for the plasma pressure , @xmath2 for the magnetic field , @xmath3 for the plasma density , @xmath4 for the solar gravitational potential , @xmath5 for the plasma velocity , @xmath6 for the electric field , @xmath7 is the gas constant , @xmath8 the temperature and @xmath9 the vacuum permeability . due to the high conductivity of the coronal plasma the magnetic field is frozen into it ( eq .",
    "[ ohm ] ) and we can make the assumption that the observed plasma features outline the magnetic field structure . throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we make the following assumptions :    * the streamer structure is very extended in azimuth and varies only very slowly along this direction ( this assumption is supported by the observations @xcite which showed that the triple structure existed for several days ) ; we can then describe the structure as approximately two - dimensional in the sense of rotational invariance . *",
    "the streamers are elongated in the radial direction and the radial magnetic field component is considerably stronger than the latitudinal component ; this is the basic assumption allowing to apply an asymptotic expansion procedure . *",
    "if flow is included , it is purely field - aligned and confined to the open field line region ; since we describe only the low lying parts of the streamer structure the flow velocities should be subcritical and we will therefore only consider incompressible flow . * for simplicity , we consider only isothermal equilibria ; in principle , other temperature structures or even the inclusion of an energy equation into the scheme is possible .    in the following ,",
    "we normalize the magnetic field by a typical value @xmath10 , the plasma pressure @xmath11 by @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the maximum value of @xmath11 ) , the mass density @xmath3 by @xmath14 , the length @xmath15 by a solar radius and the current density by @xmath16 .      to demonstrate the method we first use a two - dimensional cartesian geometry with no spatial variation in the @xmath17-direction ( @xmath18 ) and assume static structures ( @xmath19 ) without magnetic shear ( @xmath20 ) . in other geometries the basic properties of the method stay similar though the details may vary due to the geometry .",
    "writing the magnetic field as @xmath21 we find from equation ( [ stat ] ) that the flux function @xmath22 has to obey the equation ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) @xmath23 with the assumption of a constant temperature and because @xmath24 in cartesian geometry we get : @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "for slow variation of @xmath27 with height @xmath28 one can neglect gravity and finds @xmath29 .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic field perpendicular to the photosphere ( @xmath30 in the cartesian geometry ) is much larger than the parallel component ( @xmath31 in the cartesian geometry ) , or in other words , that streamers are rather elongated in the radial direction , we can use the method of asymptotic expansion and apply it to eq .",

    "mathematically stretched configurations are characterized by the ordering @xmath32 if we neglect terms of the order @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ gsg1 ] ) we obtain after one integration with respect to @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an integration constant ( total pressure on the @xmath28-axis ) , which depends parametrically on @xmath28 .",
    "we solve this differential equation by separation @xcite : @xmath37 and fix the constant @xmath38 so that @xmath39 .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to derive the pressure function @xmath40 directly from the observations presently available .",
    "we will therefore choose @xmath40 by a compromise between physical reasoning and mathematical simplicity .",
    "we do not choose pressure functions which have a too simple dependence on @xmath22 like @xmath41 , @xmath22 or @xmath42 because solutions of this type are a ) known to be linearly stable and b ) have already been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a popular and convenient choice is @xmath43 because it corresponds to the physical assumption that the plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium and it has the mathematical advantage that one can find analytical solutions . using @xmath44 where @xmath45 may be a function of @xmath28 and @xmath46 may be positive or negative , we get from equation ( [ gl8 ] ) : @xmath47                                                         \\right\\ }            + \\frac{1}{c}\\log\\left(\\frac{p_0}{k}\\right ) \\label{axz}\\ ] ] the components of the magnetic field are then given by @xmath48 @xmath49 we remark that one can not evaluate @xmath50 and @xmath51 in equation ( [ bx ] ) directly because in general @xmath52 depends on @xmath53 and @xmath54 as well",
    ". the plasma pressure can be obtained from the eq .",
    "( [ druck ] ) @xmath55 and the current density @xmath56 from @xmath57 : @xmath58      the method just outlined has been applied very successfully to calculate the structure of the earth s",
    ". however , since we want to apply this method to describe multiple streamer structures a few details of the method have to be changed though the basic approach stays the same .    in an arcade structure",
    "the direction of the @xmath30 component of the magnetic field changes its sign as one crosses the centre of the arcade . in a triple structure , one will therefore encounter three such changes as one moves across the structure . in a stretched configuration described by the asymptotic expansion procedure , the only possibility to achieve",
    "this is that the current density @xmath56 changes its sign between the streamers , or , in other words , in the central streamer the current flows in the opposite direction with respect to the two outer streamers . in terms of the sign of @xmath30",
    "this means that in order to paste the three arcades continuously together , the @xmath30 component in the central streamer has to change just in the opposite sense to the outer two streamers .    since the current density @xmath56",
    "is directly linked to the plasma pressure by the relation @xmath59 , this implies that the derivative of the pressure with respect to the flux function @xmath22 has to change its sign , too .",
    "we can therefore not use a single exponential function to model the pressure because the exponential function and its derivative have no zero .",
    "the simplest alternative is that we use different pressure functions for the middle ( @xmath60 say ) and for the outer streamers ( @xmath61 ) . in principle",
    ", we could also use a different pressure function for each of the three streamers , but since we do not want to make the model too complicated we assume the structure to be mirror symmetric with respect to the @xmath28-axis for simplicity .    due to the different pressure functions our solution will have two separatrix field lines characterized by @xmath62 which separate the regions of different pressure from each other .",
    "these separatrices have to be calculated self - consistently together with the solution but due to our symmetry assumption we only have to calculate one of those separatrix field lines . in the asymptotic expansion procedure",
    "the location of the separatrix field line will be given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is only varying weakly with @xmath28 .",
    "if we require a smooth transition of magnetic field across the separatrix from the outer to the inner streamer , the pressure functions must be continuous .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath65 for the middle streamer and @xmath66 for the outer streamers , while the coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) are related by @xmath72 on the separatrix labeled by @xmath62 .",
    "this choice has the consequence that the current density @xmath56 has a discontinuity at the separatrix .",
    "we remark , however , that the absolute value of @xmath56 is only rather small at the separatrix and only changes from a small negative to a small positive value and therefore the discontinuity of the current density should not influence the solution structure very much .",
    "we choose @xmath73 to put the centre of the middle streamer on the @xmath28-axis . to calculate the separatrix between the middle and one of the outer streamer we use equation ( [ gl8 ] ) with the form of @xmath40 inside the middle streamer to obtain @xmath74 note that both @xmath75 and @xmath67 may depend weakly on @xmath28 .",
    "if we call the centre of the outer streamer @xmath76 , we can calculate this central field line relative to the separatrix field line again with equation ( [ gl8 ] ) , but this time using @xmath61 and setting @xmath77 : @xmath78 if one takes into consideration that @xmath79 and equation ( [ sep1 ] ) one finds : @xmath80 a sketch of the whole structure is shown in figure [ skizze ] .",
    "we can now calculate @xmath22 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath11 and @xmath56 as functions of @xmath34 and @xmath28 from the equations ( [ axz ] ) , ( [ bz ] ) , ( [ bx ] ) , ( [ pxz ] ) and ( [ jxz ] ) and by using the symmetry properties of these quantities . as an input we need the total pressure @xmath53 which is the same in all three streamers , the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "if gravitation is included , @xmath67 and @xmath68 may depend weakly on @xmath28 , but could be different if we allow different temperatures inside the streamers .",
    "the method as outlined so far neglects that coronal streamers are the source regions of the slow solar wind .",
    "it is an open question if a stationary slow solar wind component exists or whether the slow solar wind is the result of many small eruptions .",
    "recent observations ( schwenn and inhester , private communication 1997 ) seem to favour the second alternative . if that is true , a steady state model providing the start configuration for a time - dependent computation of the eruption process need not include the flow , at least not near the symmetry plane .",
    "nevertheless we want to show how a stationary plasma flow can be included in our model .",
    "it may be relevant for the open field regions at larger distances from the ecliptic , to which we confine the flow .",
    "the inclusion of plasma flow into the asymptotic expansion procedure has been carried out for both incompressible @xcite and compressible flow @xcite .",
    "there are three critical points in the solar wind : the slow magnetosonic point @xmath81 , the alfvn point @xmath82 and the fast magnetosonic point @xmath83 with @xmath84 for the coronal plasma .",
    "if one assumes that the flow velocity at the basis of the corona is less than @xmath81 the solar wind has to pass through all these critical points .",
    "@xcite showed that in stretched configurations the total pressure function @xmath53 is related to the flow velocity .",
    "for @xmath85 the flow velocity decreases with decreasing @xmath53 and for @xmath86 the flow velocity increases with decreasing @xmath53 .",
    "as it is necessary that @xmath53 decreases with respect to @xmath28 to get closed arcade structures , the solar wind velocity should have a minimum at the helmet streamer cusp .",
    "this result is of course only valid if a stationary slow solar wind exists .",
    "the assumption of incompressible flow in the solar wind , however , can not be justified in a strict sense , because generally gravity is not negligible . since in the paper our main emphasis is placed on closed structures without directed flow , this model assumption does not influence our conclusions significantly .",
    "( in fact , all our explicit examples are structures without flow . )",
    "we note that the above mentioned variation of the solar wind velocity remains qualitative valid , if one neglects gravity and assumes incompressible flow .",
    "we will assume that the flow is purely field - aligned and since we will not extend our solution to the first critical point , we will for simplicity make the assumption of the flow being incompressible and subalfvenic .",
    "we mention that , as a useful nice property , such stationary solutions with flow , can be directly calculated by transformation from static solutions @xcite . here",
    "we follow the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ gsg2 ] ) is then substituted by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the alfvn mach number defined by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "note that for incompressible flow both the alfvn mach number and the plasma density are constant along open field lines .    to extend the method outlined so far to include flow on open field lines",
    ", we have to define a second separatrix field line @xmath91 between the regions of open and closed magnetic flux . since there shall be no flow in the closed field line regions , we choose @xmath92 on the left hand side of the separatrix and @xmath93 ( subalfvnic flow ) on the right hand of the separatrix .",
    "in the special case @xmath94 we find with equation ( [ gsg3 ] ) that one can easily include incompressible subalfvenic plasma flow ( @xmath95 ) , if we replace the term @xmath96 in the static theory by @xmath97 .",
    "the location of the separatrix field line @xmath91 could be calculated by a similar procedure as the inner separatrix , but it is more convenient to choose it to be at the same distance from the centre of the outer streamer as the inner separatrix so that we have a symmetric situation again and one finds @xmath98 .",
    "we remark that this condition is necessary if one investigates configurations with a cusp structure .",
    "one can then calculate the shape of the separatrix defined by @xmath99 simply from @xmath100 ( see figure [ skizze ] for illustration ) .",
    "it is possible to extend our method and include magnetic shear writing @xmath101 as : @xmath102 using the @xmath17 component of equation ( [ stat ] ) one finds @xmath103 and instead of ( [ gsg1 ] ) we get : @xmath104 with @xmath105 using the method of asymptotic expansion we get : @xmath106 we remark that the reason for magnetic shear should be a displacement of magnetic foot points and that only closed field lines will be sheared .",
    "we assume @xmath107 for mathematical simplicity .",
    "in general we can not solve equation ( [ scher2 ] ) analytically .",
    "this is only possible if we choose the special case @xmath108 which we will do to illustrate the effect of magnetic shear .",
    "then we get : @xmath109 and we can easily include magnetic shear by substituting @xmath54 by @xmath110 in equation ( [ axz ] ) .",
    "it is possible to investigate other values ( @xmath111 ) numerically , but one can see the main effect of magnetic shear already in this special case .",
    "we calculate triple structures analogous to the method without shear and substitute @xmath112 by @xmath113 .",
    "we have to consider shear only on closed field lines .",
    "we use @xmath114 in the middle streamer , @xmath115 in the outer streamers and @xmath116 on open field lines .",
    "thus there is a jump in @xmath117 and a corresponding jump in the magnetic field at the boundary between outer streamers and open field lines and consequently there is a thin current sheet . unlike the calculations on closed field lines one can not fix @xmath118 .",
    "instead of ( [ gl8 ] ) one has to use : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the value of the last closed field line ( boundary field line between open and closed regions ) .",
    "one finds @xmath98 for configurations with cusp structure .",
    "we remark that violating the condition @xmath121 could still make sense .",
    "for example , one could use @xmath122 but @xmath123 .",
    "of course this mismatch in the value of @xmath117 would have to be compensated by a corresponding mismatch in @xmath30 and this would lead to additional current sheets between the middle and the outer streamers .      in this subsection",
    "we formulate the method in spherical coordinates @xmath124 , which are more realistic to describe the solar corona on scales comparable to or larger than a solar radius .",
    "we assume static @xmath125 configurations and do not consider spatial variation in the @xmath126-direction @xmath127 .",
    "thus we can present the magnetic field as : @xmath128 here @xmath129 is the flux function in spherical coordinates .",
    "we remark that in spherical coordinates the flux function is not identical with a component of the magnetic vector potential .",
    "one finds @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the @xmath126-component of the vector potential @xmath132 .",
    "we find from ( [ stat ] ) that @xmath133 has to obey the equation : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is constant on field lines . with the assumption of a constant temperature and because @xmath136 one finds : @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field perpendicular to the photosphere @xmath139 is much larger than the parallel component @xmath140 .",
    "for simplicity we do not consider magnetic shear here @xmath141 .",
    "stretched configurations are characterized by @xmath142 this approximation is valid for configurations close to the equatorial plane ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath144 has to vary only slowly with respect to @xmath145 .",
    "the second condition limits the outer boundary of our model corona to a few solar radii . as",
    "the observed configurations are indeed concentrated near the equatorial plane and the closed streamer field lines seem to be radially bounded to a few ( about @xmath146 ) solar radii , our asymptotic model should describe these configurations approximately correct .    if we neglect terms of the order @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ gradkugel ] ) we obtain after one integration with respect to @xmath147 : @xmath148 we use ( analogous to our calculations in cartesian geometry ) @xmath149 and solve this differential equation by separation . instead of ( [ axz ] )",
    "we get : @xmath150    we remark that one can not find a one dimensional solution of equation ( [ gradkugel ] ) with @xmath151 like in cartesian geometry .",
    "thus no analogy to the harris sheet in cartesian geometry exists in spherical coordinates .    to calculate triple structures in spherical geometry",
    "one uses a similar procedure as described for cartesian geometry .",

    "it can be seen that the effect of changing the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 stays the same as in the case without cusp .",
    "an increase of the exponent @xmath160 leads to a stronger decrease of @xmath53 as the cusp point is approached from below and this leads to a sharper cusp structure .",

    "we investigate the influence of the solar gravitational field on the structure of the solutions .",
    "though we are still calculating in cartesian geometry we will not take the gravitational force to be constant as it is usually done in cartesian geometry if the length scale under consideration is much smaller than a solar radius ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , but use the more appropriate potential @xmath161 .",
    "together with the assumption of constant temperature we get : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the constant of gravitation , @xmath164 the solar mass , @xmath165 the solar radius and @xmath166 . under the assumption of a pure hydrogen plasma and a constant temperature of @xmath167 k",

    "we remark that this problem is alleviated in spherical geometry which is more realistic anyway ( see section [ seckugel ] )    the inclusion of shear only makes sense on closed field lines .",

    "the inclusion of shear on closed field lines leads to a jump in @xmath30 from a positive to a negative value in the center of the whole configuration ( see figure [ figbz ] b ) ) .",

    "<S> recent observations of the solar corona with the lasco coronagraph on board of the soho spacecraft have revealed the occurrence of triple helmet streamers even during solar minimum , which occasionally go unstable and give rise to particularly huge coronal mass ejections . </S>",
    "<S> we present a method to calculate ( semi-)analytically self - consistent stationary configurations of triple helmet streamers which can serve as input for stability considerations and dynamical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on an asymptotic expansion procedure using the elongated structure of the streamers . </S>",
    "<S> the method is very flexible and can be used in both cartesian and spherical geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effects of magnetic shear , gravity and field - aligned flow on open field lines . </S>",
    "<S> example solutions illustrating the influence of each of these features on the solution structure are presented . </S>"
