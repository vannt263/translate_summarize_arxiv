    "[ cohn ] that the effective network resistance @xmath21  is a monotone function of the individual resistances @xmath20 .",
    "thus , any small change in pipe diameter or pipe length from the minimal resistance configuration - compatible with the constraint - must lead to an increase of the resistances @xmath20 . as a consequence",
    ", the length of each pipe must be as small as possible and its diameter as large as possible , i.e. each channel must be straight with a uniform cross - sectional area .",
    "besides , it can be noticed that a circular cross - sectional area have the specific property of minimizing both the pipe surface area for a fixed volume ( or equivalently maximizing the pipe volume for a fixed surface area ) and the dissipative energy in the channel for a fixed incoming flow - rate in case of poiseuille - flow regime .",
    "we now establish relations between diameters and angles in an optimal network , for a given topology ( meaning that no junction or channel can be added or removed from the network , but the channel lengths and cross - section areas are free to vary ) .",
    "we thus have to minimize the function @xmath26  ( where @xmath27  is a lagrange multiplier ) with respect to the independent variables @xmath28  and @xmath29 , respectively the channel cross - sectional areas and node positions . using cohn s theorem [ cohn ]",

    "this equality , relating angles between adjoining channels to their cross - sectional areas , is similar to a force balance equation , where the weight of the force acting along the channel @xmath39  is directly proportional to @xmath40 . as for murray s law , local optimization principles",

    "all these approaches consist in varying the position of a given junction , while the positions of the other junctions , the network topology , the channel cross - sectional areas , and the flow - rates through every channel are remained fixed .",
    "however , in the context of a global optimization , a change in a node position should alter the flow - rate distribution , and it is therefore to be expected that global minimization of the dissipated energy leads to a different optimal geometry of nodes than in the local optimization context ( p ) .",
    "indeed , the optimal geometry of nodes described by eq . [ angles ] is similar to the one obtained for ( s ) ( when @xmath41 ) or ( v ) ( when @xmath35 ) , but different from ( p ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "the former inequality can be rewritten as : @xmath73 , with @xmath74 . before establishing an",

    "let us choose @xmath77  and @xmath78  such that @xmath79 , what corresponds to the maximum value of the left - hand side of the former equality .",
    "since @xmath80  ( rule 3 . ) , we easily check that both @xmath77  and @xmath78  are positive and lower than @xmath81 , and simple algebra leads to : @xmath82 thus , the resistance variation @xmath71  is negative if and only if:@xmath83 where the functions",
    "@xmath84  and @xmath85  correspond to the respective situations of two adjacent channels crossed by flows in same and opposite directions .",
    "the analysis of @xmath86  and @xmath87  shows that , for any value of @xmath88 , these functions are bounded in the following way : @xmath89  for any value of @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; @xmath90  if @xmath91 , and @xmath92  if @xmath93 .",

    "the new structure is not in a minimal resistance configuration , determined by eqs [ currents ] and [ angles ] , so the `` relaxation '' of the new structure such a configuration implies a further decrease of the effective resistance .",
    "eventually , we can repeat the same reasoning on the @xmath101-fold junction , if @xmath102 .",

    "furthermore , it can be noticed that only two kinds of @xmath105-fold junctions can exist in such a network : either three adjacent channels are crossed by flows of same sign ( and the last flow has an opposed sign ) , or two adjacent channels are crossed by flows with same sign and the two other adjacent channels are crossed by flows with same opposite sign . a @xmath105-fold junction with channels crossed by flows with alternate signs is preferably replaced by two @xmath50-fold junctions , since there is always two adjacent channels crossed by flows with opposite signs and with an angle lower than @xmath106  ( rule 1 . ) . * if @xmath12  and @xmath35 : @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "but we know that there is always two adjacent channels crossed by flows with opposite signs in a @xmath49-fold junction ( rule 2 . ) , with an angle between them lower than @xmath96  ( rule 3 . ) .",
    "so the @xmath49-fold junction is preferably replaced with a @xmath109-fold junction plus a @xmath50-fold junction for any @xmath100 .",

    "but this set of equations applied in a @xmath50-fold junction has only trivial solutions when @xmath110 : either one cross - section is null , or the three channels are colinear .",
    "we conclude that sources are directly connected to the wells , with no intermediate junction , in a minimal resistance network preserving total channel volume and in case of plug - flow regime .    as a concluding remark for this section , we point out that the same reasoning may be used on the total channel length variation instead of resistance variation ( steiner tree problem ) .",
    "in that case , we obtain that links meet at threefold junctions ( with equal angles of @xmath111 ) in a length - minimizing network .",
    "we compare our results with a simple example : two sources and two wells placed at the corner of a rectangle , as depicted on fig .",

    "such a local adaptive process may take place during ontogeny of natural networks .",

    "validity of murray s law for vascular system of plants is more controversial @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , mostly because of the underlying theoretical assumptions in the original derivation of murray s law , and of the particular structure of veins in vascular system of plants .",

    "so petiole ( or major vein ) and stomata play alternatively roles of sources and wells for the leaf .",
    "an outer layer of cells , called the bundle sheath , surrounds the vascular tissues .",
    "although this layer is not fully impermeable , the leaky radial flow is small when compared with the axial flow , except for the minor veins @xcite@xcite . for these veins",
    ", leakage is very important and the pressure field and nutrient concentration nearby are almost uniform .",
    "kull and herbig @xcite investigated on leaf topology of several species .",
    "they observed that leaf venations preferably show trivalent nodes with six neighbors , and noticed that this geometry is typical of self - generating structures like bubble floats . in a recent study , s. bohn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed geometry of junctions in the leaf venation of various species .",
    "they observed that angles between veins are very well defined and that a vectorial balance equation comparable to eq . [ angles ] can be established , where the weight of each vector is directly proportional to the vein radius ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "comparison of bohn _ et al . _",
    "observations with our optimization principles suggest then that structure of leaf venation corresponds to a minimization of the resistance for a fixed total channel surface area ( or minimization of surface area for a fixed value of resistance ) .",
    "this result is coherent with the idea of a predominant building cost of the bundle sheath cells over those of the vascular tissues @xcite@xcite . taking @xmath41  and comparing eq .",
    "[ diameters ] with experimental studies of murray s law leads to a value of @xmath47  between @xmath127  and @xmath128 , meaning that flow in veins is nearly poiseuille - like .",
    "note it is assumed in the theory that all channels have same resistivity @xmath11",
    ". however , density of xylem and phloem tissues in a leaf vein might be a function of the vein diameter as well .",
    "this variation of the resistivity is then include in the coefficient @xmath47 , what could explain the slight difference observed between the experimental value of @xmath47 and the theoretical value for a poiseuille - flow regime .",
    "all these results and the presence of trivalent nodes suggest then that structure of leaf venation correspond to minimal resistance configuration preserving the total surface area and nearly poiseuille flow profile .",
    "the measure of the scaling - law between the hydraulic resistance and the total channel volume or surface area might be an additional way to test this conjecture .                                      note that a fixed total length is not a pertinent constraint , unless channel cross - sectional areas are bounded ; otherwise one could built channels with infinitely large cross - sections and the minimal resistance value would be trivialy zero .",
    "it is also obvious that there are no global maximum , since one can built a network with infinitely long and indefinitely thin channels ( so that value of @xmath24  is preserved ) and whose resistance is infinitely large ."
