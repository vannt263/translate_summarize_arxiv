    "dopants play a pivotal role in many correlated electron systems .",
    "their concentration determines the electronic density , the small changes of which can dramatically modify the ground state and the physical properties .",
    "@xcite at the same time , dopants may impact on electronic properties via lattice strain or electrostatic effects .",
    "for instance , the random distribution of dopants produces nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity in some of the high @xmath7 cuprates  @xcite , chemical ordering of pr suppresses large - scale electronic phase separation in maganites  @xcite or charge ordering in coo@xmath1 layers intertwines with ordering of the mobile na@xmath8 ions in na@xmath9coo@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    in the high temperature superconductor yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath10 , o dopants can be made to order into different sequences of oxygen - full and oxygen - empty chains .",
    "this makes yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 by far the cleanest family of high-@xmath7 cuprates and thus a model system .",
    "the so - called ortho - ii order in which each full chain is adjacent to two empty chains ( fig .",
    "1a ) is of considerable interest because it is the simplest and the best - ordered structure .",
    "@xcite the particularly low level of disorder that can be achieved in the ortho - ii phase has played a pivotal role in the discoveries of fermi - surface reconstruction  @xcite and charge order  @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not render the question of the concentration and the nature of the oxygen defects illegitimate : first , since variations of @xmath11 in the oxygen concentration may produce substantial changes in the electronic properties , @xmath12 needs to be accurately measured and controlled , especially when comparing measurements performed on crystals from different groups or from different batches .",
    "second , reducing @xmath12 below the theoretically - ideal ortho - ii composition @xmath13 not only changes the hole doping but also inevitably introduces oxygen vacancies , thus disorder .",
    "disentangling these two effects is likely to be important .",
    "this is particularly true near @xmath14 where sudden changes in the electronic properties  @xcite give clues on the interplay between different electronic orders  @xcite .",
    "finally , there is also evidence that oxygen disorder has an impact on the phenomenology of charge ordering  @xcite and more broadly on quasiparticle scattering  @xcite , even in the best ortho - ii samples .",
    "therefore , clarifying the concentration and type of oxygen defects in the chain layer remains an important task , even ( and perhaps especially ) in clean yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 samples .    in this article , we use nmr spectroscopy to study the different cu sites in the ortho - ii structure of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 : cu(1f ) sites in the oxygen - full chains , cu(1e ) sites in the empty chains ( see fig  1a ) as well as planar cu(2f ) and cu(2e ) sites , which are connected to cu(1f ) and cu(1e ) , respectively , via an apical oxygen .",
    "the observation that the nmr signal associated with each of these crystallographic sites actually consists of several inequivalent sites provides us with microscopic information on the concentration and the spatial distribution of oxygen defects in the chain layer .",
    "the main characteristics of the high quality , untwinned , single crystals studied here are summarized in table i.    @xmath0cu nmr spectra were obtained by sweeping the frequency at a fixed magnetic field value ( @xmath15  t , aligned along the crystalline @xmath16-axis ) and by adding the fourier transforms of the spin - echo signal recorded for regularly - spaced frequency values .",
    "measurement of the spin - echo decay as a function of the time @xmath17 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 pulses showed a gaussian - type decay for all cu(1e ) peaks , with @xmath20 values ranging from 900  @xmath21s ( left peak in fig .",
    "[ comparison]b ) to 650  @xmath21s ( right peak ) .",
    "therefore , for cu(1e ) spectra measured with @xmath22  @xmath21s , the @xmath20 correction to the intensity is entirely negligible . for cu(1f ) , on the other hand , @xmath20 corrections are necessary ( see later ) .",
    "any local change in the spatial configuration of oxygen ions in the chain layer is susceptible to affect the nmr resonance frequency of the nearby sites .",
    "this site differentiation may arise from two channels : the magnetic hyperfine interaction and the electric quadrupole interaction .",
    "the magnetic hyperfine interaction ( between nuclear and electronic spins ) is responsible for a shift @xmath23 of the three lines for each @xmath0cu site .",
    "recall that because @xmath0cu has a nuclear spin @xmath24 , the nmr spectra consist of a central line ( @xmath25=-1/2 to 1/2 transition ) and two `` quadrupole '' satellites ( @xmath25=-3/2 to -1/2 and @xmath25=+1/2 to + 3/2 transitions ) .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples of full @xmath0cu nmr spectra . in the cuprates",
    ", @xmath26 is determined by the spin susceptibility on a given nuclear site as well as on its nearest neighbors ( dipolar coupling to more distant sites is negligible ) .",
    "the electric quadrupole interaction is the interaction between the ( quadrupole moment of the ) nucleus and the electric - field - gradient ( efg ) .",
    "when it is a perturbation with respect to the zeeman interaction ( which is the case here at 15 t ) , any efg change at a given site modifies the position of the central line of this site ( only to second order ) as well as the separation ( @xmath27 ) between its quadrupole satellites ( first - order correction ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electric quadrupole moment of the nucleus , @xmath30 is the largest component of the electric - field - gradient ( efg ) tensor ( @xmath31 is the electrostatic potential ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the applied magnetic field with respect to the principal axes of the efg tensor and @xmath34 is the asymmetry parameter of the efg tensor  @xcite .",
    "the difference in efg created by the presence or the absence of oxygen is mainly what makes cu(1e ) to be distinguishable from cu(1f ) and cu(2e ) to be distinguishable from cu(2f ) in the nmr spectra of ortho - ii samples .",
    "@xcite      we expect that the main source of defects in our samples lies in the deviation from the theoretically - ideal ortho - ii concentration @xmath13 . on general grounds , the same interactions that favor oxygen order should work against having lone , random , defects .",
    "some indication of oxygen clustering has indeed been obtained in ortho - i samples .",
    "@xcite for @xmath35 , clustering of the extra @xmath36 oxygens into full chains ( or fragments thereof ) is to be expected from the manifest propensity to systematically order at higher oxygen concentrations .",
    "indeed , new ordered structures ( of period-8 , 5 or 3 ) are stabilized for @xmath37  @xcite .    for @xmath38 , on the other hand , clustering of the @xmath39 vacancies into empty chains",
    "may not be significant since ortho - ii order never transforms into another ordered phase on decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "lone , random , vacancies may thus be dominant for @xmath38 .",
    "note that the interstitial position in - between chains is unoccupied and that phase separation , while possible in principle , will be shown to be inconsistent with our results . in all cases ,",
    "o vacancies should affect the efg at both cu(1e ) and cu(1f ) sites nearby and thus have signatures in the nmr spectra .",
    "the main results of this study are shown in figs . 2 - 4 . basically , we find that the ideal ortho - ii structure ( namely , single cu(1e ) , cu(1f ) , cu(2e ) and cu(2f ) sites ) is observed in _ none _ of our samples . specifically :",
    "@xmath40 all samples , both @xmath5 and @xmath41 , show several cu(1f ) sites ( fig .",
    "[ cu1f ] ) that might be related to the existence of ( fragments of ) extra full chains .",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath42 , the deviations from ideal ortho - ii order turn out to be extremely reproducible from one sample to another ( fig .  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 crystals with @xmath5 show several inequivalent cu(1e ) sites ( fig .",
    "[ cu1e ] ) , which can be explained by the presence of lone oxygen vacancies in filled chains .    in the following , we discuss these results in more detail .",
    "cu(1f ) central line for three different values of the oxygen concentration @xmath12 at @xmath43  k. besides the main site near 170.3  mhz , at least three other sites are observed on the low frequency side ( marked by arrows ) .",
    "intensities have been normalized by the sample weight but not by @xmath20 ( which , for any given peak , hardly varies between the three samples ) .",
    "the main peak has shorter @xmath20 than the side peaks but if intensities are renormalized by @xmath20 values.,width=278 ]    let us first consider the concentration @xmath44 for which a non - zero nmr intensity is visible on the low - frequency side of the regular cu(1f ) central line ( fig .  [ cu1f ] and [ comparison]b , e ) . the main difference between these additional sites and the main line resides in their knight shift value  @xcite .    in a previous study , similar cu(1f )",
    "nmr signal was initially ascribed to sites near the chain ends  @xcite . indeed , because oxygen vacancies break up full chains into fragments , chain ends are expected to experience charge ( friedel ) and spin - density oscillations that decay away from a vacancy , along the chain  @xcite .",
    "however , a subsequent theoretical work  @xcite ruled out this interpretation ( such oscillations do exist but they only contribute to the symmetric broadening of the main line ) and instead proposed that the additional signal actually corresponds to a different valence state , namely cu@xmath45 ions .",
    "however , our spectra in fig .  [ cu1f ] show that this anomalous intensity consists of not one but at least three different peaks in addition to the main line .",
    "furthermore , all these peaks broaden and shift on cooling ( not shown ) , indicating that none of them can be ascribed to a non - magnetic valence configuration .        in principle ,",
    "insight into the origin of the different peaks can be gained from their relative areas . here",
    ", however , we can not reliably estimate the relative abundance of the different sites as a fraction of the cu(1f ) sites appears not to be observed , even in the @xmath44 sample .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ cu1f ] that shows small cu(1f ) peaks at the very same positions in the @xmath46 and 6.45 samples as in the 6.55 sample .",
    "it is clear that the main peak almost entirely looses its intensity upon decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "this is because some of the sites have @xmath20 values shorter than the spectrometer dead time .",
    "the loss of intensity is clear for the 6.45 and 6.47 samples by comparison with the 6.55 sample , but it is also present , to a lesser extent , in the 6.55 sample itself .",
    "therefore , the relative abundance of the different cu(1f ) sites can not be reliably extracted , even in the @xmath44 sample .",
    "nevertheless , it should be clear that the additional cu(1f ) lines can not correspond to sites near lone vacancies in full - chains or near lone extra oxygen in empty chains .",
    "first , the relative intensities of the side peaks ( which all have similar @xmath20 values longer than @xmath20 of the main peak ) do not match the calculated number of cu(1f ) sites having @xmath47 random vacancies as nearest neighbors ( fig .",
    "[ cu2 ] ) .",
    "second , such lone defects should be visible in cu(1e ) nmr , which is not the case in the 6.55 sample to within our detection limit of @xmath481% ( see fig .",
    "[ cu1e ] ) .",
    "the only anomalous signal found in the cu(1e ) spectra of the 6.55 sample is a small peak ( asterisk in fig .",
    "[ comparison]a ) that amounts to @xmath484% of the main peak intensity .",
    "its origin is undetermined yet ; it could be related to the anomalous cu(1f ) peaks .",
    "a natural candidate to explain extra cu(1f ) peaks is oxygen `` over - stoichiometry '' .",
    "indeed , diffraction studies have demonstrated that ortho - ii order is actually strongest ( _ i.e. _ has largest amplitude and longest correlation length ) for @xmath42 rather than for the theoretically optimal value @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite we know that our crystal has optimal ortho - ii order , and therefore has this particular @xmath42 concentration , for several reasons : 1 ) it shows the narrowest nmr line widths of all the samples we have investigated , 2 ) analysis of the signal intensity is consistent with @xmath49 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , 3 ) crystals from the same batch show particularly strong quantum oscillations as well as particularly sharp transitions in sound - velocity measurements  @xcite , and",
    "4 ) these features are perfectly reproducible in several crystals with @xmath50 ( we shall return to this point below ) .",
    "we conclude that the additional cu(1f ) sites most likely reside in extra full chains ( which makes them essentially invisible from cu(1e ) nmr ) , even though we neither have a clear picture nor an unambiguous site assignment .",
    "we speculate that the different nmr sites could correspond to fragments of different lengths . in the @xmath44 sample ,",
    "these extra full - chains naturally account for the extra 0.05 oxygen needed to achieve optimal ordering with respect to the ideal 6.50 concentration .",
    "nonetheless , these extra fragments of full chains turn out to be present in samples with @xmath5 as well",
    ". we shall show below that cu(1e ) nmr data also ( indirectly ) support the hypothesis of extra full chains .",
    "the @xmath51 crystal was grown in vancouver while the @xmath44 crystal was grown in stuttgart . nonetheless , as fig .",
    "[ comparison ] shows , all deviations of the lineshapes from a simple gaussian or lorentzian , even the subtlest ones , are identical in the two samples .",
    "this is equally true for cu(1e ) and cu(1f ) as well as for cu(2e ) and cu(2f ) signals .",
    "this observation is perfectly consistent with the idea of well - defined , systematic , thus `` intrinsic '' , oxygen disorder near @xmath44 .",
    "actually , this particular oxygen disorder is very likely to be present throughout the phase diagram of underdoped yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , whatever the ordered phase : it is known that ortho - viii and ortho - iii orders are stabilized for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , rather than for the expected values @xmath54 and 6.67 .",
    "this again suggests the presence of `` extra '' 0.05 - 0.08 oxygen in the chains .",
    "this result implies that oxygen disorder will always limit the cdw correlation length or the electronic mean free path , whatever the quality of the samples .",

    "this indicates that these sites mostly differ by their quadrupolar parameters ( quadrupole frequency @xmath59 and/or to asymmetry parameter @xmath34 ) rather than by their knight shifts .",
    "given that the positions of the additional cu(1e ) satellites correspond to relatively minor changes of @xmath27 with respect to the main line ( representing cu(1e ) far from any defect ) , we assume that the principal axis of their efg tensor lies along the @xmath16-axis , as for the main site , namely @xmath60 in eqn .  1 .",
    "therefore , the differentiation seen here arises from distinct values of @xmath61 and no information regarding possible differences of @xmath34 values can be gained from the spectra .    as mentioned above ,",

    "using @xmath75 , on the other hand , leads to less consistent numbers .",
    "it should be noted that there exist different configurations producing cu(1e ) sites with two nearest - neighbor vacancies ( see fig .",

    "nonetheless , we observe that the change in @xmath77 is a relatively small effect ( @xmath78  % between the first ( @xmath79 ) and second ( @xmath80 ) peaks ) , and is twice larger between the first and third ( @xmath81 ) peaks ( see appendix ) .",
    "this suggests that the changes in @xmath77 are , to first approximation , proportional to the number of nearest - neighbor vacancies , regardless of their location .",
    "previous nmr studies for @xmath82 reported very similar cu(1e ) nmr spectra ( @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "accordingly , the different cu(1e ) sites were assigned to the three following configurations : empty chains surrounded by two full chains ( pristine ortho - ii ) , pairs of adjacent empty chains and sets of three adjacent empty chains .",
    "however , the cu(1e ) and cu(2 ) line intensities ( fig .  [ probabilities ] ) calculated in such an hypothesis would require a significantly lower oxygen content to be consistent with the data .",
    "therefore , generalized clustering into very long chains appears to be inconsistent with the quantitative success of the model of random vacancies .",
    "furthermore , the values of the linewidth and of the nmr relaxation times @xmath83 and @xmath20 of cu(1f ) sites in the @xmath44 sample are notably different from those in the two samples with more vacancies  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with random vacancies significantly reducing the average length of the full - chain fragments .",
    "some oxygen clustering may be present but this is not what differentiates the cu(1e ) sites in nmr and it is not crucial for determining the vacancy concentration in the full chains .",
