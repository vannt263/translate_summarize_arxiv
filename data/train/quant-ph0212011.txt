    "the subject of decoherence of a quantum system has witnessed a renewed interest in the last years .",
    "in addition to being central to our understanding of the transition from quantum to classical physics@xcite , it is of outmost importance in the blooming field of quantum information@xcite , where decoherence or dephasing represent loss of information .    a quantum superposition state `` collapses '' due to the dissipative interaction with the environment ( e.g. in the case of trapped atoms",
    ", the coupling to the electro - magnetic vacuum leads to spontaneous scattering of photons ) .",
    "this interaction is irreversible in nature . on the other hand ,",
    "the macroscopic ( ensemble averaged ) response of a quantum system prepared in a superposition state decays due to the dephasing resulting from local variations in the evolution of the system ( e.g. inhomogeneous broadening ) . by stimulating an effective  time reversal",
    " , revivals of coherence in dephased systems ( at least partial ones ) have been reported for spin echoes @xcite and photon echoes @xcite , and more recently for a motional wave packet echo using ultra cold atoms in a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the technique of `` echo spectroscopy '' on ultra cold atoms trapped in an optical dipole trap , which utilizes a micro wave ( mw ) analog to the photon echo @xcite .",
    "we show that this technique can be used to study the quantum dynamics of trapped atoms , even when many states are thermally populated .",
    "we show that the stability of eigenstates under perturbations of the hamiltonian plays an important role for the echo signal .",
    "numerical calculations of this quantity for an atom - optics bunimovich stadium are presented .",
    "next , by overcoming the inhomogeneous shift , which is the main limiting factor for the coherence time in dipole traps @xcite , echo spectroscopy opens the way for using dipole trapped atoms in quantum information and possibly for high precision spectroscopy .",
    "finally , our analysis leads to a proposal of a dephasing free dipole trap .",
    "one of the most widely used mw spectroscopy techniques is the so called ramsey method @xcite .",
    "it works on two level atoms after the following principle : the atoms are prepared in one of their two states ( denoted @xmath0 ) .",
    "next , a short mw - pulse close to resonance transfers the atoms into a coherent superposition state of the two levels ( this pulse is usually called a @xmath1 pulse ) , which is left to evolve for a certain time , without mw - irradiation . due to the detuning between the atomic resonance frequency and the mw - frequency",
    ", the time evolution will cause an atomic phase to develop in the rotating frame of the mw field .",
    "a second @xmath1-pulse maps this phase onto populations of the two levels , which can be detected .",
    "if the mw - frequency is scanned , this phase difference is scanned , and sinusoidal oscillations in the populations , known as ramsey fringes , are seen . when ramsey spectroscopy is performed on an ensemble of",
    "inhomogeneously broadened two level atoms , each atom will acquire a slightly different phase in the dark period , causing the macroscopic fringe contrast to decay when increasing the time between the @xmath1-pulses . thus the ramsey fringe contrast is a measure of the dehpasing of the system .",
    "the dephasing can be reversed by stimulating a _",
    "coherence echo_. this is done by adding a population inverting pulse ( a @xmath2-pulse ) between the two @xmath1-pulses .",
    "if the @xmath2-pulse is added exactly in the middle between the two @xmath3-pulses each part of the superposition state generated by the first @xmath1-pulse will have spent an equal amount of time in both levels at the time of the second @xmath4-pulse , and will therefore be exactly in phase with each other .",
    "this means that a coherence echo have appeared at the time of the second @xmath1-pulse even for a system that have dephased completely before the @xmath5-pulse . when measuring the populations the coherence echo is therefore observed by seeing that all the atoms have returned to the initial state after the @xmath1-@xmath5-@xmath6-pulse sequence . if the time ( @xmath7 ) between the first @xmath6 and the @xmath5-pulse is kept constant , and the time between the @xmath5 and the second @xmath1-pulse ( @xmath8 ) is swept , the coherence echo is seen as a decrease in the population of @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fi1 ] ) .",
    "the population @xmath11 for @xmath10 is referred in what follows as the `` echo signal '' , where @xmath12 indicates full revival of coherence and @xmath13 indicates complete dephasing .",
    "experimental data shown in this paper is taken using two hyperfine levels of the ground state of @xmath14 atoms trapped in a dipole trap .",
    "these two levels ( @xmath15 , denoted @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , denoted @xmath18 ) are separated by the energy difference @xmath19 where @xmath20 ghz is the hyperfine splitting .",
    "for spectroscopy of trapped atoms we must consider the entire hamiltonian including both the internal and the external degrees of freedom of the atom . since the dipole potential is inversely proportional to the trap laser detuning @xmath21 @xcite",
    "there is a slightly different potential for atoms in different hyperfine states for our experimental parameters . ] and the hamiltonian of our trapped two level atom can be written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the atomic center of mass momentum and @xmath24 [ @xmath25 the external potential for an atom in state @xmath16 [ @xmath9 ] , much smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "the atoms are initially prepared in their internal ground state @xmath0 .",
    "their total wave function can be written as @xmath28 @xmath29 , where @xmath29 represents the motional ( external degree of freedom ) part of their wave function .",
    "if a mw field close to resonance with @xmath30 is applied , transitions between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian corresponding to different internal states , can be driven .",
    "the small size of optical traps ( typically on the order of @xmath31 @xmath32 or less ) as compared to the mw wavelength ( @xmath3310 cm ) , ensures that the momentum of the mw photon can be neglected ( lamb - dicke regime @xcite ) .",
    "even though the internal states of the atoms are described as a two - level system eq.[hami ] describes a multi - level system in two energy manifolds . when the mw - field is added to the hamiltonian in eq.[hami ] and the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    "is formulated it is seen that the transition matrix elements between eigenstates of eq .",
    "[ hami ] are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the free space matrix element for the internal state transition , and @xmath36 is the overlap between the initial motional eigenstate of @xmath37 and an eigenstate of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , when a strong and short mw pulse is applied , the motional part of the initial wave function is simply projected into @xmath39 . if @xmath40 then clearly @xmath41 . for a small enough potential difference ( perturbation ) @xmath42 the approximation @xmath43 is valid . in the general case , a projected eigenstate of @xmath37 will not be an eigenstate of @xmath38 , and therefore will evolve in the new potential , causing the overlap @xmath44 to decay ( @xmath45 @xmath46 ) .    ) measured as a function of time between @xmath47-pulse and second @xmath48-pulse ( @xmath49 ) for fixed @xmath50 . a dip in @xmath11",
    "is seen , showing a `` coherence echo '' .",
    "@xmath51,width=288 ]    if ramsey spectroscopy is performed on atoms initially prepared in an eigenstate of @xmath24 characterized by the quantum number @xmath52 , then the probability to be in the internal state @xmath9 after the @xmath53-@xmath54 pulse sequence can be shown to be : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mw - frequency , @xmath57 is the time between the pulses , and @xmath58 is a generalized , state - dependent , detuning ( it reduces to the detuning when only two levels are coupled by the mw - field ) , defined so @xmath59 is real and positive .",
    "scanning @xmath56 for a fixed @xmath60 yields the usual ramsey fringes with a contrast given by @xmath61 . since @xmath62 this contrast serves as a measure of the stability of the quantum evolution under a small perturbation in the hamiltonian @xcite .    in our experiments atoms",
    "are not initially in a single motional eigenstate , but a thermal ensemble of atoms incoherently populates many eigenstates . the total population in @xmath9 is then given by an average of @xmath11 over the initial thermal ensemble .",
    "@xmath58 depends on the initial state , and due to this spread in detuning the fringe contrast of the ensemble - averaged @xmath11 decays rapidly even when @xmath63 for all populated states ( note the analogy to the inhomogeneous broadening of two level atoms ) .",
    "hence , the decay of the fringe contrast in ramsey spectroscopy of thermal trapped atoms does not teach us anything about the dynamics in the trap ( @xmath64 ) but simply measures the spread in @xmath58 .",
    "this spread also limits the interrogation time for high precision spectroscopy .",
    "equation [ hami ] indicates that if a special trap can be constructed so that @xmath58 is independent of @xmath52 , then the fast decay of the ramsey fringes will be suppressed .",
    "an example of such a dephasing - free trap is an inverted pyramid of exponentially decaying evanescent waves , in which gravity provides the vertical confinement .",
    "this trap have the special feature that @xmath65 is exactly equal to @xmath66 shifted along the vertical axis .",
    "therefore all eigenenergies are shifted the same amount and @xmath58 is indeed a fixed number .",
    "this makes such a trap an excellent candidate for high precision spectroscopy .",
    "note , that in order to use traps for this kind of measurements , the suppression of the relative spread in @xmath58 , should be accompanied by a reduction in their average value , e.g. by increasing the trap s detuning . since the proposed trap is a `` dark optical trap '' , where atoms are trapped by repulsive light forces mainly in the dark @xcite , hence minimizing the amount of interaction with the trap s light , then in addition to being dephasing - free it has also a low photon scattering rate ( which will now be the limiting factor for the coherence time ) and a small @xmath58 .",
    "apart from using special geometries a possible solution to the above mentioned dephasing is to reverse it using `` echo spectroscopy '' by adding a mw @xmath5-pulse between the two @xmath67 pulses . @xmath11 for atoms initially populating a single eigenstate then becomes : @xmath68   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ 1-% % tcimacro{\\func{re}}% % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\rm re}% % endexpansion \\left ( e^{i\\frac{e_{n}^{1}}{\\hbar } \\tau } \\left\\langle \\varphi _ { n}\\left ( t=0\\right ) \\mid \\varphi _ { n}\\left ( t=\\tau \\right ) \\right\\rangle \\right ) % \\right ]   \\label{formel1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a new basis defined by @xmath70 @xmath46 , and @xmath71 @xmath72 . @xmath11 no longer depends on @xmath56 and @xmath27 and therefore not on any @xmath58 but only on the dynamics is often a good approximation @xcite , but the limitations of it is not yet known to the authors . ] .",

    "the procedure is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the echo signal @xmath11 was measured as a function of time between pulses for different wavelengths of the trap laser , thereby changing the perturbation strength @xmath87 , while keeping the trap depth constant by adjusting the power of the trap beam .",
    "for a small perturbation a good echo ( @xmath75 ) is seen independent of the time between pulses ( see fig . [ fi2 ] ) . for larger",
    "perturbation damped oscillations to a level smaller than 1/2 are seen .",
    "an even larger perturbation causes a complete decay of the echo coherence ( @xmath79 ) followed by partial revivals , which are clear signatures of the dynamics .",
    "two revivals ( of different amplitude ) are seen when the time between mw pulses is close to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , where @xmath90 ms is the measured radial oscillation frequency of the trap ( the longitudinal oscillation frequency is @xmath91 @xmath92 , hence the longitudinal motion is essentially fixed for the duration of our experiment ) .",
    "the revival at @xmath88 corresponds to wavepacket oscillations excited by the symmetric change of the trap strength , and the stronger revival at @xmath89 corresponds also to the vertical sloshing of wavepackets induced by the vertical shift of the gravito - optical potential for @xmath93 compared to @xmath0 ( in our experiments this vertical shift is of the order of a few @xmath94 , as compared to a trap cloud size of @xmath86 @xmath32 ! ) .",
    "the lack of complete revival at @xmath89 is mainly due to anharmonicity of the gaussian trap , but also small amount of decoherence due to spontaneous scattering of photons and noise may contribute .",

    "if the time between pulses is large enough so the dynamics has dephased completely between them , then the contributions from other states will average to zero .",

    "note , that since a large @xmath108 also implies a large survival probability as defined in @xcite , it also plays an important role in quantum dynamical studies .",
    "atom optic billiards are good candidates for trapping atoms for high precision spectroscopy , since the interaction with the trap light is small because atoms are confined mainly in the dark @xcite .",
    "they have been used to study dynamics in the past , and have experimentally been demonstrated to display the features of ideal billiards , @xcite . for our calculations",

    "perturbations of @xmath66 that can be described as a change of coordinate system such as rotation , translation ( of importance to the inverted pyramid discussed above ) and dilation will give exceptional high @xmath116 .",
    "intuitively this is clear since an eigenstate of @xmath37 under these three perturbations is also an eigenstate of @xmath38 rotated , translated or dilated respectively .",

    "this is best approximated by moving the billiard s wall a fixed distance perpendicular to itself .",
    "this perturbation , that we name  the physical perturbation  , can be viewed as a dilation followed by a negative stretch , and it shows features between those of dilation and stretch ( fig .

    "but its fulfilment for a chaotic system where variables can not be separated is less obvious unless the above arguments are considered .     as a function of dilation factor for eigenstates with @xmath104 in a stadium .",
