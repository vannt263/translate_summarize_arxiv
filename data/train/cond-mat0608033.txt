    "@xcite the large variation in the peak intensity is due to the extinction effect mentioned above , and can not be ascribed solely to the linear attenuation of the incident and scattered neutron beams as they traverse through the pmn crystal .",
    "the variation of bragg intensity is important , however , as it can be used to locate the surface of the sample on the translation axis .",
    "the crystal surface should correspond to the translation that gives the maximum intensity as this will be when the gauge volume lies completely below the crystal surface . at this point ,",
    "the scattering volume is a maximum , while the effects from extinction are minimal .",
    "the bottom panel shows a strong variation in the lattice spacing spanning several hundred microns ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , and thus confirms the existence of a skin effect in pure pmn",
    ". it thus appears to be the case that the skin is not `` thin '' in pmn ; rather the crystal structures of the bulk and skin are both cubic , and there is a substantial near surface strain .",

    "the location of the crystal surface is indicated by the vertical dashed line.,width=226 ]    all of the residual stress measurements presented so far were performed at room temperature .",
    "figure  13 shows data obtained in a manner identical to that in the bottom panel of fig .  12 , but at three higher temperatures , namely 400  k , 500  k , and 700  k. the striking aspect of these data is the reversal of the strain minimum apparent at 300  k in fig .  12 , which slowly evolves into a maximum at 700  k in the bottom panel of fig .  13 .",
    "while the number of temperatures reported here are insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions about this effect , it is very interesting to note that the burns temperature @xmath56 , below which local regions of randomly oriented polar order on a nanometer scale first appear ,  @xcite lies between 600  k and 700  k. it is tempting to speculate that these polar nanoregions might have some relationship to the skin , and that they may also play an important role in the invar - like thermal expansion observed from 10  k to 400  k.",
    "the combination of x - ray and neutron measurements presented here provide conclusive proof of a significant surface layer in single crystal specimens of both pzn-@xmath0pt and pmn-@xmath0pt systems .",
    "the presence of this skin has led to incorrect phase assignments in the phase diagrams of both systems inasmuch as no rhombohedral phase is present at sufficiently low pt concentrations in either case , the low - temperature phase remaining cubic .",
    "a crossover to a low - temperature rhombohedral phase does take place in pzn-@xmath0pt between @xmath57 and @xmath58% whereas a similar crossover occurs in the pmn-@xmath0pt system between @xmath59%  and @xmath60% .",
    "@xcite that the skin effect persists over such a large temperature range , and that the skin thickness spans many tens of microns , are extremely unusual . in the case of the second length scale phenomena observed in tb and srtio@xmath6 , the anomalous extra component in the critical scattering associated with a phase transition",
    "was also observed over a large depth of order 100  @xmath1 m , but it persisted only over a very limited temperature range .",
    "@xcite in some of these relaxor compounds , the skin and crystal bulk could exhibit different crystal structures ( pzn and pmn-10%pt ) , while in others they possess the same structure ( cubic or rhombohedral ) , but with either different lattice spacings ( pmn ) or different sized rhombohedral distortions ( pzn-4.5%pt and pzn-8%pt ) .",
    "some logical questions for future study are whether or not the skin varies with electric field ?",
    "if so does it get bigger or smaller ?",
    "such studies are in progress , including one to examine the field - induced transition in pmn with high-@xmath25 resolution , as well as the effects on the strong diffuse scattering .",
