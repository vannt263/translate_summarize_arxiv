    "in the past twenty years there has been a fruitful collaboration between theoretical physicists and researchers from the field of combinatorial optimization on the determination of the global energy - minimum ( ground state ) in various spin - glass models .",
    "the observation , that the ground state of the ising - model can be found by solving an certain maxcut - problem , has drawn the attention of physicists to the methods developed in graph theory @xcite .",
    "conversely this application has animated the research on the maxcut - problem @xcite itself .",
    "it the same spirit it was shown , that in the context of the random - field - ising - model the maxflow - problem arises @xcite .",
    "the _ solid - on - solid ( sos ) model _ , on which we will comment here , is a microscopic approach to describe the aggregation of atoms on a crystalline substrate .",
    "in contrast to the above mentioned ising - models , where the dynamic variables can take on only two values , in the sos - model these variables are integer valued . at first sight",
    "this fact seems to complicate the optimization problem . however , similar to the ising - model , the underlying structure can be represented by a graph .",
    "we will show in this paper , that in the planar case the problem of minimizing the surface - energy can be reduced to the problem of finding a network - circulation , that minimizes a convex objective function .",
    "the growth of surfaces is a subject of intense research in chemistry and solid state physics .",
    "a deeper understanding of the relevant processes has applications in the fabrication of semiconductors and various other fields where the precise shape of the surface is crucial @xcite . in the simple approach taken by the sos - model the lattice structure of real crystals",
    "is taken into account by subdividing the surface into discrete sites ( e.g.  unit - squares ) on which particles , modeled by unit cubes , can aggregate @xcite .",
    "there are several possible parametrizations of the model .",
    "the one which is commonly used for theoretical investigations yields the surface - energy    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the height of the surface at site @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicates all pairs of nearest neighbor sites on e.g.  a square lattice , mimicking the crystalline structure .",
    "obviously the ground state of this model is flat , i.e.  @xmath4 for all @xmath2 .",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to a roughening transition at some temperature above which the height - height correlation function increases logarithmically with the distance .",
    "one assumption of this model is the flatness of the underlying substrate , i.e.  a bulk - ordered crystal . due to the presence of quenched defects one should consider the intriguing question of what the effect of a disordered substrate on the thermodynamic ( and non - equilibrium growth ) properties of the surface might be @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite to introduce a disordered substrate into the model ( [ eq : sosmodel ] ) by providing each of the height variables with a real valued offset @xmath5 , which is generally chosen to be from @xmath6 $ ] :    @xmath7    this model has some new features not contained in the original one . the influence of the disorder tends to roughen the surface _ also at low temperatures_. in particular a new phase has been predicted @xcite , where height - height correlations diverge more strongly with the distance than logarithmically . since this is a low temperature phase the properties of the ground state of ( [ eq : sosmodel ] ) with ( [ eq : height ] ) , which is no longer trivial due to the competition between the elastic term @xmath8 and the random offsets @xmath9 , are of crucial interest .    the paper is organized as follows :",
    "section [ sec : reduction ] introduces the reduction to a convex network - flow problem and in section [ sec : complexity ] we will then show that ( [ eq : sosmodel ] ) can be minimized in strictly polynomial time using the techniques introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use standard notation from graph theory , and refer the reader to @xcite for the definitions .",
    "let @xmath10 be a directed graph .",
    "the optimization problem we consider is @xmath11    using the definitions @xmath12 the objective - function can be written as @xmath13    we intend to reformulate the original optimization problem in terms of the variables @xmath14 .",
    "obviously we must demand @xmath15 for all edges @xmath16 . furthermore , since the @xmath14 describe potential - differences in the scalar field given by a set of height variables @xmath17 , it is clear that the sum of the @xmath14 along any oriented cycle on the surface has to be zero .",
    "the following theorem establishes this constraint formally in the special case , where @xmath18 is a planar graph .",
    "[ theo : cocircuit ] let @xmath10 be a planar , directed graph and @xmath19 be the associated dual graph .",
    "there exists a set of node - variables @xmath20 such that @xmath21 if and only if @xmath22 satisfies @xmath23    a proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite chapter 5 .",
    "given a vector @xmath22 and a node @xmath2 we call the number @xmath24 the excess of a node @xmath2 . a complete formulation , which , for planar graphs , is equivalent to ( [ eq : nodeobjective ] ) is thus given by @xmath25 a vector @xmath22 satisfying these equations",
    "is called a circulation @xcite .",
    "the problem is a convex network - flow problem in the dual graph without any capacity constraints ( the flow - variables @xmath14 on each edge can take on arbitrary positive or negative values ) .",
    "we note that this reduction , as well as the results in the following section , more generally hold for any objective function , which can be written as @xmath26 where the @xmath27 are convex functions with a minimum .",
    "the algorithms which solve the convex flow problem @xcite are not strictly polynomial if there are no capacity constraints .",
    "we will show in this section that in the special case of problem ( [ eq : sos ] ) the time complexity of the successive shortest path algorithm for convex flow can be bounded by a strict polynomial .",
    "for this purpose we start with a brief review of the algorithm , a more detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the underlying philosophy is to search the solution in a subset of @xmath28 , in which each vector @xmath22 yields a lower bound for the optimum of ( [ eq : sos ] ) but does not necessarily satisfy the flow - constraints ( [ eq : sosflow ] ) .",
    "the flow balance at all nodes has to be approached iteratively by the algorithm . to characterize this subset ,",
    "one introduces the notion of dual feasibility :    let @xmath29 be a sum of functions @xmath30 of the components @xmath14 of @xmath22 .",
    "a vector @xmath22 is called dual feasible , if there is a number @xmath31 for every node ( potential - function ) , such that for all edges @xmath16 the reduced cost inequalities @xmath32 are satisfied .",
    "let @xmath22 be a dual feasible vector and let @xmath33 be an optimal solution of problem ( [ eq : sos ] ) , then @xmath34 .",
    "the proof is given in @xcite chapter 9 and chapter 14.3 . an immediate consequence of this theorem is    a dual feasible vector @xmath22 satisfying ( [ eq : sosint ] ) , ( [ eq : sosflow ] ) is an optimal solution of problem ( [ eq : sos ] ) .    in order to apply the successive shortest path algorithm we determine a dual feasible initial solution .",
    "here we can choose the vector @xmath35 , whose components minimize the functions @xmath36 and the potential function @xmath37 .",
    "note that , when @xmath38 , the reduced costs ( [ eq : dualfeas ] ) simply measure the change of the objective function triggered by a change of the @xmath39component by plus resp .",
    "minus one .",
    "these are clearly all positive if @xmath22 minizes every summand of ( [ eq : sos ] ) .",
    "the initial solution does in general not satisfy the flow - equations ( [ eq : sosflow ] ) .",
    "the excess @xmath40 of all nodes is then balanced by iteratively augmenting @xmath22 along paths between supply - nodes ( @xmath41 ) and demand - nodes ( @xmath42 ) , which are shortest paths with respect to the reduced costs .",
    "the variables @xmath14 associated with the edges along such a path are changed by exactly one unit ( the sign depends on the orientation of the edge in the path ) .    due to the non - linearity of the objective",
    "every update of @xmath22 leads to a new set of arc - weights .",
    "however , the convexity of the individual functions @xmath27 ensures , that the inequalities ( [ eq : dualfeas ] ) still hold after every augmentation , when @xmath43 is replaced by @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the algorithm works correctly because it always maintains dual feasibility of @xmath22 with respect to the current set of arc - weights .",
    "wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww successive shortest path +   + @xmath46 + @xmath38 + there is a node @xmath47 with @xmath48 + compute the reduced costs @xmath49 + determine the shortest path distances @xmath50 from @xmath47 to all + other nodes with respect to the reduced costs + choose a node @xmath51 with @xmath52 + let @xmath53 denote the shortest path vector from @xmath47 to @xmath51 in @xmath18 + [ alg : xupdate ] @xmath54 + @xmath55 +   + * end * +    the complexity of the algorithm is @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 is the time needed for a shortest path search in a network with positive arc - weights and @xmath58 counts the number of paths needed to balance the excess of all nodes .",
    "the following lemma then yields an upper bound for the value of @xmath59 .",
    "the vector @xmath35 that minimizes @xmath60 ( eq .  [ eq : sos ] ) satisfies @xmath61 .    if the integrality- as well as the flow",
    " constraints are neglected the global minimum of @xmath62 is attained at @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "if we now take into account the integrality  constraints it follows from the convexity of the @xmath65 , that the minimum @xmath66 is attained in either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "we thus find @xmath69 from theorem [ theo : cocircuit ] we obtain @xmath70 and thus @xmath71",
    "we implemented the successive shortest path algorithm for the convex - flow problem . the program needs less than 80 seconds on a sparc workstation to solve instances of grid - graphs with @xmath72 nodes and randomly chosen offsets to optimality .",
    "grid - graphs of size @xmath73 nodes take about 10 - 15 minutes .",
    "we used c++ for our implementation and made use of the leda - class library @xcite .",
    "the physical results , which have been obtained with this program , together with their theoretical interpretation will be reported elsewhere @xcite ."
