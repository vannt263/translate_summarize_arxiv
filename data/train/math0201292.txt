    "obviously , @xmath4 is a complex algebraic orbifold ( in other words , a smooth stack ) of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "it is fibered over the moduli space @xmath7 of curves with the fiber over @xmath8\\in   \\mathcal{m}_g$ ] equal to the punctured vector space @xmath9 ( modulo the action of a finite group @xmath10 ) .",
    "orbifold @xmath4 is naturally stratified by the multiplicities of zeroes of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a sequence of positive integers , @xmath12 with the sum @xmath13 equal to @xmath14 .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the subspace of @xmath16 consisting of equivalence classes of pairs @xmath0 where @xmath2 has exactly @xmath17 zeroes and their multiplicities are equal to @xmath11 ( for some ordering of zeroes ) .",

    "one has then @xmath20 thus , we have a stratification of the moduli space @xmath4 .",
    "it is well - known that each stratum @xmath15 is an algebraic orbifold of dimension @xmath21 ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it carries a natural holomorphic affine structure . here is the description of this structure .    with any pair",

    "( for points @xmath26 with nontrivial symmetry we would need to pass first to a finite covering of the neighborhood of @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , we obtain ( locally ) a _ period mapping _ from @xmath15 to a domain in a complex vector space .",
    "it is well known that this mapping is holomorphic and locally one - to - one .",
    "the pullback of the tautological affine structure on @xmath27 gives an affine structure on @xmath15 .",
    "( see also  @xcite for a related construction concerning smooth closed 1-forms . )    in general , the strata @xmath15 are not fiber bundles over the moduli space of curves @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the dimension of the stratum @xmath28 for @xmath3 equals @xmath29 , while dimension of the moduli space of curves @xmath7 equals @xmath30 which is strictly larger than @xmath29 for @xmath31 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe the set of connected components of all strata @xmath15 .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the answer is quite complicated , some strata have up to 3 connected components .",
    "the full description of the connected components of strata is given in the section  [ ss : main ] .",
    "this result was announced in the paper  @xcite .",
    "[ rm : number ] for any _ sequence _ @xmath32 of positive integers @xmath33 such that @xmath34 we define @xmath35 the moduli space of abelian differentials on curves with _ numbered _ zeroes such that the first zero has multiplicity @xmath36 etc .",
    "orbifold @xmath35 is a finite covering of @xmath15 .",
    "one can show that preimage of any connected component of @xmath15 in @xmath35 is connected , i.e. the classification of connected components is essentially identical in both cases , no matter whether the zeroes are numbered or not .",
    "the motivation for our study came from dynamical systems , namely from the theory of so called interval exchange transformations .",
    "first of all , there is an alternative description of @xmath4 in terms of differential geometry . outside of zeroes of an abelian differential @xmath2",
    "one can chose locally a complex coordinate @xmath37 in such way that @xmath38 .",
    "this coordinate is defined up to a constant , @xmath39 , so it determines a natural flat metric @xmath40 on the riemann surface @xmath1 punctured at zeroes of @xmath2 . at zero of @xmath2 of multiplicity @xmath41 the metric has a conical singularity with the cone angle @xmath42 .",
    "this flat metric has trivial holonomy in the group @xmath43 : a parallel transport of a vector tangent to the riemann surface @xmath1 along any closed path avoiding conical singularities brings the vector back to itself .",
    "thus , choosing a tangent direction at any nonsingular point we can extend it using the parallel transport to all other nonsingular points , getting a smooth distribution on the punctured riemann surface .",
    "this distribution is integrable : it defines a foliation with singularities at the conical points .",
    "the oriented foliation defined by the positive real direction @xmath24 in coordinate @xmath44 is called _ horizontal _ ; the oriented foliation defined by the positive purely imaginary direction @xmath45 is called _",
    "vertical_. at a conical point with a cone angle @xmath42 one gets @xmath46 horizontal ( vertical ) directions .",
    "conversely , a flat structure with trivial @xmath43-holonomy having several cone type singularities plus a choice of , say , horizontal direction uniquely determines a complex structure on the surface , and an abelian differential in this complex structure .",
    "an abelian differential @xmath2 defines also two smooth closed real - valued 1-forms @xmath47 and @xmath48 on @xmath1 considered as a smooth oriented two - dimensional surface @xmath49 .",
    "the vertical and horizontal foliations described above are the kernel foliations of the 1-forms @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspondingly .",
    "conversely , let @xmath49 be a compact smooth oriented surface of genus @xmath5 with a pair of closed 1-forms @xmath52 such that @xmath53 everywhere on @xmath49 outside of a finite set .",
    "then there is a unique point @xmath54\\in { { \\mathcal{h}}}_g$ ] producing such @xmath49 with forms @xmath55 .",
    "there is a non - holomorphic continuous action on @xmath4 of the group @xmath56 ( the group of matrices with positive determinants ) . in terms of pairs of 1-forms @xmath57",
    "this action is given simply by linear transformations @xmath58    later in this text we shall use all descriptions of @xmath4 : the algebro - geometric one , the one in terms of flat surfaces with a choice of the horizontal direction , and the one in terms of pairs of measured oriented foliations .",
    "it was proved by h.  masur , see  @xcite and by w.  a.  veech ( see  @xcite ) that for a generic ( with respect to the lebesgue measure ) point of any stratum @xmath15 the horizontal foliation ( and also the vertical one ) is uniquely ergodic .",
    "let us take any interval @xmath59 on the surface @xmath49 transversal to the vertical foliation , with the canonical induced length element .",
    "the first return map @xmath60 ( defined almost everywhere on @xmath59 ) is an interval exchange map , i.e. a one - to - one map with finitely many discontinuity points such that the derivative of @xmath61 is equal almost everywhere to @xmath62 .",
    "the interval exchange map is parametrized by the number @xmath63 of maximal open subintervals @xmath64 of continuity of the transformation @xmath61 , by the sequence of lengths of these subintervals @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and by a permutation @xmath68 describing the order in which intervals @xmath69 are placed in @xmath59 : the @xmath70-th interval is sent to the place @xmath71 .",
    "it follows from the unique ergodicity that the permutation @xmath72 is _ irreducible _ , which means in our context that @xmath73 we have @xmath74 .",
    "conversely , for any interval exchange map @xmath61 one can construct an abelian differential @xmath2 and a horizontal interval @xmath59 on a complex curve @xmath1 such that the first return map to @xmath59 along the vertical foliation of @xmath2 is the given map @xmath61 , see  @xcite , @xcite . though the abelian differential @xmath2 is not uniquely determined by the interval exchange map , the collection of multiplicities of zeroes @xmath75 of @xmath2 and even the connected component of the moduli space @xmath15 containing point @xmath54 $ ] are uniquely determined by the permutation @xmath72 , see  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus one may decompose the set of irreducible permutations into groups called _ extended rauzy classes _ corresponding to connected components of the strata @xmath15 .",
    "the application of our result to the theory of interval exchange maps is based on the corollary of the fundamental theorem of h.masur  @xcite and w.veech  @xcite which we present in the next section .",
    "the corollary is as follows : dynamical properties of a generic interval exchange map depend only on the extended rauzy class of the permutation of subintervals .",
    "genericity is understood here with respect to the lebesgue measure on the space @xmath76 parameterizing lengths @xmath77 of subintervals under exchange .",
    "actually , the extended rauzy classes can be defined in purely combinatorial terms , see appendix  [ a : rauzy : cl ] for details .",
    "thus the problem of the description of the extended rauzy classes , and hence , of the description of connected components of the strata of abelian differentials , is purely combinatorial . however , it seems to be very hard to solve it directly .",
    "still , for small genera the problem is tractable .",
    "w.veech showed in  @xcite that the stratum @xmath78 has two connected components .",
    "p.arnoux proved that the stratum @xmath79 has three connected components .    in the present paper",
    "we give a classification of extended rauzy classes using not only combinatorics but also tools of algebraic geometry , topology and of dynamical systems .",
    "there is a natural immersion of the moduli space of abelian differentials into the moduli space of holomorphic quadratic differentials : we associate to an abelian differential its square . with every quadratic differential we can again associate a flat metric with conical singularities .",
    "the group @xmath80 acts naturally on this larger moduli space as well ; this action leaves the immersed moduli space of abelian differentials invariant , moreover , on the immersed subspace it coincides with the action defined in the previous section .",
    "this action preserves the natural stratification of the moduli space of quadratic differentials by multiplicities of zeroes .",
    "the action of the diagonal subgroup of @xmath81 on the moduli space of quadratic differentials can be naturally identified with the geodesic flow on the moduli space of curves for teichmller metric ( which is piecewise real - analytic finsler metric on @xmath7 ) .",
    "group @xmath82 preserves the hypersurface in the moduli space of quadratic differentials consisting of those ones for which the associated flat metric has the total area equal to @xmath83 .",
    "numerous important results in the theory of interval exchange maps , of measured foliations , of billiards in rational polygons , of dynamics on translation surfaces are based on the following fundamental observation by h.masur  @xcite and w.veech  @xcite :    the teichmller geodesic flow acts ergodically on every connected component of every stratum of the moduli space of quadratic differentials with total area equal to @xmath83 ; the corresponding invariant measure on the stratum is a finite lebesgue equivalent measure .",
    "thus our classification of connected components of the strata of abelian differentials gives the classification of ergodic components of the teichmller geodesic flow on the strata of squares of abelian differentials in the moduli space of quadratic differentials .",
    "the complete classification of connected components of strata of quadratic differentials is in progress ( see an announcement in  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the stratum of those quadratic differentials on a curve of genus @xmath84 , which can not be represented as a square of an abelian differential , and which have a single zero of degree @xmath85 , has two connected components , but at the moment a topological invariant which would distinguish representatives of these two connected components is not known yet .    in general , it seems to be very interesting to describe invariant submanifolds ( closures of orbits , invariant measures ) for the action of @xmath56 on the moduli spaces .",
    "connected components of the strata are only the simplest invariant submanifolds , there are many others . for example",
    "the teichmller disks of veech curves form the smallest possible invariant submanifolds .",
    "one can use a submanifold invariant under the action of @xmath56 to produce other invariant submanifolds in higher genera applying some fixed ramified covering construction to all pairs @xmath0 constituting the initial invariant submanifold . in section  [ ss :",
    "hyp : com ] we use a particular case of this construction to define some special connected components of some strata .",
    "first of all , we introduce the moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials .    for integer @xmath86 and collection @xmath87 such that @xmath88 for all @xmath89 and @xmath90 , denote by @xmath91 the moduli space of pairs @xmath92 where @xmath1 is a smooth compact complex curve of genus @xmath5 and @xmath93 is a meromorphic quadratic differential on @xmath1 with zeroes of orders @xmath94 ( simple poles if @xmath95 ) such that @xmath93 is not equal to the square of an abelian differential .    it is known ( see  @xcite ) that @xmath91 is a complex algebraic orbifold of dimension @xmath96 sometimes we shall use `` exponential '' notation to denote multiple zeroes ( simple poles ) of the same degree , for example @xmath97 .",
    "the condition that @xmath93 is not a square is automatically satisfied if at least one of parameters @xmath94 is odd .",
    "one can canonically associate with every meromorphic quadratic differential @xmath92 another connected curve @xmath98 with an abelian differential @xmath2 on it .",
    "namely , @xmath98 is the unique double covering of @xmath1 ( maybe ramified at singularities of @xmath93 ) , such that the pullback of @xmath93 is a square of an abelian differential @xmath2 .",
    "we have automatically @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the involution on @xmath98 interchanging points in the generic fiber over @xmath1 .",
    "curve @xmath98 is connected because of the condition that @xmath93 is not a square of an abelian differential .",
    "thus , we obtain a map from the stratum @xmath91 of meromorphic quadratic differentials to the stratum @xmath101 of abelian differentials , where numbers @xmath102 are obtained from @xmath103 by the following rule : to each even @xmath104 we associate a pair of zeroes of @xmath2 of orders @xmath105 in the list @xmath102 , to each odd @xmath104 we associate one zero of order @xmath106 , and associate nothing to simple poles ( e.g. to @xmath95 ) .",
    "[ lm : q : to : h ] the canonical map described above @xmath107 is an immersion .    denote as above by @xmath98 the double covering of @xmath1 with abelian differential @xmath2 and involution @xmath100 .",

    "thus , we obtain ( locally ) a mapping from @xmath91 to a domain in the complex vector space @xmath111 .",
    "it is well known that this mapping is holomorphic and locally one - to - one . since the space @xmath101 is locally identified with @xmath27 by means of the period mapping , this completes the proof of lemma .",
    "the following two series of maps of this kind would play a special role for us : @xmath112 where @xmath113 in both cases . in both cases curve @xmath1",
    "is rational ( i.e. @xmath114 ) , and hence curve @xmath98 is hyperelliptic of genus @xmath115 . in these two cases",
    "the dimension of the image stratum of abelian differentials coincides with the dimension of the original stratum of meromorphic quadratic differentials .",
    "indeed , formula   gives @xmath116 while formula   gives the following dimensions of the image strata : @xmath117    we have constructed a map @xmath118 using certain canonical double covering @xmath119 . choosing some other ( ramified ) covering of some fixed type one can construct some other ( local ) maps between moduli spaces of quadratic or abelian differentials .",
    "the reader can find a detailed description of all maps of this kind between moduli spaces of _ quadratic differentials _ , which give coincidence of dimensions , in paper  @xcite .    before returning to maps   which are of a particular interest for us we need to prove the following statement .",

    "the corresponding meromorphic quadratic differential exists and is unique up to a non - zero scalar .",
