    "the ic wavenumber @xmath21 is small ( @xmath53 ) at @xmath54 where the continuous degeneracy of the classical tafm ground state corresponds to a mere shift in the origin of the coordinate system ; the classical degeneracies remain for a transverse field @xmath55 , even if the spins are confined to the planes .    both the dm term ( inactive for the possible c state in transverse field ) and the much smaller anisotropy term@xcite ( responsible for the phase transition in longitudinal field@xcite ) favor spins in the @xmath11@xmath12 planes . for the ic state in transverse field , it is natural to assume that the dm term confines the spins to the planes at all fields ( as it does at small @xmath5 ) , and to ignore the @xmath56 term .",

    "the spins break out of the planes ( in the optimal solution ) ; this is surprising , for each intrachain term in the energy is optimized or neutral if the spins lie in the planes , and so is the sum of the interchain and field terms .",

    "the ic phase for @xmath76 is , however , very complicated : the solutions are far more numerous , they differ only slightly in energy for the most part , and the low  energy solutions are not the simplest ; ground  state energy crossings make it impossible to identify with confidence the optimal solution in most of this range . in short ,",

    "pointed out that such a term in the hamiltonian ( with @xmath137 ) may have the same consequences as quantum fluctuations .",
    "our treatment is phenomenological because a biquadratic coupling term is not allowed in the hamiltonian for cscucl@xmath0 ( because @xmath14 ) , and therefore the term appears here in a fundamentally different way than previously .    to test",
    "whether the phenomenological term describes qualitatively the effects of quantum fluctuations , we applied the formalism to the tafm , minimizing the total energy @xmath138\\eqno(13)\\ ] ] ( this is just @xmath139 ) for the five tafm states shown in figure 2 ; the direction of * h * is irrelevant and all states have the same classical energy .",
