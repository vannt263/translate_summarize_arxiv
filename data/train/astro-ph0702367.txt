    "the accreting matter is assumed to be streaming along the magnetic poles .",
    "the bulk motion velocity ( @xmath97 ) of this matter will be seen from different angles along the line of sight due to the rotation of the white dwarf .",
    "the apparent velocity of accreting matter at any orbital phase @xmath39 is given by @xmath98 , where , @xmath99 is the angle between the magnetic axis and line of sight , and is related to the inclination angle @xmath51 , magnetic obliquity @xmath100 and @xmath39 as @xmath101    assuming @xmath102 and @xmath100 = @xmath103 , the observed modulation in the velocity of line can be well explained by equation  [ eqn - polar ] with the emitting region moving at a velocity of @xmath104 km  s@xmath4 accreting on to a single pole .",
    "this velocity is close to the shock velocity of an accreting white dwarf of mass in the range of 0.60.7  @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we interpret the observed variation in the amplitude of line shifts with phase as due to the aspect effect according to equation  [ eqn - polar ] .",
    "similar phase dependent line velocity variation of few hundred km  s@xmath4 are reported in several fuv lines too . also , observations with low energy transmission grating onboard _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory showed that the emission line components are somewhat broader than the instrumental width , and the authors attribute this to the continuously changing angle between the accretion column and the observer .",
    "the apparent lack of any velocity shift in the fluorescent line is in accordance with the standard emission models where this line is believed to be due to reflection of the hard x - rays from the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the equivalent width of fe fluorescent line ( @xmath105 ev ) combined with an n@xmath106 smaller than 10@xmath107 @xmath18 also supports this idea .    in the above discussion",
    "we assume that the observed velocity shifts are real and not an artefact .",
    "this can be judged from figure  [ fig - felines ] that clearly shows the varying line center of fe xxvi and fe xxv .",
    "also the shifts in the line center values obtained from the overlapping phase bins ( figure  [ fig - vel_shift ] ) clearly show a sinusoidal trend modulated with the orbital period .",
    "the one artefact that might get introduced into our analysis is wrong identification of a particular line as the wavelength region around 1.6 - 2.0 @xmath11 is filled with many des and other lines . though the resolution of chandra heg data does not allow us to fully resolve individual he - like lines of fe , and wrong identification of a line is plausible , the effect of this is only to change the final velocity value but not the modulation .",
    "we have presented here an analysis of high resolution _",
    "chandra _ observations of a prototype polar am  her .",
    "the analysis of the average x - ray spectrum shows that it is well fitted by a multi - temperature , partially absorbed plasma emission apec models .",
    "a mass of 1.15@xmath100.05 m@xmath3 is derived based on the best fit of multi - temperature plasma model to the average x - ray spectrum of am  her .",
    "the multi - temperature nature of the plasma is further confirmed by analysis of individual emission lines .",
    "the plasma diagnostics based on line - ratios of helium - triplets and fe - l shell ions suggests a dense ( @xmath108 @xmath31 ) plasma .",
    "the helium - like triplets of o and ne give a temperature of @xmath1092  mk , whereas the ratio of hydrogen - like line to helium - like line of fe suggests a temperature of 12  kev .",
    "we have constructed the dem distribution of a am  her , which is the first time that such an exercise has been carried out for a polar .",
    "the constructed dem distribution using individual line fluxes shows that the dem is continuous with a possible minimum near @xmath110 .    from the phase",
    "resolved spectroscopy , we have found a possible evidence for bulk motion of the ionized material in the accretion column of am  her .",
    "the velocity of line is modulated as a function of the orbital phase consistent with a single pole accretion .",
    "the ions from the hottest plasma show a maximum velocity shift of @xmath91100 km  s@xmath4 , that is close to the shock velocity expected for a @xmath90.6  m@xmath3 white dwarf .",
    "the velocity shifts are observed to be much smaller for , and the hydrogen - like lines of and .",
    "the variation in the velocity shifts of different ions is used to calculate the height of the accretion column from the white dwarf surface from where the line emission originates .",
    "an mass of @xmath91.0  m@xmath3 for the mass of the white dwarf is indicated by using the heights of and line emitting regions estimated by the observed velocities of these lines .",
    "the multi - temperature mass estimate hence , gives an upper limit for the mass of the white dwarf owing to the bias introduced by using single temperature flow in the accretion column .",
    "the density and temperature structure in the accretion column are also derived .",
    "no velocity shift is seen in the fluorescent fe line , consistent with its origin due to reflection from the white dwarf surface .",
    "higher resolution observations are required to detect the radial velocity modulation in this line .",
