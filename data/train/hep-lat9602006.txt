    "the study of three - dimensional field theories has attracted a lot of attention over the past few years . while some models are investigated for field theoretic reasons or because they are more easily accessible than their four - dimensional homologues , others have an immediate physical meaning in the context of four - dimensional field theory at finite temperature .",
    "it has been known for a long time that for temperatures much higher than any mass scale of a given theory its non - static matsubara modes may be integrated out perturbatively to yield a three - dimensional effective theory for the zero modes @xcite .",
    "this effective theory describes the static long - range physics of the underlying four - dimensional finite - temperature theory , and moreover contains all the infrared divergences and non - perturbative phenomena that spoil a purely perturbative treatment of the latter .",
    "in particular , the three - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model represents an effective high - temperature theory for the standard electroweak model , after neglecting the u(1 ) sector and fermions in a first approximation .",
    "since it was realised that the baryon asymmetry of the universe could have been generated during a first - order electroweak phase transition @xcite , a lot of effort has been spent to determine the order and dynamics of this transition in detail .",
    "the perturbative procedure of dimensionally reducing the four - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model at finite temperature to a three - dimensional effective theory has been carried out in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding relations between the three - dimensional and four - dimensional parameters and temperature may be found there . bearing these relations in mind , we shall stay entirely within the framework of the 2 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) higgs model in this paper .",
    "there are already several analytical @xcite-@xcite and numerical @xcite-@xcite studies of the three - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model .",
    "while the main motivation for these studies was the phase transition itself , there also emerged the problem of understanding the structure of the symmetric phase . due to infrared divergences in vector loops ,",
    "straightforward perturbation theory breaks down in the symmetric phase , and until recently not much was known about the particle spectrum and the effective interactions in this parameter region of the theory . in a recent analytic calculation ,",
    "the loop expansion was reorganised by resumming masses and vertices , which led to a set of gauge independent gap equations for the vector boson and the higgs masses , defined on their respective mass shells .",
    "the solutions of these equations predict a non - vanishing vector boson mass and scalar vacuum expectation value in the  symmetric phase \" , which thus would be interpreted as another higgs phase , just with different parameters . on the other hand , lattice simulations in four dimensions at finite temperature @xcite as well as in three dimensions",
    "@xcite have reported vector boson masses about four times larger than predicted by the gap equations .",
    "the picture conjectured from the lattice results is one of a symmetric phase with confining behaviour ( in the sense of qcd ) and a particle spectrum consisting of bound states .",
    "similar conclusions may be drawn from analytic investigations of truncated renormalisation group equations which indicate strong coupling effects in the symmetric phase @xcite .",
    "the picture of a qcd - like symmetric electroweak phase has also been employed for a model calculation of bound state masses @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation of the large discrepancy between the two approaches is a breakdown of the resummed loop expansion of @xcite in higher orders . in principle , however , it is also conceivable that an extremely low - lying state might not have been visible on the lattice sizes that have been investigated .",
    "moreover , all simulations have emphasised the difficulty of measuring correlation functions in the symmetric phase due to the extremely low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to shed more light on the situation in the symmetric phase by employing new techniques which allow a more reliable lattice calculation of the mass spectrum .",
    "the masses are extracted from correlation functions of gauge invariant operators . in order to improve the sensitivity to low - lying or bound states we construct a large set of non - local operators by employing a  blocking \" technique similar to the one which has proved to be useful in pure gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this procedure turns out to be very effective in enhancing the projection of our operators onto the lowest states .",
    "moreover , it reduces the statistical errors significantly , yielding more accurate results for the masses .",
    "we also measure cross correlations between different operators .",
    "diagonalisation of the corresponding correlation matrix then unmixes the superposition of the ground state and the excited states .",
    "this procedure further improves the signal for the lowest states and , more importantly , enables us to estimate the masses of the first few excited states .",
    "it also allows us to extract information about the overlap any individual operator has with a given state , and hence the coupling between the different states .",
    "we then perform a study of finite - size effects and an extrapolation to the continuum limit for two points in parameter space , one located in the symmetric and one in the higgs phase .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section[sec : action ] the lattice action and the basic operators used in mass calculations are discussed .",
    "the details and more technical aspects of our simulation are described in section[sec : simulation ] . in section[sec : results ] we present our results , analysing in detail the reliability of our mass estimates of the ground state , and including the extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "finally , section[sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the action of the su(2 ) higgs model in 2 + 1 dimensions and its general properties in the continuum and on the lattice have been discussed previously in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in order to fix the notation and to give all equations used in this paper we list some of these general aspects here .",
    "the continuum action is given by [ l3d ] s = d^3x , where all fields are in a @xmath3 matrix notation , = 12 ( + i ) , d_= ( _ - i g_3 w _ ) , w _ = 12  .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath4 and the scalar coupling @xmath5 have mass dimension 1/2 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the action ( [ l3d ] ) can be parametrised by two dimensionless parameters , which may be chosen to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 . fixing these parameters",
    "determines the physical properties of the theory .",
    "the corresponding lattice action may be defined as [ actlat ] s[u,]&=&_g_p(1-u_p ) + _",
    "x\\{-_h_=1 ^ 3 ( ^(x)u_(x ) ( x+ ) ) + & & + ( ^(x)(x ) ) + _ r^2 } .    due to the super - renormalisability of the theory ( [ l3d ] )",
    ", the only parameter receiving ultraviolet renormalisation is the scalar mass parameter @xmath7 , whose corrections have been determined at the two - loop level @xcite in perturbation theory using the @xmath8 scheme .",
    "the corresponding two - loop calculation in lattice perturbation theory was carried out in @xcite .",
    "requiring that the renormalised mass parameters be the same in both regularisation schemes , a relation between the parameters labelling the continuum and lattice theories has been established @xcite , [ lcp1 ] _ g&= & , + _ r&= & , + & = & ( -3 - ) + ( 1 + 4 ) + & & + , [ lcp3 ] with the numerical constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    a monte carlo simulation of any quantity in the theory ( [ actlat ] ) is carried out for a given set of bare parameters @xmath11 . in order to establish contact with the desired continuum physics one first has to perform an infinite volume limit , i.e. , do simulations on lattices much larger than the largest correlation length of the theory such that the results do not show any dependence on the lattice size .",
    "secondly , one has to perform a continuum limit @xmath12 , i.e. , to simulate at different values of @xmath13 and extrapolate to @xmath14 .",
    "this limit has to be taken in such a way that the renormalised quantities parametrizing the theory remain constant .",
    "the corresponding ` lines of constant physics ' in the space of the lattice parameters are given by equations ( [ lcp1])-([lcp3 ] ) .",
    "the actions ( [ l3d ] ) and ( [ actlat ] ) have an @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "physical states are described by gauge invariant operators .",
    "after decomposing @xmath16 as ( x)=(x)(x ) , ^2(x)=(^(x)(x)),(x)0,(x ) su(2 ) , one may define the gauge - invariant composite field v_(x)=^(x)u_(x)(x+ ) .",
    "while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are invariant under local transformations , they transform under the diagonal global @xmath19 subgroup , customarily termed weak isospin , as (x)=(x),v_(x)=v_(x)^-1 , su(2)_diag , i.e. , the lowest excitation of @xmath17 describes the isoscalar higgs boson while the matrix - valued @xmath20 transforms as an isovector . a single field representing the spin - one",
    ", isospin - one @xmath21 boson may be obtained from the composite link variable by taking the trace with an insertion of a pauli matrix @xmath22 .",
    "taking the trace without @xmath22-insertion produces another spin zero isoscalar operator .",
    "a third @xmath1 isoscalar operator is given by the plaquette .",
    "thus we consider the following set of basic operators for the description of the low - lying states , [ ops ] 0^++:r(x ) & & ( ^(x)(x ) ) , + 0^++:l(x ) & & _ = 1 ^ 2 ( ^(x)u_(x)(x+ ) ) , + 0^++:p(x ) & & u_1(x)u_2(x+)u^_1(x+ ) u^_2(x ) , + 1^:v_^a(x ) & & ( ^a^(x)u_(x)(x+ ) ) .",
    "the plaquette @xmath23 is particularly interesting because it consists of gauge degrees of freedom only , and in the three - dimensional pure gauge theory it is the simplest operator one can use to describe the @xmath1 glueball @xcite . in the theory with scalars one expects a mixing of this operator with the other @xmath1 operators due to the coupling of gauge and scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "the phase structure of the three - dimensional model with lattice action ( [ actlat ] ) has not been fully mapped out by numerical simulations as yet . however , from analyticity considerations @xcite and numerical studies of the four - dimensional model @xcite one expects the following qualitative picture : the three - dimensional parameter space spanned by @xmath11 is divided into higgs and confinement - like ( or symmetric ) regions by a surface of first - order phase transitions which is crossed by changing @xmath24 for fixed @xmath25 . at sufficiently large values of @xmath26 and small values of @xmath13 this surface",
    "is expected to terminate so that the two regions are analytically connected . in this region , there is no phase transition but just a crossover as @xmath24 is varied .",
    "numerically , however , this region in the phase diagram has so far not been accessed in the three - dimensional theory .",
    "the continuum limit is represented by a single point in the phase diagram , @xmath27 . in order to describe different continuum theories , the continuum limit has to be taken along different paths in the parameter space , as specified by equations ( [ lcp1])-([lcp3 ] ) .",
    "the term confinement - like is chosen to distinguish the behaviour of the theory in this region of parameter space from the confinement realised in the three - dimensional pure gauge theory . there",
    "the potential between static charges rises linearly with distance , without any bound . in the higgs model one",
    "expects a flattening of the potential at some large distance , due to pair creation of scalars breaking the string between the static charges , just as fermions break the string in qcd . from the analytic connectedness of the higgs and the confinement regions it follows that for every state in the higgs region , there is a corresponding one in the confinement region . in particular , the same operators ( [ ops ] ) may be used to describe physical states in both regimes .",
    "the global isospin symmetry is realised in the higgs as well in the confinement region , so one expects low - lying states with the same quantum numbers in both regions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is a closer investigation of the mass spectrum in the confinement - like phase , by calculating correlations of operators of the type in eq.([ops ] ) .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the details of our calculation , including the simulation algorithm , the construction of  blocked \" or  smeared \" operators for the higgs and vector bosons and the way in which these are used to compute matrix correlators .",
    "we conclude this section with details about the statistical analysis and the fitting procedure employed to obtain our final mass estimates .",
    "our monte carlo simulation is performed using the lattice action in eq.([actlat ] ) , containing the bare parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    for the update of the gauge variables we use a combination of the standard heatbath and over - relaxation algorithms for su(2 ) @xcite .",
    "the scalar degrees of freedom are updated using the algorithm proposed in @xcite , which uses the four real components of the scalar field @xmath16 .",
    "thus , no separate updates of the radial and angular parts @xmath17,@xmath30 are required , leading to a simple implementation of the algorithm . as explained in @xcite , over - relaxation ( reflection )",
    "steps in the update of the scalar field can be easily incorporated , provided the higgs self - coupling @xmath29 is not too large , which would lead to a poor acceptance rate . in our simulation , where @xmath31 , we achieved acceptance rates of well over 90% .",
    "higher values of @xmath29 could be simulated , for instance , by using the reflection algorithm described in @xcite .    in our simulation ,",
    "a  compound \" sweep consists of a combination of heatbath ( hb ) and several reflection ( ref ) updates of the gauge and scalar fields , 1hb\\{u } + 1hb\\ { } + n_or\\ { ref\\{u } + n_ref ref\\ { } } . in accordance with ref.@xcite , we chose @xmath32 to be roughly equal to the inverse scalar mass in order to achieve maximum decorrelation . with this choice we found that the average integrated autocorrelation time estimated using the scalar mass was close to one , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "our simulations were performed for inverse gauge couplings @xmath33 and  12 .",
    "we restricted our attention to one point in the symmetric and one point in the higgs region of parameter space chosen sufficiently away from the phase transition , so that the system does not tunnel between the phases . in order to compare our results directly with those of a previous calculation of the lightest scalar and vector masses @xcite",
    ", we work at the same fixed value of @xmath6 , [ eq : ratio ] = = 0.0239 , which in the context of the four - dimensional theory corresponds to a higgs mass at tree - level and zero temperature of @xmath34 .    in the symmetric phase of the model we initially chose @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 was then fixed by the relations ( [ lcp1])-([lcp3 ] ) .",
    "the same relations determine the continuum scalar mass parameter in the @xmath8 scheme as @xmath37 .",
    "our point in the higgs phase of the model was fixed to be @xmath38 , which corresponds to @xmath39 in the continuum . at @xmath40 and  9 the corresponding values of @xmath41 and @xmath29 were chosen according to the  lines of constant physics \" , eqs.([lcp1])([lcp3 ] ) , using the constraint eq.([eq : ratio ] ) .    at @xmath35 , monte",
    "carlo runs were performed on lattice sizes ranging from @xmath42 up to @xmath43 in order to analyse finite - size effects in detail .",
    "this is of special importance in the symmetric phase of the model , where we are particularly interested in the possible occurence of very light states .    for all our observables ,",
    "statistics were gathered from about 30000 compound sweeps . in a few cases ,",
    "statistics were increased to a total of 75000 sweeps .",
    "the main difficulty encountered in recent attempts to compute the mass spectrum in the symmetric phase of the su(2 ) higgs model @xcite , was the low signal - to - noise ratio in the computation of the correlation function c(t ) _ * x*,*x* e^i*p*(*x*-*x* ) ^(*x*,t)(*x*,0)_c & = & _ n>0|0|(0)|n|^2 e^-ae_nt + & & _",

    ".    one important goal of our simulations is to investigate the possible existence of very low - lying states in the symmetric phase of the model , such as predicted by the analytic approach in @xcite .",
    "if an operator has a bad projection onto the lightest state one must be able to follow the signal to sufficiently large @xmath47 before the ground state dominates @xmath48 .",
    "a poor signal - to - noise ratio of the correlation function will then hamper any effort to establish the existence of such a state .",
    "the problem is further exacerbated in the symmetric phase , where , due to the confining behaviour of the theory , the particle spectrum may consist of bound states , having a larger spatial extension than their point - like counterparts in the higgs region .",
    "previous experience with calculations of the glueball spectrum in pure gauge theory shows that conventional local operators have indeed a bad projection onto bound states in confining theories @xcite .",
    "the situation could be considerably improved by constructing  blocked \" or  smeared \" , non - local operators @xcite , which are of similar extended structure as the bound states they are supposed to project on .",
    "similar techniques , which preserve gauge invariance , have been developed and successfully applied in simulations of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "here we are applying and extending these ideas in order to construct non - local versions of the operators defined in eq.([ops ] ) .",
    "some of these techniques were applied to the four - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model in ref.@xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we construct composite (  blocked \" ) link variables @xmath49 of blocking level @xmath50 according to [ lbl ] u_^(n)(x)&=&u_^(n-1)(x)u_^(n-1)(x+ ) + & & + _ = 1,^2",
    "u^(n-1)_(x)u_^(n-1)(x+ ) u_^(n-1)(x++)u_^(n-1)(x+2 ) .",
    "the links @xmath49 are twice as long as those at the lower blocking level @xmath51",
    ". we shall refer to this as  link blocking \" in the following .",
    "it seems natural to design a similar procedure for the scalar fields @xmath16 .",
    "site - blocked \" scalar field @xmath52 at blocking level @xmath50 can be constructed iteratively from a field at a given lattice site and its covariant connection with the four nearest neighbours , [ sbl ] ^(n)(x)=^(n-1)(x)+_=1 ^ 2 .",
    "clearly both blocking procedures can be iterated , thereby quickly increasing the number of links and sites contributing to a given composite variable .",
    "non - local blocked operators are now constructed from the basic ones ( [ ops ] ) by replacing the scalar and link variables with composite ones at a desired blocking level .",
    "note that the blocking steps are constructed in a way which preserves the gauge invariance of the original operators .",
    "the basic operators @xmath53 and @xmath23 contain only site and link variables , respectively . by applying the corresponding blocking procedure to these operators",
    ", we get @xmath54 operators of different spatial extension , where @xmath54 denotes the maximal blocking level .",
    "these we write as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . for the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 both site and link blocking can be applied , so from each of them we construct a set of @xmath60 operators , denoted by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where the first upper index stands for site and the second for link blocking .      the blocking procedure described in the previous subsection is designed to yield an optimal operator for a given set of quantum numbers . in an attempt to further separate the excitations from the ground state we can also utilise the information contained in our non - optimal operators by considering cross correlations between different operators in the same channel .",
    "for a given set of quantum numbers we construct a set of , say , @xmath54 lattice operators , @xmath64 , with those quantum numbers .",
    "we normalise these operators so that @xmath65 , and we impose the same normalisation on all the operators we discuss below . to find the energy of the lightest state we use a variational criterion .",
    "that is to say , we find the linear combination of the @xmath66 that maximises [ c1 ] ^(a ) ( 0 ) = ^^-ha .",
    "call this operator @xmath67 . in the limit where the basis @xmath68 is complete",
    ", this procedure becomes exact .",
    "that is to say , if the lightest state is @xmath69 and the corresponding energy is @xmath70 , then _ 1 vac = 1 , and [ c2 ] e^-ae_1 = ^(a ) _",
    "we can find higher excited states by a simple extension of this procedure .",
    "let the first excitation be @xmath71 and let the corresponding energy be @xmath72 .",
    "we consider the subspace @xmath73 of @xmath74 that is orthogonal to @xmath67 , i.e. , such that @xmath75 .",
    "we apply the same variational criterion as above , but restricted to this subspace .",
    "this gives us an operator @xmath76 . in the limit where our original basis becomes complete",
    ", we have _ 2 vac = 2 , and ^-ae_2 = ^(a ) _",
    ". we can continue this procedure obtaining operators @xmath77 from which we can obtain the energies of higher excited states .    in our case",
    "our basis is finite , and we can obtain at most @xmath54 operators @xmath78 .",
    "with such a limited basis eq.([c2 ] ) provides at best an estimate for @xmath79 .",
    "we improve upon this estimate by calculating the correlation function @xmath80 for all @xmath47 . if we define an effective energy by ^-ae_eff(t)t = ^(t ) _",
    "1(0 ) , then we know that @xmath81 will approach @xmath70 from above as @xmath47 increases . the more effective our variational procedure , the smaller the value of @xmath47 at which this occurs ( for a basis that is complete we would find @xmath82 for all @xmath47 ) .",
    "so we can estimate @xmath79 from the value of @xmath83 on its ` plateau ' .",
    "in practice , what we actually do is to fit the correlation function to an exponential in @xmath47 for @xmath47 large enough ( as described below ) . from the exponent",
    "we then obtain our estimate for @xmath79 . from the coefficient of the exponential we obtain the normalised projection of our operator onto the lightest state ,",
    "i.e. @xmath84 . if we have a good basis of operators then this projection will be close to one . in practice",
    "this is always the case in the scalar channel , where the projection is often consistent with unity . in the vector channel",
    "the projection tends to be @xmath85 .",
    "we follow the same procedure for excited states , extracting @xmath86 by fitting an exponential to @xmath87 for large enough @xmath47",
    ". one must be more careful here than with the ground state because , with a finite basis , the operator @xmath88 will have some projection onto all states , not just onto @xmath89 .",
    "so as @xmath90 its correlation function will ultimately vary as @xmath91 and not as @xmath92 .",
    "thus , by fitting an exponential at larger @xmath47 we may underestimate the value of @xmath86 . in practice",
    "this is not a problem where the operators are very good .",
    "for example if the projection of @xmath67 onto the lightest state is @xmath93 , then the projection of @xmath76 onto this lightest state is @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 is as small as it is in our calculations , then this potential contamination of @xmath72 by @xmath70 is insignificant .",
    "the same argument can be used for higher excited states . in general , where we quote a mass without qualifications , we are confident , by examining the relevant projections , that our mass estimate is not significantly contaminated by admixtures of any of the lighter states that we list .    in practice",
    "our lattice is finite and so in the above we replace @xmath96 by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the length of the lattice in the @xmath47-direction .",
    "the procedure we follow to obtain the @xmath88 is standard @xcite .",

    "for example we could apply it to @xmath103 rather than to @xmath104 . as a check",
    "we have performed such an alternative calculation .",
    "we further remark that , in practice , the best of our original @xmath66 operators is already so good that the calculation of the ground state in each channel is not greatly improved by going to the @xmath88 operators .",

    "it has been known for some time that correlated fits may amplify hidden systematic errors in the data @xcite .",
    "therefore we repeated all our fits using an uncorrelated covariance matrix .",
    "the difference between the results obtained using either correlated or uncorrelated fits are quoted as a ( symmetric ) systematic error on our mass estimates . in most cases",

    "for the final extrapolation of masses and mass ratios to the continuum limit , statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature before the extrapolation is performed .",

    "is gained by blocking the @xmath53 operator , while in the confinement phase four iterations are necessary before it reaches its optimal projection . for the plaquette @xmath23 , three blocking steps are required to get to the minimal effective mass in either phase , but the improvement is far more pronounced in the confinement phase .",

    "while they are dominated by noise in the higgs phase , they suggest a separate plateau in the effective mass plot in the confinement phase . up to those time separations for which we have a good signal , there seems to be no tendency for this operator to mix with the other @xmath1 operators .",
    "we shall return to this observation below .",
    "finally , figure  [ blo5_6 ] shows the result of the blocking procedure on the effective masses of the vector boson . in the higgs phase",
    "blocking slightly improves the projection of the operator @xmath59 , but it is not difficult to extract a mass also from the unblocked one . in the confinement",
    "phase the situation is rather different .",
    "the unblocked operator does not give any signal beyond noise , and the figure displays how even for the best blocked candidates excitations die out only very slowly .",
    "in particular , the figure illustrates how one might easily extract too large a mass for the vector boson , if one only used a non - optimal operator such as the one symbolised by the triangles .",
    "the effective masses produced by the different operators do not seem to merge at a common ground state up to the distances to which we can follow the signal . an indication that we do really see the ground state is the fact that further iterations in the blocking procedures for either links or scalars , beyond the level of the operator @xmath120 , again result in a worse projection .",
    "figure  [ blo5_6 ] also displays a nice side effect of the blocking procedure .",
    "since the improved operators have a better projection onto low mass states the corresponding correlation functions fall less steeply than those of the unblocked ones , hence the signal - to - noise ratio is improved , leading to considerably smaller statistical errors .    in summary",
    ", we find that blocking has little or no effect in the higgs phase , where the original local operators exhibit a rather good projection onto the ground state in each channel . in the confinement phase , on the contrary",
    ", blocking turns out to be necessary in order to obtain any useful signal at all .",
    "this is particularly pronounced in the @xmath107 channel .",
    "it was also demonstrated by using a large set of operators , that in the confinement phase for time separations up to ten timeslices one is typically still rather far away from the asymptotic region where all excited states have died out .",
    "this implies that the latter are rather light compared to the ones in the higgs phase , as we shall see more explicitly in the next subsections .",
    "this is precisely what spoils an easy mass measurement in the confinement phase .",
    "we have increased blocking levels on each kind of operator until we could explicitly identify the ones with the best projection onto the lowest states .",
    "thus we can be sure that we have found the optimal operators that can be constructed from ( [ ops ] ) by means of the blocking technique described in subsection[sec : imp ] .",
    "now we discuss the correlations of the eigenstates of the matrix correlators @xmath121 introduced in subsection[sec : cross ] .",
    "consider first the @xmath107 channel .",
    "employing a basis composed of the three operators used in figure  [ blo5_6 ] we obtain , after diagonalisation , the three sets of effective @xmath21 masses shown in figure  [ cross1_2 ] for the higgs and confinement phases . comparing with figure  [ blo5_6 ] , we conclude that this procedure has only slightly improved the projection onto the ground state . however , it has clearly separated off the excitations . even though it is not always possible",
    "to identify extended plateaux for these excited states , one can nevertheless conclude from the comparison between higgs and confinement phases that the gap between the ground state and the excitations is much larger in the former .",
    "clearly , in order to obtain more quantitative information about the excitations , one would need to choose a larger basis of operators .",
    "we shall not pursue this possibility here , since in this channel our main interest is in the ground state .",
    "next , consider the three lowest states in the @xmath1 channel shown in figure  [ cross3_4 ] . in the higgs region ,",
    "the situation is rather simple with an isolated higgs ground state and a large gap to excitations .",
    "because the excited states are much higher in mass , their correlation functions fall rapidly , one loses the signal after a few timeslices , and it is difficult to identify well - defined excited states . here one would also need to increase the basis of operators and to reduce the lattice spacing , in order to improve the situation .",
    "in contrast , in the confinement phase the diagonalisation has isolated three distinct states which were mixed previously . in table",
    "[ coeff ] the coefficients @xmath122 ( cf .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) ) with which the individual operators contribute to various eigenstates are shown .",
    "the labelling is such that @xmath67 denotes our best operator for the ground state , @xmath76 the one for the first excited state , etc .",
    "._coefficients @xmath122 as defined in eq.([eigen ] ) of the operators used in the simulation for the three lowest @xmath1 states in the confinement phase ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath123 ) . in the header",
    ", we also introduce the labelling for scalar states used below.[coeff ] _ [ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]",
    "we have presented results for the mass spectrum of the continuum su(2 ) higgs model in three dimensions at selected points in the symmetric and broken phases of the model . in order to get reliable mass estimates , the use of improved lattice operators turned out to be crucial .",
    "this is of particular importance for the investigation of the possibility of very low - lying states of the kind predicted by the analytic approach presented in @xcite .    using our particular blocking procedure",
    ", we were able to increase the projection onto the ground state dramatically .",
    "in most cases in the scalar channel , we achieved projections of essentially 100% , whereas in the vector channel values for the overlap ranged between 7595% . undoubtedly , with a more refined smearing or blocking procedure , one could improve the signal for the ground state in the @xmath107 channel even further .",
    "we wish to emphasise the importance of a high projection onto the desired state , since otherwise the possible misidentification of plateaux in the effectice masses is a source of large systematic errors which are difficult to quantify . due to our use of the blocking procedure ,",
    "we observe quantitative differences in the masses of the lightest scalar and vector states on specific lattices in the symmetric phase compared to ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe strong finite - size effects in the ground state of the @xmath1 channel in the symmetric phase .    within the framework of our calculation",
    "we find no evidence for very small masses in the scalar and vector channels in the symmetric phase , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out , however , that we considered correlations of gauge - invariant composite operators , whereas the correlators of elementary fields used in the analytic approach in @xcite are gauge - dependent .",
    "there are indications from the numerical work reported in @xcite that correlations of these gauge - dependent operators indeed exhibit a signal corresponding to a very low effective mass of the gauge boson .",
    "this needs to be better understood .",
    "our computation of masses of excited states confirms the existence of a dense spectrum of states in the confinement phase of the model .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the picture that bound states constitute the particle content of the symmetric phase .",
    "a surprising result of our calculation is the existence of states that are composed almost entirely out of gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this  @xmath21-ball \" and its excitations are almost identical in mass to their gluonic counterparts in the pure su(2 ) gauge theory . we are thus led to conclude that the pure gauge sector in the su(2 ) higgs model approximately decouples from the scalar degrees of freedom , a phenomenon which must be of dynamical origin .",
    "we have shown in this paper that by using various refined calculational tools in lattice simulations of the su(2 ) higgs model , detailed information of the mass spectrum in the symmetric phase can be gained .",
    "this is important for the development of effective theories of the symmetric phase , which will serve to analyse the nature of the phase transition at very large higgs masses @xcite , and to describe the thermodynamics of the electroweak plasma in the high temperature symmetric phase in the early universe .",
