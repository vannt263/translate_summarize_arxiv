    "simulations of lattice qcd using staggered fermions  @xcite are able , at present , to reach significantly smaller dynamical quark masses than those using other fermion discretizations  @xcite .",
    "this computational advantage is due in part to the axial @xmath4 symmetry remaining at nonzero lattice spacing , which protects the quark mass from additive renormalization .",
    "the primary disadvantage of staggered fermions is that each continuum flavor comes in four tastes . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the tastes become degenerate and one can formally remove the extra tastes by taking the fourth - root of the quark determinant ( the `` @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick '' ) . at non - zero lattice spacing , however , the @xmath6 taste symmetry is broken by discretization errors of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing .",
    "these errors are numerically significant in present simulations  @xcite .",
    "this has two related implications .",
    "first , since one must , in practice , take the fourth - root of the determinant before taking the continuum limit , the resulting underlying quark action is likely non - local .",
    "it is thus not guaranteed to lie in the same universality class as qcd , even if the non - local part is , in some sense , of @xmath7 and thus small.{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick see refs .  @xcite . ]",
    "second , assuming that the continuum limit is correct , it is necessary to perform a combined continuum and chiral extrapolation taking into account taste - breaking effects of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the first issue is clearly more fundamental , but also more difficult to address . to date , support for the use of the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick comes from an accumulation of numerical or indirect evidence : the accurate agreement of lattice and experimental results for all `` gold - plated '' quantities that have been calculated  @xcite ; the success of fits of the light pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants to the predictions of chiral perturbation theory including the @xmath7 taste - breaking errors  @xcite ; the near four - fold degeneracy of eigenvalues of the staggered dirac operator and its ability to correctly measure the topology of the gauge configurations  @xcite ; and the results of analytic studies of the time continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "none of these tests purports to be conclusive . nevertheless , in the absence of a more theoretical approach , it is important to have further numerical tests .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the present work .    our major focus , however , is on the further development of chiral perturbation theory for staggered fermions including discretization errors .",
    "staggered chiral perturbation theory \" ( or s@xmath9pt for short ) is the theoretical tool which determines the functional forms needed to do the combined continuum and chiral extrapolations incorporating taste violations .",
    "the development of s@xmath9pt for staggered fermions _ without _ the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick , i.e. with four tastes per flavor , is a standard application of the methods of effective field theory  @xcite . in order to apply s@xmath9pt to simulations done with the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick , however , one must alter the @xmath9pt feynman rules by hand ( or alternatively use a variant of the replica trick  @xcite ) , so there is no underlying  staggered chiral lagrangian \" which can reproduce the feynman rules  @xcite . nevertheless , if the resulting expressions describe the outcomes of numerical simulations done using the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick , one gains confidence that the long distance physics of the staggered simulations reproduces that of qcd in the continuum limit . indeed ,",
    "the expressions in s@xmath9pt go over to those of standard qcd @xmath9pt in the continuum limit , and give an explicit example of how the effect of the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick can vanish smoothly .",
    "we consider here only s@xmath9pt applied to the properties of pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgbs ) .",
    "s@xmath9pt is a combined expansion in powers of the quark masses and lattice spacing , in which the usual power counting is @xmath10 .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) correction to continuum @xmath9pt is the @xmath7 potential , which was determined for a single flavor of staggered fermion in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this potential retains an @xmath3 subgroup of the continuum @xmath6 taste symmetry .",
    "since this subgroup is larger than the discrete lattice symmetry group , the masses of the pgbs in certain lattice irreps are predicted , at lo , to be degenerate .",
    "reference  @xcite generalized the potential to multiple staggered flavors , and showed that the degeneracies remain .",
    "these predictions of s@xmath9pt work very well ; both in old quenched results  @xcite and in recent dynamical simulations ( using the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick )  @xcite .",
    "this success gives one confidence in the utility of s@xmath9pt .",
    "it is well known from continuum @xmath9pt that practical applications to the properties of the physical pgb mesons requires one to work at least to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the same is true of chiral extrapolations of lattice data  @xcite .",
    "thus for s@xmath9pt to be a practical tool for guiding extrapolations , it must be extended beyond lo .",
    "important first steps were taken in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , where the one - loop contributions to the mass and decay constant of the lattice goldstone boson ( that with taste @xmath11 ) were calculated .",
    "these forms , and in particular the taste - breaking built into them , have proved essential to describe the numerical results  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the success of the fits provides more evidence for the applicability of s@xmath9pt , and the lack of problems introduced by the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick .    in this paper",
    "we continue the extension of s@xmath9pt to nlo by determining all the operators proportional to @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , including source terms for left- and right - handed currents and for scalar and pseudoscalar densities .",
    "these operators give the analytic nlo contributions that incorporate the effects of discretization .",
    "each is multiplied by a different , unknown low energy coefficient ( lec ) .",
    "the full nlo result is obtained by adding their contributions to those from one - loop diagrams and from the continuum nlo operators .    in continuum @xmath9pt",
    "there are of order ten nlo operators , and it is possible to consider enough physical quantities to determine their coefficients and make predictions . in s@xmath9pt",
    "we find that there are an order of magnitude more nlo operators .",
    "while , in principle , there is a corresponding increase in the number of physical quantities that can be calculated ( e.g. scattering amplitudes with many choices of external tastes ) , in practice it will be difficult to carry through a nlo program along the lines of that in the continuum .    nevertheless , our enumeration of operators is not a purely academic exercise , for there is one set of quantities for which very few operators contribute , and a number of new predictions can be made .",
    "these are quantities which are non - vanishing only because the @xmath3 taste symmetry is broken .",
    "since this symmetry is preserved by the lo lagrangian , it is also preserved by the one - loop contributions , as these involve lo vertices .",
    "thus the only source of @xmath3 breaking is the nlo operators .",
    "furthermore , we find that for pion masses and pseudoscalar decay constants ( i.e. the vacuum to pion matrix element of the pseudoscalar density ) , the only contribution to @xmath3 breaking comes from the operators proportional to @xmath12 , and that there are few enough of these that we can make several predictions . these are valid only at nlo , being violated by higher order terms .",
    "comparison of these s@xmath9pt predictions with lattice data numerically tests the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick .",
    "discussions of staggered fermions can quickly become rather technical , so in an attempt to keep the main text of this paper accessible , we relegate most of the details of operator enumeration to an appendix . the precise organization is as follows . in sections [ sec : review ] and",
    "[ sec : schpt ] we review the construction of the continuum quark - level effective staggered action and leading order staggered chiral perturbation theory , respectively . in section  [ sec : newops ] we discuss the symmetry - breaking pattern exhibited by the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 operators , and outline the general consequences for various pgb properties .",
    "our specific predictions for relations between @xmath3 breaking in masses , dispersion relations and pseudoscalar decay constants are presented and explained in section [ sec : decay ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we determine the nlo staggered operators in appendix  [ app : ops ] , and collect them in the tables of appendix  [ app : tables ] .",
    "the construction of the chiral lagrangian including discretization errors proceeds in two steps  @xcite .",
    "one first determines the continuum effective lagrangian for quarks with momenta much smaller than the lattice cut - off @xmath15 .",
    "the dominant power - law dependence on the lattice spacing is thereby made explicit . in the second step one",
    "maps the continuum quark - level lagrangian onto an effective chiral lagrangian . in this section",
    "we briefly review the first step for staggered fermions , including in the effective lagrangian the leading discretization effects , which are proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "this lagrangian was determined for a single flavor in ref .",
    "@xcite , and generalized to multiple flavors in ref .",
    "while we obtain no new results here , we attempt to clarify aspects of the discussion in these papers .",
    "the construction of the effective quark lagrangian follows the standard method developed by symanzik  @xcite , in which one determines all local continuum operators of dimension up to and including six that are invariant under the lattice symmetry group .",
    "given the complexity of the symmetry group for staggered fermions  @xcite , a simple way to perform this enumeration is to first write down allowed _",
    "operators of dimension up to six , and then match them onto continuum operators .",
    "the first step utilizes all of the lattice symmetries , including translations .",
    "it is discussed in detail in appendix a of ref .",
    "the second step uses only transformations that map the @xmath17 hypercube onto itself , which are related to spin and taste transformations in the continuum  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , there are no dimension 5 operators  @xcite . at dimension 6",
    "one finds purely gluonic operators , fermion bilinears and four - fermion operators .",
    "these operators were enumerated in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "neither the gluonic operators nor the fermion bilinears break the continuum taste symmetry because they do not contain any taste matrices .",
    "since our major focus is taste symmetry breaking , we do not reproduce these operators here .",
    "they do , however , break the continuum @xmath3 rotation symmetry down to its hypercubic subgroup , @xmath18 , and we discuss this issue briefly in appendix  [ app : ops ] .",
    "@xmath6 taste symmetry is broken by the four - fermion operators .",
    "we first recall the results for a single flavor and then generalize to multiple flavors .",
    "we write quark bilinears using the direct - product ( spin @xmath19 taste ) notation of refs .",
    "are euclidean gamma matrices , while the taste matrices , @xmath20 , are complex - conjugated euclidean gamma matrices . ]",
    "each four fermion operator in the effective lagrangian turns out to be a product of two bilinears with the same spin and taste .",
    "thus one can use a compact notation to represent them .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite we write the pair of spin matrices in the two bilinears as @xmath21 using the definitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the pair of taste matrices are denoted in the same manner with @xmath24 . the four fermion operator is then denoted by the spin and taste matrices that it contains .",
    "for example @xmath25 \\equiv \\sum_{\\mu}\\sum_{\\nu<\\rho } \\bar{q } \\sfno{\\mu5}{\\nu\\rho } q \\,\\bar{q } \\sfno{5\\mu}{\\rho\\nu } q \\ , , \\label{eq : at}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are dirac fields with spinor and taste indices .",
    "we stress that @xmath26 are at this stage continuum fields , and that the two @xmath27 s and two @xmath28 s in this operator reside at the same position in euclidean space .",
    "the fields @xmath26 also have color indices , which can be contracted in ( [ eq : at ] ) either within each bilinear or between them .",
    "these two color contractions are related by fierz transformations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these transformations were used to select a basis in which all operators had the same type of color contraction . here",
    "we proceed differently , following ref .",
    "we keep both color contractions , and use the notation such as @xmath29 $ ] to implicitly refer to both .",
    "this is a sensible notation because , when we map these operators into the chiral lagrangian , the choice of color contraction is irrelevant : the two operators map onto the same chiral operators .",
    "using this notation allows us to shorten the list of operators , since by fierz transformations we can always bring the operators into a form in which both bilinears have `` odd distance '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explanation of this terminology ) .",
    "for example , the operator @xmath30 - [ p\\times p]\\}$ ] , which consists of two bilinears both of distance zero , can be transformed into a linear combination of operators with odd - distance bilinears .",
    "we now list the resulting four - fermion operators .",
    "they can be divided into two types based on how badly they break taste symmetry .",
    "twelve have their spin and taste indices contracted separately , as in the example of ( [ eq : at ] ) , and are therefore rotationally - invariant : @xmath31 + [ s\\times v ] + [ a\\times s ] + [ v\\times s ] + [ p\\times v ] + [ p\\times a ] + [ v\\times p ] + [ a\\times p ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\ ; [ t\\times v ] + [ t\\times a ] + [ v\\times t ] + [ a\\times t ]   % + \\left\\{[s\\times s]-[p\\times p]\\right\\ } + % \\left\\{[s\\times p]-[p\\times s]\\right\\ } + \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\left\\{[s\\times t]-[p\\times t]\\right\\ } + % \\left\\{[t\\times s]-[t\\times p]\\right\\ } +   % \\left\\{[v\\times v]-[a\\times a]\\right\\ } +   % \\left\\{[v\\times a]-[a\\times v]\\right\\ }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : l6ffa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each operator has a unique coefficient , which we do not show , that is proportional to @xmath16 , but also depends on @xmath32 and ln(@xmath8 ) . because the indices on the taste matrices are contracted between bilinears , these operators preserve an @xmath3 subgroup of the full @xmath6 taste symmetry .",
    "the four remaining four fermion operators have spin and taste indices contracted together : @xmath33 + [ t_\\mu\\times a_\\mu ] + [ v_\\mu\\times t_\\mu ] + \\,[a_\\mu\\times t_\\mu ]   % + \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\left\\{([v_\\mu\\times v_\\mu]-[a_\\mu\\times a_\\mu ] ) -\\frac{1}{4 } % ( [ v\\times v]-[a\\times a])\\right\\ } + \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\left\\{([v_\\mu\\times a_\\mu]-[a_\\mu\\times v_\\mu ] ) -\\frac{1}{4 } % ( [ v\\times a]-[a\\times v])\\right\\ }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : l6ffb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ the precise meaning of this notation can be seen from the example in ( [ eq : vtdef ] ) . ]",
    "they are therefore only invariant under certain combined spin and taste rotations , and break the full spin - taste symmetry down to the discrete subgroup respected by the lattice theory , @xmath34  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "these `` ff(b ) ''",
    "operators break the continuum symmetry maximally .",
    "one advantage of this basis is that the @xmath35 symmetry of the lattice theory ( which is exact in the chiral limit ) is manifest . under this symmetry",
    "@xmath36)\\ , q\\,,\\quad \\bar{q } \\longrightarrow \\bar{q}\\ , \\exp(i\\alpha[\\gamma_5\\otimes \\xi_5 ] ) \\ , , \\label{eq : u1}\\ ] ] and each of the operators in ( [ eq : l6ffa ] ) and ( [ eq : l6ffb ] ) is separately invariant .",
    "another advantage is that there are fewer operators to consider ; ref .",
    "@xcite had an additional six @xmath37 and two @xmath38 operators .",
    "thus far we have only considered the single flavor theory .",
    "we now recall the generalization to @xmath39 flavors  @xcite .",
    "the quark field picks up a flavor index , @xmath40 , and bilinear operators generalize straightforwardly , e.g. @xmath41 .",
    "the generalization of the four - fermion operators is more subtle .",
    "since these operators are the result of hard gluon exchange , and gluons do not change flavor , they can be written in a form containing flavor diagonal bilinears , i.e. @xmath42 of course we could fierz transform such an operator to bring it into a `` flavor - mixed '' form , but it is advantageous not to do so .",
    "this is because , in the unmixed basis ( [ eq : ffunmixed ] ) , each bilinear must have odd distance in order to be invariant under the lattice axial symmetry , as discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "thus the spin - taste structure of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 four - fermion operators remains as in ( [ eq : l6ffa ] ) and ( [ eq : l6ffb ] ) , respectively , but the flavor structure is now given by ( [ eq : ffunmixed ] ) .",
    "as for the single flavor case , there are two possible color contractions of each operator , but we do not show these explicitly as they play no role when we map the operators into the chiral lagrangian .    we emphasize that the result that only odd - distance bilinears appear in the flavor unmixed basis follows from symmetries alone . the discussion of gluon exchanges is given only to provide motivation for considering the flavor unmixed basis , but is not strictly necessary .",
    "since the four - fermion operators remain in the chiral limit , they must be invariant under the symmetries of the lattice theory in that limit .",
    "these include @xmath43 axial transformations , which act as in ( [ eq : u1 ] ) , except that @xmath44 is now an hermitian @xmath45 flavor matrix , and @xmath27 a flavor vector .",
    ", but this is not important for our considerations .",
    "] in the lattice theory , this corresponds to rotating even and odd sites by opposite @xmath43 transformations .",
    "it is easy to check that the operators in ( [ eq : l6ffa ] ) and ( [ eq : l6ffb ] ) are invariant under @xmath43 transformations if they are composed of flavor diagonal bilinears . on the other hand ,",
    "compound operators with spin - taste structure such as @xmath46 - [ p\\times p]$ ] are not invariant for more than one flavor .",
    "we stress that it is not sufficient to consider only @xmath47 transformations ( in which each flavor is rotated independently ) , since this does not rule out compound operators of the form @xmath48   \\,.\\ ] ] these are only ruled out by their lack of invariance under general @xmath43 transformations .    finally , we comment briefly on operators of yet higher dimension .",
    "since we aim to determine operators in s@xmath9pt proportional to @xmath14 , one might have thought that we need to enumerate all dimension 8 operators in the continuum effective theory ( dimension 7 operators are forbidden by the axial symmetry ) .",
    "fortunately this is not the case .",
    "the naive argument for this is that the dimension 6 operators break the continuum symmetries down to the lattice subgroup , and so dimension 8 operators break no further symmetries .",
    "since it is the symmetries that are used to map to the chiral lagrangian , the dimension 8 operators are not needed .",
    "this argument is , however , incomplete .",
    "what matters in addition is the number of taste matrices with correlated indices in the quark - level operators .",
    "if there are more such taste matrices , then one can build different operators in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "we explain this point in appendix  [ app : ops ] , where in section  [ app : singleffb ] we show that certain operators in the chiral lagrangian do not arise until @xmath49 , since they require four tensor taste matrices with fully correlated indices , and this does not occur unless one has an eight - quark operator .",
    "now , the dimension 6 operators have at most two taste matrices , as exemplified by @xmath29 $ ] in ( [ eq : at ] ) . moving to dimension 8",
    "adds further derivatives or gluon fields , but no further bilinears , and thus no more taste matrices . for this reason we do not need to enumerate the dimension 8 operators .",
    "in this section we review the mapping of the continuum quark effective lagrangian into the effective chiral lagrangian , working at leading order in our joint our expansion about the chiral and continuum limits .",

    "@xcite , the double trace operators of @xmath91 give rise to a previously unnoticed effect , namely the presence of hairpin diagrams ( quark disconnected contractions ) for flavor singlet mesons with non - trivial taste . in the lo potential , these occur only for vector and axial tastes , but , as we show below , at nlo they arise for all tastes .    given the importance of the axial @xmath43 transformations in restricting the form of the underlying quark operators , as explained in the previous section , it is worthwhile discussing these transformations at the mesonic level .",

    "matrices it is easy to show that @xmath94 it then follows immediately that all the operators in the potential @xmath76 are invariant under these transformations .",
    "we conclude by generalizing the results to partially quenched ( pq ) theories , since partial quenching is often used in practical simulations . following ref .",

    "note that the unquenched sea - quark sector lies within the pq theory , so one loses no generality by considering the larger theory  @xcite .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the form of the chiral lagrangian in the pq theory is unchanged , except that the chiral symmetry group becomes @xmath99 , traces are replaced by supertraces , and the pgb matrix is enlarged .",
    "for example , in a theory with two valence quarks ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) and three sea quarks ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , the pgb and mass matrices become ( schematically ) @xmath105 where each block is a @xmath106 taste matrix .",

    "in fact , for the sake of brevity we drop the superscript @xmath108 in the remaining sections .",

    "note that the relations are trivial when @xmath178 .",
    "the fact that the precise form of the mass used in the denominator on the r.h.s . does not matter at this order allows these expressions to be written in terms of quantitities that are directly measurable on the lattice .",
    "note that neither the taste singlet nor the taste goldstone pgbs receive rotational symmetry violating contributions to their dispersion relations at this order .",
    "such terms are prohibited by the fact that these tastes transform trivially under rotations .",
    "therefore they can only feel the effect of rotational symmetry breaking through operators with four or more derivatives  @xcite , @xmath179 which are of @xmath180 and thus contribute only at nnlo .",
    "next we turn to the relations involving the decay constants , still considering only flavor non - singlet mesons .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the @xmath3 breaking operators of @xmath138 contribute to both the masses and the decay constants . for the pseudoscalar decay constants , as for the masses , the contribution is through wavefunction renormalization .",
    "since the same terms contribute to both masses and decay constants , there are three simple relationships between splittings : @xmath181 these are likely to be the most simple predictions to test in practice .",
    "it is essential for these expressions that the @xmath182-factors are @xmath3-invariant , and therefore identical for both tastes in the expression .",
    "they can thus be tested using _",
    "bare lattice operators _ , thereby avoiding @xmath7 ambiguities in matching lattice and continuum operators that could destroy the relationship .",
    "this is not true in general ( e.g. for @xmath118 ) but does hold for the pseudoscalar operators @xmath183 .",
    "for example , the operators with spin - taste structure @xmath184 are related to @xmath185 by a lattice rotation .",
    "this argument shows why there can be no similar relationships involving the axial decay constants , since the @xmath182-factors in that case are not @xmath3 invariant .",
    "for example , @xmath186 is a  2 link \" operator while @xmath187 is a  4 link \" operator , so they are clearly not related by any lattice symmetries , and thus have different @xmath182 s .",
    "in fact , it is not even clear how to unambiguously calculate the quantities on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : relations ] ) for @xmath188 , as the @xmath182-factors are not universal at @xmath7 .",

    " @xmath16 source \" mesonic operators , which contribute @xmath3 breaking contributions to @xmath118 alone .",
    "the only prediction for axial decay constants is a qualitative one : the splittings between @xmath3 irreps should not be different in magnitude from those within the irreps .",
    "in other words , there should be no pattern of approximate degeneracies , unlike for the masses which exhibit approximate @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath118 was calculated for all tastes in the quenched approximation .",
    "we now turn to @xmath3-breaking predictions for pgbs for which the double supertrace , or `` hairpin '' , operators also contribute .",
    "these are particles which have a flavor singlet component , i.e. @xmath189 and @xmath190 in the unquenched sector , and @xmath191 or @xmath192 ( and their ghost companions ) in the valence sector .",
    "these states are mixed by hairpin contributions , and because , in general , they start off before mixing with different masses ( due to the different masses of the quarks ) , there are no simple predictions for the properties of the resulting mixed states .",
    "the situation is yet more complicated if the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick is being used . in fact , for the vector and axial tastes these complications arise at lo , due to the presence of hairpins , and have been addressed in detail in ref .",

    "the only theories for which the flavor non - singlet predictions still hold as written are unquenched theories with @xmath193 _ degenerate _ flavors . in these theories there",
    "is a single flavor - singlet state , and thus no mixing .",
    "this state can have any taste except @xmath64 , which is , as noted above , not a pgb .",
    "the predictions for the other fifteen tastes take exactly the same form as those given above for the flavor non - singlets , except that there are additional contributions to the @xmath194 s from the double supertrace operators : @xmath195 thus the @xmath3 breaking splittings for the flavor singlets are not related to those of the non - singlets , but the form of the predictions for dispersion relations , ( [ eq : prediction1 ] ) , and of the relations between mass and decay constant splittings , ( [ eqn : relations ] ) , remain unchanged .",
    "the situation is similar if one has @xmath196 degenerate flavors and uses the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick .",

    "these have the flavor structure @xmath199 , where 1 and 2 refer to valence flavors ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ,  ) .",
    "this picks out the desired hairpin contractions at the _ quark level_. to cancel the lo decay constants , and to obtain a quantity with a simple dependence on euclidean time , we take the ratio of the disconnected correlator to the connected ( @xmath200 ) correlator .",
    "this ratio has been studied extensively in the quenched approximation . in the present context , it has the attractive property that the derived relationships hold even if one uses the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to degenerate valence quarks , i.e. @xmath201 .    the earlier flavor nonsinglet predictions related splittings within @xmath3 irreps in masses and pseudoscalar decay constants . as a natural generalization to flavor singlets",

    "note that , in the denominator , any choice of tensor taste can be used , as the difference between the correlators for timeslice irreps @xmath203 and @xmath204 is subleading .",
    "we describe the calculation of ( [ eqn : so4_pp_t ] ) in detail , as the remaining predictions in this section all rely on some generalization of this method . at nlo ,",
    "the numerator is due to one diagram , shown in figure  [ fig : corrvertex ] , in which two lo insertions of the flavor singlet pseudoscalar density are contracted with a nlo hairpin vertex .",
    "= 1.9 in    while the full nlo tensor taste hairpin vertex comes from both @xmath0 and @xmath1 operators , only two operators , @xmath205 and @xmath206 in ( [ eqn : decay_ops ] ) , produce @xmath3-breaking .",

    "this is because the hairpin correlators do not , at this order , access the sea sector of the theory .",
    "the only caveat is that one must ensure that the mass of the tensor taste valence mesons differs significantly from that of any of the tensor taste mesons composed of sea quarks .",
    "if not , mixing of valence and sea sectors , although of higher than nlo , can be enhanced by the proximity to intermediate poles .",
    "another feature of the flavor - singlet prediction common with those earlier is that one can use the bare lattice pseudoscalar densities , since @xmath182 factors cancel in the ratio .",
    "one might be concerned that the @xmath182 factors in the numerator and denominator might differ , since the calculation of the former involves additional quark disconnected diagrams with intermediate gluons .",
    "one can show , however , that the difference between the @xmath182 factors vanishes in the continuum limit .",
    "this is actually true irrespective of the spin of the bilinear and follows because the operator has non - trivial taste .",
    "thus the difference between @xmath182 s in the numerator and denominator is of @xmath221 , and does not contribute at nlo .",
    "we have not been able to find a prediction as simple as ( [ eq : hairpinp ] ) for the vector or axial taste pgbs .",
    "the analogous @xmath3 breaking quantity to consider for , say , vector taste is : @xmath222 using the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite one can determine the form of this ratio .",
    "the calculation is complicated by the presence of the lo hairpin vertex , which means that there are not only terms proportional to @xmath223 , but also terms proportional to the non - singlet @xmath3 breaking quantity @xmath224 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the lo hairpins must be iterated to all orders brings in the sea sector through intermediate propagators , and the momentum dependence is quite complicated .",
    "thus we do not give explicit expressions .",
    "finally , we discuss the fourth point of our summary in the previous section .",
    "we can relate the hairpin contributions to @xmath119 and @xmath118 for pseudoscalar and tensor taste because they only arise from operators of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , there are no two supertrace @xmath2 operators , which would contribute to @xmath119 , or @xmath225 operators , which would only modify @xmath118 ; all nlo hairpin operators contribute to either both or neither quantity .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to calculate the contribution of these operators to @xmath119 and @xmath118 , and , when we do , we find a simple relation for both tastes : @xmath226 the contributions of the nlo two supertrace operators are equal and opposite .",
    "the minus sign comes from the fact that the @xmath0 terms contribute to @xmath119 only through wavefunction renormalization , but to @xmath118 also through the axial sources contained in the covariant derivative .",
    "note that these relationships do involve both @xmath3 conserving and breaking nlo contributions  in this sense they are more general than those considered above .",
    "these expressions can only be evaluated as written in unquenched theories with degenerate quarks .",
    "one needs to determine the decay constants of flavor singlet and non - singlet pgbs , and take the difference  this is @xmath227 . for non - degenerate sea quarks and/or pq theories , however , this will not work .",
    "as above , one can instead isolate the hairpin contributions using disconnected valence correlation functions .",
    "we consider the following ratios of pseudoscalar densities and axial currents : @xmath228 the superscript on the axial currents indicates the lorentz index , and not taste .",
    "again we assume equal valence quark masses , @xmath229 , and that the valence pgbs have masses differing from those of all pgbs composed of sea quarks . in both these ratios",
    "bare operators can be used as @xmath182 factors cancel as above .",
    "first consider taste @xmath11 . in this case @xmath1",
    "hairpin vertices are prohibited because of the lattice axial symmetry , so that the numerators of the ratios only involve two operators : @xmath230   \\right\\}\\ ] ] the contribution to the pseudoscalar ratio can be worked out as above . only the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : corrvertex ] contributes to the numerator , and one finds at nlo @xmath231 in fact , without even relating this to the @xmath232 ratio , we have another prediction of s@xmath9pt : the constant and @xmath233 terms should have opposite signs .    for the axial current correlator , the numerator receives contributions not only from wave function renormalization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrvertex ] ) , but also through direct renormalization of the axial current ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrsource ] ) .",
    "= 2.1 in    the flavor - disconnected axial correlator for taste @xmath11 is : @xmath234 where the first term is from wavefunction renormalization , and the second is from axial current renormalization .",
    "if we set @xmath212 , this can be simplified to : @xmath235 thus , in the axial correlator , the fact that only @xmath0 operators contribute for taste @xmath11 results in _ the absence of a single pole term_. to test this in practice one fourier transforms and takes the ratio to the connected correlator : @xmath236 the absence of a single pole translates into the predicted @xmath237 dependence .",
    "now we can return to the relation between hairpin contributions to @xmath119 and @xmath118 .",
    "this shows up in the fact that the overall coefficients in the @xmath210 and @xmath232 ratios are the same .",
    "the prediction in ( [ eq : deltafhairpin ] ) becomes the result that the constant terms have opposite signs . on the other hand",
    ", the linear terms must have the same sign as they correpond to a mass shift which does not depend on the external operators .",
    "one way to test the prediction of opposite constant terms is to add the two ratios : @xmath238 the s@xmath9pt prediction at nlo is then that there is no constant term in this quantity .",
    "because the tensor taste pgb is not a lattice goldstone pion , it has @xmath1 hairpin vertices in addition to those of @xmath0 .",
    "because of this , neither of the predictions ( [ eq : pp5ratio ] ) or ( [ eq : aa5ratio ] ) apply  the constant and linear terms in @xmath239 within each individual ratio are not related .",
    "since the @xmath1 hairpins lead only to mass renormalization , one expects , however , for the constant terms in the @xmath240 and @xmath232 ratios to be opposite , as for taste @xmath11 .",
    "this turns out to be the case .",
    "thus we find @xmath241 the absence of a constant term in this quantity is really two independent predictions , one for taste @xmath242 and another for @xmath203 .",
    "since the predictions ( [ eq : pp5ratio ] ) , ( [ eq : aa5ratio ] ) and ( [ eqn:5_predict ] ) do not require @xmath3 breaking , there can be and in fact are one - loop contributions to these ratios involving lo vertices .",
    "note that , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , quark disconnected correlators receive contributions at one - loop from single supertrace vertices . we have evaluated this contributions , and find that they are consistent with all three predictions .",
    "thus these are full nlo predictions of s@xmath9pt .",
    "staggered fermion simulations are currently able to reach much lower dynamical quark masses than other fermion discretizations .",
    "however , taste - symmetry breaking is numerically significant at current lattice spacings .",
    "thus combined chiral and continuum extrapolations incorporating discretization errors are crucial for correct extrapolation of physical quantities",
    ". moreover , the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick , which must be in practice be used before taking the continuum limit , may or may not change the universality class of the theory . thus it is unclear whether one is actually studying qcd .",
    "we have addressed both of these issues in this paper .    by enumerating all of the nlo operators in the staggered chiral lagrangian , including source terms , we allow a full nlo calculation , including analytic terms , of pgb properties . because @xmath3-taste symmetry breaking first enters at this order",
    ", these operators correctly reflect the true symmetry group of the underlying lattice action .",
    "they are therefore necessary , combined with one - loop contributions , for accurate extrapolations and precise determinations of physical quantities .    as we noted in the introduction",
    ", the large number of operators that appear at nlo implies that one must calculate a correspondingly large number of physical quantities in order to obtain predictions .",
    "thus , for most new quantities one calculates ( e.g. the decay constants of pgbs of different tastes ) , the nlo analytic terms simply give to an independent contribution proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "the most important nlo terms are then the one - loop contributions , which lead to non - analytic dependence on the quark mass and lattice spacing .",
    "the exceptions to this observation are quantities which are only non - vanishing because of @xmath3 breaking .",
    "these only recieve contributions from the nlo operators we have enumerated , and , in fact , from only a handful of these .",
    "there are no loop contributions at nlo .",
    "this allows us to make a number of testable predictions relating @xmath3-breaking splitting in pgb masses , decay constants , and dispersion relations .",
    "these predictions can be tested by calculating only two - point correlators of unrenormalized lattice operators . for the hairpin operators we suggest a method similar to that used successfully in quenched simulations .",
    "thus we hope that it will be practical to carry out these tests .",
    "we also find a few predictions for quantities that do not involve @xmath3 breaking , but reflect the structure of s@xmath9pt .",
    "these are nlo analogues of the absence of the taste tensor hairpin at lo .",
    "we stress that these predictions , like those above , are _ not _ consequences of lattice symmetries , and indeed are violated at nnlo or higher order in the chiral - continuum expansion . in a similar vein , we note that not all operators in the effective chiral theory which are consistent with the lattice symmetries and power counting actually appear at a given order .",
    "one must enumerate quark - level operators and then match these onto mesonic operators , and this leads , at nlo , to restrictions on the contraction of indices .    in our view , the most important application of the predictions we have given is to test the applicability of the effective chiral theory when one uses the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick , and by so doing to test the assumption that this trick does not modify the continuum limit .",
    "most of our predictions are unchanged in form when one implements the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick by hand in the effective theory .",
    "this is both good and bad .",
    "it is good because it makes the predictions somewhat more theoretically robust ; it is bad because one would like to calculate quantities which directly check the factors of @xmath197 put in by hand . in any case",
    ", the key point is that if s@xmath9pt fails to describe results from numerical simulations with small quark masses , this would shed serious doubt on the correctness of the @xmath5{\\mbox{det}}$ ] trick .",
    "testing our predictions will thus provide further empirical evidence either for or against the validity of this trick .",
    "we thank oliver br and claude bernard for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us department of energy through grant de - fg02 - 96er40956 .",
    "thanks the theory group at fermilab for hospitality while some of this work was undertaken .",
    "here we determine all operators in staggered chiral perturbation theory which are nlo in our power counting and arise from discretization errors .",
    "we do not discuss the remaining nlo operators , which are of @xmath244 , since they are unchanged from continuum chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we first discuss the chiral operators of @xmath245 .",
    "these arise from a single insertion of the quark - level @xmath246 operators .",
    "then we turn to the @xmath247 chiral operators , which require either two insertions of quark - level @xmath246 operators , or a single insertion of an @xmath247 operator .",
    "we close this subsection with a brief note on operators which do not arise until higher than nlo in our expansion .",
    "finally , we consider the @xmath0 operators involving covariant derivatives acting on taste spurions , which lead to additional contributions to the vector and axial currents .",
    "most of the dimension six gluonic operators and fermion bilinears do not break continuum symmetries , and can only generate corrections proportional to terms in the continuum chiral lagrangian .",
    "thus at nlo they only give rise to the two operators in the lo chiral lagrangian , @xmath248 multiplied by independent coefficients of size @xmath16 . in other words",
    ", they generate independent @xmath7 corrections to the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath78 .",
    "as we will see , many additional contributions to the two operators in ( [ eq : lotimesasq ] ) arise from the four - fermion operators discussed in the following sections .",
    "however , these , too , can simply be absorbed into the unknown coefficients multiplying each operator .",
    "here we use mass spurions which transform in the same manner as the @xmath67 field under a chiral symmetry transformation : @xmath249 these spurions also function as sources for the scalar and pseudoscalar densities , with @xmath250 , and @xmath104 and @xmath251 general hermitian fields . in the absence of external fields we set @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "the remaining two gluonic and bilinear operators violate euclidean rotation symmetry , @xmath254 although they are taste symmetric .",
    "they can give rise to rotationally non - invariant mesonic operators , but this requires four derivatives  @xcite , e.g. @xmath255 these operators are of @xmath256 , and thus nnlo , which is one higher order than we consider here .",
    "it is important to remember that the four fermion operators in @xmath113 are invariant under rotations and @xmath3 taste transformations , so they must map onto mesonic operators that also respect these symmetries . for discussion purposes , we divide them according to how they transform under @xmath257 chiral rotations .      here",
    "we consider mesonic operators arising from single insertions of four - fermion operators of the form @xmath260 $ ] and @xmath261 $ ] , where @xmath262 indicates the taste of the bilinears .",
    "the chiral structure of these operators is @xmath263 where and the upper and lower signs correspond to spins v and a , respectively , and @xmath264 are hermitian taste matrices . to determine the corresponding mesonic operators , we promote the taste matrices to spurion fields , with transformations chosen so that @xmath265 is invariant under chiral transformations : @xmath266 at the end we will set @xmath267 , where @xmath162 is the specific taste matrix appearing in the operator .    we first construct the resulting @xmath0 operators .",
    "these must be chiral singlets , respect parity ( @xmath268 and @xmath269 ) , be quadratic in @xmath162 ( odd powers of @xmath162 are forbidden by the @xmath270 symmetry and quartic terms are higher order in @xmath8 ) , and contain two derivatives .",
    "@xmath113 is rotationally invariant , so the indices of the derivatives must be contracted with each other , and can not be correlated with any of the indices associated with the taste matrices .",
    "it is easiest to construct linearly - independent , chiral singlet operators using elements with the same chiral transformation properties .",
    "we use left - handed building blocks , the choices for which are : @xmath271    we can now use the graded group theory method of ref .  @xcite to determine the number of linearly independent @xmath138 operators in a general @xmath272 partially quenched theory . because all of the operators in ( [ eqn : basis1 ] ) transform as bifundamentals under the left - handed chiral group they all potentially have both adjoint and singlet components .",

    "the mapping then proceeds as follows : first , determine the mapping of @xmath405 onto mesonic operators , for fixed @xmath78 ; next , set the taste spurions to their appropriate values ; and , finally , sum over @xmath78 and any other remaining indices .    the group theory required to determine the independent mappings of @xmath406 onto mesonic operators is identical to that for @xmath403 $ ] , since the spurions @xmath407 must transform like @xmath264 .",
    "thus one obtains the types enumerated in tables  [ tab : vddffp ] and [ tab : vddff ] , with the provisos that @xmath408 and that we must be careful with lorentz ( or , more precisely , hypercubic group ) indices .",
    "in particular , we do not yet know how the indices @xmath78 in the operators in the tables are connected with the index @xmath78 in @xmath405 . to work this out we need to determine how @xmath405 transforms under rotations _ while keeping the spurions",
    "fixed_. this may seem confusing because of the index @xmath78 in @xmath407 , but once , for a given @xmath78 , we convert the taste matrices into spurion fields , they are to be treated as rotationally - invariant ( pseudo-)scalar fields . then , since @xmath405 has two vector indices , it has a component which is a singlet under hypercubic rotations ( corresponding to summing over @xmath78 ) , and a component which is part of a 3-d hypercubic irrep ( the diagonal part of the two - index symmetric tensor representation of the euclidean rotation group ) .",
    "the former is not of interest here , since the sum over @xmath78 decouples the spin and taste indices .",

    "the singlet component has decoupled spin and taste indices , however , so we can drop it if we wish , and keep only `` @xmath409 '' .",
    "doing so gives the following simple prescription : keep the operators in tables  [ tab : vddffp ] and [ tab : vddff ] as is , but substitute @xmath408 . in this way",
    "the spin and taste indices become correlated . now that the operator mapping is done for fixed @xmath78",

    "the general spin - taste index structure of these operators ( ignoring factors of @xmath11 in @xmath501 ) is the following : @xmath502 because mesonic operators of @xmath1 have no derivatives , invariance under the lattice symmetries implies that they must be _ singlets under hypercubic rotations_. as was discussed previously , both @xmath503 and @xmath504 contain a singlet and a 3-d irrep .",
    "thus their product contains two overall singlets ",
    "one from the product of the singlets and one from the product of the 3-d irreps .",
    "only the latter gives new operators , for it contains a part in which @xmath505 , confirming our initial guess . the @xmath3-taste symmetry breaking operators arising from double insertions of @xmath497",
    "$ ] are given in the first two panels of table  [ tab : a4_ffb ] .",
    "next we proceed to mixed - spin operators , i.e. the result of an insertion of @xmath506 $ ] with an insertion of @xmath507 $ ] .",
    "these operators have identical chiral structures to the ones in the top portion of table  [ tab : a4_va_sp ] .",
    "parts of @xmath506 $ ] , since they can be removed by adding an appropriate amount of @xmath508 $ ] , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ app : singleffb ] .",
    "this simplifies the final taste matrix substitution .",
    "] once again , there is only one possible @xmath3-taste breaking index contraction , @xmath509 , but we must still show that this is the correct mapping of the four - fermion operator product . does not produce different operators since these are all just dummy indices . ] in this case , the operators have the following index structure at fixed @xmath78 and @xmath500 : @xmath510 just as before , one hypercubic singlet in this product comes from the two 3-d irreps , and contains a part with @xmath505 .",
    "this generates the @xmath1 mixed - spin operators in the third panel of table  [ tab : a4_ffb ] .",
    "finally we address double insertions of @xmath506 $ ] . this will produce operators with the same chiral structure as double insertions of @xmath508 $ ] .",
    "such operators are given in the bottom portion of table  [ tab : a4_va_va ] .",
    "in this case , multiple combinations of index contractions are possible : @xmath511 and @xmath512 , @xmath513 . both are allowed by the lattice symmetries , but we must determine whether either arises at @xmath1 .",
    "after fixing @xmath78 and @xmath500 , the index structure is @xmath514 now we can see that the only nontrivial way of producing a hypercubic singlet is @xmath505 , just like in the two previous examples .",
    "the indices @xmath413 and @xmath515 are independently summed from the beginning .",
    "we conclude that only the first of the two possible index contractions arises from the double insertion of four fermion operators .",
    "the final panel of table  [ tab : a4_ffb ] shows the @xmath1 chiral operators generated by double insertions of @xmath506 $ ] .    after these examples , it is easy to see that the combination of an @xmath37 four - fermion operator with an @xmath38 four - fermion operator can not generate any additional operators .",
    "this is because , in the @xmath37 operator , spin and taste indices are completely uncorrelated .",
    "thus these operators contain only a singlet under hypercubic rotations , and can only form a overall singlet by combining with the singlet component of the @xmath38 operator . but",
    "doing so removes the correlations between taste indices .",
    "such mixed - symmetry double insertions only modify the coefficients of the @xmath1 @xmath37 operators .",
    "a natural question that arises is what happened to the second possible set of index contractions in the @xmath516 ^ 2 $ ] case , in which both @xmath505 and @xmath517 .",
    "this would lead to mesonic operators such as @xmath518 i.e. with both @xmath78 and @xmath413 appearing four times .",
    "such operators are consistent with all of the lattice symmetries , so they must be present in the chiral lagrangian at some order .",
    "the answer is that these operators _ are _ present , but they are of @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear from the previous examples that contracting the spin indices to make hypercube singlets can never contract all of the taste indices , some of which are independently summed .",
    "thus chiral operators such as ( [ eq : a8 ] ) can only arise if all of the tensor indices are coupled _ in the quark - level operator itself_. this requires a local eight - quark operator , e.g. @xmath519 [ \\bar q(\\gamma_\\mu\\otimes \\xi_{\\nu\\mu } ) q ] [ \\bar q(\\gamma_\\mu\\otimes \\xi_{\\mu\\nu } ) q ] [ \\bar q(\\gamma_\\mu\\otimes \\xi_{\\nu\\mu } ) q ] \\,.\\ ] ] which enters only at @xmath49 .",
    "a more physical way of looking at this is in terms of gluon exchange .",
    "taste - changing interactions are due to the exchange of hard gluons with momentum @xmath520 . to obtain a complete correlation of taste indices",
    "requires a complete correlation of the hard gluon momenta .",
    "this can arise directly , for example , with four bilinears connected by four gluons joining at a four - gluon vertex , as in the above operator .",
    "the presence of four hard gluon propagators gives the factor @xmath521 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 mesonic operators that we are considering arise from two separate insertions of @xmath7 four - fermion operators tied together by gluons from the @xmath522 lagrangian .",
    "in the eight fermion operator with @xmath523 , where @xmath524 is the confinement length scale . ] thus these gluons do not violate taste symmetry .",
    "the correlation between taste indices in the two four - fermion operators can only come _ indirectly _ , through the lorentz structure .",
    "we can check the conclusion that operators such as ( [ eq : a8 ] ) do not appear at @xmath1 by examining the counterterms generated by other @xmath3-taste symmetry breaking operators . consider four - pion vertices generated using the @xmath0 operators from the top portion of table  [ tab : ffb ] . form a single diagram with only four external pions by joining the four pion legs with derivatives to form a loop .",
    "the loop integral couples the indices on the derivatives and gives rise to a quartically divergent counterterm with the following four tastes of external pions : @xmath525 , @xmath526 , @xmath527 , and @xmath528 .",
    "this is of the same form as resulting from the @xmath1 operator that we derived above .",
    "the general conclusion we draw from this discussion is that one _ can not _ determine the staggered chiral lagrangian simply by testing the invariance of all possible operators under all of the lattice symmetries .",
    "while this procedure does filter out incorrect operators , it does not lead to the correct power - counting .",
    "the only foolproof method is therefore to map each quark - level operator directly onto chiral operators .      up to this stage",
    "we have not explicitly included source terms for left- and right - handed ( or equivalently vector and axial ) currents .",
    "the standard method for doing so is to promote derivatives to covariant derivatives , @xmath529 and enforce local chiral symmetry  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath530 and @xmath531 are , respectively , matrix sources for the left and right - handed currents .",
    "one also needs the field strengths associated with these sources , from which one can build contact terms at nlo .",
    "these do not contribute to s - matrix elements or decay constants , however , so we do not list them here .    in continuum",
    "@xmath9pt , the nlo lagrangian takes the same form as that without the sources except for the change of regular to covariant derivatives , aside from aforementioned contact terms .",
    "possible terms involving covariant derivatives acting on @xmath143 or @xmath144 , for example , can be removed using the equations of motion ( eom ) .",
    "this turns out not to be true for s@xmath9pt .",
    "there are additional terms involving covariant derivatives acting on the taste spurions which can not be removed , and which play an important role in the breaking of @xmath3 for axial decay constants . of course",
    ", in addition to these terms one must change regular to covariant derivatives in all the @xmath138 terms given previously .",
    "the extra `` source terms '' are built from a covariant derivative acting on a taste spurion , a second taste spurion ( since they always come in pairs ) , and a lie derivative ( to match the lorentz indices ) .",
    "thus they are of @xmath0 and are produced by single insertions of four - fermion operators .",
    "we run through the possibilities in turn .",
    "we will go through the group theory and operator enumeration rather quickly , as the process is the same as in all previous sections .",
    "we will concentrate instead on eliminating operators through use of the eom , as this is where there is a difference between staggered and continuum @xmath9pt .",
    "operators arising from a single insertion of @xmath345 $ ] can be built out of the left - handed basis in ( [ eqn : basis1 ] ) along with two additional elements : @xmath532 because @xmath273 and @xmath286 transform differently than @xmath67 and @xmath533 , the covariant derivative acts in the following way on the taste spurions : @xmath534\\ , , \\qquad d_\\mu f_r = \\partial_\\mu f_l - i [ r_\\mu , f_r]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : covder1}\\ ] ] once @xmath535 are set to fixed taste matrices , the partial derivative pieces will vanish .",
    "however , the commutator terms can still contribute to the left- and right - handed currents , and therefore to pgb decay constants .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eqn : covder1 ] ) that taste @xmath297 can not contribute , since then the commutator vanishes .",
    "thus we need only consider tastes @xmath145 and @xmath298 , in which case @xmath273 and @xmath286 are supertraceless , and transform as adjoints under the chiral symmetry group .",
    "moreover , @xmath536 and @xmath537 are also supertraceless because of the cyclicity of the supertrace , so they too are adjoints .",
    "thus operators with one taste spurion , one covariant derivative acting on a taste spurion , and one lie derivative will correspond to the singlet irreps in the product of three adjoints .",
    "there are two singlets in this product , and therefore four operators .",
    "these operators are given in table  [ tab : source1 ] .",

    "@xmath540 & yes + 118 . &",
    "@xmath541 & sometimes +    we can remove some of these operators using the eom . first recall ( qualitatively ) how this is done in the case of covariant derivatives acting on mass spurions .",
    "one such operator is @xmath542 .",
    "integrating by parts , the covariant derivative can be moved onto the field , resulting in @xmath543 .",
    "then @xmath544 can be replaced with operators involving either one or no derivatives acting on each of @xmath67 or @xmath533 using the eom , all of which are already included in the standard nlo effective lagrangian . by trying to follow the same procedure for operators involving taste spurions , we will see where it breaks down .",
    "for example , first consider operator 115",
    ". we must be careful when integrating by parts because there are more than just two terms in this operator  we can not simply move @xmath142 from one piece to the other and add a minus sign .",
    "derivatives can be moved around using integration by parts because we are integrating over all spacetime in the action , so total derivative terms become surface terms and can be neglected .",
    "we therefore consider a total derivative term which gives rise to operator 115 : @xmath545 after integrating over all spacetime and taking the supertrace , the l.h.s .",
    "vanishes , so the four operators on the r.h.s . are all related .",
    "the first is operator 115 , while the second is operator 116 .",
    "the third operator is from the lo lagrangian , while the fourth can be related to other standard operators using the eom .",
    "we learn two lessons from this exercise : first , that operators 115 and 116 are redundant  they are related by integration by parts ; second , that we can not remove both using the eom  and we choose to keep operator 115 .",
    "the difference from the example given above of the covariant derivative acting on the mass matrix is the presence of _ two _ taste spurions in each operator .",
    "integration by parts can never remove the covariant derivative from _ both _ taste matrices and produce something such as @xmath546 , which can be removed using eom .",
    "the same holds for operators 117 and 118 ; we can remove only one of these two using the eom , and we choose to keep operator 117 .",
    "operators arising from a single insertion of @xmath547 $ ] can be built similarly out of the left - handed basis in ( [ eqn : basis2 ] ) plus the elements @xmath548 in this case @xmath448 and @xmath449 transform in the same way as @xmath67 and @xmath533 , so @xmath549 neither @xmath550 nor @xmath551 ( or their parity conjugates ) are supertraceless , so they transform as bifundamentals .",
    "thus all operators with one @xmath384 , one @xmath552 , and a lie derivative come from singlet irreps in the product of two bifundamentals with one adjoint .",
    "there are four such singlets , and eight such operators , given in table  [ tab : source2 ] .",

    "operator pairs 119 & 120 , 121 & 122 , 123 & 124 , and 124 & 125 are each related in this way , and we choose to keep only the first operator in each pair .",
    "in fact , operator 124 becomes _ equal to _ operator 123 once one uses the result that @xmath561 , i.e. that the spurions are momentum - independent and their product has no taste .",
    "thus we are left with four additional operators .    as in the previous sections , four fermion operators with spin @xmath298",
    "do not lead to any additional mesonic operators , and simply modify some of the unknown coefficients of the spin @xmath297 and @xmath145 operators .",
    "inserting the appropriate taste matrices is now straightforward . we simplify expressions using the fact that @xmath562 .",
    "we also write operators in terms of @xmath530 and @xmath531 because the covariant derivative acts differently on the two types of taste spurions . the final  source term \"",
    "operators are listed in table  [ tab : source_ffa ] .      in section  [ app : singleffb ]",
    "we discussed in detail how to map onto @xmath0 mesonic operators arising from a single insertion of a four fermion operator in @xmath114 , so we just summarize the result here : the _ chiral _ structures are the same as those of single @xmath37 insertions , but the _ index _ structures are different , breaking @xmath3-taste and lorentz symmetry .",
    "simply put , each @xmath38 operator is identical to the corresponding @xmath37 operator , but with the derivative indices contracted with a pair of taste indices .",
    "however , there is one important difference : because the indices on the covariant derivative and the taste matrices are _ correlated _ , the number of operators can _ no longer be reduced _ using the eom .",
