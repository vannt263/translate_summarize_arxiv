    "pairing correlations play an essential role in the determination of the ground - state structure of the vast majority of atomic nuclei . among its treatments ,",
    "an easy but still enough accurate one is to consider only single - particle states near the fermi level while the effects of the other states are assumed to be absorbed in the strength of an effective pairing interaction .",
    "in such a treatment , our experiences in hartree - fock(hf)+bcs calculations suggest that at least half of a major shell above the fermi level must be considered for meaningful estimations . as a consequence",
    ", one has to explicitly consider positive - energy states if the fermi level of neutrons is higher than the negative of half of the major shell spacing ( @xmath0 mev ) .",
    "this condition applies to about half of the @xmath1 nuclides which exist between proton and neutron drip lines in the nuclear chart , not only to nuclei near the neutron drip line or outside the s - process path .",
    "thus there are plenty of necessities for theoretical frameworks which can describe pairing correlations involving the continuum states .",
    "if the pairing correlation significantly involves the continuum states , the hf+bcs approximation becomes inadequate because the occupation of unbound hf orbitals leads to the unwanted dislocalization of the nucleon density .",
    "this is a serious problem in coordinate - space treatments , which is more favorable to describe loosely bound systems like drip - line nuclei than expansions in harmonic - oscillator eigenstates ( except the transformed oscillator basis of ref .",
    "the reason why a dislocalized solution becomes the variational minimum is that , in order to separate the variational equations into hf and bcs , one has to neglect the effects that the matrix elements of pair - scattering processes are affected by the changes in the wave functions of the orbitals involved @xcite . to fully take into account these effects",
    "leads to the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equation , with which the density is localized whenever the fermi levels are negative @xcite .    the hfb method in the coordinate space",
    "was first formulated using the quasiparticle states and solved for spherically symmetric states in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although spherical solutions can be obtained easily with present computers ( for zero - range forces ) , deformed solutions are still difficult to obtain because there are quite a large number of quasiparticle states even for a moderate size of the normalization box ( i.e. , the cavity to confine the nucleons to discretize the positive - energy single - particle states ) . an orthodox approach to face",
    "this difficulty is the two - basis method @xcite , in which the quasiparticle states are expanded in bound and unbound hf orbitals .",
    "this method requires heavy numerical calculations because there are a pile of unbound hf orbitals below an energy cut - off of even only a few mev .",
    "an alternative approach is the canonical - basis hfb method . according to the bloch - messiah theorem @xcite , every hfb solution obtained as the vacuum of a set of bogoliubov quasiparticles has an equivalent expression in terms of a bcs - type wave function .",
    "the single - particle states appearing in this expression are called the hfb canonical basis . in the canonical - basis hfb method ,",
    "one obtains the solution in the canonical form without using the quasiparticle states .",
    "this method appeared originally in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain spherical solutions .",
    "however , there are no sever difficulties in obtaining hfb solutions for spherical nuclei using any other methods . applications to deformed nuclei have been done by us @xcite using a three - dimensional cartesian mesh representation@xcite . incidentally , a different line of application is also found in literature @xcite .",
    "let us explain the advantage of the canonical - basis method over the two - basis method concerning the treatment of the pairing in the continuum using fig .",
    "[ fig : two_basis_hfb ] . on both sides of the figure , the ordinate represents the expectation value of the mean - field ( hf ) energy , while the abscissa stands for the radius @xmath2 from the center of the nucleus .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 mean a cut - off energy and the fermi level , respectively . on the left - hand side , the wavy horizontal lines stand for energy levels and their spatial extent for the hf potential denoted by a solid curve .",
    "the wave functions of positive energy states extend to the wall of the box and their level density is much larger than that of negative energy states . in the two - basis hfb method",
    ", one has to mix these positive - energy orbitals to construct localized canonical - basis orbitals , which is a numerically demanding task . on the right - hand side ,",
    "the wavy lines represent the hfb canonical - basis orbitals . unlike hf",
    "orbitals , they are spatially localized for both negative and positive energies . because of this localization , the level density is much smaller than the unbound hf orbitals .",
    "therefore , one needs much less orbitals .",
    "more specifically , the number of necessary single - particle states to describe the hfb ground state of a nucleus is proportional to the volume of the nucleus in the canonical - basis method while it is related to the volume of the normalization box in the other methods .",
    "incidentally , with the dash curve , we suggest the existence of some potential which binds the high - lying canonical - basis orbitals .",
    "the identity of this potential is unveiled in sec .  [",
    "sec : canorb ] .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the canonical - basis hfb method on a cubic mesh and develop an efficient gradient method to obtain its solutions . in order to decrease unphysical influences of high - momentum components due to zero - range interactions ,",
    "we introduce a momentum dependent term to the pairing interaction and show how it suppresses a problematic behavior of wave functions peculiar to the canonical - basis hfb method . as a byproduct , we show a clear way to understand the nature of high - lying canonical - basis orbitals .",

    "this cut - off scheme has an disadvantage that the hfb super matrix in eq .",

    "( [ eq : grad_cutoff ] ) the pairing hamiltonian ( the part proportional to @xmath158 in square brackets ) is dependent on the canonical - orbital index @xmath46 .",

    "it may not matter , however , because one does not need hamiltonians to define canonical orbitals when they can be obtained by transforming the quasiparticle states .",

    "hfb method , specifying the number of quasiparticle ( hf single - particle ) states to be considered has the same consequences as imposing an energy cut - off because the states to be chosen are anyway the eigenstates of the lowest energies of the quasiparticle ( hf ) hamiltonian .",
    "on the other hand , the canonical - basis hfb method is very peculiar concerning this point .",
    "the canonical orbitals are not the eigenstates of a single operator but each of them has its own hamiltonian @xmath123 as a function of the occupation probability given by eq .",

    "otherwise , some of the orbitals may become the eigenstates of @xmath125 rather than @xmath124 : we show in appendix [ sec : pointcollapse ] that , if the occupation probability of an orbital becomes sufficiently small , it spontaneously decreases the probability further toward zero ( to decrease the total energy of the nucleus ) and change its hamiltonian to @xmath125 .",
    "this occurs when the pairing force is a delta function ( with or without particle - density dependence ) , for which @xmath125 is a local potential and thus its eigenstates are delta functions in the spatial coordinate .",
    "this means that their @xmath160 is infinitely high . on the other hand , the rest of the orbitals",
    "are left in low - energy subspace of @xmath124 .",
    "therefore the restriction on @xmath55 results in utterly different solutions from those obtained by using a cut - off energy explicitly .",
    "this peculiarity of the canonical - basis method is essential to the implementation of the method . in the quasiparticle and the two - basis methods ,",
    "the unphysical divergence of the pairing correlation strength occur only in the limit of @xmath161 ( supposing @xmath55 is used instead of @xmath147 ) . in the canonical - basis method , in addition to this divergence , a different type of unphysical behavior ( the point collapse ) can also happen for @xmath55 fixed at finite numbers .",
    "one has to take special care of the latter problem if one tries to implement the canonical - basis method .",
    "now , if one can suppress the point collapse , one is allowed to use @xmath55 as the control parameter of the cut - off energy .",

    "the dip emerges at @xmath433 fm when @xmath408= @xmath434 and , as @xmath408 is decreased , its depth increases while the location of the bottom moves to smaller values of @xmath397 .",
    "this minimum in the dip corresponds to hfb `` solutions '' in finite nuclei reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the wave function of a high - lying orbital has shrunken into a mesh point .",
    "hfb states having physically reasonable wave functions turn themselves into such strange states in the following abrupt way : in the course of gradient - method evolutions , suddenly after an almost stationary situation has continued , @xmath275 of a high - lying orbital soars up to a few hundred mev and simultaneously the total energy decreases by a few mev .",
    "the dip is caused by the zero - rangeness of the pairing force and thus does not correspond to physically meaningful states .",
    "physical solutions should be found at @xmath435 fm , where @xmath417 is slightly negative .",
    "therefore one needs to eliminate the effects of such dips in order to obtain well - behaving hfb solutions in the canonical - basis representation .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that a wave packet with @xmath397=0.3 fm can be expressed fairly precisely on a mesh with spacing @xmath195=0.8 fm .",
    "it is because the maximum wave number expressible with the mesh is @xmath436 and thus the minimum size of the wave packet of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavepacket ] ) can be estimated roughly by a relation @xmath403 = @xmath406 @xmath224 @xmath436 , which leads to @xmath437 fm for @xmath195=0.8 fm .",
    "therefore collapses to wave packets as small as @xmath438 fm are a practical problem even when @xmath195=0.8 fm .    before discussing how to remove the dip ,",
    "let us clarify in an analytical way the mechanism which gives rise to the dip .",
    "we consider the limit of @xmath439 , in which the nature of the dip becomes most manifest .",
    "therefore , the following considerations are for the untruncated hilbert space , not for mesh representations .    in order to study this limit ,",
    "we assume a scaling behavior @xmath440 where @xmath397 is the location of the bottom of the dip . @xmath441 and @xmath442 are positive constants to be determined .",
    "one can easily confirm that , for @xmath443 , all the nine terms in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : detot ] ) have positive powers of @xmath397 and thus converge to zero as @xmath444 .",
    "consequently , it must be satisfied that @xmath445 for a point - collapse solution to exist . for @xmath446 , @xmath447 + ( lower order terms in @xmath406 ) and",
    "thus the energy diverges to @xmath448 as @xmath444 .",
    "the only possibility for a point - collapse solution to exist is in the case of @xmath449 , for which @xmath450 + ( terms with positive powers in @xmath397 ) . from a condition",
    "@xmath451 , one immediately finds that @xmath417 becomes minimum at @xmath452 .",
    "the minimum value in the limit @xmath444 becomes @xmath453 its numerical value is @xmath454 mev for the parameters used .",
    "the essential points clarified here are i ) the minimum of the total energy is realized in the limit @xmath455 with @xmath162 and ii ) the limiting value of the minimum energy is finite .",
    "one can also derive analytically the location @xmath397 of the barrier top which divides the physical and unphysical regions . from the condition , @xmath456 one can simply obtain the location of the local maximum as , @xmath457 by neglecting terms of @xmath458 . note that it is independent of @xmath43 ( if @xmath43 is sufficiently small ) . with the parameters used , @xmath459 fm . indeed in fig .",
    "[ fig : shrink ] , the location of the top of the barrier ( designated with open circles ) seems to converge to @xmath151 fm as @xmath408 is decreased .",
    "the height of the maximum is @xmath460 , which is @xmath461 and converges to zero as @xmath462 .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently small values of @xmath43 , hfb solutions easily fall into the unphysical dip since the mesh spacing is much smaller than @xmath463 fm .",
    "the first type of the interaction is the momentum dependent term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair_int ] ) . with @xmath464 , but with @xmath94 , @xmath417 becomes to have additional terms as , @xmath465 where @xmath417 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : detot ] ) and , @xmath466 since @xmath467 , @xmath468 , @xmath469 , and @xmath470 are positive .",
    "the dominant term in the limit @xmath444 is the one having coefficient @xmath469 ( @xmath470 ) for @xmath471 , which behaves as @xmath472 ( @xmath473 ) .",
    "these two terms overwhelm the negative terms in @xmath417 .",
    "consequently wave functions can not shrink to a point .",
    "however , a dip can still emerge with finite @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ fig : shrinkkc ] shows how the local minimum ( the bottom of the dip ) and the local maximum ( the top of the barrier ) of @xmath417 change versus @xmath408 .",
    "the left - hand portion shows the depth and the height ( @xmath417 ) , while the right - hand portion shows the locations ( @xmath397 ) .",
    "the solid curves are obtained with @xmath155 .",
    "the upper solid curve stands for the height of the local maximum , which converges to zero as @xmath474 , as already discussed analytically .",
    "( this curve is almost unchanged when @xmath95 is decreased to finite values . )",
    "the lower solid curve corresponds to the depth of the local minimum , which converges to @xmath454 mev , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq : localmin ] ) .    with finite values of @xmath95 , the minimum becomes shallower as @xmath408 is decreased and it disappears at some small value of @xmath408 .",
    "this disappearance is clearly seen in the dot curve ( corresponding to @xmath95=15 @xmath98 ) in the right - hand portion of the figure .",
    "a numerical search has shown that the dip exists only for @xmath475 @xmath98 .    the result with",
    "this simplified model roughly agrees with realistic hfb calculations : we have observed that point collapses can occur for @xmath476 @xmath98 in calculations like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nw_gap ] .",
    "the difference between 6 @xmath98 and 10 @xmath98 can be partially attributed to the finite - point approximation to the derivatives , which underestimates the kinetic energy by 30% at @xmath477 , as shown in fig .",
    "20 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "incidentally , the requirement of orthogonality among the canonical orbitals does not seem to change the conclusion drawn with this model .",
    "the first reason is that point collapses in light nuclei are not affected by orthogonality if the number of canonical orbitals @xmath55 is relatively small .",
    "this is because of the symmetry ( e.g. , @xmath234 ) of the solution : if a high - lying orbital is the only one in an irreducible representation of the symmetry ( e.g. , in @xmath478=@xmath479 sector when @xmath384-axis is the shortest axis ) , it is automatically orthogonal to the other orbitals . in this case",
    ", it shrinks not to a point but to many points ( e.g. , two points at @xmath480 , @xmath481 , @xmath169 @xmath224 nuclear radius , with opposite - sign amplitudes ) .",
    "indeed , we have experienced that point collapses occur only when @xmath55 is small for relatively small values of @xmath95 .",
    "the second reason is an empirical fact that , with large values of @xmath95 , many orbitals collapse one after another or simultaneously even for large @xmath55 : the process of point collapses under orthogonality condition may not be so complicated as it sounds in such cases .",
    "the second type of the interaction we examine is the pairing density dependent term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair_int ] ) . with @xmath482 , but with @xmath483 , @xmath417 has additional terms to eq .",
    "( [ eq : detot ] ) as , @xmath484 where @xmath485 all the added terms are positive . assuming @xmath440 , terms with coefficients @xmath486 and @xmath487 have negative powers of @xmath397 at @xmath449 .",
    "consequently point collapses can be avoided by using finite values of @xmath415 .",
    "figure  [ fig : shrinkrp ] shows extrema of @xmath417 versus @xmath408 .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to @xmath94 and is the same as that in fig .",
    "[ fig : shrinkkc ] .",
    "the other types of curves are for finite values of @xmath415 .",
    "one can see that @xmath417 at the local minimum is already very small with @xmath488 @xmath92 ( dot curve ) , which is much larger than the typical values of @xmath93 and thus leads to only physically acceptable small amount of modification of the pairing interaction .",
    "this figure is consistent with the results of actual hfb calculations : from fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can see that point collapses can be avoided with @xmath489 @xmath92",
    ".    mathematically speaking , however , the local minimum continues to exist for arbitrary @xmath43 , which is a different behavior from that with finite @xmath95 . in the limit of @xmath462 ,",
    "this minimum behaves as @xmath444 and @xmath490 . because the depth converges to zero from below",
    ", the point - collapse limit is unstable and is not very meaningful .",
    "so , let us give only briefly the result of an analytical consideration . assuming @xmath440",
    ", one can show that the local minimum continues to exist in the limit @xmath444 with @xmath491 and @xmath441 determined by a cubic equation @xmath492 if @xmath493 ( i.e. , @xmath494 for @xmath495 ) . at the local minimum , @xmath496 and @xmath497 .",
    "one can see this scaling behavior with @xmath498 on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : shrinkrp ] .    in the present paper",
    "we have used the momentum dependent interaction because it has a physical origin , i.e. , the finite - rangeness . however",
    ", the pairing density dependent interaction may also be useful under different circumstances because the momentum dependent interaction leads to a divergence of the pairing energy in unrestricted hilbert space @xcite : the assumption of @xmath499 made in this paper is not adequate for orbitals with @xmath500 .    to summarize , assuming a wave function of gaussian form",
    ", we have clarified the mechanism of the point - collapse phenomenon occurring in the canonical - basis hfb method due to delta interactions .",
    "we have also demonstrated the successes of momentum or pairing density dependent interactions in avoiding the collapse .",
