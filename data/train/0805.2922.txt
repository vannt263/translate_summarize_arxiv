    "in recent years , a renewed interest in the casimir effect  @xcite emerged , as a consequence of new , refined experimental techniques  @xcite , which raised the required standards of the theoretical calculations .",
    "they were usually based on gross simplifying assumptions , mostly about the properties of the mirrors . to explain the experimental results , it is then important to use more accurate models , including corrections due , for example , to the imperfect nature of the mirrors .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the calculation of the fermionic casimir effect for imperfect ` mirrors ' , in a functional integral framework . in a fermionic context",
    ", the mirrors are meant to partially reflect the fermionic current ; including as a particular case the ` bag ' boundary conditions , where the current is completely reflected .    from a technical point of view , we shall use an adapted version of a previously used functional approach  @xcite , to cope with the case of fermionic fields and imperfect boundaries . in the fermionic context , this method had already been applied to the case of fermions in @xmath3 dimensions satisfying bag conditions on a curve and coupled to a gauge field  @xcite .    to cope with imperfect mirrors , which will occupy parallel planes ,",
    "we follow  @xcite to introduce a coupling of the bilinear @xmath4 to a @xmath0-function potential of the proper coordinate .",
    "we shall then calculate the resulting casimir energy as a function of the distance between two mirrors , using to that effect a functional formalism which maps the original problem to a one - dimensional one , where the fields live on the surfaces of the mirrors .",
    "we show that exact results may be obtained by for @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions ; for the @xmath1 dimensional case our result in the perfect bag case agrees with the one of  @xcite , in spite of the fact that the treatment of the problem is quite different ; in particular , the description of the interaction can not be mapped in a straightforward manner from one calculation to the other .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] we introduce the method in general ; in  [ sec : casimir ] we apply it to the calculation of the casimir energy for two imperfect mirrors in @xmath1 and @xmath2 spacetime dimensions . in section  [ sec : bag ]",
    "we analyze the relationship between this kind of interaction and the bag boundary conditions , which emerge when the coupling constant takes a particular value .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we shall introduce the method used for the calculation of the vacuum energy , in the presence of ` defects ' which generate the approximate bag - like boundary conditions , for the case of a fermionic field in @xmath5 spacetime dimensions .",
    "our approach is based on the well - known property that the vacuum energy , @xmath6 , may be obtained from the euclidean functional @xmath7 , as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the extension of the ( imaginary ) time coordinate . on the other hand , in the functional integral representation",
    ", @xmath10 is given , for a dirac field , by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , the euclidean action , will be such that @xmath13 , with @xmath14 which are the free and interaction actions , respectively .",
    "in the last equation , @xmath15 denotes a ` potential ' , introduced in order to simulate the boundary conditions .",
    "although we shall mostly consider just the cases of one or two defects , we write ( for the sake of generality ) its expression for a system with @xmath16 equally - spaced defects : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the coupling constant , whose role in imposing an approximate boundary condition is discussed in section  [ sec : bag ] .",
    "it is worth noting here that , as mentioned in  @xcite , dirac s equation with this kind of potential is not well - defined .",
    "however , also in  @xcite , a consistent calculation of the casimir energy for a dirac field in @xmath1 dimensions could still be performed , since one can set up the problem in terms that avoid the calculation of the eigenstates of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "we shall here use an approach that also bypasses the eigenproblem for the dirac hamiltonian , relying instead on the corresponding euclidean propagator .",
    "the reason this can be done is , of course , that the vacuum energy may be expressed as a function of the expectation values of fermionic bilinears which are , at least in this case , well - defined even when the eigensystem is not .",
    "of course , the total energy for this kind of potential will be , since there is translation invariance along the coordinates parallel to the surface of the mirrors , proportional to the ` area ' of each defect ; thus we will be interested in evaluating energy densities , or pressures , rather than the extensive quantity @xmath6 ( except the @xmath21 case where the two quantities coincide ) .",
    "in @xmath22 spatial dimensions , the defects are co - dimension @xmath23 hyperplanes . putting the system in a @xmath24-dimensional ` box ' of side @xmath25",
    ", we obtain the vacuum energy density @xmath26 dividing @xmath6 ( calculated for such a box ) by @xmath27 , and then taking the @xmath28 limit : @xmath29 we have denoted by @xmath30 the coordinates in @xmath5 dimensional spacetime @xmath31 .",
    "it will turn out to be convenient to introduce also coordinates @xmath32 , for the subset of the @xmath33 spacetime components that parametrize the @xmath34 defect s world - volume , as @xmath35 .",
    "analogously , momentum - space coordinates in @xmath5 dimensions are denoted by @xmath36 , while @xmath37 is reserved for its @xmath33-dimensional restriction : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the momentum component along the normal direction to the mirrors .    in terms of these conventions",
    ", we have : @xmath40 which , following the methods of  @xcite , may be written in an equivalent way by introducing a pair of auxiliary grassmann fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 for each defect .",
    "the vacuum functional then adopts the form : @xmath43 \\;\\exp      \\big [ \\sum_{\\alpha = 0}^{n - 1 }       \\int d^{d+1}y\\;\\chi^2_\\alpha(y ) \\nonumber\\\\      & + & g \\",
    ", \\int d^{d+1}x\\int d^{d+1}x'\\ , \\bar\\eta ( x)\\ ,      g^{(0)}(x , x')\\,\\eta(x')\\big]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath44 while @xmath45 is the vacuum functional in the absence of defects : @xmath46 on the other hand , @xmath47 is the free fermion propagator .",
    "note that the auxiliary fields are naturally defined on each one of the mirrors world - volumes .",
    "since we are interested in calculating the dependence of @xmath26 on the positions , @xmath48 , of the defects , we shall discard any constant which is independent of those variables .",
    "constant factors in the functional integral , like @xmath45 , generate precisely that kind of constant , which we shall therefore ignore ( without bothering to rename the corresponding subtracted quantity ) .    replacing ( [ def : eta ] ) into ( [ eq : z2 ] ) , we may write the latter in the more explicit form : @xmath49 \\ ; e^{\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta = 0}^{n - 1}\\int d^{d+1}y\\int d^{d+1}y'\\ , \\bar\\chi_\\alpha ( y)\\ , \\mathcal{k}_{\\alpha \\beta}(y , y')\\,\\chi_\\beta(y ' ) } \\;,\\ ] ] where we introduced the matrix kernel : @xmath50 where each @xmath51 element is also a matrix in dirac space .",
    "the formal result of evaluating the integral above is then : @xmath52\\ ] ] where the determinant is meant to affect all , continuum and discrete , variables .",
    "this means that : @xmath53 where ` @xmath54 ' is the trace over continuous and discrete indices  .",
    "since there is invariance under translations in the @xmath55 coordinates , we may fourier transform with respect to them .",
    "the kernel becomes then block diagonal in the continuous variables ; besides , a proper counting of the modes in the box shows that the @xmath56 factor is cancelled by an identical one coming from the numerator ; thus , in the limit , @xmath57 \\;,\\ ] ] where the tilde has been used to denote fourier transformation , and ` @xmath58 ' denotes trace over the @xmath59 and dirac indices only .    in the following section",
    ", we deal with the evaluation of the previous expression for @xmath26 in the most relevant case , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "besides the subtraction of the vacuum energy in the absence of the defects , there is another constant to get rid of : the self - energy of the defects .",
    "it may be identified as the result of evaluating @xmath26 for @xmath61 .",
    "thus the prescrition for such a subtraction , which will render a finite quantity as a result , is to subtract from @xmath26 its limit when @xmath62 .",
    "of course , to give meaning to the expression at intermediate steps , a regularization is introduced .",
    "since the last subtraction brings into play the self - energy of the defects , we present first @xmath63 , where the self - energy first emerges , and then the @xmath60 case where we evaluate the energy for the case of two defects , identifying and subtracting the contributions of the self - energies of the two mirrors .      for @xmath64 ,",
    "the @xmath65 matrix has only one element ( @xmath66 ) , thus there is no need to use @xmath67 , @xmath68 indices : @xmath69 so that @xmath26 becomes : @xmath70\\big\\ } \\;.\\ ] ]    when @xmath21 , the euclidean gamma matrices have the single eigenvalues @xmath71 .",
    "then the vacuum persistence amplitude is : @xmath72 which has a logarithmic uv divergence , easily regularized by using a frequency cutoff .    a lengthier , but quite straightforward calculation shows that , in @xmath73 : @xmath74\\;,\\ ] ] which is quadratically divergent .",
    "again , an euclidean can be used to give meaning to the integral , whose explicit form we do not need : indeed , it will emerge in the next subsection only to be subtracted in order to fix the energy to zero when @xmath62 .      when @xmath75 the matrix @xmath76 is given by @xmath77\\ ] ] with @xmath78 as defined in ( [ eq : defw ] )",
    ".    using the property : @xmath79\\ ] ] for the determinant of the matrix in ( [ eq : k2 ] ) , we may identify the first two factors above as yielding the self - energies for the defects , as studied in  [ ssec : one ] .",
    "we first introduce an uv cutoff to give meaning to those two factors ( the third factor is convergent ) before subtracting the corresponding self - energies .",
    "the resulting pressure is : @xmath80 \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath81    let us now evaluate @xmath26 above for @xmath21 and @xmath82 .",
    "in one spatial dimension , if we take into account dirac s indices , @xmath83 is a matrix with two @xmath84 blocks , while @xmath85 is just a @xmath86 matrix .",
    "a somewhat lengthy but otherwise straightforward calculation shows that the latter has eigenvalues @xmath87 given by : @xmath88 ^ 2}\\,e^{-2l|q_0| } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the trace in the expression for the vacuum energy can be calculated exactly . in the massless case",
    ", we can obtain the exact expression for the energy as a function of @xmath20 , since : @xmath90\\;,\\ ] ] or , @xmath91 where @xmath92\\,,\\ ] ] is a dimensionless constant which determines the strength of the casimir interaction , and @xmath93 denotes the polylogarithm function . in figure ( [ fg : casimir2pd1 ] ) , we plot the dimensionless combination @xmath94 as a function of the ( also dimensionless ) variable @xmath20 , for the massless case , and for different values of @xmath95 , corresponding to the massive case ( where there is no closed expression for the energy ) .",
    "note that there is a maximum at @xmath96 .",
    "that value , as explained in the next section , corresponds to exact bag boundary conditions , where the boundaries are more effective and as a consequence the energy reaches it maximum possible value : @xmath97_{g=2 } \\;=\\ ; - \\frac{\\pi}{24 l}\\;\\ ] ] note that in the approach of reference  @xcite , bag conditions correspond to an infinite coupling constant .",
    "the difference is explained , of course , by the different meaning of the coupling constants in both cases .",
    "for example , the propagator in our approach includes tadpole - like propagation between the wall and itself , which naturally change the effective value of the coupling constant",
    ". nevertheless , our @xmath96 agrees with @xmath98 .    a fuller explanation of this fact is given in section  [ sec : bag ] , where we derive the form of the fermion propagator in the presence of the defects , studying its behaviour close to the boundary .
