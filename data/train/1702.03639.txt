    "the phrase ` anomalous is normal ' says that anomalous diffusion phenomena are ubiquitous in the natural world .",
    "it was first used in the title of @xcite , which reveals that the diffusion of classical particles on a solid surface has rich anomalous behaviour controlled by the friction coefficient .",
    "in fact , anomalous diffusion is no longer a young topic . in the review paper @xcite",
    ", the evolution of particles in disordered environments was investigated ; the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion were considered ; and the generalizations of einstein s relation in the presence of disorder were discussed . with the rapid development of the study of anomalous dynamics in diverse field ,",
    "some deterministic equations are derived , governing the macroscopic behaviour of anomalous diffusion . in 2000 ,",
    "metzler and klafter published the survey paper @xcite for the equations governing transport dynamics in complex system with anomalous diffusion and non - exponential relaxation patterns , i.e. , fractional kinetic equations of the diffusion , advection - diffusion , and fokker - planck type , derived asymptotically from basic random walk models and a generalized master equation .",
    "many mathematicians have been involved in the research of fractional partial differential equations ( pdes ) . for fractional pdes in a bounded domain @xmath0 ,",
    "an important question is how to introduce physically meaningful and mathematically well - posed boundary conditions on @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "microscopically , diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration ; for the normal diffusion ( brownian motion ) , the second moment of the particle trajectories is a linear function of the time @xmath4 ; naturally , if it is a nonlinear function of @xmath4 , we call the corresponding diffusion process anomalous diffusion or non - brownian diffusion @xcite .",
    "the microscopic ( stochastic ) models describing anomalous diffusion include continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) , langevin type equation , lvy processes , subordinated lvy processes , and fractional brownian motion , etc .. the ctrws contain two important random variables describing the motion of particles @xcite , i.e. , the waiting time @xmath5 and jump length @xmath6 .",
    "if both the first moment of @xmath5 and the second moment of @xmath6 are finite in the scaling limit , then the ctrws approximate brownian motion . on the contrary , if one of them is divergent , then the ctrws characterize anomalous diffusion .",
    "two of the most important ctrw models are lvy flights and lvy walks . for lvy flights ,",
    "the @xmath5 with finite first moment and @xmath6 with infinite second moment are independent , leading to infinite propagation speed and the divergent second moments of the distribution of the particles .",
    "this causes much difficulty in relating the models to experimental data , especially when analyzing the scaling of the measured moments in time @xcite . with coupled distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( the infinite speed is penalized by the corresponding waiting times ) , we get the so - called lvy walks @xcite .",
    "another idea to ensure that the processes have bounded moments is to truncate the long tailed probability distribution of lvy flights @xcite ; they still look like a lvy flight in not too long a time .",
    "currently , the most popular way to do the truncation is to use the exponential tempering , offering the technical advantage of still being an infinitely divisible lvy process after the operation @xcite . the lvy process to describe anomalous",
    "diffusion is the scaling limit of ctrws with independent @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is characterized by its characteristic function . except brownian motion with drift , the paths of all other proper lvy processes are discontinuous .",
    "sometimes , the lvy flights are conveniently described by the brownian motion subordinated to a lvy process @xcite .",
    "fractional brownian motions are often taken as the models to characterize subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "macroscopically , fractional ( nonlocal ) pdes are the most popular and effective models for anomalous diffusion , derived from the microscopic models .",
    "the solution of fractional pdes is generally the probability density function ( pdf ) of the position of the particles undergoing anomalous dynamics ; with the deepening of research , the fractional pdes governing the functional distribution of particles trajectories are also developed @xcite .",
    "two ways are usually used to derive the fractional pdes .",
    "one is based on the montroll - weiss equation @xcite , i.e. , in fourier - laplace space , the pdf @xmath7 obeys @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fourier transform of the initial data ; @xmath10 is the laplace transform of the pdf of waiting times @xmath5 and @xmath11 the laplace and the fourier transforms of the joint pdf of waiting times @xmath5 and jump length @xmath6 . if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are independent , then @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the pdf of @xmath6 .",
    "another way is based on the characteristic function of the @xmath14-stable lvy motion , being the scaling limit of the ctrw model with power law distribution of jump length @xmath6 . in the high dimensional case , it is more convenient to make the derivation by using the characteristic function of the stochastic process . according to the lvy - khinchin formula @xcite , the characteristic function of lvy process has a specific form @xmath15 where @xmath16 \\nu(d \\bf{x});\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath17 is the indicator function of the set @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a positive definite symmetric @xmath21 matrix and @xmath22 is a sigma - finite lvy measure on @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 and @xmath20 are zero and @xmath25 the process is a rotationally symmetric @xmath26-stable lvy motion and its pdf solves @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xcite . if replacing ( [ powerlawmeasure ] ) by the measure of isotropic tempered power law with the tempering exponent @xmath29 , then we get the corresponding pdf evolution equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined by ( [ temperedfraclaploperator ] ) in physical space and by ( [ fouriertemperedlaplacian ] ) in fourier space .    in practice",
    ", the choice of @xmath32 depends strongly on the concrete physical environment .",
    "for example , figure [ figure1 ] clearly shows the horizontal and vertical structure .",
    "so , we need to take the measure as ( if it is superdiffusion ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 belong to @xmath36 .",

    "one can see the review paper @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the second moment and the discontinuity of the paths of lvy flights predicate that the corresponding diffusion operators should defined on @xmath38 , which further signify that if we are solving the equations in a bounded domain @xmath0 , the information in @xmath39 should also be involved .",
    "we will show that the generalized dirichlet type boundary conditions should be specified as @xmath40 .",
    "if the particles are killed after leaving the domain @xmath0 , then @xmath41 , i.e. , the so - called absorbing boundary conditions . because of the discontinuity of the jumps of lvy flights , a particular concept ` escape probability ' can be introduced , which means the probability that the particle jumps from the domain @xmath0 into a domain @xmath42 ; for solving the escape probability , one just needs to specify @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 for the corresponding time - independent pdes . as for the generalized neumann type boundary conditions ,",
    "our ideas come from the fact that the continuity equation ( conservation law ) holds for any kinds of diffusion , since the particles can not be created or destroyed . based on the continuity equation and the governing equation of the pdf of lvy or tempered lvy flights ,",
    "the corresponding flux @xmath47 can be obtained .",
    "so the generalized reflecting boundary conditions should be @xmath48 , which implies @xmath49 .",
    "then , the generalized neumann type boundary conditions are given as @xmath50 , e.g. , for ( [ fractionallaplacian ] ) , it should be taken as @xmath51 .",
    "the well - posednesses of the equations under our specified generalized dirichlet or neumann type boundary conditions are well established .",
    "overall , this paper focuses on introducing physically reasonable boundary constraints for a large class of fractional pdes , building a bridge between the physical and mathematical communities for studying anomalous diffusion and fractional pdes . in the next section",
    ", we recall the derivation of fractional pdes .",
    "some new concepts are introduced , such as the tempered fractional laplacian , and some properties of anomalous diffusion are found . in sec . 3",

    "are given in the last section .",
    "for well understanding and inspiring the ways of specifying the ` boundary constrains ' to pdes governing the pdf of lvy flights or tempered lvy flights , we will show the ideas of deriving the microscopic and macroscopic models .      for the microscopic description of the anomalous diffusion",
    ", we consider the trajectory of a particle or a stochastic process , i.e. , @xmath52 . if @xmath53 , the process is normal , otherwise it is abnormal .",
    "the anomalous diffusions of most often happening in natural world are the cases that @xmath54 with @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "a lvy flight is a random walk in which the jump length has a heavy tailed ( power law ) probability distribution , i.e. , the pdf of jump length @xmath56 is like @xmath57 with @xmath58 , and the distribution in direction is uniform . with the wide applications of lvy flights in characterizing long - range interactions @xcite or a nontrivial `` crumpled '' topology of a phase ( or configuration ) space of polymer systems @xcite , etc , its second and higher moments are divergent , leading to the difficulty in relating models to experimental data .",
    "in fact , for lvy flights @xmath59 with @xmath60 . under the framework of ctrw , the model lvy walk @xcite can circumvent this obstacle by putting a larger time cost to a longer displacement , i.e. , using the space - time coupled jump length and waiting time distribution @xmath61 .",
