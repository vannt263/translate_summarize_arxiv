    "the time - integrated and time - resolved spectra of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) differ .",
    "the general appearance of time - integrated grb spectra is that of a smoothly broken power law .",
    "time - integrated photon number spectra from missions prior to the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ with its burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) were often fitted with an `` optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung '' ( ottb ) spectrum , @xmath2 , combined with a power law at larger energies .",
    "band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that nearly all time - integrated batse spectra were well fitted by the `` band '' function consisting of two power laws , @xmath3 at low energies and @xmath4 at high energies , smoothly joined by an exponential roll - over characterized by a constant @xmath5 .",
    "the band function index , @xmath6 , shows a broad peak between -1.25 and -0.25 ( band et  al .",
    "1993 ) , instead of the earlier claimed universal value of -1 , @xmath7 clusters fairly narrowly around -2.1 ( preece et  al .",
    "1997 ) , while @xmath5 has values between 100 kev and 1 mev , but mainly clustering around 100 - 200 kev ( band et  al . 1993 ) .",
    "time - resolved spectra , even within single pulses , show strong time evolution , and are , in general , harder than time - integrated spectra ( _ e.g. _ , pendleton et  al . 1994a , ford et  al .",
    "1995 , liang & kargatis 1996 , hereafter lk96 , crider et  al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "most importantly , lk96 found that the peak energy , @xmath8 , of the time - resolved @xmath9 spectra of a single pulse in a number of bright and smooth grbs , decays exponentially as a function of photon fluence , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the maximum value of @xmath8 within a pulse , @xmath12 is the photon fluence integrated from the time of @xmath11 , and @xmath13 is the exponential decay constant .",
    "furthermore , crider et al . ( 1997a ) found the instantaneous band function index , @xmath14 , in general to be hard , @xmath15 , reaching values as large as + 1.6 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show the consequences of the time evolution of @xmath16 , for the time - integrated grb spectrum of a single pulse , as well as for a number of pulses , and to determine the meaning of @xmath13 .",
    "the following notation is used : @xmath17 ( photons @xmath18 s@xmath19 ) is the photon number flux of the burst at time @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( photons @xmath18 s@xmath19 kev@xmath19 ) is the instantaneous spectrum of the burst at photon energy @xmath22 ( kev ) at time @xmath20 . here , @xmath23 is the photon number flux at time @xmath20 within an energy interval @xmath24 around @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath25 ( photons @xmath18 kev@xmath19 ) is the time - integrated spectrum of the burst and @xmath8 is the peak photon energy of @xmath26 spectra .",
    "the total photon number fluence is @xmath27 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "note that @xmath28 .    in   2 ,",
    "we show analytically that the exponential @xmath8-decay implies that the time - integrated spectrum of a single pulse should have a typical asymptotic low energy behavior of @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the same low energy power law slope as the ottb spectrum ( the `` universal '' @xmath30 ) , and with the asymptotic low energy normalization given by @xmath13 .",
    "modifications to this behavior below @xmath11 are shown to be approximately given by an incomplete gamma function . in   3 , we discuss the implications for the overall spectra of grbs and in   4 , we illustrate our analytical findings by analyzing spectral data from the bright burst , grb 910807 .",
    "in particular , we show that the decay constant , @xmath31 , of the spectral evolution is consistent with the asymptotic normalization of the time - integrated spectrum . finally , in   5",
    ", we discuss the effects of a time - varying spectral shape and illustrate using grb 950525 and grb 921207",
    "we present a scenario in which the shape of the time - integrated spectrum is a direct consequence , and therefore a probe of , the specific time - evolution of the instantaneous spectra .",
    "we assume the latter to be peaked in the @xmath32 spectrum , _ i.e. _ , have a peak energy @xmath33 around which the number of emitted photons dominate , which is equivalent to that the power law indices @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is indeed the case in most studied pulses ( see , _ e.g. _ , crider et  al .",
    "1997a ) , except at the very end of the pulse decay , when slopes with @xmath36 sometimes are observed .",
    "this does not necessarily contradict the following discussion , as it can be ascribed to the possible presence of a soft component ( preece et  al .",
    "1996 ) and the contributions of previous ( possibly untriggered or unresolved ) pulses .",
    "it should also be noted that the determination of @xmath6 becomes more difficult the closer the peak energy is to the low energy boundary of the observed spectral range . in any case , such a soft contribution should be negligible compared to the total fluence for the discussion below to be useful .    integrating the instantaneous spectra over some time interval ( @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) of the pulse",
    ", the time - integrated spectrum becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if equation ( 1 ) is valid during the time interval being considered , we have @xmath42 where we introduce a new function , @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the energy dependence of @xmath44 normally is on the ratio @xmath45 , but that its spectral shape could be time dependent , adding additional dependence on @xmath46 or @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore define a function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and where the function @xmath49 describing the instantaneous spectral shape is normalized to unity , @xmath50 .",
    "then the time - integrated spectrum , equation ( 2 ) , becomes @xmath51 introducing @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is normalized to unity , @xmath55 , we find that @xmath56 where the correction factor @xmath57 and where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we show below that the @xmath22-dependence of @xmath60 is rather weak between @xmath61 and @xmath11 for the cases we consider . the first factor in ( 5 ) , describing the over - all spectral shape , shows that the time - integrated spectrum of a single pulse , which has an exponentially decaying peak energy , is a power law with a time - integrated spectral index of @xmath62 between @xmath63 and @xmath11 normalized by the decay constant @xmath64 .",
    "this result points out how the instantaneous and the time - integrated spectra are related .",
    "it shows that the exponential decay behavior of the instantaneous spectra leaves a signature on the time - integrated spectrum : the decay constant , @xmath64 , is its asymptotic low energy normalization and the `` universal '' time - integrated @xmath65 is obtained .",
    "the only assumption made for the derivation is the empirical relation ( 1 ) shown so far to be valid for numerous burst pulses ( lk96 , crider et al .",
    "1997a , c ) , but whose exact validity must be explored .    equation ( 1 ) means that a linear increase in fluence by equal steps of @xmath64 photons @xmath18 corresponds to a decrease of @xmath66 in equal logarithmic steps .",
    "the instantaneous spectra are , roughly , dominated by the about @xmath64 photons @xmath18 in a logarithmic interval around @xmath67 , and as a result @xmath68 is a constant @xmath69 . as @xmath70 also is the time - integrated specific flux spectrum ,",
    "it is clear that the photon spectrum , @xmath71 of a single pulse has a slope of @xmath72 .",
    "the ottb - like spectrum is thus a result of the _ exponential _ decay of the peak energy versus photon fluence .",
    "let us now study the behavior of @xmath60 when we can neglect the time - dependent changes of the instantaneous spectral shape , _",
    ", when the @xmath73 dependence of @xmath74 in equation ( 6 ) can be neglected .",
    "it has been shown for several bursts that the time - resolved spectra are well fitted by the band function and therefore it is of interest to use the band function in ( 6 ) . however , before discussing these results , we study two conceptually simpler approximations , which are valuable in illustrating the resulting behavior of the time - integrated spectrum .",
    "firstly , in the case of integrating over all energies , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( due to the normalization of @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 is an exact solution of ( 5 ) .",
    "the shape of the instantaneous spectra does not affect the normalization and shape of the time - integrated spectrum as long as the instantaneous @xmath80 spectra are peaked with the band indices @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then the dominant contribution to the integral comes from @xmath83 and @xmath60 is convergent .",
    "secondly , if we consider finite integration limits in ( 6 ) and replace the instantaneous spectra with a dirac delta function at @xmath84 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we arrive at a similar result : @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 otherwise .",
    "instantaneous spectra broader than a delta function will introduce deviations from the @xmath90 power law found in the previous case .",
    "we now consider the band function in ( 6 ) .",
    "changing variables to @xmath91 and thus @xmath92 the band function becomes @xmath93 for @xmath94 to be a continuous function , we have @xmath95 and the normalization , @xmath96 , gives @xmath97.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the incomplete gamma function ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , press et  al .",

    "equation ( 5 ) , together with ( 9)-(11 ) , relates the shape of the time - integrated spectrum to the five parameters of the instantaneous spectra and their time evolution , @xmath14 , @xmath105 , @xmath64 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the general behavior of the result ( 9)-(11 ) is captured well in an approximation where the instantaneous spectra are described as exponentially cut - off power laws , @xmath112^{-1 } y^{\\ai } e^{-y}$ ] , where @xmath113 .",
    "this corresponds to a band function without a high energy power law , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the case with @xmath114 .",
    "the result of the integration using this approximation has the advantage of resulting in the very simple analytical expression , equation ( 10 ) , valid at all energies .",
    "the effects on the time - integrated spectrum due solely to a finite high energy cut - off energy , @xmath115 , is easily seen in ( 10 ) . by letting @xmath116 and thus @xmath117 , the first term on the right - hand - side of equation ( 10 ) equals unity .",
    "similarly , a non - zero @xmath63 will give rise to deviations from the @xmath0-law .",
    "asymptotically , at @xmath118 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath119 , the time - integrated spectrum approaches @xmath120 _ i.e. _ , the time - integrated spectrum takes the low energy shape of the instantaneous spectrum .    the result of integrating instantaneous spectra described by band functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , equations ( 9)-(11 ) , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the spectra are in the form of the correction factor , @xmath60 , and are plotted against @xmath121 for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "the time - integrated specific flux spectra , @xmath122 , would be a constant @xmath123 in the delta function approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 . here , with a more realistic description of the instantaneous spectra , there are deviations from the constant @xmath31 in a boundary interval below @xmath115 .",
    "the width of this boundary interval depends on the shape of the instantaneous spectra themselves . with an instantaneous photon index of @xmath124",
    ", the integrated spectrum will never reach the asymptotic level of @xmath31 .",
    "the solid curves in figure 1 show the effect on the @xmath125-spectrum , due to the existence of a maximal peak energy .",
    "the dotted curves also include the effect of a low energy bound to the peak energy .",
    "as seen in figure 1 , the existence of a maximum and minimum peak energy makes the time - integrated photon band - index , @xmath126 , that one would obtain when fitting the spectrum , take a range of values enclosing the `` universal '' value of -1 .",
    "this would correspond to part of the `` diversity '' of @xmath126 seen by band et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "it is useful to introduce @xmath127 as the peak photon energy of the instantaneous @xmath128 spectra as the existence of such a peak corresponds to the assumptions of the presented scenario ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) . in the case of the band function , @xmath8 and @xmath33",
    "are related through @xmath131 . the exponential decay found by lk96 holds for both @xmath33 and @xmath8 as they used a constant @xmath14 in their study .",
    "the total time - integrated specific flux ( kev @xmath18 ) of a pulse , @xmath132 , is dominated by the @xmath64 photons @xmath18 in a logarithmic interval near @xmath133 , and we thus expect @xmath134 . indeed , performing the analytical integrations over @xmath22 , using @xmath135 for the delta function case and",
    "the exponentially cut - off power law case , both give @xmath136 .",
    "a similar result is obtained for the band function case when the time - integrated @xmath137 , but as @xmath138 approaches -2 , the high energy power law makes an increasing and non - negligible contribution .",
    "the total energy of a pulse coming from an isotropic grb at a distance @xmath139 is approximately given by @xmath140 , making @xmath64 a useful quantity for estimating global energetics .",
    "the derived time - integrated spectrum , equation ( 5 ) , is for a single pulse within the grb .",
    "most grbs , however , consist of several overlapping or resolved pulses .",
    "if the @xmath63-values of all pulses are below the minimum energy of the observed spectrum , then all pulses should have a similar low energy slope according to our derivation , but their @xmath11 and @xmath31 may differ .",
    "the sum of a number of time - integrated pulse spectra will lead to a total spectrum with two spectral `` breaks '' , one at the @xmath11 of the individual pulse with the smallest @xmath11 , and the second at the largest @xmath11 .",
    "the time - integrated low energy spectrum of @xmath141 pulses in a burst is the sum of the individual pulse spectra , @xmath142 which would give @xmath143 below the smallest @xmath11 .",
    "this slope may , however , not be observable due to the curvature of the individual pulse spectra ( see fig . 1 ) and as the smallest @xmath11 may be close to or below the minimum energy of the observed spectrum . between the smallest and the largest @xmath11",
    ", the spectrum will be a superposition of individual pulse spectra and the spectral shape will be determined by the distributions of @xmath64 and @xmath11 among the pulses . if , for instance , @xmath64 is the same for all pulses and their @xmath11 is evenly distributed in logarithmic energy , the spectrum @xmath144 will be constant , _",
    "i.e. _ , the photon index will be @xmath145 . above the largest @xmath11",
    ", the spectrum will show the high energy behavior of individual pulses .",
    "the spectral diversity seen when fitting time - integrated spectra of grbs ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) is therefore expected to mainly be due to the different statistical distributions of @xmath64 and @xmath11 in different grbs .",
    "the spectra of individual pulses , on the other hand , are expected to have a spectral shape similar to the ones shown in figure 1 .",
    "simple grbs with few pulses may have bumpy spectra ( possibly producing previously studied line features , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , pendleton et  al .",
    "1994b ) , while complex grbs with many pulses will have smooth spectra .",
    "the spectra plotted in figure 1 resemble real grb pulse spectra . to illustrate this and the discussion above",
    ", we wish to study a bright burst , exhibiting a smooth , long , single pulse , as well separated as possible from other pulses .",
    "generally , the first pulse in a burst of several separated pulses should be least contaminated by soft contributions from previous pulses .",
    "there are only a few bursts that satisfy these requirements , _",
    "e.g. _ , the first pulse in the bright grb 910807 ( trigger numbers 647 ; 3rd batse catalogue , meegan et  al .",
    "furthermore , this burst has very hard time - resolved spectra and no significant evolving spectral shape .",
    "the spectra only evolve in the sense that the peak energy decreases .",
    "this motivates the use of our approximation in our deduction of the analytical expressions for the time - integrated spectrum , in which we neglected the explicit @xmath8-dependence .    in figure 2",
    ", we have plotted the time - integrated spectrum of the large area detector ( lad ) data for the first pulse of grb 910807 .",
    "it is the specific flux spectrum , _ i.e. _ , @xmath146 , and therefore the @xmath64 value can directly be read off the ordinate .",
    "the dotted line shows the constant @xmath147-spectrum which is then modified by the @xmath60-factor . the solid curve is the best fit of the analytical result ( 5 ) , with @xmath60 found by integrating the band function , _ i.e _ , equations ( 9)-(11 ) above in  2 .",
    "the parameters of this fit can be compared to the behavior of the time - resolved spectra .",
    "for instance , their exponential decay , described by the decay constant , @xmath64 can be compared to the asymptotic normalization of the time - integrated spectrum .",
    "the best fit to the time - integrated spectrum ( see fig .",
    "2 ) gives the following parameters : @xmath148 @xmath18 , @xmath149 kev , @xmath150 kev , @xmath151 and @xmath152 with @xmath153d.o.f.@xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath155- and @xmath156-parameters in the fit of the time - integrated spectrum should be interpreted as effective values , _",
    "i.e. _ , the values they would have had in the absence of any spectral shape - evolution .    the time - resolved spectra were fitted with the band function with its four parameters : @xmath157 , @xmath156 , @xmath8 , and a normalization .",
    "the fits were good , having an averaged @xmath158d.o.f.@xmath159 .",
    "figure 3 presents the values of @xmath157 and @xmath156 of these fits .",
    "note that there is no great variation in the shape of the spectra , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath157- and @xmath156-parameters remain approximately constant , which makes the use of our approximations in  2 relevant .",
    "the weighted averages of these two parameters are @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "we numerically checked that a weak spectral shape - evolution , e.g. , from @xmath162 to 0.2 gives a time - integrated spectrum almost identical to that for a constant @xmath163 . in search of @xmath64",

    "@xmath8 varied from @xmath166 kev down to @xmath167 kev .",
    "this is merely a factor of two , which results in that the boundary effects become important over the whole spectral range .",
    "note the expected agreement between the fit of the time - integrated spectrum and the parameters from the fits of the time - resolved spectra .",
    "the study above has shown that by merely studying the time - integrated spectrum , information about the instantaneous spectra can be extracted .",
    "this is made possible by knowing in what way the time - integrated spectrum is formed from the intrinsic spectra .",
    "in the discussion above , we assumed that the explicit dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath8 could be neglected , _",
    "i.e. _ , the shape of the instantaneous spectra is time - independent .",
    "this allowed us to find illustrative analytical expressions describing the time - integrated spectrum .",
    "the correction to the general time - integrated spectral shape , due to such a time dependence , is not easily found analytically .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath155 has been observed to vary with time ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , crider et  al .",
    "it is , however , obvious that the effects on the time - integrated spectra should be small for moderately varying pulse shapes , especially in the case of the instantaneous spectra being hard .",
    "a comprehensive study must be made numerically , in which the detailed time - evolution of the spectral shape is modeled .",
    "preliminary results show that the analytical expressions found above , _",
    "i.e. _ , the `` averaged '' spectrum , differ from the numerically integrated spectra , in which @xmath14 is allowed to vary from its minimal to its maximal value , by @xmath168 per cent or less in the most cases . to explore how this affects the fitted parameters , we have studied two bursts in which @xmath14 evolves notably and , in particular , approaches -1 .",
    "it is also of interest to study bursts , in which the peak energy varies over a larger range , and thus revealing more of the underlying @xmath90- behavior , _",

    "( 1997c ) suggest a break in the exponential decay .",
