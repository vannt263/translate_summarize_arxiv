    "up to now one has not been able to observe any contradictions to the predictions of the standard model of particle interactions .",
    "possible deviations from the standard model or revelations of new physics are expected to be quite small at the energies of present accelerators .",
    "future experiments focus on tests of the standard model with an unprecedented precision  @xcite .",
    "the present accuracy of experimental data already demands new levels of accuracy in the theoretical predictions of perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "this requirement leads to the necessity to compute multiloop feynman diagrams beyond the one - loop level ( as a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) . within the standard model",
    "the diagrams of perturbation theory may contain a multitude of internal and external lines with different particles and different masses that makes the task of evaluation of such diagrams rather complicated already at the two - loop level .",
    "the computation of different subsets of diagrams in different regimes of their masses and their external momenta is now an active field of research and often requires extensive use of direct numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "2truecm    among the many two - loop topologies the two - loop sunset diagrams with different values of internal masses as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) have been recently studied in some detail ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in the present note we describe an efficient method for computing and investigating a class of diagrams that generalizes the sunset topology to any number of internal lines ( massive propagators ) in arbitrary number of space - time dimensions .",
    "we call the class of diagrams with this topology water melon diagrams . fig .",
    "1(b ) shows a diagram with water melon topology . in our opinion ,",
    "the method presented in the paper completely solves the problem of computing this class of diagrams .",
    "the method is simple and reduces the multiloop calculation of a water melon diagram to a one - dimensional integral which includes only well known special functions in the integrand for any values of internal masses .",
    "the technique is universal and requires only minor technical modifications for additional tensor structure of vertices or internal lines ( propagators ) , i.e.  tensor particles or / and fermions can be added at no extra cost .",
    "the method can also handle form factor type processes at small momentum transfer  the inclusion of lines of incoming / outgoing particles with vanishing momenta and derivatives thereof with respect to their momenta is straightforward and is done within the same calculational framework .",
    "our final one - dimensional integral representation for water melon diagrams is well suited for any kind of asymptotic estimates in masses and/or momentum .",
    "the principal aim of our paper is to work out a practical tool for computing water melon diagrams . in the euclidean domain",
    "the numerical procedures derived from our representation are efficient and reliable , i.e.  stable against error accumulation .",
    "the most interesting part of our analysis of water melon diagrams is the construction of the spectral decomposition of water melon diagrams , i.e.  we determine the discontinuity across the physical cut in the complex plane of squared momentum .",
    "we suggest a novel technique for the direct construction of the spectral density of water melon diagrams which is based on an integral transform in configuration space .",
    "we compare our approach to the more traditional way of computing the spectral density where one uses an analytic continuation in momentum space .",
    "because the analytic structure of water melon diagrams is completely fixed by the dispersion representation , our attention is focussed on the computation of the spectral density as the basic quantity important both for applications and the theoretical investigation of the diagram .",
    "the complete polarization function can then be easily reconstructed from the spectral density with the help of dispersion relations .",
    "in addition we derive some useful formulas for the polarization function in the euclidean domain and present explicit results for some limiting cases where analytical formulas can be found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the beginning of sec .  2 we describe some general properties of water melon diagrams and fix our notation .",
    "2.1 we introduce the configuration space representation of water melon diagrams . in sec .",
    "2.2 we discuss the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence structure of water melon diagrams and present the way to regularize the uv divergences by subtraction . in sec .",
    "2.3 some previously known results are reproduced using our configuration space techniques .",
    "2.4 contains explicit examples in odd - dimensional space - time . in sec .",
    "2.5 we discuss expansions in masses and/or momenta in the euclidean domain . in sec .",
    "3 we consider the computation of the spectral density of water melon diagrams by analytic continuation in momentum space .",
    "4 is devoted to the direct computation of the spectral density of water melon diagrams without taking recourse to fourier transforms .",

    "sunset - type diagrams are two - point functions with @xmath0 internal propagators connecting the initial and final vertex .",
    "the sunset diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) is the leading order perturbative correction to the lowest order propagator in @xmath5-theory , i.e.  it is a two - point two - loop diagram with three internal lines .",
    "the corresponding leading order perturbative correction in @xmath6-theory is a one - loop diagram and can be considered as a degenerate case of the prior example .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this topology is a correction to the free propagator in @xmath7-theory that contains @xmath0 loops and @xmath8 internal lines ( see fig .",
    "we call them water melon diagrams . in a general field theory the internal lines may have different masses and may carry different lorenz structures or may contain space - time derivatives .",
    "an example of the latter situation is a leading quantum correction in higher orders of chiral perturbation theory for pseudoscalar mesons where the vertices contain multiple derivatives of the meson fields . in order to accommodate such general structures we represent a general water melon diagram as a correlator of two monomials @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 where the fields @xmath11 have masses @xmath12 and where @xmath13 is a derivative with multi - index @xmath14 standing for @xmath15 .",
    "the water melon diagrams are contained in the leading order expression for the polarization function @xmath16 which is explicitly given by a product of propagators and/or their derivatives , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is a derivative of the propagator @xmath19 with respect to the coordinate @xmath20 with a pair of multi - indices @xmath21 .",
    "the propagator @xmath19 of a massive particle with mass @xmath22 in @xmath1-dimensional ( euclidean ) space - time is given by @xmath23 where we write @xmath24 .",

    "the propagator @xmath19 depends only on the length of the space - time vector @xmath26 for which we simply write @xmath20 .",
    "we consider only the case @xmath27 ( equal number of lines at the initial and final vertex ) .",
    "we thus exclude tadpole configurations ( the leaves of this water melon ) which add nothing interesting . taking the limit @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn02 ] ) we get an explicit form of the massless propagator @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the euler @xmath31-function .",

    "this does not change the functional @xmath20-structure and causes only minor modification of the basic technique .",
    "for instance , the propagator for the fermion ( spin 1/2 particle ) is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 is a dirac matrix .",
    "the next generalization consists in extending our configuration space description to the case of particle radiation from internal lines .",
    "the modification of the internal line with mass @xmath22 due to the emission of a particle with momentum @xmath34 at the vertex @xmath35 reads @xmath36 the functional @xmath20-space structure of the corresponding internal line is not changed by this modification .",
    "therefore such contributions can be obtained either by differentiating the original water melon diagram without particle emission with respect to the mass @xmath22 or by direct differentiation of the propagator which leads to a change of the index of the corresponding mcdonald function .",
    "the explicit representation for the modified internal line with mass @xmath22 is given by @xmath37 this modified propagator is a product of some power of @xmath20 and the mcdonald function as in the standard propagator shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn02 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is in the index @xmath38 of the mcdonald function which is inessential for applications .",
    "this does not change the general functional structure of the representation constructed below . if there is only one - particle emission , the form factor type diagrams with any number of massive internal lines can be obtained for any value of @xmath34 in a closed form .",
    "one encounters such diagrams when analyzing baryon transitions within perturbation theory .",
    "the corresponding formulas will be discussed elsewhere . also the change of the mass along the line in eq .",
    "( [ eqn03 ] ) is allowed for vanishing incoming / outgoing particle momenta which allows for the possibility to discuss processes with radiation of gauge bosons such as @xmath39 transition for baryons within the sum rules approach .",
    "as described above , such generalizations can easily be accommodated in our approach without any change in the basic framework . from now on we therefore mostly concentrate on the basic scalar master configuration of the water melon diagram which contains all features necessary for our discussion .",
    "( [ eqn01 ] ) contains all information about the water melon diagrams and in this sense is the final result for the class of diagrams under consideration . of some particular interest",
    "is the spectral decomposition of the polarization function @xmath40 which is connected to the particle content of a model . as a particular example one can consider a water melon diagram with a vertex connecting various particles of the standard model as shown in fig .",
    "the knowledge of the analytic structure of the propagators @xmath19 entering eq .",
    "( [ eqn01 ] ) is sufficient for determining the analytic structure of the polarization function @xmath40 itself . for applications ,",
    "however , one may need the fourier transform of the polarization function @xmath40 given by @xmath41 the tilde `` @xmath42 '' on the fourier transform @xmath43 will be dropped in the following .",
    "the computation of an explicit expression for the fourier transform @xmath44 for three - line ( or two - loop ) water melon diagrams ( the genuine sunset diagram ) is described in a number of papers in the literature . in the standard , or momentum , representation the quantity @xmath44 is calculated from a @xmath45-loop diagram with @xmath45 integrations over the entangled loop momenta which makes the computation difficult when the number of internal lines becomes large .",

    "the key simplifying observation is that the rotational invariance of the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eqn01 ] ) allows one to perform the angular integrations explicitly .",
    "as a result one is left with a one - dimensional integral over the radial variable in eq .",
    "( [ eqn05 ] ) .",
    "the remaining integrand has a rather simple structure in the form of a product of bessel functions and powers of @xmath20 which is a convenient starting point for further analytical or numerical processing .      in the present paper we focus on the technical simplicity and the practical applicability of the configuration space approach to the computation of water melon diagrams as written down in eqs .",

    "was considered in some detail in  @xcite with @xmath20-space integration techniques . as it turns out",
    ", the @xmath20-space technique has not been very successful for general many - loop massive diagrams .",
    "the angular integrations do not decouple and no decisive simplification occurs .",
    "it is the special topology of water melon diagrams which makes the @xmath20-space technique so efficient .",

    "the gegenbauer polynomials are orthogonal on a @xmath1-dimensional unit sphere , and the expansion of the plane wave @xmath52 reads @xmath54 this formula allows one to single out an irreducible tensorial structure from the angular integration in the fourier integral in eq .",

    "( [ eqn07 ] ) is quite universal regardless of whether tensor structures are added or particles with vanishing momenta are radiated from any of the internal lines .",

    "next we discuss the analytic structure of a water melon diagram in the complex @xmath56-plane and also the behaviour of @xmath44 near threshold . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn07 ] ) it is clear that @xmath44 is analytic in the strip @xmath57 . in terms of the relativistically invariant variable @xmath58",
    "this means that the function @xmath59 is analytic for @xmath60 implying that the function @xmath44 becomes singular at the energy @xmath61 in the minkowskian region .",
    "depending on the number of internal lines in the diagram this singularity is either a pole for the most degenerate case of only one single propagator or a cut in the case of several propagators .",
    "the general formula for the fourier transform ( [ eqn07 ] ) allows for an explicit numerical computation for any momentum @xmath56 in the euclidean domain .",

    "for explicit computations in this paper we normally use dimensional regularization , although our particular way of regularization is not always the orthodox one .",
    "the structure of the uv divergence is very simple for the general water melon diagram .",
    "any water melon diagram only has an overall divergence without subdivergences if the @xmath69-operation using normal ordering and vanishing tadpoles ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is properly defined which means that the water melon is stripped off its leaves .",

    "( [ eqn10 ] ) . to make the individual terms meaningful",
    "one has to introduce an intermediate regularization .",
    "this intermediate regularization can in principle be the standard dimensional regularization .",
    "however , the regularization in this particular case can be also achieved by adding a factor @xmath76 to the integration measure which , in practice , turns into @xmath77 in order to keep the overall dimensionality of the diagram correct , where @xmath78 is an arbitrary mass parameter .",
    "thus , all propagators are taken in the form of an integer number of dimensions ( depending on the choice of the space - time ) but the integration measure is modified to provide regularization .",

    "we have introduced an auxiliary regularization in terms of a circle of finite radius @xmath140 which runs around the origin with its pole - type singularities .",
    "the spectral density is independent of @xmath140 , and the parameter @xmath140 completely cancels in the full expression for the spectral density as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn44 ] )",
    ". this must be so since the spectral density is finite for the class of water melon diagrams .",
    "( [ eqn44 ] ) contains no oscillatory integrands ( cf .",
    "( [ eqn31 ] ) ) , and the integration can safely be done numerically .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eqn44 ] ) is a useful alternative representation for the spectral density . in practice the integration over the semi - circles",
    "is done by expanding the integrand in @xmath254 for small @xmath254 and keeping only terms singular in @xmath140 .",
    "the expansion requires only a finite number of terms and is a purely algebraic operation .",
    "then the singularity in @xmath140 exactly cancels against those of the remaining integrals .",
    "this cancellation can also be done analytically leaving well defined and smooth integrands for further numerical treatment .",
    "even if the full computation of the spectral function in the even - dimensional case described here is straightforward it is nevertheless cumbersome . in order to exhibit the essential points in this calculation",
    "we illustrate it with a simple and instructive example .",
    "consider the calculation of the following integral @xmath255 which is rather close in structure to the real case .",
    "due to the singularity at the origin one has to treat the vicinity of the origin carefully .",
    "we proceed by closing the contour to the left @xmath256 the combination in the brackets of the last equation remains finite as @xmath257 .",
    "let us now consider this limit in more detail .",
    "first we split the integration into two parts from @xmath140 to @xmath258 and from @xmath258 to infinity , @xmath259 then the first integral is just a number which can be found numerically with high precision . in the second integral",
    "we can expand the exponent in the integrand and find @xmath260 the singularity has the correct form and the finite series converges well . if one takes a value @xmath261 instead of @xmath258 for the splitting point in eq .",
    "( [ eqn46 ] ) the convergence of the finite series will be very fast .",
    "this procedure would be used for practical integration in a realistic case .",
    "now we give an exact answer for our simple example .",
    "after two integrations by parts we have @xmath262 the last integral is finite at @xmath157 and for our purpose it suffices to compute it in this limit .",
    "the result is @xmath263 where @xmath122 is again the euler s constant .",
    "all these manipulations can be easily done with a symbolic program . for the original integral",
    "one finds @xmath264 thus finally @xmath265 this concludes our discussion of how to treat subtractions in this simplified case .",
    "the generalization to bessel functions is straightforward ( just expand near the origin and get expressions as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn45 ] ) ) .",
    "then the form of the subtraction term depends on the number @xmath0 of propagators in a water melon diagram .",
    "writing down an explicit expression for some @xmath0 is routine and we leave it to the interested user .",
    "all the required expansions can be performed by a symbolic manipulation program .",
    "again for @xmath94 the results for the spectral density can be obtained directly by traditional means through the convolution equation  ( [ eqn27 ] ) .",
    "it leads to a one - dimensional integral representation for @xmath94 . in this respect the representation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn44 ] ) is of the same level of complexity while the convolution equation is even simpler because it includes only an integration over a finite interval .",
    "however , for @xmath197 the convolution equation leads to a two - dimensional integral representation  @xcite . for larger @xmath0",
    "the corresponding technique of convolution includes many - fold integrals and the corresponding recursion relation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn27 ] ) is not very convenient for applications . in the configuration space approach",
    "all formulas remain the same regardless of the number @xmath0 of internal lines and thus this approach must be considered to be superior to the more traditional momentum space approach .    for two - dimensional space - time the representation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eqn44 ] ) is simpler because there is no power singularity at the origin but only a logarithmic singularity which allows one to shrink the contour to a point ( take the limit @xmath257 ) . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath266 for @xmath267 we present our results for the cases @xmath146 and @xmath94 . for the one - loop case @xmath146 one",
    "has @xmath268 which can be integrated explicitly and results in  @xcite @xmath269 this series can of course also be directly obtained by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eqn37 ] ) .    for the case",
    "@xmath94 one obtains @xmath270 again , this result can be obtained by an alternative method , i.e.  by making use of the convolution equation given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn27 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath271-function @xmath272 is the spectral density of the additional internal line with mass @xmath273 . @xmath274 and @xmath275 are the one - loop spectral density given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn37 ] ) . in performing the convolution",
    "one obtains @xmath276 the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eqn48 ] ) is singular at the end points and a numerical evaluation requires some care .",
    "contrary to this , there are no problems when eq .",
    "( [ eqn47 ] ) is used . with modern computer facilities , the integral representation given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn47 ] ) is more suitable for a numerical evaluation than the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn48 ] ) .",
    "the most direct and efficient way of numerical evaluation of the spectral density is the immediate use of eq .",
    "( [ eqn35 ] ) . after choosing the contour to be a straight vertical line in the complex @xmath20-plane with some positive @xmath219 and making change of the variable @xmath277",
    "the integration over @xmath278 is straightforward . for large number of lines @xmath0 in a water melon diagram the convergence of the integral",
    "becomes fast because the integrand falls off as @xmath279 at large @xmath280 .",
    "one finds several correct decimal figures of the result rather easily using an ordinary personal computer .",
    "a good check for the quality of numerical results obtained in this way is their independence of @xmath219 .",
    "the results must be the same for any particular choice of @xmath219 .",
    "finally we return to the threshold behaviour of the spectral density . using the results of the above",
    "analysis one arrives at expressions of the general form @xmath281 where @xmath282 is either @xmath283 or @xmath250 .",
    "the convergence at large @xmath284 ( at the upper limit of the integral ) is controlled by the factor @xmath285 as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn41 ] ) , and the corresponding expansions in the variable @xmath286 in the region @xmath287 can be constructed .",
    "as shown before , the spectral density for odd - dimensional space - time is known exactly .",
    "its threshold behaviour is easily extracted and one obtains @xmath288 at @xmath22 close to @xmath160 .    in the realistic case of four - dimensional space - time",
    "the threshold behaviour of the spectral density can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eqn35 ] ) ( and , also , eq .  ( [ eqn49 ] ) ) . substituting the asymptotic limit of modified bessel functions at large arguments we infer from the simple dimensional considerations that @xmath289 at @xmath22 close to @xmath160 , where @xmath0 is the number of internal lines of the water melon diagram .",
    "one obtains @xmath290 for @xmath146 and @xmath291 for @xmath94 at @xmath22 close to @xmath160 .",
    "the threshold behaviour agrees with the one extracted from the explicit formula given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn36 ] ) or with the threshold behaviour derived from the convolution equation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn27 ] ) .",
    "other space - time dimensions can be analyzed along the same lines .",
    "for the sake of completeness we briefly comment on the opposite limit for the spectral density when @xmath292 . in this limit",
    "the external energy is much larger than all masses .",
    "the limiting behaviour of this kinematic configuration can be found by utilizing the massless approximation for the correlator where analytical expressions are available .",
    "subleading corrections can be obtained using known techniques  @xcite .",
    "we have described a novel technique that reduces the computation of any water melon diagram to a simple one - dimensional integral with known functions in the integrand .",
    "additional tensor and form factor structures can be easily included without modification of the basic formulas .",
    "different regimes of behaviour with respect to mass / momentum expansions can be easily analyzed and the results can be found analytically if no more than two dimensionful parameters ( one mass and momentum or two masses ) are treated exactly and other parameters are considered to be small and are treated in series expansions . explicit analytical formulas ( with even that last integration being performed in closed form ) are given for the case of any odd number of space - time dimensions . the analytic continuation to the minkowskian region , i.e.  to the positive @xmath144-axis has been performed and the discontinuity across the physical cut is explicitly given .",
    "this allows one to compute general @xmath0-particle phase space for any kind of particles both with different masses and lorentz structures .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the spectral density can be easily investigated based on such a representation . in the even - dimensional case the final integration for an arbitrary water melon diagram",
    "was not done explicitly since we encountered products of bessel functions which we were unable to integrate in a closed form .",
    "this forces one to use numerical integrations in the even - dimensional case if numerical results are desired for large @xmath0 .",
    "however , the analytic structure of the solution for the diagram is fully determined which makes the numerical treatment rather reliable and fast . in this sense",
    "the computation of water melon diagrams has been converted to the routine procedure of getting numbers . except for some special cases",
    "the final one - dimensional integral representation was not further reduced to known simpler functions .",
    "this is quite familiar from the theory of special functions where many special functions are represented through one - dimensional integrals which can not be further reduced to known functions . in this sense",
