    "the physics of the top quark @xcite will be intensively studied in the coming years . the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "will copiously produce top quarks and allow to scrutinize top quark properties . any new physics related to the top quark will be uncovered or stringently constrained @xcite .",
    "one striking property of top quark in the standard model ( sm ) is its extremely weak flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) interactions due to the gim mechanism : they are absent at tree - level and highly suppressed at loop - level @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of top quark fcnc processes will serve as a sensitive test of the sm and a powerful probe of new physics .    in the extensions of the sm",
    ", the top quark fcnc interactions may be enhanced through two ways .",
    "one is that at loop - level the gim machanism does not work so well since the loops may contain new particles , such as the superparticles predicted in supersymmetric models @xcite and the mirror particles in little higgs models @xcite .",
    "the other is that some models like the tc2 models @xcite may predict tree - level top quark fcnc yukawa couplings with scalar fields , which is in contrast with the sm where the generation of fermion masses is realized by simply introducing yukawa couplings with only one higgs doublet and , as a result , the yukawa couplings can be diagonalized simultaneously with the fermion mass matrices . for the top quark fcnc interaction @xmath8 , although it can be greatly enhanced in new physics models , the extent of enhancement is different for different models . at the same time , in tc2 models a large flavor mixing between the right - handed top and charm quarks can also induce a large yukawa coupling @xmath6 ( this is in contrast to the usual cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing which involves only left - handed fermions in the charged weak current ) .",
    "so both the fcnc top couplings @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and the flavor - changing bottom coupling @xmath6 are quite special in tc2 models , which may serve as a sensitive probe of tc2 models .",
    "since the exotic top or bottom processes induced by the anomalous couplings in tc2 models have been studied for hadron or linear colliders @xcite , we in this work focus on the relevant processes in the lepton - hadron collisions . as we know",
    ", the linac - ring type colliders @xcite were proposed more than thirty years ago . starting from the 1980 s",
    ", this idea has been revisited with the purposes of achieving high luminosities and high energies .",
    "generally speaking , the most popular @xmath11 colliders are based on the following suggestions .",
    "firstly , thera @xcite with @xmath12 tev and @xmath13 was included in the tesla tdr @xcite ; secondly , the possibility to intersect clic ( @xmath14 gev ) with lhc @xcite was discussed as a qcd explorer ; finally , a comparison of @xmath15-linac and @xmath15-ring versions of the lhc and vlhc based @xmath11 colliders is performed in ref . @xcite and",
    "the linac options are shown to be preferable .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath16 colliders @xcite with the same order of luminosity and energy can be realized on the base of the linac - ring @xmath17 colliders using the compton backscattering of laser beam off the high energy electron beam .",
    "it is known that the linac - ring type colliders have been playing a crucial role in particle experiments @xcite .",
    "for example , the hera with @xmath18 tev extended the kinematical region by two orders both in high @xmath19 and small @xmath20 with respect to the fixed target experiments .",
    "however , the region of sufficiently small x ( @xmath21 ) and simultaneously high @xmath19 ( @xmath22 gev@xmath23 ) , where saturation of parton densities should manifest itself , is not currently achievable .",
    "the investigation of physics phenomena at extreme small @xmath20 but sufficiently high @xmath19 is very important for understanding the nature of strong interactions at all levels from nucleus to partons . at the same time , the results from the linac - ring type colliders are necessary for adequate interpretation of physics at future hadron colliders . concerning the on - going lhc , an @xmath11 or @xmath16 collider with @xmath24 tev will be very useful for the precision era of the lhc . such a linac - ring collider is competitive to future hadron or linear colliders in search for the new physics .    in this work we focus on the high energy @xmath11 collider @xcite and assume the center - of - mass energy @xmath25 tev for an illustration .",
    "we will study the productions of a single top or bottom quark associated with a scalar in the @xmath0-p collision option of such an @xmath11 collider , which proceed via the subprocesses @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mediated by the anomalous top coupling @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these processes may also serve as one of the materials to demonstrate the necessity of constructing the @xmath11 and @xmath16 collider .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we take a look at the tc2 models , and give the feynamn rules needed in the calculation . in sec .",
    "iii we present the calculations for the processes at the @xmath16 colliders .",
    "discussions and the conclusion are given in sec .",
    "to solve the phenomenological difficulties of traditional tc theory , tc2 theory@xcite was proposed by combing tc interactions with the topcolor interactions for the third generation at the scale of about 1 tev . in tc2 theory ,",
    "the tc interactions play a main role in breaking the electroweak symmetry .",
    "the extended tc(etc ) interactions give rise to the masses of the ordinary fermions including a very small portion of the top quark mass , namely @xmath26 with a model dependent parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the topcolor interactions also make small contributions to the ewsb , and give rise to the main part of the top quark mass , @xmath28 .",
    "after all of the dynamical symmetry breaking there are three nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) from the tc sector , and three ngbs from top condensation sector .",
    "one linear combination of these , mostly favoring the tc ngbs , will become the longitudinal @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the orthogonal linear combination will appear in the spectrum as an isovector multiplet of pseudo - ngb(pngb)s , @xmath31 .",
    "these objects acquire mass as a consequence of the interference between the dynamical and etc masses of the top quark , i.e. , the masses of the @xmath31 will be proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to the @xmath31 as _ top - pions ( @xmath33 , @xmath34)_. for @xmath35 , we will find that the top - pions have masses of order @xmath36 gev .",
    "they are phenomenologically forbidden from occurring much below @xmath37 gev @xcite due to the absence of the decay mode @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , the generation of a large fermion mass such as @xmath39 is a difficult problem in theories of dynamical ewsb .",
    "the idea of the top quark mass as a `` constituent '' , dynamical mass generated by the presence of a condensate @xmath40 addresses this problem , providing at the same time a source of dynamical ewsb not requiring large amounts of new matter . in the original top - condensation standard model  @xcite ,",
    "the formation of the @xmath40 condensate is fully responsible for the masses of the sm gauge bosons as well as for the dynamical generation of @xmath39 .",
    "if the scale of the interaction driving the condensation is @xmath41 , then at lower energies there is a scalar doublet , the top - higgs , which acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . just as in the sm",
    ", the ngb are eaten by the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , leaving a neutral , cp - even scalar particle in the spectrum .    in the tc2 scenario",
    "the top - pions acquire masses in the range @xmath44 gev .",
    "the neutral cp - even state analogous to the @xmath45 particle in low energy qcd , the top - higgs , is a @xmath46 bound state and its mass can be estimated in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in the large @xmath47 approximation , to be @xmath48 this estimate is rather crude and it should be taken as a rough indication of where the top - higgs mass could be .",
    "masses well below the @xmath46 threshold are quite possible and occur in a variety of cases  @xcite .    for tc2 models ,",
    "the underlying interactions , i.e. topcolor interactions , are non - universal and therefore do not possess a gim mechanism . when the non - universal interactions are written in the mass eigenstates , it may lead to the flavor changing coupling vertices of the new particles . such as , the neutral scalars predicted by this kind of models have the flavor changing scalar coupling vertices . the coupling forms of the scalars @xmath33 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 to the ordinary fermions can be written as@xcite : @xmath51 , \\label{fcnh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the factor @xmath52 ( @xmath53 gev , @xmath54 gev ) reflects the effect of the mixing between the top - pions and the would - be goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the rotation matrices that transform respectively the weak eigenstates of left - handed and right - handed up - type quarks to their mass eigenstates , which can be parametrized as @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 denoting the topcolor contribution to the top quark mass . in eqn.([fcnh ] ) we neglected the mixing between up quark and top quark .",
    "we can see from eqn.([fcnh ] ) that only a factor @xmath60 , the imaginary unit , is different between the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 couplings , so the squares of the total amplitude of the two processes @xmath61 and @xmath2 are the same with the same scalar masses .",
    "we in following discussion , take the neutral top - pion @xmath34 as an example unless stated otherwise .",
    "note that the @xmath4 and @xmath6 couplings are quite large in the tc2 prediction , the @xmath6 coupling strength , @xmath62 with @xmath63 ,",
    "so there is no wonder that one expects they may induce larger contributions to the relevant processes . at the same time , the coupling strength yields @xmath64 for @xmath65 , so we can safely conclude that the tc2 coupling as eqn .",
    "[ fcnh ] still makes the perturbative expansion valid in spite of its large value .",
    "( @xmath66 , @xmath10 , @xmath33 and @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) mediated by the anomalous couplings @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath69.[fig:1],width=377 ]    the productions of the neutral and charged top - pions at the @xmath70 collision is mediated by the flavor changing @xmath71 and @xmath72 via the subprocess @xmath73 and @xmath74 with the relevant feynman diagrams shown in figure 1 . using the couplings given in eqn.[fcnh ] , we can write the amplitude @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the subprocesses @xmath73 and @xmath77 , respectively : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , the charge of charm quark(bottom quark ) and @xmath82 are the momentum of top quark , charm quark and photon , respectively .    the cross sections for the subprocess @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath85 with @xmath86[\\hat{s } -(m_{t }",
    "-m_{\\pi})^{2 } ] } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the center - of - mass energy of the subprocesses in @xmath88 collision .    the total cross - section for the main process @xmath89",
    "is obtained after the integration of @xmath90 over the quark and photon distributions . for this purpose",
    "we make the following change of variables : first expressing @xmath91 as @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and furthermore calling @xmath97 , @xmath98 then one obtains @xmath99 .",
    "the limiting values are @xmath100 in order to get rid of the background effects in the compton backscattering , particularly @xmath101 pair production in the collision of the laser with the high energy photon in the conversion region , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105",
    ". then we can write the total cross - section as@xcite : @xmath106    where @xmath107 denotes the energy spectrum of the back - scattered photon for unpolarized initial electron and laser photon beams given by@xcite @xmath108 the definitions of parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 can be found in @xcite . in our numerical calculation , we choose @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath115 is the distribution of charm - quarks inside the proton .    in our numerical calculation",
    ", we use the cteq6l @xcite parton distribution functions and take factorization scale @xmath116 and the renormalization scale @xmath117 as @xmath118 . to make our predictions more realistic , we applied some kinematic cuts .",
    "we require that the energy of @xmath0 and the initial charm quark be larger than @xmath119 gev and the separation of two particles states be more than @xmath120 in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "moreover , for the final particles , we require that the transverse momentum of each produced particle be larger than @xmath119 gev .      for the sm parameters , we take @xmath121 gev , @xmath122 gev , @xmath123 gev , @xmath124 @xcite and use the one - loop running coupling constant @xmath125 .     of the process",
    "@xmath1 as a function of @xmath126 for @xmath127 tev and three values of the parameter @xmath32.[fig:2 ] , width=453 ]     of the process @xmath128 as a function of @xmath129 for @xmath127 tev and three values of the parameter @xmath32.[fig:3 ] , width=453 ]     of the processes as a function of @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132.[fig:4 ] , width=453 ]    as for the tc2 parameters , we will consider the masses of the scalars equal to each other , i.e , top - pions , neutral and charged , denoted as @xmath133 when not considering the difference between them . considering the discussion in the previous section ,",
    "we assume @xmath133 are in the range @xmath134 gev , @xmath32 @xmath135",
    ".    the production cross sections of the top - pion @xmath136 and @xmath137 at the @xmath16 collider are plotted in figure 2 and figure 3 , respectively , as functions of the top - pion mass @xmath133 and three values of the parameter @xmath32 : @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "we can see that the production cross sections decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath133 since the final phase space are depressed by the increasing masses of the final scalars .",
    "we can also see from the two figures that the @xmath142 production cross section is far much larger than that of the neutral top - pion in all of the parameter space .",
    "the reason is that , firstly , the final phase space of the @xmath143 is depressed by the top mass comparing to the @xmath144 production , and secondly , the neutral top - pion has a large top mass propagator which could also depress the result . for @xmath145 and @xmath146 ,",
    "the production cross sections of the neutral and the charged top - pion at the @xmath16 collider are about @xmath147 fb and @xmath148 fb , respectively . therefore there may be hundreds of thousand @xmath144 events to be generated per year in most of the parameter space of the tc2 models .",
    "thus , it is quite easy to detect the productions of the charged scalars via the processes @xmath149 at the @xmath16 collisions .",
    "note that the subprocess @xmath150 can also be realized , but it is almost the same as the process @xmath151 with the opposite fermion current .",
    "what makes the difference between the cross section of the two processes is the parton distribution function since one has the quark @xmath152 in the initial states , while the other is the @xmath68 quark .",
    "we believe , however , the difference are small , so we can safely assume the two processes have the same cross section , which has been verified by our calculation . to feel it , we show the dependence of the cross section on the @xmath130 in fig.4 , the same figure as the other processes for comparing with each other .",
    "we should also note that in ref.@xcite the top - pion production is also discussed , however , it is based on the effective coupling @xmath153 at the one - loop level , while in our discussion , the processes are induced by the flavor changing coupling of the scalars directly @xmath71 or @xmath154 at the tree level .    despite the small probability , however , we believe that the top - pion @xmath16 productions are almost free of sm backgrounds since the @xmath155 and @xmath156 couplings in sm are extremely small due to the gim mechanism and the small @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) value in the ckm matrix .",
    "figure 4 displays the dependence of the cross section on the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath130 ( for an simplicity of the statement , we here assume the region of the @xmath159 describes the cm energy varying from hera to thera in the following discussion . ) , taking @xmath160 gev , and @xmath132 , from which we can see the cross section of charged top - pion production has to go down as we get closer to the @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) threshold region and that all the cross sections increase with the increasing @xmath130 , which is one of the main goal for us to raise the collider energy , i. e , to upgrade the hera to thera collider since the latter can provide much larger probability of detecting the same processes .",
    "note that the hera energy ( @xmath163 gev ) is not enough to produce the process @xmath164(we plot it from @xmath165 gev ) since the sum of the masses of the top quark and the top - pion boson is larger than @xmath166 gev , so the thera , with higher cm energy , can open some processes that do not appear in the hera collider , which is also the reason why we carry out our calculation at the thera , but not at the hera collider , i e , why we take the cm energy as @xmath147 tev .",
    "now we further consider the signature of @xmath167 production at the @xmath16 collision since the rate of the @xmath168 production is too low .",
    "for the process @xmath169 , @xmath142 decays to @xmath170 and @xmath171 with the branching ratio about @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively , with the top quark to @xmath174 and @xmath42 to charge lepton and the missing energy , i.e , the @xmath175 signal with @xmath176 , the missing energy , so the mainly sm backgrounds are @xmath177 or @xmath178 , with @xmath179 and @xmath180 and the jet @xmath181 mis - detected as @xmath68 quark .",
    "while the background cross sections are very small , about @xmath147 fb , therefore if the cuts such as , to the @xmath182 etc . , and the b - tagging skill are employed assuming @xmath183 efficiency and @xmath184 mis - tagging , the backgrounds will be depressed violently . if we assume only one fortieth of signal is retained ( considering the top decaying branching ration about @xmath185 to the charged lepton , the signal may still be detected by the @xmath186 collider .",
    "in the framework of the tc2 models , we calculated the productions of a single top or bottom quark associated with a scalar in @xmath0-p collision , which proceed via the subprocesses @xmath61 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mediated by the anomalous top coupling @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . these productions , with extremely small backgrounds in the standard model , were found to be significantly enhanced in the large part of the tc2 parameter space , especially the production via @xmath7 can have a cross section of 100 fb , which may be accessible and allow for a test of the tc2 models .",

    "<S> while extremely suppressed in the standard model , are found to be significantly enhanced in the large part of the tc2 parameter space , especially the production via @xmath7 can have a cross section of 100 fb , which may be accessible and allow for a test of the tc2 models . </S>"
