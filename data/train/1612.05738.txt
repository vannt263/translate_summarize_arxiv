    "the efimov effect has been intensively investigated in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it was predicted by efimov  @xcite that in a system with a scattering length @xmath2 that is large compared to the typical interaction length of the system , a series of universal three - body bound states can be found with a fixed factor between them . in the unitary limit , @xmath3 , the energies of consecutive states fulfil @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a universal factor that does not depend on details of the interaction .",
    "it does depend however on the number of interacting pairs and the mass imbalance , among other things .",
    "the typical spectrum resulting from this is usually depicted in a so - called efimov plot as presented in fig .",
    "[ efimovplot ] .    at ( 1.7,0.5 )   trimers are the solid red lines , the @xmath6 tetramers are the dashed green lines and the @xmath7 dimer threshold is the dotted blue line . since we assume no interaction between the @xmath8 atoms ,",
    "there is only one dimer.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] ; at ( 1.3,3 ) @xmath9 ; at ( 5.6,2.8)@xmath10 ;    the most easily accessible systems experimentally are systems of two species of atoms ( heavy bosons @xmath8 and one light atom @xmath11 ) with a large mass imbalance . there",
    "the efimov effect occurs as well and the large mass imbalance leads to a comparatively small factor @xmath5 between consecutive states  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the standard three - body effect , there has also been a lot of interest in expanding the universal picture into the @xmath12-body sector . in systems of identical bosons , for example , two universal tetramers attached to the lowest efimov trimer",
    "have been found  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "bringing these two aspects together , blume and yan have studied four - body states in a heteronuclear system  @xcite .",
    "they focussed on the negative scattering length side of the efimov spectrum , because this is the side most experiments use for their observations .    to complete this picture",
    "we have studied the side of positive scattering length .",
    "this side can also be seen experimentally , although experiments are complicated by the existence of the shallow dimer .",
    "experiments typically measure atomic losses due to resonant recombination at the threshold , so we have focussed on the region near the dimer threshold using full four - body calculations with the gaussian expansion method  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian expansion method employs the rayleigh - ritz variational principle with base functions that are selected via geometric progression between a minimum and a maximum range .",
    "it uses various representations of the system in jacobi coordinates , which we call rearrangement channels , to cover different possible angular momentum couplings and arrangements .",
    "the total wavefunction @xmath13 the schrdinger equation @xmath14 is projected onto is composed of a set of gaussian functions for each jacobi coordinate , so in the three - body case we have @xmath15_{jm},\\ ] ] with @xmath16    at ( 1.7,0.5 )   three - body system .",

    "[ jacobi ] .",
    "+ the @xmath19 are given by @xmath20 and analogously for @xmath21 , which means for each jacobi coordinate we have 3 parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "more details about this method can be found in  @xcite .",
    "using several rearrangement channels and relative angular momentum configurations , the parameter space increases rapidly for higher @xmath12 systems .",
    "because of this , systematic sampling of base functions was impractical for the four - body system and we employed random sampling within relatively broad ranges to find optimized base functions .",
    "because there is no reason why the @xmath7 interaction should be resonant at the same point as the @xmath25 interaction , we can safely assume @xmath26 and neglect @xmath27 .",
    "adding an interaction between the heavy bosons only moves the whole efimov spectrum up or down  @xcite , which we can do independently by tuning our three - body force .",
    "as we want to focus on universal behaviour we choose effective potentials , which have the added benefit of being numerically well behaved . to keep the calculated energies in the range of validity of the effective theory we add a repulsive three - body force .",
    "the inverse scattering length @xmath10 is roughly linear in the two - body potential strength , which is how we tune it .",
    "@xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 run over the heavy ( @xmath8 ) bosons of mass @xmath31 from @xmath32 , while the @xmath12th atom ( @xmath11 ) is light and of mass @xmath33 .",

    "the scattering length between @xmath7 dimer and @xmath8 atom can be estimated by the inverse trimer binding energy and is very large ( @xmath51 ) so an effective three - body treatment is justified .",
