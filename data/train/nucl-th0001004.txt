    "the @xmath12 reaction on a proton target measured at saclay @xcite has been instrumental in setting the question of the mechanism of @xmath0 excitation in the projectile ( dep ) , which was introduced in @xcite in order to describe the @xmath13 reaction in p and d targets @xcite .",
    "that mechanism plays a negligible role in the @xmath14 reaction on proton targets but is quite important in the same reaction on neutron targets and was predicted to be dominant in the @xmath15 reaction on proton and neutron targets @xcite .",
    "prior to the @xmath12 experiment the relevance of the dep mechanism was a subject of debate @xcite , particularly because of the small strength of this mechanism in the @xmath16 reaction on proton targets , which allowed interpretations omitting it @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 reaction on a proton target is ideal to isolate the dep mechanism since , because of isospin , the @xmath0 excitation on the proton target is forbidden .",
    "this allowed to test the ideas introduced in ref  @xcite and indeed the large peak in the experiment @xcite corresponding to dep was well reproduced@xcite .",
    "in addition to the issues discussed above , the ( @xmath17 experiment @xcite observed a smaller peak at higher excitation energies which was attributed to the roper excitation .",
    "this mode of excitation of the roper is novel , since it involves an isoscalar source , and can be relevant in determining the strength of three body forces @xcite and providing new tools for the comprehension of the @xmath18 and related reactions @xcite .",
    "the strength of the isoscalar @xmath19 transition was determined empirically from the experimental data in @xcite , where the model of @xcite for dep was used and the interference of the two mechanisms was also considered .",
    "the analysis proved consistent with the present knowledge of position , decay width and partial decay widths of the roper and helped to narrow the experimental uncertainties on these magnitudes .",
    "the issue of strong isoscalar excitation of nucleon resonances has captured more attention after the first inclusive @xmath20 data were obtained  @xcite .",
    "the t@xmath21 data obtained at dubna on the proton and @xmath22c , are given in ref  @xcite and the final data tables are published in ref  @xcite . in ref",
    "@xcite polarization observables for the @xmath20 reaction on proton targets are discussed bringing new information on electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron and on mechanisms for strong excitation of nucleonic resonances . the description done in ref  @xcite",
    "was extended to higher energies of around 10 - 15 gev @xcite , showing that the magnitude of the roper excitation can be increased by about one order of magnitude and the relative strength of the roper signal to the one of the dep mechanism becomes of the order of unity , much bigger than in the @xmath23 ) experiment @xcite where it is about 1/4 . in ref",
    "@xcite polarization observables in the @xmath24 on a @xmath11he target are studied with its view towards possible experiments to be carried out at the indiana cyclotron .    the program of nucleon resonance excitation using baryonic interactions is thus catching up , and certainly will bring complementary information to the one obtained with electromagnetic probes or meson induced excitation .",
    "the present work , dep and roper excitation on the @xmath1 reaction on proton targets , should be considered as a complement to the one of the @xmath12 reaction @xcite .",
    "the fact that the deuteron has an isospin @xmath25 makes the two works similar since @xmath0 excitation on the proton target is forbidden in both cases and only dep and roper excitation are allowed in the region which we study .",
    "however , the fact that the deuteron has a total spin @xmath26 induces some differences with respect to the @xmath12 reaction and sets different constraints on the theoretical models . with new experiments on this issue coming ,",
    "the need to have reliable theoretical models to extract the relevant information becomes apparent , and in this sense our present work is a valuable one .",
    "we have taken advantage of the existence of experimental information from saclay measurements of the @xmath1 reaction and we present here a paper where the theoretical ideas are exposed , the data are presented and a discussion is made from comparison of theory and experiment",
    ".    early work on the present reaction at different kinematics is done in ref   @xcite .",
    "we will compare the theoretical results of the model with recent ( d , d ) measurements done at saclay @xcite and older ( d , d ) measurements @xcite done at lower energies and larger angles .",
    "in this section we consider a theoretical model of the @xmath1 reaction on the proton target .",
    "we include two processes , @xmath0 excitation in the projectile and roper excitation in the target , which are shown in fig . 1 and are the dominant processes in this energy region @xcite .",
    "we include both the @xmath27 and @xmath28 decay modes of the roper resonance .",
    "since we need to take care of the interference between the projectile @xmath0 process and the target roper process decaying into @xmath27 , we treat the roper @xmath29 and roper @xmath30 processes separately .",
    "we take the same model which was used to analyze the @xmath31 reaction at @xmath32 @xmath33 and use the same values for all parameters @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath34 decay @xmath0 and roper processes is given by ,    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 ( ... ) is the kllen function and s the mandelstam variable for the initial p - d system , and momentum conservation , @xmath38 is already implied . the projectile @xmath0 mechanism ( @xmath39 ) leads to a @xmath40 through the decay of the @xmath0 .",
    "part of the roper excitation mechanism leads to the same final state through the decay of the @xmath41 into @xmath27 .",
    "we call this latter piece @xmath42",
    ". hence the sum of the two mechanisms leading to @xmath27 is given by ;    @xmath43    the nucleon and deuteron spin sum and average of each @xmath44 and plus the interference term can be written as ,    @xmath45\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46    @xmath47 \\left . \\right\\ } \\ ; \\sqrt{\\frac{- q^2}{\\vec{q}\\ , ^{2}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the propagators of the @xmath0 and roper resonances , @xmath50 the propagator of the @xmath51 meson , @xmath52 the @xmath53 vertex form factor .",
    "the momenta @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the pion momenta in the roper rest frame , pion momentum in the @xmath0 rest frame , and momentum transfer between the nucleons , respectively . @xmath56 and @xmath57 stand for the longitudinal and transverse parts of @xmath58 effective interaction which includes @xmath59 and @xmath60 contributions , where @xmath60 is the landau - migdal parameter which is meant to account for short range corrections to the @xmath61 and @xmath62 exchange .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath64 are coupling constants .",
    "all details , including parameter values , are shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath65 is the deuteron form factor defined as    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the relative wave function of the deuteron obtained from the bonn potential @xcite .",
    "the momentum transfer of the deuteron is denoted by @xmath68 taken in the initial deuteron rest frame .",
    "we have included only the s - wave part of the deuteron wave function for simplicity . the contribution from the target roper process decaying into @xmath28",
    "is calculated separately as ,    @xmath69    using the partial decay width , @xmath70 , whose explicit form is shown in the appendix of ref . @xcite .",
    "this contribution is added to the @xmath34 contributions incoherently .",
    "we compare our theoretical results with two independent experimental data sets .",
    "one has been obtained recently at @xmath71 at saturne  @xcite and another was measured some years ago at @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "first , we consider the new data which were obtained during a short run at saturne with a deuteron beam of 2.3  gev .",
    "the deuterons were directed onto a 4  cm thick liquid hydrogen target with thin ti windows ( 15  @xmath73 ) . after going through a 40  cm thick lead collimator , the scattered deuterons were momentum analyzed at very small angles using the spes4 spectrometer  @xcite with a momentum acceptance of @xmath74  3% and a resolution of @xmath75  10@xmath76 . in the focal plane of the spectrometer , the scattered deuterons were detected using the three front wire chambers of the extended vector polarimeter pomme  @xcite .    in this experiment ,",
    "special care was taken to minimize all possible experimental backgrounds .",
    "a missing mass spectrum was measured at 1.1@xmath77 in five different momentum bites , respectively centered on 2.6 , 2.8 3.0 , 3.2 and 3.45 gev / c , covering an excitation energy region up to 600  mev .",
    "the spectrometer acceptance is 15% of the central momentum leading to smaller momentum bites for higher excitation energies . in order to get the most out of the limited beam time in terms of number of counts in each bite and range of coverage in excitation energy ,",
    "the momentum bites were set as follows : two overlapping bites around 200  mev of excitation energy , where the excitation of the @xmath0 resonance in the projectile is expected , and , three non overlapping bites spanning the excitation energy range from 300 to 600  mev , where the wide roper resonance is expected ( the kinematical limit is at 680  mev of excitation energy ) .",
    "the target was located outside of the magnetic field of the spectrometer so the usual spes4 corrections for correlations between scattering angle and scattered momentum were not necessary .",
    "the cross section spectrum was binned in 10  mev steps of excitation energy . for each setting of the spectrometer ,",
    "empty target measurements were taken for background subtraction .",
    "the ratio of full to empty target was in the range of 8 to 10 dropping to 2 for the lowest setting of the spectrometer ( corresponding to high excitation energies ) .",
    "we could not get clean measurement at momenta smaller than 2.4  gev / c because of the large background due to rescattering through the lead collimator .",
    "when present , this background shows a strong angular dependence ; taking into account the shape of the collimator , different cuts on angular acceptance lead to substantial changes in the shape and slope of the spectrum . for",
    "all momentum bites shown in fig .  2 , the off - line analysis of full versus empty target spectra and software cuts on angular acceptances showed no changes in the shape of the spectrum ; only overall scaling of the spectrum consistent with the changes of the solid angle , were observed .",
    "this extensive off - line analysis led to the conclusion that no significant experimental background was present for these momentum bites .",
    "absolute cross sections were determined using monitors calibrated with the carbon activation method  @xcite .",
    "this is the well tested standard method of normalization used at saturne .    the measured missing mass spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 is dominated by a large structure centered around 200  mev .",
    "this structure has been identified as the excitation of the delta resonance in the incoming deuteron .",
    "the cross section drops sharply between 200 and 300  mev of excitation energy .",
    "between 300 and 600  mev , there seems to be an excess of cross section above the high energy tail of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "there seems to be a discontinuity in the measured cross section around 500  mev of excitation energy .",
    "this corresponds to the highest excitation energy bite that we can cleanly measure and could be affected by the subtraction of a relatively large empty target contribution .    in fig .",
    "2 , we compare our theoretical results ( including all reaction mechanisms described in section 2 ) with these experimental data .",
    "we have plotted on the same figures the different curves corresponding to the excitation of the @xmath0 alone , the excitation of the roper alone and the total cross section taking into account the interference between the two . for the excitation of the roper , the contributions for the @xmath61n and 2@xmath61n channels are also shown .",
    "we see that the projectile @xmath0 excitation makes a large contribution to the cross section around 200  mev .",
    "the calculation correctly reproduces the excitation energy of the @xmath0 and its width , however it over - predicts the cross section at the maximum by at least 20% .",
    "the excitation of the @xmath0 in the projectile can not account for the observed cross section between 300 and 500  mev .",
    "this range of excitation energy is where we are expecting the roper resonance to be and the calculation indeed predicts this excess of cross section to be due to the excitation of the roper resonance .",
    "the calculation again overpredicts the measured cross section in this region .",
    "in order to extract the excitation of the roper in the 200 to 600  mev region , we assume that the shape of the calculated dep is correct and we normalize it to the experimental spectrum at the maximum of the @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to an overall normalization factor of 0.85 .",
    "we then subtract from the measured data the calculated differential cross section for the excitation of the @xmath0 and the interference between roper excitation and @xmath0 excitation in the projectile , as described in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , also multiplied by the same normalization factor 0.85 .",
    "what is left should mainly correspond to the excitation of the roper resonance plus some physical continuum . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the measured data points , the predicted calculations normalized by 0.85 and the excess of cross section left once the dep and interference contributions are subtracted .",
    "the excess of cross section has a maximum around 400  mev , a width at half maximum of about 230  mev , and an asymmetric shape with a long low energy tail .",
    "the calculation of the roper contribution , normalized by the factor 0.85 , agrees qualitatively in shape and strength with the experimental cross section left once we have subtracted the dep and the interference .",
    "only the theoretical peak is shifted to higher excitation energy by about 25 mev .",
    "the total experimental excess cross section , up to 540  mev , is 32  @xmath74  8  mb / sr to be compared to the predicted cross section of 28 mb / sr for the roper resonance .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this experimental cross section should be in principle an upper limit since no underlying continuum corresponding to other physical processes has been subtracted .",
    "however , in @xcite other possible mechanisms were studied , and they were found to be small , leaving only the @xmath0 excitation in the projectile and roper excitation in the target as responsible for the reaction cross section in the energy region studied here . according to this , the signal obtained here for the roper excitation , within experimental and theoretical uncertainties , should be rather fair .",
    "an empirical way to subtract the dep contribution was done in ref  @xcite , and this is shown in fig .",
    "the shape of the excitation of the @xmath0 in the projectile is taken from the measurements of baldini et al  @xcite . the assumption being that at t@xmath2=1.6  gev , the measured spectrum is mainly dominated by the dep mechanism and",
    "therefore its shape is a good empirical shape for this excitation .",
    "this shape is normalized to the data obtained at t@xmath2=2.3  gev , at the maximum of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "once this empirical dep contribution and also the interference contribution evaluated as in the previous case are subtracted , a wide structure is left , centered at 350  mev with a width at half maximum of 230  mev .",
    "the total cross section in this structure ( up to 540  mev of excitation energy ) is of the order of 34  @xmath74  8  mb / sr .",
    "this value is in agreement with our previous determination of the excess cross section .",
    "the shape of the excess cross section is more symmetric than on the previous case and this is possibly due to the fact that the empirical spectrum taken from ref .",
    "@xcite contains already some contribution from the excitation of the roper .",
    "we have also compared our theoretical results with data at @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the data measured at 6.59@xmath77 and 8.05@xmath77 are respectively compared to our predictions in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "our calculated results reproduce the overall shape of the spectrum well . however , the theoretical results are about @xmath79 smaller than the data at 6.59@xmath77 and about @xmath80 at 8.05@xmath77 .",
    "this discrepancy has to be looked , however , in the proper perspective .",
    "indeed , the angles where the cross sections are measured in @xcite are @xmath81 . at the smallest angle",
    "the cross section has fallen by a factor 30 from the forward direction .",
    "this fall down is mostly due to the deuteron form factor which involves large momentum transfers . in this case",
    "our neglect of the d - wave in the deuteron is not justified .",
    "this , and other approximations could explain these discrepancies .",
    "in view of the fact that they represent only about @xmath82 of the integrated cross section , we pay no further attention to these discrepancies , but the qualitative agreement found gives also partial support to the model .    in what follows",
    "we would like to make some estimates of the theoretical uncertainties in the present analysis of the data .",
    "one of the sources of uncertainty is our neglect of the d - wave in the deuteron wave function .",
    "the other one is the possible effect of fermi motion in the deuteron .",
    "these two factors could change the shape on the @xmath0 excitation strength and hence lead to uncertainties in the roper excitation after the dep strength and interference are subtracted from the data .",
    "we begin by the effect of fermi motion .",
    "the deuteron fermi motion is considered here in the same way as done in @xcite .",
    "it affects the @xmath0 propagator which enters the evaluation of the dep mechanism .",
    "this propagator is given by    @xmath83    where the variable s is taken as    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the momenta of the exchanged meson , and the emitted pion , respectively , taken in the frame of reference where the deuteron is at rest . in this approximation",
    "the momentum transfer is shared equally by the initial and final nucleon in the deuteron .",
    "the fairness of this approximation to account for fermi motion of the nucleus was well established in refs @xcite in the study of coherent pion photoproduction with similar momentum transfers as here .",
    "however , in order to see the effects of fermi motion and have a feeling for possible uncertainties from this source we have conducted new calculations in which in eq .",
    "( 10 ) we assume the initial momentum of the struck nucleon of the deuteron to be zero .",
    "this replaces @xmath87 in that equation by @xmath55 .",
    "we can see the results of the new calculation in fig.7 .",
    "we can see that the strength of the @xmath0 excitation is increased by about 20 % .",
    "the prescription followed here to account for fermi motion was found in refs @xcite to be rather accurate , but even then we see that the effects of ignoring it altogether does not bring drastic changes in the cross section .",
    "the possible uncertainties from this source are further minimized if we normalize the theoretical results to the experimental cross section , as we have done in the analysis of this work . indeed , if we do so we obtain the results shown in fig . 8 , which are shown superposed to those of fig.3 .",
    "as we can see there , the differences found between neglecting the fermi motion , or taking it according to our prescription , are very small up to 500 mev of excitation energy , once the normalization of the cross section around the peak of the delta resonance is done .    as for the d - wave of the deuteron we have proceeded as follows : in the evaluation of the deuteron form factor of eq .",
    "( 6 ) we have taken only the s - wave of the deuteron so far .",
    "inclusion of the d - wave into our scheme would lead to two parts .",
    "one with the same structure as we have , which goes with the @xmath88 component of the exponential , but substituting @xmath89 by @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the s and d - wave parts of the deuteron wave function , respectively ) , and another one which goes with the @xmath93 component of the exponential . detailed evaluations of these two parts in the deuteron form factor can be seen in @xcite and there we see that up to 500 mev / c the @xmath94 part of the form factor contributes less than 10% . on the other hand",
    "the difference between the @xmath95 component evaluated with just the s - wave ( normalized to unity ) on the s plus d - wave parts of the deuteron wave function are smaller than 4% up to this momentum . in our case 500",
    "mev / c momentum transfer corresponds to an excitation energy of around 550 mev in fig .",
    "2 , just the tail of the distribution beyond the roper excitation region which we have studied here . on the other hand in the case of fig . 5 , 500 mev / c would appear at @xmath96 around 2.25 gev / c and in fig .",
    "6 one has already 500 mev / c momentum transfer around the peak of the distribution .",
    "hence , our neglect of the d - wave part of the wave function would induce more uncertainties , in the line we discussed above when we discussed the baldini s data .",
    "altogether , we can safely say that in our analysis of the roper excitation the uncertainties coming from the theoretical model and approximations done are at the level of 10 - 15% .",
    "with the help of a theoretical model previously used to analyze the @xmath97 reaction on the proton , exciting the @xmath0 in the projectile plus the roper , we have analyzed data on the @xmath98 reaction on proton targets at a deuteron energy 2.3 gev .",
    "the use of the model becomes necessary because there is an important interference between the mechanism of delta excitation in the projectile and roper excitation in the target ( followed by @xmath27 decay ) .",
    "we observed that the model gave a good reproduction of the shape of the @xmath0 excitation in the target , but the normalization exceeded the data by about @xmath99 . in view of that in order to subtract this contribution and obtain the strength for roper excitation , we found it justified to normalize the theoretical results by a factor 0.85 which leads to good agreement with the data in the @xmath0 excitation region .",
    "similarly we multiplied by the same factor the interference term , calculated theoretically , and these two pieces of `` background '' were subtracted from the measured data in order to obtain the roper excitation strength .",
    "we found a qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for roper excitation of the model , also normalized by the same factor .    in order to estimate uncertainties due to the use of a theoretical model in the analysis we compared our results to those obtained in ref  @xcite , where an empirical approach was used to subtract the dep contribution using the shape of the @xmath0 resonance excitation from a previous measurement at the lower energies , where there should be a small contribution of roper excitation",
    "the results obtained with both methods agree qualitatively , the integrated strengths obtained are similar , only the peaks of the roper strength appear a bit shifted with respect to each other in the two analyses .",
    "we estimate that considering statistical and systematic errors , the latter ones from the model dependence of the subtractions , the strength of the roper determined here is accurate within @xmath100 , and within these errors the agreement with theory can be claimed acceptable .",
    "the shape and the width of the roper strength are compatible with the empirical information about the resonance .",
    "the present analysis confirms the substantial strength for @xmath101 transition in the scalar channel which has been shown already to have important repercussions in different physical phenomena at intermediate energies .    these results , and the importance that the isoscalar excitation of the roper is bound to have in other process , should stimulate further experiments at higher energies .",

    "<S> in this paper we compare a model that contains the mechanisms of @xmath0 excitation in the projectile and roper excitation in the target with experimental data from two @xmath1 experiments on a proton target . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0 excitation in the projectile is predicted close to the observed energy with the correct width . </S>",
    "<S> the theory , however , underpredicts by about 40% the cross sections measured at t@xmath2 = 1.6  gev at angles where the cross section has fallen by about two orders of magnitude . </S>",
