    "big - bang nucleosynthesis in the early universe is thought to produce the light elements d and @xmath2he with small amounts of @xmath3li , @xmath4be and @xmath5b .",
    "since these abundances are used as unique observables to determine the cosmological parameter @xmath6 , careful studies of the few body reactions of light nuclei are highly desired .",
    "stars with various masses provide a variety of production sites for @xmath0he , @xmath7c and heavier elements . very massive stars @xmath8 culminate their evolution by supernova ( sn ) explosions which are also presumed to be most viable candidate for the still unknown astrophysical site of r - process nucleosynthesis . even in the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements , initial entropy and density at the surface of proto - neutron stars are so high that nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) favors production of abundant light nuclei . in such explosive circumstances",
    "few - body reactions play a significant role .",
    "the study of the origin of r - process elements is also critical in cosmology .",
    "it is a potentially serious problem that the cosmic age of the expanding universe derived from cosmological parameters may be shorter than the age of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "since both age estimates are subject to the uncertain cosmological distance scale , an independent method has long been needed .",
    "thorium , which is a typical r - process element and has half - life of 14 gyr , has recently been detected along with other elements in very metal - deficient stars .",
    "if we model the r - process nucleosynthesis in these first - generation stars , thorium can be used as a cosmochronometer completely independent of the uncertain cosmological distance scale .    in this article , we first demonstrate theoretically that supernova explosions of very massive stars could be a viable site for r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "we study the role of few - body reactions and calculate the sensitivity of the r - process yields to the cross section for @xmath0he@xmath1be , this rate is poorly known experimentally but is expected to affect the result strongly .",
    "next we note several key reactions in the r - process which are relevant to the big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "recent mesurements using high - dispersion spectrographs with large telescopes or the hubble space telescope has made it possible to detect minute amounts of heavy elements in faint metal - deficient ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 -2 ) stars .",
    "the discovery of r - process elements in these stars has shown that the relative abundance pattern for the mass region 120 @xmath9 a is surprisingly similar to the solar system r - process abundances independent of the metallicity of the star as shown in fig . 1 . here",
    "metallicity is defined by [ fe / h ] = log[n(fe)/n(h ) ] - log[n(fe)/n(h)]@xmath10 .",
    "it obeys the approximate relation t/10@xmath11yr",
    "10@xmath13}$ ] .",
    "the observed similarity strongly suggests that the r - process occurs in a single environment which is independent fo progenitor metallicity .",
    "massive stars with 10@xmath14 have a short life @xmath15 yr and eventually end up as violent supernova explosions , ejecting material into the intersteller medium early on quickly from the history of the galaxy . however , the iron shell in sne is excluded from being the r - process site because of the observed metallicity independence .",
    "hot neutron stars just born in the gravitational core collapse of sneii release most of their energy as neutrinos during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase .",
    "an intense flux of neutrinos heat the material near the neutron star surface and drive matter outflow ( neutrino - driven winds ) .",
    "the entropy in these winds is so high that the nse favors a plasma which consists of mainly free nucleons and alpha particles rather than composite nuclei like iron .",
    "the equilibrium lepton fraction @xmath16 is determined by a delicate balance between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which overcomes the difference of chemical potential between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , to reach @xmath21 0.45 .",
    "r - process nucleosynthesis occurs because there are plenty of free neutrons at high temperature .",
    "this is possible only if seed elements are produced in the correct neutron to seed ratio before and during the r - process .",
    "although woosley et al .  @xcite demonstrated a profound possibility that the r - process could occur in these winds , several difficulties were subsequently identified .",
    "first , independent non relativistic numerical supernova models  @xcite have difficulty producing the required entropy in the bubble s / k @xmath12 400 .",
    "relativistic effects may not be enough to increase the entropy dramatically  @xcite .",
    "second , even should the entropy be high enough , the effects of neutrino absorption @xmath17 and @xmath22 may decrease the neutron fraction during the nucleosynthesis process . as a result , a deficiency of free neutrons could prohibit the r - process  @xcite .",
    "third , if neutrinos are massive and have approximate mixing parameters , energetic @xmath23 and @xmath24 are converted into @xmath25 due to flavor mixing .",
    "this activates the @xmath17 process and results in a deficiency of free neutrons .    in order to resolve these difficulties ,",
    "we have studied neutrino - driven winds in a schwarzschild geometry under the reasonable assumption of spherical steady - state flow  @xcite .",
    "then , we carried out r - process nucleosynthesis calculations in our wind model  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear reaction network used for light - mass region is shown in fig .",
    "the full network consists of @xmath12 3000 elements including radioactive unstable nuclei up to the plutonium isotopes .",
    "we found  @xcite that the general relativistic effects make expanding dynamic time scale @xmath26 much shorter , although the entropy per baryon increases by about 40 % from the newtonian value of s / k @xmath12 90 . by simulating many supernova explosions ,",
    "we have found some interesting conditions which lead to successful r - process nucleosynthesis  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the best case is for a relatively large neutron - star mass @xmath27 and a neutrino luminosity @xmath28 .",
    "the key to resolve the first difficulty noted above is the short dynamic time scale @xmath29 10 ms .",
    "as the initial nuclear composition of the relativistic plasma consists of neutrons and protons , the @xmath30-burning begins when the plasma temperature cools below t @xmath12 0.5 mev .",
    "the @xmath0he@xmath31c reaction is too slow at this temperature , and alternative nuclear reaction path @xmath0he@xmath32be@xmath33c triggers explosive @xmath30-burning to produce seed elements with a @xmath12 100 .",
    "therefore , the time scale for nuclear reactions is regulated by the @xmath0he@xmath32be .",
    "it is given by @xmath34 .",
    "if the neutrino - driven winds fulfill the condition @xmath35 , then fewer seed nuclei are produced during the @xmath30-process with plenty of free neutrons left over when the r - process begins at t @xmath12 0.2 mev .",
    "the high neutron - to - seed ratio , @xmath36 , leads to appreciable production of r - process elements , even for low entropy s @xmath12 130 , producing both the 2nd @xmath37 and 3rd @xmath38 abundance peaks and the hill of rare - earth elements @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) .    the three body nuclear reaction cross section for @xmath0he@xmath40be is poorly determined experimentally . because two different channels , @xmath41be + n and @xmath42he + @xmath30 , contribute to this process it is also a theoretical challenge to understand the reaction mechanism and the resonance structure .",
    "we show two calculated results in fig .",
    "1 : the solid line displays the result obtained by using the cross section estimated by woosley and hoffman  @xcite , assuming a @xmath41be + n structure for @xmath4be . the cross section estimate may only be good to one order of magnitude . therefore , we also calculated the r - process by multiplying this cross section by a factor of 10 ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "this makes a drastic change in the r - process abundance yields .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies of the @xmath0he@xmath1be reaction are highly desired .    the specific collision time for neutrino - nucleus interactions",
    "is given by @xmath43 @xmath44 10 ms @xmath45 ms holds at the @xmath30-burning site , r @xmath46 100 km .",
    "this resolves the second difficulty : because there is not enough time for @xmath47 s to interact with n s in such rapidly expanding winds , the neutron fraction is very insensitive to the neutrino absorption .",
    "we have recently shown that the neutrino flavor oscillation could destroy the r - process condition if the mixing parameters satisfy 0.3 ev@xmath48 in our wind model .",
    "recent experiments of the atmospheric neutrinos and the missing solar neutrinos have indicated much smaller @xmath49 , while the lsnd experiment suggests larger @xmath49 .",
    "we should wait for more experiments .",
    "we now found that new possible nuclear reaction paths , which were neglected in the previous calculations .",
    "in addition to @xmath0he@xmath32be at relatively late epoch in the r - process , there is also @xmath0he@xmath50li@xmath51b or @xmath3li@xmath52be@xmath53b , followed by @xmath54 and beta - decays .",
    "it is also likely that three - body reactions like @xmath4li@xmath55 , @xmath56b@xmath55 , @xmath57o@xmath55 , @xmath58f@xmath55 , etc .",
    ", may be important .",
    "this has already been pointed out in the inhomogeneous big - bang nucleosynthesis model ( ibbn )  @xcite although the physical conditions are different .",
    "these new paths produce @xmath4be , @xmath5b and even intermediate - mass nuclei 12 @xmath9 a in the ibbn , the abundances of which are many orders of magnitude higher than those of sbbn , as displayed in fig .",
    "this figure shows also the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the rise of the @xmath4be abundance with increasing [ fe / h ] arises from spallation of galactic cosmic rays after galaxy formation .",
    "each solid curve reaches a different abundance plateau for big - bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn or ibbn ) in the limit of [ fe / h ] = -@xmath59 , i.e. t = 0 .",
    "the nuclear physics of the few - body reactions of light neutron - rich nuclei is thus very important not only in studies of r - process nucleosynthesis but in big - bang nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution as well .",
