    "since the seminal works on the small - world phenomenon by watts and strogatz @xcite and the scale - free property by barabsi and albert @xcite , the studies of complex networks have attracted a lot of interests within the physical community @xcite .",
    "most of the previous works focus on the topological properties ( i.e. non - geographical properties ) of the networks . in this sense",
    ", every edge is of length 1 , and the _ topological distance _ between two nodes is simply defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting them .",
    "to ignore the geographical effects is reasonable for some networked systems ( e.g. food webs @xcite , citation networks @xcite , metabolic networks @xcite ) , where the euclidean coordinates of nodes and the lengths of edges have no physical meanings . yet , many real - life networks , such as transportation networks @xcite , the internet @xcite , and power grids @xcite , have well - defined node - positions and edge - lengths .",
    "in addition to the topologically preferential attachment introduced by barabsi and albert @xcite , some recent works have demonstrated that the spatially preferential attachment mechanism also plays a major role in determining the network evolution @xcite .",
    "very recently , some authors have investigated the spatial structures of the so - called _ optimal networks _ @xcite .",
    "an optimal network has a given size and an optimal linking pattern , and is obtained by a certain global optimization algorithm ( e.g. simulated annealing ) with an objective function involving both geographical and topological measures .",
    "their works provide some guidelines in network design . however , the majority of real networks are not fixed , but grow continuously . therefore , to study growing networks with an optimal policy is not only of theoretical interest , but also of practical significance . in this paper , we propose a growing network model , in which , at each time step , one node is added and connected to some existing nodes according to an optimal policy .",
    "the degree distribution , edge - length distribution , and topological as well as geographical distances are analytically obtained subject to some reasonable approximations , which are well verified by simulations .",
    "consider a square of size @xmath10 with open boundary condition , that is , a open set @xmath11 in euclidean space @xmath12 , where  @xmath13 \" signifies the cartesian product .",
    "this model starts with @xmath14 fully connected nodes inside the square , all with randomly assigned coordinates . since there exists @xmath14 nodes initially , the discrete time steps in the evolution",
    "are counted as @xmath15 .",
    "then , at the @xmath16th time step ( @xmath17 ) , a new node with randomly assigned coordinates is added to the network .",
    "rank each previously existing node according to the following measure : @xmath18 and the node having the smallest @xmath19 is arranged on the top . here",
    ", each node is labelled by its entering time , @xmath20 represents the position of the @xmath16th node , @xmath21 is the degree of the @xmath1th node at time @xmath16 , and @xmath22 is a free parameter . the newly added node will connect to @xmath14 existing nodes that have the smallest @xmath19 ( i.e. on the top of the queue ) .",
    "all the simulations and analyses shown in this paper are restricted to the specific case @xmath23 , since the analytical approach is only valid for the tree structure with @xmath23 .",
    "however , we have checked that all the results will not change qualitatively if @xmath14 is not too large compared with the network size .    [ 0.6 ] : ( a ) @xmath7 , ( b ) @xmath24 , ( c ) @xmath6 , ( d ) @xmath25 .",
    "all the four networks are of size @xmath26 and @xmath23.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.8 ] and @xmath4 .",
    "the solid line represents the assumption @xmath27 . in this simulation , we first generate a network of size @xmath28 by using the present optimal growing policy . to detect @xmath29 ,",
    "some test nodes with randomly assigned coordinates are used , and for each test node , following eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the existing nodes with minimal @xmath19 is awarded one point .",
    "the test node will be removed from the network after testing .",
    "the area @xmath29 for the @xmath1th node is approximately estimated as the ratio of the score node @xmath1 has eventually got after all the testings to the total number of test nodes .",
    "the simulation shown here is obtained from 30000 test nodes , and the parameter @xmath30 is fixed.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in real geographical networks , short edges are always dominant since constructing long edges will cost more @xcite . on the other hand , connecting to the high - degree nodes will make the average topological distance from the new node to all the previous nodes shorter .",
    "these two ingredients are described by the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , respectively .",
    "in addition , the weights of these two ingredients are usually not equal .",
    "for example , the airline travellers worry more about the number of sequential connections @xcite , the railway travellers and car drivers consider more about geographical distances @xcite , and the bus riders often simultaneously think of both factors @xcite . in the present model , if @xmath7 , only the geographical ingredient is taken into account . at another extreme , if @xmath31 , the geographical effect vanishes .",
    "1 shows some examples for different values of @xmath5 . when only the geographical ingredient is considered ( @xmath7 ) , most edges are very short and the degree distribution is very narrow . in the case of @xmath24 , the average geographical length of edges becomes longer , and the degree distribution becomes broader .",
    "when @xmath6 , the scale - free structure emerges and a few hub nodes govern the whole network evolution . as @xmath5 becomes very large , the network becomes star - like .",
    "at the @xmath16th time step , there are @xmath32 pre - existing nodes .",
    "the square can be divided into @xmath32 regions such that if a new node is fallen inside the @xmath1th region @xmath33 , the quantity @xmath34 is minimized , thus the new node will attach an edge to the @xmath1th node . since the coordinate of the new node is randomly selected inside the square , the probability of connecting with the @xmath1th node is equal to the area of @xmath29 . if the positions of nodes are uniformly distributed , statistically , the area of @xmath29 is approximately proportional to @xmath35 with a time factor @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "2 shows the typical simulation results , which strongly support the valid of this assumption .",
    "accordingly , by using the mean - field theory @xcite , an analytic solution of degree distribution can be obtained . however , when @xmath38 , most edges are connected to one single node ( see fig .",
    "1d ) , so analytic solution is unavailable . here",
    ", we only consider the case of @xmath39 .",
    "assume @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant that can be determined self - consistently .",
    "using the continuum approximation in time variable @xmath16 , the evolving of node @xmath1 s degree reads @xmath42 with the initial condition @xmath43 .",
    "the solution is @xmath44 where @xmath45 accordingly , the degree distribution can be obtained as @xmath46 the constant @xmath47 is determined by the condition @xmath48 , where @xmath49 signifies the average degree .",
    "the above solution is similar to the one obtained by using the approach of _ rate equation _ proposed by krapivsky _",
    "in addition , one should note that if @xmath6 , the mean - field theory yields a solution @xmath50 , which is comparable to the exact analytic solution @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , the degree distribution obeys a power - law form at @xmath6 , and an exponential form at @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath5 is in the interval @xmath8 , the networks display the so - called stretched exponential distribution @xcite : for small @xmath5 , the distribution is close to an exponential one , while for large @xmath5 , it is close to a power law .",
    "this result is in accordance with the situation of transportation networks .",
    "if only the geographical ingredient is taken into account ( e.g. road networks @xcite ) , then the degree distribution is very narrow . on the contrary , if the topological ingredient plays a major role ( e.g. airport networks @xcite ) , then the scale - free property emerges . when both the two ingredients are not neglectable ( e.g. bus networks @xcite ) , the degree distribution is intervenient between power - law and exponential ones .",
    "[ 0.8 ] ( a ) and @xmath24 ( b ) .",
    "the black squares and red curves represent simulated and analytic results , respectively .",
    "all the data are averaged over @xmath52 independent runs , with network size @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath53 ) fixed.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ 0.8 ] ( a ) and @xmath24 ( b ) . the black squares and red curves represent simulated and analytic results , respectively . all the data are averaged over @xmath52 independent runs , with network size @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath53 ) fixed.,title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "3 shows the simulation results for @xmath6 and @xmath24 .",
    "the degree distribution follows a power - law form when @xmath6 , which well agrees with the analytic solution . in the case of @xmath24 ,",
    "the degree distribution is more exponential .",
    "however , it is remarkably broader than that of the erds - rnyi model @xcite .",
    "note that , the positions of all the nodes are not completely uniformly distributed , which will affect the degree distribution .",
    "this effect becomes more prominent when the geographical ingredient plays a more important role ( i.e. smaller @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , although the simulation result for @xmath24 is in accordance with the analysis qualitatively , the quantitative deviation can be clearly observed .",
    "denote by @xmath54 the topological distance between the @xmath1th node and the first node . by using mathematical induction",
    ", we can prove that there exists a positive constant @xmath55 , such that @xmath56 .",
    "this proposition can be easily transferred to prove the inequality @xmath57 under the condition @xmath58 for @xmath59 . indeed ,",
    "since the network has a tree structure , @xmath54 does not depend on time @xmath16 . under the framework of the mean field theory , the iteration equation for @xmath60 reads @xmath61 with the initial condition @xmath62 .",
    "( 7 ) can be understood as follows : at the @xmath63th time step , the @xmath63th node has probability @xmath64 to connect with the @xmath1th node .",
    "since the average topological distance between the @xmath1th node and the first node is @xmath54 , the topological distance of the @xmath63th node to the first one is @xmath65 if it is connected with the @xmath1th node .",
    "according to the induction assumption , @xmath66 note that , statistically , @xmath67 if @xmath68 , therefore @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the average over all the nodes . substituting inequality ( 9 ) into ( 8) ,",
    "we have @xmath71 rewriting the sum in continuous form , we obtain @xmath72 according to the mathematical induction principle , we have proved that the topological distance between the @xmath1th node and the first node , denoted by @xmath54 , could not exceed the order @xmath73 . for arbitrary nodes @xmath1 and @xmath74 ,",
    "clearly , the topological distance between them could not exceed the sum @xmath75 , thus the average topological distance @xmath76 of the whole network could not exceed the order @xmath73 either .",
    "this topological characteristic is referred to as the small - world effect in network science @xcite , and has been observed in a majority of real networks . actually , one is able to prove that the order of @xmath60 in the large @xmath16 limit is equal to @xmath77 ( see appendix a for details ) .    furthermore , the iteration equation @xmath78 for general functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , has the following solution : @xmath81 for the two special cases of @xmath7 ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath82 , @xmath84 ) , the solutions are simply @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "4 , we report the simulation results about the average distance @xmath87 vs network size @xmath16 . in each case , the data points can be well fitted by a straight line in the semi - log plot , indicating the growth tendency @xmath88 , which agrees well with the analytical solution .

    "all the data are averaged over @xmath90 independent runs , where the maximal network size is @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath53).,title=\"fig : \" ] [ 0.8 ] ( a ) and @xmath24 ( b ) .",

    "( 19 ) .",
    "5 plots the cumulative edge - length distributions . from this figure",
    ", one can see a good agreement between the theoretical and the numerical results .",
    "furthermore , one can calculate the expected value of the @xmath16th edge s geographical length , as @xmath120 which is valid only for sufficiently large @xmath16 and @xmath121 . according to eq .",
    "( 22 ) , @xmath122 decreases as @xmath123 as @xmath16 increases , which is consistent with the intuition since all the @xmath16 nodes are embedded into a 2-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "it may also be interesting to calculate the total length @xmath124 of all the edges at the time step @xmath16 , as @xmath125 @xmath124 is proportional to @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "when @xmath38 , a finite fraction of nodes will be connected with a single hub node and therefore we expect that @xmath128 in this case .",
    "therefore , in the large @xmath16 limit , @xmath124 will increase quite abruptly when the parameter @xmath5 exceeds 1 .",
    "this tendency is indeed observed in our numerical simulations , as shown in fig .",

    "accordingly , the geographical distance between two nodes is defined as the minimal geographical length of all the paths connecting them .",
    "now , we calculate the geographical distance @xmath135 between the @xmath1th node and the first node .",
    "since our network is a tree graph , @xmath135 does not depend on time . by using the mean field theory",
    ", we have @xmath136 or @xmath137 where , according to eq . ( 22 ) , @xmath138    it is not difficult to see that @xmath139 has an upper bound as @xmath16 approaches infinity .",

    "this is because the value of @xmath139 is obtained by the average over infinite configurations for infinite @xmath16 , while in one evolving process @xmath139 is mainly determined by the randomly assigned coordinates of the @xmath16th node .",

    "sharply increases when @xmath5 exceeds the critical value @xmath9 , which well agrees with the theoretical prediction.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in many real - life transportation networks , the geographical effect can not be ignored .",
    "some scientists proposed certain global optimal algorithms to account for the geographical effect on the structure of a static network @xcite . on the other hand , many real networks grow continuously .",
    "therefore , we proposed a growing network model based on an optimal policy involving both topological and geographical measures .",
    "we found that the degree distribution will be broader when the topological ingredient plays a more important role ( i.e. larger @xmath5 ) , and when @xmath5 exceeds a critical value @xmath9 , a finite fraction of nodes will be connected with a single hub node and the geographical effect will become insignificant .",
    "this critical point can also be observed when detecting the total geographical edge - length @xmath124 in the large @xmath16 limit .",
    "we obtained some analytical solutions for degree distribution , edge - length distribution , and topological as well as geographical distances , based on reasonable approximations , which are well verified by simulations .",
    ".empirical degree distributions for geographical transportation networks .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     although the present model is based on some ideal assumptions , it can , at least qualitatively , reproduce some key properties of the real transportation networks . in table 1 , we list some empirical degree distributions of transportation networks .",
    "clearly , when building a new airport , we tend to firstly open some flights connected with previously central airports which are often of very large degrees .",
    "even though the central airports may be far from the new one , to open a direct flight is relatively convenient since one does nt need to build a physical link .",
    "therefore , the geographical effect is very small in the architecture of airport networks , which corresponds to the case of larger @xmath5 that leads to an approximately power - law degree distribution .",
    "for other four cases shown in table 1 , a physical link , which costs much , is necessary if one wants to connect two nodes , thus the geographical effect plays a more important role , which corresponds to the case of smaller @xmath5 that leads to a relatively narrow distribution .",
    "a specific measure of geographical network is its edge - length distribution .",
    "a very recent empirical study @xcite shows that the edge - length distribution of the highly heterogenous networks ( e.g. airport networks , corresponding to the present model with larger @xmath5 ) displays a single - peak function with the maximal edge - length about five times longer than the peaked value ( see fig .",
    "1c of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while in the extreme homogenous networks ( e.g. railway networks , corresponding to the present model with @xmath147 ) , only the very short edge can exist ( see fig .",
    "1a of ref .",
    "these empirical results agree well with the theoretical predictions of the present model .",
    "firstly , when @xmath5 is obviously larger than zero , the edge - length distribution is single - peaked with its maximal edge - length about six times longer than the peak value ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "and , when @xmath5 is close to zero , eq .",
    "( 17 ) degenerates to the form @xmath148 where @xmath96 denotes the network size . clearly , in the large @xmath96 limit , except a very few initially generated edges , only the edge of very small length @xmath97 can exist .",
    "the analytical approach is only valid for the tree structure with @xmath23 .",
    "however , we have checked that all the results will not change qualitatively if @xmath14 is not too large compared with the network size . some analytical methods proposed here are simple but useful , and",
    "may be applied to some other related problems about the statistical properties of complex networks .",
    "for example , a similar ( but much simpler ) approach , taken in section 4 , can also be used to estimate the average topological distance for some other geographical networks @xcite .    finally , it is worthwhile to emphasize that , the geographical effects should also be taken into account when investigating the efficiency ( e.g. the traffic throughput @xcite ) of transportation networks .",
    "very recently , some authors started to consider the geographical effects on dynamical processes , such as epidemic spreading @xcite and cascading @xcite , over scale - free networks .",

    "<S> in this article , we propose a growing network model based on an optimal policy involving both topological and geographical measures . in this model , at each time step , a new node , having randomly assigned coordinates in a @xmath0 square , is added and connected to a previously existing node @xmath1 , which minimizes the quantity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the geographical distance , @xmath4 the degree , and @xmath5 a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the degree distribution obeys a power - law form when @xmath6 , and an exponential form when @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 is in the interval @xmath8 , the network exhibits a stretched exponential distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the average topological distance increases in a logarithmic scale of the network size , indicating the existence of the small - world property . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we obtain the geographical edge - length distribution , the total geographical length of all edges , and the average geographical distance of the whole network . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we found that the total edge - length will sharply increase when @xmath5 exceeds the critical value @xmath9 , and the average geographical distance has an upper bound independent of the network size . </S>",
    "<S> all the results are obtained analytically with some reasonable approximations , which are well verified by simulations . </S>"
