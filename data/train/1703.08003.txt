    "tidal interactions between short - period planets and their host stars are thought to play an important role in the evolution of the planetary orbit as well as the stellar and planetary spins ( e.g.  zahn @xcite ; mathis et al .",
    "@xcite ; ogilvie @xcite ) .",
    "the clearest evidence of tidal evolution in extrasolar planetary systems is the eccentricity distribution of the approximately jupiter - mass planets ( here taken to mean masses @xmath0 ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "planets with @xmath1 d have a wide range of eccentricities , whereas the population with @xmath2 d has much lower eccentricities and displays a strong preference for circular orbits .",
    "tidal dissipation inside the planet ( and perhaps partly also the star ) is thought to be responsible for this dichotomy , since it tends to damp the orbital eccentricities of the shortest - period planets ( it may also have played a role in their formation if they underwent a period of  high eccentricity migration \" to attain such periods e.g. wu & lithwick @xcite ; naoz et al .",
    "@xcite ; anderson et al .",
    "the timescale for this evolution depends on the mechanisms of tidal dissipation , which are only partly understood theoretically .",
    "here , i will focus on nonlinear tidal mechanisms that require finite amplitude tidal deformations .",
    "this is partly because nonlinear effects are the least well understood , but more importantly it is because their consideration is likely to be essential for understanding the tidal evolution of short - period planets .",
    "and @xmath3 d ) .",
    "planets with @xmath1 d have a wide range of eccentricities , whereas the population with @xmath2 d has much lower eccentricities and displays a strong preference for circular orbits .",
    "this provides strong evidence of the important role of tidal dissipation in shaping planetary orbits.,scaledwidth=60.5% ]    the ( dimensionless ) tidal deformations of short - period planets can be estimated by ( the height of the tide is approximately @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the stellar and planetary masses , @xmath8 is the planetary radius , @xmath9 is the orbital semi - major axis , and @xmath10 is the orbital period ( taking @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the right hand side ) .",
    "the most extreme current example is wasp-19 b ( hebb et al .",
    "@xcite ) , with its @xmath14 d orbital period , giving @xmath15 .",
    "this is no longer a small parameter , indicating that nonlinear effects could be important even for large - scale tidal flows in such a body .",
    "this can be compared with the tides in jupiter and saturn due to their most massive satellites ( @xmath16 ) , where nonlinear effects may be much less important for the largest - scale tidal flows ( though they could still be important in damping tidally - excited short - wavelength waves ) .    in this paper , i will discuss two related nonlinear tidal mechanisms : the elliptical instability and the precessional instability .",
    "the former occurs in fluids with elliptical streamlines ( see also the related paper by favier @xcite ) , such as in tidally deformed planets , and the latter occurs in fluid bodies that undergo axial precession , such as planets with misaligned spins and orbits ( nonzero obliquities ) . both are parametric instabilities driven by the periodic time - dependence of fluid properties around a streamline , leading to the excitation of inertial waves ( restored by the coriolis force ) in the planetary interior .",
    "and both mechanisms are likely to be important for tidal evolution of short - period planets .",

    "right : results of local cartesian ( mhd ) and global ellipsoidal ( hydrodynamic ) simulations of the elliptical instability , showing that the turbulent ( volume and time - averaged ) dissipation is consistent with a simple cubic scaling with @xmath17.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the elliptical instability is a fluid instability of elliptical streamlines , such as the large - scale non - wave - like tidal flow in a planet that is non - synchronously rotating or has an eccentric orbit ( see the left panel of fig .  [ ei ] for illustration ) .",
    "the simplest case for illustration is a planet on a circular orbit but that is non - synchronously rotating ( with an aligned or anti - aligned spin axis ) . in the frame rotating at the rate @xmath18 about the spin axis , the elliptical deformation has frequency @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "inertial waves exist with frequencies @xmath21 . if a pair of these waves ( with subscripts 1 & 2 ) has frequencies such that @xmath22 , then the superposition of one of these waves with the deformation can excite the other wave , and vice versa , leading to instability .",
    "consideration of the spatial structure of the waves leads to the additional requirement that the azimuthal wavenumbers and harmonic degrees satisfy @xmath23 ( since the deformation has @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum growth rate ( which typically occurs when @xmath26 ) is ( e.g.  kerswell @xcite ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a dimensionless function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the limit @xmath31",
    ", instability occurs if @xmath32 , but is also possible outside of this range ( particularly for anti - aligned spins with @xmath33 , if @xmath34 is sufficiently large , due to the finite resonant widths e.g.  barker et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the instability leads to turbulence in the planetary interior that produces enhanced tidal dissipation . in hydrodynamical simulations ( barker @xcite ) , the instability generates differential rotation in the planetary interior in the form of zonal flows ( or columnar vortices in a local cartesian model , at least if @xmath35 ; barker & lithwick @xcite ) , which control the saturation of the instability , leading to cyclic , predator - prey - like dynamics ( where zonal flows act as the predator and waves the prey ) with intermittent dissipation .",
    "zonal flows have also been observed in experiments of the elliptical instability ( e.g.  le bars et al .",
    "@xcite ; favier et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the presence of weak magnetic fields ( barker & lithwick @xcite ) , or an alternative frictional mechanism that damps zonal flows ( e.g.  le reun et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the instability leads to sustained turbulence with significantly enhanced dissipation over that of the laminar tidal flow .",
    "the ( volume and time - averaged ) turbulent dissipation rate @xmath36 resulting from sustained instability can be simply estimated .",
    "nonlinearities saturate growth of the unstable waves if @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a typical velocity and @xmath39 is the wavelength of the dominant waves .",
    "kinetic energy is dissipated at the rate @xmath40 , where we have taken @xmath41 for simplicity . for numerically accessible @xmath42 ( including the relevant regime for the shortest - period planets such as wasp-19 b ) , both local and global simulations are consistent with this simple argument , as we show in fig .",
    "we find @xmath43 , where @xmath44 provides an approximate upper bound on @xmath36 ( though @xmath45 does vary to some extent with @xmath29 , as does @xmath46 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this scaling would persist for much smaller @xmath34 , when the instability is more likely to excite very short - wavelength waves ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "also , these arguments neglect the inhibiting effects of zonal flows that lead to intermittent rather than sustained turbulence .",
    "hence , this scaling is best thought of as an approximate upper bound on the dissipation ( due to bulk turbulence ) if we want to extrapolate to smaller @xmath34 .    in the frequency range where the instability operates ,",
    "the resulting turbulent dissipation would drive tidal synchronisation ( and evolution of the planetary spin - orbit angle @xmath48 ) on a timescale @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the planetary rotation period , and circularisation on a timescale @xmath51 where we have taken the planet to have jupiter s mass and radius ( and radius of gyration ) and the star to be sun - like for both estimates ( or constant lag - time ) model . ] ( barker @xcite ) .",
    "hence , this instability could be important for tidal evolution of the shortest - period hot jupiters , and we would predict orbital circularisation for @xmath52 d , and spin synchronisation and alignment for @xmath53 d , due to this mechanism acting in isolation . however , additional mechanisms appear to be required to explain tidal circularisation for @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ evsp ] ) , such as tidal dissipation of linearly - excited inertial waves ( and their linear or nonlinear damping ) in planets with a core ( e.g. ogilvie & lin @xcite ) , or dissipation in the solid core itself ( remus et al .",
    "@xcite ; storch & lai @xcite ) .",
    "the spin axis of a rotationally deformed planet is forced to precess about its orbital angular momentum vector , due to the tidal gravity of its host star , if these directions are misaligned ( if the spin - orbit angle @xmath55 ) .",
    "a typical period of axial precession is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the precession rate ( @xmath58 is a dimensionless version ) , for a jupiter - mass and radius planet orbiting a sun - like star .",
    "this precession is potentially observable for some transiting planets through transit depth variations ( e.g.  carter & winn @xcite ) , which would provide important constraints on the oblateness and interior structure of the planet .",
    "however , axial precession would only occur in single planet systems ( and be potentially observable ) if @xmath48 can remain significantly misaligned .",
    "tidal evolution is expected to ultimately lead to alignment ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "one mechanism that could play a role in driving this tidal evolution is the precessional instability , which will now be introduced .",
    "axial precession induces internal flows inside the planet that are time - periodic , with frequency @xmath60 in the frame rotating with the planet .",
    "pairs of inertial waves can be driven unstable if @xmath61 , and the fastest growing modes typically have @xmath62 , with a maximum growth rate ( kerswell @xcite ) @xmath63    the nonlinear evolution of this instability in a local cartesian model behaves just like the elliptical instability ( barker & lithwick @xcite , barker @xcite ) . for small @xmath58 , the purely hydrodynamical instability generates columnar vortices which inhibit sustained instability and lead to cyclic , predator - prey - like dynamics , with intermittent turbulent dissipation .",
    "the addition of a weak magnetic field eliminates these vortices and leads to sustained turbulence .",
    "global simulations are currently in progress , where we expect the instability to generate zonal flows , and for these to subsequently control the dissipation ( this was demonstrated already in the specific case of an initially anti - aligned spin , once it had evolved away from pure anti - alignment , in barker @xcite , where the elliptical instability was also present ) .    the turbulent dissipation resulting from this instability can be estimated in the same way as for the elliptical instability outlined above .",
    "the local mhd ( and also , approximately , the  bursty \" hydrodynamic ) simulations are consistent with @xmath64 ( with turbulent velocities @xmath65 ) , with @xmath66 , over the range @xmath67 , as we show in fig .",
    "this range is somewhat larger than the realistic values of @xmath58 , requiring us to extrapolate the scaling to probe the astrophysical regime .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this scaling would persist for much smaller @xmath58 , so it is best thought of as an approximate upper bound on the bulk turbulent dissipation when @xmath68 .",
    "the consequences of this turbulent dissipation are tidal evolution of the spin - orbit angle @xmath48 for short - period planets , which evolves due to this mechanism acting in isolation according to ( lai @xcite , ogilvie @xcite ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the ratio of planetary spin to orbital angular momentum and @xmath71 is the timescale for @xmath48 to evolve towards alignment ( @xmath72 ) if @xmath73 is small ( barker @xcite ) , for a jupiter - mass and radius planet around the current sun .",
    "this is also the timescale for @xmath48 to evolve towards anti - alignment ( @xmath74 ) , if @xmath75 is small .",
    "the corresponding timescale if @xmath76 is larger by a factor @xmath77 , indicating that most planets with nearly perpendicular spins will not undergo appreciable evolution by this mechanism acting in isolation .",
    "however , other tidal mechanisms will also contribute , and in general we expect the ultimate tidal evolution to be towards alignment .",
    "nevertheless , this crude estimate suggests that the precessional instability could be important for tidal evolution of the spin - orbit angle for the shortest - period hot ( and warm ) jupiters with @xmath78 d.",
    "i have discussed two related nonlinear mechanisms of tidal dissipation that require finite - amplitude tidal deformations for their operation , which could both be important for the spin - orbit evolution of short - period extrasolar planets .",
    "the elliptical instability occurs in tidally deformed fluid bodies .",
    "local and global simulations suggest that it could drive tidal spin synchronisation ( and spin - orbit alignment ) for hot ( and warm ) jupiters with with @xmath34 that takes into account that @xmath79 when @xmath31 ( barker @xcite ) , which is also consistent with simulations for accessible values of @xmath80 . ]",
    "@xmath81 d , and tidal circularisation for @xmath82 d. other mechanisms are probably required to explain the small eccentricities of planets with @xmath83 , shown in fig .",
    "[ evsp ] .",
    "the precessional instability occurs in axially precessing fluid bodies , such as in rotating planets with spin - orbit misalignments .",
    "simulations using a local model suggest that it can drive tidal evolution of the spin - orbit angle ( towards alignment or anti - alignment , depending on the initial value ) for planets with @xmath84 d ( barker @xcite ) .",
    "global simulations of this instability are currently in progress .    the models that have been adopted so far to study these instabilities are extremely idealised , mainly restricted to homogeneous fluid bodies .",
    "real planets and stars are certainly not homogeneous , but exploring such models constituted a necessary first step .",
    "future work is required to simulate the instability in more realistic planetary models ( i.e.  with a realistic density and entropy stratification ) , including the presence of an inner core ( e.g.  by extending favier et al .",
    "@xcite to adopt more realistic boundary conditions and consider larger tidal amplitudes ) , as well as the influence of magnetic fields in global models .",
    "the effect of zonal flows on the saturation of these instabilities in the astrophysically relevant regime of small deformations ( or precession rates ) , as well as vanishingly small viscosities should be considered , as should the coexistence of both types of instability , and these instabilities with turbulent convection .",
