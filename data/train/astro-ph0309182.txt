    "the observed fluxes of highly relativistic jets such as those found in active galactic nuclei and gamma - ray bursts are subject to strong relativistic aberration and doppler beaming effects .",
    "this poses a serious challenge for determining the intrinsic luminosity functions ( lfs ) of these objects .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have discussed in detail how luminosity functions can be apparently altered by doppler beaming , but present analytical expressions only for cases where every jet in the population has the same intrinsic jet speed . in their analysis of beamed luminosity functions , @xcite found evidence that bl lac objects could be the beamed counterparts of fr - i galaxies , provided that they have a wide distribution of jet lorentz factors .",
    "large proper motion surveys @xcite have also revealed that the overall agn population contains a wide range of apparent jet speeds , which is inconsistent with a single - valued intrinsic speed distribution @xcite .    here",
    "we extend the earlier work of @xcite by deriving full analytical expressions for the doppler factor distributions and beamed luminosity functions of randomly - oriented , two - sided jet populations that contain a range of jet speed @xmath0 .",
    "we use an improved method that involves first deriving the predicted doppler factor distribution , and then integrating over an appropriate range of doppler factor to obtain the apparent luminosity function .",
    "we show how this method results in a much wider number of scenarios that can be treated fully analytically .    for simplicity , we consider only straight jets , where the emission is beamed proportionally according to the lorentz factor of the jet flow ( defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of light ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to cases where the jet lorentz factors are distributed according to a power law , since this distribution provides the best fit to the apparent speed distribution of agn jets @xcite .",
    "other forms , such as gaussian and single - valued functions , provide very poor fits to the observed speeds .    in   [ dopplersec ]",
    "we outline our model assumptions and derive the predicted doppler factor distributions for lorentz factor distributions of the form @xmath3 .",
    "we use these results in   [ beamedlfsec ] to examine how a simple intrinsic power - law luminosity function @xmath4 is transformed by doppler boosting into its observed form @xmath5 . in   [ obsconseq ] we discuss how our results can be applied to recover useful information about the parent population of samples dominated by relativistic jet emission , such as gamma - ray bursts , gamma - ray loud agn , and core - dominated , radio - loud agn .",
    "we summarize our findings in ",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "for the purposes of obtaining analytical expressions , we adopt a simple model in which each source in the population contains two identical , straight , oppositely - directed jets with bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the jet axes are randomly oriented , so that if @xmath7 represents the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight , then @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the probability density function of the viewing angles .",
    "the lorentz factors have a density function @xmath11 that is positive and non - zero over the region @xmath12 .",
    "the kinematic doppler factor is defined as = ^-1 , and represents the frequency shift between the observer and jet rest frames .",
    "the minimum possible doppler factor is @xmath13 , and occurs when @xmath14 .",
    "the maximum possible doppler factor in the population is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and occurs when @xmath17 .",

    "a we derive the expected doppler factor distributions of randomly - oriented jet populations having various lorentz factor distributions .",
    "we plot some individual cases corresponding to single - valued and power - law distributions in figure  [ fi1 ] .",
    "the two thick lines in figure  [ fi1 ] represent populations where all jets have the same intrinsic lorentz factor @xmath20 , with the dotted - dashed line corresponding to @xmath21 , and the solid line corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "the latter represents the fastest jet speed typically seen in large agn proper - motion surveys ( kellermann et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . for a single - valued lorentz factor distribution , @xmath23 , which corresponds to a straight line with slope of @xmath24 in our log - log plot ( fig .  [ fi1 ] )",
    "the thin curves in figure  [ fi1 ] correspond to various jet populations with lorentz factors distributed between @xmath25 .",
    "the thin dotted - dashed line shows the expected doppler factor distribution for a jet population with an inverted @xmath6 distribution ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the thin dashed curve represents a uniform @xmath6 distribution ( @xmath27 constant ) .",
    "these two curves have an overall slope that is roughly the same as in the single - valued case ( slope = @xmath24 ) over a wide range of @xmath28 , but they both taper off sharply near @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "jets with these extreme doppler factors all have lorentz factors @xmath31 , and viewing angles close to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "they are therefore very rare in the population . in the case of models where @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the tapering off at the extrema is a result of having relatively fewer jets with @xmath36 , as compared to a single - valued population where all the jets have the same jet speed .",
    "the remaining two curves in figure  [ fi1 ] represent the cases @xmath37 ( thin solid line ) and @xmath38 ( thin dotted line ) . in populations such as these which have few high - speed jets",
    ", the distributions taper off much more sharply for doppler factors above @xmath39 .",
    "the slopes of the @xmath40 functions have a discontinuity at @xmath41 , which arises because , if @xmath42 , potentially any jet in the population can have a doppler factor in the range @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a slight over - density of sources in this interval .",
    "for a jet to have a doppler factor that lies outside this range , it must have a speed greater than ( but not equal to ) @xmath44 .",
    "we have shown that the power - law slope of the lorentz factor distribution can have a strong influence on the distribution of doppler factors in a randomly - oriented jet population . in figure  [ fi2 ]",
    "we show the effects of increasing the lower limit of the lorentz factor distribution on a population with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "as @xmath47 is increased , the region @xmath43 grows wider , and the cusp at @xmath41 is replaced by a broad region with slope equal to @xmath24 .",
    "the same behavior also occurs for other values of @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fi2 ] also confirms that the doppler factor distribution approaches that of the single - valued lorentz factor case as @xmath49 .",
    "it is important to note that in a sample of purely randomly - oriented two - sided jets , exactly half will have approaching jet viewing angles greater than @xmath50 .",
    "this means that regardless of the form of the jet lorentz factor distribution , there will always be a preponderance of sources with low doppler factors , such that the mean value of @xmath28 will always be less than unity .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , if a jet population is measured to have a high mean doppler factor , this actually implies that it must be dominated by _",
    "slow _ jets .",
    "we caution , however , that this reasoning only applies to genuinely orientation - unbiased samples .",
    "flux - limited samples selected on the basis of relativistically - beamed jet emission , on the other hand , will be strongly biased toward small viewing angles , and as a result will always be dominated by intrinsically fast jets with high doppler factors ( i.e. , blazars ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we now use our results on the predicted doppler factor distributions to derive the corresponding apparent luminosity functions of relativistically beamed jet populations . for the purposes of obtaining analytical expressions",
    ", we will ignore any luminosity contribution from the jet in each source that is pointing away from the observer . in ",
    "[ twosidedsec ] we will show using numerical simulations that for a steep intrinsic lf , the receding ( counter - jet ) luminosity only affects the shape of the faint end of the beamed lf , and has no effect at high observed luminosities .    due to relativistic aberration , the luminosity of an isotropically - emitting , moving object according to a stationary observer is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the source rest - frame luminosity , @xmath53 for continuous jet emission , and @xmath54 is the spectral index ( @xmath55 ) . in the case of a discrete emitting region , we have @xmath56 due to relativistic time dilation of its finite synchrotron - emitting lifetime @xcite . for fixed @xmath57 ,",
    "the observed luminosity function of a population of relativistic jets will depend solely on its doppler factor distribution and its intrinsic ( unbeamed ) luminosity function . in the figures that follow , we will only plot models with @xmath58 , which is appropriate for the continuous jet emission associated with the flat - spectrum cores of blazars .",
    "we begin by assuming that the jet population has an intrinsic power - law luminosity function of the form : @xmath59 where the normalization constant is @xmath60 the transformation law for probability density functions yields the joint probability function @xmath61 using equations ( [ beameq ] ) and ( [ hprob ] ) and the intrinsic luminosity function , we obtain @xmath62 integrating over @xmath28 gives @xmath63 where ( using the notation of @xcite ) c = b - ( 1/p ) -1 .",
    "[ cdef ]    in their derivation of the beamed lf for a jet population having a unique lorentz factor , @xcite identified several important values of l. here we keep their definitions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and extend their notation as follows : @xmath66    we note that a similar extension of notation was made by @xcite , however , they do not include the parameter @xmath67 , which is needed for the analytical solutions presented in appendix b.    when @xmath18 is large , the beamed lf spans a wide range : l_max / l_min = _ 2 ^ 2p(1+_2)^p ( _ 2/_1 ) . thus , even a jet population with a single intrinsic luminosity @xmath68 will end up with a broad beamed luminosity function .",
    "this scenario has been invoked to explain the wide range of observed luminosities in gamma - ray bursts , which are thought to have lorentz factors on the order of 100 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to determine an analytical expression for the beamed lf , we substitute the relevant expression for @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "[ unifpdelta ] ) into equation ( [ phil ] ) and integrate over appropriate limits .",
    "we find that analytical solutions are generally only possible when the product @xmath69 is an integer .",
    "we derive expressions for several cases in appendix b.  for simplicity , we have considered only cases where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this corresponds to the condition @xmath72 , which will always be satisfied provided @xmath73 is made arbitrarily large .",
    "the latter can be justified if , as in our case , the intrinsic lf slope is fairly steep ( i.e. , @xmath74 for @xmath58 ) . with these choices of parameters ,",
    "the @xmath75 values in equation  ( [ ldefs ] ) are arranged in order of increasing apparent luminosity .    in figure  [ fi3 ]",
    "we plot @xmath76}$ ] versus @xmath77}$ ] for various power - law lorentz factor distributions distributed over the range @xmath78 .",
    "the thick solid curve is the original ( unbeamed ) lf , which in this example has a power - law slope equal to @xmath24 and @xmath79 } = 7 $ ] .",
    "the remaining curves represent the beamed lfs for various values of power - law index @xmath48 , where @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite found that for a single - valued lorentz factor distribution , the beamed luminosity function will have the same slope as the unbeamed one for @xmath80 , except in the immediate vicinity of @xmath81 . in their numerical analysis , @xcite claimed that this also holds true for a distribution of lorentz factors . we confirm this in the case of flat or inverted lorentz factor distributions ( i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "indeed , the beamed lfs of a single - valued model with @xmath84 and a uniformly distributed model ( @xmath85 ) are nearly identical for @xmath80 ( see fig .  [ fi4 ] ) .    for steep power - law @xmath6 distributions with @xmath86 ,",
    "the beamed and unbeamed lfs also have the same slope , however , this is true only for the region @xmath87 . above @xmath88 ,",
    "the slope steepens by an amount proportional to the power - law @xmath6 index @xmath48 .",
    "we note that in the case of a jet population where @xmath89 is large and the intrinsic lf is steep , objects with @xmath90 will be extremely rare . in the models shown in figure 3",
    ", only one jet in @xmath91 will have @xmath90 .    at luminosities fainter than @xmath65",
    ", @xcite claimed that the slope will always be equal to @xmath92 , regardless of the lorentz factor distribution .",
    "however , we find this is true only in cases where there are very few low - lorentz factor jets in the population ( i.e. , when @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) . in cases where @xmath95 and the lorentz factor distribution is steep , the lf slope at low luminosities is significantly flatter than @xmath92 , and can even be highly inverted ( see fig  [ fi3 ] ) .",
    "we caution , however , that at these low - luminosities many jets will lie in the plane of the sky , and that our analytical expressions ignore the receding jet . adding",
    "the counterjet s contribution to the total emission will change the predicted luminosity functions slightly .",
    "we discuss this issue in more detail in the next section .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of various ranges of lorentz factor on the apparent luminosity functions of jet populations . in figure  [ fi5 ]",
    "we plot three different models with lorentz factors uniformly distributed over different ranges @xmath45 .",
    "it is apparent that for @xmath80 , the bright end of the beamed lf is largely insensitive to the values of @xmath47 and @xmath18 .",
    "increasing @xmath18 can potentially increase the number of ultra - high luminosity objects , but again these are likely to be extremely rare for steep intrinsic lfs .    at faint luminosities ,",
    "the beamed lf is highly sensitive to the value of @xmath18 , since this dictates the minimum doppler factor , and hence @xmath96 . because a very fast jet population will have a low mean doppler factor ( see   [ deltadiscussion ] ) , its sources will , on average , appear _ fainter _ than those of a population dominated by slow speeds .",
    "again , this reasoning applies only to genuinely orientation - unbiased samples .",
    "the beamed luminosity functions presented in the previous section are not strictly correct at low luminosities , since they ignore any luminosity contribution from the receding jet in each source .",
    "when considering only highly beamed objects such as blazars or gamma - ray bursts , this is a reasonable approximation , since the receding jet will be extremely faint ( and usually undetectable ) .",
    "however , in samples containing mildly relativistic jets , or jets that lie close to the plane of the sky ( e.g. , lobe - dominated radio galaxies ) , both the approaching and receding jets can contribute roughly equal amounts of flux .",
    "in figure  [ fi6 ] we compare two models with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "the solid line shows the beamed luminosity function if only the luminosity of the approaching jet is considered .",
    "the dashed line represents a numerically - determined beamed lf in which the luminosities of both the approaching and receding jets are taken into account . for luminosities below @xmath101 , the curves differ considerably , since these jets lie close to the plane of the sky . at higher luminosities ,",
    "the predicted lfs are virtually identical , since the apparent approaching / receding jet luminosity ratio becomes very large for small viewing angles and high lorentz factors .",
    "we find that this result holds true for all ranges of @xmath102 and @xmath48 discussed in this paper .",
    "we conclude therefore , that the emission from the receding jet can be safely ignored when studying the luminosity functions of highly beamed objects .",
    "the analytical results derived in this paper are applicable to any astronomical sample that is selected solely on the basis of relativistically - beamed jet emission .",
    "our results are particularly relevant to compact radio - loud agn , whose high - frequency radio emission originates primarily from milliarcsecond - scale relativistic jets . with the advent of dedicated vlbi arrays ,",
    "it is now possible to conduct large multi - epoch surveys of these objects ( e.g. , the caltech - jodrell surveys ; @xcite and the vlba 2 cm survey ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , because of the high thresholds required for fringe detection , these large vlbi studies have so far been confined to the brightest , most compact objects whose radiation is highly beamed toward us .",
    "these types of samples are not ideal for studying the general properties of the agn jets , since one must first disentangle the combined effects of beaming , jet axis orientation bias , and malmquist bias before one can construct a luminosity function or intrinsic speed distribution .",
    "monte carlo simulations have played an important role in this respect .",
    "@xcite showed that based on their observed superluminal speed distribution , agn jets must have a wide range of lorentz factors distributed according to a relatively steep power law ( @xmath3 , where @xmath103 ) .",
    "they also demonstrated that a reasonably large , flux - limited sample of bright jets should always contain some objects with apparent speed equal to the maximum jet lorentz factor in the parent population .    since the observed lf of radio - loud agn is fairly steep @xmath104 ;",
    "@xcite ) , our findings suggest that the observed lf of a complete flux - limited sample selected on the basis of beamed emission will closely match the intrinsic lf for luminosities in the range @xmath105 . here",
    "we have assumed a boost index @xmath58 and @xmath18 equal to the maximum apparent speed @xmath106 .",
    "the lower luminosity limit @xmath107 can be constrained using the nearest sources in a complete vlbi flux - limited sample , since these will generally meet the flux density criteria on the basis of their cosmological proximity , and not their doppler boosting factors .",
    "the upper luminosity limit @xmath73 can be constrained using the observed space density of radio - loud agn .",
    "we are currently gathering vlbi proper motion and flux density data at 15 ghz on a sample of the brightest @xmath108 jets in the northern sky .",
    "this sample , entitled mojave ( monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments ; @xcite ) , is complete on the basis of compact ( vlbi ) flux density , and is therefore well - suited for exploring the intrinsic luminosity function of agn jets .",
    "an analysis of the mojave data is currently underway , and the results will be discussed in an upcoming paper .",
    "astronomical samples of objects selected on the basis of emission from relativistic jets , such as gamma - ray bursters , gamma - ray loud agn , and compact radio - loud agn , will by highly affected by relativistic beaming effects . in particular , their observed luminosities are predicted to be enhanced by a factor @xmath109 , where @xmath28 is the doppler factor .",
    "we have derived expressions for the predicted doppler factor distributions of two - sided , randomly - oriented , straight jet populations whose bulk lorentz factors are distributed in the range @xmath110 $ ] according to a simple power - law @xmath34 .",
    "we summarize our findings as follows :    * the minimum and maximum jet doppler factor in the population will depend only on the maximum lorentz factor @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , @xmath13 , and @xmath111 . * an orientation - unbiased sample of jets will always have a mean doppler factor less than unity , since the majority of jets will lie close to the plane of the sky .",
    "accordingly , a jet population weighted toward very fast speeds will have a lower mean doppler factor , and therefore appear fainter than an identical jet population with slower intrinsic jet speeds .",
    "* a randomly - oriented jet population with a flat ( @xmath82 ) or inverted ( @xmath83 ) lorentz factor distribution will have a doppler factor distribution very similar to a population where all jets have @xmath112 . over a broad range of @xmath28 ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath40 will vary as @xmath113 , except near @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where much fewer sources are expected compared to the single - valued case .",
    "sources with the highest possible doppler factors near @xmath30 will always be rare , even when all the jets in the population are highly relativistic ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the extremely small angles to the line of sight that are necessary for high doppler factors .",
    "we have also derived analytical expressions for the apparent luminosity functions ( lfs ) of relativistic jet populations having a power - law distribution of lorentz factors and a steep intrinsic power - law luminosity function .",
    "we find that :    * the slope of the apparent lf at low luminosities is not always equal @xmath92 , as claimed by @xcite .",
    "the apparent lf in this region is highly sensitive to the speed distribution of the parent population .",
    "in particular , if the parent population is dominated by slow jets , the lf slope will be very flat or inverted at low luminosities . *",
    "regardless of the values of @xmath47 and @xmath18 , when the lorentz factor distribution of the jet population is steep ( i.e. , @xmath114 , where @xmath3 ) , the intrinsic and beamed lfs will have the same slope over the range @xmath115 , where @xmath75 is the observed luminosity and @xmath107 and @xmath73 are the lower and upper cutoffs on the intrinsic lf , respectively .",
    "* since the intrinsic lf of radio - loud agn jets is known to be steep , it should be possible to investigate its properties using flux - limited vlbi samples of highly beamed agn jets .",
    "such samples will have to be selected at relatively high radio frequencies ( e.g. above @xmath116 ghz ) in order to eliminate any contribution from un - beamed , steep - spectrum emission .",
    "an analysis of such a sample selected at 15 ghz ( mojave ) is underway , and will be presented in an upcoming paper .",
    "the author wishes to thank ken kellermann , marshall cohen , tigran arshakian , and rene vermeulen for helpful comments on this manuscript .",
    "we wish to determine the probability density function @xmath117 , which describes the expected distribution of doppler factors for a randomly - oriented , two - sided jet population .",
    "the theory of probability transformation for several variables implies @xmath118 now @xmath119 since the viewing angles are distributed according to @xmath120 we have @xmath121 we integrate over @xmath6 to obtain the probability density function for @xmath28 : @xmath122 where the limits on this integral are illustrated graphically in figure  [ fi7 ] .",
    "the lower limit depends on the value of @xmath28 as follows : @xmath123 where we have used the fact that @xmath124 and @xmath111 .",

    "<S> in particular , the beamed and intrinsic luminosity functions will have the same slope at high luminosities . in the case of a steeply declining lorentz factor distribution </S>",
    "<S> , the slopes at high luminosities will also be identical , but only up to an apparent luminosity equivalent to the upper cutoff of the intrinsic luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> also , at very high apparent luminosities , the slope will be proportional to the power law slope of the lorentz factor distribution . </S>",
    "<S> at very low luminosities , the form of the apparent luminosity function is very sensitive to the lower cutoff and steepness of the lorentz factor distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how it should be possible to recover useful information about the intrinsic luminosity functions of relativistic jets by studying flux - limited samples selected on the basis of beamed jet emission . </S>"
