    "conformal gravity is a kind of higher curvature gravity which is invariant under conformal transformations . in the simplest form in four spacetime dimensions ,",
    "its action is consisted of the square of weyl curvature tensor .",
    "because of the conformal invariance , this model is only sensitive to angles but not to distances .",
    "this feels counter intuition since everyone knows that gravity should decrease as the distance increases . on the level of linear perturbations ,",
    "conformal gravity suffers from the existence of ghost degrees of freedom , which implies vacuum instability . for these reasons , conformal gravity",
    "may well be thought of as an unphysical model of gravity .",
    "however , as maldacena pointed out @xcite , the on - shell action of conformal gravity is identical to that of einstein gravity in an ( a)ds background , and under proper boundary conditions ( neumann boundary conditions ) , the contribution from the ghost degrees of freedom can be removed .",
    "conversely , the boundary anomaly of five dimensional einstein gravity yields the action of four dimensional conformal gravity @xcite , and also , the four dimensional einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant regularized with a topological gauss - bonnet term can be reduced on - shell to that of the conformal gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to take conformal gravity more seriously than just another toy model of gravity .",
    "maldacena s arguments on the equivalence between conformal gravity and einstein gravity are subjects to several limitations .",
    "it works only in the classical ( or tree - level ) regime , only for backgrounds which are einstein manifolds obeying the neumann boundary conditions and only in the vacuum sector .",
    "when any of these limitations is broken , it is unclear whether we can still treat conformal gravity as an equivalent model of einstein gravity .",
    "take the matter contribution for instance .",
    "when matter sources are present , it is not clear _ a priori _ whether einstein manifolds are solutions to the model and whether the boundary conditions proposed by maldacena can still be applied . for generic matter sources ,",
    "the answer to these problems might be `` no '' , because the boundary conditions actually played an important role in breaking the conformal invariance in some way , but the matter source may have already broken the conformal invariance which leaves no room for breaking the conformal invariance in other ways .",
    "but there is an interesting class of matter sources , i.e. conformally coupled matter sources , which keeps the conformal invariance of the model .",
    "conformal gravity with conformally coupled matter sources might still provide room for arguments which are analogous to what maldacena has made in the vacuum sector .",
    "however , an obvious obstacle will emerge when one tries to mimic maldacena s arguments in the cases with conformally coupled sources , i.e. sufficient message on the solutions to such cases is a necessary input . unlike the case of vacuum conformal gravity",
    "which is studied extensively in the literature ( and it is known that any spacetime that is conformal to an einstein manifold is a solution @xcite ) , known solutions to conformal gravity with conformally coupled sources are relatively rare .",
    "an outstanding exception is conformal gravity with minimally coupled electromagnetic field . for this particular type of conformal invariant matter source , a number of exact solutions with different symmetries",
    "have been found @xcite .",
    "an extension to the case with an additional su(2 ) yang - mills source has also been found to possess exact ads black hole solutions @xcite . besides these particular cases ,",
    "no other solutions to conformal gravity with conformally coupled matter sources have been known , at least to our knowledge .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to present exact solutions to conformal gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field ( cgccs model for short ) .",
    "the type of solution which we will present is quite similar to the c - metric which has been known for a long time @xcite in the context of pure einstein gravity .",
    "the reason that we pay our attention to the c - metric - like solutions is because such solutions capture almost every aspects of classical relativistic spacetimes and therefore can be used as a nontrivial theoretical laboratory for studying relativistic spacetimes . for instance , they contain black holes  actually two black holes accelerating apart  and hence also acceleration horizons @xcite .",
    "they can be easily generalized to bear cosmological constants @xcite and/or electromagnetic charge @xcite . for einstein gravity",
    "conformally coupled with a scalar field , the c - metric solution was also found @xcite .",
    "the rotating form of the c - metric is known as plebanski - demianski metric @xcite .",
    "finally , the black ring solution @xcite which appears in five dimensional einstein gravity contains a wick - rotated version of the c - metric as a building block .",
    "we hope that the rich structure of the c - metric may also be useful in exploring the possible connections between conformal gravity and einstein gravity , or in revealing the differences of conformal gravity from einstein gravity . as a note in passing ,",
    "let us remark that , even in the vacuum sector , the c - metric solution in conformal gravity has not been explored ( though expected to exist ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the situations of non - accelerating black hole solutions which have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ] ,",
    "we give the action , field equations and the c - metric solution of of the cgccs model .",
    "it is shown that the metric we get represents a spacetime which has a non - constant scalar curvature , but is of petrov class d , just like the standard c - metric in einstein gravity .",
    "then , in section [ sec3 ] , we study coordinate ranges and horizon structures of the solution , with emphasis on the determination of the boundaries of the physically interesting static regions ( by which we mean the static region outside a black hole event horizon ) .",
    "this section is subdivided into three subsections according to the different values of the scalar self - coupling @xmath0 and another parameter @xmath1 entering the explicit solution of the scalar field . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we consider two other conformal gauges and show that the solution we get is conformal to the standard ads c - metric appeared in vacuum einstein gravity .",
    "finally , in section section4 , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "up to a boundary counter term which is irrelevant to our study in this paper , the action of the cgccs model that we shall study is given as follows : @xmath2\\label{action},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the weyl tensor and ricci scalar associated with the spacetime metric @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "note that the coefficient in front of the @xmath7 term is fixed by the requirement of conformal invariance under the transformations @xmath8 so , there can be no other free parameters in the model .",
    "note also that , by a field redefinition @xmath9 together with a rescaling of parameter @xmath10 , the parameter @xmath6 becomes an overall factor in the action so that it plays no role on the classical level .",
    "therefore , we can set @xmath11 without loss of generality . in order that the scalar self - interacting potential to be bounded from below , it is necessary to require @xmath12 .",
    "the field equations that follow from variations with respect to the metric @xmath5 and to the scalar field @xmath13 are given respectively as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bach tensor and @xmath16 is the stress - energy tensor for the scalar field @xmath13 .    in the spacetime",
    "coordinates @xmath17 , we take the metric ansatz @xmath18 and meanwhile assume the scalar field to take the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 are all constants .    by brute force using _ maple _ , we arrive at the following solution : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are integration constants .",
    "not all of these constants are necessarily important .",
    "we can make use of the coordinate transformations to fix some of these constants and reduce the solution to a simpler form . to be more specific",
    ", we can use the following 3-parameter coordinate transformations @xmath23 to fix or constrain three of the four integration constants @xmath24 at the sacrifice of a rescaling of the constant @xmath25 and a shift and rescaling of the constant @xmath1 .",
    "the constant @xmath26 is not affected by such operations . in the following",
    ", we shall take the liberty of the above coordinate degrees of freedom to set the integration constants @xmath24 to the specific values @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the only residual free integration constant .",
    "notice that we still denote the rescaled constant @xmath25 and the shift - rescaled @xmath1 by the same symbols . under the above choice of integration constants , the metric functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be arranged in the form @xmath31[1+(e_2-y)][1 + 2ma(e_2-y)]+\\frac{2e_1 ^ 2\\lambda}{a^2}. \\label{fy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to observe that @xmath32    the metric with @xmath29 and @xmath30 given respectively by and looks extremely similar to the c - metric solution of vacuum einstein gravity , therefore we call this solution the c - metric solution for the cgccs model . however , there are some significant differences from the standard c - metric in einstein gravity . among these ,",
    "let us point out two major differences :    * unlike the vacuum c - metric in einstein gravity , our solution is sourced , sensitive to the scalar field ( which can be seen from the appearance of the constants @xmath33 and @xmath0 in and ) ; * our solution is not a constant curvature spacetime . by straightforward calculations and some elementary algebraic manipulations ,",
    "the ricci scalar of our solution can be written in the following form : @xmath34 \\big\\}. % \\label{sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , it will be interesting to ask whether our solution is conformal to an einstein manifold .",
    "we postpone the answer of this question to section [ sec4 ] .    in spite of the differences mentioned above",
    ", there is a crucial similarity between our solution and the standard c - metric . examining the weyl curvature of our solution",
    ", we find that the only nonvanishing projection of the weyl curvature of our spacetime on the newman - penrose null tetrads is @xmath35 therefore , our solution is of petrov type d , just like the standard c - metric in vacuum einstein gravity .",
    "in this section , we would like to analyze some aspects of the structure of the spacetime solution given by eqs . , and .",
    "we will be particularly interested in the understandings about the ranges of the coordinates , the horizon structures and the interpretation of the constant parameters .",
    "essentially we will be following the lines of @xcite and that of @xcite .    according to",
    ", the root structure of the function @xmath30 is different for the cases @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the former case ,",
    "the function @xmath30 is already factorized , from which we can read off explicitly the three roots , which are all independent of the constant @xmath26 . in the latter case , however , the function @xmath30 is not factorized , and it is more difficult to find its root structure .",
    "so , we will proceed differently for these two cases .      when @xmath36 , @xmath30 is explicitly factorized , so it is easy get the roots of @xmath30 : @xmath38 here we have introduced the shorthand notation @xmath39 because this expression will appear repeatedly in the forth coming discussions . to fix the order of the three roots , we assume @xmath40 which can always be achieved using the transformations given in . under this assumption , we have @xmath41 regardless of what value the constant @xmath1 takes ( provided it is real ) .    the metric depends explicitly only on two of the four spacetime coordinates @xmath42 .",
    "therefore let us first try to determine the physical regions for these two coordinates .",
    "recall that the correct lorentz signature of the metric requires @xmath43 .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath44 or reparameterized as @xmath45 on the other hand , the existence of a static region in the spacetime requires @xmath46 . rewriting @xmath30 as @xmath47",
    "it is clear that the condition @xmath46 requires either @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "it will become clear shortly that the third root @xmath50 of @xmath30 corresponds to a black hole event horizon .",
    "therefore , the first region @xmath48 is physically relatively less interesting because the black hole horizon is out of reach from this region .",
    "the second region @xmath49 is more interesting following the same consideration .",
    "so , for now , let us assume that @xmath51 takes values in the second region .",
    "finally , due to the overall conformal factor , we know that @xmath52 is the conformal infinity of our spacetime , thus the physical region of the spacetime requires either @xmath53 or @xmath54 but not across @xmath55 . in the following",
    ", we shall be concentrating exclusively on the physically interesting region @xmath53 . depending on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath56 , the static region of the spacetime",

    "first of all , following the discussions made in the last two sections , it seems that the c - metric solution with @xmath30 and @xmath29 given in , does not asymptote to an ( a)ds spacetime , therefore , it is not clear how to implement maldacena s neumann boundary condition , or whether such a boundary condition can be implemented in principle in our case . under such circumstances",
    ", we have no other choices but considering all @xmath205 on equal footing",
    ". however , writing down the explicit form of the metric implies a concrete , fixed choice for @xmath205 , i.e. we have to work in concrete conformal gauges .",
    "in fact , since the hawking temperature of a black hole depends only on the explicit form of the metric but not on the action of the gravity model , any explicit form of the metric of a black hole spacetime implies a definite hawking temperature and hence a prescribed energy scale , which signifies the breaking of conformal symmetry .",
    "this is the situation for all black hole solutions to conformal gravity .    unlike the usual gauge symmetries in quantum field theories",
    "in which the gauge choice is irrelevant to the physics , different choices of conformal gauges corresponds to different physics ( or physics at different scales ) . among the infinite many choices of conformal gauges , we are particularly interested in two other gauge choices , which are closely related to the answer of the following two questions :    q1 .",
    "is our solution contained in the conformal class of an einstein manifold ?",
    "what are the major differences between all the different conformal gauges ?",
    "the answer to q1 is simply `` yes '' . to see this",
    ", we would like to make a conformal transformation , bringing the original metric into another conformal gauge , in which the metric becomes that of a constant curvature spacetime . concretely ,",
    "we choose the following weyl factor @xmath205 , @xmath206 then , after performing the conformal transformation , the metric becomes @xmath207 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are still given by and . on this occasion",
    "it is tempting to make a shift of coordinate @xmath208 , after which the metric becomes @xmath209 where @xmath210 is given by @xmath211 the metric is precisely the ads c - metric with the cosmological constant @xmath212 which appeared first in @xcite and was analyzed in detail in @xcite in the context of standard einstein gravity .",
    "now we recovered the same metric in conformal gravity .",
    "the first few curvature invariants of the spacetime are @xmath213 the only curvature singularity is located at @xmath214 .",
    "notice that the constant @xmath1 disappeared completely in the metric . as a sharp comparison ,",
    "we have seen enough on the importance of the constant @xmath1 while exploring the structure of the spacetime in the original gauge in the last section .",
    "notice also that after making the conformal transformation using the weyl factor , the scalar field @xmath13 in becomes a constant , @xmath215 therefore , the on - shell kinetic energy of the scalar field is zero and the on - shell scalar potential becomes an effective cosmological constant . in this case , the on - shell action of the model under investigation becomes that of the einstein - weyl gravity ( i.e. @xmath216 gravity ) with a cosmological constant .",
    "last but not the least , let us remark that the metric looks extremely similar to the @xmath79 case of the original metric , however with a big difference in the position of conformal infinity . for , the conformal infinity lies at @xmath55 , while for , the conformal infinity lies at @xmath217 .",
    "so , if one intends to depict the static region of the spacetime , she / he would have ended in a diagram like fig.[fig2]@xmath186 , but with the direction of the line representing conformal infinity changed from sw - ne to nw - se .",
    "another conformal gauge which we would like to mention is the gauge @xmath218 which can be arrived in from via the transformations @xmath219 after which the scalar field takes the value @xmath220 notice that unlike the other two conformal gauges discussed previously , the conformal infinity in the present case appear at @xmath221 .",
    "this makes the coordinate @xmath51 to be reminiscent to the famous poincare coordinate for ads spacetime .",
    "however , the metric is not ads , and is not even a constant curvature spacetime , as can be easily seen from the ricci scalar @xmath222 -e_2 y+e_2 ^ 2 - 1\\right\\ } -24e_2 ^ 2\\lambda.\\ ] ] the curvature singularities appear at @xmath223 . due to the appearance of the conformal infinity , we must take either @xmath224 or @xmath225 when considering the structure of the spacetime .",
    "we take the former choice @xmath224 .    assuming that the ratio of parameters @xmath128 is taking values in the appropriate range , we can rewrite @xmath30 in a completely factorized form @xmath226 where @xmath227 are real numbers which are determined implicitly by the original parameters @xmath228 . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume the three roots @xmath229 is ordered as @xmath230 then the correct lorentz signature of the metric requires @xmath72 and @xmath231 .",
    "it can be verified using the same arguments that have led to that the roots @xmath232 and @xmath233 are exactly where the proper acceleration of static observers tends to diverge . with a little bit more efforts we can identify that @xmath233 is the black hole event horizon and @xmath232 is a pure acceleration horizon , provided that these roots are accessible from the physically interesting static region of the spacetime .",
    "depending on the signatures of @xmath234 and @xmath235 , there are three possibilities which are depicted in fig.[fig8 ] . in fig.[fig8]@xmath186 , the physically interesting region ( shaded in darkgrey )",
    "is bounded by @xmath57 , a black hole event horizon at @xmath233 and an acceleration horizon at @xmath232 .",
    "the conformal infinity @xmath221 lies behind the acceleration horizon and hence is out of reach from the static region .",
    "the case of fig.[fig8]@xmath188 is different in that the conformal infinity appears first and so the acceleration horizon is beyond reach from the static region .",

    "however this is only superficial .",
    "actually , still corresponds to an accelerating black hole spacetime , if the parameters are taken in the appropriate ranges . as a consequence",
    ", it can be static but not spherically symmetric unless @xmath244 .    now reviewing the three different conformal gauges we have discussed so far , we come to the following conclusion , which is also part of the answer to q2 , i.e. the location of the conformal infinities are significantly affected by the choice of conformal gauges .",
    "this is one of the major differences between different choices of conformal gauges .",
    "we have thus presented an exact c - metric solution to the cgccs model , in which the scalar field played as a nontrivial matter source .",
    "when the parameters are in the appropriate ranges , the solution may contain a black hole event horizon and an acceleration horizon and both horizons may be cut by the conformal infinity or be hidden behind the conformal infinity .",
    "the solution belongs to the class of petrov type d spacetimes and is conformal to the standard cosmological c - metric known in vacuum einstein gravity .    for all parameter ranges we studied in detail the physically interesting static regions as depicted in figs.[fig1]-[fig8 ] except fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "however these figures do not exhaust all possible static regions .",
    "there are other static regions like the ones shaded in lightgrey in the above mentioned figures in which are not not of major concern in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "there are also some potentially interesting regions which are also static , e.g. the triangular region @xmath245 in fig.[fig1]@xmath186 , and similarly the triangular region @xmath246 in fig.[fig4 ] , the regions @xmath247 in fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig7]@xmath186 etc .",
    "these regions may all be interpreted as static regions outside a non - compact black hole but with different horizons than the ones shaded in darkgrey in the figures .",
    "such extra static regions are not seen in the standard ads c - metric in einstein gravity .",
    "the complete understanding of the spacetime represented by our solution is still awaiting to be done , and presumably an analysis on the global structures may be a good starting point .",
    "anyway , we have seen plenty reasons to expect that the c - metric solution to the cgccs model contain much richer physics as compared to the c - metric solution of einstein gravity .",
