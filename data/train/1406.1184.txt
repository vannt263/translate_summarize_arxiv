    "models of substellar evolution have been notoriously under constrained in the brown dwarf regime , but the last several years has seen significant progress .",
    "an increasing number of brown dwarf visual binaries have dynamical masses @xcite , and there are now several transiting brown dwarfs that provide tests of the mass  radius relationship",
    ". however , the total energy output of substellar objects as a function of mass and age has still barely been tested , despite the fact that these fundamental predictions underpin the mass estimates for all brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets that lack directly determined masses .    until now there has been only been one system that enables a robust test of substellar luminosity evolution because of the demanding requirements of both precise mass , age , and luminosity determinations . in @xcite",
    ", we found that the components of the brown dwarf visual binary hd  130948bc  were @xmath02@xmath1 more luminous than expected from models given their age and mass .",
    "this was a surprising result , given that the bulk properties of brown dwarfs from evolutionary models were thought to be relatively robust against the boundary conditions of models by several hundred myr .",
    "furthermore , there has been no satisfactory theoretical explanation of how such a luminosity problem might arise ; for example , even custom magnetic models of hd  130948bc  can not match the observations @xcite .",
    "we also note that an earlier dynamical mass measurement for the substellar companion gl  802b hinted at a similar luminosity problem due to its likely thick disk membership being inconsistent with an age of @xmath22gyr inferred from evolutionary models using its mass and near - infrared flux @xcite . with no other systems to test models",
    "it has not yet been clear if there truly is a problem in predictions of substellar luminosity evolution , which could affect model - derived mass estimates and thereby have wide - ranging implications , or if our one test case was simply an unfortunate outlier .",
    "we present a dynamical mass for the l  dwarf binary gl  417bc  that provides new evidence for the same substellar luminosity problem found for hd  130948bc .",
    "@xcite originally identified the gl  417bc system ( unresolved ) as the lithium - bearing l4.5 dwarf 2massw  j1112257 + 354813 .",
    "@xcite subsequently found that it was co - moving at a distance of 90@xmath3 from the star gl  417 , now dubbed gl  417a .",
    "the revised _",
    "hipparcos _",
    "parallax for gl  417a  is @xmath4mas , giving a distance of @xmath5pc to the system and projected separation of @xmath6au for the gl  417ab pair .",
    "@xcite used age indicators for the primary star such as chromospheric activity , rotation , and lithium absorption to estimate an age of 80300myr for the system .",
    "this age range implied a substellar mass for 2massw  j1112257 + 354813 , corroborated by the detection of lithium in its spectrum .",
    "@xcite presented _ hubble space telescope _ wide - field planetary camera  2 ( _ hst_/wfpc2 ) images resolving this object as a binary , named gl  417bc , with a projected separation of 70mas ( or 1.5au ) and an estimated orbital period of @xmath710  years .",
    "this made gl  417bc  one of the most likely substellar binaries to yield a dynamical mass from determining the visual orbit of the brown dwarfs around each other .",
    "however , unlike some substellar companions , gl  417bc  is too distant from its host star to use natural guide star adaptive optics ( ao ) , and there has been no resolved astrometry of gl  417bc  published in more than a decade since it was discovered to be a binary .",
    "we have obtained keck laser guide star ( lgs ) ao imaging of gl  417bc .",
    "combined with the original _ hst _  imaging , our astrometric data set spans more than 13  years and enables us to determine a precise total dynamical mass for this binary . moreover ,",
    "gl  417a  provides a much more precise age estimate than is typically possible for stars in the field population because of its youth .",
    "therefore , gl  417bc  now joins hd  130948bcas the only brown dwarf binaries with precisely determined masses _ and _ ages .",
    "we used the facility near - infrared camera nirc2 with the lgs ao system at the keck  ii telescope @xcite to image the binary gl  417bc  at eight epochs spanning 2007  march  25  ut to 2014  may  9  ut .",
    "we obtained data in standard mauna kea observatories ( mko ) photometric bandpasses @xcite .",
    "bandpass of nirc2 compared to other photometric systems . ]",
    "the lgs was kept centered in nirc2 s narrow camera field - of - view while we obtained dithered images of the target .",
    "the wavefront sensor recorded flux from the lgs equivalent to a @xmath810.4  mag star . for tip - tilt correction we used the star sdss  j111229.47 + 354813.2 , which is 46@xmath3 away from gl  417bc , and the lower bandwidth sensor monitoring this source recorded flux equivalent to a @xmath918.0mag star .",
    "we note that this tip - tilt star was not provided by the standard keck idl routine ` findttref`the tool used by most keck lgs observers to determine if a target has suitable reference stars  because it does not exist in the usno - b catalog @xcite .",
    "however , we noticed it by eye in the _ hst_/wfpc2 data and in digital sky survey images , and it also appears in subsequently released sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data .",
    "our procedure for reducing and analyzing keck lgs data is described in detail in our previous work @xcite . to summarize briefly ,",
    "we measure binary parameters using the starfinder software package when the separation is large and by fitting three - component gaussians when the components are too close for starfinder to robustly identify two distinct sources .",
    "we derive uncertainties by applying our fitting method to artificial binary images constructed from images of psf reference stars with similar fwhm and strehl ratio , as well as by checking the scatter between individual dithered images .",
    "we use the nirc2 astrometric calibration from @xcite , which includes a correction for the nonlinear distortion of the camera and has a pixel scale of @xmath10mas  and an orientation for the detector s @xmath11-axis of @xmath12 east of north .",
    "figure  [ fig : keck ] shows contour plots of our imaging data at each epoch , stacked for the purposes of display .    in table",
    "[ tbl : obs ] , we present the results of our keck imaging , including the fwhm and strehl ratio at each epoch along with the derived binary parameters .",
    "as a check on these parameters , we note that the -band flux ratio is consistent between the five epochs for which we have data in that bandpass with a @xmath13 of 4.8 for 4 degrees of freedom ( dof ; @xmath14 ) .",
    "the weighted average and corresponding error is @xmath15mag .",
    "the _ hst_/wfpc2 discovery images of gl  417bc  were taken on 2001  february  14  ut as part of go-8581 ( pi reid ) , with one image each in f814w and f1042 m .",
    "we used the f814w image for measuring astrometry , because the psf is smaller at shorter wavelengths and thus enables more robust deblending of this tight 1.6-pixel binary .",
    "as in our previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we applied a binary fitting routine based on the tinytim model of the _ hst _  psf @xcite to both the data and numerous simulated binary images constructed from single stars observed by _ hst_/wfpc2 .",
    "the simulated binaries were constrained to be within 0.2  pixels of the actual configuration of gl  417bc , and the difference between the input and output values were used to determine the rms scatter and systematic offsets in the binary parameters .",
    "we found the offsets to be somewhat less than the scatter in separation ( @xmath16mas ) , position angle ( p.a . ;",
    "@xmath17 ) , and flux ratio ( @xmath18mag ) , where our quoted values are @xmath19 .",
    "table  [ tbl : obs ] shows the derived binary parameters after applying the offsets from our simulations and using the rms values for the errors .",
    "our results are somewhat inconsistent with the parameters reported in @xcite by 6.1mas ( 1.7@xmath20 ) , 3@xmath214 ( 1.6@xmath20 ) , and 0.52mag ( 4.0@xmath20 ) .",
    "however , we note that their paper adopted a simplification in determining errors , namely that a single value for the uncertainty in given parameter was used for all 60150mas ( 1.33.3  pixel ) binaries .",
    "this obscures the fact that the tighter binaries over this range should have larger uncertainties than the wider ones .",
    "for example , their figures  2 and 3 illustrate this well , and their larger truth - minus - fitted scatter over the narrower 6070mas separation range is sufficient to explain the apparent discrepancies between our two sets of binary parameters .",
    "there is much larger scatter in p.a .  and flux ratio than is accounted for by their single uncertainty values for these parameters , and there is an apparent trend for these tightest binaries that their fitting overestimates the separation by @xmath023mas . in the following",
    ", we will conservatively consider both our own _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 astrometry that relies on simulations tailored specifically to gl  417bc  as well as the values reported by @xcite .",
    "the relative astrometry for gl  417bc  presented in table  [ tbl : obs ] spans more than 13  years in time and 334@xmath22 in p.a . , enabling us to robustly determine its orbital parameters for the first time . as in our previous work ( e.g. , *",

    "* ) , we use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique to determine the posterior distributions of all quantities .",
    "we briefly summarize our procedure , as we have made some minor modifications to our code compared to our previous work .",
    "as before , we use a metropolis - hastings jump acceptance criterion with gibbs sampling that alters only one parameter at each step in the chain ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . before running our science chains ,",
    "we first run a test chain according to the method outlined by @xcite in order to determine optimal step sizes for each parameter ( see section  2.4 of @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we then run 20 science chains starting at different points in parameter space , chosen by adding gaussian noise scaled by the step sizes to the best - fit values .",
    "we find the best - fit values in advance by using our least - squares minimization routine based on the mpfit idl package @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "each of our 20 markov chains has @xmath23 steps , with every hundredth step saved .",
    "we chose to step in parameters that would result in appropriate uninformative ( i.e. , flat ) prior assumptions .",
    "for the orbital period ( @xmath24 ) and semimajor axis ( @xmath25 ) , our prior is log - flat as we stepped in @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the priors in eccentricity ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    "argument of periastron ( @xmath29 ) , time of periastron passage ( @xmath30 ) , and p.a .  of the ascending node ( @xmath31 )",
    "are linear - flat as we stepped in @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , our inclination ( @xmath34 ) prior assumes randomly distributed viewing configurations by stepping in @xmath35 . in our previous work",
    "we modified the parameters being stepped along after every @xmath36 iterations in order to increase the efficiency of exploring of a `` curved '' region of low @xmath13 in parameter space .",
    "however , for well - determined orbits like the case of gl  417bc  this is not necessary and the increased computational time needed for such optimization ultimately results in lowered efficiency .",
    "table  [ tbl : orbit ] shows the resulting orbital parameters found by our mcmc analysis , and figure  [ fig : orbit ] shows our relative astrometry alongside the best - fit orbit .",
    "the lowest @xmath13 value in our chains is 21.56 ( 17  dof ) , which has a probability of 0.202 according to the @xmath13 distribution , implying that our adopted astrometric errors are reasonable .",
    "the parameter values at this chain step are considered the best - fit orbit , which is identical to that found by our mpfit routine . in table",
    "[ tbl : orbit ] , we give these best - fit values along with the median and 1@xmath20 and 2@xmath20 confidence intervals for each parameter chain .",
    "we define our confidence intervals as the smallest range of values that captures 68.3% and 95.4% of the distribution .",
    "we adopt this approach in order to report the most likely range of parameter values from distributions that are often asymmetrical , sometimes sharply bounded ( e.g. , @xmath37 ) , and in principle could be multi - modal . in such cases , intervals computed from the 68.3% and 95.4% of chain steps centered on the median ( like we have reported in previous work ) may not capture the peak of the posterior distribution .",
    "we note that the confidence intervals we report here all include the best - fit parameter values .",
    "we used the ensemble of chains to compute gelman - rubin statistics for all parameters and check for convergence and found gelman - rubin values of @xmath381.001 .",
    "these imply that all parameters are converged given the standard criterion requiring gelman - rubin values @xmath71.2 @xcite .",
    "combining our orbit with the parallax distance allows us to measure the total mass ( ) of gl  417bc  directly from kepler s third law .",
    "we find @xmath39  ( 3.2% error ) , with 1.3% of the error coming from the uncertainty in the orbital parameters and 2.9% from the parallax uncertainty .",
    "we investigated the impact of using the different _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 astrometry discussed in section  [ sec : hst ] by computing additional mcmc chains . when we used the separation and p.a .",
    "as reported by @xcite for the discovery epoch , all resulting orbital parameter distributions agreed well , with the 1@xmath20 confidence intervals overlapping in all cases and a minimum @xmath13 value nearly identical to ours . for a direct comparison of the total mass implied by the different sets of astrometry",
    ", we ignore the parallax error and find that the 1@xmath20 mass interval using the @xcite astrometry overlaps with our 1@xmath20 range of 0.09340.0959 .",
    "thus , the choice of _",
    "astrometry does not have a significant impact on the resulting dynamical mass , likely because the orbit fit is dominated by our more precise and more numerous keck lgs ao astrometric data .",
    "the age and composition of all three components in the gl  417 system can be established from the solar - type primary star gl  417a  under the conservative assumption that the system formed coevally from the same bulk material .",
    "@xcite report a slightly super - solar metallicity of @xmath40fe / h@xmath41 = 0.09\\pm0.03$]dex . in the following analysis , due to a lack of substellar evolutionary and atmospheric models that sample metallicity at such a fine level",
    ", we will compare to solar metallicity models but also consider the impact of this limitation on our resulting interpretations .",
    "numerous methods for estimating the age of a solar - type star such as gl  417a  are available .",
    "foremost among these in terms of claimed precision is gyrochronology , which relies on the fact that stars lose angular momentum with age in a predictable way ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent advances in obtaining rotation periods and membership data for large samples of stars in clusters has enabled a calibration of this spin - down against cluster isochronal ages , one of the most trusted clocks in astrophysics .",
    "@xcite defined an empirical formalism to account for the fact that the rate of change in stellar rotation period depends on mass , which he parametrized as a function of @xmath42 color .",
    "we have used these relations with the improved calibration from @xcite to derive the age of gl  417a . for the rotation period ,",
    "we use the five independent measurements obtained by @xcite over six years .",
    "the weighted average and rms of these rotation periods is @xmath43  days , which agrees well with the period of 8  days reported by @xcite .",
    "combined with the @xmath44 color of gl  417a(@xmath45mag , neglecting reddening ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the gyrochronology relation yields an age of @xmath46dex ( @xmath47myr ) , where we have computed errors in a monte carlo fashion as described in section  4.3 of @xcite .",
    "perhaps the next best calibrated empirical relations for determining age are those that track magnetic activity either using h and k chromospheric emission or x - ray emission . using data from mount wilson that spans approximately twenty years ,",
    "@xcite report a time - averaged value of @xmath48dex for gl  417a .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the single - epoch value of @xmath49dex reported by @xcite , as well as the older mount wilson value of @xmath50dex from @xcite .",
    "we use the @xcite  value to compute an age for gl  417afrom the chromospheric activity relations derived by @xcite .",
    "we use the method recommended by these authors which first converts the  value to a rossby number ( i.e. , rotation period divided by the convective turnover timescale ) , which we find to be @xmath51 , adopting an uncertainty of 0.10 as suggested by @xcite when using high quality mount wilson data . the rossby number is then converted to a rotation period by estimating  from the star s color , and this step yields @xmath52  days and thus an activity - derived rotation period of @xmath53  days .",
    "this is finally converted to an age via their gyrochronology relation , which gives @xmath54dex .",
    "this is strikingly different from the age derived directly from the actual rotation period ( 2.2@xmath20 , given the adopted uncertainties ) .",
    "we note that if we use equation  3 from @xcite , which gives a simpler relation just between  and age , we find a consistent but less precise age ( @xmath55dex ) that is still 1.2@xmath20 younger than the gyrochronology age .",
    "@xcite provide a similar method for estimating age from x - ray emission . for gl  417a ,",
    "found an x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio of @xmath56dex . using the method proposed by @xcite",
    ", we derive a rossby number of @xmath57 from this  value , and thus an activity - derived rotation period of @xmath58  days .",
    "this agrees well with the actual measured rotation period and thus results in an age of @xmath59dex that is consistent with the gyrochronology age .",
    "other indicators provide some information about the age of gl  417a , though not at the same precision as rotation and activity .",
    "@xcite measured a lithium abundance of @xmath60dex ( @xmath61   ) for gl  417a .",
    "thus , given its effective temperature ( @xmath62k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gl  417a  lies somewhat below ( i.e. , older than ) the mean relations of @xmath63 versus  for members of the 625-myr - old praesepe and hyades clusters and significantly below the 125-myr - old pleiades cluster @xcite .",
    "a comparison of gl  417a s fundamental properties to stellar evolution models could offer an isochronal age , but as is the case for many field stars the analysis of @xcite gives only an upper limit for the age of gl  417a  ( @xmath72.9  gyr , 68.3% confidence ) .",
    "finally , we compute the heliocentric space motion of gl  417a , @xmath64 , with @xmath65 positive toward the galactic center , based on the new _ hipparcos _  parallax and proper motion from and a radial velocity of @xmath66  compiled by .",
    "the space motion of gl  417a  has not linked it to any known moving groups or associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we also find no such linkages using the online calculators of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we briefly note that gl  417bc  itself could provide a system age constraint from spectroscopic signatures of low surface gravity .",
    "@xcite discussed this system in detail , and without resolved optical spectroscopy they made the reasonable assumption that the integrated - light spectrum was dominated by gl  417b(@xmath67f814w = @xmath68mag ) .",
    "they found that gl  417b  is practically indistinguishable from normal , older field l4l5 dwarfs .",
    "the alkali lines that typically weaken for low gravity objects appear normal , with the possible exception of ( 7800 , 7948 ) .",
    "they also note the tio bandhead at 8200  might be weaker than normal , though we note this could also be due to dilution from the later type secondary component .",
    "@xcite conclude that gl  417b  is only `` slightly peculiar '' because the spectroscopic signatures are not as obvious as in lower surface gravity objects .",
    "@xcite examined the near - infrared integrated - light spectrum of gl  417bc  and assigned a field gravity classification ( fld - g ) because multiple gravity - sensitive features were consistent with normal field objects .",
    "overall , we find that the spectrum of gl  417bc  agrees with our older gyrochronology age of @xmath47myr and is somewhat inconsistent with the originally published age estimate of 80300myr from @xcite .    in summary , the most robust age available for the gl  417",
    "system is from gyrochronology of the solar - type primary , @xmath69dex , which implies that gl  417a  is somewhat older or consistent with the hyades .",
    "only one age dating method is apparently inconsistent with this .",
    "the chromospheric emission of gl  417a  traced by h and k seems to imply a much younger age of @xmath70dex according to the calibration of @xcite .",
    "however , examining the range of activity levels for members of young clusters reveals that gl  417a , with @xmath71dex , is actually comfortably within the 68% confidence intervals of both the 500-myr - old ursa majoris group ( @xmath72dex to @xmath73dex ) and the 625-myr - old hyades cluster ( @xmath74dex to @xmath75dex ) .",
    "thus , the chromospheric activity traced by h and k is not actually inconsistent with all the other indicators , including activity traced by x - ray emission , that agree with the gyrochronology age of @xmath47myr .",
    "this agrees with chromospheric and x - ray activity being manifestations of a magnetic dynamo that is driven by rotation , which is also likely why rotation  age relations show less scatter than activity  age relations .",
    "@xcite report resolved spectral types for the components of gl  417bc  from spectral decomposition using its integrated - light infrared spectrum along with the measured @xmath76-band flux ratio ( the march 2007 data in our table  [ tbl : obs ] are the same as in their table  5 ) .",
    "@xcite found infrared types of l@xmath77 and l@xmath78 for the primary and secondary components , respectively , in good agreement with the integrated - light optical spectral type of l4.5 reported by @xcite . our new data presented here would not significantly better constrain the resolved spectral types and are in good agreement with the @xcite estimates of flux ratios in other bandpasses ( @xmath79mag , @xmath80mag ) , so we simply adopt the @xcite spectral types here .",
    "to derive bolometric luminosities ( ) for both components , we used our resolved @xmath76-band photometry and the bolometric correction  spectral type relation from @xcite .",
    "we converted the integrated - light photometry of gl  417bc  from 2mass @xcite to the mko system using synthetic photometry derived from the spex prism spectrum of gl  417bc  itself @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath76-band photometry is @xmath81mag and @xmath82mag for gl  417b  and gl  417c , respectively .",
    "when calculating bolometric corrections we account for both the uncertainties in the resolved spectral types and scatter in the polynomial relations of @xcite , the latter of which dominates , and we find bc@xmath83mag for gl  417b  and bc@xmath84mag for gl  417c .",
    "therefore , we arrive at @xmath85 values of @xmath86dex and @xmath87dex for the two components , respectively , where the uncertainty in the distance is negligible compared to the uncertainties in bolometric corrections .",
    "this corresponds to an integrated - light bolometric flux of @xmath88 . as a check , we computed the flux over the wavelength range of 0.802.55  from the integrated - light spex spectrum of the binary and found @xmath89 , which is @xmath90 of our total estimated . in comparison , for a bt - settl model @xcite with properties similar to the components of gl  417bc  that we derive in section  [ sec : model ] , @xmath91k and @xmath92dex ( cgs ) ,",
    "54% of the bolometric flux emerges over 0.802.55 .",
    "thus , our estimated  values are in good agreement with direct integration of the near - ir spectral energy distribution .",
    "a summary of all the measured quantities for gl  417bc  quoted above are summarized in table  [ tbl : meas ] . in the following analysis ,",
    "we track the covariance in luminosity ratio with other parameters like mass ratio and the temperature difference between the two binary components , all of which depend commonly on the uncertainties in distance and bolometric correction . for consistency",

    "substellar evolutionary models predict how the properties of brown dwarfs depend on age for a given mass and composition .",
    "thus with a directly measured total mass for gl  417bc  and an age and composition inferred from the primary star gl  417a , we can derive model - predicted values for , , etc .",
    "conversely , we can use a directly measured property like  along with the system mass to infer the age from evolutionary models , or use  and age to infer mass .",
    "these mirrored scenarios correspond respectively to `` mass benchmarks '' and `` age benchmarks , '' objects for which at least two of three fundamental properties are measured , as discussed in detail by @xcite . in fact , since mass and luminosity can typically both be measured to high precision ( 3%10% ) they are the preferred pair of parameters with which to infer other properties from models , even if age ( typical precision @xmath9525% ) and mass are both available .",
    "we consider multiple substellar evolutionary calculations in our analysis .",
    "the lyon dusty models @xcite are among the most commonly used , and they should be appropriate for the components of gl  417bc  because their mid - l spectral types imply cloud opacity above the photosphere .",
    "* hereinafter sm08 ) were the first to compute evolutionary models in which cloud opacity changes with time .",
    "their hybrid models assume the photosphere smoothly transitions from cloudy to cloudless as objects cool from effective temperatures of 1400k to 1200k .",
    "the components of gl  417bc  turn out to both be warmer than 1400k according to these models , so in our case the hybrid isochrones are essentially equivalent to the cloudy ( @xmath96 ) isochrones from sm08 .",
    "we present parameters derived from the sm08 hybrid models as well as the fully cloudy and cloud free cases .",
    "we also consider the lyon cond models that assume any clouds are completely below the photosphere .",
    "these , along with sm08 cloud free models , should not be appropriate for gl  417bc  because the lack of dust opacity results in spectral energy distributions highly inconsistent with l  dwarfs , but they provide a useful counterpoint to the other extreme assumption made by lyon dusty and sm08 cloudy models about the surface boundary conditions .",
    "finally , we include evolutionary models from @xcite as they are still commonly used in the literature .",
    "these models are cloud free , use `` gray '' atmospheres over the temperature range considered here , and also do not benefit from updates to opacities made over the last decade .",
    "our method for employing the system mass and individual luminosities of a binary to derive all other properties from evolutionary models is described in detail in our previous work @xcite .",
    "briefly , at every given age from 10myr to 10gyr we calculate the model - predicted component masses , as well as , , radius ( @xmath97 ) , lithium abundance , and near - infrared colors , from their measured luminosities .",
    "this is done in a monte carlo fashion such that we use 10@xmath98 values for a component s , resulting in 10@xmath98 mass estimates at each age .",
    "we then step through each of the 10@xmath98  pairs , considering the full range of ages for that pair , sum the component masses as a function of age , and determine the age that matches the measured total mass by interpolating the curve .",
    "this is also done in a monte carlo fashion such that we use 10@xmath98 values for the measured  at this step .",

    "gl  417bc is only the second field brown dwarf system after hd  130948bc  with a precisely measured mass , age , and luminosity . by coincidence ,",
    "the two systems have very similar fundamental properties , with the exception of the projected separation of their host stars .",
    "thus they provide two independent tests of substellar models at roughly the same age , mass , and metallicity but with objects that may have had different formation pathways and dynamical evolution .",
    "this is particularly important because our age determinations implicitly assume that the rotational evolution of the host stars is typical compared to single stars in open clusters , which are used to calibrate the gyrochronology relations .",
    "this assumption is not obvious as our first results came from hd  130948bc , where the brown dwarfs lie at a projected separation of only 47au from their host star .",
    "such a separation could be consistent with hd  130948bc  forming via gravitational instability in a long - lived , massive circumstellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and since disks are suspected to influence stellar rotation formation of a massive binary brown dwarf in the disk may have caused atypical rotational properties for hd  130948a .",
    "but if some particular mechanism was responsible for altering the rotational history of hd  130948a , it is implausible to believe that it would also be at work in the gl  417 system .",
    "gl  417bc  is separated from its host star by 1970au in projection , suggesting a very different dynamical history from the hd  130948 system .",
    "remarkably , we find nearly the same results from these two independent tests of substellar luminosity evolution .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : model ] , the model - derived ages for gl  417bc  are @xmath02@xmath20 younger than the gyro age for gl  417a .",
    "this implies that the components of gl  417bc  are more luminous than expected given their masses and age . for comparison ,",
    "we present newly derived parameters for hd  130948bc  in table  5 , using the updated orbit from @xcite and improved bolometric corrections from @xcite .",

    "these ages are 3.6@xmath20 and 2.9@xmath20 younger than the gyro age for hd  130948a , @xmath118dex @xcite .    in principle",
    ", this luminosity  age discrepancy could be caused by systematic errors either in substellar evolutionary models or in gyrochronology relations .",
    "the challenges associated with age determinations for stars are well documented ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recent modeling of error sources in the gyrochronology age for any arbitrary field star by @xcite show that at our primary stars masses ( 1.081.11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and rotation periods ( 7.88.3days ) we may expect @xmath020% systematic errors in our derived ages , comparable to our empirically derived error bars of 0.08dex .",
    "however , the sources of this error ( differential rotation and varying initial conditions ) should be essentially random , and thus it would be very unlikely for two unrelated field stars to show the same age discrepancy .",
    "we therefore conclude that altered substellar evolution model cooling rates would provide a simpler explanation for our observed luminosity  age discrepancy , and in the following analysis we proceed under this assumption .",
    "( we note that if the cause is instead a systematic age offset present in stellar age  rotation  activity relations , this would have its own problematic implications that could range from incorrectly estimated ages for host stars of directly imaged planets to fundamental errors in the ages of the clusters used to calibrate the relations . )    to illustrate our observed luminosity  age discrepancies , we show probability distributions of the difference between model - derived system ages and gyro ages in figure  [ fig : dage ] .",
    "we also plot the joint probability distribution that results from combining these two results .",
    "the joint distribution implicitly assumes that the components in both hd  130948bc  and gl  417bc  probe similar physics because their masses are only @xmath010%15% different and their ages are indistinguishable , @xmath119dex .",
    "the joint discrepancy in age is 4.0@xmath20 for sm08 hybrid models , 3.5@xmath20 for lyon dusty models , and 2.3@xmath20 for cond . to quantify the discrepancy in terms of luminosity , we scaled up the  values predicted by models by a constant factor to find the boost that brings the ages into exact agreement . for lyon",
    "dusty models , the scaling factor needed was 0.25dex for gl  417bc  and 0.35dex for hd  130948bc , and for sm08 hybrid models they were 0.27dex and 0.40dex , respectively .",
    "lyon cond models require the smallest boost of only 0.15dex for gl  417bc  and 0.25dex for hd  130948bc .",
    "the fact that the level of discrepancy varies widely between models is a reflection of the different luminosity predictions for substellar objects in different models .",
    "the inclusion of additional opacity from dust clouds has long been known to result in a lower luminosity at a given mass and age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this explains why the lyon dusty models are more discrepant with our unexpectedly luminous brown dwarfs than the cond models .",
    "sm08 also note that their cloudy models are slightly lower luminosity than lyon dusty models .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbol - compare ] shows the differences in predicted luminosities as a function of age for a model object of similar mass to the binary components we consider here ( 0.050 ) . across a wide range of ages , and particularly from a few hundred myr to @xmath21gyr , some of the most commonly used models differ in their luminosity predictions significantly . at ages of 700800myr , this amounts to a @xmath00.2dex range in .",
    "thus , mass estimates from evolutionary models are actually quite dependent on the choice of model .    a particularly interesting case shown in figure  [ fig : lbol - compare ]",
    "is the one set of models that attempts to account for cloud evolution as a substellar object cools .",
    "the sm08 hybrid models show a feature in  vs.  age not seen in any other models : a bump in  that accompanies the disappearance of cloud opacity from the photosphere .",
    "this is at least partly understandable because an object with no cloud opacity is more luminous , as noted above in the comparison between lyon cond and dusty models .",
    "however , the sm08 hybrid models actually greatly outshine the lyon cond models for a few gyr after the clouds disappear .",
    "this is not simply a consequence of differences in the energy transport budgets of the two models ( lyon models account for electron conduction that dominates @xmath952gyr , while sm08 do not ) because the sm08 hybrid models actually reach a similar or somewhat lower  as cond at 10gyr .",
    "therefore , we find that cloud evolution can have an even more profound impact on luminosity evolution than previously thought .",
    "the sm08 hybrid models are the first to self - consistently calculate substellar evolution accounting for cloud disappearance , and they adopt a simple interpolation between cloudy and cloudless model atmospheres to do so . however , the same group has long pointed out the possibility of patchy clouds @xcite , and they have also investigated the impact of having two types of clouds in different regions of the surface on the colors and spectra of brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "recent observations of brown dwarf variability , particularly in the l / t transition , now provide strong evidence for such patchy clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these opacity holes are inferred to cover a significant fraction of the surface ( @xmath210% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this could alter model predictions of luminosity evolution as compared to sm08 s smooth interpolation between cloudy and cloudless .",
    "we suggest that if cloudless regions appeared earlier , then the luminosity bump seen in sm08 hybrid models may occur earlier , i.e. , at several hundred myr instead of a few gyr .",
    "this speculative idea could provide a solution to the over luminosity we have observed for both hd  130948bc  and gl  417bc .    finally , we note that metallicity is not likely to play a significant role in modulating . to illustrate this , we consider sm08 cloudless models at metallicities of @xmath120 , 0.0 , and + 0.3dex at an age of 800myr .",
    "the super - solar models predict  values higher by 0.030.04dex at masses of 0.0450.060 , whereas the sub - solar models predict 0.040.05dex lower  for the same mass range .",
    "thus , at the metallicities of the gl  417 and hd  130948 systems , @xmath121 } \\approx 0.0$]0.1dex , we find from simple interpolation that the error in our model luminosities are @xmath380.01dex by assuming solar metallicity , i.e. , negligible compared to our 0.030.04dex  measurement errors .",
    "according to the scaling relations presented by @xcite , @xmath122 so a large systematic error in model luminosities will result in a correspondingly smaller error in masses derived from those models . to illustrate how variations in predicted luminosity evolution impact model - derived masses , figure  [ fig : dmtot ] shows the difference between our measured dynamical masses for gl  417bc  and hd  130948bc  and those that we infer from evolutionary models based on the component luminosities and system ages .",
    "the lyon dusty models gives masses 15%20% ( @xmath00.09dex ) higher than we measured , while the discrepancy is larger for sm08 hybrid models ( 20%25% ; @xmath00.11dex ) .",
    "the lyon cond models show the smallest discrepancy , even though they are not intended to be appropriate for these dust - bearing mid - l dwarfs , and correspondingly the masses derived from these models are only 10%20% ( @xmath00.07dex ) higher than we measure .    to broaden our discussion beyond gl  417bc  and hd  130948bc , we show in figure  [ fig : lbol - compare ] the fractional differences between masses derived from the various models we consider here over a wide range of assumed ages and  values .",
    "for example , lyon cond models are typically more luminous than lyon dusty at a given mass and age and thus masses derived from dusty will be higher than from cond at a given  and age .",
    "( note that this trend reverses at ages of 510gyr simply because at such old ages objects have either stabilized on the main sequence at high temperatures not significantly affected by dust or cooled to temperatures where dusty models are not appropriate , @xmath123k . )",
    "similar trends appear in the comparison between sm08 cloudy and cloudless models that are tracked to lower luminosities ( lyon dusty models are not computed below @xmath124 ) .",
    "the largest differences in model - derived masses for the sm08 cloudy / cloudless comparison case are @xmath025% and appear at 1gyr and @xmath125  ( @xmath126k ) because at these low temperatures sm08 cloudy models are actually more luminous than cloudless models .    as discussed above ,",
    "the largest discrepancies between various model predictions of luminosity evolution all involve the sm08 hybrid models that , unlike other models , display a prominent luminosity increase as clouds disappear .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbol - compare ] shows that masses derived from sm08 fully cloudy models , which are nearly identical to lyon dusty models , are up to 25% higher than those that would be inferred from the sm08 hybrid models .",
    "the sm08 cloudy / hybrid mass discrepancy is @xmath12710% over a range in  that corresponds to @xmath1281400k and for ages up to @xmath05gyr . because cloud disappearance is parametrized purely by  in the sm08 hybrid models ,",
    "the same effect occurs for younger objects but at higher luminosities due to their larger radii .",
    "therefore if cloud disappearance indeed causes such substantial changes in evolution , it will affect mass estimates for substellar objects of all ages , except perhaps at old ages of @xmath210gyr when all but the very highest mass brown dwarfs have long been without their clouds .",
    "we have presented a dynamical mass measurement for the l4.5+l6 binary gl  417bc  based on keck lgs ao imaging obtained over 20072014 . combined with reanalysis of the _ hst _  discovery images from 2001",
    ", our data now span over 13 years of the @xmath129yr orbit , allowing us to determine a precise system mass of @xmath130 .",
    "the host star gl  417a  is a young solar - type star for which we derive a gyrochronology age of @xmath47myr that agrees with other ( less precise ) ages estimated from activity indicators , lithium , and isochrones .",
    "gl  417bc  now joins hd  130948bc  as only the second system of brown dwarfs with a precisely measured mass , age , _ and _ luminosity .",
    "these two systems coincidentally have similar component masses to within 10%15% , indistinguishable ages , and nearly solar composition .",
    "this makes gl  417bc  ideal for assessing the `` luminosity problem '' identified by our prior work on hd  130948bc , for which we found that lyon dusty models under - predicted the component luminosities by a factor of @xmath02 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the larger projected separation ( 1970au ) between gl  417bc  and its host star compared to hd  130948bc  ( 47au ) guards against a peculiar angular momentum history impacting stellar rotation - based age estimates .    gl  417bc  displays a nearly identical over - luminosity compared to models as we previously observed for hd  130948bc  ( @xmath131dex ) .",
    "this new evidence strongly suggests that there is indeed a luminosity problem , at least for substellar objects with masses around 4560  at an age of @xmath0800myr . in search of a possible solution",
    ", we compared the luminosity predictions from currently available evolutionary models and noted that cloud disappearance can have a surprisingly large impact on luminosity evolution . while it has long been recognized that cloud opacity suppresses the luminosity of a brown dwarf at a given age and mass",
    ", recent models actually show that as clouds disappear from a dusty brown dwarf it can , for a time , outshine even cloud - free objects of the same mass and age .",
    "however , this boost to the luminosity does not occur early enough in hybrid models from @xcite to explain the over - luminosity we observe .",
    "these models adopt a smooth interpolation between cloudy and cloudless boundary conditions , but the latest observations of brown dwarf variability suggest a patchy process is likely more realistic .",
    "we therefore speculate that opacity holes may appear early enough , e.g. , at mid - l spectral types like our two binaries , to initiate a luminosity boost that would bring evolutionary models into agreement with our observations .",
    "if cloud evolution is responsible for the observed luminosity problem , evolutionary models suggest that this phase would be relatively long - lived and span ages that encompass most of the field population of brown dwarfs , from a few hundred myr up to a few gyr .",
    "thus , masses derived from the commonly used dusty or cloudless evolutionary models would be over estimated by 10%25% , even for some time after clouds disappeared from view entirely .",
    "many of the known directly imaged gas - giant planets are l - type or l / t transition objects , so their model - derived properties would be particularly susceptible to systematic errors caused by clouds . under our speculative assumptions , higher mass brown dwarfs ( @xmath12760 ) should not be over - luminous at @xmath0800myr because they are still too hot to be affected by clouds , nor should brown dwarfs of similar mass to gl  417bc  and hd  130948bc  that are several gyr old , long after the boost has diminished .    the most direct evidence for this proposed scenario would be to measure the continuous mass  luminosity relation into the substellar regime of a young cluster , which would show clearly if there is indeed a boost in  associated with the disappearance of clouds .",
    "perhaps the most promising venue for a such a study is the pleiades , given that is among the nearest young clusters and the discovery of short - period binaries suitable for dynamical mass measurements will be enabled by high - spatial resolution surveys with _",
    "jwst _ and tmt ao .",
    "young moving groups might also provide such a test , though they possess fewer members .",
    "precise asteroseismic stellar ages of nearby stars from the tess mission @xcite will also revolutionize the substellar model tests possible for companions to stars in the solar neighborhood .",
