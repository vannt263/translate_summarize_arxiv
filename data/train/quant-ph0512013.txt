    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two parties , the sender alice and the receiver bob , to share a key which is provably secure against any attack by an eavesdropper ( eve ) , who may have superior computational and technological power .",
    "practical implementations of qkd use weak laser pulses , which can be easily controlled , or parametric down - conversion sources .",
    "these sources are used together with single - photon detectors to realize qkd . for",
    "a review see @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed to employ quadrature measurements of optical modes as detection devices , thereby introducing what is known as continuous variable ( cv ) qkd @xcite .",
    "some of these schemes use non - classical states , while others use coherent laser pulses .",
    "the aim is to exploit the high repetition rates of homodyne detection to overcome the limitation in detection rate that is typical for single - photon counting at standard telecom wavelength although recently other approaches using frequency conversion have been reported @xcite .    in the presence of loss",
    ", it seems to be impossible at first sight to distill a secret key if the transmission falls below 50% ( 3db loss ) @xcite .",
    "the reasoning is that eve can replace the lossy channel with an ideal one and use a beamsplitter to tap off alice s signals to simulate the losses .",
    "she then obtains the stronger signals whenever the losses are bigger than 50% .",
    "this apparent advantage of eve can be counteracted as it holds only on average , whether alice and bob are closely or loosely correlated .",
    "alice and bob can use postselection ( ps ) to retain only those events where they are closely correlated and then have some advantage over eve .",
    "the distillation of a secret key rate is then possible for any transmittance of the quantum channel @xcite .",
    "another way to circumvent the 3db loss limit is to use a suitable one - way information reconciliation procedure .",
    "if one builds up the key from bob s measured data rather than from alice s signals , eve always has less information about bob s measurement result than alice does .",
    "this technique is known as reverse reconciliation ( rr ) @xcite and leads to positive secret key rates for an arbitrary loss of the quantum channel @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to extend this scenario to a more realistic one .",
    "first , one could consider quantum channels that are not only lossy , but also impose excess gaussian noise on the quadrature distributions , as is seen in experiments .",
    "for any excess channel noise @xmath0 , as seen by bob , there exists a lower limit for the tolerable single - photon transmittivity @xmath1 , which is given by @xcite @xmath2 if the losses are higher , one can show that the data can be explained as originating from an intercept resend attack . in this scenario ,",
    "no secret key can be distilled @xcite . in accordance with this bound , it has been shown that the key rate obtained from ps - schemes decreases with increasing excess noise @xcite .",
    "here we follow another direction to extend the work of @xcite and stick to the assumption of a lossy but noiseless quantum channel .",
    "this scenario can be justified since detector noise is the dominant contribution to the total noise seen in the experiment @xcite . in a trusted device scenario",
    "one can assume that eve can not exploit the noise of bob s detectors .",
    "the remaining channel noise , which can leak information to eve , is typically less than one percent @xcite and can thus be neglected in a first approximation .",
    "similarly , in standard qkd with weak coherent pulses , the assumption of lossy but noiseless quantum channels together with detector dark counts which are inaccessible to eve lead to a very good approximation to the rigorous secure key rate . in this scenario we investigate the implications of the fact that any error correction scheme in a real - world application can not reach the fundamental performance limit given by shannon @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to compare the performance of reverse reconciliation and postselected schemes where the error correcting carries a non - negligible overhead in the amount of necessary communication .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we introduce the investigated protocol and give the framework to which our efficiency analysis applies .",
    "next we calculate a lower bound on the secret key rate under the assumption that the quantum channel between alice and bob is lossy but noiseless and eve is restricted to collective attacks .",
    "it turns out that eve s information about the key can be decomposed into effective binary channels .",
    "her information gain per use of such a binary channel is computed in section iii a for the protocol using direct reconciliation ( dr ) and for the reverse reconciled protocol ( rr ) in section iii b. afterwards , we calculate the total secret key rates for the various protocols and include the possibility to use postselection ( ps ) .",
    "we then proceed by including inefficient but trusted detectors on bob s side in our analysis in section iv .",
    "details about the numerical optimization of the secret key rates are given in section v. in the last section we conclude and discuss our results .",
    "we consider the situation where alice sends pure signal states @xmath3 through the quantum channel to bob , who can verify , for example by performing tomographic complete measurements , that he indeed always receives pure conditional states as expected in the absence of channel noise @xmath4 .",
    "it follows that the bipartite state of eve and bob has to be a product state . in the scenario of collective attacks ,",
    "the action of the channel can be modeled by a unitary coupling to an ancilla system accessible to eve , which is prepared in some standard state @xmath5 .",
    "the absence of noise allows to fully characterize eve s attack .",
    "we have @xmath6 since @xmath7 is unitary , we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is given by the state preparation and @xmath10 is fixed by bob s observation .",
    "therefore the overlaps @xmath11 , which contain all of eve s information about the signals , are fixed .    in our protocol",
    ", alice encodes her bit - value into the modulation of two coherent states according to @xmath12 with the coherent amplitude @xmath13 chosen to be real without loss of generality .",
    "the states are sent with equal a priori probabilities @xmath14 .",
    "bob performs a heterodyne measurement on the received states , which is mathematically equivalent to a projection onto a coherent state @xmath15 . from",
    "that he is able to conclude that he indeed received pure states .",
    "that in turn fixes eve s knowledge about the signal states . furthermore ,",
    "if bob receives attenuated coherent states @xmath16 , the states that eve holds have to be unitarily equivalent to those obtainable by the beamsplitter attack .",
    "the input states are transformed according to @xmath17 in this attack .",
    "after measuring the signals , bob assigns the bit - value 0 ( 1 ) , if @xmath18 is positive ( negative ) and then publicly announces @xmath19 and the modulus of @xmath18 of the measured @xmath20 .",
    "as we will see , this announcement will enable us to decompose the protocol into effective binary information channels .",
    "after the exchange of quantum signals between alice and bob is complete , they proceed with a classical post - processing phase in which they correct for errors in their bit - strings and cut out eve s knowledge about the key ( privacy amplification)@xcite .",
    "to do so , they need to transmit information though an authenticated but otherwise insecure classical channel .",
    "eve may listen and use any information exchanged over the public channel to optimize her attack .",
    "alice and bob may use the classical channel only in one direction for error correction .",
    "this will result in two non - equivalent ways of distilling a secret key from their shared classical data .",
    "communication from alice to bob is common in qkd and we will refer to it as direct reconciliation ( dr ) , whereas communication in the opposite direction is called reverse reconciliation ( rr ) @xcite . the secret key is built from the data that the sender in the classical communication step holds . in any case ,",
    "eve s knowledge is summarized in quantum states @xmath21 conditioned on bit - values held by the person who transmits the error correction information .",
    "her knowledge about the data can be quantified by the holevo quantity @xmath22 @xcite , given by @xmath23 which includes eve being allowed to measure out her ancillas collectively .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the secret key rate @xmath24 in this collective attack scenario will then be bounded from below by @xmath25 note that we have replaced the holevo quantity between alice and bob in theorem 1 of @xcite by the classical mutual information @xmath26 , since we are investigating a practical qkd scheme with our specified measurement setup .",
    "next , we will evaluate @xmath26 and @xmath22 for different protocols and noiseless detectors .",
    "after the quantum states are distributed and measured , alice and bob share classical correlated bit - strings .",
    "the mutual information @xmath26 between the two honest parties is determined by the conditional probabilities that bob projects onto @xmath20 .",
    "these are given by @xmath27 since eve is only performing an individual coupling of the signals to her ancilla systems , bob s measurement outcomes @xmath20 for different signals are independent . the mutual information @xmath26 between alice and bob can not depend on the value of @xmath19 , since the agreement on a bit - value does not depend on it .",
    "furthermore , the total probability that bob obtains the measurement outcome @xmath18 is given by @xmath28 from this we see that the two outcomes @xmath29 occur with the same probability .",
    "it follows that the announcement of @xmath30 and @xmath31 defines an effective binary information channel .",
    "the probability @xmath32 that bob assigns the wrong bit - value for a given positive value of @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 whereas the corresponding error probability @xmath35 for negative outcomes @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 from eqn .",
    "( [ condprob ] ) it follows that @xmath38 so that the effective information channels are symmetric in the error rate .",
    "each information channel contributes an amount of @xmath39 to the mutual information , @xmath26 , where @xmath40 is the entropy of the binary symmetric channel , @xmath41 the probability that an effective information channel is being used , is given by @xmath42 for the total transmission we find @xmath43 \\;.\\ ] ] in order to calculate the secret key rate @xmath24 according to eqn .",
    "( [ dev / win ] ) , we proceed by bounding eve s knowledge @xmath22 decomposed in the effective binary information channels .      usually in qkd",
    "the dr case is considered where the secret key is determined by alice s data .",
    "this means that alice sends bob error correction information in the information reconciliation step of the protocol .",
    "after alice and bob have corrected their bit - strings , eve can make use of the information transmitted over the public channel to optimize her measurements on her ancilla systems .",
    "the quantum states in eve s hand , conditioned on alice s data , are given by ( [ bsattack ] ) as @xmath44 these states are pure , so that we have @xmath45 .",
    "what remains to be calculated are the eigenvalues of @xmath46 the symmetry allows us to write the states @xmath47 as @xmath48 where the @xmath49 are orthonormal states .",
    "a short calculation shows that @xmath50 is already diagonal in this basis with eigenvalues @xmath51 , so that the holevo quantity is given by @xmath52 the normalization of @xmath53 @xmath54 and the overlap @xmath55 give the expression for the coefficients @xmath56 the overlap of the two coherent states ( [ conddr ] ) is @xmath57 so that the holevo quantity can be directly computed . since eve s quantum states are independent of bob s measurement outcomes ( see formula ( [ eveoverlap ] ) ) , the value of the holevo quantity for each effective channel , @xmath58 , does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we find that the total holevo quantity for all effective channels becomes @xmath59      in a reverse reconciliation scheme @xcite , bob sends error correction information to alice .",
    "therefore eve is interested in obtaining information about bob s measurement results rather than alice s signals . after bob s announcement of @xmath31 and @xmath19 ,",

    "( [ entropyrho ] ) and ( [ drchannel ] ) for dr and by formula ( [ holevorr2 ] ) for rr .",
    "here the sum runs over all possible information channels . in principle",
    "one can improve the performance of the protocols by dismissing channels where @xmath79 , since eve learns more on average about the signals than bob for those values of @xmath18 .",
    "this procedure is called postselection .",
    "the key rate ( [ keyideal ] ) refers to the case where a perfect error correction procedure is used ( shannon limit ) .",
    "ideally , in order to correct a bit - string of large length @xmath80 , one has to exchange asymptotically @xmath81 bits over the public channel .",
    "this information has to be hidden from eve , which can be done in principle by using a one - time - pad of exactly the same length . in the end , each use of an information channel with error rate @xmath62 costs @xmath40 secret bits to encrypt the necessary error correction information .",
    "bits per exchanged signal during error correction .",
    "this amount of information has then to be cut out in the privacy amplification steps .",
    "the final formulas do not change , however @xcite . ]",
    "it turns out that all effective information channels yield a positive contribution @xmath82 for the rr protocols in this idealized setting .",
    "this is in agreement with the result found in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to distill a secret key for any transmission of the quantum channel , and the performance of the rr protocol can not be improved further by using postselection .",
    "practical codes that work exactly at the shannon limit are not known .",
    "efficient codes work close to that limit , so in practice one has to reveal more information to correct one bit , i.e. @xmath83 , where @xmath84 represents the efficiency of the used protocol ( @xmath85 ) . the coefficient @xmath84 , which determines the overhead one has to pay for realistic error correction , depends in all practical schemes on the error rate @xmath62 . to see how the key rate @xmath24 scales",
    "when an error correction scheme with efficiency @xmath84 is used , we can rewrite formula ( [ keyideal ] ) as @xmath86 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath87 is again given by eqns .",
    "( [ entropyrho ] ) and ( [ drchannel ] ) in the dr and by ( [ holevorr2 ] ) in the rr case respectively .",
    "postselection can again be applied once alice and bob know the efficiency @xmath84 of their error correction procedure approximately .",
    "thus postselection now is relevant not only for dr , but also for the rr scenario .",
    "by now we have obtained secret key rates while neglecting any kind of noise . while experiments show that the channel noise is low , the noise of the detector is not negligible , but of the order of 0.1 shot noise units . in a trusted device scenario",
    "we assume that eve can not manipulate the detector noise to leak information about the signals to her . on the other hand",
    ", this noise increases the cost of error correction .",
    "it is interesting to see how this affects the key rate .",
    "we define the excess noise @xmath0 imposed by the detector by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the observed variance of @xmath18 seen in experiments and @xmath90 is the shot noise limited variance of @xmath18 .",
    "the probability that bob obtains the measurement outcome @xmath18 is then given by @xmath91 including detector noise .",
    "this leads to a modified error rate of the efficient binary channels , given by @xmath92 the secret key rate can then be calculated as described in the previous sections for any value of the excess noise @xmath0 , one has only to use the modified expressions for bob s probability distribution ( [ modprob ] ) and for the error rate ( [ moderate ] ) instead of eqns .",
    "( [ marginal ] ) and ( [ erate ] ) in all preceding formulas .",
    "this will lead to a decrease of the mutual information @xmath93 between alice and bob with growing excess noise @xmath0 to account for the higher cost of error correction . while the cost of privacy amplification @xmath94 per use of an effective binary information channel in the dr protocol ( [ drchannel ] ) is unaffected by the detector noise",
    ", the corresponding quantity @xmath95 ( [ holevorr2 ] ) for the rr protocol decreases with increasing detector noise .",
    "this effect originates from the fact that eve is more uncertain about bob s measurement outcomes if he uses inefficient detectors .",
    "now we have everything at hand to compute @xmath24 . for this",
    ", we resort to numerical calculations .",
    "we assume that our error correction can work as efficiently as the bidirectional protocol cascade @xcite .",
    "to be precise , we use a linear fit of the efficiency of cascade ( see table [ effcascade ] ) for the function @xmath84 in our numerical optimization .",
    ".[effcascade ] efficiency of cascade @xcite for different values of the error rate @xmath62 [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     formally , one - way communication would be needed to justify the use of the devetak - winter bound ( [ dev / win ] ) .",
    "however in the worst case scenario when using two - way communication , eve learns all positions where bob assigned the wrong bit - value . therefore the devetak - winter bound could still be applied if one additionally announces bob s error positions .",
    "but since eve s knowledge about the key ( [ entropyrho ] ) in the dr setting does not depend on bob s measurement outcome @xmath18 , the resulting key rate would remain unchanged .",
    "therefore two - way error correction methods can be applied directly in connection with dr methods in the lossy channel . in rr , however , strict one - way communication is essential .",
    "since we are here interested in efficiency considerations only , we ignore the problem of finding a practical one - way protocol that can be as efficient as cascade and simply assume we have such a protocol .",
    "still , we have to keep in mind that the rate for dr can be implemented directly with known protocols , whereas the rr rate requires the usage of efficient one - way error correction protocols .",
    "for given transmission @xmath1 of the quantum channel and excess noise @xmath0 imposed by bob s detector we    * choose an amplitude @xmath13 of alice s coherent signal states , * calculate @xmath96 for all information channels @xmath18 taking realistic error correction into account , * discard all channels where @xmath97 in postselection protocols , * integrate over the remaining channels to obtain the key rate @xmath98 , * start over such as to optimize over @xmath13 for a given transmission @xmath1 .",

    "the dotted line represents a postselected rr protocol with realistic error correction.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    if ideal error correction is assumed , the rr scheme clearly performs better than the postselected dr scheme . in this",
    "setting , an additional postselection step in the rr protocol can not improve the performance , since all information channels yield a positive advantage @xmath99 for alice and bob .",
    "the key rate for a non - postselected dr scheme is not shown , since it would be limited by 50% losses and is therefore not of interest for practical qkd .",
    "the key rate decreases significantly in the non - postselected rr protocols if one does not assume an ideal error correction .",
    "this is however not a problem of rr itself , but due to the fact that in the simple approach all bits have to be corrected .",
    "since one has to shrink the key by @xmath83 bits of information to correct a bit coming from a channel with error rate @xmath62 in a realistic scenario , it follows that the usage of information channels with high error rate @xmath62 effectively shrinks the key .",
    "using all information channels would completely negate the advantage of non - postselected rr versus postselected dr in a realistic scenario . as a remedy",
