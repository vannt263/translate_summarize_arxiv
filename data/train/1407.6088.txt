    "in quantum mechanics , spin is an intrinsic angular momentum , which is the inherent nature of elementary particles . electronic spin hall effect ( she ) is a transport phenomenon in which an electric field applied to spin particles results in a spin - dependent shift perpendicular to the electric field direction  @xcite .",
    "photons can be assigned with two opposite spin states with the spin axes parallel and anti - parallel to the wave vector , which correspond to left- and right - circular polarizations , respectively .",
    "photonic she , which is generally believed to be a result of topological spin - orbit interaction  @xcite , is just the photonic counterpart of the she in electronic system  @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction describes the coupling between the spin ( circular polarizations ) and orbital degrees of freedom of photons , which is the signature of two types of geometric phases : the rytov - vladimirskii - berry ( rvb ) phase and the pancharatnam - berry ( pb ) phase .",
    "the former is related to the evolution of the propagation direction of light  @xcite and the latter to the manipulation with the polarization state of light  @xcite .",
    "when a linearly polarized paraxial light beam impinges obliquely upon an interface between two different media , the spin - dependent splitting in real position space generates , which is associated with the rvb phase .",
    "this photonic she draws considerable attention in recent years due to its potential applications in precision metrology  @xcite and spin - based photonics  @xcite . however , the shift induced by the photonic she is very tiny , usually with the order of a fraction of the wavelength .",
    "weak measurement is a sensitive method to detect the photonic she  @xcite , which enlarges the original tiny displacement with preselection and postselection technology .",
    "recently , yin _ et .",
    "al . _ demonstrated experimentally a spin - dependent splitting in a thin metasurface with designed in - plane phase discontinuity at the wavelength scale , which is related to the rvb phase  @xcite . within their scheme ,",
    "opposite spin states accumulated at the opposite edge of the beam and constructed a spin - dependent splitting perpendicular to the designed phase gradient .",
    "while for an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium ( e.g. , liquid crystal q plate ) , the light beam can acquire the pb phase .",
    "the inhomogeneous anisotropic medium is usually be presented with rotational symmetry , which is expected to produce vortex beams or vector beams with great potential in microparticle manipulation and quantum information  @xcite . with rotational symmetry of the medium , the produced pb phase would also be locally varying and forms a geometric phase gradient in the azimuthal direction .",
    "actually , the pb phase is spin - dependent , that is , the spin of the incident photons determines the sign of the phase .",
    "however , if the incident light involves both spin components , these components would always superpose at the corresponding position due to the rotational symmetry , although they should have acquired just opposite pb phase . breaking the rotational symmetry ,",
    "it is likely to observe a spin - dependent splitting of light , i.e. , photonic she , due to the geometric phase gradient .",
    "it has been reported in a one - dimensional plasmonic chain , which can be viewed as breaking a rotationally symmetric structure from polar coordinate to the cartesian coordinate  @xcite .",
    "more recently , spin - dependent splitting in metasurfaces has been observed when the spatial inversion symmetry is violated  @xcite .",
    "the resulted photonic she is large enough for direct measurements , in contrast with the indirect detecting technology using the weak measurement .    in this work",
    ", we report the observation of photonic she in dielectric - based metasurfaces with rotational symmetry in which we break the rotational symmetry of pb phase by means of misaligning the central axes between the light beam and the metasurfaces . in recent years , metasurfaces is gaining a reputation for introducing a designed geometric phase  @xcite .",
    "the metasurfaces applied in this work are fabricated by etching locally varying grooves in a silica glass .",
    "as the optical dimension of the grooves is much less than the working wavelength , it creates a metasurface with inhomogeneous anisotropy due to the form birefringence  @xcite .",
    "it produces a spin - dependent angular splitting of light in the real position space as compared with the parallel splitting related to the rvb phase . suitably engineering the metasurface geometry",

    "the rotational symmetry can be broken by designing the metasurface structure , which just maintain part of the inner structure in comparing with the metasurface with rotational symmetry .",
    "the notations @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent left- and right - spin states respectively , and @xmath2 is rotation rate of metasurface structure.,width=302 ]    in order to get insight into the physical mechanism of the metasurface , jones calculus is performed here to analyze the polarization and phase transformation .",
    "the jones matrix of the metasurface with inhomogeneous local optical axes and constant retardation @xmath3 can be written as  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the local optical axis direction .",
    "when a right - circular ( @xmath6 ) or left - circular ( @xmath7 ) polarization beam normally impinges into the metasurface , the output state can be calculated as @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the right- and left - circular polarization , respectively .",
    "it is clear that an additional phase factor @xmath12 is induced in this process and its sign is spin - dependent .",
    "deriving from the conversion of polarization states , obviously , this additional phase is the pb phase in nature and depends only on the orientation of local optical axes . as the local optical axes varying with location , the passing beam will obtain a position - dependent pb phase .    when the metasurface be engineered with rotational symmetry [ fig .",

    ", both right- and left - circular polarizations ( spin states ) can acquire a helical phase . for different spin states , the helical phases are opposite , which would bent the wave vectors along the spin - dependent phase gradient as shown in fig .",
    ". however , the wave vectors of two spin states still overlap with each other in the real position space , so that there is no spin - dependent splitting in this situation [ fig .",
