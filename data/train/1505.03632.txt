    "heusler compounds and alloys are a huge family of intermetallic compounds@xcite and they owe their name to the german metallurgist friedrich heusler who in 1904 studied the thermodynamic properties of cu@xmath0mnal.@xcite the development of the research fields of magnetoelectronics and spintronics@xcite intensified the interest in the half - metallic heusler compounds.@xcite in half - metallic magnets a metallic majority - spin electronic band structure and a semiconducting minority - spin electronic band structure coexist.@xcite such compounds could lead to the creation of a fully spin - polarized current , maximizing the efficiency of spintronic devices.@xcite in addition , half - metallicity in heusler compounds is always accompanied by the so - called slater - pauling rule where the total spin magnetic moment scales linearly with the number of valence electrons in the unit cell.@xcite although a large number of half - metallic heusler compounds compounds has been studied , still novel properties are discovered among heusler alloys , e.g. ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic semiconducting behavior,@xcite paving the way for diverse applications in spintronics / magnetoelectronics.@xcite    a class of materials bridging the gap between half - metals and magnetic semiconductors are the so - called spin - gapless semiconductors ( sgs ) ; magnetic semiconductors where there is an almost zero - width energy gap at the fermi level in the majority - spin direction and a usual energy gap in the other spin - direction.@xcite in sgs ( i ) the mobility of carriers is considerably larger than in usual semiconductors , ( ii ) excited carriers include both electrons and holes which can be 100% spin - polarized simultaneously , and ( iii ) a vanishing amount of energy is enough to excite majority - spin electrons from the valence to the conduction band .",
    "several compounds have been identified as sgs,@xcite and among them exist a few heusler compounds,@xcite and it is mn@xmath0coal , an inverse full - heusler compound , which has attracted most of the attention due to its successful growth in the form of films .",

    "moreover electronic structure calculations yielded a ferrimagnetic state with a total spin magnetic moment of 1.95 @xmath3 per formula unit and an antiparallel coupling between the mn nearest - neighboring atoms.@xcite although the calculated structure in ref .",

    "using a different electronic structure method.@xcite they have also calculated the exchange constants showing that they are short range and the magnetic state is stabilized mainly due to the direct interaction between nearest - neighbors and predicted a curie temperature of 890 k.@xcite but it was not until 2013 , when ouardi et al identified the sgs behavior of mn@xmath0coal and have confirmed it experimentally in bulk - like pollycrystalline films.@xcite the experimental lattice constant was found to be 5.798  , the curie temperature was measured to be about 720 k and the total spin magnetic moment per formula unit was found 2 @xmath3 at a temperature of 5 k.@xcite following this research work , jamer and collaborators have grown thin films of 70 nm thickness on top of gaas,@xcite but these films were found to deviate from the sgs behavior.@xcite on the contrary , films -grown on top of a thermally oxidized si substrate- were found to be sgs with a curie temperature of 550 k.@xcite first - principles calculations of skaftouros et al identified among the inverse heusler compounds four additional potential sgs materials : ti@xmath0cosi , ti@xmath0mnal , ti@xmath0vas and cr@xmath0znsi , the latter three being also fully - compensated ferrimagnets , and v@xmath6al for which one v sublattice is not magnetic and the other two form a conventional antiferromagnet.@xcite the sgs character of ti@xmath0mnal was also confirmed by jia _ _ et al.__@xcite wollman _ _ et al.__@xcite confirmed the conclusion of meinert _ et al . _ that direct exchange interactions are responsible for the magnetic order in mn@xmath0coal studying a wide range of mn@xmath0-based heusler compounds and predicted a curie temperature of 740 k using the spherical approximation.@xcite skaftouros _",

    "we employ density - functional theory at the ground state augmented by a heisenberg model hamiltonian for the prediction of the temperature dependent magnetization .",

    ", authors studied the formation enthalpies for 810 heusler compounds and concluded that the formation of the compounds is not favored with respect to the constituent elements only in the case where the heavier main - group metals such as thallium , lead and bismuth are involved .",
    "thus we expect the compounds under study to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "all five compounds under study are called inverse heuslers and crystallize in the so - called xa or x@xmath7 structure , the prototype of which is cuhg@xmath0ti , but usually the sequence of the atoms follows the chemical formula x@xmath0yz .",
    "x and y are transition metal atoms with the valence of x being smaller than y , and z is a sp atom . a schematic representation of the structure is given in fig . [ structure ] .",
    "there are four atoms along the diagonal of the cube following the sequence x - x - y - z and thus the two x atoms sit at sites of different symmetry .",
    "we use the superscripts a and b to distinguish them .",
    "as shown also in the figure , each atom at the a or c site resides at the center of a cube with nearest neighbors four b sites and four d sites sitting at the corners of the cube ; equivalently each atom at a b or d site has four atoms at a sites and four atoms at c sites as nearest neighbors .",
    "concerning the next - nearest neighbors each a site has as second neighbors six c sites ( and each c site has six a sites as second neighbors ) , and equivalent is the situation for the b and d sites .",
    "the environment of each site is important for the discussion of the magnetic properties of these compounds .",
    "we have used the lattice constants determined in ref .",
    "using the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis band structure scheme ( fplo)@xcite with the gga exchange - correlation potential.@xcite for mn@xmath0coal the calculated value of 5.73   is slightly smaller than the experimentally determined lattice constants of 5.8388 and 5.798   in refs . and , respectively .",
    "we compute the ground state electronic properties using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method as implemented in the ` fleur ` code @xcite combined with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange - correlation potential as parameterized by perdew _",
    "et al_.@xcite      next we present the formalism on which the calculations of the exchange constants are based .",
    "our starting point is the classical heisenberg model with unit vectors @xmath8 , pointing along the spin moments at positions @xmath9 specified by a cell index @xmath10 and magnetic lattice index @xmath11 .",
    "the spin moments interact via exchange coupling parameters @xmath12 and the exchange hamiltonian @xmath13 is @xmath14 note that the magnitude of the moments is incorporated in the parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the exchange parameters are extracted by a least square fit from ab - initio total energy calculations performed using the fleur code for a set of spin spirals with randomized wave - vectors.@xcite to reduce the computational cost we do non - self consistent calculations and apply the approximation based on the magnetic force theorem@xcite to obtain the total energy differences from the differences in sums of eigenvalues . in order to obtain the adiabatic magnon",
    "dispersion,@xcite we set up the spin - wave dynamical matrix @xmath16 at a brillouin zone point @xmath17 and solve for eigenvalues which provides the magnon frequencies : @xmath18 @xmath19\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the integrated magnetic moment of sub - lattice @xmath11 . in order to obtain the spin - stiffness @xmath21 of the compounds we fit a linear or quadratic form @xmath22 or @xmath23 respectively to the adiabatic magnon energies along a high symmetry line in the neighborhood of the @xmath24-point ( in cubic systems , @xmath21 is isotropic ) .",
    "a linear behavior is present for the conventional antiferromagnets and we find it here for the compensated ferrimagnets .",
    "we should also note that within our formalism , where we consider an adiabatic approach for the magnons , we can not study the landau damping of the spin - waves induced by electron - hole excitations .",
    "in the compounds under study we expect the adiabatic approximation to provide reasonable results since there is a stoner gap separating the magnon spectra from the continuum stoner excitation spectra as in most half - metallic magnets ( with the exception when the fermi level is exactly at the higher energy edge of the minority - spin energy gap ) .",
    "we employ the classical monte carlo technique to calculate the temperature dependence of the magnetization that is derived from the heisenberg exchange hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) .",
    "the technique provides an excellent estimation of the critical temperature , @xmath26 , from the position of the peak of the susceptibility as a function of temperature calculated as @xmath27/k_bt$ ] , where @xmath28 denotes thermal averaging over monte carlo steps , @xmath29 is the magnetization ( before averaging ) , and @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "use of a correction for finite - size effects , e.g. the fourth - order cumulant method,@xcite can give a more accurate estimation of the critical temperature , but the correction here is small ( of the order of a few k ) since we are using large simulation supercells ( @xmath31 primitive cells corresponding to 5184 magnetic atoms ) .",
    "we employ the metropolis algorithm@xcite and as a random number generator we use the mersene twister.@xcite the input comprises both the inter - sublattice and intra - sublattice exchange constants considering only the magnetic atoms , neglecting any contribution due to the interaction of the low - moment sp atoms .",
    "moreover we ignore the contribution of the interstitial region.@xcite    from the exchange constants the curie critical temperature @xmath1 can be also estimated within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "actually , the critical temperature is given by the average value of the magnon energies which in mfa is the arithmetic average taking all the magnon values with equal weight .",
    "thus is an arithmetic property that the mfa estimation is larger than experimental values @xcite .",
    "the mfa expression of the critical temperature for a multi  sublattice material like heusler compounds has been provided in literature . @xcite .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in the first part",
    "we discuss the ground state properties and magnetic moments of the studied compounds .",
    "the second part deals with the exchange interactions , spin - wave dispersions , as well as spin stiffness constants .",
    "the last part focusses on the temperature dependence of the magnetization and critical temperature .",
    "note that ti@xmath0cosi presents similar behavior to mn@xmath0coal and ti@xmath0vas presents similar properties to ti@xmath0mnal .",
    "thus we will focus our discussion mainly on mn@xmath0coal , ti@xmath0mnal , and cr@xmath0znsi compounds .     -0.3",
    "cm      the first step in the study of these materials is to establish their ground state properties at 0 k as obtained from our first - principles calculations . in fig .",
    "[ dos ] we have plotted the density of states ( dos ) projected on the transition metal atoms for mn@xmath0coal , ti@xmath0mnal and cr@xmath0znsi and in table [ table1 ] we present the atomic and total spin magnetic moments for all five compounds .",
    "we do not present band structure plots since they are known from previous works.@xcite in all studied compounds we get a finite gap in the minority - spin band structure ( negative values of dos ) and a zero - width gap in the majority - spin band structure . in the case of mn@xmath0coal and",
    "cr@xmath0znsi the fermi level is located at the middle of the minority - spin energy gap and for ti@xmath0mnal the fermi level is located at the left edge of the gap .",
    "the position of the fermi level within the gap is important with respect to the coupling between collective and single electron excitations discussed later .",
    "for all five compounds under study the total dos per formula unit ( f.u . )",
    "is similar to the ones calculated in ref . with a different full - potential method and",
    "thus spin - gapless semiconducting behavior of these compounds is a robust prediction of ab - initio electronic structure calculations .    .calculated atom - resolved and total spin magnetic moments ( in @xmath3 ) for the five spin - gapless semiconducting inverse heusler compounds under study having the chemical formula x@xmath0yz .",
    "the superscripts a and b distinguish the two inequivalent x atoms ; we present the sum of the z spin moment and the interstitial spin magnetic moments ; @xmath32 stands for the sum of the absolute atomic spin magnetic moments . note that we have used the equilibrium lattice constants as calculated in ref . .",

    "negative values of the exchange constants reflect an antiferromagnetic coupling of the corresponding spin moments and positive values a ferromagnetic coupling . in all compounds",
    "the inter - sublattice nearest neighbor interactions dominate and especially the interaction between the x@xmath33 atom and its x@xmath34 and y nearest neighbors ( fig.[structure ] ) . the interactions between next - nearest neighbors x@xmath34 and y are expectedly weaker . in the case of cr@xmath0znsi",
    "the zn atom is almost non magnetic while in the case of mn@xmath0coal the intra - sublattice exchange constants between the mn@xmath34-mn@xmath34 atoms have a sizeable value despite their large distance . in the case of ti@xmath0mnal ,",
    "the ti@xmath35 have positive spin moments and the mn@xmath36 has negative spin moment as shown in table[table1 ] .",
    "the situation is different to mn@xmath0coal where mn@xmath34 site has negative , and mn@xmath33 site and co@xmath36 have positive moments .",
    "thus the x@xmath34-x@xmath33 and x@xmath33-y interactions have different signs for the two compounds .",
    "we can conclude that for the sgss under study the interactions are short range : as seen from the fig.[exchconst ] they decay quickly with the distance .",
    "this can be attributed to the existence of the finite spin - gap as discussed in literature in detail for half metallic heusler compounds.@xcite    the short range nature of exchange interaction in mn@xmath0coal and similar compounds has been shown by meinert and collaborators in ref .. moreover , in the case of mn@xmath0coal our results agree very well with the results obtained in ref .",

    "our results confirm the conclusions drawn in the previous paragraph .",
    "the on - site inter - sublattice @xmath38 are considerably larger than the intra - sublattice @xmath38 and only in the case of mn@xmath0coal and ti@xmath0vas the @xmath39 and @xmath40 makes a considerable contribution into the total exchange field with different signs .",

    "each spectrum has distinct features .",
    "first , the number of branches coincides with the number of magnetic atoms in the unit cell and thus we have three branches for mn@xmath0coal and ti@xmath0mnal and two branches for cr@xmath0znsi where the zn atom is not magnetic .",
    "the energy dispersion curves of all compounds under study are typical for magnets with short range interactions , where nearest - neighbors and next - nearest - neighbors interactions dominate , and do not yield any instabilities .",
    "instabilities can occur if the acoustic magnon modes have very low energies ( close to zero ) in some parts of the brillouin zone but this is not the case for any of the studied compounds .",
    "in the case of mn@xmath0coal the acoustic branch shows a typical behavior of ferro / ferrimagnets and around the @xmath41 point the energy - dispersion curve shows a quadratic behavior with a spin - wave stiffness constant @xmath21 of 677 mev@xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "this value exceeds typical values of transition metal ferromagnets which usually range between 300 and 600 mev@xmath42@xmath43,@xcite and is close to the maximum known values of 715 mev@xmath42@xmath43 for co@xmath0fesi@xcite and 800 mev@xmath42@xmath43 for fe@xmath44co@xmath45.@xcite ti@xmath0cosi as shown in table [ table2 ] exhibits a @xmath21 value of 636 mev@xmath42@xmath43 close to the value for mn@xmath0coal .",
    "although cr@xmath0znsi is not a true antiferromagnet , around the @xmath41 point the energy dispersion is linear and the optical and acoustic branch coincide showing considerable difference only at the plateau close to the brillouin zone boundary ( x , w , l , k points in fig .",
    "[ magnons ] ) .",
    "the spin - wave stiffness constant as shown in table[table2 ] takes a value of 752 mev@xmath42 .",
    "in the case of ti@xmath0mnal the situation is more complicated . due to the small spin moments of the ti atoms around the @xmath41 point",
    "the energy - dispersion of the acoustic magnon is practically linear but with a small value of the @xmath21 constant ( 274 mev@xmath42 ) .",
    "ti@xmath0vas also shows a behavior similar to ti@xmath0mnal but now @xmath21 has a much higher value of 598 mev@xmath42 .",
    "-0.2 cm    in this section we show the temperature dependence of the magnetization and susceptibility calculated with the classical monte - carlo technique . in fig .",
    "[ mvst ] we present for mn@xmath0coal , ti@xmath0mnal and cr@xmath0znsi the temperature dependence of the sublattice and total magnetization per f.u .",
    "first , we compare our results to experiment .",
    "we plot for mn@xmath0coal our theoretical results together with the experimental results from the ref . where the temperature dependence of the total magnetization in a pollycrystalline film was measured in a field of 1 t.",
    "the agreement between the two data sets is good with one curve falling on top of the other with the exception of the region close to the critical temperature .",
    "our curve shows an abrupt decrease close to our calculated critical temperature of 770 k , while in experiments this sharp decrease is shifted lower in temperature since the measured critical temperature in ref .",
    "is 720 k , slightly smaller than our value .",
    "thus the monte - carlo technique , which we employ , accurately describes the temperature dependence of the magnetization , indicating also the accurate determination of the exchange constants .    in the case of cr@xmath0znsi",
    ", the picture is that of an antiferromagnet with a total spin magnetic moment being almost equal to zero for all temperatures , since we have ignored the magnetic properties of the zn atom . in the case of ti@xmath0mnal the calculated total magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ mvst ] ) is not exactly zero as expected from the first - principles result at 0 k ( table[table1 ] ) but it equals to @xmath470.46 @xmath48 due to the spin moment of the al atom and of the interstitial region which we have ignored in our monte - carlo calculations . at and",
    "close to room temperature ( up to @xmath49  k ) , where most devices operate , we find that all three compounds still have sizeable values of the sublattice magnetization . thus the magnetic properties are not deteriorated although the spin - gapless behavior could be lost at this elevated temperature .",
    "for example for mn@xmath0coal at 0 k the mn@xmath34 , mn@xmath33 and co atoms show a sublattice magnetization of about @xmath50 , 2.6 and 1.0 @xmath3 respectively . at room temperature ,",
    "these values become @xmath51 , 2.3 and 0.8 @xmath3 , showing an absolute - value decrease of 13% , 11% and 18% , respectively .",
    "the total magnetization per f.u .",
    "decreases from 2.0 @xmath3 at 0 k to 1.8 @xmath3 at room temperature showing an even smaller decrease of 10 % . thus the compounds under study are adequate to be employed in spintronic / magnetoelectronic devices .    to estimate the critical temperature @xmath26 within the monte - carlo technique we have plotted in fig.[xvst ] the susceptibility @xmath52 versus the temperature for all compounds under study .",
    "obtained values are presented in table[table2 ] and compared with the mean - field estimation of the critical temperature @xmath53 . as seen for all compounds @xmath26 is much lower than the @xmath53 .",
    "the difference ranges from 110 k for ti@xmath0vas up to 364 k for mn@xmath0coal , while for the other compounds it is around 220 - 270 k. note that within mfa , the critical temperature is given by the arithmetic average of all the magnon energy values with equal weight . in reality",
    "low - energy magnons have more weight in determining the critical temperature and mfa usually overestimates experimental data by more than 20%.@xcite the monte - carlo determined critical temperature does not suffer from this drawback and thus it is expected to approach the experimental values of the critical temperature .",
    "-0.2 cm    in some magnetic compounds , an empirical trend is observed that the critical temperature increases with the magnitude of the local magnetic moments.@xcite this trend is not observed here .",
    "the sum of absolute local moments ( see table [ table1 ] ) is largest for mn@xmath0coal being 5.29 @xmath3 but the critical temperature is largest for cr@xmath0znsi for which this sum is only 3.34 @xmath3 .",
    "intuitively we can explain this observation as follows .",
    "the critical temperature depends both ( a ) on the nature of the spin - dependent wavefunction overlap and chemical bonds between nearest neighbors , which is a short - range property and is independent of the magnitude of the spin moments , as well as ( b ) the more distant interactions which are formed largely because of susceptibility effects ( one atom polarizes the fermi surface electrons and this is felt by a distant atom through the electron propagation ) which largely depend on the magnitude of the spin magnetic moments . here , since the nearest - neighbor interactions are dominant and the long - range ones practically vanish , ( a ) applies but not ( b ) .",
    "finally , we compare our values for @xmath1 with experimental and theoretical results on mn@xmath0coal compound . our calculated mfa and monte - carlo values are 1134 k and 770 k , respectively .",
    "meinert and collaborators @xcite estimated theoretically a @xmath54  k , smaller than our mfa result .",
    "wollman and collaborators@xcite calculated @xmath55  k , in - between our value and the value in ref . and within the more accurate spherical approximation ( spa)@xcite a value of 740 k , close to our monte - carlo value of 770 k.@xcite experimentally , for the bulk - like pollycrystalline film , ouardi and collaborators measure for the @xmath1 a value of 720 k,@xcite while the experiments by xu and collaborators on thin films of mn@xmath0coal gave a @xmath1 value of about 550 k;@xcite this discrepancy is expected since films present critical temperatures significantly smaller that the bulk samples .",
    "thus our monte - carlo value of 770 k is in good agreement both with the spa calculated value of 740 k of wollmann _ _ et al.__@xcite and with the experimental value of 720 k measured by ouardi _",

    "<S> employing first principles electronic structure calculations in conjunction with the frozen - magnon method we calculate exchange interactions , spin - wave dispersion , and spin - wave stiffness constants in inverse - heusler - based spin gapless semiconductor ( sgs ) compounds mn@xmath0coal , ti@xmath0mnal , cr@xmath0znsi , ti@xmath0cosi and ti@xmath0vas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that their magnetic behavior is similar to the half - metallic ferromagnetic full - heusler alloys , i.e. , the intersublattice exchange interactions play an essential role in the formation of the magnetic ground state and in determining the curie temperature , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> all compounds , except ti@xmath0cosi possess a ferrimagnetic ground state . due to the finite energy gap in one spin channel , the exchange interactions decay sharply with the distance , and hence magnetism of these sgss can be described considering only nearest and next - nearest neighbor exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spin - wave dispersion curves are typical for ferrimagnets and ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - wave stiffness constants turn out to be larger than those of the elementary 3@xmath2-ferromagnets . calculated exchange parameters </S>",
    "<S> are used as input to determine the temperature dependence of the magnetization and @xmath1 of the sgss . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath1 of all compounds is much above the room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated magnetization curve for mn@xmath0coal as well as the curie temperature are in very good agreement with available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the present study is expected to pave the way for a deeper understanding of the magnetic properties of the inverse - heusler - based sgss and enhance the interest in these materials for application in spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices . </S>"
