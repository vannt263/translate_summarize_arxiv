    "lattice models of the fluid - solid phase transition have been studied for many years @xcite .",

    "analyzing athermal lattice models of this kind is relevant not only to the equilibrium melting transition , but to modeling diffusion in dense fluids , glassy dynamics , disordered solids , and granular materials .    in the simplest lattice gas models ,",
    "the fluid - solid transition is continuous .",
    "thus the model with nearest - neighbor exclusion on bipartite lattices belongs to the ising universality class , while the corresponding model on the triangular lattice - the hard - hexagon model - has a transition in the @xmath3 potts universality class @xcite .",
    "lattice gases with extended exclusion regions on the square lattice were recently studied by fernandes et al .",
    "for exclusion of up to @xmath4-th neighbors , these authors found , for @xmath5 to 5 , that the fluid - solid transition is discontinuous for @xmath6 and 5 , and continuous in the other cases .",
    "what causes the transition to be continuous or not is as yet unclear .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study further examples , with the goal of identifying which features of a model determine the nature of the phase transition .",
    "considerable attention has also been given to lattice dimer models , in which each molecule occupies a pair of adjacent sites .",
    "in the two - dimensional case the model represents adsorption of diatomic molecules on a crystalline surface , which has motivated extensive study @xcite .",
    "( a complete review of this literature is not feasible here ; the interested reader will find further references in the papers cited . ) for purely on - site excluded - volume interactions , it is known that no phase transition occurs @xcite .",
    "inclusion of nearest - neighbor or longer - range interactions , whether attractive or repulsive , may lead to the appearance of new phases .",
    "in addition to transitions between fluid phases of high and low density ( as in the monomer lattice gas ) , phases with periodic structure may also arise .",

    "this monte carlo simulation method has proved to be efficient and reliable in studies of continuous phase transitions in spin models and lattice gases @xcite .",
    "thus a further motivation for the present study is to assess the utility of tomographic sampling for discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "the results confirm that the method is indeed useful in this context : a single set of simulations enables one to calculate the thermodynamic properties ( including the pressure and the absolute entropy ) , as continuous functions of the chemical potential , without metastability effects .",
    "detailed comparison with theoretical predictions for finite - size scaling at a discontinuous phase transition confirm the reliability of the simulation method , and lend support to the idea that the nature of the phase transition is in part determined by the symmetry of the close - packed state .",

    "<S> detailed simulations using tomographic entropic sampling show that as the chemical potential is varied , there is a strongly discontinuous phase transition , at which the particle density jumps by about 18% of its maximum value , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is accompanied by the onset of orientational order , to an arrangement corresponding to the @xmath1 structure identified by phares et al . </S>",

    "<S> is verified in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuous transition can be understood qualitatively given that the model possesses eight equivalent maximum - density configurations , so that its coarse - grained description corresponds to that of the @xmath2 potts model . </S>"
