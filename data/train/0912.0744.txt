    "early - type galaxies host the majority of the baryonic mass observed in galaxies in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; hence , deciphering the processes that lead to their formation and the mechanisms that rule their subsequent evolution is a key cosmological issue . for instance",
    ", it is still debated whether early - type galaxies form at relatively high redshift ( @xmath7 ) as a result of a global starburst and then passively evolve to the present ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or whether they assemble from mutual disruption of disks in merging events ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "information with which to distinguish these scenarios lies in the characteristics of galaxy dark - matter halos",
    ". however , the lack of suitable and easily interpreted kinematical tracers , such as hi in spirals , has made comprehensive studies on the dark matter component in early - type galaxies rather difficult ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the last few years",
    ", strong gravitational lensing has allowed astrophysicists to make great progress in the understanding of the internal structure of early - type galaxies . through lensing ,",
    "it has become possible to address in detail some fundamental problems related to the mechanisms of formation of early - type galaxies , like the determination of the amount and distribution of dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or the investigation of the total mass density profile and its redshift evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several algorithms have been developed in order to fit the observational data of a strong gravitational lens system and , thus , to reconstruct the properties of a lens .",
    "simplifying , a first difference between codes is the use of a parametric model ( e.g. , _ _",
    "gravlens__keeton / gravlens/ ] , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or a non - parametric model ( e.g. , _ _ pixelens _ _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to describe the mass distribution of a lens . in the former case ,",
    "the mass distribution of a lens is assumed to be accurately described by an analytical expression ; the fundamental scales of the model are determined by comparing the observed and model - predicted properties of the multiple images . in the latter case , a pixelated map or a multipole decomposition of the surface mass density of the lens",
    "is usually estimated through a statistical analysis that requires , in addition to the observational information , some extra physically plausible constraints , called priors , on the surface mass density distribution ( e.g. , positive - definite and smooth ) of the lens .",
    "on the one hand , parametric models provide a great deal of freedom and complexity , but they do not cover `` naturally '' all the possible realistic mass distributions ( for instance , surface mass density distributions with twisting isodensity contours ) ; on the other hand , even if non - parametric models are more general , their number of degrees of freedom is often much larger than the constraints and this can result in three - dimensional density distributions that are dynamically unrealistic or unstable .",
    "a viable solution to obtain physically significant density distributions is to consider a framework where the mass distribution of the lens is reconstructed by combining in a fully self - consistent way both gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "diameter centered on the lens galaxy.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    lensing codes are further distinguished by the fact that the multiple images and the corresponding sources can be modeled as point - like ( e.g. , _ gravlens _ ; _ pixelens _ ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or extended ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) objects . in the context of point - like algorithms , the best - fit model is defined as that which minimizes the chi - square between the measured positions of the centroids of the images and the positions reproduced by the model , weighted by the measurement uncertainties .",
    "additional chi - square terms that quantify the agreement between the observed and model - predicted relative fluxes and time delays of the multiple images can also be included . for extended algorithms , the goodness of a model",
    "is estimated by comparing on a pixelated grid the image surface brightness morphology and distribution which are observed to those which are reproduced by the model ( after convolution with the relevant point spread function ) .",
    "the relative positions of a multiply imaged system can sometimes be measured with an accuracy of a few milli - arcseconds ( e.g. , @xcite ) and these positions represent the most important constraints on the mass distribution of the lens .",
    "in fact , although the flux ratios of the multiple images can be easily estimated and offer another important source of information , the sensitivity of the flux measurements to details such as the dark matter substructure of the lens , the extinction in the interstellar medium of the lens , the microlensing effects of the stars present in the lens , and the time variability in the source decrease their potential .",
    "time delays can also help to determine the mass distribution of a lens , but a statistically significant number of measurements of this kind is just starting to become available .         ccccccccccc ra & dec & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 + ( j2000 ) & ( j2000 ) & & & ( deg ) & ( ) & ( mag ) & ( mag ) & ( mag ) & ( mag ) & ( mag ) + 15:38:12.92 & + 58:17:09.8 & 0.143 & 0.82 & 157.3 & 1.58 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 +    @xcite .",

    "the amount of mass present in a lens galaxy in the forms of dark and visible matter can be determined ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to projected total mass , lensing analyses allow one to estimate also the total mass density profile of lens galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this can be achieved either by combining in a statistical way lensing and stellar dynamics data in a sample of lens galaxies that are assumed to have a homologous structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) , by performing a joint lensing and extended stellar kinematics study in a single lens galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , or by using lensing only in exceptional lensing systems that show multiple images of different sources probing wide angular and radial ranges of the lens mass distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    "the excellent angular resolution of the hst allows us to identify two systems of multiple images ( for labels , see fig .",

    "this fact would imply approximately the same redshift for the two sources , if the lens total mass were close to an isothermal distribution .",
    "in addition , the absence in the sdss spectrum of evident emission lines at a possible third redshift supports the hypothesis that the two sources are at the same distance to the observer .",
    "since the precise knowledge of the redshift of the two sources plays a crucial role in the determination of the total mass distribution of the lens galaxy , we decided to perform additional spectroscopic measurements to understand whether the emission lines observed in the sdss spectrum are associated to one or both of the lensed sources .",
    "the data were obtained on june 25 , 2009 as a fast - track observing program ( p38 - 428 ) with the andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) at the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma ( spain ) .",

    "these are obtained by extracting the image positions and fluxes from gaussian distributions centered on the measured values and with standard deviations equal to the observational errors reported in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "in addition , starting from the sets of optimized parameter values , we estimate the total projected mass @xmath72 enclosed within seven different circular apertures of radii @xmath73 . the first three radii",
    "are chosen as the projected distances from the lens galaxy center of the inner image of the double system , the `` average '' einstein circle , and the outer image of the double system .",

    "( [ eq01 ] ) and ( [ eq02 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the strong anti - correlation between the value of the length scale and the steepness ( see the fifth panel of fig .

    "the projected total mass estimates obtained with _",
    "pixelens _ are systematically larger than those obtained with _ gravlens_.",
    "this can be caused by a combination of the mass - sheet degeneracy ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) and the prior on the positive definiteness of every pixel of the grid of the total surface mass density .",
    "among all the arbitrary constants that can be added to the convergence @xmath88 , leaving though the image positions unchanged , those which provide a negative value of @xmath88 somewhere on the grid are excluded , _ a priori _ , from the non - parametric lensing analysis .",
    "this fact may bias the projected total mass measurements to slightly larger values .",
    "as far as @xmath59 is concerned , the larger uncertainty coming from the non - parametric reconstruction with respect to the parametric one is probably just a consequence of the more general allowed models .",
    "a bias towards small values of @xmath59 may be associated to the prior present in _",
    "pixelens _ that constrains the value of @xmath88 on one pixel of the grid to be lower than twice the average value of the neighboring pixels . for large values of @xmath59 , two adjacent pixels located in the central region of the lens may have very different values of @xmath88 , hence these models",
    "may not be included in the statistical ensemble .    finally , we remark on the overall agreement between the lensing only and lensing plus dynamics probability distributions of @xmath59 .",

    "<S> we investigate the total ( luminous and dark ) mass distribution of the lens between 1 and 4 kpc from the galaxy center by means of parametric and non - parametric lensing codes that describe the multiple images as point - like objects . </S>",
    "<S> bootstrapping and bayesian analyses are performed to determine the uncertainties on the quantities relevant to the lens mass characterization . </S>",
    "<S> several disparate lensing models provide results that are consistent , given the errors , with those obtained from the best - fit model of the lens mass distribution in terms of a singular power law ellipsoid model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the lensing models agree on : ( 1 ) reproducing accurately the observed positions of the images ; ( 2 ) predicting a nearly axisymmetric total mass distribution , centered and oriented as the light distribution ; ( 3 ) measuring a value of @xmath2 for the total mass projected within the einstein radius of 2.5 kpc ; ( 4 ) estimating a total mass density profile slightly steeper than an isothermal one [ @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a fit of the sloan digital sky survey multicolor photometry with composite stellar population models provides a value of @xmath4 for the total mass of the galaxy in the form of stars and of @xmath5 for the fraction of projected luminous over total mass enclosed inside the einstein radius . by combining lensing ( total ) and photometric ( luminous ) mass measurements , we differentiate the lens mass content in terms of luminous and dark matter components </S>",
    "<S> this two - component modeling , which is viable only in extraordinary systems like sdss j1538 + 5817 , leads to a description of the global properties of the galaxy dark matter halo . extending these results to a larger number of lens galaxies would improve considerably our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution processes in the @xmath6cdm scenario . </S>"
