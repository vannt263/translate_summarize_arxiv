    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binaries in which a roche lobe filling k or m dwarf secondary transfers matter onto a white dwarf ( wd ) primary ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) make up a subclass of cvs which is characterized by semiperiodic outbursts caused by episodic accretion of stored gas onto the wd ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , see cannizzo 1993a for a review ) .",
    "u geminorum is one of the two prototypical dwarf novae , the other one being ss cygni .",
    "u gem was the first cv to be discovered ( in 1855 by john russell hind of bishop s observatory , london ) , and is among the better studied .",
    "it has an orbital period of 4.25 hr , a primary mass @xmath8 , secondary mass @xmath9 , and inclination @xmath10 ( krzeminski 1965 , smak 1971 , 1976 , warner & nather 1971 , sion et al .",
    "1998 , long & gilliland 1999 ) .",
    "krzeminski ( 1965 ) showed u gem to be an eclipsing binary system , and warner & nather ( 1971 ) and independently smak ( 1971 ) developed the now standard model for nonmagnetic cvs , with u gem as the prototype .",
    "( the inference on orbital inclination comes from the fact that the disk is eclipsed , but not the wd . )",
    "u gem also has a reliable distance @xmath11 pc determined from _ hst _ astrometric parallax ( harrison et al .",
    "the mean recurrence time for outbursts in u gem is @xmath12 d , during which time it brightens from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( szkody & mattei 1984 ) .",
    "the outburst durations in u gem follow a bimodal distribution as with other dne .",
    "the alternation of long and short outbursts has been shown to be a natural consequence of the accretion disk limit cycle model ( buat - menard et al .",
    "the outbursts last typically either @xmath15 d or @xmath16 d ( measured through @xmath17 on the rising and decaying branches ) .",
    "there was , however , one notable exception to this : in october 1985 a long outburst occurred which lasted @xmath18 d. this long duration is interesting from the standpoint of the accretion disk limit cycle theory which provides the theoretical underpinnings for our current understanding of dwarf nova outbursts . according to theory , a decrease in the light output from the disk can occur in one of two ways : ( 1 ) one can have the entire disk completely in a hot , ionized state , and have the mass and concomitant mass accretion rate decrease by virtue of loss of disk material onto the wd @xmath7 a `` viscous '' decay , or ( 2 ) a cooling front can sweep through the disk from outside to inside and revert the disk back to a neutral gas , with very low viscosity , that does not accrete appreciably @xmath7 a `` thermal '' decay .",
    "the ratio of the times between these two time scale is roughly @xmath19 , the ratio of a local pressure scale height to radius .",
    "for some reason ( which would be difficult to uniquely identify ) , the cooling front in the oct 1985 outburst was delayed for much longer than usual , thereby forcing the entire disk to remain in the hot , ionized state and to continue accreting slowly onto the wd .",
    "although the `` fast '' decays during which the cooling front traverses the disk have been extensively studied in dwarf novae , and in fact form the basis for the `` bailey '' relation which provides our only direct measure of the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) @xmath20 parameter for ionized gas , the long outbursts seen in the well - studied long orbital systems such as u gem and ss cyg do not exhibit enough dynamic range in flux to be able to determine a time scale for the slowly decaying portion of the light curve .",
    "the term `` viscous plateau '' has been used for the slow decays to convey the fact that the flux is roughly constant ( cannizzo 1993b ) .",
    "for instance , an analysis of the long term aavso light curve of ss cyg reveals no `` outlier '' outburst of anomalously long duration ( see fig . 2 of cannizzo & mattei 1992 ) like the oct 1985 u gem outburst .",
    "this is significant given that the cannizzo & mattei study covers @xmath21 times more outbursts than in the current u gem study . only in the `` superoutbursts '' of the su uma subclass of dne",
    "can the slow decay time scale be reliably determined ( e.g. , cannizzo 2001b presents a study of the 2001 superoutburst of wz sge ) .",
    "the october 1985 outburst of u gem appears to be the only non - su uma - type event ever observed for which one can also make this determination and therefore `` test '' ( in one limited way ) the prevailing paradigm for viscous and thermal decays in accretion disks .",
    "froning et al . ( 2001 ) present _ fuse _ observations of u gem at three times near outburst maximum and one near quiescence . from their spectral",
    "fitting they derive a rate of accretion in the disk near maximum of @xmath22 . at this rate , a total mass of @xmath23 g",
    "would be accreted in 35 d , the approximate duration of the viscous plateau for the outburst of current interest .",
    "if roughly half of the mass in the disk at the start of the outburst is accreted onto the wd during the outburst , this implies an initial disk mass of @xmath24 g. for an outer disk radius ( determined by the orbital period and wd mass ) of @xmath25 cm , this gives a surface density at the outer disk edge of @xmath3 g @xmath4 at the start of an outburst , for a quasi - steady disk in which @xmath26 .    the controlling ( i.e. , slowest ) time scale in a quasi - steady disk without transition fronts",
    "is the viscous time scale at the outer edge @xmath27 .",
    "one can obtain a simple estimate of @xmath27 by using the `` vertically - averaged '' equations which give the radial disk structure ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "in qualitative terms , the viscous time scale depends on the dimensions of the disk , on the amount of stored gas , and on the viscosity parameter @xmath20 .",
    "[ a6 ] of cannizzo & reiff ( 1992 ) gives the midplane disk temperature @xmath28 , where the keplerian frequency @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the value of alpha in the outbursting disk ( @xmath31 , smak 1984 , 1998 ) .",
    "if we adopt an opacity law for the ionized state @xmath32 g @xmath4 @xmath33 and use the condition of local hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the local sound speed , @xmath6 is the local disk semi - thickness , @xmath36 the ideal gas constant , and @xmath37 the mean molecular weight @xmath38 ) , we then get for the viscous time    @xmath39 d @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 g @xmath44 ,    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 cm ) .",
    "the viscous time scale @xmath47 represents an @xmath48folding time over which local surface density perturbations at a given radius are smoothed out in a dynamically evolving disk .",
    "this scaling predicts that if the depletion of disk mass were large enough , one should see a flattening in the decay light curve , given that @xmath49 .",
    "we examined the long term aavso light curve of u gem from 1908 to 2002 which consists of over 51,000 observations in the aavso international database from observers worldwide .",
    "figure 1 presents the frequency histogram distribution for the outburst durations , measured from @xmath50 on the rising and declining portions of outburst .",
    "u gem lies in the plane of the ecliptic so that there are yearly sun gaps in the data .",
    "we omit from our analysis outbursts that straddle a sun gap , or that contain any gap of more than 4 d. as with other dne , one can see the characteristic bimodal distribution of outburst durations . figure 2 shows the @xmath51 data from the aavso of u gem during a 140 d span beginning at jd 2446320 ( i.e. , 12.5 sep 1985 ) .",
    "this interval covers the @xmath52 d of the outburst , as well as the following short outburst .",
    "the duration of the oct 1985 outburst exceeded by about a factor of 2 the second longest one .",
    "the two straight lines have slopes of 26 d mag@xmath1 and 1.4 d mag@xmath1 , respectively . according to theory",
    "these should represent the viscous and thermal time scales , which differ by @xmath53 .",
    "the combination of the finite scatter in the data points and the limited dynamic range of variation in @xmath51 on the slow part of the decay preclude one from being able to assess a possible deviation from exponentiality in the slow decay light curve as the disk drains onto the wd .",
    "this effect can be seen in the su uma superoutbursts ( e.g. , cannizzo 2001b for wz sge ) .      as a final check ,",
    "we utilize our time dependent accretion disk code to calculate a detailed light curve ( for descriptions of the code see cannizzo 1993b , 2001a ) .",
    "one recent upgrade to the code has been the provision for a variable outer disk radius , which has been implemented as described in buat - menard et al .",
    "one sees a rapid expansion of the outer disk in outburst due to the outward movement of hot , ionized gas in the heating front , followed by a slow contraction in quiescence due to the addition of low angular momentum material at the outer edge .",
    "in addition , the disk mass in outburst is generally larger , which leads to a slightly brighter outburst .",
    "we assume @xmath54 , @xmath55 cm , and @xmath56 cm . to calculate @xmath51 we assume @xmath57 pc .",
    "we perform a long run taking a mass transfer rate @xmath58 g s@xmath1 , and wait until the initial transients associated with the initial surface density profile have disappeared .",
    "we then extract a long outburst from this run .",
    "figure 3 shows the light curve , disk mass , and accretion rate onto the wd for this model .",
    "we have not performed any special tuning to enhance the duration of this long outburst , therefore its duration is somewhat shorter than the ( unusually long ) outburst of current interest ( @xmath59 d versus @xmath52 d ) .",
    "the two parallel dotted lines in the first panel indicate a decay time of 26 d mag@xmath1 .",
    "this slope matches well with that of the computed light curve .",
    "also , the variation in disk mass indicated in the second panel is in accord with the previous estimate of @xmath2 g for the accreted mass .",
    "our result supports the standard model for dwarf nova outbursts in which the outbursting disk decays primarily via simple accretion onto the wd when in the `` viscous plateau '' ( cannizzo 1993b ) stage , and @xmath60 . of all outbursts in u gem observed by the aavso over the past century ,",
    "only the oct 1985 outburst had a long enough duration to allow a fairly precise determination of its viscous plateau decay time scale .",
    "the decay time @xmath0 d mag@xmath1 is about @xmath61 times longer than observed in , for instance , the 2001 superoutburst of wz sge ( cannizzo 2001b ) , and is consistent with what one would predict based on the orbital period and outburst energetics .",
    "the more normal state of affairs for long period dne in which one frequently sees flat - topped outbursts is that the short duration ( @xmath62 d ) of the viscous plateau , combined with the slow viscous time in the outer disk , conspire to produce a much smaller dynamic variation in @xmath51 .",
    "in fact the variations that are usually seen may be due almost entirely to sloshing action of the gas in the disk as it responds to the matter redistribution accompanying the outburst , therefore one can not reliably determine a slope for the viscous plateau .",
    "dne appear to be unique in that the identification of viscous and thermal decays is reasonably firm .",
    "physical effects extrinsic to the underlying accretion disk limit cycle theory such as strong irradiation and evaporation do not alter the basic picture in a fundamental way .",
    "in contrast , the identification of viscous decays with outbursts seen in the x - ray novae - interacting binaries in which the accretor is a black hole or neutron star - is much more problematic ( ertan & alpar 1998 , king & ritter 1998 , shahbaz , charles , & king 1998 , cannizzo 2000 , wood et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we sincerely thank variable star observers worldwide who , for more than 90 y , have contributed observations on u gem to the aavso international database .",
    "it is their observations that make this study possible .",
    "frequency histogram distribution of all outburst durations in u gem , compiled from the long term aavso light curve .",
    "we utilize 1 d bins , and measure the times from @xmath50 on the rising and declining portions of the outbursts .",
    "the total number of outbursts in the distribution is 78 , with 31 below @xmath63 d , and 47 above . as with ss cyg ,",
    "the distribution is strongly bimodal , with peaks at @xmath64 d and @xmath65 d. the 39 d duration of the oct 1985 outburst is indicated by the arrow .",
    "time variation during a computed `` long '' outburst of the apparent visual magnitude ( _ top panel _ ) , the disk mass ( _ middle panel _ ) , and the rate of accretion onto the wd ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
