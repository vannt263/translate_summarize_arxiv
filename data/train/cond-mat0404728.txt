    "the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on regular lattices is one of the most important and classic combinatorial problems in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "saws are often considered in the context of lattice models of polymers .",
    "the fundamental problem is the calculation ( up to translation ) of the number of saws , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 steps . as most interesting combinatorial problems",
    ", saws have exponential growth , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the connective constant , @xmath7 is a ( known ) critical exponent @xcite , and @xmath8 is a critical amplitude .",
    "so one major problem is the calculation , or at least accurate estimation of , @xmath6 and @xmath0 in order to check the theoretical prediction .",
    "a second major problem is the calculation of critical amplitudes , such as @xmath8 , in order to test predictions for various universal amplitude combinations for two - dimensional saws @xcite .",
    "this requires , in addition to the calculation of @xmath3 , the calculation of metric properties such as the end - to - end distance and the radius of gyration .",
    "furthermore the enumeration of saws have traditionally served as a benchmark for both computer performance and algorithm design .",
    "an _ @xmath4-step self - avoiding walk _",
    "@xmath9 on a regular lattice is a sequence of _ distinct _ vertices @xmath10 such that each vertex is a nearest neighbour of it predecessor .",
    "saws are considered distinct up to translations of the starting point @xmath11 .",
    "we shall use the symbol @xmath12 to mean the set of all saws of length @xmath4 .",
    "in addition we also consider self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) .",
    "a sap can be viewed as a saw whose end - points @xmath11 and @xmath13 are nearest - neighbors and which therefore can be connected to form a closed loop by the addition of a single step .",
    "notice that there are @xmath14 saws which give rise to a given @xmath15 step sap .",
    "each vertex of the sap can be used as @xmath11 and we could walk clockwise or counter - clockwise around the perimeter of the sap .",
    "the enumeration of saws and saps has a long and glorious history , which for the square lattice has recently been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "suffice to say that early calculations were based on various direct counting algorithms of exponential complexity , with computing time @xmath16 growing asymptotically as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , the connective constant for saws .",
    "enting @xcite was the first to produce a major breakthrough by applying transfer matrix ( tm ) methods to the enumeration of saps on finite lattices .",
    "this so called finite lattice method ( flm ) led to a very significant reduction in complexity to @xmath19 , so @xmath20{3}=1.316\\ldots$ ] .",
    "more recently we @xcite refined the algorithm using the method of pruning and reduced the complexity to @xmath21 .",
    "the extension of the flm to saw enumeration had to wait until 1993 when conway , enting and guttmann @xcite implemented an algorithm with complexity @xmath19 .",
    "the algorithm is difficult to implement and requires large amounts of physical memory .",
    "however , the algorithm can not be used to calculate metric properties . in this paper",
    "we pursue a different flm algorithm based on the same ideas used to improve the sap algorithm .",
    "it appears that this pruning algorithm has a computational complexity of @xmath22 very close to the ceg algorithm .",
    "so the ceg will ultimately beat the pruning algorithm for large enough @xmath4 . for small",
    "@xmath4 the pruning algorithm actually uses significantly less memory as we shall show in section  [ sec : comp ] , and it can in addition be used to calculate metric properties . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time tm methods has been used to calculate metric properties of saws .",
    "the quantities we consider in this paper are .    *",
    "the number of saws of length @xmath4 , believed to have the asymptotic behaviour + @xmath23,\\ ] ] + where @xmath6 is the connective constant and @xmath0 is a critical exponent .",
    "we shall also study the associated generating function @xmath24,\\ ] ] + so the generating function has a singularity at @xmath25 . *",

    "the mean - square distance of a monomer from the end - points of @xmath4 step saws + @xmath33 \\right ]   = e n^{2\\nu}[1+o(1)],\\ ] ] + with the associated generating function @xmath34.\\ ] ]    the critical exponents are believed to be universal in that they only depend on the dimension of the underlying lattice .",
    "@xmath6 on the other hand is non - universal . for saws in two dimensions",
    "the critical exponents @xmath7 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been predicted exactly , though non - rigorously , using coulomb - gas arguments @xcite .    while the amplitudes are non - universal , there are many universal amplitude ratios . any ratio of the metric amplitudes , e.g. @xmath37 and @xmath38 , is expected to be universal @xcite .",
    "many other universal amplitude combinations in particular involving saps can be found in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the linear combination @xcite ( which we shall call the cscps relation ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the thermal and magnetic renormalization - group eigenvalues , respectively , of the @xmath4-vector model at @xmath42 . in two dimensions ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , hence @xmath45 ) cardy and saleur @xcite ( as corrected by caracciolo , pelissetto and sokal @xcite ) have predicted , using conformal field theory , that @xmath46 . this conclusion has been confirmed by previous high - precision monte carlo work @xcite as well as by series extrapolations @xcite .",
    "privman and redner @xcite proved that the combination @xmath47 is universal .",
    "@xmath48 is an integer constant such that @xmath49 is non - zero when @xmath4 is divisible by @xmath48 .",
    "so @xmath50 for the triangular lattice and 2 for the square and honeycomb lattices .",
    "@xmath51 is the area per lattice site and @xmath52 for the square lattice , @xmath53 for the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath54 for the triangular lattice .",
    "the asymptotic form ( [ eq : sawasymp ] ) for @xmath3 only explicitly gives the leading contribution .",
    "in general one would expect corrections to scaling so @xmath55\\ ] ] in addition to `` analytic '' corrections to scaling of the form @xmath56 , there are `` non - analytic '' corrections to scaling of the form @xmath57 , where the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath58 is nt an integer .",
    "in fact one would expect a whole sequence of correction - to - scaling exponents @xmath59 , which are both universal and also independent of the observable , that is , the same for @xmath3 , @xmath49 , and so on .",
    "much effort has been devoted to determining the leading non - analytic correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath58 for two - dimensional saws and saps .",
    "at least two different theoretical predictions have been made for the exact value of this exponent : @xmath60 based on coulomb - gas arguments @xcite , and @xmath61 based on conformal - invariance methods @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite we studied the amplitudes and the correction - to - scaling exponents for two - dimensional saws , using a combination of series - extrapolation and monte carlo methods .",
    "we enumerated all self - avoiding walks up to 59 steps on the square lattice , and up to 40 steps on the triangular lattice , measuring the metric properties mentioned above , and then carried out a detailed and careful analysis of the data in order to accurately estimate the amplitudes and correction - to - scaling exponent . in this paper",
    "we give a detailed account of the algorithm used to calculate the square lattice series analysed in @xcite , report on a further extension of the saw counts up to 71 steps , analyse the series and confirm to great accuracy the predicted exact values of the critical exponents , and finally we briefly summarise the results of the analysis from @xcite .",
    "the algorithm we use to enumerate saws on the square lattice builds on the pioneering work of enting @xcite who enumerated square lattice self - avoiding polygons using the finite lattice method .",
    "more specifically our algorithm is based in large part on the one devised by conway , enting and guttmann @xcite for the enumeration of saws .",
    "the basic idea of the finite lattice method is to calculate partial generating functions for various properties of a given model on finite pieces , say @xmath62 rectangles of the square lattice , and then reconstruct a series expansion for the infinite lattice limit by combining the results from the finite pieces .",
    "the generating function for any finite piece is calculated using transfer matrix ( tm ) techniques .",
    "the most efficient implementation of the tm algorithm generally involves bisecting the finite lattice with a boundary ( this is just a line in the case of rectangles ) and moving the boundary in such a way as to build up the lattice cell by cell .",
    "the sum over all contributing graphs is calculated as the boundary is moved through the lattice . due to the symmetry of the square lattice",
    "we need only consider rectangles with @xmath63 .",
    "saws in a given rectangle are enumerated by moving the intersection so as to add one vertex at a time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] . for each configuration of occupied or empty edges along the intersection",
    "we maintain a generating function for partial walks cutting the intersection in that particular pattern .",
    "if we draw a saw and then cut it by a line we observe that the partial saw to the left of this line consists of a number of loops connecting two edges ( we shall refer to these as loop ends ) in the intersection , and pieces which are connected to only one edge ( we call these free ends ) .",
    "the other end of the free piece is an end point of the saw so there are at most two free ends . in applying the transfer matrix technique to the enumeration of saws",
    "we regard them as sets of edges on the finite lattice with the properties :    * a weight @xmath64 is associated with an occupied edge . in some cases",
    "one gives different weights @xmath64 and @xmath65 to occupied horizontal and vertical edges , respectively .",
    "* all vertices are of degree 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "* there are at most two vertices of degree 1 and the final graph has exactly two vertices of degree 1 ( the end points of the saw ) . *",
    "apart from isolated sites , the final graph has a single connected component .",
    "* in some implementations each graph must span the rectangle from left to right , while in other implementations each graph must span the rectangle from left to right and from bottom to top .     a snapshot of the boundary line ( dashed line ) during the transfer matrix calculation on the square lattice .",
    "saws are enumerated by successive moves of the kink in the boundary line , as exemplified by the position given by the dotted line , so that one vertex at a time is added to the rectangle . to the left of the boundary line",
    "we have drawn an example of a partially completed saw . ]",
    "we are not allowed to form closed loops , so two loop ends can only be joined if they belong to different loops . to exclude loops which close on themselves we need to label the occupied edges in such a way that we can easily determine whether or not two loop ends belong to the same loop .",
    "the most obvious choice would be to give each loop a unique label .",
    "however , on two - dimensional lattices there is a more compact scheme relying on the fact that two loops can never intertwine .",
    "each end of a loop is assigned one of two labels depending on whether it is the lower end or the upper end of a loop .",
    "each configuration along the boundary line can thus be represented by a set of edge states @xmath66 , where    @xmath67    if we read from the bottom to the top , the configuration along the intersection of the partial saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] is @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to see that this encoding uniquely describes which loop ends are connected . in order to find the upper loop end , matching a given lower end , we start at the lower end and work up wards in the configuration counting the number of  1 s and  2 s we pass ( the ` 1 ' of the initial lower end is _ not _ included in the count ) .",
    "we stop when the number of  2 s exceeds the number of  1 s .",
    "this ` 2 ' marks the matching upper end of the loop .",
    "it is worth noting that there are some restrictions on the possible configurations .",
    "firstly , every lower loop end must have a corresponding upper end , and it is therefore clear that the total number of  1 s is equal to the total number of  2 s .",
    "secondly , as we look through the configuration starting from the bottom the number of  1 s is never smaller than the number of  2 s . ignoring the ` 0 s the ' 1 s and  2 s can be viewed as perfectly balanced parenthesis .",
    "those familiar with algebraic languages will immediately recognize that each configuration ( for now treating free ends and empty edges in the same way ) of labeled loop ends forms a motzkin word @xcite .",
    "the updating of a partial generating function depends on the states of the edges to the left and above the new vertex .",
    "when the kink is moved we insert the edges to the right and below the new vertex .",
    "the way to avoid situations leading to graphs with more than a single connected component is to forbid free ends from terminating ( or joining ) at the vertex being processed unless the boundary line intersects no other occupied edges . in table  [ tab : update ] we have listed the possible local ` input ' states and the ` output ' states which arise as the kink in the boundary is propagated by one step .",
    "the rows in this table are labeled by the state of the left edge while the columns are labeled by the state of the top edge .",
    "each panel in the table contains the possible states of the bottom and right edges ( in that order ) .",
    "we shall refer to the configuration before the move as the ` source ' and a configuration produced as a result of the move as a ` target ' . in each move",
    "the source generating function is multiplied by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of new occupied edges ( just the number of non - zero entries in the local output state ) , and is then added to the target generating function .    in the following",
    "we give the details of how some of these updating rules are derived .",
    ".[tab : update ] the various local ` input ' states and the ` output ' states which arise as the boundary line is moved in order to include one more vertex of the lattice .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 were also estimated by direct extrapolation of the relevant quotient sequence , using the following method @xcite : given a sequence @xmath71 defined for @xmath72 , assumed to converge to a limit @xmath73 with corrections of the form @xmath74 , we first construct a new sequence @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 . the generating function @xmath77 .",
    "estimates for @xmath73 and the parameter @xmath78 can then be obtained from differential approximants . in this way",
    ", we obtained the estimates @xcite , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the square lattice and @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the triangular lattice .",

    "finally we turn to the estimation of the amplitude @xmath8 using the new extended 71 term series . as in previous work @xcite",
    "we find it very useful to plot the amplitude estimates vs. @xmath85 where @xmath3 is the last coefficient used by the fit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl ] we plot the estimates for the leading amplitude @xmath8 from various fits .",

    "is increased we see that the estimates settle down and that fits using more terms display less curvature .",
    "we take this as a clear indication that the fitting procedure is robust and that the assumed asymptotic expansion is correct .",
    "the fits using 5 , 6 , and 7 terms each can clearly be extrapolated to a value @xmath88 . in the right panel",
    "we plot amplitude estimates from @xmath86-fits with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , 5 and 4 .",
    "we do this merely to point out that clearly only @xmath86-fits with @xmath91 close to @xmath70 are reliable .",
