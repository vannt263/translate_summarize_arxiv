    "convincing evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are able to form in the early universe is provided by observations of high - redshift quasars ( e.g. , volonteri & rees 2006 ; vestergaard & osmer 2009 ; willott et al .",
    "2010 ; treister et al .",
    "the seeds for these early smbhs may have been produced from supermassive ( e.g. , begelman 2010 ) or population iii stars , or from direct gas collapse ( e.g. , volonteri & natarajan 2009 ) , perhaps in massive protogalaxy mergers ( e.g. , mayer et al .",
    "2010 ; volonteri 2010 ) . while high - redshift quasars generally display optical / uv and x - ray properties similar to those of their local analogues ( e.g. , shemmer et al .  2006 ) , _ spitzer _ observations indicate many are young sources ( some lack hot dust ) that are growing rapidly ( jiang et al .",
    "in contrast , similarly massive smbhs at more moderate redshifts are growing more slowly ( e.g. , netzer et al .  2007 ) .",
    "indeed , the growth of smbhs appears to be `` anti - hierarchical '' in the sense that active accretion is concentrated in higher / lower - mass smbhs at earlier / later cosmological times ( e.g. , heckman et al .  2004 ; merloni & heinz 2007 ; shankar et al .",

    "2005 ) . the distinctions between active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , low - luminosity agns ( ho 1999 , 2008 ) , and formally inactive galaxies are somewhat arbitrary , but as a general guideline ( which we will adhere to in this work ) agns display bolometric , eddington - scaled luminosities in excess of a few percent , low - luminosity agns are in the range @xmath12 , and inactive nuclei are highly sub - eddington , with @xmath13.5ex@xmath6 .",

    "even low levels of smbh accretion - powered activity in nearby galaxies may be detected efficiently in sensitive , high spatial resolution observations , although contamination from bright binaries must be properly accounted for when dealing with nuclear x - ray luminosities comparable to the eddington limit for a few solar masses ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; gallo et al .",
    "this problem can be substantially alleviated by restricting the search for highly sub - eddington nuclei to early - type galaxies , as they conveniently avoid the brighter high - mass binaries produced concurrently with star formation ( e.g. , king et al .",

    "the growth of smbhs is believed to be closely tied to the evolution of their hosts ( as evidenced by , for example , the correlations between smbh mass and bulge luminosity or central stellar velocity dispersion ; see , e.g. , overview by ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",

    "naturally the properties of higher - mass smbhs ( in more massive galaxies ) may be more easily constrained ; the dominance of compact stellar nuclei at lower luminosities ( e.g. , ferrarese et al .",

    "the presence of `` missing light '' or cores within luminous ellipticals may be explained by binary black holes disrupting the interior region in the process of merging ( e.g. , kormendy et al .",
