    "motion in three - dimensional systems can differ in a number of qualitative ways from motion in one or two dimensions .",
    "one example is complex instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which perturbations of a periodic orbit diverge exponentially while rotating with a characteristic frequency .",
    "another example is arnold diffusion ( @xcite ) , the non - isolation of chaotic regions in phase space .",
    "the focus of the present study is on a different property of three - dimensional motion .",
    "associated with each degree of freedom of regular ( quasi - periodic ) motion is a frequency @xmath2 , the rate of change of the corresponding angle variable .",
    "the character of the motion depends critically on whether the @xmath2 s are independent , or whether they satisfy one or more nontrivial linear relations of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) and @xmath5 integers , not all of which are zero .",
    "generally there exists no relation like equation ( [ res ] ) ; the frequencies are incommensurable , and the trajectory fills its torus uniformly and densely in a time - averaged sense .",
    "when one or more resonance relations are satisfied , however , the trajectory is restricted to a phase space region of lower dimensionality than @xmath4 .",
    "the importance of resonances for motion in two - dimensional systems is well known : resonant tori  periodic , or closed , orbits ",
    "are regions where the independent motions are coupled together , leading to a breakdown in perturbation expansions .",
    "the character of the motion near a resonance is described by a number of theorems , including the poincar - birkhoff and floquet theorems .",
    "when stable , resonant tori generate new families of regular orbits whose shape mimics that of the parent periodic orbit .",
    "unstable resonant tori are typically associated with a breakdown of integrability and with chaos . in this sense ,",
    "periodic orbits provide the phase space of a 2 dof system with its structure .    in three dimensions ,",
    "a single resonance relation like equation ( [ res ] ) does not imply that an orbit will be closed ; rather , it restricts the orbit to a space of dimension two .",
    "an orbit satisying one such relation is therefore `` thin , '' confined for all time to a ( possibly self - intersecting ) membrane . in order for an orbit in a 3 dof system to be closed",
    ", it must satisfy two such independent relations ; only then is the motion confined to a one - dimensional curve .",
    "one expects that orbits satisfying two resonance relations will be rare compared to orbits satisfying just one , and hence that thin orbits  rather than periodic orbits ",
    "are the objects of fundamental importance in structuring the phase space of 3 dof systems .",
    "we present evidence in support of this hypothesis below .",
    "the emphasis in the present paper is on three - dimensional resonances , i.e. , resonances for which each of the integers @xmath5 in equation ( 1 ) is nonzero .",
    "thin orbits generated from a two - dimensional resonance have been widely studied ; examples are the `` thin tubes '' discussed by bishop , de zeeuw and collaborators ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thin tube orbits exist even in fully integrable potentials ; they are linked to the @xmath6 resonant orbits in the principal planes of stckel models ( @xcite ) . by contrast , most of the resonant orbits discussed here can not be associated with any planar orbit ; their existence is a consequence of a coupling between all three degrees of freedom and they have no analog in two - dimensional or in stckel potentials .",
    "the importance of resonant orbits in 3 dof systems was suggested by a number of recent studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that applied torus - construction machinery to motion in triaxial potentials .",
    "these studies noted that the phase space of box orbits , i.e. orbits with a stationary point , is densely structured by resonances , especially in models with central mass concentrations or nuclear `` black holes . ''",
    "valluri & merritt ( 1998 ) noted that a resonance relation like equation ( 1 ) implies a reduction in the dimensionality of an orbit and presented an illustration of a thin box orbit .",
    "here we study the properties of such orbits in more detail .",
    "section 2 discusses the reduction in dimensionality that follows from the existence of a resonance between the three degrees of freedom .",
    "section 3 presents the properties of thin box orbits in a family of triaxial models with central density cusps and nuclear black holes ; the emphasis is on the conditions under which such orbits are stable and can give rise to families of quasi - periodic orbits with finite thickness .",
    "section 4 extends this discussion to the central regions of a triaxial galaxy containing a black hole , where the potential is nearly keplerian .",
    "some implications for galactic structure and evolution are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this section we discuss the effect of a resonance relation like equation ( [ res ] ) on the motion of a regular orbit , and the differences between resonances in 2 and 3 dof systems .",
    "for a two - dimensional regular orbit with fundamental frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the angle variables are @xmath9 which define the surface of a torus .",
    "the constants indicating phase on the torus have been set to zero without loss of generality .",
    "because of the quasi - periodicity of the orbit , its torus can be mapped onto a square in the @xmath10-plane , with each side ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( figure 1 ) ; the top and bottom of the square are identified with each other , as are the left and right sides . in the general case ,",
    "the frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 are incommensurate and the trajectory densely covers the entire @xmath10-plane after an infinite time . however if the ratio @xmath13 is a rational number , i.e. if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integers , the orbit closes on itself after @xmath16 revolutions in @xmath17 and @xmath18 revolutions in @xmath19 and fills only a one - dimensional subset of its torus ( e.g. @xcite , p. 164 ) .",
    "its dimensionality in configuration space is also one .",
    "such an orbit has a single fundamental frequency @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the orbital period ; after an elapsed time @xmath21 , the trajectory returns to its starting point in phase space .",
    "the effect of resonances on the motion in two - dimensional , non - integrable potentials is well understood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "resonant orbits , when stable to perturbations , are associated with families of regular orbits , and when unstable generate regions of stochasticity .",
    "examples of resonant orbit families in two - dimensional galactic potentials are the boxlets ( @xcite ) which exist in the principal planes of triaxial models .",
    "two - dimensional resonances in the meridional plane of axisymmetric systems ( @xcite ) and in planar barred potentials ( @xcite ) have also been treated in detail .    in the case of a three - dimensional regular orbit",
    ", the angle variables are @xmath22 the orbit may now be mapped into a cube whose axes are identified with the @xmath23 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "if the @xmath2 are incommensurate , this cube will be densely filled after a long time .",
    "however if a single condition of the form @xmath24 is satisfied , with the @xmath5 integers ( not all of which are zero ) , the motion is restricted for all time to a two - dimensional subset of its torus ( @xcite , p. 91 ; @xcite , p. 470 ) .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure 2 , with @xmath25 .",
    "such an orbit is not closed ; instead , as suggested by figure 2 , it is _ thin _ , restricted to a sheet or membrane in configuration space , which it fills densely after infinite time .",
    "just as in the two - dimensional case , the condition ( [ commen ] ) may be used to reduce the number of independent frequencies by one . defining the two `` base '' frequencies @xmath26",
    "as @xmath27 we may write @xmath28 since the motion is quasi - periodic , i.e. @xmath29 with @xmath30 integers , it will remain quasi - periodic when expressed in terms of the two base frequencies : @xmath31 t \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_k { \\bf x}_k\\exp i \\left({l_k}'\\omega_0^{(1 ) } + { m_k}'\\omega_0^{(2)}\\right)t , \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\sum_k { \\bf x}_k\\exp i \\left({l_k}'\\theta^{(1 ) } + { m_k}'\\theta^{(2)}\\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\   { l_k } ' & = & -l_k m_3 + n_k m_1 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ { m_k } ' = -l_k m_2 + m_k   m_1 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\theta^{(1 ) } & = & \\omega_0^{(1)}t , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "\\theta^{(2 ) } = \\omega_0^{(2)}t .    \\label{qp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a fourier transform of the motion will therefore consist of a set of spikes whose positions in frequency space can be expressed as linear combinations of just two frequencies .",
    "the choice of base frequencies made here is clearly not unique , a consequence of the fact that the orbit is not closed .",
    "a relation like equation ( [ commen ] ) will be called a `` resonance '' even though it does not imply that any frequency pair can be expressed as a ratio of integers .",
    "the integer vector @xmath32 is the order of the resonance ; the degeneracy of the resonance is defined as the number of independent resonance relations that are satisfied by the @xmath2 . in the case of twofold degeneracy , two independent resonance relations apply : @xmath33 and each frequency @xmath2 may be expressed as a rational fraction of any other : @xmath34 with @xmath35 integers .",
    "the motion is therefore periodic with a single base frequency @xmath36 and the trajectory is closed . in a system with @xmath4 degrees of freedom , @xmath37",
    "such conditions are required for closure ; only in the 2dof case does a single resonance condition imply closure .",
    "relations like equation ( [ commen ] ) . ]",
    "the reduction of the dimensionality of an orbit in the presence of a resonance has been appreciated at least since einstein s 1917 paper on rules for classical quantization ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . but",
    "the role of resonant orbits in structuring the phase space of generic , three - dimensional systems is still not well understood .",
    "almost all discussions of resonances in the galactic dynamics literature have focussed on restricted cases : on resonances between only two of the three degrees of freedom ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; on doubly - degenerate , i.e. closed , orbits ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; or on special potentials in which the motion is globally resonant , such as the kepler potential .",
    "the kam theorem leads us to expect that  in 3 dof as in 2 dof systems  resonant tori are regions where perturbation expansions break down , leading to a change in the local structure of phase space .",
    "we expect thin orbits to play approximately the same role , in three dimensions , that periodic orbits play in two .",
    "we test this hypothesis by exploring the properties of thin orbits in one family of triaxial potentials .",
    "the mass density law from which the potential was generated , via poisson s equation , has the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 the total mass and @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] the radius - like variable .",
    "this mass model is the generalization to triaxial geometry of the spherical family described by dehnen ( 1993 ) .",
    "the potential and forces in the triaxial geometry may be expressed in terms of one - dimensional integrals ( @xcite ) .",
    "dehnen s law has a power - law central density dependence which approximates the observed luminosity profiles of early - type galaxies and bulges ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to this model",
    "was added a central point with mass @xmath41 . here and below ,",
    "units are adopted such that @xmath42 ; @xmath41 is therefore defined as the mass of the central object in units of the total galaxy mass . following the usual convention ,",
    "the @xmath43- and @xmath44-axes are identified with the long and short axes of the figure .",
    "the character of the motion in triaxial dehnen models , at radii well outside the gravitational radius of influence of the black hole ( if present ) , has been discussed by wachlin & ferraz - mello ( 1998 ) and valluri & merritt ( 1998 ) . as in those studies ,",
    "orbits were integrated from various starting positions with zero initial velocity for @xmath45 orbital periods and their motion analyzed using laskar s ( 1988 , 1990 ) algorithm , a fourier technique for extracting the fundamental frequencies @xmath2 of a regular orbit with high precision .",
    "the additional techniques described in valluri & merritt ( 1998 ) were used to find the integers @xmath30 associated with each distinct peak @xmath46 in the frequency spectrum ( equation [ qp1 ] ) . for stochastic orbits ,",
    "laskar s technique gives an approximation , valid over the integration interval , of the true ( continuous ) spectrum .",
    "stochastic orbits were identified by integrating each trajectory for two contiguous time intervals and comparing the `` fundamental frequencies '' computed over each interval .",
    "the change in the `` fundamental frequency '' associated with the largest amplitude term in the spectrum , @xmath47 , was taken as a measure of the rate of stochastic diffusion in phase space ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 3 shows initial condition spaces for two triaxial dehnen models , the first with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the second with @xmath48 and @xmath50 . both models have @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the top frames ( reproduced with slight modification from @xcite ) show one octant of the equipotential surface , each located slightly within the half - mass radius of the model ( or at `` shell 8 '' in the notation of those authors ) . on this surface ,",
    "a grid of @xmath53 orbits were begun with zero velocity and integrated for 100 orbital periods .",
    "the density of the gray scale is proportional to the logarithm of the stochastic diffusion rate as measured by @xmath47 over the integration interval .",
    "initial conditions for which the motion was found to be regular are shown in white .",
    "the model of figure 3a is close to integrable , with a finite central force and a moderate central force gradient .",
    "most of the significant stochasticity in this model is confined to initial conditions that lie between the short and intermediate axes , the `` @xmath54-@xmath55 instability strip '' first described by goodman & schwarzschild ( 1981 ) .    elsewhere on the equipotential surface",
    ", one sees a complex network of intersecting resonance zones , some regular ( white ) and some stochastic ( dark ) .",
    "the starting points of the thin orbits lie along the centers of these zones .",
    "several of the most important resonance zones in figure 3a are labelled by their defining integers .",
    "three of these  the @xmath56 ( @xmath43-@xmath44 banana ) resonance , the @xmath57 ( @xmath43-@xmath58 pretzel ) resonance , and the @xmath59 ( @xmath43-@xmath44 fish ) resonance  are families that connect smoothly to periodic orbits in one of the principal planes , i.e. to `` boxlets '' ( @xcite ) . others ",
    "e.g. the @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 resonances  are not related to any planar periodic orbit ; these resonances are characterized by nonzero values for each of the integers @xmath5 .",
    "examples of thin orbits from each of these six families are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "figure 4 plots intersections of the orbits with the three principal planes ; because these orbits are thin , their intersection with any plane defines a curve or set of curves , rather than a finite area as in the case of a volume - filling orbit .",
    "none of the orbits passes precisely through the center although all of them come quite close .",
    "figure 5 presents views of the surfaces defined by the orbits .",
    "these plots were generated using laskar s algorithm to extract the frequency spectra , equation ( [ qp1 ] ) , followed by equation ( [ qp2 ] ) which yields the cartesian coordinates in terms of the two reduced angle variables @xmath63 . the resulting ( numerical ) functions @xmath64 define a surface that was plotted via the _ mathematica _ routine `` parametricplot3d . ''    when projected against the principal planes , the thinness of these orbits is not readily apparent and it is likely that thin box orbits were seen but not identified as such in many earlier studies .",
    "a possible example is shown in figure 6 of levison & richstone ( 1987 ) .    while there are initial conditions in figure 3a that generate closed orbits ",
    "orbits restricted to a single curve in configuration space  the majority of regular orbits are identifiable only with a singly - degenerate resonance zone . further evidence for this interpretation is provided by figure 6 , which shows the frequency spectra of two orbits , computed by fourier analysis of the @xmath44-component of the motion .",
    "the first orbit is from the regular region that lies at the intersection of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 resonance zones in figure 3a .",
    "the intersection of these zones defines a regular region of degeneracy two , associated with the closed , @xmath65 orbit at its center .",
    "the second orbit is from the @xmath61 resonance zone ; this orbit is not obviously identified with any closed orbit .",
    "many of the lines in the spectrum of the first orbit , figure 6a , lie precisely at integer multiples of a single base frequency , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "this frequency is close to the ( single ) frequency of the @xmath65 periodic orbit whose starting point lies nearby on the equipotential surface .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of figure 6a contains pairs of lines that are offset symmetrically from the primary lines , at frequencies of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these two additional frequencies may be interpreted as resulting from the slow libration , in two independent directions , of the orbit around the parent closed orbit .",
    "( binney & spergel ( 1982 ) motivate this interpretation in the context of a two - dimensional orbit . )",
    "the spectrum of the orbit in figure 6a is thus clearly recognizable as that of a perturbed , closed orbit .",
    "by contrast , the spectrum of the second orbit ( figure 6b ) contains lines at integer multiples of _ two _ base frequencies .",
    "these may be defined as @xmath72 , the frequency associated with the strongest line in the @xmath43-spectrum , and @xmath73 , the primary frequency of the @xmath44-motion .",
    "the strongest line in the @xmath58-spectrum lies at @xmath74 , consistent with the location of this orbit within the @xmath61 resonance zone . if the orbit whose spectrum is shown in figure 6b were precisely thin , all of its lines would be representable in terms of the two base frequencies , as discussed above .",
    "however one observes a third frequency in the form of multiplets at frequencies @xmath75 , with @xmath76 .",
    "the `` splitting '' frequency @xmath77 is the same ( within numerical precision ) for all of the multiplets of figure 6b and in all three @xmath78 of the spectra .",
    "thus , this orbit is clearly identifiable as a perturbed thin orbit rather than as a perturbed closed orbit .",
    "both spectra show additional , higher - order multiplets at low amplitude .",
    "examination of the spectra of a larger set of orbits suggests that regular orbits whose starting points lie within a ( singly - degenerate ) resonant zone always have spectra like that of figure 6b , i.e. with two base frequencies and a single splitting frequency , rather than like that of figure 6a , with a single base frequency and two splitting frequencies . in this sense",
    "it is reasonable to state that the majority of regular orbits at this energy are associated with thin orbits and not with closed orbits .",
    "a striking feature of figure 3a is the large number of distinct , and fairly narrow , resonance zones .",
    "the reason for the narrowness of the zones is suggested by figure 3c , which shows the distance of closest approach to the potential center of a set of orbits whose initial conditions lie along the heavy curve in figure 3a . as one passes through a stable resonance zone , the orbital pericenter distance reaches a maximum on the resonance , where the orbit has zero thickness .",
    "initial conditions that lie to either side of the resonance produce orbits with a finite thickness ; as this thickness increases , the pericenter distance falls , and eventually the orbit becomes thick enough to pass through the center of the potential .",
    "orbits with pericenter distances close to zero are generally stochastic , as shown in figure 3e  a likely consequence of the steepness of the force gradient near the center , which causes the trajectory to become sensitive to small perturbations .",
    "the precise distance from the center at which stochasticity sets in is different for each resonant family but is typically of order @xmath79 at this energy in this potential .",
    "( the linear scale of the orbits is of order @xmath80 at this energy ) .",
    "the narrowness of the resonance zones is therefore a consequence of the fact that only a slight offset of an orbit s starting point from resonance is sufficient to force it into the destabilizing center .",
    "the space between the primary resonance zones in figure 3a appears to be criss - crossed by a large number of narrower zones .",
    "some of these additional zones are identified in figure 3c with their integer vectors @xmath32",
    ". a further illustration of the dense packing of resonance zones is given in figure 7 , which shows the transition between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 resonant orbits along the heavy line of initial conditions shown in figure 3a .",
    "as one moves between these two primary zones , one passes over the two subsidiary zones  with orders @xmath81 and @xmath82  which can also be clearly seen in the pericenter plot , figure 3c .",
    "but resonances of even higher order are apparent in figure 7",
    ". the only orbits in that figure that appear to be genuinely volume - filling  numbers 11 and 16  are slightly stochastic , although weakly enough that their stochasticity does not allow them to visit the full volume defined by the equipotential surface over an integration interval of @xmath45 oscillations .",
    "( the weak stochasticity is a consequence of the low degree of central concentration of this model , @xmath48 , and the absence of a central `` black hole . '' ) thus , essentially every regular orbit in this set appears to be associated with a resonance .",
    "the denseness of the resonance zones is not surprising . in an integrable potential ,",
    "where the fundamental frequencies vary smoothly with initial conditions , it is well known that resonant tori are dense in the phase space , just as rational numbers are dense in the space of real numbers .",
    "even a slight perturbation of the potential away from exact integrability would be expected to radically change the motion in the neighborhood of each of these resonances , in the same way that the motion in perturbed 2d systems is strongly affected by the existence and stability of closed orbits .",
    "some of the resonance zones in figure 3a are present also in figure 3b , which shows an equipotential surface in the model with an added central point mass , @xmath50 .",
    "however the higher - order resonance zones ( e.g. @xmath83 , @xmath81 ) have disappeared ; the motion in the corresponding regions is now chaotic .",
    "a second difference is that  within a given resonance zone  chaos sets in well before an orbit is thick enough to sample the center ( figure 3d , f ) .",
    "evidently , an added central mass point can induce stochasticity even in orbits that do not pass particularly close to the center .",
    "figure 8 shows the approximate pericenter distance at which integrability is destroyed for three of the resonant orbit families in figure 3b , as a function of the central mass @xmath41 ; in each of these potentials , the amplitude of the long - axis orbit is about 2 .",
    "when @xmath41 exceeds @xmath84 the mass of the galaxy  typical of the black holes in a number of early - type galaxies ( @xcite )  a pericenter distance of @xmath85 of the orbital amplitude is sufficient to induce stochasticity for each of these families .",
    "the highest - order resonant family in figure 8 , the @xmath62 family , has been rendered completely chaotic for @xmath86 , and the other families disappear for @xmath87 .    valluri & merritt ( 1998 ) reported a transition to global stochasticity in the phase space of box orbits when the mass of a central point exceeded @xmath88 the galaxy mass .",
    "figure 8 suggests a simple explanation for this transition : when the central mass is sufficiently great , even resonant orbits are unable to avoid the center by a wide enough margin to remain stable .",
    "it was argued above that the majority of regular orbits in these potentials are properly associated with thin orbits rather than with closed orbits .",
    "further evidence in support of this claim is presented in figure 9 , which shows the variation of the splitting frequency @xmath77 defined above with initial conditions as one moves across the @xmath61 resonance zone in the potential with @xmath48 and @xmath89 .",
    "the variation in @xmath77 is generally smooth , peaking on the resonance and falling off to either side .",
    "this smooth variation suggests a continuous dependence of orbital properties on initial coordinates near the resonance .",
    "one also sees some discontinuities ; inspection of the individual orbits reveals the existence of additional resonances , i.e. closed orbits , at these points .",
    "these closed orbits must in some sense be dense in phase space .",
    "however the generally smooth variation of @xmath77 with initial conditions suggests that the majority of orbits in a singly - degenerate resonance zone can be usefully associated with the resonance .",
    "the character of the orbits , as well as the relative importance of thin orbits , might be expected to change as one approaches the center of a triaxial potential containing a nuclear black hole .",
    "pfenniger & de zeeuw ( 1989 ) and sridhar & touma ( 1998 ) noted that the motion in the neighborhood of the black hole , i.e. at radii such that the mass of the black hole is comparable to or greater than the enclosed mass in stars , should be approximately integrable , and these authors presented the results of numerical integrations in two - dimensional harmonic - oscillator potentials with added central point masses .",
    "we begin by describing how the population of box orbits changes as one moves from the half - mass radius into the region where the forces are dominated by the black hole .",
    "we chose a dehnen model with @xmath48 and @xmath50 ; the latter value is typical of the black hole mass ratio in early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) , and the weak cusp specified by @xmath48 is characteristic of bright elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) , in which the evolution timescales due to chaotic mixing are long enough that a triaxial shape might maintain itself for roughly a hubble time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . following merritt & fridman ( 1996 ) , the mass model without the black hole",
    "was divided into 21 ellipsoidal shells of equal mass ; thus the outer edge of shell 1 contains 1/21 of the total mass and shell 21 lies at infinity .",
    "the energy corresponding to each shell was defined as the value of the gravitational potential  now including the contribution from the central black hole  on the @xmath43-axis at the outer edge of the shell .",
    "the ratio of @xmath41 to the stellar mass enclosed by shell i , @xmath90 , is then @xmath91 .    at shell 8 ( @xmath92 )",
    ", the diffusion rate map is given by figure 3b .",
    "as the energy is reduced , the fraction of the starting points on the equipotential surface that generate regular motion drops ; by shell 2 ( @xmath93 ) , the motion is almost entirely chaotic , containing only small regular regions associated with the @xmath56 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 resonances . at shell 1 ( @xmath94",
    "the motion of box orbits is essentially fully stochastic .",
    "this transition to global stochasticity in the phase space of box orbits as the energy is reduced is similar to the change observed by valluri & merritt ( 1998 ) , at a _ fixed _ energy ( shell 8) , as @xmath41 was increased .",
    "those authors found that the motion of box orbits became almost completely stochastic when the mass of the black hole increased past @xmath95 times the total mass of the model , or equivalently , @xmath96 times the enclosed mass .",
    "we speculate that a transition to global stochasticity in the phase space of box orbits generically occurs at radii where the black hole contains of order @xmath88 of the enclosed mass in triaxial potentials .    inside of this radius , a zone of chaos",
    "was found to extend inwards , roughly to the radius at which the gravitational force from the black hole begins to dominate the force from the stars . to explore this central region",
    ", we defined a new set of shells , denoted by the index @xmath97 , which divide the previously - innermost shell ( @xmath98 ) again into 21 equal - mass shells ; thus shell @xmath99 encloses @xmath100 of the total stellar mass , etc .",
    "the ratio of the black hole mass to the enclosed stellar mass within this region is therefore @xmath101 .",
    "figure 10 illustrates the behavior of the box orbits as one moves from the inner edge of the zone of chaos , at shell @xmath102 ( @xmath103 , into shell @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "in addition to plots of the diffusion rate , as in figure 3 , we show the `` frequency maps '' defined by papaphilippou & laskar ( 1998 ) .",
    "the first regular orbits to appear inside of the zone of chaos are associated with the ( @xmath106 resonance , the @xmath107 banana orbit . unlike the banana orbit at higher energies , which lie close to the long ( @xmath43 ) axis , this banana orbit has its stationary point near the short ( @xmath44 ) axis of the model .",
    "as one moves inward , a regular region appears around the short axis , and grows to include most of the equipotential surface , with the exception of a strip connecting the @xmath43 and @xmath58 axes .",
    "a number of stable and unstable resonances can be seen at each shell but most of these are important only over a very narrow range of energies ; the only stable resonance that persists over a signficant radial range is the ( @xmath108 ) resonance .",
    "the rapid variation in the resonance zones as the energy is reduced corresponds to a shift in the fundamental frequencies toward @xmath109 , the expected behavior as one approaches the keplerian potential of the black hole .",
    "we note that passage through the `` zone of chaos '' has the effect of reversing the dynamical roles of the long and short axes . at large energies , motion is stable ( unstable ) in the vicinity of the long ( short ) axes , respectively , and an instability strip extends from the short to the intermediate axes ( goodman & schwarzschild 1981 ; figure 3 ) . inside the zone of chaos , motion near",
    "the _ short _ axis becomes stable , and the instability strip extends from the intermediate to the long axes ( figure 10 ) . as noted above , the @xmath107 banana orbit also changes its direction of elongation , from the long to the short axis .",
    "sridhar & touma ( 1998 ) noted , in their study of two - dimensional motion in the vicinity of a black hole , that the regular orbits are often elongated in the direction of the shorter of the two axes ; our results suggest that the same is true with regard to the minor axis of a triaxial galaxy , at least in the case of the particular family of potentials investigated here .",
    "the two most important families of boxlike orbits near the black hole are illustrated in figure 11 .",
    "the first family ( figure 11a ) consists of regular orbits not associated with any low - order resonance ; similar orbits in two dimensions were called `` lenses '' by sridhar & touma ( 1998 ) .",
    "those authors noted that 2d lens orbits could be approximately described as precessing keplerian ellipses with one focus on the black hole .",
    "the orbits found here appear to be straightforward generalizations , to three dimensions , of sridhar & touma s lenses , precessing independently in the @xmath110 and @xmath107 planes .",
    "these orbits are essentially volume - filling although close inspection of their cross - sections reveals that many are associated with a high - order resonance .",
    "the second major family consists of orbits associated with the ( @xmath108 ) thin box mentioned above .",
    "the resonant orbits that give rise to this family ( figure 11b ) are elongated parallel to the @xmath111 plane ; the symmetric objects formed by superposition of four such orbits , reflected about the principal planes , might be useful for self - consistently reconstructing a triaxial figure .",
    "the ( symmetrized ) lens orbits are elongated parallel to the short axis of the triaxial figure and would probably not be very useful for this purpose , as noted by sridhar & touma ( 1998 ) .",
    "our principal conclusions follow .    \\1 .",
    "resonant orbits  orbits confined for all time to a membrane in configuration space  play roughly the same role , in three dimensions , that periodic orbits play in two , generating families of regular orbits when stable and stochastic orbits when unstable .",
    "box orbits in realistic triaxial potentials are generically thin .",
    "their thickness is limited by the requirement that they avoid the destabilizing center of the potential ; orbits that pass too near the center become stochastic . in triaxial mass models with central `` black holes ''",
    "containing @xmath112 of the total mass , box orbits become stochastic when their distance of closest approach to the center is @xmath113 times the half - mass radius of the model .",
    "resonances in triaxial potentials are less important at energies where the gravitational potential is dominated by the central black hole . in these central regions ,",
    "most of the boxlike orbits are regular and associated with a single non - resonant family .",
    "however resonant orbits still exist , including at least one family whose primary elongation is perpendicular to the short axis of the galaxy figure .",
    "the rates of many physical processes depend on the efficiency with which stars are supplied to the very center of a galaxy .",
    "examples are tidal disruption ( @xcite ) and accretion ( @xcite ) of stars by a black hole , transfer of energy from stars to a binary black hole ( @xcite ) , interaction of stars with an accretion disk ( @xcite ) , etc . in a triaxial galaxy",
    ", the rates of these processes would depend sensitively on the fraction of stars associated with resonant orbits .",
    "it is sometimes argued ( e.g. @xcite ) that the effectiveness of central density cusps or black holes at inducing changes in the orbital structure of a triaxial galaxy should be lessened by figure rotation , because the coriolis force in a rotating potential tends to make the box orbits `` centrophobic . '' as shown here , the regular box orbits even in a _",
    "non_rotating potential are generically centrophobic ; hence one might not expect figure rotation to have any great effect on their behavior .",
    "in fact a recent study ( @xcite ) finds that stochasticity becomes _ more _ prevalent as the rate of figure rotation is increased , apparently because the coriolis force tends to broaden orbits that would otherwise be thin , thus driving them into the center .",
    "as illustrated in figure 8 , one can compute fairly precisely the distance of closest approach to the potential center at which a regular box orbit becomes stochastic .",
    "this distance can be relatively large , of order @xmath114 the galaxy s half - mass radius , when the black hole contains @xmath84 the mass of the galaxy .",
    "it follows that the effect of a central mass on the orbital structure of a triaxial galaxy need not be strongly dependent on the spatial scale of the mass distribution .",
    "in fact , @xmath4-body simulations reveal that the response of an initially triaxial galaxy to a central accumulation of mass is essentially independent of whether the mass is distributed ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or concentrated in a point ( @xcite ) .",
