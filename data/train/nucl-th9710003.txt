    "in the late fifties it was pointed out by k. gottfried that after making a few approximations , the cross section for photoinduced two - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) knockout @xmath8 can be related to quantities that are sensitive to the relative and center - of - mass motion of nucleon pairs in the nuclear system @xcite . in this pioneering work",

    "momentum @xmath10 can be determined in terms of the momenta of the two escaping nucleons ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and the momentum transferred by the photon ( @xmath13 )  : @xmath14 it should be noted that as soon as one goes beyond the approximations that are at the basis of the gottfried approach , the differential cross sections can no longer be formally factorized in terms of the pair function and factors that depend on the relative motion of the active pair .",
    "this is for example the case when considering more realistic wave functions than plane waves for the outgoing nucleons .",
    "nevertheless , the dominant role of the pair function @xmath9 in the a@xmath15 and a@xmath16 processes has been experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "this observation raises confidence in that the @xmath17 reaction mechanism can be sufficiently kept under control to gain also empirical information about the relative motion of nucleon pairs in the medium .",
    "it is worth noting that also the measured @xmath3c@xmath18 @xcite and @xmath2o@xmath18 @xcite cross sections have recently been shown to scale in terms of the pair function @xmath9 .",
    "pioneering two - nucleon knockout studies with moderate energy resolution were performed at tokyo and bonn @xcite . in recent years , the pip - tof collaboration has collected a vast amount of 2n knockout data at the tagged photon facility of the 800  mev mainz electron accelerator . in comparison with earlier work ,",
    "these measurements are characterized by an improved energy resolution and cover a wide photon energy region ( @xmath19  mev ) .",
    "measurements with polarized photon beams on @xmath20he and @xmath3c are in the process of being analyzed .",
    "other experiments with polarized photon beams were performed for the target nuclei @xmath21he @xcite and @xmath2o @xcite at the legs facility located at the brookhaven national laboratory . in these experiments ,",

    ", a number of models to deal with two - nucleon knockout have been developed over the last couple of years .",
    "the models fall into different categories .",
    "the one developed by the valencia group @xcite aims at describing all the different aspects of the photon - nucleus coupling and pion final - state interactions in a unified diagrammatic approach .",
    "this includes all the ( multi-)pion and ( multi-)nucleon production channels . a very large amount of contributing mechanisms are included in the description of the pion and nucleon photoproduction channels .",
    "all this at the expense of the nuclear structure aspects of the reaction which are dealt with in a nuclear - matter approach .",
    "the local - density approximation ( lda ) is applied to obtain results for finite nuclei .",
    "the valencia calculations have been carefully compared to the @xmath31 data collected in recent years @xcite .",
    "generally a fair description of the missing energy spectra is obtained , an exception made for the @xmath16 channel for which the calculations tend to overestimate the data @xcite .",
    "a major conclusion from these comparisons is that for the photoabsorption mechanism to be two - body in nature one has to select these processes for which the @xmath32 fragment is created at low missing energies @xcite . at higher missing energies",
    "the two - nucleon knockout strength is predicted to be essentially due to initial @xmath33 production and subsequent pion final - state interactions .",
    "this implies that the higher missing energy range is excluded when studying the properties of dinucleons in the medium .",
    "indeed , in these studies it is essential to guarantee that only two nucleons participate in the reaction process .",
    "the models developed in pavia @xcite and gent @xcite are less ambitious as far as the number of included reaction mechanisms is concerned .",
    "they concentrating on the two - body photoabsorption mechanisms and do not include the pion production channels . in the light of the previous discussion ,",
    "these models are therefore restricted to the low missing energy part of the two - nucleon knockout spectra . in comparison with the valencia approach ,",
    "the gent and pavia models put more emphasis on a proper description of the nuclear structure aspects of the 2n emission reaction process . in both models ,",
    "the shell - model framework is the starting point to account for the nuclear structure aspects . in the light of 2n emission processes being a possible probe to study ground - state correlations ,",
    "the mean - field wave functions are corrected for ( central ) jastrow correlation effects . here",
    "we report on calculations that aim at investigating the dynamics of dinucleons in the medium with the aid of photoinduced two - nucleon knockout .",

    "indeed , when the situation occurs that the @xmath32 nucleus is created in the continuous part of its spectrum a summation over the momenta @xmath51 has to be carried out .    in all further considerations , the z axis is chosen along the direction of the incoming photon momentum .",

    "it is very well known that for photonenergies below 0.5  gev the cross sections and polarization observables for these reactions are fairly well understood in an effective langrangian approach retaining a selected class of diagrams @xcite .",

    "[ fig : twon ] , diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) and ( e ) correspond with genuine two - body photoabsorption , respectively related to meson - exchange ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and isobaric currents ( ( d ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "diagrams ( c ) and ( f ) are characterized by one - body photoabsorption with subsequent two - nucleon knockout and refer to final - state interactions and ground - state correlations respectively .",

    "[ fig : twon](a )  and  ( b ) are the standard pion - exchange current operators that can be derived from the one - pion exchange part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction through minimal substitution @xcite .",

    "the one - nucleon photoabsorption mechanism of figure  [ fig : twon](f ) would not contribute in a shell - model ( or independent particle ) picture of the target nucleus and refers to the situation in which one - body photoabsorption on a correlated pair forces two nucleons to escape . in principle , this process could be treated on the same footing as the other contributing diagrams .",
    "this would imply , however , that solely ground - state correlations induced by the one - pion exchange part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction are included .",
    "this is at odds with the widely spread belief that heavier meson exchange is the major source of ground - state correlations . generally , short - range effects are difficult to deal with in a diagrammatic approach .",
    "nevertheless , various techniques have been developed to cope with the complexity of the ground - state of an interacting fermion system . here , we resort to a semi - phenomenological approach to relate the results of these theoretical ground - state investigations with the cross sections and polarization observables for @xmath31 reactions .",
    "it consists of correcting the mean - field slater determinant @xmath76 with a jastrow - like correlation function : @xmath77 such an expansion mocks up two- , three- ,  a - body correlations . in the actual calculations only the central correlations of the two - body type are retained . as a matter of fact ,",
    "such an approximation amounts to correcting the product of the single - particle bound - state functions of the active nucleon - pair @xmath78 with a central correlation function : @xmath79 in an attempt to find out about the sensitivity of the @xmath31 angular cross sections and polarization observables to the ground - state correlations we have used several types of correlation functions in the calculations .",
    "the results of this paper will confirm the importance of the @xmath80 resonance in photoinduced two - nucleon knockout for photonenergies below 0.5  gev . as we consider photon energies in the resonance region special care",
    "must be taken in constructing the isobaric current operators related to intermediate @xmath81 creation of the type @xmath82 .",
    "a detailed account of the isobaric currents in the context of two - nucleon knockout reactions was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . as our model calculations start from the assumption that the pion is the major mediator between several nucleons , the @xmath83 interaction which enters in the construction of the isobaric currents is the pion exchange interaction .",
    "we now consider a simplified model for @xmath17 .",
    "two approximations are necessary for the angular ( @xmath84 ) cross section to factorize .",
    "first , a plane wave description for the escaping particles should be adopted .",
    "in addition , a severe assumption regarding the relative motion of the pairs has to be made in the sense that the decoupling of the c.m . and relative motion of the pair can formally only be achieved after the photon is assumed to couple to dinucleons residing in relative @xmath6 waves .",
    "this simplification is known as the `` quasi - deuteron '' approximation .",
    "this terminology might be a bit confusing in the sense that is used for both proton - proton and proton - neutron knockout .",
    "furthermore , the range of the relative @xmath6 wave is assumed to be small in comparison with all other mechanisms that play a role in the reaction process . from the technical point of view , this allows replacing the relative @xmath6 wave by a delta function ( known as the `` zero - range approximation '' ) , thus enormously simplifying the theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the `` zero - range approximation '' somehow implies that one simplifies the fermi motion in the relative wave function of the pair .",
    "the factorized scheme can be equally well applied to @xmath15 and @xmath16 reactions .",
    "the fact that solely the terms related to the ground - state correlations and a few pieces from the isobaric current contribute to the direct proton - proton knockout mechanism makes the factorized model to be particularly attractive as rather simple analytical expressions for the asymmetry and cross sections can be derived .",
