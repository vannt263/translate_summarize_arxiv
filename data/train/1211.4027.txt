    "the past few years have seen an increase in multi - epoch surveys specifically designed to probe the population of radio transients , as well as transient searches undertaken using archival data ( for a recent summary , see * ? ? ?",
    "transients can arise from processes taking place in a variety of progenitors @xcite , with typical timescales dictated by the characteristic processes causing the transient emission , and the sizes of the emitting regions .",
    "radio transients are generally classified as short ( characteristic timescales @xmath5s ) and long ( timescales @xmath6s ) , where the shorter timescales typically correspond to coherent emission processes and the longer timescales to incoherent emission @xcite .",
    "the timescales probed correspond to characteristic processes and size scales in the emitting objects , and so two surveys with differing temporal coverage will see a different mix of objects from each other .",
    "of particular interest for the current generation of radio sky surveys are tidal disruption events ( tdes )  flares connected to sudden increases in accretion rate caused when stars are tidally shredded as they pass close to black holes with mass @xmath7@xmath8  @xcite . such events may be the dominant contributor to transient source counts in the radio for surveys focusing on long duration transients @xcite .",
    "recently around 10 tde candidates have been detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by high energy surveys , of which some have been detected in radio - follow - up ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , no tdes have yet been unambiguously detected in blind radio surveys .",
    "other classes of sources that are expected to dominate blind transient surveys are radio supernovae , gamma ray burst afterglows , radio counterparts to gravitational wave sources such as neutron star mergers , flares from low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , and refraction and scintillation of extragalactic sources due to clumpiness and turbulence in our own galaxy s interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "some of the aforementioned source classes have been detected in follow - up of triggers at other wavelengths , but until recently , radio surveys have not had the required throughput to detect them blindly in significant numbers . some progenitors",
    "may only be detectable in the radio , however , and in other cases radio variability may be more extreme than variability at other wavelengths , making these sources easier to find .",
    "blind surveys also have the potential to serendipitously detect new classes of objects .",
    "some transient candidates have been detected in blind radio surveys , though  for example , those reported by @xcite , a large fraction of which remained undetected in deep optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite follow - up .",
    "a recent reanalysis of the @xcite  data by @xcite , however , suggests that some of these transients may be data artifacts , and the significance of some of the others may have been overestimated ( section  [ sec : falsepos ] ) .",
    "many other radio transient surveys may also have been somewhat overoptimistic in their claims of detections , particularly of sources seen in a single epoch and never again , and we urge appropriate skepticism . in this paper we discuss some of the safeguards we have implemented to ensure that any transients we detect have a high probability of being real .",
    "survey design involves trade - offs between a number of factors , including frequency , bandwidth , frequency resolution , spatial resolution , limiting sensitivity , sky area , number of epochs , cadence ( the time between epochs ) , integration time at each epoch , and galactic latitude .",
    "the number of transients detected by a survey depends on the lightcurves , radio spectra , luminosity functions , and distribution in galactic latitude and in distance , for a mix of different classes of progenitor , so comparing results from one survey to another is not trivial .",
    "for example , a survey with many epochs with a cadence of days might see different objects to a shallow large - area survey with fewer epochs with a timescale of months , even if the effective area covered ( the number of pointings , multiplied by the area covered by each pointing ) is similar .",
    "large area surveys with contiguous coverage have the advantage that sensitivity is approximately uniform across most of the resulting mosaic , whereas surveys with small numbers of pointings are more affected by primary beam falloff at the mosaic edges . small area surveys with many repeated epochs , however , have the advantage of allowing a deep comparison image to be constructed from all of the data .",
    "different authors also define `` transient '' in different ways , and as a result , measurements of transient surface densities ( sometimes referred to as `` two - epoch rates '' of transients per unit effective area ) from different surveys may not be directly comparable .",
    "the sensitivity of a given survey is particularly critical in influencing the number of transients seen ; a transient seen in one survey may be classified as a variable source by a more sensitive survey if detected in additional epochs .",
    "we suggest that a sensible threshold for a source to be considered a transient is that it brightens by a factor of at least ten[sec : fac10 ] .",
    "[ sec : factor10]the distinction between transient and variable sources is always somewhat arbitrary , but we pick this threshold to distinguish between sources that would be detected in quiescence with a modest increase in sensitivity ( e.g. , variable agns ) and those that brighten more dramatically due to some explosive event ( e.g. sne ) , very significant changes in accretion rate ( e.g. , tdes ) , and the like . as shown in @xcite , and in section  [ sec : maxfracmod ] , a few percent of sources exhibit apparent variability of a factor of a few , but almost none of these `` normal '' variables exhibit variations of an order of magnitude or more in flux .",
    "the choice of a factor 10 for transient detection naturally limits the sensitivity of any two - epoch survey to around @xmath9 ( for a source to be undetected at @xmath10 in one image , and to change in flux density by a factor of 10 or more on its detection in the other image ) .",
    "it should also be noted that explosive events may occur within galaxies that are themselves radio sources ( for example , radio galaxies ) .",
    "if the spatial resolution is not sufficient to distinguish between the two sources of radio emission , then the explosive event will not be characterized as a transient , by our definition , unless it is at least nine times brighter than the emission from the host galaxy .",
    "this will also tend to reduce the amount of variability seen by surveys like ours ( with relatively low spatial resolution ) where extended non - variable emission is unresolved from variable sources such as radio galaxy cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the distinction between transient and variable sources aside ( which is of most importance in comparing transient statistics between surveys ) it is of course still of interest to study sources which exhibit large changes in flux density , and we remark upon some of these extreme variables , as well as analyzing variability statistics for large numbers of sources , in section  [ sec : variability ] .",
    "if we consider a multi - epoch survey with a detection threshold of @xmath11 for a transient in an individual epoch , and a @xmath12 upper limit in a deep comparison image made from all observations of the same field ( with @xmath13 for @xmath14 epochs ) , we see that to detect transients close to the threshold ( where @xmath15 ) requires 25 or more epochs",
    ". such repeated observations of the same field ( as opposed to using the allocated observing time to increase the area of the survey while maintaining shallower depth ) also have the advantage of allowing us to extract multi - epoch lightcurves for sources of interest , and to make images from subsets of the data with different timescales .",
    "repeated observations of the same field also allow us to disentangle intrinsic variability from telescope calibration errors .",
    "however , these requirements must be balanced against the fact that quadrupling the area covered by a survey at the expense of doubling the detection threshold should result in an increase of the number of transients detected of @xmath16 ( naively assuming an @xmath17 dependence of rates on flux density , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the tradeoff between depth and area must also be balanced with the desire to obtain adequate sampling for the timescales of interest .    some surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use a deep comparison field that was taken a long time ( compared to the timescales of interest ) before the survey data . for surveys which use their own data to generate a deep field",
    ", there is an additional complication .",
    "transients that are bright , or those that are detected in more than a few of the individual images , will also contribute significant flux to the deep image , potentially resulting in a detection even when no long - term counterpart is present .      the reassessment of the @xcite transients by @xcite ; and of the @xcite transients by @xcite and @xcite ; as well as questions raised by @xcite about transients such as those seen by @xcite ; and about the @xcite transients by @xcite , illustrate that events detected only in a single epoch have a significant chance of being spurious .",
    "in fact many current transient searches may be operating in an uncomfortable regime where the number of false positive detections is larger than the number of true transients .",
    "spurious sources in imaging searches can arise due to amplification of noise by overly large primary beam gain corrections ; from various image artifacts including sidelobes of bright sources and corrupted data ; or simply due to thresholds that are overly optimistic .",
    "the latter can occur because the large area surveyed means that even rare events are seen occasionally ; because underestimates of the background noise cause the significance of detections to be overestimated ; or because the assumption of gaussian noise is not valid ( which it may not be in the presence of artifacts as well as non - linear imaging algorithms such as clean ) .",
    "if the primary beam is well - known , relatively conservative gain cutoffs are easy to implement ; in this paper we discard sources where the primary beam correction is greater than a factor 5 ( section  [ sec : biggain ] ) .    to have the best chance of finding real transients , we must carefully choose thresholds to lower the number of false positives .",
    "one way is to choose a very conservative threshold , perhaps 8  @xmath19 , in individual epoch images ( and look for counterparts at any flux density in the deep image ) .",
    "however , the assumed @xmath17 dependence of rates on flux density , @xmath18 , means that high thresholds also sacrifice a lot of sensitivity to potential transients .",
    "a better method ( section  [ sec : dualimageimp ] ) is to split the @xmath20  data in half and create two separate images , which are then searched simultaneously for candidates appearing in the same place .",
    "noise peaks will tend not to coincide in two images , and since sidelobes and other image defects also often do not coincide , this method can also reduce the number of false positives due to artifacts .",
    "the data can be halved in a variety of ways  in time , frequency , or by taking subsets of baselines , for example . then the catalog can be generated with a lower threshold in both images ( @xmath21 , in our case ) .",
    "this will result in relatively large numbers of spurious sources , but any source not appearing in both images is then discarded , resulting in a comparatively clean catalog with a @xmath22 threshold . for",
    "the number of independent beams searched , the probability of a single source appearing in our catalogs above this threshold due to random gaussian noise is 0.7% ; as noted above , however , artifacts or other imaging defects can still easily result in the presence of spurious detections above this threshold .    the observing strategy used for pigss",
    "( two correlators delivering adjacent frequency bands ) lends itself naturally to the two - image approach , but it could be applied by other telescopes with a single correlator too , by dividing the data up in some way before imaging . dividing in frequency",
    "may of course miss transients with very steep spectral indices , and dividing in time reduces sensitivity to rapid variability , but in such cases more than one method of halving the data could be used , and the catalogs checked against each other.[sec : dualimageint ] we discuss our implementation of this method in section  [ sec : dualimageimp ] .",
    "the allen telescope array ( ata ; * ? ? ? * ) , is a 42-element interferometer , located at hat creek radio observatory in northern california .",
    "each element is a 6.1-m dish with a broadband feed that receives radiation from 0.5 to 11ghz .",
    "two independently - tunable correlators select bands of 104mhz width , each consisting of 1024 channels , from anywhere in this frequency range .",
    "the maximum baseline is 300 m , yielding resolution @xmath23  at @xmath3ghz .",
    "typical system equivalent flux densities at @xmath3ghz for antennas that are performing as expected are @xmath24jy .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented results from a pilot program , the ata twenty - centimeter survey ( atats ) .",
    "they compared the resulting catalogs to those from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a survey also at 1.4ghz undertaken with the vla between 1993 and 1997 .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper i , introduced a larger ata survey , the pi ghz sky survey ( pigss ) .",
    "pigss covered @xmath25 square degrees  in two epochs , and an additional @xmath25 square degrees  in a single epoch , in two simultaneous 100mhz bands centered at 3.04 and 3.14ghz ( croft et  al .  in prep . ) . as well as the large field , pigss also incorporates four smaller ( @xmath26 square degree ) fields observed with a cadence of days .",
    "paper i  presents results from a deep image made from 75 epochs of observation of one of these fields ( centered on the location of the noao deep wide field survey , ndwfs ) .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper ii , compares catalogs generated from the individual epochs of this field ( and monthly averages of them ) to each other , and to other radio @xcite , infrared @xcite , and x - ray @xcite catalogs .    in this paper , we present results from the other three 12 square degree  deep fields , centered on the elais - n1 , lockman hole , and coma fields ( table  [ tab : fields ] ) , as well as a partial reanalysis of the ndwfs results from paper ii  to conform with updated analysis techniques used on the other three fields .",
    "the elais - n1 and lockman fields were selected due to the availability of large amounts of deep imaging and spectroscopic coverage from other telescopes .",
    "the coma field also has extensive multi - wavelength coverage , and in addition the wide - field of the ata enabled our survey to include a large number of low - redshift galaxies in the coma cluster , as opposed to the higher - redshift galaxies in the other fields .",
    "all four fields are at high galactic latitude ( @xmath27 ) and as such primarily target extragalactic transients ; results from another recent ata survey primarily targeting galactic transients are reported by @xcite .",
    "most existing transient surveys have focussed on frequencies in the 1  2ghz range , with typical cadences rather longer than used for our observations , and so pigss provides a unique view of the transient and variable radio sky .",
    "we place a particular emphasis here on techniques that will be scalable to the next generation of imaging surveys , where processing and analysis must take place with an increasing degree of automation due to the very large data volumes involved . although pigss is still ( just ) at a scale where manual processing is possible , we focused on developing routines to reject bad data both before and after the imaging stage , and on understanding our results in the context of other surveys , both past and future .",

    "the pigss observations reported here were undertaken approximately daily between 2009 december and 2011 april , in campaigns lasting several months for each field ( table  [ tab : fields ] ) .",
    "we attempted to observe all seven pointings for each field for three minutes , three times , distributed in hour angle so as to optimize @xmath20  coverage , during the 4  12hr allocated to each pigss epoch .",
    "as in paper i , pointings were separated by 47 , the voltage fwhm at 3.14ghz , to provide approximately uniform sensitivity in the central region of the field .",
    "data were taken in two 100mhz bands centered at 3.04 and 3.14ghz , each covering 1024 channels .",
    "one of the bright calibrators 3c286 , 3c48 , or 3c147 was observed hourly .",
    "bad data arose from a variety of sources : radio frequency interference ( rfi ) ; clock synchronization problems ; walsh system problems ; temperature related problems for individual boards ( particularly radio frequency converter boards ) causing spectral corruption ; antennas that were offline or had problems with feeds ; and other issues , known and unknown .",
    "most problems except rfi were relatively infrequent and typically affected a single epoch of data .",
    "rfi occurred in essentially all datasets , both as narrow - band spikes ( relatively easy to excise ) and wide - band rfi affecting a larger number of frequency channels . identifying and excising ( `` flagging '' ) these bad data in an efficient",
    ", automatic manner is important for large surveys like ours where the large amount of data makes pipeline processing essential .",
    "flagging was performed by miriad @xcite tasks wrapped in our own custom perl pipeline ( `` autoflag '' ) which expands and improves upon the earlier rapid / artis @xcite ata data reduction software .",
    "the autoflag software computes the median and variance of the real and imaginary values for each channel / polarization / baseline combination in each single - epoch dataset as a function of time .",
    "channels where more than 60%  of the visibilities deviate by more than four standard deviations from the median values , as well as their immediate neighboring channels , are flagged as suspected rfi .",
    "additionally , individual visibilities that are more than @xmath19 from the median amplitude are flagged .",
    "to flag wide - band rfi , spectra are binned ( using a range of bin sizes ) and bins with excessive variance ( three or more times the median ) are flagged , on a baseline by baseline basis .",
    "where exactly one quarter of the channels in spectra associated with a particular antenna show large variance , spectral corruption is suspected and the channels are flagged on all baselines associated with that antenna .",
    "baselines are also flagged if calibrator phases show excessive ( @xmath36 radian ) variability .",
    "baselines shorter than 110 wavelengths ( which tended to be subject to solar interference ) , along with 100 channels at each edge of the band ( due to filter roll - off ) and the central dc channel were also flagged .",
    "the visibility retention ( the percentage of cross - correlations for each dataset remaining after all flagging ) ranged from 1%  to 78% .",
    "93%  of datasets had retention of at least 65% .",
    "fields with poor retention often showed obvious defects after imaging , or failed to image entirely ; such fields were excluded from further analysis .",
    "where multiple calibrators were used , the primary calibrator was taken to be the one with the most unflagged data , and the reference antenna was taken to be the one with the most unflagged visibilities in the primary calibrator data .",
    "initial calibration was performed using mfcal with flux densities from @xcite , and then amplitudes which deviated by more than 4jy from the nominal flux density , and phases which deviated by more than 20 , were flagged in the calibrator data .",
    "a second round of mfcal was performed , bandpass solutions were copied to the other calibrators ( if present ) , and mfcal was run on these calibrators to obtain a gain solution . the gain and",
    "bandpass solutions were copied to the target data from the primary calibrator , and the gain solutions for the other calibrators ( if present ) were merged into the target data .",
    "no polarization calibration was performed .    at each pointing ,",
    "images of @xmath37 pixels , where each pixel is @xmath38 , were produced , using natural weighting and multi - frequency synthesis . in order to produce mosaics ,",
    "the ` mosaic ' option was used with the invert command , and the ` offset ' keyword used to set the reference coordinate for all seven pointings to a single position at the center of the mosaic .",
    "if these steps are not performed , miriad linmos does not correctly handle the sky projection when mosaics are produced , resulting in offsets between ata positions and the standard reference frame .",
    "this was the cause of the offsets between ata and nvss positions seen in paper i , which are corrected here in our reanalysis .",
    "an initial clean was performed down to the first negative component , and sources in the resulting map were found using the miriad source finder , sfind .",
    "the output image from sfind was convolved with the dirty beam , and pixels below @xmath19 were blanked .",
    "this image was then used as a mask for a second round of clean ( on the image which had already been cleaned down to the first negative component ) , which continued until a cutoff of 5mjy or 5000 iterations was reached .",
    "the two stage clean ameliorates non - linear behavior in clean , and essentially performs more iterations on sources brighter than @xmath19 in the initial image .    if sources brighter than 500mjy were present in the field , amplitude self - calibration was performed , and then the image was inverted and cleaned again .",
    "the final image was restored using a @xmath39 gaussian beam .",
    "this reduction process generated over 6000 images  two ( one for each frequency band ) for each of the seven mosaic pointings at each of the tens of epochs for each of the four fields .",
    "we computed the background rms for each of these images using a skewed gaussian fit to the pixel histogram , with iterative clipping to remove source pixels .",
    "those of the @xmath40 datasets which resulted in images with rms @xmath41mjy  beam@xmath42  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rmshist ] ) were considered to be good datasets , for the purposes of creating deep images ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lockmandeep ] , [ fig : elaisdeep ] , and [ fig : comadeep ] ; except that the ndwfs deep image was constructed using the same single - epoch datasets used in paper i ) .",
    "one image was made for each pointing for each frequency in each field . due to small variations in image quality , the number of epochs which satisfied the 3.5mjy  beam@xmath42  threshold varied by @xmath43%  across the seven pointings , resulting in slight ( @xmath44% ) variations in limiting sensitivity across the mosaic , which we neglect in subsequent analysis . in table",
    "[ tab : fields ] , we report the median number of epochs that went into each pointing .    the resulting seven all - epoch single - pointing images at each frequency were linearly combined into two all - epoch single frequency band `` master mosaics '' , using a tapered primary beam correction in linmos .",
    "we also linearly combined these pairs of mosaic images into a dual - frequency mosaic for each field .",
    "in addition to these three deep images for each of the fields , we made seven - pointing mosaic images of each epoch at each frequency , and linearly combined these into a dual - frequency mosaic for each field .",
    "typical images , here defined as mosaics with the median completeness ( section  [ sec : completeness ] ) for each field , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lockmantyp ] , [ fig : elaistyp ] , and [ fig : comatyp ] .",
    "we also made seven - pointing mosaics of all good data taken in a given month for each field , again inverting data for each pointing separately , and mosaicking in the image domain with a tapered primary beam .",
    "reprojection to an equal - area coordinate system is necessary for large mosaics , in order that flux densities are measured correctly .",
    "however , for the relatively small fields studied here this effect is negligible ( @xmath45%  variation in pixel area in the default sin projection ) , and we chose not to reproject in order to avoid possible aliasing as well as the additional processing required .",
    "the single - epoch , single - pointing images had a median rms of 2.42mjy ( compared to theoretical expectations of @xmath46mjy ) .",
    "the single - epoch mosaics had a median rms of 2.02mjy .",
    "the monthly images had a median rms of 0.43mjy .",
    "the deep images had rms of a few hundred @xmath0jy  ( as expected when scaling the rms of the individual images by the square root of the number of epochs ) , as shown in table  [ tab : fields ] .",
    "the elais - n1 field reaches a sensitivity close to our estimate ( paper ii ) of the rms confusion limit , @xmath47@xmath0jy .",
    "image quality can be assessed in a variety of ways .",
    "we inspected all of the images by hand to ensure that selecting particular methods and thresholds did not inadvertently result in the inclusion of bad data ( or the exclusion of significant amounts of good data ) .",
    "for the next generation of large surveys , however , inspecting more than a small fraction of the images will become impractical .",
    "fortunately , good images have certain characteristics : they have noise that is reasonably low , they contain a reasonable number of real sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfindhist ] ) , and the sources have reasonable flux densities .",
    "as discussed above , we generated deep field images based on the noise measured in images made from data for individual pointings , keeping only images with rms noise @xmath48mjy  beam@xmath42 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmshist ] , and in table  [ tab : fields ] , around 85%  of the elais and coma single - epoch images satisfy this criterion , and around 65%  of the lockman images .",
    "some epochs have rms higher than this cutoff , but can nevertheless be used to search for transients and variable sources , whereas a handful of epochs are completely unusable .    to determine transient source counts or limits we wish to determine the effective area covered by the survey as a function of completeness limit ( section  [ sec : completeness ] ) .",
    "images which appear cosmetically very poor ( some of which also contain spurious sources in the catalogs as a result of image defects ) will also tend to have poor completeness limits . for our transient search ,",
    "we discard epochs where 90%  completeness is not reached by 50mjy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comphist ] ) .",
    "the number of epochs surviving these cuts for each field are shown in the `` transients '' column in table  [ tab : fields ] .    to measure variability ,",
    "we require relatively good completeness for all images , as well as reliably measured flux densities . for our variability analysis",
    ", we adopt a completeness threshold of 50mjy , and require post imaging calibration gain corrections ( section  [ sec : picgain ] ) within @xmath49 of the median value for that field .",

    "source detection , matching , catalog creation , source databases and matching , and lightcurve and postage stamp creation were performed by our custom software known as `` slow '' , a suite of python and perl scripts calling miriad routines and building and querying sqlite3 databases .",
    "slow first runs miriad sfind on the master mosaic and on the single - epoch mosaics .",
    "we used sfind s false detection rate ( fdr ) algorithm @xcite with a box size of 50 pixels , and the default 2%  acceptable percentage of false pixels .",
    "this corresponds to a detection threshold of around @xmath50 .",
    "the `` psfsize '' option was used , which restricts the minimum fitted size of sources to the size of the restoring beam ; without this option , some sources in the single - epoch images tend to be fit by ellipses with minor axis @xmath51 , causing their flux densities to be underestimated relative to those from the master mosaic .",
    "sources poorly fit by sfind ( indicated by asterisks in the sfind output ) , typically comprising @xmath3%  of the total sources detected in each epoch , were rejected from the catalog .",
    "we computed total flux density uncertainties by adding the reported background rms and fit uncertainties from sfind in quadrature .",
    "we corrected the attenuation at the edge of the mosaics by creating a gain map for each epoch in linmos , and correcting the measured flux densities and uncertainties in the catalogs for the appropriate gains ( since sfind s built - in primary beam correction does not work for linear mosaics ) .",
    "sources in regions with gain corrections greater than a factor 5 were discarded from the catalog[sec : biggain ] .",
    "this helps to minimize the problem of noise variations close to image edges with large gain corrections being interpreted as real sources .",
    "sources were added to the database one epoch at a time , and paired with existing sources if there was a match within 150 .",
    "the full sqlite3 databases are available from the first author on request .",
    "we performed a modified version of the post - imaging calibration ( pic ) of @xcite on our catalogs .",
    "sources in the individual epoch catalogs were matched to those from the master catalog , and a linear least squares fit to the primary beam corrected flux densities was performed .",
    "an ordinary least squares fit ( with weights given by the image uncertainties ) gives good results for the majority of epochs , but we were concerned that real variations in source flux densities could cause some epochs to have poor fits . while this should not be a problem for transient detection ( since transients will not have a match in the master catalog ) , sources with extreme flux density variations could cause poor fits . to test this , we made a copy of the slow database which we then manipulated for testing purposes .",
    "for a source detected in most of the individual epochs , and also detected in the master mosaic with flux density 15mjy , we increased its cataloged flux value at each individual epoch to 1000mjy , and then ran the fitting procedure again .",
    "figure  [ fig : ransac ] shows data from a typical epoch , where this artificially modified source ( designed to simulate an extreme variable or a source with an erroneous flux density measurement in real data ) causes the least squares fit to fail .",
    "performing a ransac fit @xcite , however , results in fits to the data which are very robust to outliers , and so we adopt this technique for all of our fits . no sources in our data show variations in flux density as extreme as our simulated example , so our fits should describe the data very well .    if we fit for both the slope and intercept , we find that the absolute value of the median intercepts are @xmath52mjy for the lockman and elais - n1 fields at both frequencies , which suggests that clean bias is not significant . for the coma field , median intercepts are @xmath53mjy .",

    "one of the sources , detected with 19.4mjy in the master catalog , has had its flux density in the single epoch catalog manipulated to make it into an outlier with 1000mjy , in order to test the robustness of our fitting procedure . the dashed line shows the results of a weighted linear least squares fit : a slope of 0.75 , and an intercept of 33mjy , which were influenced by this single outlier .",
    "the solid line shows the ransac fit : slope 1.03 , and intercept -2mjy , which are more representative of the inliers in the dataset .",

    "blind surveys covering more than an order of magnitude greater effective area ought to begin to detect such events if theoretical predictions are correct .",
    "we discuss a number of caveats to be aware of in the search for transient and variable sources , and note in particular that the rejection of data from bad epochs ( for example , by examining post - imaging calibration fits of the single - epoch flux densities to those from the deep comparison image , and by rejecting epochs with poor completeness ) as well as rejection of image defects and other spurious sources which do not obey simple gaussian statistics ( in particular , by considering only sources that are detected in images made from neighboring frequency bands or from data split in some other way ) are critically important in the regime where the potential false positive rate is large compared to the true rate of candidates of interest .",
    "we also note that some of the sources which appear most variable in our survey ( and perhaps in others ) appear variable because of discrepant flux density measurements in only one of our two frequencies , further reinforcing the dangers of relying on single flux density measurements without a simultaneous second confirming measurement .",

    "<S> we present results from a total of 459 repeated 3.1ghz radio continuum observations ( of which 379 were used in a search for transient sources ) of the elais - n1 , coma , lockman hole , and noao deep wide field survey fields as part of the pi ghz sky survey ( pigss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were taken approximately once per day between 2009 may and 2011 april . </S>",
    "<S> each image covers 11.8  square degrees  and has 100  fwhm resolution . </S>",
    "<S> deep images for each of the four fields have rms noise between 180 and 310@xmath0jy , and the corresponding catalogs contain @xmath1 sources in each field . typically 40  50 of these sources are detected in each single - epoch image . </S>",
    "<S> this represents one of the shortest cadence , largest area , multi - epoch surveys undertaken at these frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare the catalogs generated from the combined images to those from individual epochs , and from monthly averages , as well as to legacy surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we undertake a search for transients , with particular emphasis on excluding false positive sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find no confirmed transients , defined here as sources that can be shown to have varied by at least a factor 10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find one source which brightened in a single - epoch image to at least six times the upper limit from the corresponding deep image . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a source associated with a @xmath2 quasar which appears to have brightened by a factor @xmath3 in one of our deep images , when compared to catalogs from legacy surveys .    </S>",
    "<S> we place new upper limits on the number of transients brighter than 10mjy : fewer than 0.08 transients deg@xmath4 with characteristic timescales of months to years ; fewer than 0.02 deg@xmath4 with timescales of months ; and fewer than 0.009 deg@xmath4 with timescales of days . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot upper limits as a function of flux density for transients on the same timescales . </S>"
