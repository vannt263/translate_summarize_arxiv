    "what do we mean by an optical circuit ?",
    "we can think of a black box with incoming and outgoing modes of the electro - magnetic field .",
    "the black box transforms a state of the incoming modes into a ( different ) state of the outgoing modes .",
    "the black box is what we call an _",
    "optical circuit_. we can now take a more detailed look inside the black box .",
    "we will consider three types of components .",
    "first , the modes might be mixed by beam - splitters , or they may pick up a relative phase shift or polarisation rotation .",
    "these operations all belong to a class of optical components which preserve the photon number .",
    "we call them _ passive _ optical components .",
    "secondly , we may find optical components such as lasers , down - converters or ( optical ) parametric amplifiers in the black box .",
    "these components can be viewed as photon sources , since they do not leave the photon number invariant .",
    "we will call these components _ active _ optical components .    and",
    "finally , the box will generally include measurement devices , the outcomes of which may modify optical components on the remaining modes depending on the detection outcomes .",
    "this is called _ feed - forward _ detection .",
    "we can immediately simplify optical circuits using feed - forward detection , by considering the family of fixed circuits corresponding to the set of measurement outcomes ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", we can postpone the measurement to the end , where all the optical components have ` acted ' on the modes .",
    "these three component types have their own characteristic mathematical description .",
    "a passive component yields a unitary evolution @xmath0 , which can be written as @xmath1 where h.c .",
    "denotes the hermitian conjugate .",
    "this unitary evolution commutes with the total number operator @xmath2 .",
    "active components also correspond to unitary transformations , which can be written as @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the interaction hamiltonian associated with the @xmath5 active component in a sequence .",
    "this hamiltonian does not necessarily commute with the total number operator . to make a typographical distinction between passive and active components",
    ", we denote the @xmath6 passive component by @xmath0 , and the @xmath5 active component by its evolution in terms of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the mathematical description of the ( ideal ) measurement will correspond to taking the inner product of the outgoing state prior to the measurement with the eigenstate corresponding to the measurement .",
    "now that we have the components of an optical circuit of @xmath7 modes , we have to combine them into an actual circuit .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to applying the unitary evolutions of the successive components to the input state .",
    "let @xmath8 be the input state and @xmath9 the output state _",
    "prior _ to the measurement .",
    "we then have ( with @xmath10 some integer ) @xmath11 where it should be noted that @xmath0 might be the identity operator @xmath12 or a product of unitary transformations corresponding to passive components : @xmath13 when the ( multi - mode ) eigenstate corresponding to the measurement outcome for a limited set of modes labelled @xmath14 with @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the number of detected modes out of a total of @xmath7 modes , and @xmath18 the number of photons found in mode @xmath19 , the state leaving the optical circuit in the undetected modes is given by @xmath20    in this paper , we study the outgoing states @xmath21 for a special class of optical circuits .",
    "first , we assume that the input state is the vacuum on all modes .",
    "thus , we effectively study optical circuits as state preparation devices .",
    "secondly , our class of optical circuits include all possible passive components , but _ only _ active components with quadratic interaction hamiltonians : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is some complex symmetric matrix .",
    "this matrix determines the behaviour of the @xmath5 active component , which can be any combination of down - converters and squeezers .",
    "finally , we consider ideal photo - detection , where the eigenstate corresponding to the measurement outcome can be written as @xmath24 .",
    "the class of optical circuits we consider here is not the most general class , but it still includes important experiments like quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite and the demonstration of ghz correlations @xcite . in section [ example ]",
    "we show how teleportation can be modelled using the methods presented here .",
    "the state @xmath25 prior to the photo - detection can be written in terms of the components of the optical circuit as @xmath26 the creation and annihilation operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 for mode @xmath19 satisfy the standard canonical commutation relations @xmath29",
    "= \\delta_{ij } \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad    [ \\hat{a}_i,\\hat{a}_j ] = [ \\hat{a}_i^{\\dagger},\\hat{a}_j^{\\dagger } ] = 0\\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath30 .    for any unitary evolution @xmath31",
    ", we have the relation @xmath32 furthermore , if @xmath31 is due to a collection of only passive components , such an evolution leaves the vacuum invariant : @xmath33 . using these two properties",
    "it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ incoming ] ) can be written as @xmath34 |0\\rangle\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 is some complex symmetric matrix .",
    "we will now simplify this expression by normal - ordering this evolution .",
    "define @xmath36 . as shown by braunstein @xcite",
    ", we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ in2 ] ) using two passive unitary transformations @xmath31 and @xmath37 as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a diagonal matrix with real non - negative eigenvalues @xmath40 .",
    "this means that , starting from vacuum , the class of optical circuits we consider here is equivalent to a set of single - mode squeezers , followed by a passive unitary transformation @xmath31 and photo - detection .",
    "since @xmath39 is diagonal , we can write eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) as @xmath41\\right )    |0\\rangle\\ ; .\\ ] ] we can now determine the normal ordering of every factor @xmath42 $ ] separately . note that the operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 generate an su(1,1 ) algebra .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , this may be normal - ordered as @xmath46 where @xmath47 . in general , when @xmath48 and @xmath49 are generators of an @xmath50 algebra ( i.e. , when @xmath35 is unitary ) we find @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 a complex coupling constant and @xmath53 its orientation in the complex plane .",
    "when we now apply this operator to the vacuum , the annihilation operators will vanish , leaving only the exponential function of the creation operators .",
    "we thus have @xmath54 with @xmath55 , again by virtue of the invariance property of the vacuum .",
    "this is the state of the interferometer prior to photo - detection .",
    "it corresponds to _ multi - mode squeezed vacuum_.    the photo - detection itself can be modelled by successive application of annihilation operators .",
    "every annihilation operator @xmath28 removes a photon in mode @xmath19 from the state @xmath25 .",
    "suppose the optical circuit employs @xmath7 distinct modes .",
    "we will now detect @xmath17 modes , finding @xmath56 photons ( with @xmath15 ) .",
    "these modes can be relabelled 1 to @xmath17 .",
    "the vector @xmath57 denotes the particular detector ` signature ' : @xmath58 means that @xmath59 photons are detected in mode 1 , @xmath60 in mode 2 , and so on .",
    "the freely propagating outgoing state @xmath61 can then be described as @xmath62 here , @xmath63 .",
    "at this point we find it convenient to introduce the @xmath7-mode bargmann representation @xcite . the creation and annihilation operators obey the commutation relations given in eq .",
    "( [ comm ] ) .",
    "we can replace these operators with c - numbers and their derivatives according to @xmath64 the commutation relations then read @xmath65 = \\delta_{ij } \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad   [ \\partial_i,\\partial_j ] = [ \\alpha_i,\\alpha_j ] = 0\\ ; .\\ ] ] note that the actual values of @xmath66 are irrelevant ( the creation and annihilation operators do not have numerical values either ) ; what matters here is the functional relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    the state created by the optical circuit in this representation ( prior to the detections , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ in3 ] ) ) in the bargmann representation is @xmath68   = \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{ij}\\alpha_i b_{ij}\\alpha_j \\right]\\ ; .\\ ] ] returning to eq .",
    "( [ det ] ) , we can write the freely propagating state after detection of the auxiliary modes in the bargmann representation as @xmath69 up to some normalisation factor , where @xmath70 . by setting @xmath71",
    "we ensure that _ no more _ that @xmath18 photons are present in mode @xmath19 .",
    "it plays the role of the vacuum bra in eq .",
    "( [ det ] ) .    now that we have an expression for the freely propagating state emerging from our optical setup after detection , we seek to simplify it .",
    "we can multiply @xmath72 by the identity operator @xmath73 , written as @xmath74   \\ ; \\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\vec\\alpha , b\\vec\\alpha)\\right]\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the total number of detected photons .",
    "we then find the following expression for the unnormalised freely propagating state created by our optical circuit : @xmath76    now we introduce the so - called _ multi - dimensional _ hermite polynomial , or mdhp for short : @xmath77 the use of multi - dimensional hermite polynomials and hermite polynomials of two variables have previously been used to describe @xmath7-dimensional first - order systems @xcite and photon statistics @xcite .",
    "here , we have shown that the lowest order of the _ outgoing _ state of optical circuits with quadratic components ( as described by eq .",
    "( [ in2 ] ) ) and conditional photo - detection can be expressed directly in terms of an mdhp .    in physical systems ,",
    "the coupling constants ( the @xmath40 s ) are usually very small ( i.e. , @xmath78 or possibly @xmath79 ) .",
    "this means that for all practical purposes only the first order term in eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) is important ( i.e. , for small @xmath40 s we can approximate the exponential by 1 ) . consequently , studying the multi - dimensional hermite polynomials yield knowledge about the typical states we can produce using gaussian sources without coherent displacements . in section [ hp ] we take a closer look at these polynomials , but first we consider the description of quantum teleportation in this representation .",
    "as an example of how to determine the outgoing state of an optical circuit , consider the teleportation experiment by bouwmeester _ et al_.   @xcite .",
    "the optical circuit corresponding to this experiment consists of eight incoming modes , all in the vacuum state .",
    "physically , there are four spatial modes @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , all with two polarisation components @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "two down - converters create entangled polarisation states ; they belong to the class of active gaussian components without coherent displacements .",
    "mode @xmath80 undergoes a polarisation rotation over an angle @xmath86 and modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 are mixed in a 50:50 beam - splitter .",
    "finally , modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 emerging from the beam - splitter are detected with polarisation insensitive detectors and mode @xmath80 is detected using a polarisation sensitive detector .",
    "the state which is to be teleported is therefore given by @xmath87    the state prior to the detection and normal ordering ( corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ stateprior ] ) ) is given by ( @xmath52 is a coupling constant ) @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath92 |0\\rangle\\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath93 and @xmath35 the ( symmetric ) matrix @xmath94 we now have to find the normal ordering of eq .",
    "( [ priorstate ] ) .",
    "since @xmath35 is unitary , the polynomial @xmath95 is a generator of an @xmath50 algebra . according to truax @xcite",
    ", the normal ordering of the exponential thus yields a state @xmath96 |0\\rangle\\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath97 . the lowest order contribution after three detected photons is due to the term @xmath98 .",
    "however , first we write eq .",
    "( [ telprior ] ) in the bargmann representation : @xmath99\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the polarisation independent photo - detection is then modelled by the differentiation @xmath102 . given a detector hit in mode @xmath103 , the polarisation sensitive detection of mode @xmath80",
    "is modelled by @xmath104 : @xmath105 \\right|_{\\vec{\\alpha}'=0}\\ ; .\\ ] ] the outgoing state in the bargmann representation is thus given by @xmath106 which is the state teleported from mode @xmath80 to mode @xmath83 in the bargmann representation .",
    "this procedure essentially amounts to evaluating the multi - dimensional hermite polynomial @xmath107 .",
    "note that the polarisation independent detection of modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 yield a _ superposition _ of the mdhp s .",
    "the one - dimensional hermite polynomials are of course well known from the description of the linear harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics",
    ". these polynomials may be obtained from a generating function @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , there exist two recursion relations and an orthogonality relation between them .",
    "the theory of multi - dimensional hermite polynomials with real variables has been developed by appell and kemp de friet @xcite and in the bateman project @xcite .",
    "mizrahi derived an expression for real mdhp s from an @xmath109-dimensional generalisation of the rodriguez formula @xcite",
    ". we will now give the generating function for the complex mdhp s given by eq .",
    "( [ mdhp ] ) and consecutively derive the recursion relations and the orthogonality relation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "define the generating function @xmath110 to be @xmath111 @xmath110 gives rise to the mdhp in eq .",
    "( [ mdhp ] ) , which determines this particular choice .",
    "note that the inner product @xmath112 does not involve any complex conjugation .",
    "if complex conjugation was involved , we would have obtained different polynomials ( which we could also have called multi - dimensional hermite polynomials , but they would not bear the same relationship to optical circuits ) .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we use the following notation : by @xmath113 we mean that the @xmath5 entry of the vector @xmath114 is lowered by one , thus becoming @xmath115 . by differentiation of both sides of the generating function in eq .",
    "( [ genfunc ] ) we can thus show that the first recursion relation becomes @xmath116    the second recursion relation is given by @xmath117 which can be proved by mathematical induction using @xmath118 here , we have chosen @xmath119 .",
    "the orthogonality relation is somewhat more involved .",
    "ultimately , we want to use this relation to determine the normalisation constant of the states given by eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) . to find this normalisation we have to evaluate the integral @xmath120 the state @xmath121 includes @xmath122 , which translates into a delta - function @xmath123 in the integrand .",
    "the relevant integral thus becomes @xmath124^ * h_{\\vec{m}}^b ( \\vec\\alpha)\\ ,   \\delta(\\vec\\alpha')\\ ; .\\ ] ] from the orthonormality of different quantum states we know that this integral must be proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "since in the bargmann representation we are only concerned with the _ functional _ relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and not the actual values , we can choose @xmath66 to be real . to stress this , we write @xmath126 .",
    "the orthogonality relation is thus derived from @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the real version of @xmath123 .",
    "following klauderer @xcite we find that @xmath129 h_{\\vec{m}}^b   ( \\vec{x})\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the differential operator @xmath131 acting solely on the exponential function .",
    "we now integrate the right - hand side by parts , yielding @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "the left - hand term is equal to zero when @xmath134 is positive definite , i.e. , when @xmath135 for all non - zero @xmath136 .",
    "repeating this procedure @xmath18 times yields @xmath137 when there is at least one @xmath138 , differentiating the mdhp @xmath18 times to @xmath139 will yield zero .",
    "thus we have @xmath140 when @xmath134 is positive definite and @xmath141 for any @xmath19 . the case where @xmath57 equals @xmath142",
    "is given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 denotes the product of @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "here , @xmath147 is equal to @xmath148 for the proof of this identity we refer to ref .  @xcite .",
    "so far , we only considered the use of ideal photo - detection . that is , we assumed that the detectors tell us exactly and with unit efficiency how many photons were present in the detected mode .",
    "however , in reality such detectors do not exist .",
    "in particular we have to incorporate losses ( non - perfect efficiency ) and dark counts .",
    "furthermore , we have to take into account the fact that most detectors do not have a single - photon resolution ( i.e. , they can not distinguish a single photon from two photons ) @xcite .",
    "this model is not suitable when we want to include dark counts .",
    "these unwanted light sources provide thermal light , which is not of the form of eq .",
    "( [ in2 ] ) . in single - shot experiments , however , dark counts can be neglected when the detectors operate only within a narrow time interval .",
    "we can model the efficiency of a detector by placing a beam splitter with transmission amplitude @xmath149 in front of a perfect detector @xcite .",
    "the part of the signal which is reflected by the beam - splitter ( and which will therefore never reach the detector ) is the loss due to the imperfect detector .",
    "since beam splitters are part of the set of optical devices we allow , we can make this generalisation without any problem .",
    "we now trace out all the reflected modes ( they are truly ` lost ' ) , and end up with a mixture in the remaining undetected modes .",
    "next , we can model the lack of single - photon resolution by using the relative probabilities @xmath150 and @xmath151 of the actual number @xmath109 or @xmath152 of detected photons conditioned on the indication of @xmath153 photons in the detector ( as described in ref .",
    "we can determine the pure states according to @xmath109 and @xmath152 detected photons , and add them with relative weights @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "this method is trivially generalised for more than two possible detected photon numbers .",
    "finally , we should note that our description of this class of optical circuits ( in terms of multi - dimensional hermite polynomials ) is essentially a one - way function .",
    "given a certain setup , it is relatively straightforward to determine the outgoing state of the circuit .",
    "the other way around , however , is very difficult . as exemplified by our efforts in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is almost impossible to obtain the matrix @xmath154 associated with an optical circuit which produces a particular predetermined state from a gaussian source .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the general form of squeezed multi - mode vacuum states conditioned on photo - detection of some of the modes .",
    "to lowest order , the outgoing states in the bargmann representation are proportional to multi - dimensional hermite polynomials . as an example",
    ", we showed how teleportation can be described this way .",
