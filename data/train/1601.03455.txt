    "such civilizations would be immersed in stellar environments so dense that distances between stars could be as small as hundreds or thousands of au : thousands to hundreds of times smaller than typical interstellar distances in the milky way s disk , which is home to the sun .",
    "interstellar communication between neighboring stars could take as little as weeks to months , and only decades from the center of the cluster to its edges . at a time when astronomical tools and techniques are as developed as those we now have on earth",
    ", most of the planets within the cluster would have been discovered , and the large numbers of photons incident from cluster stars would allow many detailed studies of exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "civilizations which reach a level of technical development comparable to our own at present , will therefore know a good deal about the nearest @xmath0 stars and an even larger number of s. they will be able to send exploratory probes to nearby stars and receive data that takes only days , weeks , or months to reach them",

    "the reason for this criterion is to allow for short interstellar communication and travel times . here",
    "we will focus on situations in which nearest - neighbor distances are smaller than @xmath5  au (  3.5 ) .",
    "we refer to regions satisfying both of these conditions as `` sweet spots '' .",
    "we conclude  3 by connecting these considerations to the existence and likely locations of s , which may dominate the number density in s.    in  4 we turn to the issue of what the  means for the long - term survivability of any s that develop within s. to do this we use the drake equation to compare conditions within s with those in the galactic disk .",
    "section  5 is devoted to an overview , a general discussion of the implications of the   for future searches for planets and for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations , and to the identification of s that may be ideal places to search .",
    "galactic s are old and their stars tend to have low  @xcite .",
    "because  formation requires metals , it could have been the case that s did not form in s. indeed , a null result was derived by a search for s in the  47  tuc .",
    "@xcite studied @xmath6 main - sequence stars in 47  tuc to discover and measure the frequency of  hot jupiters \" , gas giant planets in close orbits with their stars .",
    "if the frequency of hot jupiters in the observed portion of 47  tuc , near its center , is the same as in the solar neighborhood ( about @xmath7 ) , then this set of observations should have detected @xmath8 planets with radii @xmath9 and typical orbital periods of 3.5 days .",
    "no planet was detected .",
    "this suggests that jupiter - like s in close orbits are ten times less common in the center of 47 tuc .",
    "this however does not place limits on jovian planets in wider orbits or on planets with radii substantially smaller than jupiter s .",
    "two different effects could have been responsible for this dearth of hot jupiters .",
    "first , because the central field is dense , stellar interactions may have eliminated hot - jupiter systems .",
    "studies of the outer , less dense , regions of 47  tuc , also failed to discover hot jupiters @xcite , suggesting that dynamical interactions were not the culprits .",
    "this was validated by dynamical simulations that found that , had there been hot jupiters in the fields observed by gilliland et al . , they would have survived @xcite .",
    "the second effect is metalicity .",
    "an analysis of a sample of about @xmath10 exoplanets found that the frequency of hot jupiters declines with declining .",
    "of particular interest to this investigation are planets in the s of low - mass stars , because the majority of  stars are m dwarfs . through a detailed study of the _ kepler _ data , taking into account detectability and selection effects , @xcite estimate that as many as one in four m - dwarf habitable zones hosts an earth - sized planet , i.e. , a planet of radius @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , approximately one in 5 m - dwarf habitable zones hosts a super - earth ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "because the frequency of low - mass s does not follow the metallicity correlation found for hot jupiters @xcite , the same statistics may apply to s.    thus , studies of metalicity effects in the field indicate that s can form in s , and in the s of their host stars .",
    "it is worth noting that the range of host - star  has significant overlap with the range of  measured for s. of 1709 s listed in exoplanets.eu as of 6 december 2015 , 927 have @xmath13 , and 278 have @xmath14 . of 134",

    "more than half of these higher-@xmath15 systems have  larger than -0.5 , and one is positive .",
    "furthermore , some s exhibit multiple stellar populations , each apparently corresponding to a slightly different formation time , with stars formed at later times having higher metalicities @xcite .    because of the high ambient stellar densities ,  s are more likely to be ejected from their ps .",
    "s or else captured into the planetary systems of other stars . nevertheless , meibom et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reported the discovery of planets smaller than neptune in the old ( @xmath16  gyr ) open cluster ngc6811 .",
    "this example , and other recent planet discoveries in open clusters , show that s can form and planetary orbits can survive in dense environments , in spite of truncated protoplanetary disks found in some clustered environments and the relative fragility of some ps .",
    "s in these environments @xcite .",
    "in addition , not all orbital separations are equally dangerous .",
    "we will show in  3 that s contain large `` sweet spots '' , where planets in the habitable zones of low - mass stars can survive for many hubble times .    because s present crowded fields of dim stars , traditional methods to search for planets",
    "do nt yet do as well within s as in the field .",
    "s do have one advantage , however , which is that the high interaction rates produce low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that then morph into s.    the precise timing of the pulses allows planets to be discovered through studies of the residuals .",
    "the  m4 contains psr b1620 - 26 , with a spin period of 11 ms ( and mass @xmath17 ) .",
    "the pulsar is part of a triple system with a planetary mass object of @xmath18 orbiting a neutron star - white dwarf binary system @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf companion of the inner binary containing the neutron star has a mass of @xmath19 in a low eccentricity @xmath20 orbit .",
    "it is a young white dwarf , of age @xmath21 . from pulsar timing",
    "limits the planet has a 45 yr orbit with eccentricity ( @xmath22 ) with a semi - major axis of @xmath23 .",
    "the probability that a  will interact with a particular  star is very low and is not significantly increased by the presence of a planet .",
    "the discovery of this one planet must therefore signal the existence of a large population of planets in m4 .",
    "this planet therefore demonstrates that s may be common , even in a  with @xmath24 , and even in a  with an interaction probability high enough to produce a millisecond pulsar .",
    "a star s habitable zone is defined to be the region around it within which planets like earth can sustain water in liquid form on their surfaces . [ for low - mass stars see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "although the planet s atmosphere also plays a role in setting the surface temperature , a convenient and reasonable approximation to the radius , @xmath25 , of a habitable - zone orbit is : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the luminosity of the star . for each star",
    ", there is a range of orbits in the , and we will use this expression as a guideline .",
    "because the luminosities of stars decline steeply with decreasing mass , the habitable zones of low - mass stars can have radii considerably smaller than an au .",
    "small orbits are more stable with respect to stellar interactions , so that habitable - zone planets can have orbits that are stable over long time intervals . simulations of interactions between planetary systems and passing stars have been done by several groups .",
    "their work provides estimates of the value of @xmath28 we have found it convenient to use an expression taken from @xcite : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass density and @xmath31 the ambient speed .",
    "this expression is well suited for evaluation in a simple cluster model and is in approximate agreement with simulations by @xcite .",
    "more work is needed to incorporate the full range of effects that play roles in determining lifetimes .",
    "these effects include interactions between ps .",
    "s with multiple s and with stellar systems that may be binaries or higher order multiples . below",
    "we give a simple derivation showing that the uncertainty can be incorporated into a factor that is likely to change by less than an order of magnitude .",
    "consider a planetary system in which the stellar mass is @xmath32 and the planet is in a circular orbit with radius @xmath25 .",
    "the rate @xmath33 at which stars pass within a distance @xmath34 of this is dominated by gravitational focusing : @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the local average relative speed and @xmath36 is the local number density .",
    "the combined mass of the two stars passing each other is @xmath37 .    in order for a passage to significantly alter the orbit of the planet , leading for example to an ejection , exchange , or merger",
    ", the impact parameter @xmath34 must be comparable to @xmath25 : @xmath38 where typically @xmath39 the time between such close approaches gives an estimate of the orbital lifetime , which is a function of @xmath25 : @xmath40 @xmath41 the second line expresses @xmath42 in terms of @xmath25 .",
    "the wider the orbit , the shorter its lifetime . in this expression and the one",
    "just below , the number density is scaled to a high value . the density in most portions of globular clusters",
    "is not this high , leading to longer planetary - orbit lifetimes . for each cluster ,",
    "the density decreases as the distance from the center increases , making the lifetimes longer in the outer portions of the cluster .",
    "our focus is on planets in the s of their stars . on the third line of eq .  1 we utilize the mass - luminosity relationship for the lowest mass stars [ @xmath43 .",
    "the lifetime of planetary systems is longest for planets orbiting the least massive stars .",
    "interestingy , these stars also have very long lifetimes . hence there is a kind of serendipity : the stars which can provide the most stable environments for life and evolution , can also harbor s in s that are relatively safe .      what we are seeking is a kind of `` sweet spot '' in the cluster , where habitable - zone orbits are stable , but the density of stars is still large enough that interstellar travel can take less time .",
    "these two requirements are at odds with each other , since @xmath44 with large @xmath42 preferred , and @xmath45 , with small @xmath46 preferred .",
    "we expect the sweet spot to be a spherical shell that starts at some distance @xmath47 from the cluster center and ends at a larger radius @xmath48 .",
    "we will see that clusters which have low central densities and which are not highly concentrated will have sweet spots that start near the cluster center ( small @xmath47 ) , because survival times may be long even there . but in such clusters , the fall off of density with distance from the center will mean that interstellar distances become large for stars far from the center , so that the value of @xmath48 could be significantly smaller than the cluster s radius . for clusters that are more concentrated ,",
    "the sweet spot starts at larger distances from the center and may continue almost to the cluster s outer edge .",
    "thus , increasing concentration tends to move the sweet spot out .",
    "the concept of a sweet spot , is similar to the concept of a stellar habitable zone , or to a ghz these concepts are useful in identifying regions that are most likely to harbor life .",
    "but their boundaries are not sharp , and there is some arbitrariness in how we choose to define them . in the graphs illustrating the results derived below , we have selected the sweet spots to begin at that distance from the cluster center where the survival time of a habitable - zone planet is equal to the age of present - day earth , and to end at a place where average nearest - neighbor distances become larger than @xmath5  au . after illustrating results for these choices in sections 3.3 and 3.4 ,",
    "we return to the general case in  3.5 .    in s , light from other stars can provide a significant amount of energy .",
    "the ambient stellar flux is therefore of interest when considering the opportunities available to advanced civilizations in s. this is the total flux provided by the combination of all cluster stars .",
    "we also want to know the flux provided by the brightest nearby star .",
    "the average incident flux and the maximum received from a single star both are largest in regions where @xmath46 is small .",
    "that is , in regions where the distance between nearest neighbors is smallest , planets may also be able to draw energy from stars they do not orbit .",
    "this is also true for s , where energy drawn from nearby stars could help to fuel any life they may harbor .      to conduct a quantitative search for the sweet spot , we modeled both the cluster and its stellar population .",
    "we used plummer models for the cluster , because they are simply characterized by a total cluster mass @xmath49 and by a characteristic radius , @xmath50 .",
    "they allow us to derive analytic expressions for the mass interior to each radius , and the average local speed , @xmath51 as a function of radius . to model the stellar population , we proceeded as follows .",
    "we selected the initial stellar population from a miller - scalo initial - mass function ( imf ) @xcite , considering all stars with masses above @xmath52 .",
    "we took the mass of the present - day turn off to be @xmath53 ; stars with slightly higher mass ( up to @xmath54 ) , were considered to be giants . any star with an initially higher mass",
    "was considered to be a present - day stellar remnant : we included @xmath55 white dwarfs , @xmath56 neutron stars , and @xmath57 black holes ] derived from stars with initial masses of @xmath58 $ ] , respectively .",
    "this produces a population in which @xmath59 of the stars are main - sequence dwarf stars , @xmath60 of the stars are white dwarfs , 0.2% are giants , and the remaining stars are primarily neutron stars .",
    "the sizes of globular - cluster populations of neutron stars and black holes is difficult to predict , and only a small fraction of these compact objects can be discovered through their actions as x - ray binaries or recycled pulsars .",
    "compact objects make negligible contributions to the average flux , and their presence does nt alter the average distances between stars .",
    "there are exceptions , when a compact object accretes matter from a close companion , emitting x - rays .",
    "the brightest x - ray binaries in galactic s ( low - mass x - ray binaries , lmxbs ) typically have luminosities of @xmath61  erg  s@xmath62 .",
    "their influence on any life associated with other stars is likely to be limited because ( 1 )  the numbers of bright lmxbs are small , with @xmath63 known in the milky way s system of s @xcite ; ( 2 )  many have low duty cycles ; ( 3 )  only s relatively near to even a bright lmxb receive more light from it than from their host star .",
    "furthermore , lmxbs tend to be in or near the cluster core where survival of habitable - zone s would be challenging even in the absence of lmxbs , especially for the higher - mass stars that tend to be found there .",
    "the successors to lmxbs are recycled millisecond pulsars which can also be luminous .",
    "we will discuss them in  5 .",
    "we placed each star at a specific randomly chosen point within @xmath64 of the cluster center .",
    "we kept track of the total mass of stars that should be ( according to the plummer model ) within each shell of thickness @xmath65 and stopped adding stars to a shell when it reached the appropriate mass . in this way the total mass generated by each simulation matched the total mass we had selected for the plummer model , and",
    "the mass profile matched the analytically - derived cluster profile .",
    "we generated the luminosity of each star as follows .",
    "for main - sequence stars with masses below @xmath66 we set @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the luminosity of the star and @xmath69 is its mass . for main - sequence stars of higher mass",
    ", we used @xmath70 .",
    "giants ( compact objects ) were arbitrarily assigned @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .    with each star assigned a position and luminosity , we computed the flux as a function of @xmath73 by choosing a random point in each of @xmath74 spherical shells , centered on the cluster , with radii extending to @xmath75 at each randomly - selected point we computed the total flux provided by all of the cluster stars , as well as the flux of the star that contributed the most to the total flux reaching that point .",
    "we also computed the distance from each randomly selected point to the nearest star .",
    "the results are shown in figures  1 and 2 , where we have computed moving averages for @xmath76 and @xmath77      we conducted a full set of calculations for two different cluster masses ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "for each mass , we used three separate values of @xmath80  pc , @xmath81  pc , and @xmath82  pc .",
    "figures 1 and 2 each show results of calculations for a  with mass @xmath83 they illustrate the trends we sought to explore . in figure  1 ( figure  2 )",
    "@xmath84  pc ( @xmath85  pc ) , corresponding to low ( high ) concentrations . in the upper panel of each figure ,",
    "the the logarithm to the base ten of the survival time is plotted versus the logarithm to the base ten of @xmath86 the upper ( lower ) curve corresponds to orbits in the  of a main - sequence star of mass @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) values of @xmath42 scale by a factor equal to the inverse square - root of the ratio of the masses . ] . a horizontal line at @xmath89 is plotted to correspond to a survival time roughly equal to the present - day age of the earth .",
    "the globular cluster considered in figure 1 has such a low concentration that s in the s of stars with masses below roughly @xmath90 can survive throughout the cluster , even near the center .",
    "this is indicated by the red vertical line near @xmath91 , and the red arrow pointing toward larger values of @xmath73 . the blue vertical line and",
    "it s associated arrow indicate that survival near the center and throughout the cluster is also possible for planets in the habitable zones of @xmath92 white dwarfs @xcite . for s in the s of dwarf stars with masses of @xmath88",
    ", however , survival is possible only at somewhat larger values of @xmath73 , as indicated by the orange line with the rightward pointing arrow .    in low - concentration clusters ,",
    "the stellar density near the cluster s outer edge can be comparable to the stellar density in the vicinity of our sun .",
    "the globular cluster opportunity is therefore lost at large values of @xmath73 . in the middle panel , we have drawn a horizontal line corresponding to interstellar nearest - neighbor distances of @xmath5  au . if we rather arbitrarily posit that , for interstellar distances larger than this , the  is lost , then the `` sweet spot '' ends at the value of @xmath93 shown with an orange line and leftward pointing arrow in the middle panel of figure  2 .",
    "this example illustrates that for , globular clusters with low central concentrations , the globular cluster sweet spot is a large spherical shell .",
    "figure 2 shows the results for a globular cluster with a higher central concentration . in this case ,",
    "survival of habitable - zone planets is possible only for larger values of @xmath73 than when the stellar concentration is low . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar density remains high even as one approaches the cluster s edge .",
    "thus , the overall effect is that the sweet spot moves outward as the stellar concentration increases .",
    "note that the edge of the sweet spot occurs at higher values of @xmath73 than those shown here .",
    "real globular clusters exhibit a phenomenon known as mass segregation , in which more massive stars tend to be over - represented in the cluster s central regions , while low - mass stars are over - represented in the outer regions .",
    "this effect could tend to place g dwarfs near the cluster center , where planets in their habitable zones are able to survive for only short times .",
    "mass segregation may also place dwarf stars of the lowest masses near the outer edges of clusters .",
    "thus , many low - mass stars and s in low - concentration clusters may inhabit portions of the clusters where interstellar distances are large . to explore this effect we conducted simulations that modeled mass segregation . because the factors that determine the distribution of masses within s are complex and dynamical in nature ,",
    "we have employed a toy model , described below , which shows the general effect of mass segregation .    at each value of @xmath73",
    "we chose some of the stars from the miller - scalo imf , and some from a uniform distribution . to mimic mass segregation",
    ", we favored the uniform distribution near the center of the cluster , and the miller - scalo imf toward the outer edges .",
    "specifically , when our simulated location was a distance @xmath73 from the cluster center , we generated a random number ; if its value was smaller than than @xmath94 $ ] , we chose from a uniform distribution , otherwise we chose from the miller - scalo distribution .",
    "for the more condensed cluster , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) of stars of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) occupy the `` sweet spot '' for stars of that mass .",
    "thus , the `` sweet spots '' not only exist , but are occupied . for the less condensed cluster ,",
    "the effects of mass segregation were small on the low-@xmath73 side of the sweet spot , but the cut off at large @xmath73 meant that only roughly @xmath97 of g dwarfs , and @xmath98 of m and k dwarfs are in the `` sweet spot '' at any given time .",
    "it is therefore important to note that stars move throughout the cluster .",
    "thus , because low - concentration gives habitable - zone orbits very long lifetimes , most stars will spend a significant amount of time passing through the `` sweet spot '' , where stellar densities are high enough to decrease interstellar travel times significantly .",
    "individual stars have habitable zones : regions in which it is neither too hot nor too cold to allow liquid water to exist on the surface of an earth - like .",
    "the locations of  boundaries are not fixed numbers .",
    "this is not only because life may exist under a wider range of conditions than we know , but more specifically because several properties of stars , s and ary orbits play roles in determining habitability . in the previous two sections , we have explored whether the orbits of habitable - zone s can survive in a dense  environment . if the ambient stellar density is too high , passing stars are likely to steal , destroy , or eject the s that had been in the  over time intervals too short for life to develop .",
    "the radius at which the stellar density drops to the point that a  in the  of a star of mass @xmath69 can survive , marks the beginning of what can be called the _",
    "( gc - hz ) _ for stars of that mass .",
    "the gc - hz extends from that point outward to the edge of the cluster .",
    "the characteristics of the gc - hz are the following .    the location of the inner edge of the gc - hz ( i.e. , the inner edge of the sweet spot )    ( 1 )  depends on the survival time considered .",
    "( 2 )  has a strong dependence on stellar mass , because the stellar  is smaller for low - mass stars and interactions are less likely to disrupt small orbits .",
    "( 3 )  depends on the orbit of the star within the cluster .",
    "stars within a  can travel from its central to its outer regions . whether a specific planetary orbit survives depends on how much time the ps",
    ".  spends at different distances , @xmath73 , from the center of the .",
    "the sweet spot incorporates a new concept , which is that the distances between stars can play a role in the long - term survivability of an advanced civilization .",
    "large interstellar distances , such as those common in the solar neighborhood , imply long two - way communication and interstellar travel times .",
    "it seems likely that , if interstellar distances are smaller by more than an order of magnitude , the time needed to establish independent outposts would also be shorter .",
    "the factor by which times need to be shorter is , at present , a matter of conjecture .",
    "if disk civilizations live long enough on average to establish outposts , then the factor may simply be unity .",
    "here we have assumed that a decrease in travel time ( hence in @xmath46 ) by a factor of @xmath3 , provides any s in s with a stronger opportunity to establish outposts . a limit on the value of @xmath46 ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor distance , determines the location of the outer edge of the sweet spot .",
    "the value of @xmath46 , the nearest - neighbor distance , in s versus its value in the galactic disk allows us to relate the travel times required in these two environments .",
    "the nearest habitable  in both cases may well be associated with another , more distant neighbor .",
    "in fact , it may be the case , in both the solar neighborhood and in s , that the density of ps .",
    "s in which members of a particular  could find or make suitable habitats is significantly smaller than the overall stellar density .",
    "as long as the relative density of suitable habitats is either the same or larger in s , then the travel times to these suitable habitats would still be shorter than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "interactions involving ps .",
    "s can have a range of outcomes .",
    "some s are exchanged into other ps .",
    "s or else ejected as a result of interactions . wide - orbit planets are more likely to be lost through interactions with passing stars .",
    "furthermore , when their release velocities are comparable to their previous orbital velocities , the speeds are not generally large enough to allow escape from the cluster .",
    "thus , s around stars are constantly being stripped away and joining the ranks of s , many of which remain bound to the cluster .",
    "s may be found in every part of the cluster , but many will be ejected from regions near the center of the . as they move away , they will receive a large but decreasing amount of energy from the star that had been their host .",
    "the bottom panels of figures 1 and 2 show that they will also continue to receive significant flux from the other cluster stars",
    ". this flux will be most significant in high - concentration clusters .",
    "interestingly enough , in many cases , the dominant source of ambient light will be a single star not previously related to the .    if s are to house life , they must have outer layers that shield the life from fluxes of comets and asteroids , from high - energy particles , and from some portions of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "[ see , e.g. , @xcite . ] in our own solar system , some moons of the outer planets are covered by ice that can serve as a shield for oceans @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since life requires energy , any life on free - floating planets must have sources of energy independent of irradiation by a single star .",
    "we are now coming to understand that there are myriad sources of energy on which moons of the outer solar system can draw , ranging radioactivity to tidal interactions .",
    "some of these could also be available to s in s. free - floating planets in globular clusters may be able to draw upon energy emitted by nearby stars .",
    "it is for this reason that we have included the lower panels of figures 1 and 2 , which depict the average flux received as a function of distance from the cluster s center , as well as the flux received from the brightest nearby star .",
    "we have no information at present about s in s , but studies of both s @xcite and microlensing events @xcite provide evidence for them in the disk .    free - floating s must be considered as possible habitats for life and for s. s also interact with ps .",
    "s. the expression for the rate of interactions is the same as the rate for interactions with stars (  3.1 ) . the distances of closest approach associated with dramatic effects however , tend to be smaller , yielding a smaller value for the rate of interactions per free - floating planet . to compute the total numbers of interactions with s , we need to know their density .",
    "if their numbers are larger than the number of stars , the density may also be larger .",
    "however , mass segregation is an important feature of globular clusters , and free - floating planets have masses much smaller than those of the cluster stars .",
    "we therefore expect that , even though the cluster s core may be the point of origin of many free - floating planets , they may spend the large majority of their time in the outer portions of the globular cluster .",
    "this means that , in spite of the large numbers of free - floating planets , their local spatial densities may tend to be low .    that any life on s may need shielding by an outer layer at all times ,",

    "searches for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) started in the 1950s and 1960s @xcite , and references in , before planets beyond the solar system had been discovered .",
    "today we know of more than 2000 exoplanets ( see , e.g. , _",
    "exoplanets.edu_ ) but there are many open questions about planets , the formation of life , the nature of intelligence , and the development and lifetime of advanced civilizations .",
    "let @xmath106 represent the lifetime of an advanced civilization .",
    "our premise is that , once a  civilization is able to set up independent outposts , the probability becomes smaller that a catastrophic event will eliminate all s descended from it .",
    "we also postulate that smaller interstellar distances decrease the time @xmath107 it takes for a civilization to establish outposts .",
    "these ideas incorporate several assumptions .",
    "first , interstellar travel must be possible in globular clusters .",
    "for example , the danger of impacts from small masses in interstellar space must not be too great .",
    "second , it must be possible to establish outposts .",
    "if , for example , life is plentiful , but incompatible in different planetary systems , it may be difficult to find hospitable environments .",
    "if both interstellar travel and the establishment of outposts can occur , it is reasonable to consider that smaller interstellar distances could allow the first self - sustaining outpost to be established by a globular - cluster civilization at a time @xmath108      the drake equation , developed during the early years of seti , identifies the factors that determine the number of communicating civilizations in existence in the galaxy at a typical time .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "there are many possible definitions of the term  communicating civilization \" . to set a scale , we will classify earth as a planet with a communicating civilization , with a lifetime @xmath27 , so far , of 100 years .",
    "the form most suitable for our purposes is the following , where @xmath109 is the number of s on planets bound to stars .",
    "@xmath111 is the total number of stars in the disk .",
    "@xmath112 is the fraction of stars with planets , and @xmath113 is the average number of planets per star .",
    "the fraction of planets on which life develops and the fraction of these on which intelligent life develops , and the fraction of these on which s develop are , respectively , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these factors are combined to form the overall factor @xmath117 the average number of s formed per star .",
    "the number of s orbiting stars at any given time is proportional to @xmath118 the average lifetime of those communicating civilizations orbiting stars .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 is the fraction of a hubble time over which there is a communicating civilization .",
    "* numbers of stars : * the first element of our comparison is the ratio @xmath120 , where the numerator is the number of stars in a .",
    "this varies among s from under @xmath121 to more than @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath122    if all other factors were equal , a population of a few times @xmath123 communicating civilizations in the disk would correspond to @xmath16 in the galaxy s population of @xmath2 globular clusters .",
    "a disk population roughly 100 times as large would correspond to @xmath16  within each of many s.    * value of @xmath124 : * the second element of our comparison is the factor @xmath124 , the number of s formed per star . the fact that  stars are long - lived means that a large fraction of them provide environments stable enough for life to form and evolve on their planets .",
    "in fact , old planetary systems may have had several opportunities to produce civilizations during the past 12  gyr . while the same is true for old stars in the disk , only a smaller fraction of them are as old as globular cluster stars .",
    "in addition , evolution on  s is less likely to be subject to interruptions .",
    "for example , astronomical events and excess exposure to radiation and winds can essentially `` reset '' the clock for evolving life and civilizations .",
    "these `` resets '' can delay evolution toward advanced civilizations , or destroy them .",
    "because s have little gas and dust , they do not form stars or produce core - collapse supernovae or long gamma - ray bursts .    of course",
    ", stellar passages have the effect of interrupting developments on those planets that are either ejected because of an interaction , or else come to orbit another star after an interaction .",
    "we have shown , however , that large numbers of s in the s of low - mass stars should be stable throughout significant portions of most s. from the perspective of developing and evolving life in a manner that may parallel what happened on earth , these are the most important systems , and this is why @xmath124 may have values in s similar to those in the disk .",
    "it is also important to consider , however , that orbits of many planets are disrupted through interactions .",
    "ejection is especially likely for s in wider orbits , where liquid water could not have been be sustained .",
    "ejections transform these s into free floaters .",
    "life that had existed on a planet losing its star , could expire and/or develop differently afterward .",
    "finally , changes in orbit can be induced by stellar passages , even when a ary system s architecture is not reconfigured .",
    "these effects , though more modest , could nevertheless influence life in a ps .",
    "( in either a positive or negative way ) , and must be considered in more detailed work , similar to the way issues such as orbital eccentricity are now considered in computations involving the habitable zone .",
    "the enhanced stability of the  environment is part of what we can call the _ globular cluster opportunity_.    * lifetimes of s : * the final factor is the lifetime of s. let @xmath125 be the number of ps .",

    "4 is over planetary systems , the inner summation is over the sequence of civilizations in a given ps . .",
    "the first term represents communicating civilizations that do not establish outposts .",
    "the second term represents communicating civilizations that do establish outposts .",
    "once a set of independent , self - sustaining outposts has been established , the cluster may always host descendants of the original `` seed '' civilization .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath27 is simply the difference between the present time and the start of the seed civilization .",
    "we include the factor @xmath127 to recognize that effects we can not anticipate may lead to the end of these civilizations in spite of the apparent opportunity to continue into the indefinite future .",
    "the second part of the _ globular cluster opportunity _ is that relatively small interstellar distances may allow self - sustaining outposts to be developed over relatively short time scales .",
    "this would give s the potential to host s over a continuous very - long - lasting epoch .",
    "our discussion of the drake equation has focused on the numbers of communicating civilization expected at present .",
    "it is useful to also consider the total number @xmath128 of civilizations that are ever formed within a stellar population ( either a galaxy or a ) .",
    "@xmath129 let s suppose that , over the course of a hubble time , a certain minimum number , @xmath130 , of s must arise within a specific  in order to ensure that one of them will be able to establish self - sustaining outposts . in order for this minimum value to be achieved , the value of @xmath131 must be greater than @xmath132    @xmath133    this equality translates a minimum value of @xmath128 into a minimum value of @xmath134 , which can then be related , through equation  2 into a condition on the factors whose product is @xmath135 .",
    "for example , one way to achieve a value @xmath136 is if only @xmath137 of cluster stars have s that can support life , only @xmath7 of s with life support intelligent life , and @xmath7 of planets with intelligent life produce s. these relatively low probabilities could be enough to ensure that every  hosts a long - lived , even if only one in ten  s succeeds in establishing outposts .    to place these values in context",
    ", we consider the galactic disk",
    ". should @xmath138 be as small as @xmath139 , then @xmath140 disk stars would produce @xmath1 s in a hubble time .",
    "if these each last for a time @xmath141  years , with @xmath142 ranging from 1 to 7 , there would be @xmath143 s at any one time . in the small-@xmath142 limit , we could be the only  active in the galaxy today .",
    "in the large-@xmath142 limit , the nearest  would be on the order of @xmath144  pc away .",
    "this example illustrates that many of the milky way s s could presently host advanced s that have spread throughout the cluster , whether the disk of the galaxy contains no other s or whether it is rich in s. furthermore , if s do host s , they will tend to be old civilizations .",
    "the drake equation can be applied to s. let @xmath145 be the number of s on s. @xmath146 @xmath147 is the total number of s in the disk .",
    "the fraction of s on which life develops and the fraction of these on which intelligent life develops , and the fraction of these on which s develop are , respectively , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "these factors are combined to form the overall factor @xmath151 the number of s formed per .",
    "@xmath152 is the average lifetime of those communicating civilizations on s.    we do nt know the number of s. based on microlensing surveys , the disk population of s appears to be larger than the disk population of main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath147 to @xmath153 the value of @xmath154 needed to produce a certain number of s is proportional to @xmath155 .",
    "thus , large values of @xmath156 mean that the value of @xmath154 can be even smaller than @xmath124 , to produce a number of s on s comparable to the number of s on s bound to stars",
    ". put another way , the chance of a  developing on an  can be very small , making life extremely uncommon among s ; yet there may be more s developing on s than on s in the s of stars .",
    "s in s have an advantage , in that the stars in their vicinity may provide significant energy .",
    "this is especially so if the civilization is advanced enough to build and transport large stellar - light collectors .",
    "although only a single  has so far been discovered in a , several lines of reasoning suggest that globular - cluster planets may be common . if there is a similarity to ps .",
    "s in the disk , then low - mass cluster stars may host s in their s. we have shown that there are large regions of s , `` sweet spots '' , in which ( 1 )  habitable - zone ary orbits have long lifetimes , while ( 2 )  the distances between neighboring stars are small enough to significantly decrease interstellar travel times from what they are in the galactic disk .    the existence of a `` sweet spot '' , possibly combined with long - term stability afforded by the lack of massive stars in s , is what we have referred to as the .",
    "if life and s develop on the habitable - zone planets , then it is reasonable to consider the possibility that the lifetime of some  civilizations may exceed the time needed to establish independent outposts .",
    "should this be the case , then s may host s that are old and are spread throughout the cluster .",
    "we aim to identify those s most likely to have large sweet spots .",
    "if the primary criterion we needed to impose were the existence of s in the s of cluster stars , this would favor low stellar densities .",
    "we want , however , to also have relatively small distances between neighboring stars , which favors high densities .",
    "we consider an analogy with lmxbs , and their progeny , recycled millisecond pulsars .",
    "the formation of lmxbs has been explained in terms of interactions made possible by a high - density environment @xcite . as a result of these interactions ,",
    "a neutron star comes to have a binary companion that will donate mass to it .",
    "the interaction which led to the formation of this binary is likely to have involved one or more binaries in the initial state .",
    "furthermore , before post - interaction mass transfer can start , the newly formed neutron star binary must generally survive for a significant length of time before the donor comes to fill its roche lobe .",
    "these circumstances suggest that the cluster must include , not far from the core , regions of modest density .",
    "in fact , the orbit of the planet in m4 has a large semimajor axis ( @xmath157  au ) , which would not survive in the cluster core .",
    "this balance of higher and lower density is similar to the qualities we seek in a  that has a significant sweet spot .",
    "these points are demonstrated empirically in figure  3 , each of whose points corresponds to a  whose parameters have been taken from the harris ( 2010 ) catalog . along the horizontal axis is the log of the central luminosity density , @xmath158 along the vertical axis is the logarithm to the base 10 of the _ half - mass concentration factor _ , which we have defined to be @xmath159 .",
    "we used this factor because the value of @xmath160 ( from the plummer model ) is directly tied to the overall fall - off of the cluster density with distance from the center .    in figure  3",
    ", points with a yellow triangle superposed correspond to s that host s. those surrounded by green rings contain at least @xmath161 s and those surrounded by red rings have @xmath3 or more s. the figure displays two trends .",
    "first , there are no discovered s in s with @xmath162 .",
    "second , neither very high nor very low concentration factors are associated with multiple s. while the trends in figure  3 almost certainly reflect observational selection effects convolved with physical principles ( for example , each cluster may host more s than observed ) , they are consistent with the results of  3 for habitable - zone s illustrated in figures  1 and 2 . in table  1",
    "we therefore use the numbers of s as a proxy to help prioritize searches for planets and for intelligent life in s , keeping in mind that other factors may eventually be understood to be more important .",
    "the columns are the : cluster name ; distance from us ; metalicity ; concentration factor computed from the the ratio of the core to tidal radius ; core radius ; half - mass radius ; concentration factor , @xmath163 , as defined above ; central luminosity density ; and the number of known recycled pulsars .",
    "millisecond pulsars provide strong , stable , periodic signals , which in 19 of the s listed in table  1 , emanate from different directions .",
    "timing precision allows the determination of their positions with great accuracy and this precision has in turn led to suggestions of using pulsar timing to navigate spacecraft [ @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review ] .",
    "that is , measured timing residuals of multiple pulsars can be used to determine the spacecraft position with a precision that depends on the accuracy of the measured times of arrival of pulses ( toas ) and the stability of the pulsars .",
    "because pulsar observations using radio telescopes require large collecting area of the telescopes that are impractical for spacecrafts , x - ray observations of pulsars using much smaller x - ray telescopes have been proposed for spacecraft navigation @xcite ( see also @xcite and us patent 7197381b2 ) . with an ensemble of four millisecond pulsars and realistic timing accuracy @xcite",
    "show that the position of a spacecraft can be determined to an accuracy of 20 km on a trajectory from earth to mars . since in a globular cluster environment",
    "a set of pulsars will be within a typical distance @xmath164 pc , the pulsars appear far brighter than when viewed from the solar system , thousands of parsecs away .",
    "the potential use of small radio antennae could allow _ radio _ pulsar timing with the precision needed for navigation .",
    "the crowding of dim  stars , at distances larger than a kpc ( table 1 ) , makes it challenging to discover globular - cluster ps .",
    "s. the progress made during the past several years in discovering s in open clusters is , however , a positive development .",
    "transit studies of the outer regions of s would allow us to focus on s in the habitable zone while taking advantage of mass segregation .",
    "the most numerous stars would be very low - mass m dwarfs , and their small sizes would optimize the chances of discovering the small planets that are expected .",
    "high resolution studies like those conducted by @xcite with hst , could be effective in regions of higher density . in the core , however , mass segregation could mean that the most common main sequence stars are those of relatively high mass .",
    "orbital periods of s in the  could be dozens or hundreds of days .",
    "it would therefore be more productive to study dense regions located outside the core .",
    "even so , the baselines would need to be long enough for the discovery of planets in orbits that have periods up to a few tens of days .",
    "another important step would be to discover free floating planets .",
    "discoveries of free floating planets in the field have been reported by microlensing teams @xcite .",
    "microlensing is ideally suited for these discoveries , because gravitational lensing is sensitive to mass ; light from the planet is not required .",
    "as it happens , several globular clusters lie in fields studied by optical monitoring team .",
    "excess events along the directions to these clusters have been reported @xcite .",
    "the rate of lensing events due to globular cluster stars is expected to be small @xcite .",
    "but with the improved monitoring now being conducted , enough  lensing events will have been discovered that it should be possible to discover or place limits on free - floating planets in s. furthermore , knowing the distance and proper motion of the cluster would allow the mass of each planet so discovered to be measured .      in 1974",
    "a radio message was beamed from aricebo to the  m13 ( _ http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/arecibo-message_ ) .",
    "if that message is received and answered promptly , it will take almost 42,000 years for us to receive a response . although other s are closer , almost all are more than a kpc away , making short - term two - way communication problematic .    if , therefore , we are to find evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence in globular clusters , it will be through signals that originated in the clusters long ago .",
    "these signals may represent attempts at communication with s in the galactic disk . or they may be signals generated incidentally as a   society carries out its normal functions . with more than 50 years of work on this topic , many ideas have been developed .    if s are common in the galaxy , s may be good targets for seti , simply because they are dense , well - defined stellar systems . in ",
    "4 we showed that , even if s are rare in the disk of the milky way , they could occupy multiple galactic s , and could be very advanced .",
    "although discussions of long - lived s are necessarily speculative , it may be easier to detect signals from an advanced civilization .",
