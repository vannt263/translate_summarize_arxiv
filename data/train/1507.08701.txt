    "it is then natural to ask whether there are efficient frequency recovery algorithms that can further improve the performance or relax the frequency separation conditions when compared with the total variation minimization or atomic norm minimization .",

    "we remark that there are quite a few works in the literature@xcite where iterative reweighted methods have been used to improve sparse recovery performance in compressed sensing .",

    "we describe new algorithms to address this issue in the following section .",
    "we propose three iterative algorithms to enhance frequency recovery performance in the absence of external prior information . in our algorithms , we use estimated frequency support information from previous iterations as block prior for subsequent iterations .",

    "banm requires solving sdp in each iteration to estimate the location of frequencies , but solving sdp repeatedly causes long execution time .",
    "thus , we propose using low - complexity algorithm to obtain prior information on frequency locations .",
    "we then use the aforementioned sdp ( [ eq : blocksparsitysdp ] ) only in the last iteration for accurately determining the frequency locations .",
    "this concept is the key to design of our algorithm - block iterative reweighted @xmath4 and atomic norm minimization mixture ( or simply , banm - mix ) algorithm that can achieve super - resolution of frequencies with low complexity ( algorithm [ alg : biterl1 ] ) .",
    "banm - mix first discretizes the continuous frequency domain [ 0,1 ] in uniform intervals of size @xmath81 .",

    "we refer to our procedure in ( [ eq : updateweight ] ) as _ block reweighting_. since the discretized dictionary under consideration has highly correlated columns , block reweighting can accurately reflect the likelihood of a true frequency existing around @xmath113 .",
    "our numerical experiments showed that earlier reweighting strategies @xcite , which update @xmath114 , could not correctly reflect the likelihood of a true frequency being at index @xmath115 and resulted in worse frequency recovery performance .",
    "this is because the solution to ( [ eq : weightedl1 ] ) will disperse the amplitude of a true frequency into the neighboring indices in highly correlated dictionary columns .    after updating @xmath106 for @xmath92 ,",
    "banm - mix updates the index set @xmath116 through adaptive gridding . in adaptive gridding , banm - mix first finds indices @xmath115 , @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the minimum and maximum values of the elements of @xmath121 respectively .",

    "the reason is that when @xmath106 is small , very likely a true frequency exists around frequency @xmath126 . by applying finer gridding around frequency @xmath126",
    ", one can estimate the frequency location more accurately in the next iteration .",
    "we call this method of applying different resolutions in the discretized dictionary as _ adaptive gridding _ ( see fig . [",
    "fig : adaptive_grid ] ) .",
    "the algorithm continues solving ( [ eq : weightedl1 ] ) in each iteration until either a specified maximum number of iterations ( maxitr ) is exhausted or the solution of ( [ eq : weightedl1 ] ) converges i.e. , @xmath129 , for some error tolerance @xmath130 .",
    "banm - mix then chooses the block prior set @xmath43 by a union of the frequency blocks around frequency @xmath70 satisfying @xmath131 . with this frequency block information , we use sdp ( [ eq : blocksparsitysdp ] ) to super - resolve frequencies in the last iteration .",
    "the complexity of banm - mix can still be high since we have to solve an sdp in the last iteration . to further reduce its complexity , we propose the block iterative reweighted @xmath4 minimization ( bl1 m ) algorithm which is the same as banm - mix except that bl1 m does not solve sdp in the last iteration .",
