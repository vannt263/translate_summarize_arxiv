    "hot subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are considered to be he  core burning systems with masses usually near 0.5  m@xmath0 and thin hydrogen envelopes , located at the blue end of the horizontal branch .",
    "since they form a narrow sequence , they are also referred to as extended horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars .",
    "studies by maxted et al .",
    "@xcite indicated that nearly half of the apparently single sdb stars are in short period binaries with white dwarf ( wd ) or m dwarf companions .",
    "the possible formation channels include stable , conservative mass transfer through a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) or a dynamical  timescale mass transfer ( unstable ) leading to a common envelope ( ce ) evolution . maxted s binaries are products of ce evolution .",
    "the rlof channel can generate luminous main sequence ( ms ) companions at long periods , with sdb masses and luminosities lower than typical .",
    "how important is the rlof channel ?",
    "we used the binary stellar evolution ( bse ) code of hurley et al.@xcite , mapping sets of initial binaries into present  day binaries that include sdbs , and distinguishing `` observable '' sdbs from `` hidden '' ones .",
    "the common envelope efficiency parameter , @xmath1 was set to 1.5 .",
    "one million initial binaries were chosen at random using an initial mass function for @xmath2 , uniform distribution of mass ratio @xmath3 , and log  uniform distribution of initial separation .",
    "we define a star as an sdb in the bse code if it has surface gravity in the range @xmath4 ( cgs ) and effective temperature in the range @xmath5  k. systems that form sdb binaries with ms companions have initial values of @xmath6 between 0 and 5 m@xmath0 depending on @xmath2 .",
    "initial orbital periods for these systems are between 1 and 200 days .    the distribution of @xmath7 for the ms companions versus the orbital period after sdb formation shows two distinct sub  populations , reflecting the rlof channel ( long period , 2300 d ) and the ce channel ( short period , 0.33 d ) . similar work by han et al .",

    ") diagram illustrating the evolution of a binary system that forms an sdb star and an f0 companion . ]",
    "figure 1 shows the stellar evolutionary tracks for a binary system that forms an sdb star and a ms companion ; initial masses were 0.65 and 2.40 m@xmath0 , the initial orbital period was 2.20 days .",
    "the more massive star ( dashed line ) evolves off the ms first and fills its roche lobe to start a stable mass transfer onto its low mass ms companion , which becomes an f0 star . in the process",
    ", the first star loses its envelope to form a he  burning star , which we classify here as an sdb .",
    "crosses / plusses mark the parts of the tracks of both stars while the initially more massive star is in the sdb phase .",
    "this stage of sdb+f0 ms binary lasts for @xmath81.0 gyr , so such systems may be relatively numerous .",
    "the sdb stars exhausts he and becomes a co wd .",
    "the f0 star remains on the ms for another @xmath81.2 gyr .",
    "the system evolves further , after a ce episode , as a pair of low  mass wds ( co + he ) which coalesce at age 3.3 gyr , briefly making a he star , then a co wd .",
    "figure 2 presents brightness estimates at different wavelengths of the sdb star and its f0 companion from fig .  1 . the sdb star has lower than canonical mass ( 0.319 m@xmath0 ) , hence low luminosity and a long lifetime .",
    "the system has been placed at 1.0 kpc .",
    "vertical bars indicate the approximate effective wavelengths and useful magnitude ranges of galex ais , sdss , and 2mass . during the long sdb+f0 phase",
    ", the companion dominates the sdb in the optical , but not in the far uv .",
    "such systems typically would not be found in present catalogues of sdb stars . in the sdss",
    "ugriz bandpasses , the companion star would be saturated at 1.0 kpc . at d @xmath9 1.0",
    "kpc , where sdss is not saturated , either one must observe near the galactic plane ( where sdss and galex do not go and where reddening complicates the analysis ) or one must observe several scale heights above the disk . a more effective way to search for such systems is to select f ",
    "star candidates based on their near ",
    "ir ( 2mass ) colors , then search for a far  uv excess ( uvx ) using galex .",
    "a preliminary search for f+uvx systems near @xmath10 suggests that 1 or 2 f stars out of 100 may be hiding a hot subdwarf companion .",
    "we are observing a few of these at the hobby ",
    "eberly telescope , to see whether the f star s radial velocity is variable .",
    "the ultimate goal is to measure the ratio of sdb binaries formed by the rlof and ce channels in a fair sample , and to find the critical mass ratio that separates stable from unstable mass transfer .    supported by nasa nng05ge11 g and nsf phy 03 - 26281 , phy 06 - 00953 and phy 06 - 53462 .",
