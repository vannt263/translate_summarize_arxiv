    "since one can not study directly how a galaxy forms and evolves ( how the mass and luminosity of a galaxy change with time ) , it becomes necessary to analyse the statistics of a large number of galaxies at different epochs . using the swire ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2004 ) 24 m mips - band , one is able observe the fir emission from dust , tracing star - formation ( sf ) regions and sf - galaxies . by studying these galaxies at different epochs one can gain an estimate of the star formation history of the universe . as a follow up to swire , a spectroscopic redshift survey covering a 0.55 deg@xmath3 region , centred in the lockman validation field was undertaken .",
    "the sample was observed using the hydra spectrometer on the 4-m wiyn telescope at kpno and included 24 m sources down to a vega r - band magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "a total of 286 24 m sources were observed and redshifts for the resultant spectra were determined .",
    "redshifts for 170 sources with 24 m fluxes down to a flux limit of 260jy were determined , giving a spectroscopic completeness for the sample of 82.5% .",
    "in order to determine each object s 24 m luminosity ( l@xmath4 ) an appropriate sed and k - correction for that galaxy must be chosen .",
    "here 6 seds were chosen , 2 agn , 2 spiral and 2 starburst ( xu et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the fitting was performed using a minimum @xmath5 technique that incorporated an error weighting ( including a dispersion factor , previously unseen in the literature ) .",
    "this dispersion factor accounts for the scatter within a particular population of galaxies in colour - colour space .",
    "each sed was then convolved through the 24 m filter .",
    "the lf@xmath4 was estimated by implementing the 1/vmax estimator technique ( schmidt 1968 ) and took into account both the r - band and 24 m flux limits .",
    "a redshift split at @xmath2 was imposed , allowing evolution in the sample to be investigated , see fig.1 . the high - z sample ( pale line )",
    "is composed of 38% of the total z - sample with v / vmax=0.72@xmath60.04 , showing strong evidence for luminosity evolution . the low - z sample ( dark line )",
    "is composed of 62% of the total z - sample with v / vmax=0.46@xmath60.03 .",
    "note : incompleteness corrections need to be applied to the faintest luminosity bins of the high - z sample .",
    "parameterization of the swire lf was performed and a comparison with low - z from iras was made . using mcmc ( kashyap 1998 ) & mle ( sandage , et al .",
    "1979 ) techniques to fit saunders et al .",
    "1990 parametric form of the lf , the best fitting mcmc and mle model fits to the swire lf@xmath4 are shown in fig.2 . a direct comparison to shupe et al .",
    "1998 lf@xmath7 is also shown in fig.2 . since this is an apriori model and not a fit it provides a fairly good description of our data .",
