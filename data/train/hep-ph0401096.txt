    "the prominence of the non - relativistic quark model is partly due to the simple and qualitatively satisfactory description of the masses and the magnetic moments of the ground state baryons , which it provides .",
    "notwithstanding this satisfactory phenomenology the model lacks dynamical consistency , as the high velocity of the confined quarks a priori invalidates the non - relativistic description of the constituent quarks .",
    "this problem may be overcome by recasting the model into poincar covariant form .",
    "it is shown here that the satisfactory description of the baryon magnetic moments carries over to this relativistic version of the quark model at the modest price of somewhat smaller constituent masses than commonly used , provided that the baryon wave function is determined by a fit to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the calculation of the electromagnetic observables of baryons in the relativistic quark model calls for a choice of kinematic subgroup of the group of poincar transformations , a choice which is referred to as the `` form of kinematics '' , in addition to the choice of wave function and current operator models .",
    "the three forms of kinematics , originally outlined by dirac  @xcite , are commonly referred to as `` instant '' , `` point '' , and `` front '' form kinematics .",
    "the corresponding kinematic subgroups of the group of poincar transformations are the group of rotations and translations at fixed time @xmath0 , the group of lorentz transformations @xmath1 , and the symmetry group on the light cone .",
    "the present relativistic quantum mechanical approach should be distinguished from the approach based on relativistic field theory , in which classes of feynman diagrams are summed in bethe - salpeter type equations , as e.g. in ref  @xcite .",
    "it was recently noted that a fair description of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons over the empirically known range of momentum transfer may be achieved with all these three forms of relativistic kinematics with simple algebraic wave function models for the confined three - quark system  @xcite .",
    "the model employed structureless constituent current operators , that are covariant under transformations of the corresponding kinematic subgroup .",
    "that work was stimulated by the fairly satisfactory results obtained in point form kinematics for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons with a very compact wave function model in ref .",

    "a calculation of the baryon magnetic moments and charge radii is carried out with the relativistic constituent quark model in all the three forms of relativistic kinematics .",
    "both the strange and the charm as well as the recently discovered doubly charm hyperons are considered .",
    "the functional form of the spatial wave function model is taken to be similar for all three forms of kinematics , although the spatial extent of the wave function , which is required for a satisfactory description of the electromagnetic form factor of the proton , depends on the form of kinematics .",
    "with instant and front form kinematics the calculated baryon magnetic moments are found to be very sensitive to both the wave function model and the value of the constituent mass . with point form",
    "kinematics the calculated magnetic moments of the nucleon are on the other hand found to be quite insensitive to the constituent mass .",
    "instead there is a sensitivity to the mass of the baryon , which leads to smaller values for the calculated magnetic moments of the heavy hyperons than with the other forms of kinematics . in instant and front form kinematics both the empirical magnetic moments and the charge radii of the strange hyperons",
    "are well reproduced with the same spatial wave function , as used for the nucleons .",
    "in contrast , reproduction of the empirical charge radius of the @xmath2 hyperon would in point form demand that its matter radius be more than twice that of the nucleon . even with such an extended wave function model the calculated magnetic moments of most of the strange hyperons remain somewhat small in point form kinematics .    in @xcite",
    "it was noted that the relativistic quark model gives reasonable values for the nucleon even for zero constituent mass . by considering the hyperon magnetic moments it is shown here that , while the constituent masses of the light flavor quark masses may be taken to be very small , agreement with the experimental magnetic moments requires finite values for the strange quark mass .    this paper is organized in the following way :",
