    "deviations of the precisely measured electroweak observables from the predictions of the sm @xcite enable one to search for the existence of new physics .",
    "although there are various possibilities for extending the sm , one of the simplest and well - motivated extension is the addition of an extra @xmath3 to its @xmath5 gauge structure @xcite .",
    "the z - pole and neutral current data can be used to search for and set limits on the existence of the @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "the z - pole observables are sensitive only to the @xmath6 mixing angle due to the modifications in the vector and axial couplings of the fermions to the z - boson . on the other hand ,",
    "off - z - pole @xmath7 data , and low energy @xmath2 , @xmath8-hadron and parity - violating @xmath9-hadron scattering experiments are sensitive to both @xmath6 mixing and @xmath10 mass @xcite",
    ". therefore , accompanying the z - pole data , the low - energy observables are particularly useful in establishing the constraints on the @xmath10 physics .",
    "for example , atomic parity violation experiments ( particularly for cesium ) has already been analyzed in this direction @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the implications of @xmath4 and charm ii data @xcite on the @xmath0 models by comparing them with the sm predictions @xcite . in the analysis",
    ", we illustrate two gut - motivated models and reach conclusions of general applicability .    in sec .",
    "2 we give the relevant formulae for the effective vector and axial couplings in the frame work of the @xmath0 models .",
    "moreover , we list sm expressions and derscribe the gut - motivated @xmath0 models that will be the subject matter of the analysis .    in sec .",
    "3 we give a detailed numerical analysis of the appropriate parameter space by taking into account both points implied by the charm ii data @xcite .    in sec .",
    "4 we conclude the work and remark on the interplay between low - energy and @xmath1- pole determinations of the parameter space .",
    "in addition to the usual sm gauge group , we consider an additional abelian group @xmath11 with coupling constant @xmath12 , under which the left - handed lepton doublets and right - handed charged leptons have charges @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the neutral vector bosons @xmath1 of @xmath15 and @xmath0 of @xmath11 mix with each other .",
    "the mass eigenstate vector bosons @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be obtained after diagonalizing the @xmath18 mass - squared matrix : @xmath19 which define the @xmath6 mixing angle @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0 effects can show up in various physical quantities whose comparison with the sm predictions allow us to constrain @xmath0 parameters in a model independent way .",
    "in general , @xmath10 effects can be tracked by their apprearence in four distinct physical quantities .",
    "firstly , due to mixing , @xmath21 is lighter than the canonical @xmath1 , so that the @xmath22 parameter predicted by @xmath21 mass is larger than the one predicted by @xmath1 mass .",
    "secondly , coupling of @xmath21 to fermions differs from those of @xmath1 due to the mixing in ( 1 ) .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath0 exchange will modify the neutral current amplitudes as an explicit function of the @xmath10 mass .",
    "finally , @xmath23 differs from the sm prediction because of the @xmath0 contribution to the @xmath22 parameter . in what follows",
    "we shall discuss all of these effects in the framework of the @xmath24 scattering .",
    "the low - energy four - fermion effective lagrangian relevant to the @xmath2 scattering can be written as @xmath25 which defines the effective vector coupling @xmath26 and axial coupling @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath2 scattering is a pure neutral current process mediated by both @xmath21 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath26 and @xmath27 carry the @xmath0 effects through the contribution of the intermediate vector bosons , and the modification of the fermion - vector boson couplings due to the mixing . in the @xmath0 model mentioned - above these couplings",
    "are given by @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the @xmath22 parameters of @xmath21 and @xmath28 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "next @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the tilded vector and axial couplings are given by @xmath37 where the subscript sm refers to the sm value of the associated quantity . here",
    "@xmath4 is the deviation of the @xmath30 from its @xmath38 value : @xmath39 it is the @xmath0 contribution to @xmath40 that causes a finite difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 . as we see @xmath0 contribution to @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "we identify @xmath26 in ( 4 ) and @xmath27 in ( 5 ) with the experimental result , and require the @xmath0 contributions at their right hand sides to close the gap between experimental result and the sm determination .",
    "we use the sm results evaluated for @xmath43 so that there is no contribution to a particular observable from the higgs loop .",
    "this is a convenient approach as we have a much more complicated higgs sector in @xmath0 models ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) with increased number of scalars whose contributions to a particular observable differ from the one in sm .",
    "moreover , the tree - level @xmath0 contributions in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) do already yield the relevant parameters of a @xmath0 model to be fixed at the leading order .",
    "namely , we assume loop corrections to ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) coming from the @xmath10 sector negligably small .",
    "although we treat @xmath0 effects at the tree- level , we take all the loop contributions into account when analyzing the sm contribution .",
    "one of the basic sm parameters entering ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) is the weak mixing angle @xmath40 whose meaning is to be fixed against the ambiguities coming from the renormalization scheme and scale . as was discussed in @xcite in detail , the value of @xmath40 extracted from @xmath44 in @xmath45 scheme at the scale @xmath44 is less sensitive to @xmath46 and most types of the new physics compared to the others .",
    "following , @xcite , we adopt this definition of @xmath40 to be denoted by @xmath47 from now on .",
    "consistent with this choice for @xmath40 , the sm expressions for vector and axial couplings in ( 8) and ( 9 ) are given by @xmath48 whose numerical values can be found in @xcite .    in the analysis below",
    "we shall restrict @xmath49 and @xmath20 by requiring ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) be satisfied within the experimental error bounds . in addition to this , we take into account the constraints coming from @xmath1 - pole data by requiring @xmath50 ( 10 ) be in the band induced by the present world average for @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath51 which puts an additional restriction on the allowed @xmath52 space .",
    "@xmath4 calculated from ( 13 ) includes @xmath46 effects already ; however , higgs effects are discarded by taking @xmath53 as mentioned before .",
    "although @xmath54 takes both negative and positive values , @xmath10 models require it be positive as @xmath55 is less than @xmath56 due to mixing .",
    "the lepton charges @xmath13 and @xmath14 and gauge coupling @xmath12 are model dependent . in literature",
    "there are various @xmath0 models @xcite with definite predictions for charges and gauge coupling . in this work",
    "we shall illustrate the constraints implied by charm ii results by considering two typical gut- motivated @xmath0 models . obviously , when choosing the models one should discard those that predict a right- handed neutrino as the form of the effective lagrangian ( 3 ) suggests .",
    "the first model is @xmath57 model coming from @xmath58 @xcite , and we call it model @xmath59 . in this model @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is a typical @xmath58 -inspired model in which @xmath11 charges are linear combinations of the @xmath3 groups @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "depending on the details of the symmetry breaking , @xmath12 differs from @xmath64 by a factor around unity .",
    "the second model we analyze is the one following from the breaking of the flipped @xmath65 when the higgs fields reside in the @xmath66 dimensional representation of @xmath67 @xcite . in this model @xmath68 and @xmath12",
    "is as in the first model .",
    "we call this model as model @xmath69 .    in the notation of equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 )",
    ", we have @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . since @xmath70",
    ", @xmath27 feels @xmath0 parameters only through @xmath73 type terms ( see ( 5 ) ) which is a weaker dependence than that of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , in model @xmath69 parameter space is expected to be constrained mainly by @xmath4 and @xmath26 .    in model @xmath59 , as @xmath71 , dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath0 parameters",
    "is amplified compared to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , one expects @xmath4 and @xmath27 mainly determine the appropriate parameter space .",
    "finally , one can also predict the relative magnitudes of the parameter spaces in two models . since @xmath74 , it is clear that in model @xmath59 one needs a wider parameter space than in model @xmath69 to close the gap between experiment and the sm . in the next section",
    "we shall quantify these qualitative arguments .",
    "charm ii collaboration @xcite has measured @xmath40 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 from the neutrino - electron scattering events using @xmath8 and @xmath75 beams with @xmath76 . on @xmath77 plane",
    "there are two candidate points coming from electron - neutrino scattering data",
    ". however lep results for @xmath78 @xcite prefer one of them at which @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "this solution , which we call point ( i ) , is close to the sm prediction so that it can be taken as a confirmation of the standard electroweak theory .",
    "the other point which is discarded by @xmath7 data has approximately @xmath81 .",
    "this solution , which we call point ( ii ) , is clearly far from being predictable by the sm . as noted in @xcite , point ( i )",
    "is choosen by assuming that the @xmath1-pole data is dominated by a single @xmath1 . in multi @xmath1 models , like the @xmath0 models under concern",
    ", it would be convenient to discuss the implications of both points for @xmath0 physics on equal footing .",
    "below we first analyze the allowed parameter space on @xmath82 plane for the point ( i ) , next we turn to the discussion of point ( ii ) .",
    "let us start discussing the implications of equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 10 ) with a rough analysis .",
    "equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) express experimental values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of the parameters of the extended model at hand . equation ( 10 ) , on the other hand , represents the restriction on the modification of @xmath22 parameter due to @xmath0 effects . as given in ( 13 ) @xmath4 ( 10 ) is restricted in a rather narrow error band .",
    "as is seen from equations ( 4)-(9 ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 explicitly depend on @xmath4 , unlike the atomic weak charge for which @xmath4 dependence almost cancel @xcite .    for a rough analysis of the parameter space at the point ( i )",
    ", one can neglect @xmath4 all together .",
    "then @xmath41 ( 8) reduces to the sm expression .",
    "moreover , @xmath83 , and this requires both @xmath84 and @xmath85 be small , which would be satisfied only by a small enough @xmath20 .",
    "that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are close to their sm values also confirms the need for a small @xmath20 , as this reduces the @xmath30 dependent terms in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) essentially to their sm expressions . in this limit , @xmath86 , and for @xmath87 type terms in ( 4 ) and ( 5 )",
    "be suppressed one needs a large @xmath49 , or equivalently , heavy enough @xmath28 . after making these rough observations we now turn to an exact numerical analysis of the allowed @xmath88 region for point ( i ) , which will be seen to imply constraints beyond these expectations as one considers the nonvanishing values of the @xmath22 parameter .    in the numerical analysis below we",
    "first express , via ( 10 ) , @xmath49 in terms of @xmath20 for a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "then we insert this solution to the expressions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . after expressing ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath4 in this way we let @xmath20 vary from zero to higher values , meanwhile",
    ", @xmath4 wanders in its phenomenologically allowed range of values determined by ( 13 ) . under the variation of these parameters",
    "we pick up those points for which ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) do remain in their allowed range of values .",
    "we first analyze model @xmath69 mentioned in the last section . in this model",
    "@xmath27 has a weaker dependence on the @xmath0 parameters compared to @xmath26 since @xmath89 .",
    "fig . 1 depicts the allowed parameter space for which ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 10 ) satisfy the existing phenomenological bounds .",
    "as we see from fig . 1 for small @xmath20 , @xmath49 wanders in a rather wide range of values .",
    "for example , for @xmath90 , @xmath49 varies from 8 to 80 which implies @xmath91 . as @xmath20 increases , not only the upper bound but also the lower bound on @xmath49 decreases .",
    "for example , for @xmath92 , @xmath49 ranges from 1.3 to 6 , that is , @xmath93 therefore @xmath17 is considerably light in this case .",
    "moreover , as @xmath20 increases further , the allowed range of @xmath49 gets thinner and thinner and @xmath94 settles approximately to @xmath95 .",
    "this goes on until @xmath96 at which @xmath26 hits its lower bound , and there are no ( @xmath97 ) pairs satisfying ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 10 ) beyond this point . in sum , one concludes that for model @xmath69 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . for negative @xmath20 values , graph is approximately mirror symmetric of fig.1 with respect to @xmath49 axis .",
    "@xmath20 takes its minimum value of @xmath100 at which @xmath26 reaches its upper bound .",
    "close to @xmath101 , @xmath49 drops to @xmath102 , yielding a light @xmath17 .",
    "now we analyze model @xmath59 to indentify the appropriate region it implies in the ( @xmath97 ) plane .",
    "as we recall from the previous section , unlike model @xmath69 , in this model both @xmath27 is more sensitive to the @xmath0 parameters than @xmath26 .",
    "fig.2 depicts the appropriate ( @xmath103 ) pairs for which ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 10 ) reside in their allowed band of values .",
    "here we show only @xmath104 part of the entire @xmath20 range to magnify the region of maximum @xmath20 value .",
    "@xmath105 part behaves similarly to fig.1 . as we see from fig .",
    "2 , the allowed range of @xmath20 is rather wide compared to model @xmath69 .",
    "this is what was expected by the discussions at the end of the last section . to be quantitave let us discuss some special points on fig .",
    "2 . here @xmath106 at which @xmath27 hits its upper bound so that there is no acceptable ( @xmath97 ) values beyond this point .",
    "consistent with the comperatively large values of @xmath20 , @xmath49 takes its smallest allowed value , that is , it takes the value of unity for every @xmath20 allowed , including the @xmath107 part not shown on fig .",
    "2 . for negative @xmath20 values",
    "the allowed region is approximately symmetric to fig .",
    "2 with respect to @xmath49 axis and extends up to -1.533 at which @xmath27 reaches its upper bound .",
    "differently than the positive @xmath20 range , here @xmath49 does not take the value of unity altough it remains close to unity , lowering as low as 1.005 , for @xmath20 values near @xmath108 .",
    "athough @xmath109 was never realized for model @xmath69 , it is the case here .",
    "this shows that for model @xmath59 the envelope of the allowed ( @xmath97 ) values is strictly determined by @xmath4 in ( 10 ) , as @xmath109 is consistent with @xmath4 constraint . for model @xmath69 , however , @xmath4 has not the full control over @xmath49 values for a given @xmath20 , other parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , constrain the total @xmath49 range .    for both models @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath59 we have a wider range of allowed negative @xmath20 values which stems from the fact that negative @xmath20 changes the sign of the cross terms in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , and thus , lowers the value of the right hand side compared to the positive @xmath20 case .",
    "this then requires a wider range of @xmath20 values .",
    "this widening of the allowed negative @xmath20 interval is also seen in the apv determination of @xcite",
    ". however , one notes that , in general , the allowed ranges of @xmath20 is much wider than those of the apv determination .",
    "nevertheless , a direct comparison is not possible , because in @xcite , experimental data are taken with an error of two standard deviations , and top mass is assigned a much lower value of @xmath110 than the present analysis .",
    "we conclude this subsection by noting that the allowed ranges of the mixing angle and @xmath17 mass depend on the value of the normalized @xmath11 coupling @xmath111 .",
    "if it is small , mainly the @xmath1-pole observable @xmath4 takes control of the @xmath0 parameter space , and the low - energy observables @xmath26 and @xmath27 do not hit their phenomenological bounds until the mixing angle takes relatively large values . on the other hand , when @xmath111 is large , the low - energy observables become more decisive on the @xmath0 parameter space .",
    "therefore , one rhoughly concludes that when the coupling constant of the extra @xmath3 is large ( small ) compared to the weak coupling low - energy observables ( @xmath1- pole observables ) determine the allowed parameter space .      in sec .",
    "3.1 we have discussed the implications of charm ii candidate , point ( i ) , for the @xmath0 parameters .",
    "the other candidate , point ( ii ) , discarded by the @xmath7 data , deserves also a discussion because it may be of interest in @xmath0 models in which off- @xmath1- pole data may be explained by the contribution of the @xmath0 propagator effects . before an attempt to confirm the @xmath7 data",
    ", one should first prove the existence of points on ( @xmath97 ) plane solving ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 10 ) simultaneously .",
    "the transition from the point ( i ) to point ( ii ) involves the exchange @xmath81 .",
    "thus , it is convenient to work with @xmath112 and @xmath113 which are symmmetric and antisymmetric under @xmath114 , respectively . after interchanging the left hand sides of ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    "can be expressed in terms of the corresponding sm ones and the other parameters . however , an attempt to find a consistent solution of @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath4 for a given model parameters runs into difficulty immediately .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "@xmath115 is symmetric under @xmath117 so it points to the ( @xmath97 ) regions we discussed in sec .",
    "however , @xmath116 is antisymmetric under @xmath81 and requiers a completely different ( @xmath97 ) set for being satisfied .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath116 and the corresponding sm quantity @xmath118 are not close to each other as @xmath115 and @xmath119 do .",
    "in fact , a numerical analysis of not only the models we have illustrated in sec .",
    "3.1 but also the ones listed in @xcite confirms this observation .",
    "it is interesting that the present analysis also prefers the charm ii result for point ( i ) .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the low energy @xmath2 scattering and @xmath1 -pole data against a general abelian extension of the sm . in our analysis",
    "we have used the results of charm ii collaboration @xcite which reported two candidate points for the effective vector and axial couplings .",
    "we have considered both points in our analysis and found that the charm ii candidate discarded by the @xmath7 data does not lead a consistent solution for the gut -motivated models considered .",
    "the other point , which is in the close vicinity of the sm predictions for effective vector and axial couplings , leads solution spaces much wider than the apv determination of @xcite .",
    "the analysis concludes that when the gauge coupling associated to the extra @xmath3 is small ( large ) compared to the weak coupling parameter space is determined mainly by @xmath22 -parameter constraint ( low- energy neutral current data ) ."
