    "the generalized seniority scheme  @xcite , or broken pair approximation  @xcite , has long been proposed as a truncation scheme for the nuclear shell model , based on pairing correlations , with the potential to dramatically reduce the dimensionality of the nuclear shell - model problem .",
    "the generalized seniority scheme has also been proposed as a microscopic foundation for the phenomenologically successful interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite , through the otsuka - arima - iachello mapping  @xcite .",
    "the underlying premise of the generalized seniority scheme is that the ground state of an even - even nucleus can be well approximated by a condensate built from _ collective _ @xmath3 pairs .",
    "these are defined as a specific linear combination of pairs of nucleons in the different valence orbitals , each pair coupled to angular momentum zero . a shell - model calculation for the ground state and low - lying states",
    "can then be carried out in a truncated space , consisting of states built from a condensate of collective @xmath3 pairs together with a small number @xmath4 ( the _ generalized seniority _ ) of nucleons not forming part of an @xmath3 pair .",
    "although the generalized seniority approach has been applied in various contexts  @xcite , only recently has it been benchmarked against calculations carried out in the full shell - model space , with realistic interactions .",
    "comparisons have so far focused on semimagic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "systematic comparisons for both even - mass and odd - mass @xmath0 isotopes , across the full @xmath5 shell ( @xmath6 ) , with the fpd6  @xcite and gxpf1  @xcite interactions , are presented in  @xcite . these benchmark calculations for semimagic nuclei are based on the assumption of at most one broken pair , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath7 for even - mass isotopes , which is found to provide a quantitatively successful reproduction of many of the full - space results ( energies , occupations , and electromagnetic observables ) for the lowest - lying ( and , in particular , yrast ) states . in the interior of the shell , where both valence protons and neutrons are present , the obvious challenge to the generalized seniority truncation is the seniority - nonconserving , or pair - breaking , nature of the proton - neutron quadrupole - quadrupole interaction  @xcite .",
    "as this interaction induces deformation , it also suppresses pairing correlations .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the viability of a highly - truncated generalized seniority description as one moves beyond semimagic nuclei , introducing valence nucleons of both types , and to map the breakdown of this description . the generalized seniority scheme , as a simple representation of the full nuclear shell - model problem , is foremost of conceptual interest .",
    "the generalized seniority model space of generalized seniority @xmath4 is equivalent to the space spanned by bcs states with at most @xmath4 quasiparticles , projected onto definite particle number .",
    "therefore , the principal question being addressed by the present calculations is to what extent the shell - model wave functions and predictions quantitatively reflect a simple structure based on bcs - like pairing , in a form which nonetheless fully accounts for particle number conservation .",
    "however , the generalized seniority scheme may also be of computational relevance , as a practical truncation scheme . in the @xmath5 shell ,",
    "the dimensions of the full shell - model space for semimagic and near - semimagic nuclei are computationally tractable . however , truncation is still necessary if single - particle spaces significantly larger than the @xmath5 shell are considered .",
    "a generalized seniority truncation is more likely to be advantageous for weakly - deformed nuclei near closed - shell , in large single - particle spaces , than for strongly - deformed nuclei with large numbers of both protons and neutrons in the valence shell .",
    "we extend the investigations of the @xmath0 isotopes ( @xmath8 )  @xcite into the interior of the @xmath5 shell , to the even - even @xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) isotopes , establishing a benchmark comparison of results obtained in the generalized seniority truncation against results obtained in the full shell - model space .",
    "we consider calculations truncated to one broken proton pair plus one broken neutron pair , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 .",
    "these calculations should be viewed as a baseline , in that they are based on the most restricted generalized seniority truncation for both protons and neutron .",
    "calculations involving more broken pairs could be expected to provide a description of the dynamics which extends further into the interior of the shell .",
    "the present study is therefore also intended to provide an indication of the dependences upon valence proton and neutron numbers , interactions , and observables likely to influence successful treatment of nuclei in such spaces of higher generalized seniority .",
    "the generalized seniority basis , in a proton - neutron scheme , and computational method are summarized in section  [ sec - methods ] .",
    "then , calculations for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 isotopes in the generalized seniority scheme are compared with full shell - model calculations , for level energies ( section  [ sec - results - energy ] ) , orbital occupations ( section  [ sec - results - occ ] ) , and electromagnetic observables ( section  [ sec - results - trans ] ) .",
    "preliminary results were presented in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the construction of the generalized seniority basis for like particles  @xcite and its extension to a proton - neutron scheme .",
    "let @xmath12 be the creation operator for a particle in the shell - model orbital @xmath13 , with angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath14 .",
    "then the collective @xmath3 pair of the generalized seniority scheme is defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 runs over the active orbitals , and @xmath17 .",
    "this operator creates a linear combination of pairs in different orbitals @xmath16 , with amplitudes @xmath18 .",
    "a basis state within the generalized seniority scheme then consists of a `` condensate '' of collective pairs , together with @xmath4 additional nucleons not forming part of a collective @xmath3 pair . the number @xmath4 is termed the _",
    "generalized seniority_. thus , if we consider semimagic nuclei , so only like valence particles ( all neutrons or all protons ) are present , the @xmath19 condensate state is constructed as @xmath20 , with angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "states with @xmath7 and angular momentum @xmath22 are then obtained as @xmath23 , states with @xmath24 as @xmath25^{(j ) } \\,\\tket{}$ ] , _ etc .",
    "_ , where , if @xmath26 is the number of valence nucleons , @xmath27 is the total number of pairs .    to construct a generalized seniority basis ,",
    "the parameters @xmath18 must first be determined .",
    "this is usually accomplished variationally , so as to minimize the energy functional @xmath28  @xcite , subject to the conventional normalization @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-condensate state has the same form as a number - projected bcs ground state , and these @xmath18 coefficients are related to bcs occupancy parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 by @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the generalized seniority states as defined above are in general unnormalized and nonorthogonal ( for @xmath33 , they also form an overcomplete set ) .",
    "however , a suitable basis is obtained by a gram - schmidt procedure , which yields orthonormal basis states as linear combinations of the original states , _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath7 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is simply a counting index for the orthogonalized states .",
    "several approaches  @xcite have been developed for evaluating matrix elements of one - body and two - body operators in the generalized seniority basis .",
    "the present calculations make use of recurrence relations derived in  @xcite , where the notation and methods used in the present work are also established in detail .",
    "pairs for @xmath1 , for neutrons  ( top ) and protons  ( bottom ) , and for the fpd6  ( left ) and gxpf1  ( right ) interactions .",
    "amplitudes are obtained by the variational prescription ( see text ) . ]",
    "a generalized seniority basis can be defined for nuclei with valence particles of both types via a proton - neutron scheme , that is , by taking all possible products of proton and neutron generalized seniority states , with generalized seniorities @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "here we consider states with one broken pair of each type [ @xmath11 ] and thus have basis states @xmath39^{(j)}.\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath40 appearing in the proton collective pair operator [ @xmath41 and the coefficients @xmath42 appearing in the neutron collective pair operator [ @xmath43 are distinct , and these are chosen independently , by minimizing @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the values of the amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath42 obtained in this manner for the @xmath1 isotopes are shown in figure  [ fig - alpha ] , for both the fpd6 and gxpf1 interactions .",
    "the variational expression @xmath46 for the proton @xmath3 pair has no manifest dependence upon neutron number and , similarly , the variational expression @xmath47 for the neutron @xmath3 pair has no manifest dependence upon proton number .",
    "however , an implicit dependence is induced , in each case , by the @xmath48-dependent definitions of the interaction two - body matrix elements , which are proportional to @xmath49 for fpd6  @xcite or @xmath50 for gxpf1  @xcite .",
    "a simple multiplicative scaling of the hamiltonian would not affect the collective pair structure , but note that here rather the @xmath48-dependent two - body contribution varies in strength relative to the @xmath48-independent single - particle energies .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath42 in the shell interior vary slightly ( @xmath51 ) between successive isotopic chains , and the values of @xmath40 vary slightly along each isotopic chain [ figure  [ fig - alpha ] ( bottom ) ] .    for semimagic nuclei , the size of the generalized seniority basis is the same as for the shell - model problem with only @xmath4 particles in the same set of orbitals , regardless of the number of @xmath3 pairs .",
    "thus , the generalized seniority model space with one broken pair ( @xmath52 for any even @xmath0 isotope taken in the @xmath5 shell has the same dimension as the shell - model space for @xmath53{ca}$ ]   dimension @xmath54 for @xmath21 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , _ etc . _",
    "similarly , if both valence protons and neutrons are present , the basis size is the same as for the shell - model problem with only @xmath36 protons and @xmath37 nucleons .",
    "thus , the generalized seniority model space with one broken proton pair and one broken neutron pair [ @xmath11 ] for any even - even nucleus taken in the @xmath5 shell has the same dimension as the shell - model space for @xmath59{ti}$ ]   dimension @xmath60 for @xmath21 , @xmath61 for @xmath56 , @xmath62 for @xmath58 , _ etc . _ for comparison , the dimensions of the full shell - model spaces in the @xmath5 shell are shown , in the @xmath22 scheme , in figure  [ fig - dim - pf ] .    -scheme shell - model spaces for nuclei in the @xmath5 shell , with @xmath63 , shown for ( a )  @xmath21 and ( b )  @xmath56 . the dimension of the generalized seniority model space with one broken pair ( @xmath7 ) is shown for comparison with the semimagic @xmath0 isotopes , and the dimension of the generalized seniority model space with one broken pair of each type [ @xmath11 ]",

    "therefore , the ground - state energies obtained in @xmath19 and @xmath7 spaces are identical .",
    "[ in contrast , for nuclei in the interior of the shell , the ground state obtained in the @xmath11 space is not in general the @xmath74 @xmath3-pair condensate , and these states are considered separately in figure  [ fig - gs ] . ]",

    ". it would be valuable to have a systematic understanding of how this dependence might reflect underlying quantitative properties of the interaction . as noted in  @xcite , a decomposition of the interaction into an appropriate set of pairing and nonpairing ( _ e.g. _ , quadrupole ) components through spectral distribution theory , as in  @xcite",

    "this suggests that it may be possible to determine the @xmath3-pair amplitudes   which in turn determine the occupancies in the @xmath3-pair condensate and thus the starting point for improvement with broken pairs   more optimally .",
    "for instance , an alternative prescription for obtaining the collective pair amplitudes by angular - momentum projection of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov intrinsic state  @xcite directly takes into account the influence of @xmath165 interactions and yields significantly modified spectra for transitional nuclei in a nucleon pair approximation  @xcite .",
