    "the evolution with center of mass energy of the total and elastic cross sections in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions , and the properties of multi  particle production in these interactions remain an important open problem in particle physics .",
    "this problem is clearly of significant intrinsic interest , but it has also important phenomenological implications : on one hand the estimate of the properties of hadronic interactions is obviously important at lhc to model the background in the search for higgs particles and possible forms of `` new physics '' , on the other hand the detailed properties of hadronic interactions properties is important in cosmic ray studies .",
    "the highest energy cosmic ray particles can only be detected indirectly observing the extensive air showers that they produce in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the development of air showers is determined by the hadronic cross sections and the properties of particle production in hadronic interactions , and therefore the interpretation of the available ( and future ) data depends also on theoretical assumptions about hadronic interactions .",
    "hadrons are composite objects containing quarks and gluons , and it is natural to relate the cross sections for hadron collisions to the more elementary interactions between their parton constituents . the precise method to do this remains however an unsolved problem .",
    "a possible approach is provided by the so called `` minijet '' models @xcite , where the total and elastic cross sections are obtained using an eikonal formalism , in terms of the quantity @xmath1 that has the physical meaning of the average number of elementary interactions at impact parameter @xmath2 and c.m . energy @xmath3 ( for earlier work on the importance of minjets see @xcite ) .",
    "an attractive feature of this approach is that it allows to compute the distribution of the number of elementary interactions that happen in a single hadron collision .",
    "this distribution can then be used , with the inclusion of a few additional assumptions , in montecarlo codes to predict properties of particle production that can be tested experimentally .",
    "for example it is simple to see that events with a large number of parton scatterings must have a larger multiplicity and a more complex structure .    the original version of the minijet approach and several subsequent ones did not include in a consistent way in their formalism the inelastic diffractive processes . following an approach introduced long ago by good and walker @xcite , several authors @xcite have indicated possible methods to include diffraction using a multi - channel eikonal formalism . in this work we rediscuss this problem , and suggest an alternative method to include the diffractive cross section in the eikonal formalism .",
    "this method is mathematically equivalent to the multi ",
    "channel eikonal method but offers additional physical insight .    the fundamental physical idea to explain the existence of inelastic diffraction introduced by good and walker @xcite is to assume that inelastic diffraction emerges because an interacting hadron can be seen as a superposition of different states that undergo unequal absorptions .",
    "it is natural , as originally proposed by miettinen and pumplin @xcite , to identify these `` transmission eigenstates '' as different `` configurations '' of the parton constituents inside a hadron . in this theoretical framework",
    "the estimate of inelastic diffraction requires some understanding of the ensemble of such parton configurations .",
    "this appears as a daunting task .",
    "a possible approach is to make the dramatic approximation of reducing the space of parton configurations to a finite dimensional space ( in fact spanned by as few as two or three base vectors ) and to construct explicitly a matrix transition operator .",
    "an explicit example ( originally constructed in @xcite ) of this approach is also discussed in this work .",
    "the alternative method we propose here is to construct a mapping from the space of the hadron configurations to the real positive numbers , so that the number of elementary interactions for the configuration @xmath4 is @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 the average over all configurations ) .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath7 ( together with a model for @xmath8 ) is then sufficient to compute the total cross section and its different components ( elastic , absorption and diffraction ) .",
    "the consistent inclusion of diffraction in the theory is very important , because it changes dramatically the relation between the inclusive parton cross sections and the directly observable hadron cross sections .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we start discussing the problem of multiple interactions in a narrower but better defined sense , that is limiting our considerations to hard high @xmath0 interactions that on one hand can be easily identified experimentally , and on the other hand have an inclusive cross section that is calculable in perturbative qcd using the standard parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "we will show that the calculation of the multiplicity distribution of these hard interactions requires additional theoretical constructs .    in section  [ sec : total ]",
    "after rewiewing some general formalism about total and elastic cross sections we discuss a standard , single channel , version of the eikonal formalism , that has been used in the original minijet model of durand and pi and in many other works .    in section  [ sec",
    ": diff ] , after a brief introduction to inelastic diffraction we recall the basic ideas of the good and walker @xcite method , and then we discuss our implementation of this multi  component ansatz in terms of the function @xmath9 ( where @xmath7 is a real positive variable ) .",
    "we call the function @xmath9 the `` effective configuration probability distribution '' .    in section  [ sec :",
    "explicit ] we present a simple form for the function @xmath9 that depends on a single parameter , and use this form , together with a ( 2 parameters ) parametrization of the function @xmath1 to describe the available data on @xmath10 and @xmath11 scattering at collider energies .",
    "in section  [ sec : energy ] we discuss the energy dependence of the parameters of our model and discuss extrapolations to higher energy ( lhc and ultra high energy cosmic rays ) .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] offers some final considerations .",
    "the problem of multiple interactions in a hadron ",
    "hadron collisions is usually discussed in the context of a calculation of the total ( or inelastic ) cross section and referring to the _ total _ number of elementary interactions in a collision .",
    "such a general discussion has serious difficulties .",
    "theoretically the concept of the `` total '' number of elementary interactions in a collision is not really well defined .",
    "for example , one usually divides the elementary interactions into two classes : `` soft '' and `` hard '' choosing a rather arbitrary cutoff in @xmath0 , however `` soft '' interactions can not be considered as truly elementary , since they are effective processes , as for instance a `` pomeron exchange '' that , after decades of efforts , remains a somewhat elusive concept ; and the theoretical `` counting '' of the number of interactions in a collision has significant ambiguities . on the other hand , experimentally it is essentially impossible to measure the number of soft interactions in one collision , and one can at best obtain only some partial and indirect information from the study of particle multiplicities .    to avoid these difficulties , in this section",
    "we will discuss a more limited but much better defined problem , namely the production of parton ",
    "parton scatterings with a transverse momentum larger than a chosen threshold .",
    "if the threshold @xmath12 , is sufficiently large ( above a few gev ) these scatterings are , at least in principle , experimentally identifiable as pairs of back to back jets .",
    "moreover , given the colliding hadron pdf s , the inclusive differential cross section for the production of pairs of jets can be estimated in perturbation theory from the well known expression : @xmath13 in this expression @xmath14 [ @xmath15 $ ] is the parton distribution function ( pdf ) for parton of type @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in the hadron @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ar the scale @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the differential cross section for the parton  parton scattering of type @xmath22 at the squared c.m .",
    "energy for the parton ",
    "parton interaction @xmath23 .",
    "the fractional momenta @xmath24 are connected to the rapidities @xmath25 of the observed jets by the relation : @xmath26\\ ] ]    integrating equation ( [ eq : jet1 ] ) over the phase space region @xmath27 and all allowed jet rapidities one obtains the inclusive jet cross section : @xmath28 more in general , one could consider the production of jet pairs in a more limited region of phase space selecting for example only jets in a certain range of rapidities , with appropriate choice of the limits in the integration over phase space .",
    "the discussion below remains valid also in this case , and in the following we will denote with @xmath29 the inclusive production of jets in a fixed kinematical region determined by @xmath12 and appropriate cuts in the jet rapidities , leaving the dependence on these kinematical cuts implicit .    the quantity @xmath30 is a cross section for parton  parton interactions , and therefore must be interpreted in the appropriate way .",
    "its physical meaning is to give the _ inclusive _ cross section for the production of jet  pairs in the chosen kinematical region .",
    "this means that when a detector collects the integrated luminosity @xmath31 , the expected number of jet pairs is @xmath32 . since the total number of inelastic scattering events is @xmath33 , the ratio @xmath34 is the average number of jet pairs produced in one inelastic interaction . in principle",
    "it is possible , and in fact it will happen for @xmath12 sufficiently small and/or @xmath3 sufficiently large , that @xmath35 exceeds @xmath36 .",
    "this simply implies that some events must contain more than one parton ",
    "parton interaction .    in general , an inelastic event can have 0,1,2 or more hard interactions .",
    "a natural problem is the estimate of the relative frequencies of events that have jet multiplicity @xmath17 .",
    "the probability @xmath37 that an inelastic event contains exactly @xmath17  pairs of jets can be expressed as the ratio : @xmath38 the partial cross sections @xmath39 must satisfy the sum rules : @xmath40 @xmath41 and therefore @xmath42    it is important to stress that the set of partial cross sections @xmath39 , or equivalently the probabilities @xmath43 are observable quantities . for large",
    "@xmath12 the identification of the hard interactions is experimentaly straightforward , however the inclusive jet cross section @xmath29 is much smaller than @xmath36 and the jet multiplicity distribution becomes `` trivial '' and only @xmath44 and @xmath45 are different from zero . for @xmath12",
    "sufficiently small the jet multiplicity distribution become broader , and the probability to find more than one hard scattering in a single event becomes significant ; however at the same time the experimental identification of the hard scatterings becomes more difficult .",
    "at lhc it should however be possible to identify a value @xmath12 sufficiently small to result in an interesting multiplicity distribution of hard interactions , and sufficiently large to allow the measurement of such a distribution .",
    "such an experimental study should be compared with a theoretical prediction .",
    "the calculation of the multiplicity distribution of the hard interactions is in fact a very difficult , unsolved problem , that , as we will discuss in the following , requires the introduction of new ideas , beyond the use of the standard pdf s , that are only sufficient for the calculation of the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "one may note that the obvious sum rule ( [ eq : sumj1 ] ) actually implies that the calculation of the partial cross sections requires unavoidably a complete theory for the inelastic hadron ",
    "hadron cross section .    as a first step toward the calculation of the set of partial cross sections @xmath39",
    "one can note that it is natural to expect that collisions at different impact parameter will result in a different number of hard interactions , with small ( large ) @xmath2 corresponding to a larger ( smaller ) number of interactions .",
    "the _ average _ number of interactions at a fixed impact parameter @xmath2 can be calculated as : @xmath46 ( where we have left implicit the integration limits over @xmath0 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) . the expression ( [ eq : jet4 ] ) differs from equation ( [ eq : jet2a ] ) for three reasons : ( i ) it replaces the pdf s @xmath49 with the impact parameter dependent pdf s @xmath50 ; ( ii ) it includes two additional integrations over @xmath51 and @xmath52 that describe the positions in transverse space of the partons inside the two hadrons ; ( iii ) the function @xmath53 is also included .",
    "the impact parameter dependent pdf s @xmath54 describe the probability to find a parton of type @xmath16 in hadron @xmath55 with fractional longitudinal momentum @xmath56 at transverse position @xmath2 ( with respect to the hadron c.m . ) .",
    "these functions are related to the standard pdf s by the relation : @xmath57    the function @xmath58 describe the probability density that two partons ( each in a different hadron ) separated by the distance @xmath2 in transverse space interact .",
    "the function has the normalization : @xmath59 the simplest choice for @xmath60 , is a delta function ( @xmath61 ) , or more in general ( but at the cost of introducing a new parameter ) a gaussian of width @xmath62 .    using equations ( [ eq : fnorm ] ) and ( [ eq : pnorm ] ) it is simple to verify that integrating @xmath63 over all impact parameters one obtains the correct result : @xmath64    the physical interpretation of equation ( [ eq : jet4 ] ) is very straightforward . to obtain the expected number of hard scattering in a hadron collision at impact parameter @xmath2 one must integrate over the distribution of the partons in trasverse space around the center of mass of the colliding hadrons .",
    "the standard pdf s integrate over this transverse space variables , and are therefore insufficient for the calculation , and are only capable of giving the inclusive result .    to proceed in the calculation",
    "one must obtain informations about the impact parameter dependent pdf s .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is to assume that the dependence on impact parameter of the @xmath65 functions can be factorized : @xmath66 where the function @xmath67 satisfies the normalization condition : @xmath68 with this factorization assumption the quantity @xmath69 can be written as : @xmath70 where the `` hadron overlap function '' @xmath71 is : @xmath72 and ( using ( [ eq : pnorm ] ) and ( [ eq : rhonorm1 ] ) ) satisfies the normalization condition : @xmath73    a reasonable first approximation for the overlap function @xmath71 proposed by durand and pi @xcite is to estimate it from the electromagnetic form factor of the colliding hadrons ( see appendix  [ sec : overlap ] ) .",
    "another ( more phenomenological ) approach has been to assume a gaussian form , of a superposition of gaussians .    it should however be stressed that the factorization hypothesis ( [ eq : factorization ] ) has no serious motivation beyond its simplicity , and it is likely to be incorrect .",
    "in fact , the impact parameter pdf s can be in principle calculated from the generalized parton distribution functions ( gpdf s ) @xcite .",
    "work on this subject is in progress .",
    "the need to consider the dependence on the transverse degrees of freedom introduces a serious complication and uncertainty in the calculation of the partial cross sections @xmath39 , but unfortunately , even having a good theoretical control of the overlap function @xmath71 ( or better a detailed knowledge of the impact parameter dependent pdf s ) is not sufficient to estimate the partial cross sections .    to complete the calculation one must make some hypothesis about the fluctuations in the number of hard interactions for collisions at a fixed impact parameter ( and c.m .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is to assume that the fluctuations are simply poissonian .",
    "the partial jet cross sections are then calculable integrating over all impact parameters the poisson probability : @xmath74    the hypothesis that the multiplicity distribution of the hard interactions at a given impact parameter is poissonian is however not necessarily correct , and some simple considerations suggest that in fact this distribution is considerably broader than a poissonian . an argument in this direction",
    "can be developed as follows . at the instant",
    "@xmath75 a hadron can be described as an ensemble of partons each having a certain longitudinal momentum @xmath56 and a trasverse position @xmath76 .",
    "the set of values @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the complete set of quantum numbers of each parton ) is the `` instantaneous configuration '' of the hadron and will be denoted with the symbol @xmath4 .",
    "the probability to find hadron @xmath55 in a certain instantaneous configuration @xmath4 can be denoted as @xmath79 with the normalization condition : @xmath80 where the integration over @xmath81 indicates formally the sum over all possible configurations .",
    "the interaction between ( for example ) two protons , in the c.m .",
    "frame , lasts a crossing time @xmath82 , that can be estimated as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the linear size of the proton of order 0.5  fm . because of the lorentz length contraction the crossing time shrinks @xmath85    the time required for the radiation and absorption of partons , that is for changing the parton configurations is of order @xmath84 and is therefore much longer than the interaction time",
    "it is therefore a reasonable approximation to assume that during one interaction the hadrons appear as `` frozen '' each into its own configuration .",
    "the expected number of hard interactions in a collision of impact parameter @xmath2 is determined by the parton configurations of the two colliding hadrons .",
    "if the configuration is composed by few hard partons , as for example is the case when most of the hadron energy is carried by the valence quarks , the number of hard scattering is suppressed , while if the configurations contain many gluons with fractional energy of order @xmath86 the number of hard interactions is enhanced .",
    "we will denote as @xmath87 the expected number of hard interactions in a collision at impact parameter @xmath2 between two hadrons with configurations @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "integrating over all possible hadron configurations one must recover the expected value of the jet multiplicity , therefore we can write formally : @xmath90    if we make the further assumption that the actual number of interactions in a single collision at impact parameter @xmath2 with the hadrons in the configurations @xmath88 and @xmath89 has a poisson distribution around the expected value , we can now write the partial jet cross sections as : @xmath91^k}{k ! }   ~\\exp \\left [ -n_{\\rm jet}(b , { \\mathbb{c}_1},{\\mathbb{c}_2 } ) \\right ] \\right \\ } \\label{eq : partial1}\\ ] ]    of course equation ( [ eq : partial1 ] ) is only a formal solution of our problem since we have not yet developed the instruments to estimate the probability of the different configurations and to perform the integration over the configurations space .    in order to make progress we will make the assumption that the expected value of the jet multiplicity for a certain configuration of the hadrons is related to the averaged one by the factorized relation : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a real positive number . with this simplifying assumption",
    "we can construct a function @xmath9 that is independent from @xmath2 : @xmath94   \\label{eq : palpha1}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to see that because of the normalization condition ( [ eq : ccnorm ] ) one has : @xmath95 consistently with the interpretation of @xmath9 as a probability density ; moreover because of equation ( [ eq : conf0 ] ) one has also that : @xmath96    using the definition of ( [ eq : palpha1 ] ) one can rewrite ( [ eq : partial1 ] ) in the simpler form : @xmath97 \\right \\ } \\label{eq : partial2}\\ ] ] in this equation we have finally arrived to write the jet multiplicity distribution in terms of @xmath98 and the function @xmath9 , that is unknown , but has fixed normalization and first moment .",
    "the expression for the partial jet cross sections given in equation ( [ eq : pjet0 ] ) ) that was calculated ignoring the effects of fluctuations in the parton configurations is recovered in the limit where the function @xmath9 has vanishing width and reduces to the form @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to see ( using equation ( [ eq : palpha2 ] ) ) that one has : @xmath100 in agreement with equation ( [ eq : kmed ] ) .",
    "the second moment of the jet multiplicity distribution can be expressed as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the variance of the @xmath9 distribution . using the factorization hypothesis ( [ eq : factorization1 ] ) one can rewrite equation ( [ eq : wwa ] ) as : @xmath103 ^ 2   \\label{eq : wwb}\\ ] ] the width of the jet multiplicity distribution",
    "is therefore determined by the geometry of the hadronic matter ( that is from the shape of the overlap function @xmath71 ) _ and _ from the variance @xmath104 of the function @xmath9 .",
    "note that the simple eikonal model corresponds to a vanishing @xmath104 and therefore to the minimum possible @xmath105 ( for a fixed overlap function @xmath71 ) .",
    "the partial cross sections @xmath39 and the quantity @xmath106 are ( at least in principle ) measurable with observations of the jet multiplicity distribution . from these measurements",
    "one can obtain information about the properties of the function @xmath9 .",
    "in fact we have already some ( indirect ) information about the jet multiplicity distribution , and there are indications that predictions based on the simple eikonal approach are not adequate .",
    "some of the most sophisticated montecarlo instruments for the study of high energy hadron collisions , such as pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite include a treatment of multi  parton interactions following the simple eikonal model .",
    "the algorithms for multi  parton interactions in these montecarlo codes compute an inclusive jet cross section @xmath29 , assume an overlap function @xmath71 , and them generate a number of elementary interactions according to the probability distribution of equation ( [ eq : pjet0 ] ) or equivalently of equation ( [ eq : partial2 ] ) with @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "in most cases the presence of multiple interactions can not be experimentally resolved but is detectable statistically , for example from fluctuations in the charged particles multiplicity distribution .",
    "in order to reproduce the broad fluctuations of the data , it appears necessary to construct some _ ad hoc _ functional form for the overlap function .",
    "for example pythia @xcite uses a double  gaussian with a denser core and more extended halo .",
    "the overlap function @xmath71 however ( as will be discussed in more detail in the following ) in principle also determines the @xmath75 distribution of elastic scattering , and therefore one does not have the freedom to modify it in an arbitrary way .",
    "the introduction of a non vanishing variance for the function @xmath9 allows to modify the width of the jet multiplicity distribution without modifications of the overlap function @xmath71 .",
    "one open problem in high energy hadron collisions , that is likely to be relevant in the interpretation of future data on possible manifestations of new physics in high energy collisions is the problem of the so called `` underlying event '' .",
    "the observations @xcite show that in events with the presence of a high @xmath0 scattering , the `` environment '' that accompany the observed jets has an average transverse momentum higher than what is found in minimum bias events .",
    "montecarlo codes like herwig , isajet or pythia at present describe only partially these effects @xcite .",
    "the origin of a higher `` ambient level '' of @xmath0 for the underlying event can be related to the presence of additional ( softer and unresolved ) parton scatterings that accompany the observed jets .",
    "the correct description of the underlying event is therefore related to a good theoretical control of the multiplicity distribution of parton interactions .",
    "a montecarlo inplementation of multi  parton interactions based on an impact parameter picture for hadronic collisions naturally contains some of the qualitative features observed in underlying events , because events selected with a high @xmath0 jets are more likely to be central collisions , and therefore are more likely to contain additional parton scatterings .",
    "a non vanishing variance of @xmath9 should however enhance the differences between underlying and minimum bias events , and could therefore play a non negligible role in the description of the data .",
    "a quantitative study of this problem with montecarlo methods is a goal for future work .",
    "the problem of the fluctuations in the configurations of partons in a hadron is also intimately related to diffractive scattering , as we will illustrate in the following section .",
    "in the following we will need to consider also the elastic and total cross section in hadronic scattering . the elastic scattering amplitude in the collision of two hadrons of type @xmath18 and @xmath19 at c.m .",
    "energy @xmath3 can be written @xcite as a ( 2dimensional ) integral over impact parameter : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the profile function , that without loss of generality can be written as : @xmath109 with @xmath110 the eikonal function . in the notation",
    "we are leaving implicit the dependence on the type of hadrons participating in the collision .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross section by : @xmath111 in this equation @xmath112 is the squared momentum transfer , and we have used the approximation @xmath113 that is valid for small @xmath114 and high energy . integrating over all @xmath75 one obtains : @xmath115 the total cross section is related to the imaginary part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude by the optical theorem and is given by : @xmath116 =   2 \\;\\int d^2b ~ \\re \\left [ \\gamma_{\\rm el } ( b , s ) \\right ]   \\label{eq : siggen_tot}\\ ] ] combining equations ( [ eq : siggen_el ] ) and ( [ eq : siggen_tot ] ) one obtains an expression for the inelastic cross section as an integral over the impact parameter : @xmath117    equation ( [ eq : gen_dsig ] ) gives the exact shape of the differential elastic cross section . for small @xmath118",
    "this shape is to a good approximation a simple exponential ( @xmath119 ) and it is convenient to define the slope @xmath120 of elastic scattering : @xmath121_{t=0}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to see that if the profile function is real , the slope @xmath120 can be calculated as : @xmath122 and measures the value @xmath123 , of the profile function .",
    "using the approximate exponential shape of the differential cross section one finds the relation @xmath124 \\right ) ^2   ~\\left | i + \\rho \\right |^2}{b_{\\rm el}(s)}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath125 is the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward elastic amplitude ) . from the optical theorem ( [ eq : siggen_tot ] )",
    "one obtains the relation : @xmath126      the expressions ( [ eq : gen_ampl][eq : siggen_inel ] ) allow to compute the total and elastic cross sections for hadron collisions in terms of the profile function @xmath127 or equivalently of the eikonal function @xmath110 .",
    "we remain with the task of constructing these functions .",
    "physical insight on @xmath108 and @xmath110 can be obtained using a well known analogy with the classical treatment of the absorption and scattering of a plane wave of light from an opaque screen . if the ratio between the amplitude `` just behind '' the screen and the amplitude of the incident plane wave is @xmath128 ( where @xmath76 is a 2dimensional vector spanning the screen ) , then it is simple to obtain expressions for the total , elastic and absorption cross sections that are formally identical to equations ( [ eq : gen_ampl][eq : siggen_inel ] ) .",
    "in particular the expression ( [ eq : siggen_inel ] ) for the inelastic cross section suggests to interpret the quantity @xmath129 as the probability to absorb the wave at the position @xmath76 on the screen .    at high energy the elastic scattering amplitude , in reasonably good approximation ,",
    "is purely imaginary , and accordingly the profile and eikonal functions are purely real . neglecting the real part of the scattering amplitude the optical analogy is then sufficient to express the profile function as : @xmath130 with @xmath131 the absorption probability .    in the following",
    "we will use the approximation to consider the elastic scattering amplitude as purely imaginary , and the profile and eikonal functions as purely real .",
    "the analiticity of the elastic scattering amplitude that is necessary to respect causality , can be imposed estimating the real part with a dispersion relation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) can be re  expressed in the form : @xmath132 \\label{eq : ansatz1}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath133 is the probability of _ no _ absorption in a collision at a certain @xmath2 and @xmath134 .",
    "the notation @xmath135 is motivated by the physical ansatz that `` absorption '' in a hadron collision corresponds to at least one interaction between the parton constituents of the two hadrons . if @xmath1 is the expected number of _ all _ elementary interactions between partons , and if the fluctuations of this average number of interactions is poissonian , one obtains equation ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) for the profile and eikonal function .",
    "the ansatz outlined above connects the profile function @xmath136 to @xmath69 that is the average number of elementary interactions at impact parameter @xmath2 and c.m .",
    "energy @xmath3 . in the following",
    "we will call this model as the `` simple eikonal model '' .",
    "this ansatz was introduced by durand and pi in @xcite , who proposed to compute the quantity @xmath1 as : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the quantity discussed in the previous section , that is the inclusive cross section for the production of jet pairs above a certain ( fixed ) @xmath0 , and the energy independent geometry factor @xmath71 gives the overlap of hadronic matter . for @xmath10 interactions durand and pi ( see discussion in appendix  [ sec : overlap ] ) chose : @xmath139 with @xmath140  gev@xmath141 .    the model in this simplest form ( that has in fact a single parameter , the value of @xmath12 ) soon proved to be inconsistent with the data .",
    "perhaps the main difficulty with the original formulation of the model is that it predicts an incorrect relation between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "this problem in fact is of a general nature and indicates that in the simple eikonal model , the factorization of @xmath144 as the product of two functions one of @xmath134 and the other of @xmath2 can not fit the data .    to falsify the factorization hypothesis ( [ eq : factorization1 ] ) it is in fact sufficient to measure both @xmath145 and the slope of elastic scattering @xmath120 ( or more in general , because of equation ( [ eq : unit1 ] ) and the smallness of @xmath125 , two out of the three quantities @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath120 ) at two different values of @xmath3 .",

    "we will indicate as `` diffraction '' the sum of these three classes of inelastic diffractive events .",
    "we take the point of view that any parton ",
    "parton scattering implies an exchange of color , and therefore , in the treatment of the cross section given above , all events with one or more parton ",

    "the problem with the approach that we have just outlined , is that it is only formal , and requires the introduction of many , in fact infinite parameters ; moreover the nature of the eigenstates @xmath203 is not physically obvious .",

    "they also include a simple explicit methods to construct these partonic models ( see @xcite for a recent rediscussion ) .",
    "in this work we will develop the idea that one needs to integrate over the parton configurations of the interacting hadron .",

    "the first is that ( as we have already discussed in section  [ sec : parameters ] ) the values of @xmath321 needed to describe the experimental data in a model that includes diffraction are significantly larger than estimates based on the simple eikonal model , the second is that the growth of @xmath161 with c.m . energy is significantly more rapid .",

    "the motivation for the functional form of this fit ( that should however also be considered as purely phenomenological ) is that integrating above an energy independent @xmath12 , the jet cross section @xmath353 ( see equation ( [ eq : jet2a ] ) ) has qualitatively the behaviour : @xmath354 where @xmath355 , and the quantity @xmath356 is related to the behaviour of the pdf s for @xmath357 : @xmath358 the behaviour ( [ eq : asymp ] ) can be easily be obtained from the convolution of pdf s with the asymptotic form ( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) .",
