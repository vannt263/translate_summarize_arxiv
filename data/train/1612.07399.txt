    "the supernova of 1604 was observed by johannes kepler and other astronomers in europe , korea , and china .",
    "not so many years before , the supernova sn1572 , currently named tycho s supernova , was the subject of extensive studies , both astronomical and philosophical , by tycho brahe ( brahe 1603 ) .",
    "the supernova in 1604 inspired as well observational measurements and philosophical considerations by kepler .",
    "the philosophical disquisitions were on the nature of the heavens .",
    "the idea of crystal spheres carrying each one a planet , and rolling over one another , had already been shattered by the discovery of sn 1572 .",
    "the possibility of a heaven that gives birth to natural objects grew along the following years , and was reenhanced by the discovery of the supernova of 1604 .",
    "kepler wrote his reflections in a book called _ de stella nova in pede serpentariis _ ( 1606 ) .",
    "the collection of his observational records on sn 1604 and those of colleagues are found mostly in his compendium _ gesammelte werke _ ( collection of kepler s works made in 1938 ) .    because of the importance of kepler as a physicist , and of the records collected by him from sn 1604 , this supernova is often called kepler s supernova .    for many years , it was not clear which type of supernova it was .",
    "there were discussions on whether it was a core ",
    "collapse supernova or a thermonuclear one .",
    "x  ray studies have shown that the o / fe ratio in the remnant of sn 1604 corresponds to that of a type ia supernova ( reynolds et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this supernova remnant",
    ", there are signs that the system might have been relatively massive , one of its components creating a detached circumstellar shell ( csm ) of 1 m@xmath3 expanding into the interstellar medium ( vink 2008 ) .",
    "recent studies of this cms suggest that it had lost contact with the inner evolving stars years before the explosion ( katsuda et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in agreement with the abovementioned ,",
    "some authors have suggested that the companion star could have been an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star that had lost its envelope ( chiotellis et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "all the discussions concerning the progenitor of kepler supernova are haunted by the lack of precision in the estimated distance .",
    "the supernova is located well above the galactic plane , at l@xmath4 4.5@xmath5 , b@xmath46.4@xmath5 ( vink 2008 ) .",
    "it has an angular size of 2 arcmin .",
    "the suggested distances to the remnant lies between 3 and 7 kpc .",
    "one of the first distances were obtained by reynoso and goss ( 1999 ) , using the h i absorption to the remnant to give a constraint of 4.8 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 6.2 kpc . the first distance given by sankrit et al ( 2005 ) , using the proper motion of the optical filaments , had a value of 3.9@xmath8 kpc .",
    "vink ( 2008 ) gave a distance @xmath9 6 kpc , from arguments related to the velocity of the forward shock .",
    "based on the non  detection of tev gamma ",
    "rays by hess , aharonian et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested a distance of @xmath10 6 kpc .",
    "most recently , sankrit et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have revisited the method based on the proper motion of the filaments to derive as distance 5.1@xmath11 kpc .    in the present work ,",
    "we go back to the method , previously used for understanding tycho supernova in nowadays cosmological terms ( ruiz  lapuente 2004 ) , and we make use of the historical records of sn 1604 to reconstruct its light curve .",
    "we determine the best stretch of the light curve and the distance to the remnant .    knowing the distance to the supernova is crucial in the searches from a possible surviving companion in this supernova ( kerzendorf et al .",
    "2014 ; ruiz  lapuente 2014 ) .",
    "this knowledge allows to place luminosity limits to the searches and inform with accuracy of the kind of potential companions surveyed .",
    "we have compared the historical records gathered by european and korean astronomers at the time of the explosion in 1604 with the family of sne ia as known today .",
    "the supernova occurred in a region of the sky which was often observed , because the supernova appeared 3 degrees to the northwest of mars and jupiter , which were in conjunction , and about 4 degrees to the east of saturn .",
    "so , there were plenty of observations that allowed to place the time of the appearence of the supernova at october 10 , being unseen before .",
    "the early light curve is very complete , with daily reports on the brightness of the supernova .",
    "the discovery preceded by 20 days the visual maximum .",
    "this means that we have data for three weeks , a lapse which compares well with the best follow ",
    "ups currently done on early discovered supernovae .",
    "but , unlike tycho s sn which was circumpolar , sn 1604 was observed from europe and korea at relative low latitude , and during the months of november and december , the supernova was not observable during the night .",
    "the most recent reconstruction of the historical records has been made by clark and stephenson ( 1977 ) , who compare the records obtained by korean astronomers with those obtained by the european astronomers , previously examined by baade ( 1943 ) .",
    "the comparison between the korean and european records gives a good agreement in the early part of the light curve , before and around maximum , with some disagreement in the phase after maximum .",
    "the high surveillance of the supernova in epochs before its maximum ( the visual maximum was on nov 1 , according to the fit to the light curve ) was done in europe by a group of anonymous observers . only on oct 17",
    "kepler had a chance to see the supernova .",
    "we assign 0.5 mag to the individual magnitude errors in these premaximum observation as they were mostly done by untrained observers .    concerning the records after maximum , they are often single records and sometimes by untrained observers .",
    "tycho brahe s observations of the supernova of 1572 showed that the danish astronomer achieved the maximum accuracy of the human eye and was able to distinguish changes in brightness at a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "therefore , we could assign 0.25 mag and even 0.2 mag to some of his observations .",
    "johannes kepler , the magnificient imperial mathematician who followed tycho brahe in ths court of prague , would bring physics to a modern era , when the laws of motion of the planets discovered by him were explained by isaac newton .",
    "he took interest in the supernova sn 1604 , but his contribution can not be compared with his explanation of the orbit of mars .",
    "kepler used glasses as he was shortsighted .",
    "he had difficulties in differentiating the brightnesses differing by 0.25 magnitudes or more .",
    "cs77 found the comment by kepler in _ de stella nova _ that `` the star it was seen with almost the same magnitude during the whole month of october '' . kepler started to see the `` nova '' on oct 17 , but until nov 1st it had an increase in magnitude by more than 0.3 mag .",
    "kepler also wrote on feb 6 `` i left the observatory , not sure whether i had seen any trace of the star .",
    "therefore , it seems to have become too small to be seen even in this clear morning , if it has survived '' ( see cs77 , p.199 ) .",
    "the other records are from untrained astronomers . it would have benefitted the reconstruction of the light curve of sn 1604 that the observations by fabricius had been preserved , as he was known to be an accurate astronomer .",
    "baade ( 1943 ) was only able to recover some mention to these observations in kepler s collected works .",
    "thus , in general , we judge that the error in the european observations after maximum can be of 0.5 mag .    the descriptions of the brightness of sn 1604 written by the korean astronomers are simple and the colors that they gave at premaximum are at odds with those of the european astronomers .",
    "thus , we assign 0.5 mag uncertainty to the values derived for the brightness , the same error bar as for the premaximum values by european observers .    from both the early and the total light curve , it can be excluded that kepler snia were a subluminous sn 1991bg  like event .",
    "the european records have a late slope declining more slowly than a sn 1991bg - like snia .",
    "however , it does not look either as an overluminous sn 1991t  like one .",
    "the best agreement would be with something of the type of a `` normal '' snia ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "sn ia are not standard candles but calibrated ones .",
    "there is a well  known correlation between the brightness at peak of the light curve and its rate of decline .",
    "phillips ( 1993 ) gave a first correlation in terms of a parameter @xmath12 , which is the number of magnitudes of decline of the b light curve in 15 days after maximum brightness .",
    "hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used it to calibrate the calan tololo sn ia . this way to obtain the absolute magnitude of a snia in relation to the hubble constant did also include a correction for the extinction suffered by the supernova due to dust , mostly in the host galaxy .    the early way to calibrate sne ia treated separately the correction from stretch ( this one including the intrinsic color of a given snia of a particular stretch ) and the extinction by dust .",
    "later on , tripp ( 1998 ) advocated for the use of two simultaneous determinations of the parameter of stretch and the one of color , the latter taking into account the intrinsic color of the snia and the extrinsic one due to dust .    in our present case , the extinction by dust in the galaxy is very large and it is very well known .",
    "this is why we prefer to use the early version of stretch that did not require to fit a global color term , but to estimate the extinction .",
    "the excess e(b - v ) is then estimated separately , for sn 1604 .",
    "therefore , the data on sn 1604 are compared using the stretch factor @xmath13 for the characterization of the rate of decline ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; goldhaber et al . 2001 ; nobili et al .",
    "the stretch factor @xmath0 method , used by the supernova cosmology project , quantifies the decline rate of the supernova from data extending up to 60 days after maximum . in the absence of a mesurement of the brightness at maximum , the method allows to locate the event within the family of light curves of sne ia .",
    "the best agreement of the light curve of sn 1604 is with a supernova of @xmath14 0.9 ( @xmath15 ) . in this sense , as in the case of sn 1572 , we show a comparison in figure 1 with the normal supernova sn 1996x , which has an @xmath0 of 0.889 . also for comparison",
    ", we show the template light curve of a sn ia with @xmath16 , a subluminous 91bg - type , and the template of a @xmath17 sn ia like the overluminous sn 1991 t .",
    "this figure is centered on the early light curve .    comparing the historical records with a stretch @xmath18 supernova template , we obtain a @xmath19 for 13 degrees of freedom , that gives a reduced @xmath20 of 1.02 , which is a good fit .",
    "in contrast , the fit to the template of a fast  declining , underluminous snia like sn 1991bg , of stretch @xmath21 , has a @xmath22 of 21.65 for 7 degrees of freedom , that is a @xmath20 of 3.09 . in the other extreme , the fit to the template of a slowly  declining , overluminous snia , like sn 1991 t ( @xmath23 ) is the worst one , with a @xmath22 of 60.30 for 13 degrees of freedom , which gives a reduced @xmath20 of 4.64 .    , with an overlumious and slow",
    " declining @xmath17 snia ; and with an underluminous and fast declining @xmath16 snia . ]",
    "if one compares the magnitudes attributed by baade and those attributed by clark and stephenson ( 1977 ) along the post  maximum decline , one often finds that baade ( 1943 ) substracts 0.2 magnitudes to what would have been the right magnitude assignment .",
    "so , the european magnitudes in cs77 are a bit different from those of baade ( 1943 ) , and brighter . examples of this are the records of april and august .",
    "when the recorded comparison says that the star is as bright as @xmath24 oph , which has a visual magnitude of 2.43 , baade assigns to the record 2.6 .",
    "cs77 assign 2.40 in one ocassion ( april 21 ) , but in another one they judge the magnitude to be 2.25 ( april 12 ) .",
    "when the last written records say that the star is as bright as @xmath25 oph , which is 4.39 magnitudes in v , baade ( 1943 ) rounds the number to 4.5 , and clark and stephenson ( 1977 ) give 4.45 .",
    "the two last records are similar in baade ( 1943 ) and in cs77 , with only a 0.1 magnitude difference in the assigned brightness of the supernova .",
    "baade ( 1943 ) assigns to the record `` fainter than @xmath25 oph '' , 5 and 4.8 in visual magnitude , whereas cs77 assign 4.95 and 4.7 .",
    "therefore , the disagreement is not significant .",
    "however it shows a lack of complete agreement and it suggests that we should assign an error of 0.5 magnitudes to the records .",
    "cs77 located a few postmaximum data in the light curves reported by the korean astronomers .",
    "they plot huge error bars for those records , which come from the mean of several observations in every case .",
    "these are the only points for which cs77 have reported error bars .",
    "we assign errors of 0.7 magnitudes to these data .    in figure 2",
    ", we show the supernova light curve compared with those of sn 1996x , sn 1991 t and sn 1991bg .",
    "the european records at postmaximum are decisive in classifying sn 1604 as a normal snia , specially the last four .",
    "a comparison of the light curve of sn 1991bg with that of sn 1604 gives a @xmath22122.48 for 21 d.o.f , this is @xmath20 5.8 .",
    "it is not acceptable .",
    "if we want o test the similarity with sn 1991 t , we get @xmath22 @xmath4 87.83 for 31 d.o.f , so @xmath20 @xmath4 2.83 .",
    "a comparison of the light curve o sn 1996x and sn 1604 gives a @xmath22 40.507 for 30 degrees of freedom , so @xmath26 1.35 , which seems acceptable .",
    "after 100 days , the rate of decline is 1.37 @xmath1 0.12 v magnitudes in 100 days , according to baade ( 1943 ) .",
    "this also places the light curve decline amongs those of normal sne ia , which have decline rates of 1.351.5 magnitudes in 100 days ( see declines for 1990n , sn 1999bu ; for references , ruiz ",
    "lapuente 2004 ) .",
    "sne ia that interact heavily with the circumstellar medium have been named sne ia  cms .",
    "they are charactherized by a narrow h@xmath27 line on top of an overluminous spectrum .",
    "they have much more luminous and flat declines than 91t  like sne ia ( silverman et al .",
    "2013 ) .    sne ia ",
    "cms ( only 0.11 @xmath28 of all sne ia ) were discovered by hamuy et al ( 2003 ) , in sn 2002ic , which suggested that this supernova could have arised from a binary system containing a c+o white dwarf plus a massive ( 37 m@xmath3 ) agb star , where the total mass loss in h can reach a few solar masses .",
    "another well discussed snia ",
    "cms is ptf11kx , observed by dilday et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who suggested that it came from a symbiotic nova progenitor .",
    "soker et al .",
    "( 2013 ) noted , however , that the mass around ptf11kx is too high to have been produced by a recurrent nova , and suggested a violent prompt merger of a white dwarf with the core of a massive agb star .",
    "katsuda et al .",
    "( 2015 ) find that kepler sn , unlike snia ",
    "cms , should have a dense / knotty cms located far away from the progenitor star .",
    "they discuss that the cms knots were already @xmath9 2 pc away from the progenitor star at the time of the sn explosion .",
    "they also add as evidence that the interactions between the cms and the blast wave started @xmath29 200 yrs after the explosion , and the third piece of evidence is the difference between the historical light curve of kepler and the light curves of snia - cms .    in the paper of katsuda et al.(2015 ) , it is argued , from the amount of fe found in the x  ray spectrum of the supernova , that it should have syhthesized around 1 m@xmath3 of ni .",
    "we wonder whether the fe found could not come from some source different from @xmath30ni decay , since the light curve does not seem to follow the path of an overluminous snia .",
    "patnaude et al . (",
    "2012 ) show that some models of sne ia with an energy output of 1.4 10@xmath31 ergs and having their ejecta interacting with a constant density ambient medium can explain the x  ray emission without making kepler supernova overluminous .",
    "kepler supernova is clearly not one of the classes of peculiar sne ia : sniax , which fall below the phillips relation being significantly fainter than the bulk of sne ia ; neither are those fast declining sne ia that unlike sne iax are not faint at maximum ( see examples and references in ruiz ",
    "lapuente 2014 ) . on the other extreme ,",
    "it is not a super  chandrasekhar supernova with an overluminous magnitude and slow rate of decline .",
    "definitevely , sn 1604 lies in the bulk of cosmological sne ia .",
    "we aim now to estimate the distance to kepler .",
    "we think that we have the elements to provide a fairly good estimate .",
    "first of all , we have the new measurements of extinction in the galaxy provided by schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) , based on comparison of predicted colour of stars with observed ones in various surveys .",
    "these authors find that the previous estimates by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 2009 ) overestimated extinction values in the milky way by 14 @xmath28 .",
    "the previous values used the infrared emission in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation foregrounds to extract a map of extinction in the galaxy .",
    "the updated value of extinction in the direction of kepler supernova by schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) is a@xmath32=2.7 .",
    "blair et al 1991 estimated from the knots in sn 1604 where h@xmath33 could not be measured accurately but h@xmath34 was detected , an excess e(b - v)=0.9 .",
    "this estimate agrees well with the fact that the supernova at the early premaximum should have had an intrinsic b - v = 0.05 while it had an excess e(b  v ) = 0.9 from the historical records .",
    "those two estimates indicate an extinction a@xmath35@xmath4 3.1 @xmath36 e(b - v ) @xmath4 2.7@xmath1 0.1 .",
    "we thus assume a@xmath372.7 @xmath1 0.1 for sn 1604 ,    concerning the absolute maximum in the visual of kepler supernova , it should be @xmath38 @xmath9 19.2 magnitudes .",
    "we have already shown that the light curve of kepler supernova gives a better fit for a normal sn ia than for an overluminous or an underluminous one .",
    "we can apply the absolute calibration for the maximum light of sn ia derived by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using the calan tololo sn ia sample .",
    "this calibration is @xmath39 .",
    "if we take 67.8 @xmath1 0.9 km s@xmath40 mpc@xmath40 as the value of @xmath41 , then the small error in @xmath41 carries a @xmath42 @xmath4 0.03 .",
    "then we take into account the error associated to the strech fit .",
    "it is carried out taking into account the uncertainty in fitting the early maximum and the factor multiplying this rate  of  decline fit .",
    "this gives a final @xmath43 @xmath9 0.2 mag .",
    "a m@xmath32@xmath4 -19.2 is actually in agreement with a previous indication obtained by modeling the late phases of normal sn ia ( ruiz  lapuente 1997 ) .",
    "the brightness of kepler snia at maximum was -3 mag , as bright as saturn .",
    "then , replacing the values in @xmath44 , we obtain @xmath2 kpc .",
    "the error in the distance corresponds to a 0.2 mag error in the estimated peak magnitude in v plus 0.1 in extinction .",
    "the nature of sn 1604 , the most recently observed galactic sn , was an object of debate since its discovery , johannes kepler being its most famous observer and the most prominent figure in the ensuing disquisitions .",
    "even when its sn nature was acknowledged , there were still discussions about its classification , either as type i or a type ii sn .",
    "this point of debate was settled some 10 years ago , by x ",
    "ray observations of the remnant . in spite of being acknowledged as a type ia , thermonuclear sn",
    ", its further classification within the sn ia family has remained unclear .",
    "we have used the historical records on sn 1604 , coming from european and korean astronomers , to reconstruct the light curve of this sn ia . that has been based on the combination of the attribution of magnitudes by baade ( 1945 ) and by clark & stevenson ( 1977 ) to the ancient records .",
    "we assign a precision according to the information about the records .",
    "the data have then been fitted with template light curves , parameterized by the stretch factor @xmath0 , the best fit corresponds to a `` normal '' sn ia , ( @xmath45 0.9 @xmath1 0.13 ) .",
    "the fit excludes both overluminous events like sn 1991 t and subluminous ones like sn 1991bg .",
    "the absolute magnitude of sn 1604 at maximum should have been @xmath46 and the error is calculated according to the error in magnitude coming from the error in stretch and in the calibration linked with h@xmath47 .",
    "it is of 0.2 magnitudes in v.      we obtain a distance to sn 1604 of @xmath49 kpc , in agreement with recent estimates based on the proper motions of the optical filaments of the remnant of the sn , but discarding suggested distances of @xmath9 6 kpc or more .",
    "that is very important for the direct search of a possible surviving companion to the sn .",
    "i would like to thank discussions on kepler s snia with keiichi maeda at the miapp on `` the physics of supernovae '' during the summer of 2016 .",
    "i am also grateful to rahman amanullah for making possible a comparison with various versions of the stretch correction .",
