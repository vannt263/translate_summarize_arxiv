    "it may be accompanied by correlated or uncorrelated isocurvature perturbations @xcite which source its evolution , or it may be generated after the end of inflation by the decay of another field @xcite .    it has recently become clear that interesting information about the particle physics that drove inflation is encoded in the non - gaussian features of the curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "although observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy constrain the spectrum of perturbations to be close to scale - invariance with very nearly gaussian statistics @xcite , some non - gaussianity is inevitable due to the universal coupling of all matter fields to gravity @xcite .",
    "the question remains , however , as to the precise level of non - gaussianity that is generated .",
    "this is sensitive to details of the inflationary model , such as the number of fields which contribute to the energy density of the universe during inflation @xcite , and also to possible non - canonical structures in the scalar field lagrangian @xcite .",

    "a breakdown of this rule for any @xmath6 indicates a departure from gaussianity .",
    "since some higher - order correlations may be more easily detectable @xcite than others , it is important to quantify the theoretical predictions for as many values of @xmath3 as possible . to date , the majority of quantitative theoretical studies have focused on the three - point function , or equivalently the ` bispectrum ' @xmath7 , @xmath8 precise gaussianity corresponds to @xmath9 . in practise ,",

    "one can not trust to give the dominant contribution to @xmath55 , but it is consistent with the explicit momentum dependence in , which approaches zero in the formal limit where any @xmath229 .",

    "taken together with the explicit family of equilateral configurations , which are all allowed by momentum conservation , this removes any worry that the complicated expression obtained for @xmath55 in eq .",

    "a number of simplifications arise when the analysis is restricted to single - field inflation and we proceed to discuss these in the following section .",

    "represents the largest possible non - gaussian signal which can be visible in the trispectrum .",
    "we conclude that it is too small ever to be detected .",
    "a second special feature of single - field inflation is the existence of a consistency relation between the correlators @xmath256 . in the ` squeezed ' limit , where @xmath257 , the @xmath258 mode crosses the horizon at a much earlier epoch than the remaining modes @xmath259 . by the time these modes eventually exit the horizon , the gravitational background has been deformed due to the presence of the @xmath258 mode .",
    "as first pointed out by maldacena @xcite , the @xmath192 mode and the @xmath260 modes no longer interfere when they cross the horizon , which implies that the only correlation between them is the one imposed by this gravitational relationship . in the case of the three - point function , this yields the relation @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the spectral index of the scalar perturbation power spectrum .",
    "it was later emphasized by creminelli & zaldarriaga @xcite that the limit   is purely kinematical and applies for any metric theory of gravity .",
    "this implies that it can be calculated on the basis of gravitational physics alone @xcite .",
    "maldacena s arguments apply for any correlation function of @xmath2 , including the four - point function . in this case , the consistency relationship is given by @xmath263    to gain further insight into the nature of eq .",
    ", it is instructive to count powers of slow - roll . in general , the derivatives of the number of e - foldings , @xmath45 , are controlled by the slow - roll parameter @xmath264 . if @xmath265 is almost constant over the range of e - folds under consideration , it follows that @xmath266 .",
    "this implies that each derivative of @xmath45 with respect to the scalar field generates an extra power of @xmath267 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 , etc . by counting powers of slow - roll in eq .",

    "therefore , the leading slow - roll term in the four - point function of @xmath2 will be given by possible subdominant corrections to which do not vanish in the squeezed limit , together with the terms which contribute to the four - point function at _ next_-order in the slow - roll parameter @xmath265 , _ i.e. _ , the terms of order @xmath271 .",

    "the momentum conservation condition implies that one - half of the permuations are equal to the other half , giving twelve distinct terms .",

    "@xcite in the context of the curvaton scenario .    in principle , therefore , the next - order contribution to the four - point function can be obtained by summing eqs .",
    ". however , when performing such a sum , self - consistency would require that the next - order versions of the two- and three - point functions of the field fluctuations @xmath277 and the derivatives of @xmath45 be employed .",
    "to date , the required expressions for these quantities have yet to be calculated since presumably they are unobservably small .",
    "consequently , we should not expect the @xmath265 and @xmath170 dependence of eqs .",
    " to match the right - hand side of eq .  , where @xmath278 is @xmath228 in the slow - roll expansion",
    "on the other hand , the next - order corrections to the scale factor , @xmath279 , the wavefunctions of the @xmath48 and the third - order action are not expected to contain any _ intrinsically _ second- or higher - order slow - roll parameters , which involve the third- or higher - derivatives of the potential .",
    "therefore , summing eqs .   with the leading - order expressions for @xmath45 , the scale factor @xmath280 , and the two- and three - point functions of the field flucations @xmath277 should match the coefficient of @xmath281 in eq .  .",
    "we have verified that this is the case .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation imprinted at horizon crossing during inflation . in particular , we have estimated the expected magnitude of the non - linearity parameter , @xmath20 , which is generated by this process .",
    "we find that it is bounded by about @xmath282 , and therefore is too small to be observable by the planck satellite or other future cmb experiments . in single - field models , @xmath2 is conserved to all orders on superhorizon scales .",
    "therefore , no subsequent generation of non - gaussianity is possible , and the primordial signal will be too small ever to be detected .",
    "one unexpected feature of the four - point action is that it contains no powers of slow - roll parameters . in an earlier publication @xcite",
    ", two of us ( ds and jel ) suggested that the @xmath3th order action would contain essentially @xmath283 powers of @xmath284 , which would imply that the coupling to the spacetime metric ( and all backreaction from it ) switches off order - by - order in the limit @xmath285 , and therefore that the field fluctuations are purely gaussian in the de sitter limit .",
    "our result for @xmath55 shows that this does _ not _ happen : the scalar fields and the metric remain coupled even in exact de sitter space , and the fluctuations are therefore non - gaussian .",
    "intuitively , this occurs because the size of the non - gaussianities in the @xmath48 is controlled by the strength of the gravitational interaction , rather than @xmath284 , even though powers of slow - roll appear once one has changed variable to the comoving curvature perturbation , @xmath2 .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath2 is not an appropriate choice of variable to discuss the limit @xmath285 , since it becomes singular there .    in the case of single - field inflation , we have applied maldacena s consistency argument to the trispectrum . for the first time , this has employed the _",
    "third_-order term in the expansion of @xmath28 in terms of initial field values . only the linear and quadratic terms in the expansion",
    "have previously been required . in the case of the trispectrum ,",
    "the consistency relationship arises as a next - order effect in the slow - roll parameter @xmath265 , in contrast to that of the bispectrum .",
    "we have also derived expressions in the spatially flat gauge for the second - order metric perturbation sourced by multiple scalar fields .",
    "these expressions show explicitly that a metric perturbation continues to exist at this order even when the background is pure de sitter space , corresponding to @xmath286 . at first - order",
