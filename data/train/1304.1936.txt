    "the key characteristics of a working biomolecular system is an enormous richness of structural complexity and a robust working principle , molecular recognition , for identifying geometries that optimize the intermolecular binding and alignment .",
    "stronger covalent or ionic binding determines the structure inside the molecules and provides resilience towards statistical fluctuations.@xcite this permanence is , for example , of utmost importance in the preservation of the information contained in our deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) genome.@xcite the binding that is of relevance for life processes , e.g. , the molecular - recognition matching@xcite of genes , is weaker to allow the reversible operations that nature needs.@xcite the molecular recognition arises as a delicate balance between steric hindrance , electrostatics , and van der waals ( vdw ) attraction , the latter also termed the london dispersion interaction .",
    "the search for a deeper understanding of such biomolecular operation motivates development of a parameter - free computational theory that both provides transferability and computational efficiency.@xcite the structural complexity of the biomolecular systems implies that the supramolecular system may express itself in a multitude of ways , and it is not certain that a given empirical ( or semi - empirical ) interaction model remains applicable for all emerging configurations and for varying charging states .    density functional theory ( dft ) is a highly valued condensed - matter theory tool that is our work horse in predictive computational theory of traditional materials problems.@xcite in such systems , the electron density remains high between the atoms , for example , in a bulk structure .",
    "dft also works excellently for individual molecules but it has until recently lacked an account of the truly nonlocal correlations that underpin vdw interactions between constituents in a molecular system .",
    "the issue is that molecular systems are inherently sparse:@xcite they must also contain low electron - density regions between the molecular fragments .",
    "the sparseness is even the defining quality when nature puts molecular recognition to work among biomolecules .",
    "nevertheless , the last decade have seen developments that position dft to overcome this previous limitation .    the vdw density functional ( vdw - df ) method@xcite has a track record@xcite as a general - purpose nonempirical dft that can characterize interactions in sparse and soft biomolecular systems .",
    "the vdw - df method accounts for vdw interactions by introducing true nonlocality in the density functional .",
    "being built as a physics - based description and within a constraint - based design , it has the electron - based description that helps transferability .",
    "this is , for example , important for systems where it is essential to describe the vdw binding or attraction for several typical separations.@xcite this is true even if the plasmon - type description may not capture the full complexity in the description of the far - apart - regime for some systems that effectively behave as a low - dimensional metal.@xcite there exist efficient implementations also for self - consistent evaluations .",
    "one such algorithm@xcite uses a fast fourier transform approach which accelerates evaluation for medium - to - large size systems while real - space evaluation approaches@xcite may hold advantages for very - large - scaled systems , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "this paper reports that a nonempirical vdw - df characterization of the variation in the vdw attraction among biopolymers is indeed feasible . in vdw - df , this vdw attraction is reflected in a nonlocal correlation term @xmath1 .",
    "other terms , including a single - particle kinetic energy term @xmath2 and the semilocal parts of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath3 also contribute to the vdw - df total energy @xmath4 but ( for objects that are effectively neutral ) it is the vdw attraction , contained in @xmath1 , that dominates when the density overlap between fragments can be ignored .",
    "our vdw - df characterization presented here thus computes the @xmath1 variation to map the morphology dependence in the vdw attraction between a pair of parallel , infinitely - repeated double - stranded ( ds ) dna helices .",
    "we find that the vdw interaction of such dna dimer is sensitive to the alignment of the major dna structural motifs , particularly different orientations of the major and minor grooves of the two ds - dna macromolecules .",
    "we also identify and discuss a set of systematic changes that arise in the vdw attraction when the problem is investigated across a range of interaction distances.@xcite we further compare the @xmath1 variation to the evaluation of the semiempirical vdw term of a vdw - extended dft method,@xcite namely dft - d2.@xcite we use and extend analytical interaction results@xcite that apply for the far ( but not asymptotically far ) regime , to illustrate the difference in nature between our electron - based vdw - df study and the atom - based dft - d approach .",
    "moreover , we contrast this interpretation of the vdw attraction in a dna dimer with corresponding results for a dimer of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) .    with this study",
    "we propose a vdw - df computational strategy for large - biomolecules , the strategy _ begins _ non - empirical studies of the interactions by a mapping of the vdw - attraction term @xmath1 .",
    "this is suggested to optimize computational efficiency .",
    "we observe that the @xmath1 mapping of vdw attraction can today be carried out at the cost of about ten wall time minutes per dna dimer interaction geometry .",
    "that is much smaller than the time it takes to evaluate the variation in the kinetic energy @xmath2 because of an excellent scaling of real - space evaluations of @xmath1 , ref .  .",
    "the cost of computing @xmath2 through wavefunctions is the same for dft - d and vdw - df so our suggested strategy could also be relevant , for example , for large - system dft - d studies.@xcite the motivation for our proposal is that a complete nonempirical vdw - df evaluation can be focused on the relevant interaction morphologies that the @xmath1 mapping identifies .",
    "the possibilities for using an adapted harris scheme@xcite to accelerate the complete vdw - df evaluation is discussed and assessed in a closely related publication , ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the ds - dna and dna dimer systems are described and discussed in section ii , which also introduces the particular cnt structure investigated here . in section iii we present the computational method used . section iv consists of a study of the nonlocal correlation energy variation as the distance between the dnas is changed and the two structures are rotated",
    ". it also contains comparisons of our vdw - df - based results in the far ( nearly asymptotic ) region to the dispersion interaction predicted by dft - d2,@xcite and with results of similar studies for cnts .",
    "the primary structure of dna is made up by four different nucleobases , the adenine ( a ) , guanine ( g ) , cytosine ( c ) and thymine ( t ) bases , each covalently linked to a sugar .",
    "these building blocks are joined to a strand by phosphate groups connecting the sugars .",
    "the two dna strands form a double helix with ( predominantly ) hydrogen bonds linking base pairs , thus forming the dna secondary structure . the repeated pairing between a purine base ( a or g ) and a smaller pyrimidine ( t or c ) produces a constant diameter for the double helix .",
    "along - axis and side views of a minimal repeat - unit cell model of the ds - dna macromolecule .",
    "the atoms are p ( yellow ) , o ( dark red ) , h ( cyan ) , n ( blue ) , and c ( gray ) .",
    "figure created using xcrysden.@xcite , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    one of us was previously involved in a vdw - df study of the nucleobases , focusing on the stacking interactions.@xcite even if the vdw forces by themselves may have limited selectivity ( for small molecules like base pairs ) , the vdw forces are essential in the building of this secondary structure because they drive , optimize , and hold a structural assembly until more stable bonds can be formed .",
    "this mechanism is fundamental in the case of molecular recognition and in dna replication .",
    "the previous study@xcite provides vdw - df analysis and results for the rise and twist of the base pairs inside ( that is , between the backbones of ) the ds - dna structure .",
    "the nonlocal correlation contribution @xmath1 to vdw - df will by itself have difficulties in aligning small molecules but the vdw forces still position these components ( base pairs ) close enough that the corrugation from kinetic - energy repulsion is expressed . the previous vdw - df study@xcite reported a very good agreement between vdw - df characterizations and experimental information ( for example , correlations in base - pair rotation angles as extracted from the nucleic acid database@xcite ) .",
    "this progress highlights possibilities of a broader application of the vdw - df method to soft matter challenges and in particular to refine the description of the vdw attraction between biopolymers .",
    "we focus our large - scale vdw - df interaction study on dimers of a ds - dna model structure in the b - form .",
    "both ds - dna fragments are assumed to have the periodically repeated sequence of nucleobases gcaatacggt .",
    "the ds - dna atomic structure is built from idealized coordinates.@xcite in our model the axes of the two ds - b - dna fragments are straight and parallel to each other .    figure [ fig : x1 ] shows the atomic positions in the minimal - repeat unit cell for one ds - b - dna molecule . on the most coarse level",
    "it reflects a cylinder - like form for dna but it also shows both major and minor grooves of the double helix .",
    "this dna model contains 635 atoms and is limited to one coil , but it is periodic and is used as the repeat unit cell of a dft calculation so that the dna is still described as a macromolecular system ( through the infinite repetition of the unit cell along the dna axis ) .",
    "the polar sugar - phosphate strand on the external part of the chain can form favorable interactions with ions in a solvent .",
    "each phosphate group then carries a negative charge which is balanced by positive ions , the counter ions , in the surrounding liquid . the counter ions stabilize the structure , making the dna - ion system charge neutral .",
    "correlation between the concentrations in the counter ions may themselves contribute further to an attraction between the dna - ion system and another organic molecule",
    ". however , we shall not consider such effects here .",
    "instead we investigate the vdw binding arising from nonlocal electron correlation effects between two ds - dna structures assuming ( and enforcing in our dft calculations ) that the dna repeated - unit cell model structure itself remains charge neutral .",
    "a forthcoming study addresses the effects on the vdw attraction of the charging by counter ions .",
    "the double - helix structure is very regular , and when viewed along the axis appears almost isotropic ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] ) .",
    "this average isotropy of dna simplifies our study of the sensitivity of the vdw binding to macromolecular structural motifs .",
    "the average isotropy also helps in the comparison with cnt dimer interactions as we can define an approximate  radius \" of dna .",
    "we can thus compare the vdw interactions as a function of wall - to - wall distances @xmath5 in dimers of dna and dimers of cnt , using the analysis of refs .  .",
    "for dna we use the radius that is defined as the average of the helix backbone p and o atoms distances from the dna center ( 8.5  and 9.7  ) .",
    "this yields the approximate dna radius @xmath6 9.1  ( shown by a double - arrow line in figure [ fig : x1 ] ) , close to that of the standard literature description where the diameter is taken to be @xmath7  . for a given center - to - center separation @xmath8 of the dna dimer structure",
    "we thus use @xmath9 as the wall - to - wall separation of the dna dimer .    the approximate similarity of dna with the cylinder form of a cnt represents one major structural motif of the structure .",
    "another major structural motif is obviously the existence of grooves ( right panel ) , a feature which is distinctly different from what characterizes the cnts .",
    "the systems studied here are sparse@xcite so that the vdw interaction ( with electrostatics ) dominates in the intermolecular regions of low electron density . by basing the function on weaker forces",
    ", nature ensures a truly remarkable resilience of our genetic code.@xcite     left : example of a system obtained starting from a single 33.8  period of the ds - dna that is copied , translated and rotated inside an enlarged unit cell .",

    "dft calculations of interacting systems are effectively limited by the computational challenge of accurately calculating the kinetic energy , a step which requires solving the noninteracting particle schrdinger equation in three dimensions .",
    "one could fear that the nonlocal nature of the correlations that define the dispersive forces , i.e. , the vdw - df evaluation of the @xmath1 , may also represent a computational challenge for large systems . however , efficient algorithms are now in place and there are , effectively , no other computational bottlenecks for biomolecular vdw - df and/or dft - d studies , like those presented here , than the evaluation of the ( noninteracting ) kinetic energy @xmath2 .",
    "we note that since @xmath1 is far less costly ( for large systems ) than any calculation of eigenstates , it is wise to _ begin _ a first - principle biomolecular interaction study by mapping out the @xmath1 variation ; this saves the costly determination of the kinetic - energy repulsion to relevant interaction morphologies . here",

    "we ascribe these differences to the vdw - df ability to include multipole and some collectivity effects through its plasmon - pole description@xcite and its emphasis on reflecting the electron - density variation.@xcite      we note that at distances @xmath68  it is also important to include the remaining components of the vdw - df method , see ref .  .    in a closely related study@xcite",
    "we assess the possibility of using an adaption of the harris scheme@xcite to accelerate the evaluation also of the remaining vdw - df ( or dft - d ) components , predominantly seeking to bypass repeated evaluations of the kinetic energy variation @xmath2 .",
    "this study shows that a high degree of accuracy can be achieved .",
    "a forthcoming paper will report the results for the dna dimer problem and will detail effects that the dna charging state might have on the vdw attraction .",
    "in this paper , we show that the vdw - df functional has the potential to describe extended systems with the accuracy of dft , thus opening a way to the description of complex soft phenomena .",
    "we find that our computational strategy for first - principle vdw - df characterization ( with our moderate - level access to hpc ) can give some qualitative and even semi - quantitative results for biomolecular systems even before the full vdw - df ( or for example dft - d ) evaluation of the kinetic - energy repulsion effects is completed .",
    "an accelerated vdw - df computational framework@xcite study can be expected to work well for investigations of vdw bound systems . here",
    ", we have illustrated the possibility of an even faster initial mapping by evaluating the vdw - binding component .",
    "an additional component in the strategy is to adapt the ideas of the harris scheme as explored in a parallel study.@xcite the motivation such strategy is easily stated : even if our dna model structure is only a model system of the full secondary genome structure , the individual ds - dna still contains 635 atoms and the dimer system contains 1270 atoms .",
    "the size of the problem prevents us ( at the supercomputing facilities to which we have access ) from performing an ordinary potential - energy calculation by means of a conventional dft implementation .",
    "more realistic studies will contain even more atoms per unit cell , or have other similar complications .",
    "thus any computational simplification able to keep most of the original accuracy is welcome .",
    "that observation is true whether or not we wish to pursue a vdw - df or a dft - d study .    the nonlocal correlation energy @xmath1 , which contains the essential information about the vdw binding , is accessible with a limited computational effort .",
    "we have found that this @xmath1 evaluation has essentially perfect scaling up to at least 2000 cores in our real space implementation.@xcite    we are thus proposing to _ initialize _ vdw - df studies of large biomolecular interaction problems by first mapping out what interaction geometries are plausible , from knowing the variation in the vdw attraction . by beginning the vdw - df identification of optimal interaction geometries with this vdw - attraction step we are pursuing a course that is similar to that nature uses in its own molecular - recognition search .",
    "the authors thank professor jason kahn , university of maryland , for valued discussions on the atomic coordinates in a standard idealized model of structure of a ds - dna coil.@xcite we thank eskil varenius and magnus sandn for computing a corresponding ds - b - dna electron density that represents a starting point for the here - described mapping of the vdw attraction .",
    "partial support from the swedish research council ( vr ) and the chalmers area of advance materials is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the computations were performed on resources provided by the swedish national infrastructure for computing ( snic ) at c3se and nsc .",
    "with some robust assumptions it is possible to provide analytical results for the vdw interaction per length , @xmath69 , for two parallel ( infinitely repeated ) cylindrical structures when these are far , but not asymptotically far , apart.@xcite the assumptions are that the matter is continuous , a slightly simplified plasmon - pole approximation , and that the ( screened ) effective susceptibility can be approximated as having equivalent magnitudes for response along the cylinder axis and tangent",
    ". there are some differences in this analytical evaluation for hollow ( relevant for carbon nanotubes ) and filled ( relevant for dna ) cylinders but in both cases the results can be expressed in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function . for either types of interacting systems ,",
    "we consider two cylinders of equal radius @xmath61 at center - to - center distance @xmath8 .    _ for a pair of massive cylinders _ a two - variable expression is given in the book by mahanty and ninham@xcite in terms of appell s hypergeometric function @xmath70 @xmath71 here @xmath72 is a ( positive ) prefactor that reflects the susceptibility of the material in the cylinders and whose value can be set by investigating the asymptotic form .",
