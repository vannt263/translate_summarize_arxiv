    "emission lines of ti ions , including ti xix , have been widely measured in laboratory plasmas @xcite@xcite , due to their interest for the development of x - ray lasers .",
    "titanium is also often a material in the walls of fusion reactors , and hence many ionisation stages of this element are observed in fusion spectra due to the high temperatures .",
    "considering its importance , several calculations have been performed in the past @xcite@xcite to determine atomic data for energy levels , radiative rates ( a- values ) , and excitation rates or equivalently the effective collision strengths ( @xmath2 ) , which are obtained from the electron impact collision strengths ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "additionally , omahony _ et al _ @xcite have reported analytical expressions to derive values of @xmath2 for ti xix , based on @xmath4-matrix calculations for be - like ions between sc xviii and zn xxvii .",
    "however , all these data are for transitions among the lowest 10 levels of the @xmath5=2 configurations of ti xix , and no calculation has so far been performed with the @xmath4-matrix code which explicitly includes the contribution of resonances in the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the resonance contribution to @xmath2 may be highly significant , particularly for the forbidden transitions , as we will demonstrate in section 6 .",
    "therefore , in this work we report atomic data for energy levels , a- values , @xmath3 and @xmath2 for transitions among the lowest 98 levels of the @xmath0 4 configurations of ti xix .    for calculations of energy levels and a - values we employ the fully relativistic grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) code , which was originally developed by grant _",
    "et al _ @xcite and revised by dr p h norrington .",
    "it is a fully relativistic code , and is based on the @xmath6 coupling scheme .",
    "further relativistic corrections arising from the breit ( magnetic ) interaction and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects ( vacuum polarization and lamb shift ) have also been included .",
    "additionally , we have used the option of _ extended average level _ ( eal ) , in which a weighted ( proportional to 2@xmath7 + 1 ) trace of the hamiltonian matrix is minimized .",
    "this produces a compromise set of orbitals describing closely lying states with moderate accuracy . for our calculations of @xmath3",
    ", we have adopted the _",
    "dirac atomic @xmath4-matrix code _ ( darc ) of p h norrington and i p grant ( http://web.am.qub.ac.uk/darc/ ) .",
    "finally , for comparison purposes , we have performed parallel calculations with the _ flexible atomic code _",
    "( fac ) of gu @xcite , available from the website .",
    "this is also a fully relativistic code which provides a variety of atomic parameters , and ( generally ) yields results for energy levels and radiative rates comparable to grasp ",
    "see , for example , aggarwal _ et al _ @xcite . however , differences in collision strengths and subsequently in effective collision strengths with those obtained from darc can be large , particularly for forbidden transitions , as demonstrated in some of our earlier papers @xcite@xcite , and also discussed below in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "hence results from fac will be helpful in assessing the accuracy of our energy levels and radiative rates , and in estimating the contribution of resonances to the determination of effective collision strengths , included in calculations from darc but not in fac .",
    "the 17 configurations of ti xix , namely ( 1s@xmath8 ) 2@xmath92@xmath10 , 2@xmath93@xmath10 and 2@xmath94@xmath10 , give rise to the lowest 98 levels listed in table 1 , where we also provide our level energies calculated from grasp , _ without _ and _ with _ the inclusion of breit and qed effects .",
    "wiese and fuhr @xcite have compiled and critically evaluated experimentally measured energy levels of ti xix , listed at the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm .",
    "these compilations are included in table 1 for comparisons . however , nist energies are not available for many levels , particularly of the 2@xmath94@xmath10 configurations , and for some of the levels their results are indistinguishable ",
    "see for example : 26/27 [ ( 2p3p ) @xmath11d@xmath12 and @xmath13p@xmath14 and 41/42 [ 2p3d @xmath11p@xmath15 .",
    "also included in the table are our calculations obtained from the fac code ( fac1 ) , including the same ci ( configuration interaction ) as in grasp .",
    "our level energies obtained without the breit and qed effects ( grasp1 ) are higher than the nist values by up to @xmath16 0.15 ryd for some of the levels , such as : 9 ( 2p@xmath8 @xmath13d@xmath12 ) , 10 ( 2p@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17 ) and 17 ( 2s3d @xmath11d@xmath18 ) .",
    "furthermore , the ordering is also mostly the same as that of nist .",
    "however , there are also striking differences , in both ordering and magnitude , for some of the levels , namely 45/46 [ ( 2p3d ) @xmath13f@xmath19 and @xmath13p@xmath20 , 53/54 [ 2s4d @xmath11d@xmath21 and 85 [ 2d4d @xmath11p@xmath22 , for which the discrepancy is up to 0.4 ryd .",
    "the inclusion of breit and qed effects ( grasp2 ) lowers the energies by a maximum of @xmath16 0.065 ryd , indicating that for this ion the higher relativistic effects are not too important .",
    "in addition , the ordering has slightly altered in a few instances , see for example levels 37/38 [ 2p3p @xmath13d@xmath12 and 2p3d @xmath11f@xmath23 and 60/61 [ 2s4f @xmath13f@xmath19 and 2p4s @xmath11p@xmath24 . however , the energy differences for these swapped levels are very small .",
    "our fac1 level energies agree with our grasp2 calculations within 0.04 ryd for all levels and the orderings are also the same .",
    "small differences in the grasp and fac energies arise mostly by the ways calculations of central potential for radial orbitals and recoupling schemes of angular parts have been performed ",
    "see detailed discussion in the fac manual .",
    "a further inclusion of the 2@xmath95@xmath10 configurations , labelled fac2 calculations in table 1 , makes no appreciable difference either in the magnitude or ordering of the levels .",
    "therefore , we are confident of our energy levels listed in table 1 , and assess these to be accurate to better than 0.5% .",
    "since currently available a- values in the literature are limited to transitions among the lowest 10 levels of ti xix , we here provide a complete set of data for all transitions among the 98 levels and for four types , namely electric dipole ( e1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) , as these are required in a plasma model .",
    "furthermore , the absorption oscillator strength ( @xmath25 ) and radiative rate a@xmath26 ( in s@xmath27 ) for a transition @xmath28 are related by the following expression @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , @xmath32 is the velocity of light , @xmath33 is the transition energy / wavelength in @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the lower ( @xmath37 ) and upper ( @xmath7 ) levels , respectively . similarly , the oscillator strength f@xmath38 ( dimensionless ) and the line strength s ( in atomic unit , 1 a.u .",
    "= 6.460@xmath3910@xmath40 cm@xmath8 esu@xmath8 ) are related by the standard equations given below @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for the electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions    @xmath42    for the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions    @xmath43    for the electric quadrupole ( e2 ) transitions",
    "@xmath44    and for the magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) transitions    @xmath45    in table 2 we present transition energies / wavelengths ( @xmath46 , in @xmath34 ) , radiative rates ( a@xmath26 , in s@xmath27 ) , oscillator strengths ( f@xmath38 , dimensionless ) , and line strengths ( s , in a.u . ) , in length form only , for all 1468 electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions among the 98 levels of ti xix .",
    "the _ indices _ used to represent the lower and upper levels of a transition have already been defined in table 1 .",
    "similarly , there are 1754 electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , 1424 magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and 1792 magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) transitions among the 98 levels . however , for these transitions only the a - values are listed in table 2 , and the corresponding results for f- or s- values can be easily obtained using eqs .",
    "( 15 ) .",
    "as noted earlier , a - values in the literature for ti xix are only available for a limited number of transitions .",
    "therefore , we have performed another calculation with the fac code of gu @xcite . in table 3",
    "we compare our a- values from both the grasp and fac codes for some transitions among the lowest 20 levels of ti xix .",
    "also included in this table are f- values from grasp because they give an indication of the strength of a transition .",
    "similarly , to facilitate easy comparison between the two calculations , we have also listed the ratio of a - values obtained with the grasp and fac codes .",
    "for these ( and many other ) transitions , the agreement between the two sets of a- values is better than 20% .",
    "indeed , for most strong transitions ( f @xmath47 0.01 ) , the a- values from grasp and fac agree to better than 20% , and the only exceptions are three transitions , namely 232 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48 ",
    "2p3p @xmath11s@xmath18 ) , 3271 ( 2p3p @xmath11s@xmath18  2p4d @xmath11d@xmath49 ) and 3283 ( 2p3p @xmath11s@xmath18 ",
    "2p4d @xmath13d@xmath49 ) , for which the discrepancies are up to 40% .",
    "these discrepancies mainly arise from the corresponding differences in the energy levels .",
    "furthermore , for a majority ( 80% ) of the strong e1 transitions ( f @xmath47 0.01 ) the length and velocity forms in our grasp calculations agree within 20% , and discrepancies for the others are mostly within a factor of two .",
    "however , for a few ( @xmath16 13% ) weaker transitions ( f @xmath50 10@xmath51 ) the two forms of the f- value differ by up to several orders of magnitude , and examples include : 424 ( f @xmath16 3@xmath3910@xmath52 ) , 492 ( f @xmath16 4@xmath3910@xmath53 ) , 2931 ( f @xmath16 5@xmath3910@xmath54 ) , 3031 ( f @xmath16 6@xmath3910@xmath53 ) and 3334 ( f @xmath16 3@xmath3910@xmath55 ) . finally , as for the energy levels , the effect of additional ci is negligible on the a- values , as results for all strong e1 transitions agree within @xmath16 20% with those obtained with the inclusion of the @xmath5 = 5 configurations . to conclude",
    ", we may state that for almost all strong e1 transitions , our radiative rates are accurate to better than 20% .",
    "however , for the weaker transitions the accuracy is comparatively poorer .",
    "the lifetime @xmath56 for a level @xmath7 is defined as follows @xcite :    @xmath57    since this is a measurable parameter , it provides a check on the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "therefore , in table 1 we have also listed our calculated lifetimes , which include the contributions from four types of transitions , i.e. e1 , e2 , m1 , and m2 . to our knowledge ,",
    "no calculations or measurements are available for lifetimes for any of the ti xix levels .",
    "however , we hope the present results will be useful for future comparisons and may encourage experimentalists to measure lifetimes , particularly for the level 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 which has a comparatively large value of @xmath16 1 ms .",
    "collision strengths ( @xmath3 ) are related to the more commonly known parameter collision cross section ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) by the following relationship @xcite :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the incident energy of the electron and @xmath35 is the statistical weight of the initial state .",
    "results for collisional data are preferred in the form of @xmath3 because it is a symmetric and dimensionless quantity .    for the computation of collision strengths @xmath3",
    ", we have employed the _ dirac atomic @xmath4-matrix code _ ( darc ) , which includes the relativistic effects in a systematic way , in both the target description and the scattering model .",
    "it is based on the @xmath6 coupling scheme , and uses the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian in the @xmath4-matrix approach .",
    "the @xmath4-matrix radius adopted for ti xix is 3.64 au , and 55 continuum orbitals have been included for each channel angular momentum in the expansion of the wavefunction , allowing us to compute @xmath3 up to an energy of 1150 ryd , i.e. @xmath16 1070 ryd _ above _ the highest threshold , equivalent to @xmath16 1.7@xmath3910@xmath62 k. this energy range is sufficient to calculate values of effective collision strength @xmath2 ( see section 6 ) up to t@xmath63 = 10@xmath1 k , well above the temperature of maximum abundance in ionisation equilibrium for ti xix , i.e. 10@xmath64 k @xcite .",
    "the maximum number of channels for a partial wave is 428 , and the corresponding size of the hamiltonian matrix is 23 579 . to obtain convergence of @xmath3 for all transitions and at all energies",
    ", we have included all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath65 40.5 , although a larger number would have been preferable for the convergence of some allowed transitions , especially at higher energies .",
    "however , to account for higher neglected partial waves , we have included a top - up , based on the coulomb - bethe approximation @xcite for allowed transitions and geometric series for others .    for illustration , in figs . 1 - 3 we show the variation of @xmath3 with angular momentum @xmath66 for three transitions of ti xix , namely 15 ( 2s@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17 ",
    "2s2p @xmath13p@xmath67 ) , 24 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48  2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) and 910 ( 2p@xmath8 @xmath13d@xmath17  2p@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17 ) , and at three energies of 100 , 500 and 900 ryd .",
    "the values of @xmath3 have not converged for allowed transitions as shown in fig .",
    "1 , for which a top - up has been included as mentioned above , and has been found to be appreciable .",
    "however , for all forbidden transitions , the values of @xmath3 have fully converged as shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "it is also clear from figs . 2 and 3 that a large range of partial waves is required for the convergence of @xmath3 for some of the forbidden transitions , particularly towards the higher end of the energy range .    in table 4",
    "we list our values of @xmath3 for resonance transitions of ti xix at energies _ above _ thresholds .",
    "the indices used to represent the levels of a transition have already been defined in table 1 .",
    "unfortunately , no similar data are available for comparison purposes as already noted in section 1 .",
    "therefore , to make an accuracy assessment for @xmath3 , we have performed another calculation using the fac code of gu @xcite .",
    "this code is also fully relativistic , and is based on the well - known and widely - used _ distorted - wave _ ( dw ) method  see for example , @xcite@xcite and the fac manual .",
    "furthermore , the same ci is included in fac as in the calculations from darc .",
    "therefore , also included in table 4 for comparison purposes are the @xmath3 values from fac at a single _ excited _ energy e@xmath68 , which corresponds to an incident energy of @xmath16 700 ryd for ti xix . for @xmath16 60% of the ti xix transitions ,",
    "the values of @xmath3 with the darc and fac codes agree within 20% at an energy of 700 ryd .",
    "however , the discrepancies for others are much higher , particularly for weaker transitions , such as : 130/31/35/39/73/77/83/89/91 .",
    "most of these are weak ( @xmath69 10@xmath55 ) and forbidden , i.e. the values of @xmath3 have fully converged at _ all _ energies within our adopted range of partial waves in the calculations with the darc code . for such weak transitions , values of @xmath3 from the fac code",
    "are not assessed to be accurate . additionally , for a few transitions , such as 4987 , 5072/86/98 , 5166/69/71/83/85 , 5268/72/86/98 and 5363/64/77/95 ,",
    "the values of @xmath3 from the fac code show a sudden increase , by orders of magnitude at some random energies , generally towards the higher end .",
    "this problem is common for many ions and examples of this can be seen in fig .",
    "6 of aggarwal and keenan @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sudden anomalous behaviour in @xmath3 with the fac code is also responsible for the differences noted above for many transitions .",
    "such anomalies for some transitions ( both allowed and forbidden ) from the fac calculations arise primarily because of the interpolation and extrapolation techniques employed in the code . in order to expedite calculations ,",
    "i.e. to generate a large amount of atomic data in a comparatively very short period of time , and without too large loss of accuracy , calculations of @xmath3 are not performed at each partial wave , but only at each @xmath66 up to 5 , and then the interval between successive calculations is doubled every two points , i.e. the grid is almost logarithmic  see the fac manual for further details .",
    "similarly , some differences in @xmath3 are expected because the dw method generally overestimates results due to the exclusion of channel coupling .    as a further comparison between the darc and fac values of @xmath3 , in fig .",
    "4 we show the variation of @xmath3 with energy for three _ allowed _ transitions among the excited levels of ti xix , namely 419 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49  2s3d @xmath11d@xmath70 ) , 520 ( 2s2p @xmath13p@xmath67 ",
    "2s3d @xmath13d@xmath12 ) , and 840 ( 2p@xmath8 @xmath11p@xmath12 ",
    "2p3d @xmath11d@xmath19 ) .",
    "for many transitions there are no discrepancies between the f- values obtained with the two different codes ( grasp and fac ) as demonstrated in table 3 , and therefore the values of @xmath3 also agree to better than 20% .",
    "similar comparisons between the two calculations with darc and fac are shown in fig . 5 for three _ forbidden _ transitions of ti xix , namely 112 ( 2s@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17 ",
    "2s3s @xmath13s@xmath17 ) , 24 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48  2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) , and 34 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath67  2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) . as in the case of the allowed transitions , for these forbidden ones",
    "the agreement between the two calculations is generally satisfactory , although there are some differences towards the lower end of the energy range .",
    "therefore , on the basis of these and other comparisons discussed above , collision strengths from our darc code are assessed to be accurate to better than 20% .",
    "however , similar data from fac are not assessed to be accurate for all transitions over an entire energy range .",
    "excitation rates , in addition to energy levels and radiative rates , are required for plasma modelling , and are determined from the collision strengths ( @xmath3 ) . since the threshold energy region is dominated by numerous closed - channel ( feshbach ) resonances , values of @xmath3 need to be calculated in a fine energy mesh to accurately account for their contribution .",
    "furthermore , in a plasma electrons have a wide distribution of velocities , and therefore values of @xmath3 are generally averaged over a _ maxwellian _ distribution as follows @xcite :",
    "@xmath71    where @xmath72 is boltzmann constant , t@xmath63 electron temperature in k , and e@xmath68 the electron energy with respect to the final ( excited ) state .",
    "once the value of @xmath2 is known the corresponding results for the excitation q(i , j ) and de - excitation q(j , i ) rates can be easily obtained from the following equations :    @xmath73    and @xmath74 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the initial ( @xmath37 ) and final ( @xmath7 ) states , respectively , and e@xmath38 is the transition energy . the contribution of resonances may enhance the values of @xmath2 over those of the background collision strengths ( @xmath75 ) , especially for the forbidden transitions , by up to an order of magnitude ( or even more ) depending on the transition and/or the temperature .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath3 need to be calculated over a wide energy range ( above thresholds ) to obtain convergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( 8) , as demonstrated in fig . 7 of aggarwal and keenan @xcite . it may be noted that if for practical reasons calculations of @xmath3 are performed only up to a limited range of energy then the high energy limits for a range of transitions can be invoked through the expressions suggested by burgess and tully @xcite .",
    "however , there is no such need in the present work as calculations for @xmath3 have been performed up to a reasonably high energy range , as noted in section 5 .    to delineate resonances ,",
    "we have performed our calculations of @xmath3 at over @xmath16 41 000 energies in the thresholds region .",
    "close to thresholds ( @xmath160.1 ryd above a threshold ) the energy mesh is 0.001 ryd , and away from thresholds is 0.002 ryd .",
    "hence care has been taken to include as many resonances as possible , and with as fine a resolution as is computationally feasible .",
    "the density and importance of resonances can be appreciated from figs .",
    "611 , where we plot @xmath3 as a function of energy in the thresholds region for the 12 ( 2s@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17 ",
    "2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48 ) , 13 ( 2s@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17 ",
    "2s2p @xmath11p@xmath67 ) , 14 ( 2s@xmath8 @xmath13s@xmath17  2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) , 23 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48 ",
    "2s2p @xmath11p@xmath67 ) , 24 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48  2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) and 34 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath67 ",
    "2s2p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) transitions , respectively .",
    "for all these ( and many other ) transitions the resonances are dense over the entire thresholds energy range , and hence make a significant contribution to @xmath2 over a wide range of temperatures . since for many transitions , resonances are dense and have high magnitude at energies close to the thresholds , a slight displacement in their positions can significantly affect the calculations of @xmath2 , mostly at the low temperatures , but not at the higher ones required for ti xix .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath2 are listed in table 5 over a wide temperature range up to 10@xmath1 k , suitable for applications to a variety of plasmas .",
    "corresponding data at any other temperature / s and/or in a different format in a machine readable form can also be requested from any one of the authors . as stated in section 1 ,",
    "there are only limited results available for comparison purposes .",
    "therefore , we have also calculated values of @xmath2 from our non - resonant @xmath3 data obtained with the fac code , and these are included at the lowest and the highest calculated temperatures .",
    "these calculations are particularly helpful in providing an estimate of the importance of resonances in the determination of excitation rates .",
    "furthermore , zhang and sampson @xcite ( zs ) have reported values of @xmath2 for transitions among the lowest 10 levels of ti xix . in their calculations , they have adopted the coulomb - born - exchange method and their results are stored in the chianti database at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/chianti_direct_data.html . in table 6",
    "we compare our results for @xmath2 , from both darc and fac , with those of zs at three temperatures of 10@xmath76 , 10@xmath64 and 10@xmath77 k. values of @xmath2 from fac generally agree with those of zs within 20% , because both calculations are based on the dw method and do not include the contribution of resonances . however , our corresponding results from darc are higher , by up to a factor of four , for many transitions , mostly forbidden .",
    "this is because of the inclusion of resonances in the calculations with darc .",
    "moreover , since resonances are spread over a wide energy range , as noted in figs . 611 , higher values of @xmath2 are sustained over the entire range of temperatures over which the calculations have been performed ",
    "see for example transitions 12/4/6/7/8/9/10 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath2 in table 6 is limited to the 45 transitions among the lowest 10 levels of ti xix . for a larger range of transitions ,",
    "about half have a discrepancy of more than 20% over the entire range of temperatures . at lower temperatures , the differences are generally within a factor of 5 , but are higher ( up to two orders of magnitude ) for some , such as : 238 ( 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath48 ",
    "2p3d @xmath11f@xmath78 ) , 611 ( 2p@xmath8 @xmath11p@xmath17  2s3s @xmath11s@xmath18 ) , 711 ( 2p@xmath8 @xmath11p@xmath18 ",

    "2s4p @xmath11p@xmath49 ) .",
    "similarly , towards higher temperatures , the discrepancies for most transitions are within a factor of two , but are larger by up to orders of magnitude for a few , such as : 238/43 , 611/14/16/17 and 711/18/19 . in most cases ,",
    "our results from darc are higher because of the inclusion of resonances . however , in a few cases the values of @xmath2 from fac are abnormally greater because of the anomaly in the calculated values of @xmath3 , as discussed in section 5 .",
    "in this paper we have presented results for energy levels and radiative rates for four types of transitions ( e1 , e2 , m1 , and m2 ) among the lowest 98 levels of ti xix belonging to the @xmath0 4 configurations .",
    "additionally , lifetimes of all the calculated levels have been reported , although no measurements or other theoretical results are available for comparison .",
    "however , based on a variety of comparisons among various calculations with the grasp and fac codes , our results for radiative rates , oscillator strengths , line strengths , lifetimes and collision strengths are judged to be accurate to better than 20% for a majority of the strong transitions ( levels ) .",
    "furthermore , for calculations of @xmath2 , resonances in the thresholds energy region are noted to be dominant for many transitions , and inclusion of their contribution has significantly enhanced the results . in the absence of other similar calculations ,",
    "it is difficult to fully assess the accuracy of our @xmath2 results .",
    "however , since we have considered a large range of partial waves to achieve convergence of @xmath3 at all energies , included a wide energy range to calculate values of @xmath2 up to t@xmath63 = 10@xmath1 k , and resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh to account for their contributions , we see no apparent deficiency in our reported data .",
    "therefore , based on the comparisons made in section 6 and our past experience with calculations on other ions , we estimate the accuracy of our results for @xmath2 to be better than 20% for most transitions .",
    "nevertheless , the present data for @xmath2 for transitions involving the levels of the @xmath5 = 4 configurations may perhaps be improved by the inclusion of the levels of the @xmath5 = 5 configurations .",
    "furthermore , for some highly charged ions , particularly he - like , the effect of radiation damping may reduce the contribution of resonances in the determination of effective collision strengths . while this may be true for a few transitions towards the lower end of the temperature range , as demonstrated by several workers ,",
    "see for example : @xcite@xcite , the effect is not appreciable at high temperatures at which data are applied in the modelling of plasmas , as discussed in some of our earlier papers , such as : @xcite@xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , scope remains for improvement in the reported data but until then we believe the present set of complete results for radiative and excitation rates for transitions in ti xix will be highly useful for the modelling of a variety of plasmas .",
