    "in the search for a theory of quantum gravity , black holes play an important role . since black holes behave as thermodynamic objects , with an entropy given by @xmath1  @xcite , they presumably are connected to the underlying microstates of quantum gravity .",
    "indeed , almost every modern approach to quantum gravity makes attempts , with varying degrees of success , to show that the number of microstates for a black hole matches that predicted by black hole thermodynamics ( see  @xcite for a review ) . with a top - down approach",
    "this is feasible - one has the fundamental theory and can define the particular solutions that represent a black hole in the macroscopic limit .",
    "these solutions have a statistical mechanics determined by the fundamental theory , and the resulting macroscopic thermodynamics can be compared with the laws of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt have a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it is therefore useful to analyze the statistical mechanics of black holes from a bottom up approach as well , in the hopes that information might be derived about the physics the statistical mechanics of the black hole microstates should follow . in doing",
    "so we immediately run into a puzzling problem .",
    "black hole thermodynamics is well defined in the semiclassical approximation : we know what spacetime represents a black hole and can investigate the behavior of quantum fields and small gravitational fluctuations on top of the background spacetime . in a full theory of quantum gravity",
    "this splitting is unacceptable .",
    "there is no background spacetime available and metric fluctuations due to the uncertainty principle will prevent the localization of a horizon . now our problem becomes clear : if we can not even identify the states that represent a black hole , how can we possibly analyze their statistical mechanics ?",
    "two approaches have been developed for dealing with this issue .",
    "the first is the `` horizon as boundary '' approach  @xcite which treats the black hole horizon as a boundary @xmath2 . imposing boundary conditions on the path integral for the metric inside and outside the horizon such that @xmath2 is a horizon yields the appropriate number of boundary states .",
    "another , more recent , alternative is to impose constraints directly on the theory such that @xmath2 is a horizon . in a recent work",
    ", carlip has shown that imposition of `` horizon constraints '' yields the appropriate number of microstates for black hole entropy  @xcite . in this approach",
    "@xmath2 is a spacelike initial data surface constrained to be a stretched horizon . for a review of both these approaches",
    "see also  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the notion of a stretched horizon is important for this work , so i now take a little time to explain what it is and why it is useful .",
    "naively , one would want @xmath2 to be a true black hole event horizon .",
    "this is problematic however as the event horizon is a global object and requires knowledge about the entire spacetime as opposed to a local picture for microstates .",
    "a local definition of horizon which still captures black hole thermodynamics is that of an isolated horizon  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for overviews of the isolated horizons program ) .",
    "an isolated horizon is essentially just a null hypersurface with vanishing expansion of the null normal .. therefore @xmath2 is not a true isolated horizon , however the geometric characteristics are the same . ]",
    "this is still not quite good enough , as the approach of carlip requires that @xmath2 be an initial data surface and hence spacelike .",
    "if , however , one takes @xmath2 to be a spacelike stretched horizon , which is defined as a nearly null spacelike hypersurface that traces a true isolated horizon , then one can use the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity .    assuming that @xmath2 is a stretched horizon",
    ", carlip looks at the algebra of diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 in 2-d dilaton gravity .",
    "the usual generators of translations along the surface and local lorentz boosts in general relativity do not preserve the horizon constraints . if @xmath2 is to be a horizon , however , then the generators _ must _ preserve the horizon constraints , which means that they should be modified from their usual form .",
    "the necessary modification of the generators leads to a generator algebra equivalent to that of a conformal field theory with non - zero central charge and a calculation of the density of states using the cardy formula yields the standard result for the entropy of a black hole .",
    "this result is intriguing as it tells us about the density of states from the classical symmetries of the action , rather than some specific quantum gravity model .",
    "however , it also suffers some limitations .",
    "the primary shortcoming is that the constraint approach in the hamiltonian formulation can not handle dynamics ( as the initial data surface is the horizon ) and therefore can not yield information about black hole evolution .",
    "in contrast , the first law of black hole thermodynamics is specifically about dynamics . in this paper ,",
    "i show how the imposition of horizon constraints for a dynamical schwarzschild black hole generates a matter energy - momentum flux at the horizon that agrees with the first law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "intuitively how does this happen ?",
    "let us step back and consider more generally what happens to the structure of general relativity when we require @xmath2 to be a horizon .",
    "relativity is often labelled as `` diffeomorphism invariant '' and , of course , it is .",
    "however , special relativity is also diffeomorphism invariant ( as is almost any reasonable theory of physics that we have ) since it produces the same observable results no matter what coordinate system one uses to calculate in .",
    "the real way in which general relativity is unique is that there are no background geometrical objects , unlike special relativity where the spacetime metric is fixed to be the minkowski metric .",
    "the fact that every field in the action is dynamical has important consequences;the most relevant of which for this paper is that it leads to the conservation of the matter stress tensor via noether s theorem .",
    "the constraint approach violates this tenet of general relativity .",
    "the requirement that @xmath2 is a horizon constitutes a fixed background geometry and hence will generally lead to a conservation anomaly - the matter stress tensor can not be conserved at the horizon .",
    "if the theory is completely classical then this is a problem as the matter stress tensor is conserved as a consequence of the matter equations of motion .",
    "the only way out is for the matter fields to be off shell , i.e. there must be some purely quantum mechanical effect in the matter sector responsible for generating matter flux at the horizon .",
    "fortunately , in a black hole spacetime we have exactly such an effect : hawking radiation !",
    "hawking radiation from a spherically symmetric black hole reduces the area of the horizon according to the first law of black hole thermodynamics , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the ( negative ) energy flux of the current @xmath5 across the horizon @xmath2 ( where @xmath6 is the killing field for which @xmath2 is a killing horizon ) , @xmath7 is the surface gravity of the black hole , and @xmath8 is the area of the horizon cross section . there is no guarantee , of course , that the flux generated from requiring @xmath2 to be a dynamical horizon should match this law .",
    "however , i show that for schwarzschild geometry this actually is the case up to an undetermined constant , and that the exact first law is recovered if this constant is chosen to be unity .",
    "i now turn to the derivation of this result .",
    "consider a local region @xmath9 of a manifold @xmath10 in a coordinate system @xmath11 .",
    "( eventually spherical symmetry will be assumed and @xmath12 will be the angular directions . ) i can define a hypersurface @xmath2 by the condition @xmath13 and a vector field @xmath14 such that @xmath15 generates @xmath2 .",
    "one should think of @xmath14 as the ( approximate ) killing field for which @xmath2 is to be a killing horizon .",
    "furthermore , define a covector field @xmath16 , proportional to @xmath17 , such that on @xmath2 i have @xmath18 .",
    "this construction is metric independent since i have not yet imposed any restrictions on @xmath19 .",
    "i remind the reader that @xmath14 and @xmath16 are not to be considered dynamical fields , but rather fixed background geometrical objects .",
    "i now must decide how to impose the constraints that make @xmath2 a horizon .",
    "a horizon emitting hawking radiation is not quite null , but instead slightly timelike  @xcite",
    ". therefore the hamiltonian formulation of carlip is not directly applicable as @xmath2 can not be an initial data surface .",
    "instead i shall work in the lagrangian formulation and enforce the constraints via lagrange multipliers in the action .",
    "i take @xmath2 to be a timelike , instead of spacelike , stretched horizon ( a timelike membrane in the language of  @xcite ) .",
    "as well , i will not require the expansion @xmath20 of @xmath14 to identically vanish but instead be infinitesimally small , which will give an infinitesimal change in the cross sectional area of the horizon .",
    "hence the constraints are    1 .",
    "@xmath21 2 .",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath23 are infinitesimal on @xmath2 and @xmath24 is the projection tensor @xmath25 .",
    "so far i have not said anything about the surface gravity of the horizon , which also needs to be specified when analyzing the dynamics of a black hole .",
    "if @xmath2 was a true null surface then @xmath26 would be zero and constant along @xmath2 , which implies that the the directional derivative of @xmath27 would be of the usual form @xmath28 where @xmath7 is the surface gravity . since @xmath14 is not quite null @xmath29 is not proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "in spherical symmetry @xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a function that depends on the evolution of the surface .",
    "contracting with @xmath32 gives @xmath33    if i impose the constraint @xmath34 then as @xmath35 the @xmath36 term drops out of ( [ eq : idoth ] ) .",
    "so , finally , i fix the surface gravity @xmath7 by imposing two additional constraints on @xmath2 ,    1 .",
    "@xmath37 2 .",
    "@xmath38    which gives the right value for @xmath7 on the constraint surface .",
    "there is still an ambiguity in @xmath32 as the above conditions do not uniquely fix @xmath16 on @xmath9 .",
    "i use this freedom to further choose @xmath32 such that it satisfies the geodesic equation , @xmath39 .",
    "note that this last choice for @xmath32 is not a constraint as it is not a consequence of the presence of a horizon with surface gravity @xmath7 .",
    "therefore it will not be implemented with a specific constraint term in the action . instead ,",
    "given a solution for @xmath40 and @xmath16 on @xmath2 i simply choose @xmath16 to satisfy the geodesic equation everywhere .",
    "the constraints are to be imposed only on @xmath2 . using the dirac delta function , defined by @xmath41 the constraints",
    "can be enforced only on @xmath2 by adding them to the action , @xmath42\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the matter lagrangian ( as a function of matter fields @xmath44 ) and the @xmath45 s are lagrange multipliers .",
    "the choice of volume element for the constraint terms requires some explanation . integrating over @xmath46 ,",
    "the extra constraint terms can be rewritten as @xmath47 at first glance , this term seems wrong as the integration over @xmath2 naturally involves the determinant of the induced metric @xmath48 on @xmath2 , rather than @xmath49 .",
    "however , let us consider more carefully the effect on , for example , the surface gravity constraint if the volume element was chosen to be @xmath50 .",
    "on @xmath2 , the equation of motion derived from varying @xmath51 is @xmath52 which enforces @xmath53 only if @xmath54 . in the limit as @xmath55",
    ", @xmath2 becomes null and @xmath56 as well . in this limit",
    "the constraint @xmath57 is completely lost as the @xmath51 equation of motion is satisfied for any value of @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the natural volume element on @xmath2 is _ not _ the appropriate quantity to use for enforcing constraints .",
    "integrating the constraints with respect to the four volume element @xmath49 does , however , enforce the constraints as @xmath49 is non - vanishing everywhere ( as long as the metric is non - singular ) .",
    "varying ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to the lagrange multipliers enforces the constraints . varying ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to @xmath58 and using the identity @xmath59 (",
    "since @xmath14 is a generator of @xmath2 ) yields the modified einstein equation @xmath60 @xmath61 , the constraint `` stress tensor '' , is given by @xmath62 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber + h_\\alpha h_\\beta \\nabla_\\gamma ( \\lambda_\\kappa \\delta(u ) i^\\gamma ) + \\delta(u ) \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\nabla_\\gamma(\\lambda_\\theta h^\\gamma p_{\\alpha \\beta})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 .",
    "note that in ( [ eq : c1 ] ) i have imposed the constraints and dropped terms that vanish ( such as those from the variation of @xmath49 ) when the constraints are satisfied .",
    "@xmath61 can be further simplified by noting that in the limit of @xmath35 , @xmath14 is the generator of a null hypersurface and so @xmath64 where @xmath65 is some scalar function . in this limit the @xmath66 terms in the second line of ( [ eq : c1 ] )",
    "cancel , leaving the simpler expression    @xmath67   + h_\\alpha h_\\beta \\nabla_\\gamma ( \\lambda_\\kappa \\delta(u ) i^\\gamma).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    i now discuss how the presence of @xmath61 in the field equations affects the conservation of the matter stress tensor .",
    "let us consider a simple black hole geometry , that of a schwarzschild black hole . hence from this point on spherical symmetry is assumed and all quantities are independent of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath68 vanishes and so contracting ( [ eq : ee ] ) with @xmath69 and taking the divergence yields    @xmath70    i now integrate ( [ eq : div ] ) over an infinitesimally wide region @xmath71 that contains a portion of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "since the terms in ( [ eq : div ] ) are total divergences stokes theorem gives @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the normal to the boundary @xmath74 of @xmath71 and @xmath75 is determinant of the induced metric @xmath76 on @xmath74 .",
    "i choose @xmath74 such that @xmath32 generates @xmath74 across @xmath2 . since @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath77 and i",
    "have the constraints @xmath78 , @xmath32 generates translations in the @xmath46 direction .",
    "i will therefore be integrating over @xmath46 and so can easily evaluate the integral over @xmath79 .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ eq : intdiv ] ) is simply @xmath80 times the total matter flux @xmath4 emanating from the horizon through the surface @xmath74 . without the constraints this would be zero , corresponding to no anomalous flux for the approximate killing field @xmath14 .",
    "i now evaluate the left hand side of ( [ eq : intdiv ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 is @xmath82 \\\\ \\nonumber + h_\\alpha h^2 \\nabla_\\gamma ( \\lambda_\\kappa \\delta(u ) i ^\\gamma)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i have applied the liebniz rule to put the @xmath66 term in the above form . in the limit as @xmath14 is null , the @xmath66 term vanishes .",
    "the presence of the delta functions implies that there is only a contribution to the integral when @xmath74 crosses @xmath2 ( the two dimensional surfaces @xmath83 in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore i can safely use the identity @xmath84 .",
    "contracting with @xmath73 and applying @xmath85 , i have @xmath86 i now rewrite the last term in ( [ eq : ndotcdoth ] ) to move the delta function outside the derivative . using the identity @xmath87 the last term can be rewritten as @xmath88\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 .",
    "the last term in ( [ eq : kappaterm ] ) vanishes in the limit @xmath90 as @xmath91 and ( as chosen previously ) @xmath32 satisfies the geodesic equation .",
    "the plus / minus is present as @xmath73 changes orientation from @xmath92 ( where @xmath73 is approximately parallel to @xmath32 ) to @xmath93 ( where the two vectors are approximately anti - parallel ) .",
    "the @xmath94 term in ( [ eq : kappaterm ] ) can be integrated over @xmath74 by parts and becomes @xmath95 there is no boundary term due to the presence of the delta function .",
    "the entire integral in ( [ eq : intdiv ] ) is then proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "integrating over the delta function ( [ eq : intdiv ] ) becomes @xmath96\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath97 signifies that the result is the sum of the integrals over @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "again replacing @xmath73 by @xmath98 one sees that the @xmath99 term vanishes as @xmath100 . applying the constraint @xmath57 , @xmath100 , and ( again ) the fact that @xmath32 satisfies the geodesic equation the last two terms combine and i have @xmath101 now note that in this coordinate system @xmath75 is equal to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the induced metric on @xmath104 . the factors of @xmath105",
    "cancel and i am finally left with @xmath106 if @xmath51 varies between @xmath92 and @xmath93 then there is a non - zero @xmath4 even if the geometry does not change .",
    "however , this does not correspond to the case of interest , where the flux is due to the time dependence of the geometry and not the time dependence of the lagrange multipliers .",
    "therefore @xmath51 should be chosen to be a constant .",
    "if i choose @xmath107 then i recover that the generated matter flux satisfies the first law of black hole thermodynamics , @xmath108 which is the promised result . in summary",
    ", i have shown that requiring the presence of a horizon with surface gravity @xmath7 by imposing constraints in the gravitational action also generates a ( necessarily quantum mechanical ) matter flux which , at least for schwarzschild geometry , agrees with the first law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "there are some open issues with the above result .",
    "the most pressing is obviously the value of @xmath51 .",
    "while the choice @xmath107 is not an exceptional or fine tuned value , there is no _ a priori _ reason why this choice is the correct one .",
    "the difficulty in determining @xmath51 stems from the fact that i am using the variation of the horizon to determine the generated matter flux without reference to any matter equations of motion .",
    "if the ( quantum mechanical ) matter response was known then it is possible that the value of @xmath51 could be fixed by applying the constraint .",
    "however , without the matter field equations this method of determining @xmath51 is not applicable .",
    "another open issue is the connection with carlip s method for calculating black hole entropy .",
    "one would hope that a connection can be made since the underlying approach , applying constraints to force a horizon , is the same . if a connection can be made and in the framework presented here the entropy can be shown to be @xmath109 , then the first law is a true thermodynamic equation since in this derivation it relates the outgoing energy flux to the number of microstates of the full quantum theory .",
    "there are a few obstacles that still need to be overcome in order to relate the two approaches .",
    "since the horizon surface is a timelike hypersurface here ( as it must be to emit hawking radiation ) , it is somewhat unclear how to proceed with the hamiltonian framework .",
    "furthermore , the constraints on the surface gravity do not appear in the formalism of carlip , so there is no guarantee that the algebra of constraints is identical .",
    "if these technical problems can be overcome , then the constraint program might yield not only the number of microstates of a black hole , but also more directly tie hawking radiation and the laws of black hole thermodynamics to the microscopic theory of quantum gravity .",
