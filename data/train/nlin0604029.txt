    "wave - particle interaction is central to the operation of electron devices and to the understanding of basic plasma behavior and more generally of systems with long range interaction or global coupling .",
    "specifically , travelling wave tubes are ideal to study wave - particle interaction @xcite . in the experiments reported here , the electron beam density is so low that it does not induce any significant growth of the waves .",
    "when waves are launched in the tube with an external antenna , the beam electrons can be considered as test particles in the potential of electrostatic waves .",
    "this recently allowed the direct exploration of nonlinear particle synchronization @xcite by a single non resonant wave with a phase velocity different from the beam velocity .",
    "in this paper we focus on the resonant case when the beam and the waves propagate with similar velocities . for a single wave ,",
    "we observe beam trapping in the potential troughs of the wave .",
    "when at least two waves propagate we observe a large velocity spread of the essentially mono - kinetic initial beam .",
    "this spread can be related to a transition to large scale chaos through resonance overlap and destruction of invariant kam ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser ) tori @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the velocity spreading is not smooth and occurs through successive steps as the waves amplitudes increase .",
    "the motion of a charged particle in two electrostatic waves has been used as a paradigm system to describe the transition to large - scale chaos in hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is well known that hamiltonian phase space exhibits a scale invariance with infinitely nested resonant islands @xcite .",
    "we show that the observed steps in the measured velocity distribution function are related to the underlying `` devil s staircase '' behavior .    numerous nonlinear driven systems in physics , astronomy , and engineering exhibit striking responses with complex phase - locking plateaus characterized by devil s staircase , arnold tongues , and farey trees @xcite .",
    "these structures are mainly seen at work in stationary and space - extended objects , when an elastic lattice interacts with a periodic substrate found in a wide variety of condensed matter systems including charge - density waves @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , frenkel - kontorova - type models of friction @xcite , unusual growth mode of crystals @xcite , and in semiconductor - metal phase transition @xcite .",
    "they are also at work in the quantum hall effects @xcite .",
    "but very few dynamical systems have so far allowed their observation",
    ". only indirect observations of statistically locked - in transport through periodic potential landscapes have been made @xcite .",
    "here we present a direct experimental evidence of a `` devil s staircase '' for wave - particle interaction @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the principle of the test beam experiment in the twt . in sec .",
    "iii , we report the main results on the interaction of the test beam with one or two waves . in sec .",
    "iv , we briefly recall the main results on the transition to large scale chaos in hamiltonian systems and show some numerical results for the paradigm motion of a charged particle in two waves . in sec .",
    "v , we compare the experimental results with the numerical predictions .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are drawn in sec .",
    "a travelling wave tube @xcite consists of two main elements : an electron gun , and a slow wave structure along which waves propagate with a phase velocity much lower than the velocity of light , which may be approximately equal to the electron beam velocity .",
    "the long travelling wave tube sketched in fig .",
    "1 has been designed to mimic beam - plasma interaction @xcite .",
    "its slow wave structure is formed by a helix with axially movable antennas .",
    "the electron gun produces a quasi - mono - kinetic electron beam which propagates along the axis of the slow wave structure and is confined by a strong axial magnetic field of @xmath0  t. its central part consists of the grid - cathode subassembly of a ceramic microwave triode and the anode is replaced by a copper plate with an on - axis hole whose aperture defines the beam diameter equal to @xmath1 .",
    "beam currents , @xmath2 , and maximal cathode voltages , @xmath3 , can be set independently . two correction coils ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) provide perpendicular magnetic fields to control the tilt of the electron beam with respect to the axis of the helix .",
    "the slow wave structure consists of a wire helix that is rigidly held together by three threaded alumina rods and is enclosed by a glass vacuum tube .",
    "the pump pressure at the ion pumps on both ends of the device is @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 long helix is made of a @xmath6 diameter be - cu wire ; its radius is equal to @xmath7 and its pitch to @xmath8 .",
    "a resistive rf termination at each end of the helix reduces reflections .",
    "the maximal voltage standing wave ratio is @xmath9 due to residual end reflections and irregularities of the helix .",
    "the glass vacuum jacket is enclosed by an axially slotted @xmath10 radius cylinder that defines the rf ground . inside this cylinder but outside the vacuum jacket",
    "are four axially movable antennas labelled from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and azimuthally separated by @xmath13 ; they are capacitively coupled to the helix , each of them being characterized by its coupling coefficient which gives the ratio of the amplitude of the wave actually excited on the helix to the amplitude of the signal launched on the antenna ; these antennas can excite or detect helix modes in the frequency range from 5 to 95 mhz .",
    "only the helix modes are launched , since empty waveguide modes can only propagate above @xmath14 .",
    "these modes have electric field components along the helix axis @xcite . launched electromagnetic waves travel along the helix at the speed of light ; their phase velocities , @xmath15 , along the axis of the helix are smaller by approximately the tangent of the pitch angle , giving @xmath16 .",
    "a beam intensity @xmath17 lower than @xmath18  na ensures that the electron beam with mean velocity @xmath19 does not induces any significant wave growth over the tube length ; since the potential drop over the beam radius @xmath20 is negligible , the beam electrons can be considered as test particles .",
    "finally the cumulative changes of the electron beam distribution are measured with a trochoidal velocity analyzer at the end of the interaction region .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath21 ) of the electrons passes through a hole in the center of the front collector , and is slowed down by three retarding electrodes . by operating a selection of electrons through the use of the drift velocity caused by an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field , the direct measurement of the current collected behind a tiny off - axis hole gives the time averaged beam axial energy distribution @xcite . retarding potential and measured current",
    "are computer controlled , allowing an easy acquisition and treatment with an energy resolution lower than @xmath22 .",
    "we first checked that , in the absence of any applied external signal on the antenna , the test electron beam propagates without perturbation along the axis of the device .      in the first experiment",
    ", we apply an oscillating signal at a frequency of @xmath23  mhz on antenna @xmath11 . according to the helix dispersion relation , a travelling wave propagates along the helix with a phase velocity @xmath24",
    "[ fig2]a shows a 2d contour plot ( with logarithmically scaled color coding ) of the velocity distribution function for a test beam , with intensity @xmath25  na and initial velocity @xmath26 , measured at the outlet of the tube after its interaction , over a length of @xmath27  m , with the helix mode .",
    "it is the result of linear interpolation of the recorded measurements obtained for different applied signal amplitudes varying from @xmath28 to @xmath29 by steps of @xmath30 .",
    "each velocity distribution function measurement is obtained by scanning the retarding voltage of the trochoidal velocity analyzer with a step of @xmath31  mv .",
    "when the wave amplitude is gradually increased , we observe that the width of the velocity domain in which the test beam electrons are spread increases like the square root of the wave amplitude as expected if the electrons are trapped in the potential troughs of the wave . no attention must be given to the apparent regular discontinuous steps due to bad sampling of the amplitudes and interpolation between successive measurements . from the measured antenna coupling coefficients @xcite ,",
    "the helix wave amplitude @xmath32 can be estimated .",
    "the resonant or trapping domain in velocity can thus be deduced and is indicated by the continuous lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a which correspond to @xmath33 ; here @xmath34 is the charge to mass ratio of the electron . we observe a very good agreement with measurement .",
    "[ fig2]b is obtained in the same way as fig .",
    "[ fig2]a but corresponds to a larger interaction length since the emitting antenna is located at @xmath35  m from the device output .",
    "each velocity distribution function measurement is obtained by scanning the retarding voltage of the trochoidal velocity analyzer with a step of @xmath36  mv to speed up data acquisition without deteriorating significantly the accuracy of our observations .",
    "we observe that the shape of the velocity domain in which the test beam electrons are spread is very different from fig .",
    "[ fig2]a . a new feature appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b is a further velocity bunching of the electrons around their initial velocity for an amplitude equal to @xmath37 .",
    "this phenomenon is also related to the trapping of the electrons in the wave .",
    "if we refer to the rotating bar model @xcite to describe the trapped electrons motion , we expect oscillations between small spread in velocity and large spread in position ( corresponding to initial conditions for a cold test beam ) to large spread in velocity and small spread in position after half a bounce or trapping period equal to @xmath38 . to the bounce period",
    ", we can associate a bounce length @xmath39 . for @xmath40",
    ", we get @xmath41 which is precisely the interaction length @xmath42 of fig .",
    "we thus confirm that fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is displaying the trapping of the test beam in a single wave .",
    "varying @xmath17 from @xmath43 to @xmath18  na would not change the result since no self - consistent effect occurs .",
    "one may remark that fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also displays a systematic accumulation of particles in the high velocity region for which we do not have a simple explanation and which probably requires further investigation out of the scope of the present paper .      in the second experiment",
    ", we apply , on antenna @xmath44 chosen for its strongest coupling with the helix and located at @xmath45  m from the device output , a signal generated by an arbitrary waveform generator made of two components with well defined phases : again one at the same frequency of @xmath46  mhz , and a new one at a frequency of @xmath47  mhz . according to the helix dispersion relation , two travelling waves",
    "propagate along the helix , the former with a phase velocity @xmath48  m / s as before , the latter with a different phase velocity @xmath49  m / s ( the fact that the second wave is a harmonic of the first one in the laboratory frame is irrelevant in the beam frame ) .",
    "[ fig3]a ( resp . fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) is obtained in the same way as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for a test beam , with intensity @xmath50  na and initial velocity @xmath51 ( resp .",
    "@xmath52 ) , whose velocity distribution function is measured at the outlet of the tube after its interaction with the two propagating helix modes . as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the continuous ( resp",
    ".  dashed ) parabola shows the trapping velocity domain associated to the helix mode at @xmath47  mhz ( resp .",
    "@xmath46  mhz ) .",
    "as it appears clearly , the amplitudes of the two modes have been appropriately chosen such that these trapping domains approximately have the same velocity extension when taking into account the coupling coefficient of the antenna at the two working frequencies . both in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , we observe that , for a threshold amplitude exceeding the amplitude corresponding to overlap of the trapping domains , the velocity distribution function exhibits a strong velocity spread .",
    "electrons initially trapped inside the potential well of one of the helix modes can escape the trapping domain and explore a much wider velocity region in phase space . according to their initial velocity",
    ", electrons can be strongly accelerated ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) or decelerated ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) sticking mainly to the border of the new velocity domain they are allowed to explore .",
    "we shall later relate this behavior to the transition to large scale chaos for the motion of a charged particle in two electrostatic waves .",
    "such a description would suggest that fig .",
    "[ fig3]b could be obtained by a mere reflection of fig .",
    "[ fig3]a with respect to the average velocity of the two waves .",
    "the observed asymmetry can result from the different transit times of the test particles over the finite length of the tube in both cases , and from the already noticed accumulation of particles toward higher velocities of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .      in the third experiment",
    ", we apply an oscillating signal at a frequency of @xmath46  mhz on antenna @xmath44 as in the first experiment for maximum interaction length @xmath35  m. but we now consider a test beam , with intensity @xmath53  na and initial velocity @xmath54  m / s much lower than @xmath55 , the phase velocity of the helix mode at @xmath46  mhz . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is obtained in the same way as fig .",
    "the continuous parabola indicates the velocity domain associated to particle trapping in the potential troughs of the helix mode at @xmath46  mhz .",
    "since the initial beam velocity lies far out of this domain we expect that , for moderate wave amplitude , the beam electrons will experience a mere velocity modulation around their initial velocity , with a modulation amplitude increasing linearly with the applied signal amplitude .",
    "this behavior has been studied in detail in ref .  [ 3 ] and would generate two main peaks around the ( oblique straight ) continuous lines originating in @xmath19 .",
    "in fact we observe that the electrons spread over a velocity domain with typical width increasing as the square root of the applied signal amplitude as shown by the dashed parabola .",
    "this strongly recalls the results of fig .",
    "indeed the applied signal generates two waves : a helix mode with a phase velocity @xmath55 , and a beam mode with a phase velocity equal to the beam velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the beam mode with phase velocity @xmath19 is actually the superposition of two indistinguishable modes with pulsation @xmath56 corresponding to the beam plasma mode with pulsation @xmath57^{1/2}$ ] for a beam with density @xmath58 , doppler - shifted by the beam velocity @xmath19 , merging in a single mode since @xmath59 in our conditions @xcite .",
    "thus fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the test electrons trapping into the beam mode .",
    "this is confirmed by a careful analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which exhibits the same velocity bunching of the electrons around their initial velocity as in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , for amplitudes obtained by equating the interaction length to a multiple of half the trapping length .",
    "one also notices that the amplitude of the beam mode is lower than the amplitude of the launched helix mode ; this explains why its influence has been neglected in the previous analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where two helix modes are externally excited .",
    "since , when we increase the applied signal amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the two trapping domains of the helix and the beam mode overlap , we observe the same behavior as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . above a certain applied signal amplitude threshold",
    "the distribution function spreads over a much wider velocity domain , and electrons can be strongly accelerated .",
    "another striking feature appears in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which is best emphasized in the zoom of fig .",
    "the transition to large velocity spread does not occur continuously but rather occurs by steps when the applied signal amplitude increases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b , plateaus are formed in the measured velocity distribution function for the maximum interaction length . a closer look at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] also reveals the presence of such steps in the case of two independently launched waves with equal amplitudes .",
    "we will now show that this generic phenomenon is related to the intrinsic structure of hamiltonian phase space for non integrable systems .",
    "we consider charged test particles moving in two electrostatic waves .",
    "the equation modelling the dynamics in this case is @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the amplitudes , wave numbers , frequencies and phases of the two waves ; @xmath34 is the charge to mass ratio of the particle .",
    "the motion of the particles governed by this equation is a mixture of regular and chaotic behaviors mainly depending on the amplitudes of the waves @xcite and exhibits generic features of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "poincar sections of the dynamics ( a stroboscopic plot of selected trajectories ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . taking advantage of the symmetry",
    "@xmath65 , two different cases are superposed in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the strength of chaos is measured by the dimensionless overlap parameter defined as the ratio @xmath66 of the sum of the resonant velocity half - widths of the two wave potential wells to their phase velocity difference @xcite .    for intermediate wave amplitudes ,",
    "nested regular structures appear as secondary resonances with a wave number @xmath67 , a frequency @xmath68 , a phase @xmath69 and an effective amplitude @xmath70 with integer @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as shown in the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig6]a for @xmath73 .",
    "the self - similar structure of phase space results from the infinitely nested higher order resonances @xcite which appear in so - called arnold tongues between secondary resonances as predicted by the poincar - birkhoff theorem @xcite .    for larger wave amplitudes ,",
    "a wide connected zone of chaotic behavior occurs in between the primary resonances due to the destruction of the so - called kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori acting as barriers in phase space , as shown in the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig6]a for @xmath74 . between these two values of @xmath75 , invariant tori",
    "are sequentially destroyed and replaced by cantori .",
    "transport in velocity ( and thereby in @xmath76 space ) occurs through the holes of the cantori , which have a fractal structure @xcite .",
    "when a torus breaks , the flux through it is still zero , as the associated turnstile has vanishing area : trajectories leak easily through its holes only for @xmath75 values significantly above its destruction threshold . for the dynamics @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , which is close to our experimental conditions ,",
    "the threshold for large scale chaos ( destruction of the most robust torus ) is near @xmath79 , as seen from the poincar section of orbits over long times ( fig.[fig6 ] , ( b - c ) ) .",
    "if one considers a beam of initially monokinetic particles having a velocity equal to the phase velocity of one of the waves , this chaotic zone is associated with a large spread of the velocities after some time since the particles are moving in the chaotic sea created by the overlap of the two resonances @xcite . in analogy with the experimental conditions , we compute ( with a second order centered symplectic integrator ) the trajectories of 1 million particles initially uniformly spread in position with the same velocity ( equal to 1 ) .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , as the overlap parameter increases , the beam wiggles more and is spread over a wider velocity range @xcite .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and @xmath80 , the transition to large scale chaos occurs by vertical steps , related to the presence of the nested secondary resonances , with height scaling as the amplitudes @xmath81 .",
    "therefore the border of the velocity domain over which the beam is spread exhibits a devil s staircase - like behavior .",
    "[ fig8]a is the result of applying the same treatment as applied to experimental data in section [ secexp ] to the computed velocity distribution function obtained for different overlap parameters varying from 0 to 1 by steps of @xmath82 keeping the wave amplitude ratio constant and approximately equal to the experimental value of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . each velocity distribution function",
    "is obtained by recording the velocity histogram of our @xmath83 particles over 1600 boxes with normalized velocity width equal to @xmath84 after an integration time @xmath85 equal to 10 poincar periods . even for an overlap parameter equal to 1 , during the integration time @xmath85",
    ", the particles could not explore the whole chaotic sea between the two main resonances .",
    "but the particles could typically experience one complete trapping motion as shown by the periodic velocity bunching and related same horizontally wedge - shaped regions as experimentally observed in fig .",
    "an asymmetric plateau @xcite is formed in the velocity distribution function as exemplified in the insert of fig .",
    "the detailed analysis of the border of the distribution function displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig8]b shows that this plateau can be associated to the secondary resonance characterized by integers @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig9 ] is obtained in the same way as fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] but corresponds to a longer integration time @xmath85 equal to 20 poincar periods .",
    "now the particles can explore the whole chaotic sea in between the two main resonances , and finer details of the `` devil s staircase '' associated to the presence of the nested secondary resonances can be observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b showing the low velocity border of the computed chaotic domain , the position of some of the most important secondary resonances is indicated with a label corresponding to their characteristic integers @xmath87 .",
    "it appears clearly that the presence of a secondary resonance results in a step in the 2d contour plot of the distribution function .",
    "the most striking feature is the great similarity with the above experimental results which can now be reexamined in the light of the two - waves model .",
    "to allow easier comparison with numerical simulations , we compute the overlap parameter of the helix and the beam modes .",
    "the wave amplitude can be estimated by fitting the trapping domain with a parabola as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] to fig .",
    "as already mentioned , we checked that , for the helix mode , this estimate is in very good agreement with the amplitude deduced from measuring the antenna coupling coefficient with three antennas @xcite .",
    "then we display the upper velocity domain border ( i.e. the location of the upper steep edge of the plateau as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) as the applied signal amplitude is varied .",
    "we thus obtain fig .",
    "the experimentally observed steps are clearly related to the presence of secondary resonances labelled @xmath88 with @xmath72 = 1 ,  2 ,  3 .    for a different initial beam velocity , fig .",
    "[ fig10]a shows the upper velocity domain border as the applied signal amplitude is varied by steps of @xmath89  v ; only the steps associated to the main secondary resonances @xmath90 for @xmath91 can be observed .",
    "the points plotted are the outcome of a single set of measurements ; the solid line is a guide to the eye . by reducing the signal amplitude steps to @xmath92  v , more details of the devil s staircase can be observed and higher order resonances show up .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig10]b , more steps are observed such as @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 which stand among the next strongest resonances in the farey tree structure . in this latter plot , two new ,",
    "independent measurements have been reported ( as circles and squares ) @xcite to give an estimate of the experimental errors , and the solid line interpolates between their averages .",
    "the behavior reported in fig .",
    "[ fig10]a and fig .",
    "[ fig10]b is typical of self - similar phenomena .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we focused our attention on the velocity domain in between the two main resonances . as shown by the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , we also observe vertical steps associated with resonances ( 1,-5 ) and ( 1,-6 ) ; this feature is also obvious in the numerical simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] where a step associated with resonance ( 1,-3 ) clearly appears on the upper part .",
    "since numerical simulations deal with a restricted number of particles ( typically 1 million ) , only the steps associated with lower @xmath72 s appear .",
    "we have thus exhibited that measuring the energy distribution of the electron beam at the output of a travelling wave tube allows a direct experimental exploration of fractal features of the complex hamiltonian phase space .",
