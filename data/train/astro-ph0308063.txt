    "in the context of galactic disc dynamics , there have been numerous investigations on criteria of axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric disc instabilities ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for a single disc of either gaseous or stellar content , safronov ( 1960 ) and toomre ( 1964 ) originally derived a dimensionless @xmath8 parameter to determine the local stability ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) against axisymmetric ring - like disturbances . besides a massive dark matter halo ,",
    "a more realistic disc galaxy involves both gas and stars .",
    "it is thus sensible to consider a composite system of one gas disc and one stellar disc under the gravitational control of the dark matter halo .",
    "theoretical studies on this type of two - component disc systems were extensive in the past ( lin & shu 1966 , 1968 ; kato 1972 ; jog & solomon 1984a , b ; bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo 1992 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; lou & fan 1998b , 2000a , b ) . in particular , it has been attempted to introduce proper definitions of an effective @xmath8 parameter relevant to a composite disc system for the criterion of local axisymmetric instabilities ( elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; lou & fan 1998b ) .",
    "the results of such a stability analysis may provide a basis for understanding composite disc dynamics ( e.g. lou & fan 2000a , b ; lou & shen 2003 ) and for estimating global star formation rate in a disc galaxy ( e.g. , kennicutt 1989 ; silk 1997 ) .",
    "there are several reasons that lead us to once again look into this axisymmetric stability problem .",
    "a few years ago , shu , laughlin , lizano & galli ( 2000 ; see also galli et al . 2001 ) studied stationary coplanar perturbation structures in an isopedically magnetized singular isothermal disc ( sid ) without using the usual wkbj approximation .",
    "they found exact analytical solutions for stationary ( i.e. , zero pattern speed ) configurations of axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric logarithmic spiral perturbations . according to their analysis , for axisymmetric perturbations with radial propagation",
    ", a sid with sufficiently slow rotation speed will collapse for sufficiently large radial perturbation scales , while a sid with sufficiently fast rotation speed will be unstable to ring fragmentations for relatively small radial perturbation scales ( see fig . 2 of shu et al .",
    "2000 ) . for axisymmetric perturbations , the stable regime of sid rotation speed may be characterized by a dimensionless rotation parameter @xmath10 , which is the ratio of the constant sid rotation speed @xmath11 to the isothermal sound speed @xmath12 .",
    "the critical values of the lowest and the highest @xmath10 for axisymmetric stability can be derived from their marginal stability curves .",
    "shu et al . ( 2000 ) supported their interpretations by invoking the familiar toomre @xmath8 parameter , implying that a local wkbj analysis may still have some relevance or validity to global sid perturbation solutions . in their proposed scheme , shu et al . noted that the two critical values of @xmath10 are fairly close to @xmath13 for neutral stability .",
    "as they did not invoke the wkbj approximation in deriving the analytic perturbation solutions , the @xmath14criterion and the @xmath15criterion correspond to each other well with large wavenumber ( ring fragmentation ) , while the rough correspondence of the @xmath14criterion and the @xmath15criterion for small wavenumbers ( collapse ) is unexpected where the wkbj requirement is poorly met .    regarding astrophysical applications ,",
    "these basic properties of @xmath15criterion should be properly applied in contexts even at qualitative or conceptual levels .",
    "for example , for majority of currently observed disc galaxies , the typical rotation parameter @xmath10 may be sufficiently large to avoid the collapse regime , that is , these disc galaxies are rotationally supported .",
    "besides other instabilities , the ring fragmentation instability is conceptually pertinent to disc galaxies such as estimates of global star formation rates ( e.g. , jog & solomon 1984a ; kennicutt 1989 ; silk 1997 ; lou & fan 1998b , 2002a , b ) .",
    "having said these , we should add that the collapse regime of @xmath15criterion might be relevant in early stages of galactic disc evolution .",
    "that is , slow and fast disc rotations of proto - galaxies may be responsible for eventual bifurcations into different morphologies of galactic systems . furthermore , for central discs ( with radii less than a few kiloparsecs ) surrounding galactic nuclei with supermassive black holes ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1969 ) or for protostellar discs around central collapsed cores ( e.g. , shu 1977 ) , this @xmath10 parameter may be sufficiently small to induce disc collapses . therefore",
    ", both the collapse and ring - fragmentation regimes can be of considerable interest in various astrophysical applications .",
    "recently , we investigated coplanar perturbation configurations in a composite system of two gravitationally coupled stellar and gaseous sids , both taken to be razor thin ( lou & shen 2003 ) . in the ideal two - fluid formalism , we derived analytical solutions for stationary axisymmetric and logarithmic spiral configurations in a composite sid system in terms of a dimensionless rotation parameter @xmath2 for the stellar sid indicates the relevance to the stellar sid . ] . by the analogy of a single sid ( shu et al .",
    "2000 ) , these stationary configurations should form marginal stability curves ( see fig . 2 and more extensive results of lou & shen 2003 ) that separate the stable region from unstable  regions for axisymmetric disturbances .",
    "compared with the single sid case , the stable range of @xmath2 is reduced owing to the presence of an additional gaseous sid and can vary for different parameters .    in order to make convincing arguments for the above analogy and our physical interpretations , we perform here a time - dependent local stability analysis using the wkbj approximation for the composite sid system ( lou & shen 2003 ) . in a proper parameter regime , we demonstrate the correctness of interpretations by shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and in general , we clearly show the validity of using @xmath2 parameter to demark stable and unstable regimes .",
    "to place our analysis in relevant contexts , we also discuss how the two effective @xmath8 parameters of elmegreen ( 1995 ) and of jog ( 1996 ) are related to our @xmath2 parameter when other pertinent parameters are specified .    in section 2 ,",
    "we derive the time - dependent wkbj dispersion relation for the composite sid system and define several useful dimensionless parameters . in section 3 , we present the criterion for the sid system being stable against all axisymmetric disturbances . finally , our results are discussed and summarized in section 4 .",
    "here , we go through the basic fluid equations and derive the local dispersion relation in the wkbj approximation ( lin & shu 1964 ) . for physical variables ,",
    "we use either superscript or subscript @xmath16 for the stellar sid and @xmath17 for the gaseous sid . as both sids",
    "are assumed to have flat rotation curves with different speeds @xmath3 and @xmath18 , we express the mean angular rotation speeds of the two sids in the forms of @xmath19 where @xmath4 and @xmath20 are the velocity dispersion of the stellar sid and the isothermal sound speed in the gaseous sid , respectively .",
    "dimensionless rotation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath21 are defined as the ratios of stellar sid rotation speed to velocity dispersion and gaseous sid rotation speed to sound speed , respectively .",

    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 at the @xmath26 plane , are @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stellar surface mass density , @xmath31 is the radial component of the bulk fluid velocity , @xmath32 is the @xmath33component of the specific angular momentum , @xmath34 is the stellar velocity dispersion ( or an effective  isothermal sound speed \" ) , @xmath35 stands for an effective two - dimensional pressure in the polytropic approximation , and @xmath36 is the total gravitational potential perturbation . for the corresponding fluid equations in the gaseous disc , we simply replace the relevant superscript or subscript @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",

    "the stellar and gaseous sids interact mainly through the mutual gravity on large scales ( jog & solomon 1984a , b ; bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo 1992 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; lou & fan 1998b , 2000a , b ; lou & shen 2003 ) .    using the above equations for the steady background rotational equilibrium ( indicated by an explicit subscript @xmath39 ) with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43\\ , \\\\ \\sigma_0^g = a_g^2(1+d_g^2)\\delta/[2\\pi gr(1+\\delta)]\\ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and an important relation to @xmath44 is known , the rotation speeds of the composite sid system can be determined through that of the stellar disc , i.e. @xmath5 , as the two rotation speeds are coupled dynamically . in the limiting regime of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath3 and @xmath18",
    "are comparable with @xmath18 slightly larger by an amount of @xmath47 . in this sense",
    ", the assumption @xmath48 is reasonable . ]",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 is the sid surface mass density ratio , @xmath51 stands for the square of the ratio of the stellar velocity dispersion to the gas sound speed . in our analysis , we specify values @xmath6 and @xmath7 to characterize different composite sid systems",
    ". for late - type spiral galaxies , gas materials are less than the stellar mass with @xmath52 . for young proto disc galaxies",
    ", gas materials may exceed stellar mass in general with @xmath53 .",
    "thus , in our analysis and computations , both cases of @xmath52 and @xmath54 are considered .",

    "@xmath61 @xmath62 for the stellar sid , and the corresponding equations for the gaseous sid with subscript or superscript @xmath16 replaced by @xmath17 in equations ( 9)@xmath63(11 ) .",

    "we obtain the local wkbj dispersion relation for the composite sid system in the form of @xmath68 jog & solomon ( 1984a ) have previously derived the similar dispersion relation with @xmath69 and thus @xmath70 .",
    "the stability analyses of elmegreen ( 1995 ) and jog ( 1996 ) start with the same dispersion relation of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) .",
    "the wkbj approach of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) is generally applicable to any locally prescribed properties of a two - fluid disc system . in",
    "earlier theoretical studies including that of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) , it is usually taken that the rotation speeds of the two fluid discs are equal .",
    "our model of two coupled sids here is self consistent globally with a central singularity and with different sid rotation speeds in general .",
    "when one applies the local wkbj analysis to our composite sid system , the procedure is identical to that of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) but with different local sid speeds @xmath3 and @xmath18 and hence different epicyclic frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". therefore , our dispersion ( 13 ) appears strikingly similar to that of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) yet with different @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in short ,",
    "if one prescribes two different disc speeds and thus two different epicyclic frequencies in the analysis of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) , the resulting dispersion relation should be our equation ( 13 ) .    in our analysis ,",
    "the rotation speeds of the stellar and the gaseous sids differ in general . in particular",
    ", since @xmath71 is usually higher than @xmath44 , it follows from equations ( 1 ) and ( 8) that @xmath72 .",
    "that is , the stellar disc rotates somewhat slower than the gaseous disc does .",
    "such phenomena have been observed in the solar neighborhood as well as in external galaxies ( k. c. freeman , 2003 , private communications ) .",
    "this is related to the so - called _ asymmetric drift _ phenomena ( e.g. , mihalas & binney 1981 ) and can be understood in terms of the jeans equations ( jeans 1919 ) originally derived by maxwell from the collisionless boltzmann equation . in essence , random stellar velocity dispersions produce a pressure - like effect such that mean circular motions become slower ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in our treatment , this effect of stellar velocity dispersions is modelled in the polytropic approximation ( see eqns ( 2 ) and ( 8) ) .",
    "biermann & davis ( 1960 ) discussed the possibility that the mean rotation speeds of the stars and gas in the galaxy may be different and reached the opposite conclusion that a gas disc should rotate slower than a stellar disc does .",
    "however , their analysis based on a virial theorem that excludes the effect of stellar velocity dispersions . in other words ,",
    "the stress tensor due to stellar velocity dispersions in the jeans equation has been ignored in their considerations .",
    "we study the axisymmetric stability problem based on the wkbj dispersion relation . similar to previous analysis ( toomre 1964 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; lou & fan 1998b )",

    "we stress that ring fragmentation instabilities occurring at large wavenumbers are familiar in the usual local wkbj analysis ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) . while collapse instabilities at small wavenumbers are known recently for the sid system ( shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 ) .",
    "the physical nature of the new `` collapse '' regime is fundamentally due to the jeans instability when the radial perturbation scale becomes sufficiently large . and can be solved for a larger @xmath118 and a smaller @xmath118 corresponding to short- and long - wave branches respectively ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the former is naturally consistent with the wkbj approximation , while the latter , inconsistent with the wkbj approximation , turns out to be a necessary key ingredient in the swing process ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; toomre 1981 ; fan & lou 1997 ) as revealed by analytical and numerical analyses . in the end , one needs to perform global analyses to justify the wkbj hint for instabilities of relatively large scales .",
    "] by the conservation of angular momentum , sid rotation plays a stabilizing role to modify the onset of jeans collapse ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1961 ) . hence , there appears a critical @xmath5 below which exists the collapse regime .",
    "of course , too large a @xmath5 causes the other type of ring fragmentation instabilities to set in . for",
    "most disc galaxies currently observed , the rotation parameter @xmath5 is typically large enough to avoid such collapses .",
    "elsewhere , the collapse regime studied here may have relevant astrophysical applications , e.g. , in circumnuclear discs around nuclei of galaxies and protostellar discs around protostellar cores etc . , where @xmath5 may be small enough ( either a high velocity dispersion @xmath4 or a low rotation speed @xmath3 ) to initiate collapses during certain phases of disc system evolution .",
    "in fact , for a low rotation speed @xmath3 , we note from the perspective of evolution , that those proto disc galaxies of low rotation speeds in earlier epochs , will jeans collapse and lead to other morphologies , while those proto disc galaxies of sufficiently fast rotation speeds in earlier epochs will gradually evolve into disc galaxies we observe today .",
    "meanwhile , ring fragmentation instabilities are thought to be relevant to global star formation in a disc galaxy  another important aspect of galactic evolution .",
    "the addition of a gaseous sid to a stellar sid will decrease the overall stability against axisymmetric disturbances at any wavelengths in general , that is , the stable range of @xmath5 shrinks .",
    "however , for the two types of instabilities , namely , the collapse instability at small wavenumbers and the ring - fragmentation instability at relatively large wavenumbers , the gravitational coupling of the two sids play different roles .",
    "for instance , a composite sid system tends more likely to fall into ring fragmentations but less likely to collapse . for either larger @xmath6 or larger @xmath7",
    ", this tendency becomes more apparent .",
    "this trend can be understood physically .",
    "for the ring - fragmentation regime , suppose the stellar sid by itself alone is initially stable and a gaseous sid component is added to the stellar sid system in a dynamically consistent manner .",
    "the gaseous sid may be either stable or unstable by itself alone . by itself",
    ", the gaseous sid tends to be more unstable if the sound speed @xmath20 becomes smaller or @xmath88 becomes larger according to the definition of the @xmath8 parameter ( valid for the ring fragmentation instability ) , which means larger @xmath7 or larger @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thus , with either @xmath7 or @xmath6 or both being larger , a composite sid system tends to be more vulnerable to ring fragmentations .",
    "the interpretation for the collapse regime is associated with the dynamical coupling of surface mass density @xmath115 and epicyclic frequency @xmath116 that leads to the following conclusion , namely , a lower velocity dispersion of the gas component seems to prevent collapse .",
    "this should be understood from condition ( 8) : for larger @xmath7 , the rotation speed @xmath18 will exceeds @xmath3 by a larger margin and helps to prevent an overall sid collapse .",
    "as already noted , the wkbj approximation becomes worse in the quantitative sense when dealing with small wavenumbers where the collapse regime exists .",
    "but the stability properties of a sid can be qualitatively understood through the wkbj analysis .",
    "the exact perturbation analysis of our recent work ( lou & shen 2003 ) has shown that the collapse regime diminishes with increasing values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . therefore , once the interpretations are justified physically , the exact procedure of lou & shen ( 2003 ) should be adopted to identify the relevant stable range of @xmath5 of a composite sid . as much as shu",

    "we now discuss the wkbj results in the context of our own galaxy , the milky way , for which the necessary observational data are available , such as the gas fraction , the stellar and the gaseous velocity dispersions and the epicyclic frequency , and so forth .",
    "there are several inadequacies of our model .",
    "first , the isothermal assumption implying constant @xmath4 and @xmath20 throughout the disc system is a gross simplification ; the velocity dispersion @xmath4 in the milky way decreases with increasing radius ( e.g. , lewis & freeman 1989 ) .",
    "secondly , by the polytropic approximation , the surface mass densities are characterized by power - law @xmath0 profiles , which appear not to be the case of the milky way ( e.g. , caldwell & ostriker 1981 ) . nevertheless , to estimate local stability properties of a disc portion , we may take @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and flat rotation speed @xmath195 around @xmath197 from the center of our galaxy . for a massive dark matter halo",
    "such that @xmath191 , the relevant parameters to determine the effective @xmath8 parameter for a composite partial sid system are @xmath196 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath191 .",
    "following the definition of jog ( 1996 ) , the value of @xmath200 . while for full sids with @xmath190 , we get @xmath201 which means local instability",
    ". obviously , the dark matter halo plays the key role in stabilizing the system .",
    "the composite partial sid model with power - law @xmath202 surface mass densities may not describe the milky way well .",
    "but for those disc galaxies with flat rotation curves and approximate power - law @xmath202 surface mass densities , our model should offer a sensible local criterion for axisymmetric instability .",
    "for example , given radial variations of velocity dispersions and gas mass fraction , we may deduce locally unstable zones .    for circumnuclear discs around nuclei of galaxies",
    ", the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath4 can be as high as several hundred kilometers per second along the line of sight ( e.g. , whitmore et al .",
    "1985 ; mcelroy 1994 ) ; this may then lead to small @xmath5 .",
    "within such a parameter regime , the collapse instability may set in during a certain phase of system evolution .",
    "for instance , in the case of fig .",
    "2 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we choose @xmath203 and @xmath204 in a circumnuclear disc region of a disc galaxy",
    ". the resulting @xmath205 would give rise to collapse and the composite sid system might eventually evolve into a bulge of high velocity dispersion .",
    "another possible collapse situation of interest corresponds to small @xmath5 for sufficiently low disc rotation speed @xmath11 .",
    "potential applications include but not limited to protostellar discs in the context of star formation .",
    "we here briefly discuss several qualitative aspects .",
    "for a protostellar disc system , the two disc components here may be identified with the relatively  hot \" gas disc and the relatively  cool \" dust disc .",
    "interactions of radiation fields from the central protostar with cool dusts in the disc lead to infrared emissions . in our idealized treatment ,",
    "the gas and dust discs are treated as two gravitationally coupled thin sids .",
    "this simple model treatment may need to be complemented by other processes of coupling such as collisions between gas and dust particles .",
    "when such a composite disc system rotates at a low speed ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1987 ) , the rotation parameter @xmath10 could be low enough to initiate large - scale collapse .",
    "the subsequent dynamical processes will drive the composite sid system to more violent star formation activities .",
    "so far we have investigated the axisymmetric stability problem for a composite system of gravitationally coupled stellar and gaseous sids using the wkbj approximation and we now summarize the results of our analysis .",
    "first , because the single sid case studied by shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) may be regarded as the special case of a composite sid system , the results of our wkbj analysis clearly support the physical interpretations of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the marginal stability curves of axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the  ring fragmentation regime \" is related to the familiar @xmath8 parameter ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) .",
    "the presence of the jeans  collapse regime \" can be traced to the sid model where self - gravity , effective pressure , and sid rotation compete with each other .",
    "secondly , the recent study of lou & shen ( 2003 ) generalizes that of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and describes exact perturbation solutions in a composite sid system .",
    "we obtained marginal stability curves for axisymmetric perturbations that are qualitatively similar to those of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and that depend on additional dimensionless parameters .",
    "it is natural to extend the interpretations of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . through the wkbj analysis here , we now firmly establish the presence of two regimes of  ring fragmentation \" and  collapse \" in a composite sid system .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to apply our exact @xmath15criterion for a composite sid system , not only for disc galaxies , but also for other disc systems including circumnuclear discs and protostellar discs etc .",
    "thirdly , in the wkbj approximation , it is also possible to relate our @xmath15criterion to the @xmath119 criterion similar to that of elmegreen ( 1995 ) .",
    "because @xmath23 and @xmath24 are different in general , our wkbj treatment is not the same as that of elmegreen ( 1995 ) .",
    "fourthly , also in the wkbj approximation , we relate our @xmath15criterion to the @xmath120 criterion as defined by jog ( 1996 ) but with @xmath129 in general .",
    "we find that the @xmath120 criterion is fairly robust in the wkbj regime .",
    "finally , we further consider the axisymmetric stability of a composite partial sid system to include the gravitational effect from an axisymmetric dark matter halo .",
