    "recent solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor ( kamland @xcite and chooz @xcite ) and accelerator ( k2k @xcite ) neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed . in the framework of three lepton families , the phenomena of flavor mixing and cp violation are described by a @xmath0 unitary matrix @xmath1 , which relates the mass eigenstates of three neutrinos @xmath2 to their flavor eigenstates @xmath3 : @xmath4 no matter whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles , leptonic cp and t violation in normal neutrino - neutrino or antineutrino - antineutrino oscillations depends only upon a single rephasing - invariant parameter @xmath5 @xcite , defined through @xmath6 where greek and latin subscripts run respectively over @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a challenging task of the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is to measure @xmath5 , so as to establish the existence of cp violation in the lepton sector . in principle , a determination of @xmath5 is also possible from four independent moduli @xmath9 @xcite , whose magnitudes can be measured in some cp - conserving processes .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath1 implies that its nine matrix elements are constrained by two sets of normalization conditions and two sets of orthogonality relations : @xmath10 the six orthogonality relations define six triangles in the complex plane , as first discussed in ref .",
    "six unitarity triangles have 18 different sides and 9 different inner angles , but their areas are all identical to @xmath11 .",
    "so far , some particular attention has been paid to triangles @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite shown in fig . 1 .",
    "because current experimental data indicate that @xmath1 has a nearly bi - maximal mixing pattern with @xmath14 , one can easily observe that three sides of @xmath12 are comparable in magnitude ; i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "it is therefore possible to establish @xmath12 and determine its three angles @xcite , once its three sides are measured to an acceptable degree of accuracy .",
    "in contrast , one side of @xmath13 is much shorter than its other two sides ; i.e. , @xmath16 . to establish",
    "@xmath13 needs much more precise data on its three sides , which must be able to show @xmath17 or latexmath:[$|v_{e2 } v^*_{\\mu 2}| + |v_{e3 } v^*_{\\mu 3}| >    practically impossible to be satisfied in the near future @xcite .    to measure @xmath5 and @xmath9 in realistic long - baseline experiments of neutrino oscillations , the terrestrial matter effects",
    "must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in matter can be expressed in the same form as those in vacuum , however , if we define the _ effective _ neutrino masses @xmath19 and the _ effective _ lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath20 in which the terrestrial matter effects are already included @xcite . in analogy to the definition of @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the _ effective _ cp - violating parameter @xmath21 in matter can be defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 run respectively over @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "one may similarly define the unitarity triangles in matter with the help of the unitarity conditions @xmath25 for example , the _ effective _ counterparts of triangles @xmath12 and @xmath13 are denoted respectively by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . because of the terrestrial matter effects , the shapes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are likely to be dramatically different from those of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is then possible to have latexmath:[$|\\tilde{v}_{e1 } \\tilde{v}^*_{\\mu 1}| \\sim     neutrino beam energy .",
    "if this speculation is really true , one will be able to calculate @xmath21 by using three sides of @xmath27 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to carry out a systematic analysis of leptonic unitarity triangles in matter .",
    "we shall derive the exact analytical relations between @xmath33 and @xmath34 for a constant matter density profile .",
    "the sides of @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) can then be linked to those of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the inner angles of @xmath35 and @xmath37 will also be calculated in terms of the inner angles of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , we shall discuss the matter - modified rephasing invariants of @xmath1 ( such as @xmath21 and the off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath20 ) and illustrate the typical shape changes of @xmath35 and @xmath37 with the neutrino beam energy in a long - baseline experiment .",
    "our results are expected to be very useful for a complete study of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation in the era of precision measurements .",
    "the remaining parts of this article are organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the master formulas to derive @xmath19 and @xmath20 in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath1 .",
    "section iii is devoted to the calculation of @xmath34 .",
    "the analytical relations between the inner angles of @xmath35 ( or @xmath37 ) and @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) are presented in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to illustrating the shape evolution of @xmath35 and @xmath37 with the matter density .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section vi .",

    ", we have assumed that the matter density profile is constant ( namely , @xmath49 constant ) . such an assumption is actually close to reality for most of the proposed terrestrial long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite . in order to establish the analytical relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we define two quantities @xmath52 in vacuum and their effective counterparts @xmath53 in matter @xcite , where the subscripts @xmath54 and @xmath55 run over @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the determinants of @xmath59 and @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) are simply @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in terms of @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 )",
    ", one can obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 although the exact analytical relations between @xmath50 and @xmath51 have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , they are not simple enough to calculate @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) , which are directly relevant to the leptonic unitarity triangles in matter",
    ". hence we shall establish the relations between @xmath68 and @xmath70 in a different and simpler way .",
    "our strategy is as follows : first , we express @xmath70 in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath68 in terms of @xmath72 ; second , we find out the relationship between @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; finally , we derive the direct relations between @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) allow us to express @xmath70 in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath68 in terms of @xmath72 .",
    "to see this point more clearly , we introduce the coefficient matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 because three neutrino masses are not exactly degenerate , the inverse matrices of @xmath73 and @xmath74 exist .",
    "then one can obtain @xmath76 taking account of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we find that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are connected with each other through @xmath77 where @xmath78 . a combination of eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) will lead to the direct relations between @xmath68 and @xmath70 , as one can see in the subsequent sections .",
    "the usefulness of eqs .",
    "( 10)(14 ) for discussing the matter - induced properties of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation has partly shown up in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and will be further demonstrated in the following .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the generic results obtained above are only valid for neutrinos propagating in vacuum and in matter . as for antineutrinos",
    ", the corresponding formulas can straightforwardly be written out from eqs .",
    "( 6)(14 ) through the replacements @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we first derive the relations between @xmath34 and @xmath33 by taking @xmath81 for eq .",
    "( 14 ) is taken into account , we may concretely obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , the inverse matrix of @xmath74 reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 . with the help of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) as well as the relationship @xcite @xmath87 we solve eq . ( 15 ) and arrive at @xmath88 and @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 in appendix a , we list the explicit expressions of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in terms of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it is then possible to evaluate the deviation of @xmath34 from @xmath33 by using the formulas obtained above .",
    "of course , @xmath98 holds at the limit @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "two sets of normalization conditions given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) allow us to define two off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath20 : @xmath101 they can straightforwardly be calculated by using eqs . (",
    "19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) . comparing between @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) and its counterpart @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) in vacuum",
    ", we may examine the matter effect on the geometric structure of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the six matter - modified unitarity triangles will reduce to three pairs of _ congruent _ triangles @xcite , if @xmath106 or @xmath107 holds .",
    "the sides of six unitarity triangles can also be obtained from eqs .",
    "( 19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "if three sides of a specific triangle are comparable in magnitude , one may use them to calculate the area of this triangle ",
    "namely , the cp - violating invariant @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , @xmath21 is given by @xmath108 in which @xmath109 running over @xmath7 and @xmath110 running over @xmath111 .",
    "the implication of this result is obvious : important information about leptonic cp violation can in principle be extracted from the measured moduli of four independent matrix elements of @xmath20 .",
    "now let us focus our attention on the inner angles of six unitarity triangles .",
    "there are only 9 independent angles , which appear either in triangles @xmath112 or in triangles @xmath113 ( see fig . 1 for illustration ) .",
    "hence it is only necessary to consider @xmath114 and their effective counterparts @xmath115 in the calculation of 9 angles . to be specific , an inner angle of @xmath116 or @xmath117 ( for @xmath118 or @xmath58 )",
    "can be defined as @xmath119 where @xmath120 run over @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and @xmath124 run over @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "taking account of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , we obtain @xmath128 note that @xmath129 and @xmath21 are related with each other through the equation @xcite @xmath130 in order to link @xmath131 to @xmath132 via eq .",
    "( 26 ) , we need to find out the relationship between @xmath133 and @xmath134 .    for @xmath109 , eqs .",

    "( 16 ) . with the help of eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , one may solve eq .",
    "( 28 ) and obtain the matter - induced corrections to @xmath64 .",
    "three sides of the effective unitarity triangle @xmath136 , @xmath137 or @xmath138 are then given by @xmath139 for @xmath138 ; and @xmath140 for @xmath137 ; and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "it is remarkable that eq .",
    "( 29 ) , ( 30 ) or ( 31 ) , together with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , can be used to derive eq .",
    "the relationship between @xmath133 and @xmath134 can also be derived from these equations .",
    "then we are able to establish the direct connection between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "comparing between the definition of @xmath143 and the simpler notation of nine inner angles in fig . 1 , we have @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 ; @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ; @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "one may use the similar notation ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) to replace @xmath156 for the matter - modified unitarity triangles .",
    "therefore , @xmath157 and @xmath158 and @xmath159 these exact analytical results clearly show how nine inner angles of six unitarity triangles get modified by the matter effects .",
    "we proceed to numerically illustrate the matter effects on the shapes of six unitarity triangles , the rephasing invariant of cp violation , and the off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath1 . in view of current solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrino oscillation data , we typically take @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "we also take @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the standard parametrization of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is unnecessary to specify two majorana - type cp - violating phases of @xmath1 in our calculations , because they play no role in the configuration of leptonic unitarity triangles @xcite . the inputs taken above lead to @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "this means that @xmath1 is asymmetric both about its @xmath169-@xmath170-@xmath171 axis and about its @xmath172-@xmath170-@xmath173 axis , and the area of each triangle is about 8 times smaller than its maximal limit ( i.e. , @xmath174 @xcite ) .    for a realistic long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ,",
    "the dependence of terrestrial matter effects on the neutrino beam energy can approximately be written as @xmath175 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this approximation is reasonably good and close to reality , only if the baseline length is about 1000 km or shorter @xcite . of course",
    ", @xmath176 holds in the limit of @xmath177 or @xmath178 . typically taking @xmath179 gev , 2 gev and 3 gev",
    ", we calculate the sides of six effective unitarity triangles in matter and show the changes of their shapes in figs .",
    "the corresponding results for 9 inner angles of @xmath180 or @xmath181 are presented in table 1 , and the numerical dependence of @xmath21 , @xmath102 and @xmath182 on @xmath44 is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 . some comments and discussions are in order .",
    "\\(a ) the smallness of @xmath183 ( or @xmath184 ) makes one side of @xmath185 or @xmath186 strongly suppressed .",
    "when the terrestrial matter effect with @xmath187 gev is taken into account , three sides of @xmath188 and @xmath26 become comparable in magnitude for neutrinos ( @xmath189 and @xmath1 ) ; or three sides of @xmath190 and @xmath26 become comparable in magnitude for antineutrinos ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 ) . as a consequence of matter corrections , the shortest side of @xmath186 ( i.e. , @xmath193 at @xmath178 ) turns out to be shorter for neutrinos",
    "; so does that of @xmath185 ( i.e. , @xmath194 at @xmath178 ) for antineutrinos .",
    "we find that the shape of @xmath26 is relatively stable against matter corrections , no matter whether the neutrino beam or the antineutrino beam is concerned .",
    "\\(b ) similarly because of the smallness of @xmath183 ( or @xmath184 ) , one side of @xmath195 or @xmath13 is strongly suppressed .",
    "the terrestrial matter effect becomes significant for @xmath187 gev . in this case , three sides of @xmath196 and @xmath27 are comparable in magnitude for either neutrinos ( @xmath189 and @xmath1 ) or antineutrinos ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 )",
    ". an interesting feature of @xmath142 is that its side @xmath197 may significantly be suppressed by matter effects for antineutrinos .",
    "one can see that the shapes of @xmath196 and @xmath27 are relatively stable against matter corrections , no matter whether the neutrino beam or the antineutrino beam is concerned .",
    "\\(c ) note that the input @xmath163 , which is well favored by current atmospheric neutrino oscillation data @xcite , results in @xmath198 ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "hence triangles @xmath195 and @xmath13 are congruent with each other ; so are their effective counterparts @xmath196 and @xmath27 .",
    "this accidental result has actually shown up in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "from the phenomenological point of view , it makes sense to measure @xmath199 accurately and to examine its possible deviation from maximal mixing ( i.e. , @xmath200 exactly ) , so as to explore the underlying @xmath57-@xmath58 flavor symmetry and its geometric manifestation in leptonic unitarity triangles .",
    "\\(d ) table 1 is helpful for us to understand the terrestrial matter effect on 9 inner angles of six unitarity triangles .",
    "one can see that @xmath201 and @xmath202 , which happen to be identical as a consequence of @xmath163 , are relatively stable against matter corrections . in contrast ,",
    "@xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 are rather sensitive to matter corrections .",
    "\\(e ) no matter how the sides and angles of six unitarity triangles change with the matter effect , their area ( @xmath206 ) is in most cases smaller than that in vacuum ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this unfortunate feature , as shown in fig . 6 , makes it hard to directly measure leptonic cp or t violation in any realistic long - baseline neutrino oscillations .",
    "if the neutrino beam energy is small ( e.g. , about 1 gev or smaller ) , the matter - induced suppression of @xmath5 is not significant . in this case , a study of leptonic cp violation and unitarity triangles in a _",
    "medium_-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment seems more feasible @xcite .",
    "\\(f ) the matter effect on two off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath1 is also illustrated in fig . 6 .",
    "one can see that @xmath207 is a good approximation , when the beam energy of antineutrinos satisfies @xmath187 gev . in this interesting case ,",
    "one may approximately arrive at @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "such a result can also be seen from figs . 3 and 5 . the possibility for @xmath211 may appear only when the beam energy of neutrinos is around @xmath212 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "these results are certainly dependent upon our inputs .",
    "therefore , they mainly serve for illustration .    in practice , the reconstruction of a unitarity triangle requires a series of measurements , which can be done in both _ appearance _ and _ disappearance _ neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "more detailed analyses in this respect can be seen from ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the central attention has only been paid to the triangle @xmath13 and its effective counterpart @xmath27 . a similar analysis of other triangles",
    "is expected to be very lengthy and will be presented elsewhere @xcite . as we have emphasized , it is possible to establish leptonic cp violation by means of the precise experimental information about the sides of six unitarity triangles . in this sense , the geometric approach described here may be complimentary to the direct determination of cp violation from the measurement of probability asymmetries between @xmath213 and @xmath214 ( for @xmath109 running over @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) oscillations .",
    "considering the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath1 and its effective counterpart @xmath20 in matter , we have carried out a systematic analysis of their corresponding unitarity triangles in the complex plane .",
    "the exact analytical relations between the moduli @xmath9 and @xmath215 have been derived .",
    "the sides and angles of each unitarity triangle have also been calculated by taking account of the terrestrial matter effect .",
    "we have illustrated the shape evolution of six effective triangles with the beam energy of neutrinos and antineutrinos in a realistic long - baseline oscillation experiment .",
    "matter corrections to the rephasing - invariant parameter of cp violation and the off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath1 have been discussed too .",
    "we expect that this complete geometric description of matter - modified lepton flavor mixing and cp violation will be very useful for the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , although it remains unclear how far our experimentalists will go in this direction .",
    "we admit that how to experimentally realize the proposed ideas and methods is certainly a challenging question . however , it is absolutely clear that the measurement of leptonic cp violation must be a top task of experimental neutrino physics in the coming years or even decades .",
    "let us recall what has happened in the quark sector : cp violation and one unitarity triangle ( defined by @xmath216 in the complex plane ) have been established at kek-@xmath217 and slac-@xmath217 factories , and a further study of other five triangles will be implemented at lhc-@xmath217 in the near future .",
    "thus we are convinced that similar steps will be taken for an experimental determination of leptonic cp violation and unitarity triangles in the era of _ precision _ neutrino physics .        in the assumption of a constant earth density profile and with the help of the effective hamiltonians given in eq .",
