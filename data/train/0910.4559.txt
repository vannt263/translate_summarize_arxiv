    "therefore the wald curvature @xmath256 associated with the chosen quadruple @xmath257 is @xmath258 this result gives an approximation of the total curvature of the wavefront surface under the assumption that locally this surface may be identified with a hyperbolic plane in which the quadruple considered is isometrically embedded .      in this subsection",
    "we present an outline of the construction of the method we used above to obtain the wald curvature corresponding to four receiving stations located at points @xmath182 and the arrival time differences @xmath259 :    1 .",

    "the ray tracing numerical method provides a useful tool for the description of spacelike bidimensional wavefronts within the framework of the general relativity .",
    "we have studied a method , based on techniques of computational geometry , that allows to estimate the curvature properties of the surface by making a least - squares fitting of the wavefront surface by a quadric surface in the neighborhood of each point of this surface .",
    "the computation of the light rays is carried out using an algorithm based on the taylor method for the solution of differential equations and employing high arithmetic precision .",
    "further , we have applied a projection at each step of the numerical integration process that allows to guarantee the fulfillment ( at machine precision ) of the isotropy condition for the tangent vector to the light ray .",
    "we have also studied numerically the dependence of the curvature properties of the wavefront surface on the value of the eddington parameter @xmath101 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have employed a geometric computational approach to the study of the model proposed by samuel as a new general relativity test , by determining a numerical approximation of the volume corresponding to a tetrahedron formed by four points on the wavefront that reaches four receiving stations on the earth surface .",
    "finally , we have obtained an estimation of the wald curvature for the wavefront in a vicinity of the earth by using the differences of arrival time recorded at four receiving stations on the earth .",
