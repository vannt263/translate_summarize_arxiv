    "how well do we understand the itinerant ferromagnetism of iron , nickel , and other transition metals and their compounds ?",
    "more than 50  years ago two basically different scenarios had emerged from early quantum - mechanical considerations on electrons in metals with partly filled @xmath3  bands . in scenario",
    "i , suggested by slater  @xcite and stoner  @xcite , band theory alone was proposed to account for itinerant ferromagnetism : due to the pauli principle , electrons with parallel spins can not come arbitrarily close to each other ( `` pauli '' or `` exchange hole '' ) , and , thus , a ferromagnetic alignment of the electron spins reduces the total coulomb energy with respect to the paramagnetic situation ( `` exchange energy '' ) .",
    "this scenario , equivalent to hartree - fock theory , was criticized by van vleck  @xcite . in an independent - electron theory",
    "electrons are distributed statistically over the lattice which implies strong charge fluctuations on the transition metal atoms .",
    "consequently , as a scenario  ii , van vleck  @xcite emphasized the importance of electron correlations : due to the strong electron - electron interactions , charge fluctuations in the atomic @xmath3  shells are strongly suppressed ( `` minimum polarity model '' ) , and , thus , atomic rather than band aspects are decisive for itinerant ferromagnetism . in scenario",
    "ii , the atomic magnetic moments arise due to the local coulomb interaction ( in particular , hunds - rule couplings ) , and they may align because of the electrons motion through the crystal .    in principle , such a dispute can be resolved in natural sciences .",
    "the corresponding theories have to be worked out in detail , and their results and predictions have to be compared to experiments .",
    "this was indeed done for scenario  i  @xcite .",
    "the ( spin-)density functional theory is a refined band theory which describes simple metals with considerable success .",
    "unfortunately , progress for scenario  ii was much slower .",
    "it calls for a theory of correlated electrons , i.e. , a genuine many - body problem has to be solved .",
    "it was only recently that reliable theoretical tools became available which allow to elucidate scenario  ii in more detail  @xcite .    a first step in this direction was the formulation of appropriate model hamiltonians which allowed to discuss matters concisely . in 1963/1964 gutzwiller  @xcite , hubbard  @xcite , and kanamori",
    "@xcite independently introduced the hubbard model which since then has become the standard model for correlated electrons on a lattice .",
    "this model covers both aspects of @xmath3  electrons on a lattice : they can move through the crystal , and they strongly interact when they sit on the same lattice site . the model is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ hubbardmodel ] .    even nowadays , it is impossible to calculate exact ground - state properties of such a model in three dimensions . in 1963/1964",
    "gutzwiller introduced a trial state to examine variationally the possibility of ferromagnetism in such a model  @xcite .",
    "his wave function covers both limits of weak and strong correlations and should , therefore , be suitable to provide qualitative insights into the magnetic phase diagram of the hubbard model .",
    "gutzwiller - correlated wave functions for multi - band hubbard models are defined and analyzed in sec .",
    "[ gwf ] .",
    "as envisaged by van vleck  @xcite , gutzwiller  @xcite found that ferromagnetism is non - generic in the one - band hubbard model , in contrast to the predictions of the stoner theory .",
    "the reason is simple : the gutzwiller wave function not only describes the exchange hole between electrons of the same spin species but also the `` correlation hole '' between electrons of different spin species which forms when the electron - electron interaction is taken into account consistently .",
    "therefore , the energy difference between the correlated paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states is very small , and paramagnetism wins in almost all one - band cases . in the multi - band situation",
    "@xcite , itinerant ferromagnetism is favored by two concomitant effects : ( i )  the suppression of atomic charge fluctuations such that , ( ii ) , the local exchange interactions give rise to a local magnetic moment as in isolated atoms ( hund s rule ) .",
    "hence , as proposed by van  vleck , small charge fluctuations _ and _ local exchange interactions generate large local moments which are present in both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases . at low temperatures the electrons motion through the crystal",
    "may then lead to long - range order of these pre - formed local moments . in this way",
    ", gutzwiller s approach unified and substantiated van  vleck s early ideas on a correlated - electron theory of itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "unfortunately , the evaluation of multi - band gutzwiller wave functions itself poses a most difficult many - body problem .",
    "perturbative treatments  @xcite are constrained to small to moderate interaction strengths .",
    "the region of strong correlations could only be addressed within the `` gutzwiller approximation ''  @xcite and its various extensions  @xcite .",
    "thus , an application to ferromagnetism of real materials was not in sight , and gutzwiller s qualitative findings were not appreciated much in the sixties .",
    "about 25  years later , a major technical advancement opened a new way to analyze gutzwiller - correlated wave functions .",
    "the one - band gutzwiller wave function was evaluated exactly in one dimension  @xcite , and the gutzwiller approximation was found to become exact for the one - band gutzwiller wave function in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "based on a diagrammatical approach , gebhard  @xcite developed a compact formalism which allows to calculate the variational ground - state energy in infinite dimensions without the evaluation of a single diagram .",
    "he found that @xmath5  corrections are quantitatively small for the gutzwiller wave function , i.e. , the result in infinite dimensions is a reliable approximation to three dimensions .",
    "recently , gebhard s approach was generalized by us to the case of multi - band gutzwiller wave functions  @xcite .",
    "thereby , earlier results by bnemann and weber  @xcite , based on a generic extension of the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite , were found to become exact in infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "half a century after van vleck s call for new many - particle methods and more than thirty years after gutzwiller s first paper on the subject , techniques are at hand to carry out the program outlined above as scenario  ii .    our results on a two - band toy model in sect .",
    "[ toymodel ] confirm gutzwiller s insights on the fundamental requirements for itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "substantial atomic coulomb interactions suppress local charge fluctuations and thereby allow the generation of local moments due to the atomic hunds - rule exchange couplings . our quantitative results from a full - scale calculation for nickel in sect .",
    "[ nickel ] confirm these qualitative findings .",
    "the quasi - particle properties of this material ( e.g. , exchange splittings , density of states , topology of the fermi surface ) are reproduced quantitatively from our gutzwiller - correlated wave functions .",
    "in particular , strong electron correlations are required to describe nickel appropriately .    in sect .",
    "[ spinwave ] , we briefly discuss a new method to calculate spinwave spectra of correlated electron systems based on the gutzwiller variational scheme  @xcite . in this way , the dispersion relation of the fundamental low - energy excitations can be derived consistently . albeit the description is based on itinerant electrons , the results for strong ferromagnetism in a generic two - band model resemble those of a heisenberg model for localized spins .",
    "again , the gutzwiller approach provides a comprehensive scheme for a unified description of localized and itinerant aspects of transition metals .    in this brief review",
    "we skip all technical details and refer the reader to the original literature for further information .",
    "our multi - band hubbard model  @xcite is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath6 here , @xmath7 creates an electron with combined spin - orbit index  @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for 3@xmath3  electrons ) at the lattice site  @xmath10 of a solid .",
    "the most general case is treated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we assume for simplicity that different types of orbitals belong to different representations of the point group of the respective atomic state ( e.g. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . in this case ,",
    "different types of orbitals do not mix locally , and , thus , the crystal field is of the from @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , we use normalized single - particle product states @xmath16 which respect the symmetry of the lattice , i.e. , @xmath17 we further assume that the local interaction is site - independent @xmath18 this term represents all possible local coulomb interactions .    as our basis for the atomic problem",
    "we choose the configuration states @xmath19 which are the `` slater determinants '' in atomic physics .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian  @xmath20 is a standard exercise  @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates  @xmath21 obey @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the elements of the unitary matrix which diagonalizes the atomic hamiltonian matrix with entries @xmath24 .",
    "then , @xmath25 the atomic properties , i.e. , eigenenergies @xmath26 , eigenstates  @xmath21 , and matrix elements  @xmath27 , are essential ingredients of our solid - state theory .",
    "gutzwiller - correlated wave functions are written as a many - particle correlator  @xmath28 acting on a normalized single - particle product state  @xmath29 , @xmath30 the single - particle wave function @xmath16 contains many configurations which are energetically unfavorable with respect to the atomic interactions .",
    "hence , the correlator  @xmath28 is chosen to suppress the weight of these configurations to minimize the total energy in  ( [ 1 ] ) . in the limit of strong correlations",
    "the gutzwiller correlator  @xmath28 should project onto atomic eigenstates .",
    "therefore , the proper multi - band gutzwiller wave function with atomic correlations reads @xmath31   \\label{gutzcorrdegbandshund } \\\\ % & = & 1+\\sum_{\\gamma }   \\left ( \\lambda_{i;\\gamma}-1\\right ) \\hat{m}_{i;\\gamma } \\;.",

    "therefore , by construction , @xmath37 covers both limits of weak and strong coupling . in this way it incorporates both itinerant and local aspects of correlated electrons in narrow - band systems .",
    "the class of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions as specified in  ( [ gutzcorrdegbandshund ] ) was evaluated exactly in the limit of infinite dimensions in ref .",
    "the expectation value of the hamiltonian  ( [ 1 ] ) reads @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the local particle density in @xmath40 .",

    "it is seen that the variational ground - state energy can be cast into the form of the expectation value of an effective single - particle hamiltonian with renormalized electron transfer amplitudes @xmath59 , @xmath60 therefore , @xmath16 is the ground state of @xmath61 whose parameters have to be determined self - consistently from the minimization of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath58 . for the optimum set of parameters , @xmath63 _",

    "we assume that the model describes two degenerate @xmath13 orbitals which leads to the following restrictions enforced by the cubic symmetry  @xcite : ( i )  @xmath67 , and ( ii )  @xmath68 . therefore , there are two independent coulomb parameters , the local coulomb repulsion @xmath69 and the local exchange coupling  @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath71 are of the same order of magnitude the relation  ( ii ) shows that @xmath72 is of the typical strength of the atomic hund s rule couplings .",
    "for the one - particle part  @xmath73 we use an orthogonal tight - binding hamiltonian with first and second nearest neighbor hopping matrix elements .",
    "we apply the two - center approximation for the hopping matrix elements and exclude any spin - flip hopping .",
    "the resulting band structure ( width  @xmath74 ) is discussed in detail in ref .",

    "of all the iron group magnetic metals , nickel is the most celebrated case of discrepancies between the results from experiment and from sdft . from very early on",

    "furthermore , very detailed photo - emission studies at symmetry points and along symmetry lines of the brillouin zone show discrepancies to sdft results for individual band - state energies which are of similar magnitude as seen in the overall @xmath3  bandwidth .",
    "the studies also revealed even bigger discrepancies in the exchange splittings of majority spin and minority spin bands .",
    "the sdft results give a rather isotropic exchange splitting of about @xmath91  @xcite .",

    "the much larger and much too isotropic exchange splitting of the sdft results has further consequences .",
    "1 .   the experimental magnetic moment of the strong ferromagnet ni is @xmath98 ; yet of relevance is its spin - only part @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "the sdft result is @xmath100  @xcite , an overestimate related to the too large exchange splitting .",
    "2 .   the @xmath93  state of the minority spin bands lies below @xmath101  @xcite , whereas all sdft results predict it to lie above the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the sdft fermi surface exhibits _ two _ hole ellipsoids around the @xmath102 point of the brillouin zone while in the de - haas ",
    "van - alphen experiments only _ one _ ellipsoid has been found  @xcite .",
    "the strong @xmath103-@xmath104 anisotropy is also reflected in the total @xmath3  hole spin density , i.e. , in the observation that the @xmath3-hole part of the ni magnetic moment has 81% @xmath14 and 19% @xmath13 character  @xcite , while the sdft results give a ratio of 74% to 26%  @xcite .    in the late 70 s and early 80 s various authors have investigated in how far many - body effects improve the agreement between theory and experiment , see , e.g. , refs .",

    "there , however , the quasi - particle linewidths have increased to @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively  @xcite , so that an exchange splitting near the bottom of the @xmath3 bands could , so far , not be observed experimentally . when we investigate the quasi - particle energies in the middle of the @xmath3 bands , such as @xmath171 , @xmath172 , or @xmath173 , we observe that our theoretical values lie consistently below the experimental ones . if we assume that these states can be measured more reliably than those near the bottom of the @xmath3  band , we may conclude that the value of @xmath110 could still be somewhat bigger than @xmath174 .",

    "the @xmath104  states have @xmath176 to nearest neighbors , and @xmath177 to next - nearest neighbors ; the latter are small because of the large lattice distance to second neighbors",
    ". the @xmath104  states also mix with the nearest - neighbor @xmath103  states with @xmath178-type coupling .",
    "therefore , the system can gain more band energy by avoiding occupation of anti - bonding @xmath103  states in the minority spin bands via large values of @xmath135 , at the expense of allowing occupation of less anti - bonding @xmath104 states via small @xmath134  values .",
    "note that this scenario is special to nickel and should not apply to materials with a bcc lattice structure which have almost equal nearest and next - nearest neighbor separations . since the bands in nickel are almost completely filled , the suppression of charge fluctuations actually reduces the number of atomic configurations where the hunds - rule coupling is active .",
    "it is also in this respect that nickel does not quite reflect the generic situation of other transition metals with less completely filled @xmath3  bands ; see sect .",
    "[ toymodel ] .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiments on nickel shows that our multi - band gutzwiller theory is a useful tool for the theoretical description of the ground - state properties of transition metals and their compounds . in the next section",
    "we describe a way to calculate consistently low - energy excitations in itinerant ferromagnets within our variational approach .",
    "as in magnetic insulators , the elementary excitations in itinerant ferromagnets are spinwaves . since ground - state properties are well described by gutzwiller - correlated wave functions it is highly desirable to derive spinwave dispersions from the same variational approach .",
    "in fact , the variational principle can also be used to calculate excited states  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath179 is the ferromagnetic , exact ground state with energy @xmath180 , the trial states @xmath181 are necessarily orthogonal to @xmath179 , and provide an exact upper bound to the first excited state with momentum  @xmath41 and energy @xmath182 @xmath183 here , @xmath184 flips a spin from up to down in the system whereby it changes the total momentum of the system by  @xmath41 .",
    "in this way , the famous bijl - feynman formula for the phonon - roton dispersion in superfluid helium was derived  @xcite . in the case of ferromagnetism",
    "the excitation energies  @xmath185 can be identified with the spinwave dispersion if a well - defined spinwave exists at all  @xcite .",
    "experimentally this criterion is fulfilled for small momenta  @xmath41 and energies  @xmath185 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the exact ground state or its energy in general .",
    "however , we may hope that the gutzwiller wave function  @xmath37 is a good approximation to the true ground state .",
    "then , the states @xmath186 will provide a reliable estimate for @xmath185 , @xmath187 naturally , @xmath188 does not obey any strict upper - bound principles",
    ".    the hamiltonian  ( [ 1 ] ) commutes with the operator for the total spin .",
    "thus , for @xmath189 , @xmath190 generates a state from the same spin multiplet .",
    "therefore , the spinwave at zero momentum is the goldstone mode of the ferromagnetic system , @xmath191 . within the variational approach @xmath192",
    "is guaranteed if we choose @xmath37 as an eigenstate of the total spin operator .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by a minor restriction of the variational space for the atomic occupancies  @xcite with negligible influence on the variational ground - state properties .",
    "the actual calculation of the variational spinwave dispersion is rather involved even in the limit of large dimensions .",
    "we note , however , that explicit formulae are available  @xcite which can directly be applied once the variational parameters have been determined from the minimization of the variational ground - state energy . as a first application , we present results for the two - band toy - model of sect .",
    "[ toymodel ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinwaves ] we show the variational spinwave dispersion in @xmath193  direction , @xmath194 , for the model parameters @xmath77 , @xmath80 , and the four different values @xmath195 which correspond to a magnetization per band of @xmath196 .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath197 .",
    "note that our last case corresponds to an almost complete ferromagnetic polarization .",
    "the data fit very well the formula @xmath198 in qualitative agreement with experiments on nickel  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values @xmath199 and @xmath200 for @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively , are of the right order of magnitude for nickel where @xmath203 . as lattice constant of our simple - cubic lattice we chose @xmath204 .    as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spinwaves ] , the dispersion relation is almost isotropic for @xmath205  values up to half the brillouin zone boundary  @xcite , in particular for large magnetizations .",
    "this is in contrast to the strong dependence of the electron - transfer amplitudes  @xmath206 on the lattice direction .",
    "this implies for _ strong _ ferromagnets that the collective motion of the local moments is similar to that of _ localized _ spins in an _ insulator _  @xcite .",
    "such ferromagnetic insulators are conveniently described by the heisenberg model with exchange - interaction between neighboring sites @xmath207 on a cubic lattice , @xmath208 for such a model one finds @xmath209 .",
    "the length of the effective local spins can be calculated from @xmath37 as @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) for @xmath212  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath213 , which gives the typical value @xmath214 . for an estimate of the curie temperature  @xmath215 we use the result from quantum monte - carlo calculations  @xcite @xmath216 for spins  @xmath217 on a simple - cubic lattice . in this way we find @xmath218 .",
    "this is the same order of magnitude as the condensation energy for these values of the interaction , @xmath219 , see sect .",
    "[ toymodel ] . given the arbitrariness in the relation between @xmath79 and @xmath215 , and the application of the heisenberg model to our itinerant - electron system",
    ", we may certainly allow for difference of a factor two in these quantities .",
    "nevertheless , the results of this section clearly show that , ( i ) , @xmath79 gives the right order of magnitude for @xmath215 , and that , ( ii ) , the spinwave dispersion of _ strong itinerant _ ferromagnets resemble the physics of _ localized _ spins .",
    "which scenario for itinerant ferromagnetism in transition metals is the correct one ?    for a long time",
    "this questions could not be answered conclusively . band theory along the lines of slater and stoner",
    "could be worked out in much detail whereas a correlated - electron description of narrow - band systems was lacking until recently . in fact , van vleck stated in the summary to his conference contribution in 1953 : `` the gist of this paper is that it would be highly desirable if good methods of computing with  ( c ) ( minimum polarity model ) could be developed . ''",
    "in 1963 , gutzwiller laid the foundations for a concise treatment of the problem , and today we are able to draw definite conclusions based on gutzwiller - correlated multi - band wave functions .    our results for nickel indicate that the van - vleck ",
    "gutzwiller scenario is valid .",
    "band theory does not appreciate the strong electronic correlations present in the material which lead to the observed renormalization of the effective mass , exchange splittings , bandwidths , and fermi surface topology .",
    "moreover , as also covered by our approach , charge fluctuations are small , and large local moments are present both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phases .",
    "roughly we may say that the electrons motion through the crystal leads to a ferromagnetic coupling of pre - formed moments which eventually order at low enough temperatures . in this way",
    ", strong itinerant ferromagnets resemble ferromagnetic insulators as far as their low - energy properties are concerned : spinwaves exist which destroy the magnetic long - range order at the curie temperature .",
    "it is thus seen that today computational difficulties no longer obscure `` the recognition in principle of the situation which confirms closest to physical reality''(van vleck , 1953  @xcite ) : transition metals and their compounds are strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "more than thirty - five years after their introduction by gutzwiller  @xcite , our studies clearly show that gutzwiller - correlated multi - band wave functions successfully describe the low - energy physics of these materials .",
