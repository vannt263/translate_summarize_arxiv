    "long - distance visual simultaneous localization and mapping experiences drift that require sophisticated approaches to handle in both uncooperative  @xcite and cooperative cases  @xcite .",
    "when the robot revisits a place , the drift can be greatly reduced by imposing geometric constraints in the posterior optimization ( e.g. bundle adjustment )  @xcite .",
    "identifying when a robot has returned to a previously visited place is referred as loop - closure detection .",
    "it plays a key role in visual slam systems .    since  @xcite appearance - based methods have become prevalent in visual loop closure detection , due to their decoupling from the location estimate of the robot .",
    "a key research in appearance - based methods is what kind of visual features best describe the scene .",
    "along with the progress of feature descriptor designs , various features have been used in loop - closure detection , from the traditional floating point arithmetic based features such as sift  @xcite , surf  @xcite , to the recent binary - encoded features @xcite . in the typical bag - of - words loop - closure system",
    ", a feature is extracted from a single frame after it is matched with the previous frame , then potentially used as a codeword in the vocabulary .",
    "such codewords may not be invariant to the perspective transformation from the robot motion .    a common fact in mobile robot applications , arising from the design of appearance - based loop - closure systems ,",
    "is that the robot often requires similar motion to trigger a loop - closure .",
    "the loop - closing image sequence is captured under similar perspective transformations .",
    "the key idea in this paper is to learn the codewords by learning feature descriptors invariant to the perspective transformations induced by robot motion . with such codewords , visual features from the same object subjected to perspective distortions",
    "are more likely to trigger loop - closure hypotheses and improve the recall .",
    "we use binary features due to its overall advantages demonstrated in loop - closure applications ( efficient computation with high precision - recall ( pr ) )  @xcite .",
    "learning binary features is be done by treating the image patches from a matched pair together with the mean patch as a single class , then optimizing the binary test by minimizing the intra - class distance and maximizing the inter - class distance through linear discriminants analysis ( lda )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because a codeword is learned from two consecutive images , its consistent nature implies that if an frame is retrieved as a loop - closure hypothesis , its previous or next frame should also be a hypothesis . based on this ,",
    "our algorithm imposes temporal constraints in the hypothesis selection , which further improves the precision .",
    "in addition , mathematical analysis shows that the codewords learned by our method have nice geometric properties , which theoretically supports the proposed method .",
    "the major contributions of our paper include :    * an efficient algorithm based on lda for learning codewords invariant to perspective transformations from robot motion , involving only matrix additions on image patch and bit - wise operations on binary vectors ; * theoretical justification for the geometric properties in the learned codeword , demonstrating that the learned codewords can be viewed as  centroids \" in the space induced by the modified hamming distance ; * integration into the incremental bag - of - word loop - closure detection system with additional simple hypothesis constraints that demonstrate improved pr with trivial runtime loss on various benchmark data sets .",
    "research effort has sought to improve the pipeline of appearance - based methods , involving : ( 1 ) the visual features chosen as codewords ; ( 2 ) loop - closure retrieval models , e.g. probabilistic model in fab - map  @xcite , bag of visual words model  @xcite ; ( 3 ) data structures for vocabulary storage and search , e.g. chow - liu tree  @xcite , vocabulary tree for binary features  @xcite ; and ( 4 ) online incremental design in order to get rid of offline training , e.g. ibuild system  @xcite .",
    "this review focuses on the visual features used in the loop closure detection , which is highly driven by the development of feature descriptors .",
    "early work in visual descriptors based on floating - point arithmetic , such as sift  @xcite and surf  @xcite , are typically too expensive in computation to fulfill real - time loop - closure detection .",
    "the milestone work fab - map  @xcite mitigates this problem by using quantized surf descriptors , which are encoded in binary vectors .",
    "such an approximation trades precision - recall with runtime . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors use raw sift descriptors with an additional feature space of local color histogram . with a tree - structure vocabulary in their bag - of - word model ,",
    "high frame rates are attained with the feature retrieval of logarithmic - time complexity in codeword number .",
    "the work in  @xcite attains real - time performance by using compact randomized tree signatures . with the developments of binary descriptors such as brief  @xcite , brisk  @xcite , orb  @xcite ,",
    "binary features have been widely adopted for loop - closure detection ( often with bag - of - word models ) due to their fast computation and comparable precision / recall to sift and surf .",
    "the new standard , a binary features based bag - of - word system , is presented in  @xcite .",
    "the ibuild system  @xcite further improves the binary bag - of - word recipe by designing an online incremental system without the need for prior feature training .",
    "our system improves upon ibuild .    beside standard feature descriptors ,",
    "related research has sought to improve descriptors through additional learning processes .",
    "these learning approaches include lda  @xcite , boosting  @xcite , principal component analysis ( pca )  @xcite , domain - size pooling  @xcite , etc .",
    "our work is inspired by  @xcite , in which lda is applied by learning a mask * locally * to minimize the intra - class distance of binary descriptors .",
    "the algorithm synthesizes samples from each image by rotating the patch , and treats the original patch as a pivot patch along with the axillary samples to form a single class for lda .",
    "to contrast , our method first uses the synthesized patch as the pivot patch and the original patches as auxillary patches .",
    "more importantly , instead of learning the invariance to some heuristic rotation transformations , our method learns the transformation invariance for the actual robot motion .",
    "this section first presents basics about binary feature descriptors and the lda method for optimizing the descriptor by learning a mask . then it details the proposed algorithm for learning features from motion dynamics .",
