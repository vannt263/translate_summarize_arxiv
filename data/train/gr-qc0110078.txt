    "in the pseudo - riemannian spacetime of general relativity theory , we can introduce at each point of spacetime a local vector basis or frame @xmath0 , with @xmath1 .",
    "as already indicated by the notation , the zeroth leg @xmath2 is conventionally chosen to be timelike whereas @xmath3 are chosen to be spacelike .",
    "specifically , the frame is _ pseudo - orthonormal _ , i.e. , @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes the scalar product of two vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 defined by the riemannian metric and @xmath8 are the components of the lorentz metric .",
    "three spacelike legs are not particularly practical if one wants to investigate , say , electromagnetic or gravitational wave propagation .",
    "then , on the coordinate level , one introduces null coordinates @xmath9 ( advanced and retarded ones ) .",
    "similarly , on the level of the frame , one has two null legs @xmath10 .",
    "the two remaining legs are untouched and stay spacelike .",
    "such a _ half - null _ frame leads immediately to the idea to transform also the space - like legs to null legs .",
    "if one wants to uphold orthonormality , this is only possible if one defines the new complex legs @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "newman - penrose _",
    "null frame consists of two real and two complex null vectors @xcite .",
    "it turned out to be extremely useful for studying the properties of gravitational waves and of exact solutions of einstein s field equation .",
    "if one relaxes the constraint of orthonormality , one could also hope that one is able to define a frame consisting of four _ real _ null vectors .",
    "in fact , such a frame was found by coll & morales@xcite , and corresponding coordinates even earlier by derrick@xcite , see also @xcite . amongst those frames ,",
    "there are specifically the ` symmetric null frames ' consisting of four legs none of which is geometrically distinguished .",
    "such a null frame @xmath13 can be constructed from an orthonormal frame by a suitable non - degenerate linear transformation .",
    "since this construction is not widely known , we will present it in sec.ii in a hopefully easily accessible way .",
    "we will study some of the properties of that frame and will visualize it by means of a tetrahedron in 3-dimensional space . in sec.iii we will introduce a real null _",
    "co_frame @xmath14 which turns out _ not _ to be dual to the null frame @xmath13 .",
    "recently , rovelli@xcite , in a framework related to the global positioning system ( gps ) @xcite , constructed four coordinates @xmath15 in terms of which the components of the metric look null symmetric , see also coll@xcite . in sec.iv",
    ", we follow up these ideas and show that rovelli s coframe @xmath16 is closely related to the real coframe @xmath14 .",
    "at each point of 4-dimensional spacetime with coordinates @xmath17 , here @xmath18 , we have the 4-dimensional tangent vector space",
    ". four linearly independent vectors @xmath19 constitute a basis or , alternatively expressed , a _",
    "frame_. dual to this frame is the _ coframe _ @xmath20 which consists of 4 covectors ( one - forms ) .",
    "one can decompose frame and coframe with respect to the local coordinate frame according to @xmath21 with the duality relations @xmath22 the @xmath23 are called frame ( or tetrad ) components .",
    "let the tangent vector space carry a metric @xmath24 .",
    "thereby we can define a scalar product @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two vectors .",
    "accordingly , the components of the metric with respect to the frame @xmath19 are determined by @xmath25 .",
    "conversely , the metric can be reconstructed from its components via @xmath26see frankel@xcite , for instance .",
    "traditionally , in relativity theory the vectors of an _ orthonormal _ frame are labeled by @xmath27 , thus underlining the fundamental difference between @xmath2 , which has positive length @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , which have negative lengths @xmath31 ( no summation ) . in general , a vector @xmath6 is called _ time - like _ if @xmath32 , _ space - like _ if @xmath33 , and _ null _ ( or light - like ) if @xmath34",
    ". the components of the metric tensor with respect to the orthonormal frame @xmath19 are then @xmath35 the star equal sign indicates that the corresponding equation is only valid for specific frames , namely for orthonormal ones .",
    "starting from an orthonormal frame @xmath19 with respect to which the metric has the standard form ( [ eta ] ) , we can build a new frame @xmath36 by the linear transformation @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the kernel index method that we are using ,",
    "see schouten@xcite , the frames @xmath39 and @xmath19 are distinguished by the different type of indices .",
    "the first two vectors of the new frame are null : @xmath40 .",
    "correspondingly , the metric with respect to this _ half - null _ frame @xmath39 reads @xmath41    following newman & penrose@xcite , we can further construct two more _ null _ vectors as the _ complex _ linear combinations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the imaginary unit and overbar means complex conjugation .",
    "this transformation leads to the lorentz metric in a _",
    "newman - penrose _",
    "null frame @xmath46 : @xmath47 such a frame is convenient for investigating the properties of gravitational and electromagnetic waves .    in the newman - penrose frame , we have two real null legs , namely @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and two complex ones , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it may be surprising to learn that it is also possible to define the _ special null _ frame which consists of four _ real _ null vectors .",
    "we start from an orthonormal frame @xmath19 , with @xmath52 , and define the new frame @xmath53 according to @xmath54 this can also be written as @xmath55 since @xmath56 for all @xmath57 , the null frame consists solely of real non - orthogonal null - vectors .",
    "the metric with respect to this frame reads @xmath58 this inequality means that the coframe dual to the frame @xmath53 is _ not null_.      the metric ( [ finkmat ] ) looks completely symmetric in all its components : seemingly the time coordinate is not preferred in any sense .",
    "nevertheless , eq.([finkmat ] ) represents a truly lorentzian metric .",
    "its determinant is @xmath59 and the eigenvalues are readily computed to be @xmath60 which shows that the metric ( [ finkmat ] ) has , indeed , the correct signature .",
    "the frame @xmath61 , by the linear transformation @xmath62 , can be transformed back to the orthonormal frame @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix @xmath63 is inverse to the matrix @xmath64 in ( [ saller1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "provided the original orthonormal frame @xmath19 is a coordinate or _",
    "natural _ frame , i.e. , @xmath66 , then , because of ( [ saller1 ] ) and @xmath67 , the frame @xmath53 is also natural .",
    "accordingly , we can introduce coordinates @xmath68 such that ( we drop now the tilde ) @xmath69 under those circumstances , the metric reads @xmath70    there is a beautiful geometrical interpretation of the four null legs of the frame @xmath13 , see finkelstein@xcite . in a _",

    ", let us consider the three - dimensional spacelike hypersurface which is spanned by @xmath71 .",
    "the four points which are defined by the spatial parts of the frame vectors ( [ f2e ] ) , with coordinates @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , form a regular tetrahedron in the 3-dimensional subspace , see fig.1 .",
    "the vertices @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are equidistant from the origin @xmath80 ; the distance is @xmath81 .",
    "correspondingly , all sides of this tetrahedron have equal length , namely @xmath82 .",
    "if we now send , at the moment @xmath83 , a light pulse from the origin @xmath84 , it reaches all four vertices of the tetrahedron at @xmath85 .",
    "thus four light rays provide the operational definition for the light - like frame @xmath13 in ( [ f2e ] ) . in a riemannian spacetime",
    ", we can choose riemannian normal coordinates .",
    "then , provided the tetrahedron is sufficiently small , we will have an analogous interpretation .    in the _ special _ real null frame ( [ f2e ] ) ,",
    "all legs are equivalent .",
    "however , it is possible to apply a linear transformation that keeps the zeros in the diagonal of ( [ finkmat ] ) but changes the off diagonal matrix elements such that the matrix remains symmetric and non - degenerate . in this way",
    ", we find a _",
    "general _ real null frame . under such circumstances , the four real null vectors @xmath13 are no longer ` indistinguishable ' .",
    "the inverse of the matrix ( [ finkmat ] ) is _ not _ the same matrix , in contrast to the analogous cases ( [ eta ] ) , ( [ halfnull ] ) , and ( [ npnull ] ) .",
    "we rather find @xmath86 in other words , @xmath87 , but @xmath88 ( no summation over @xmath89 ) .",
    "however , we are able to find a new real null _ co_frame by defining , in analogy to ( [ f2e ] ) , @xmath90 accordingly , we have @xmath91 where @xmath77 is the transpose of @xmath92 in ( [ saller1 ] ) : @xmath93 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath94 thus , @xmath95 is a _ special _ null coframe with the contravariant metric components as given by ( [ nullcoframe2 ] ) .",
    "the visualization of the new null coframe leads also to a tetrahedron in 3-space which is `` dual '' to the one of fig.1 .",
    "we depicted that in fig.2 .",
    "the vertices of the coframe tetrahedron are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "its sides have a length of @xmath100 .",
    "the barycenters of the four triangles of the tetrahedron are the vertices @xmath101 of the tetrahedron of fig.1 .    according to the construction , the 3-vectors @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ,",
    "representing light rays , are perpendicular to the triangles @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "therefore , at the points @xmath76 etc . ,",
    "the planes @xmath106 etc .",
    "represent the wave fronts of the light .",
    "together with the parallel planes through @xmath80 , the planes @xmath106 etc .  symbolize covectors that are algebraically dual to the vectors @xmath107 etc .",
    "the interior product of the vectors with the corresponding covectors is always @xmath108 . in this sense ,",
    "the outer tetrahedron is dual to the inner one .",
    "the most general null coframe has the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding contravariant components of the metric read @xmath112 for @xmath113 , the general expression for @xmath114 reduces to the special form ( [ nullcoframe2 ] ) .",
    "let us eventually turn to rovelli s paper @xcite which prompted our remarks in the first place .",
    "the 4-velocity of a massive particle moving in a ( flat ) minkowski space @xmath115 , expressed in the standard _",
    "inertial _ coordinates @xmath17 , has the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 represents the 3-velocity and @xmath118 a unit 3-vector .",
    "we assume @xmath7 to be constant .",
    "the 4-vector @xmath119 is normalized , i.e. , @xmath120 . for constant @xmath119 ,",
    "the particle s trajectory is of the simple form @xmath121    suppose there is an observer at some point @xmath122 with coordinates @xmath123 who is able to detect light signals emitted from the moving particle .",
    "the observer s light cone is described by the equation @xmath124 the condition that the particle s trajectory intersects this light cone is obtained by solving the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) . substituting ( [ e2 ] ) into ( [ e3 ] ) , we obtain a quadratic equation for @xmath125 , namely @xmath126 , which yields @xmath127 the minus sign given in front of the square root refers to the past light cone , whereas the plus sign is suppressed since it refers to the future light cone .",
    "we should note that the result in ( [ e4 ] ) is correct for _ any _ choice of the unit vector @xmath49 in @xmath128 .",
    "if we consider a set of four particles , see fig.3 , in which one space dimension is suppressed and thus only three particles are visible , then eqs.([e1 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are replaced by equations of the same type , @xmath129 here @xmath130 and @xmath131 is a label for different particles .",
    "note that the four 3-velocities @xmath132 are in general different from each other , in contrast to the original rovelli construction where they are all equal .",
    "this generalization is physically quite natural , and it will be important in our considerations . in the next step ,",
    "following rovelli , we introduce @xmath133 as new coordinates on the @xmath115 .",

    "the components @xmath143 , for @xmath144 , depend only on the scalar products @xmath145 and @xmath146 . the surfaces @xmath147 are null hypersurfaces .",
    "we now drop the primes for simplicity .    in _ frame _ ( [ f2e ] ) , we have @xmath148 , but @xmath149 , in contrast to equation ( [ diag ] ) .",
    "however , for the general real null coframe of ( [ m3 ] ) , we have the desired @xmath150 .",
    "therefore it is evident that the rovelli coordinates are closely related to this general real null coframe .",
    "rovelli s coframe @xmath151 belongs to the class of general null coframes ( [ m3 ] ) , hence it can be reduced to our special null coframe ( [ nullcoframe1 ] ) by demanding @xmath152 or , more explicitly , @xmath153    we shall now find a particular solution of these equations for @xmath154 , for a given position @xmath155 of the observer . without loss of generality , we can choose the inertial coordinates @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath156 in that case , by multiplying eqs.([m6 ] ) with @xmath157 , we find @xmath158 since @xmath159 and @xmath160 , it follows that @xmath161 this result combined with eqs.([m6 ] ) leads to @xmath162 a simple form of @xmath154 , consistent with these conditions , is given by @xmath163 where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are undetermined velocities and the @xmath164 are the 3-dimensional unit vectors of ( [ f2e ] ) : @xmath165    we now use eqs.([m8 ] ) in order to express @xmath166 in terms of @xmath167 : @xmath168 then we substitute @xmath169 from eqs.([m9 ] ) into ( [ last ] ) , and obtain ( only ) two independent equations : @xmath170 taking into account the explicit expressions for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , these equations can be written in the simple form @xmath173 with @xmath174 for @xmath175 or @xmath6 .",

    "in general , for all sets of parameters @xmath181 which satisfy the requirements above , rovelli s null coframe reduces to our special null coframe ( [ nullcoframe1 ] ) .    in conclusion , in this paper we introduced and discussed the special real null coframe ( [ nullcoframe1 ] ) whereupon the meaning of rovelli s coordinates in minkowski spacetime becomes clearer .",
