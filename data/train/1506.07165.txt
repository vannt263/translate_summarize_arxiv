    "it is common practice in many studies involving networks to assume that nodes are connected by a single type of edge that encapsulates all relations between them . in a myriad of applications",
    "this assumption oversimplifies the complexity of the system , leading to inaccurate or wrong results .",
    "examples can be found in temporal networks , where neglecting time - dependence washes out the memory of sequences of human contacts in transmission of diseases @xcite , in co - authorship networks , where neglecting the existence of multiple relationships between actors might alter the topology which may lead to misestimating crucial node s properties @xcite or in transportation networks where the multilayer topology must be considered to accurately model the dynamics to _ a posteriori _ predict congested locations @xcite .",
    "historically , the term _ multiplex _ was coined to indicate the presence of more than one relationship between the same actors of a social network @xcite .",
    "this type of network is well understood in terms of `` coloring '' ( or labeling ) the edges corresponding to interactions of different nature .",
    "for instance , in a social network the same individual might have connections to other individuals based on financial interests ( e.g. , color red ) and connections with the same or different individuals based on friendship ( e.g. , color blue ) .",
    "in other real - world systems , like the transportation network of a city , the same geographical position can be part , for instance , of the network of subway or the network of bus routes , simultaneously . in this specific case",
    ", an edge - colored graph would not capture the full structure of the network , since information about the cost to _ move _ from the subway network to the bus route is missing .",
    "this cost can be economic or might account for the time required to physically commute between the two layers .",
    "it is in this cases where an the interconnected multilayer network provides a better representation of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : mplex - vs - edgecolor ] shows an illustration of an interconnected multilayer ( fig.[fig : mplex - vs - edgecolor ]  a ) and the classical representation with an aggregated network ( fig.[fig : mplex - vs - edgecolor ]  c ) .",
    "it is evident that a simple projection of the former  mathematically equivalent to sum up the corresponding adjacency matrices of the individual layers  would provide a network where the information about the relation type is lost . on the other hand , an edge - colored graph ( fig.[fig : mplex - vs - edgecolor ]  b ) can not account for interconnections .",
    "for further details about the classification of such multilayer networks we refer to @xcite and references therein . in the rest of the paper interconnected multilayer networks will be referred in short as multilayer networks .    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the average mean first passage time @xmath0}$ ] to node @xmath1 is obtained by averaging @xmath2}{\\right)}^{o\\sigma}$ ] over all possible starting nodes and layers as @xmath3 } = \\frac{1}{(n-1)l}u_{o\\sigma}{\\left(}h_{[d]}{\\right)}^{o\\sigma } + \\frac{1}{n}\\pi^{-1}_{[d]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4}$ ] is the occupation probability of node @xmath1 and the term @xmath5}$ ] is included explicitly to account for the average return time , that is not accounted for when using absorbing random walks .    finally , the random walk closeness centrality of node @xmath1 is defined as the inverse of @xmath0}$ ] .",
    "we introduce the vector @xmath6 whose components are given by the inverse of the corresponding values of @xmath7 .",
    "the comparison between the values of @xmath6 obtained from simulations and theoretical predictions are shown in fig.[fig : evaluationcloseness ] .",
    "as in the betweenness centrality , the results are in excellent agreement and it is worth remarking that the equivalence holds regardless of the number of nodes in the network , the topology and the number of layers .",
    "we have extended the main random walk centrality measures to interconnected multilayer networks and gave interpretation of their meaning . in addition",
    ", we have presented analytical approaches , based on the tensorial formalism defined in @xcite , for their computation .",
    "the comparison of the predictions given by our analytical approach with the results obtained by simulations show a perfect agreement , concluding that the presented analytical expressions are ready to be applied to the analysis of real complex networks .",
    "we expect that the presented results are useful in many interdisciplinary applications ranging from social sciences to transportation networks .",

    "the eigenvalue problem for a rank-2 tensor , i.e. , a standard matrix , is defined by @xmath8 .",
    "the extension of this problem to rank-4 tensors leads to the equation @xmath9 to solve this problem , it is worth noting that any tensor can be _ unfolded _ to lower rank tensors @xcite .",
    "for instance , a rank-2 tensor like @xmath10 , with @xmath11 components , can be flattened to a vector @xmath12 with @xmath11 components . in the case of the rank-4 multilayer adjacency tensor @xmath13 , although any unfolding is allowed , it is particularly useful for some applications to choose the ones flattening to a squared rank-2 tensor @xmath14 with @xmath15 components , where @xmath16 indicates the number of layers @xcite .",
    "in fact , this unfolding produces as many block adjacency matrices , named _ supra - adjacency matrices _ in some applications @xcite , as the number of permutations of diagonal blocks of size @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "however , such unfoldings do not alter the spectral properties of the resulting supra - matrix and can be used to solve the eigenvalue problem for rank-4 tensors . in fact , the solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath18 is a _ supra - vector _ with @xmath19 components which corresponds to the unfolding of the eigentensor @xmath20 .",
    "given @xmath21 random walks starting in node @xmath22 on layer @xmath23 and ending when reaching node @xmath1 , regardless of the layer , the expected number of times a random walk will pass by node @xmath24 on layer @xmath25 is given by @xmath26}{\\right)}^{o\\sigma}_{j\\beta } & = & \\lim_{m \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{m } \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{m } \\sum\\limits_{t=0}^{\\infty } z_{j\\beta}^{o\\sigma}(t , m),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 if walk @xmath28 was visiting node @xmath24 in layer @xmath25 at time step @xmath29 and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "following the frequentist interpretation , the probability of being in node @xmath24 in layer @xmath25 at time step @xmath29 , provided that the walk originated in node @xmath22 in layer @xmath23 , is given by @xmath31 substituting ( [ eq : probofbeingaslimit ] ) in ( [ eq : meannumberoftimes ] ) we obtain that @xmath32}{\\right)}^{o\\sigma}_{j\\beta } & = & \\sum\\limits_{t=0}^{\\infty } p_{j{\\beta}}^{o{\\sigma}}(t ) = \\sum\\limits_{t=0}^{\\infty } { \\left(}t_{[d]}^{t}{\\right)}^{o\\sigma}_{j\\beta } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\left[}{\\left(}\\delta - t_{[d]}{\\right)}^{-1}{\\right]}^{o\\sigma}_{j\\beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33}$ ] corresponds to the absorbing transition tensor defined in eq.([eq : abstrantensor ] ) .",

    "<S> it is of crucial importance in many fields , from economics to biology and from urban planning to social sciences , to identify the most ( or the less ) influent nodes in a network using centrality measures . </S>",
    "<S> however , defining the centrality of actors in interconnected complex networks is not trivial . in this paper , we rely on the tensorial formalism recently proposed to characterize and investigate this kind of complex topologies , and extend two well known random walk centrality measures , the random walk betweenness and closeness centrality , to interconnected multilayer networks . for each of the measures we provide analytical expressions that completely agree with numerically results . </S>"
