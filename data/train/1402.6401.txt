    "since the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope was launched in june 2008 , the main instrument on - board  the large area telescope ( lat ) has been continuously scanning the whole sky every three hours in the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev , discovering and monitoring @xmath3-ray sources with much improved spatial resolution and sensitivity comparing to former @xmath3-ray telescopes @xcite . in 2012 resulting from _ fermi_/lat data of the first two - year survey , a catalog of 1873 @xmath3-ray sources was released by @xcite as the _ fermi_/lat second source catalog . among the @xmath3-ray sources ,",
    "approximately 800 and 250 were found to be respectively associated with blazars and active galaxies of uncertain types , and more than 100 were associated with pulsars in our galaxy .",
    "the three types thus account for the majority of the @xmath3-ray sources detected by _",
    "fermi_. in addition , 575 sources in the catalog have not been associated with any known astrophysical objects @xcite . for the purpose of identifying the nature of these unassociated sources ,",
    "many follow - up studies , such as classifying their @xmath3-ray characteristics @xcite , searching for radio pulsars @xcite , and observing at multi - wavelengths @xcite , have been carried out .",
    "because of the relative lack of sources at low galactic latitudes in many extragalactic source catalogs and the emission contamination by the galaxy , the galactic distribution of the _ fermi _ unassociated sources were found to concentrate towards the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "more than half of the unassociated sources are located at low latitudes with @xmath5 10  @xcite , possibly suggesting galactic origins for most of them .",
    "taking under consideration the types of identified and associated galactic @xmath3-ray sources in the catalog , these low - latitude unassociated sources are most likely pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae , supernova remnants , globular clusters , or high - mass binaries .",
    "additionally since identified and associated agns or blazars have a nearly isotropic distribution , agn / blazar origins for these sources can not be excluded . in any case , the low - latitude _ fermi _ unassociated sources are the best young pulsar candidates on the basis of currently known galactic @xmath3-ray populations , as @xmath150% of the identified or associated galactic _",
    "_  sources are pulsars @xcite and the _ fermi_-detected millisecond pulsars are nearly isotropic ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) . with high rotational energy loss rates ( so - called spin - down luminosities ) ,",
    "young pulsars are clustered close to the galactic plane and can be detected to large distances .",
    "aiming to search for new pulsars among the unassociated sources , we selected the pulsar candidates from the _ fermi _ second source catalog by requiring @xmath5 10  and variability indices ( variability_index parameter in the catalog ) lower than 41 .",
    "the variability indices were reported to measure the variability levels of sources , and a value larger than 41.64 indicates @xmath6% chance of being a steady source @xcite .",
    "we further ranked the candidates by their signif_curve parameters reported in the catalog , which represent the significance of the fit improvement between curved spectra and power - law spectra , as @xmath3-ray pulsars typically have curved spectra with a form of exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "the first ten sources from our selection are listed in table  [ tab : candi ] .",
    "the first source listed is 2fgl j1704.9@xmath74618 , which has the highest signif_curve value of @xmath19.97@xmath2 but the lowest detection significance value ( @xmath19@xmath2 ; signif_avg parameter in the catalog ) . for a comparison , the second source in our list",
    "2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 has both high signif_curve ( @xmath19.85@xmath2 ) and signif_avg values ( @xmath124@xmath2 ) , and is ranked the first among candidate pulsars by @xcite , who applied a gaussian - mixture model for the ranking . among the bright @xmath3-ray sources ( @xmath820@xmath2 detection significance ) , this source is clearly located in the pulsar region in the plane of the curvature significance versus variability index @xcite .",
    "we thus carried out detailed study of 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 by analyzing _",
    "fermi_/lat data of the source region , and report our results in this paper .",
    "in addition , 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 is located close to a very bright @xmath3-ray pulsar j1907@xmath00602 ( signif_avg @xmath1 55@xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the angular distance between them is approximately 1.3 degrees ( see figure  [ fig : ts ] ) .",
    "the pulsar was discovered in the first @xmath14 month lat data , revealed with a spin frequency of @xmath19.378 hz and a spin - down luminosity of @xmath12.8@xmath910@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the pulsar is radio faint , making very difficult to study its timing behavior at radio frequencies @xcite . in order to better",
    "study our targeted _ fermi _  source by removing possible contamination from psr j1907@xmath00602 , we performed timing analysis to the lat data of the pulsar and include our timing results in this paper .",
    "lat is the main instrument on - board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope .",
    "it is a @xmath3-ray imaging instrument which carries out an all - sky survey in the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we selected lat events inside a 20@xmath9 20  region centered at the position of 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 during a nearly five - year time period from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 to 2013 - 07 - 23 20:53:17 ( utc ) from the _ fermi _ pass 7 database . following recommendations of the lat team",
    ", events included were required to have event zenith angles fewer than 100 deg , preventing contamination from the earth s limb , and to be during good time intervals when the quality of the data was not affected by the spacecraft events .",
    "after the _ fermi _  discovery of psr j1907@xmath00602 @xcite , its timing solution was updated by @xcite and @xcite using the lat data during mjd 5464755074 and mjd 5468255211 , respectively . in 2013",
    "the _ fermi_/lat team released the second _ fermi _ catalog of @xmath3-ray pulsars @xcite , in which the timing solution for psr j1907@xmath00602 was updated again using the data during mjd 5469155817 .",
    "a glitch at mjd 55422 was detected with @xmath12 of @xmath1 4.6 @xmath9 10@xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath1 1 @xmath9 10@xmath15 .    in order to study 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 by being able to remove photons from the nearby pulsar",
    ", we performed phase - connected timing analysis to the lat data of j1907@xmath00602 during the nearly five - year time period of mjd 5468356497 .",
    "we selected lat events within 07 centered at the pulsar s position given in the catalog in the energy range from 50 mev to 300 gev , which was suggested by @xcite .",
    "pulse phases for photons before mjd 55400 were assigned according to the known ephemeris using the _ fermi _ plugin of tempo2 @xcite .",
    "we extracted an ` empirical fourier ' template profile , with which we generated the time - of - arrivals ( toas ) of 128 evenly divided observations of the time period .",
    "both the template and toas were obtained using the maximum likelihood method described in @xcite . from the pre - fit residuals we found that the timing model given in the second _ fermi _ catalog of @xmath3-ray pulsars could not fully describe the toas after mjd @xmath155800 , suggesting the requirement of an updated timing model .",
    "we then iteratively fitted the toas to the timing model using tempo2 .",
    "for the glitch because of its relative large amplitude and long interval between the last pre - glitch and the first post - glitch observations , we could not obtain a unique solution to accurately determine its epoch by requiring continuous pulse phase . instead , we adopted one of the solutions according to the ephemeris we obtained as the glitch epoch , which is closest to that reported in the second _ fermi _ catalog of @xmath3-ray pulsars .",
    "the updated ephemeris is given in table  [ tab : timing ] , the post - fit timing residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : rms ] , and the folded pulse profile and the two - dimensional phaseogram of this pulsar are plotted in figure  [ fig : ftp ] .",
    "we defined phase 0.10.7 as the onpulse phase interval and phase 0.71.1 as the offpulse phase interval ( figure  [ fig : ftp ] ) , using the definition given in @xcite .",
    "we selected lat events in an energy range from 100 mev to 300 gev for the likelihood analysis , and included all sources within 15 degrees centered at the position of 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 in the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog to make the source model .",
    "the spectral function forms of the sources are given in the catalog .",
    "the spectral normalization parameters for the sources within 4 degrees from 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 were left free , and all the other parameters were fixed to their catalog values .",
    "in addition we included the spectrum model gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits and the spectrum file iso_p7v6source.txt in the source model to consider the galactic and the extragalactic diffuse emission , respectively .",
    "the normalizations of the diffuse components were left free .    in the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog , the @xmath3-ray emission from 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 is modeled by a log parabola expressed by @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we fixed the break energy to the catalog value of @xmath11 gev , and let the indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 free .",
    "we also tested two other models for the source : an exponentially cutoff power law expressed by @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the spectral index , @xmath21 is the cutoff energy , and @xmath22 represents the sharpness of the cutoff , and a simple power law expressed by @xmath23 . for the exponentially cutoff power law we note that all pulsars in the second _ fermi _",
    "@xmath3-ray pulsar catalog with @xmath22 values different from 1 ( usually smaller than 1 and indicating a sub - exponential cutoff ) have @xmath21 higher than 2 gev @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we repeated binned likelihood analysis described above by including lat events only during the offpulse phase intervals to prevent possible contamination from the pulsar .",
    "the phase intervals are defined in section  [ subsec : timing ] . since the emission from the pulsar was removed , we excluded this source from the source model .",
    "the likelihood fitting results for the different @xmath3-ray spectral models for 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 are given in table  [ tab : likeli ] , and the ts map of a @xmath25 region around 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : ts ] .",
    "the ts values are significantly increased comparing to those when the full data were used , having doubled the detection significance of 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 .",
    "in addition , a low - energy break or cutoff at @xmath11 gev in the source s emission is similarly favored as that in the analysis of the full data .      to obtain a spectrum for 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720",
    ", we evenly divided 20 energy ranges in logarithm from 100 mev to 300 gev , and used a simple power law to model the emission in each divided energy range .",
    "the index of the power law was fixed to the value we obtained before ( table  [ tab : likeli ] ) .",
    "this method is less model - dependent and provides a good description for the @xmath3-ray emission of a source .",
    "the spectra from both the full data and the offpulse phase interval data were obtained , which are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",

    "we plotted the obtained exponentially cutoff power - law fits and log - parabolic fits from the above likelihood analysis in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "as can be seen , the first model does not provide a good fit to the lat spectrum . at energies of greater than several gev ,",
    "the fit deviates from the spectrum for both the full data and the offpulse phase interval data of psr j1907@xmath00602 .",
    "the log parabola better describes the spectra , which is also indicated by the larger ts values obtained with it ( table  [ tab : likeli ] ) , although a small degree of deviations from the spectra can still be seen .",
    "these may suggest an additional spectral component at the high energy range .",
    "we fit the spectral data points below 2 gev with exponentially cutoff power laws and obtained @xmath20 of 1.4@xmath310.2 and @xmath32 of 1.0@xmath310.2 gev from the full data , and @xmath20 of 1.6@xmath310.1 and @xmath32 of 0.7@xmath310.1 gev from the offpulse phase interval data .",
    "the cutoff energy values are within the range of young @xmath3-ray pulsars ( 0.4 @xmath33 5.9 ; see table  9 in @xcite ) but lower than that of millisecond @xmath3-ray pulsars ( 1.1 @xmath33 5.4 ; see table  9 in @xcite ) .",

    "the emission of the two putative sources were modeled by a simple power law .",

    "<S> 2fgl j1906.5@xmath00720 is confirmed to have a significant low energy cutoff at @xmath1 1  gev in its emission ( 14@xmath218@xmath2 significance ) , consistent with those seen in young pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we search for pulsations but no spin frequency signals are found in a frequency range of 0.532 hz . no single model can fully describe the source s overall _ fermi _  @xmath3-ray spectrum , and the reason for this is the excess emission detected at energies of @xmath44 gev . </S>",
