    "since the discovery of high - tc cuprates , intensive studies have been done on the two - dimensional antiferromagnets . it is now established that the ground state of the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet with the nearest neighbor interaction on the square lattice shows the antiferromagnetic ( af ) long range ordering at zero temperature@xcite , and the low energy spin excitation can be described in terms of the spin wave theory .",
    "however this does not mean that the electronic state in the antiferromagnets is fully understood .",
    "compared with the triplet channel of the two - particle correlation functions , the single particle properties such as the angle resolved photo - emission spectra ( arpes)@xcite , and the singlet channel correlation functions such as the charge transport properties@xcite still remain controversial .",
    "in fact , there are two different pictures for it .",
    "one is the conventional spin density wave ( sdw ) picture@xcite with the wavenumber @xmath13 where both the weak and strong coupling regions can be smoothly connected .",
    "the other picture is the @xmath14-flux state@xcite originated from the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) idea@xcite . at half filling , the @xmath14-flux state is equivalent to the d - wave singlet paring state@xcite due to the particle - hole su(2 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller projected wavefunction with the d - wave paring and af orders gives a better energy compared with that only with the af order@xcite .",
    "also the higher energy continuum of the neutron scattering spectra and raman scattering spectra has been analyzed in terms of this @xmath14-flux state@xcite .",
    "the dispersion of a single hole put into this antiferromagnet is an important issue studied intensively in terms of self - consistent born approximation@xcite , exact diagonalization@xcite , spinon - holon bound state picture@xcite , and variational method@xcite . with the @xmath15-@xmath16 model ,",
    "all the analyses give the maximum of the hole dispersion at @xmath17 .",
    "this dispersion can be understood in terms of the @xmath14-flux picture@xcite , which introduces the nodal fermi points of the spinons at @xmath17 with the dispersion similar to the d - wave superconductors .",
    "this fits the arpes experiments in the undoped cuprates@xcite .    at finite doping",
    ", the slave - boson mean - field theory of the @xmath15-@xmath16 model predicts the state with both the singlet rvb and af orders for small @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) symmetry has been employed to represent the constraint and the underdoped pseudogap region is characterized as the staggered flux state with spin - charge separation@xcite , which can be regarded as the fluctuating state between the d - wave pairing state and the current order state . on the other hand ,",
    "the staggered flux state with the electron coordinates with the real current ordering and periodicity doubling has been proposed for the underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "recently there appeared several experiments on the hall coefficient @xmath1 and the thermopower @xmath2 in the heavily underdoped cuprates , which raised the issue of particle - hole symmetry@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 as well as the @xmath2 show the strong suppression below the neel temperature @xmath11 in some ybco samples@xcite while it is not the case for other samples@xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that the transport properties below @xmath11 is sensitive to the oxygen chain ordering and/or the self - organization of electrons such as the stripes , which depends on the annealing procedure in the sample preparation .",
    "another interesting clue is that in lsco the suppression of the hall effect is observed only in the vertical ( horizontal ) stripe state while is not in the diagonal stripe state for @xmath18@xcite . above @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath1 is a decreasing function of temperature , which remains one of the most puzzling features in the normal state properties@xcite .    in the sdw picture ,",
    "the large metallic fermi surface enclosing the area of @xmath19 ( @xmath7 : hole concentration ) is recovered above @xmath11 .",
    "therefore we expect the drastic change of the hall constant from @xmath20 to @xmath21 when the temperature @xmath22 is lowered across @xmath11 .",
    "( here @xmath6 is the lattice constant . )",
    "correspondingly the resistivity should be affected by the onset of the af order .",
    "this is in sharp contradiction with the experiments . even above @xmath11",
    ", the system behaves as the doped mott insulator with the small number of holes@xcite , and even a slight change of the resistivity is not observed at @xmath11@xcite .",
    "considering all these clues , it is worthwhile to study the transport properties of the slightly doped @xmath14-flux state both above and below @xmath11 , which we undertake in this paper .",
    "we will neglect the interactions between electrons and the disorder potentials .",
    "the former is justified because the quasi - particle number is small at low temperature due to the reduced density of states and the el - el interaction is irrelevant .",
    "the latter becomes important at low temperature for small @xmath7 where the resistivity shows an upturn , but is irrelevant for the temperature and @xmath7-range of our interest .",
    "we also study the effect of the stripe formation on the hall constant and the thermopower , and show that oxygen chain ordering is crucial for these quantities .",
    "the deviation of the flux from @xmath14 , which breaks the time - reversal symmetry and produces current ordering , is also studied .",
    "this issue is closely related to the parity anomaly@xcite in ( 2 + 1)d because the two species of the dirac fermions acquires the mass gap due to the af ordering .",
    "therefore the undoped and underdoped cuprates offers an interesting laboratory to study the transport properties of the dirac fermions with nontrivial topological nature influenced by the af order and/or the stripe formation .",
    "the dirac fermion has been studied also in the context of the nodal quasi - particle in the d - wave supercouductors@xcite . in this case",
    "the fermi energy is always at @xmath23 and the particles - hole symmetry remains . under the external magnetic field @xmath24 ,",
    "the formation of the vortex lattice is crucial , which introduces the magnetic length scale @xmath25 . in the present case ,",
    "on the other hand , there occurs no meissner effect , and one can see the response of the dirac fermions in the uniform state , while the particle - hole symmetry is broken due to the shift of the fermi energy from @xmath23 .",
    "this introduces the length scale @xmath26 , i.e. , the inter - hole distance , and we can have the new kind of scaling when neither af order nor the stripe formation occur .    the plan of this paper follows . in sec .",

    "when the external electromagnetic ( em ) field @xmath55 is coupled to each dirac fermion , the chern - simons term @xmath56 is generated .",
    "therefore the dirac fermion with positive ( negative ) @xmath57 has the right ( left ) chirality . because there are two right ( r ) and left ( l ) dirac fermions",

    "this remains true even when the flux @xmath3 is different from @xmath14 and the time - reversal symmetry is broken to produce the current order , as long as diagonal stripes are absent , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "it is because the current pattern is staggered , and does not affect the uniform response in an essential way .",

    "the af order enhances the both quantities at the almost all temperature range except for the region near the peak of @xmath1 , and shift the peaks to higher temperature .",

    "these results are parallel to the above results where the temperature is fixed .",
    "now we discuss the above results in comparison with the experiments .",
    "the most important issue is whether the high temperature phase above @xmath11 and the pseudo - gap region can be described in terms of the massless dirac fermions by putting @xmath111 .",
    "the temperature and @xmath7-dependences of @xmath1 and @xmath2 appear to be qualitatively consistent with the experiments .",
    "however , when one looks at the @xmath7-dependence of the conductivity @xmath96 at @xmath112 above @xmath11 , it fits better with @xmath113 rather than @xmath114 due to the @xmath7-dependence of the hole mobility@xcite . on the other hand , @xmath97 and @xmath115 in the our model , which is contradicting with the above experiments .",
    "furthermore , the onset of the af order at @xmath11 does not affect the conductivity @xmath96 in the experiment@xcite , which is more difficult to understand from any mean field picture .",
    "this is related to the interpretation of the insulating gap at @xmath116 . in the mean field picture , it is due to the af ordering while there remains a large gap even without the af order in the mott insulator picture .",
    "if the large gap disappears and crossing of the two bands occurs above @xmath11 , the upper band becomes relevant at around @xmath117 and particle - hole symmetry will be recovered above @xmath118 .",
    "this massless dirac spectrum also gives the novel @xmath7-dependence as described above .",
    "therefore it seems that the @xmath7-dependence observed in experiments suggests that the mott insulating picture is more appropriate for the high temperature phase . in other words ,",
    "the dirac fermion without the af gap is never relevant to the underdoped cuprates .",
    "this is also consistent with the asymmetry of arpes between hole - doped@xcite and electron - doped@xcite cuprates .",
    "recent experiments on ncco@xcite strongly suggest that the minima of the electron dispersion are at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and the particle - hole symmetry is broken .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the sdw picture with appropriate longer range hopping integrals @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath121 and @xmath122 is reversed when one consider the @xmath15-@xmath121-@xmath122-@xmath16 model for electron doped case , and the minimum at @xmath123 is recovered by self - consistent born approximation@xcite , and its results can be interpreted as the flux state with the af order@xcite .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider the flux state together with the af order , but does not without it .",
    "the af ordered state , on the other hand , can be well described in terms of the mean field state with the flux order . in this",
    "af state , the conventional behavior of the doped carriers are expected without the stripe formation .",
    "therefore the effects of the stripes are the most interesting issue .",

    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be due to the sample preparation .",
    "the longer time annealing has been done for the former case , while the sample is quenched in the latter case .",
    "therefore it is expected that the chain is more ordered in the former case , which might help the stripe formation . the 4-fold symmetry observed in the magnetoresistance@xcite",
