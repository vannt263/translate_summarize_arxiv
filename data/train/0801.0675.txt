    "heavy - quark physics is a corner stone in the ongoing effort to explore the standard model of elementary - particle interactions , to determine its parameters with greatest achievable precision , and to search for hints of departures from standard model predictions .",
    "thanks to an experimental program at various facilities worldwide that has spanned several decades , accompanied by steady progress in theory , there have been tremendous accomplishments in this field and several important discoveries have been made . while the standard model still stands as the most fundamental theoretical structure explaining the fundamental interactions of matter in the universe , the combined effort of energy - frontier and luminosity - frontier experiments in the coming decade is likely to shed light on the deep questions concerning the physics at the tera - scale  questions about the origin of mass , the asymmetry between matter and antimatter , and the nature of dark matter .",
    "one of the main challenges in heavy - quark physics is to disentangle the underlying , flavor - changing couplings of the quarks ( which in the standard model encode all information about cp violation ) from the less interesting but all dominating effects of the strong interactions , as described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "sophisticated theoretical tools going beyond the realm of perturbation theory are required to accomplish percent - level precision in the calculation of decay rates and kinematical distributions for the most interesting processes .",
    "some of the relevant tools and recent developments are discussed in this talk .",
    "before discussing specific applications it is important to summarize the theoretical tools we have for calculating decay rates and spectra in heavy - quark physics , and the concepts from which these tools derive .",
    "the underlying theme is the separation of short - distance from long - distance physics , which is natural due to the presence of the large mass scale @xmath7 , which is far above the scale of nonperturbative hadronic physics .",
    "factorization theorems state that short- and long - distance contributions to a given observable can be separated into wilson coefficient functions @xmath8 and nonperturbative matrix elements @xmath9 .",
    "generically , up to power corrections of the form @xmath10 one has @xmath11 such a factorization formula is useful , since by virtue of it the dependence on the high scale @xmath12 is calculable , and often the number of matrix elements @xmath9 is smaller than the number of observables that can be expressed in the form shown above . typically , this reduction is accomplished by means of some symmetry .",
    "the nonperturbative matrix elements can then be extracted from data or calculated using theoretical approaches such as lattice qcd or qcd sum rules .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath13 in ( [ fact1 ] ) serves as an auxiliary separator between the domains of short- and long - distance physics .",
    "observables are formally independent of the choice of @xmath13 ; however , they inherit some residual dependence once the wilson coefficients @xmath8 are computed at finite order in perturbation theory . the dependence gets weaker as higher orders in the perturbative expansion are included .",
    "the @xmath13-independence of the right - hand side of ( [ fact1 ] ) implies a renormalization - group equation for the functions @xmath8 , which can be solved . in the process",
    ", large perturbative logarithms of the form @xmath14 can be summed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the formal basis of the factorization formula ( [ fact1 ] ) is the ( euclidean ) operator product expansion .",
    "important examples of this type of factorization include the effective weak hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath15 which is the starting point of any calculation in quark flavor physics . in this case",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath8 contain short - distance physics associated with heavy standard model particles such as the top - quark , the electroweak gauge bosons , or the higgs boson .",
    "however , if there exists physics beyond the standard model involving some new heavy particles that couple to the standard model , then the wilson coefficients will unavoidably also be sensitive to the masses and couplings of these new particles .",
    "an important goal of flavor physics is to search for these kinds of effects .",
    "other important applications of the factorization theorem ( [ fact1 ] ) include the derivation of heavy - quark symmetry relations for the exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath16 @xcite , and the calculation of the total decay rate and differential distributions in the inclusive semileptonic decay @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "processes involving energetic light partons require a more sophisticated form of the factorization theorem , which generically can be expressed as @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the hard scale of the process , e.g. , a heavy - quark mass or the center - of - mass energy .",
    "the hard functions @xmath19 capture virtual effects from quantum fluctuations at the hard scale .",
    "the jet functions @xmath20 describe the properties of the emitted collinear particles , whose characteristic virtuality or invariant mass scales as an intermediate scale @xmath21 between @xmath22 and the qcd scale @xmath23 . here",
    "we will only be interested in inclusive processes , for which the jet scale is in the perturbative domain ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "finally , the soft functions @xmath25 describe the ( nonperturbative ) physics associated with soft radiation in the process .",
    "the symbol @xmath26 implies a convolution , which arises since the jet and soft functions share some common variables , such as some small momentum components of order @xmath23 .",
    "these convolutions require distribution functions ( as opposed to hadronic parameters ) as hadronic input .",
    "examples of such functions are parton distribution functions , light - cone distribution functions , and fragmentation functions .    the theoretical basis of the factorization theorem ( [ fact2 ] ) is a generalization of the euclidean operator product expansion to the time - like domain . while in the past factorization theorems such as ( [ fact2 ] ) were derived using diagrammatic methods @xcite , an elegant field - theoretic approach is offered by the soft - collinear effective theory developed in @xcite .",
    "the interactions of light , energetic particles and the associated emissions of soft and collinear radiation requires a description in terms of nonlocal operators , in which fields live on light - like trajectories following the paths of the energetic partons . as a result , this is a rather complicated effective field theory .",
    "however , once its power counting rules have been established , it is possible to classify operators by counting powers of @xmath27 .",
    "many important applications of the factorization theorem ( [ fact2 ] ) have been discussed in the literature . in jet physics",
    ", factorization applies , e.g. , to the cross sections for deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , drell - yan production @xcite , and to event shapes @xcite . in the realm of heavy - quark physics ,",
    "formula ( [ fact2 ] ) applies to the inclusive processes @xmath4 and @xmath0 , in which case the soft functions @xmath25 are referred to as shape functions @xcite .",
    "it also applies to exclusive semileptonic processes such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite , which have been studied in great detail using light - cone qcd sum rules ( for recent work , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "also , the qcd factorization approach to nonleptonic processes such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 relies on such a factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "some important recent accomplishments in this area have been the calculation of the hard - scattering kernels in the qcd factorization formula for rare hadronic decays of the form @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 are light pseudoscalar or vector mesons ) at @xmath35 @xcite , the proof of factorization for the decay @xmath32 @xcite , and the calculation of part of the @xmath35 corrections for this process  @xcite .",
    "any systematic theoretical approach has limitations , an understanding of which is necessary in order to gauge the accuracy of calculations and , more generally , understand what can and what can not be calculated in a model - independent way .",
    "an obvious practical limitation of any calculation is the need to truncate the perturbative expansion of the perturbative coefficients @xmath8 in ( [ fact1 ] ) , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 in ( [ fact2 ] ) .",
    "state of the art is to compute these objects at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in perturbation theory . even if it was possible to calculate the perturbative functions to all orders ( and of course we do not have the tools to accomplish this ! ) , then the asymptotic nature of perturbative expansions in quantum field theory would imply an irreducible ambiguity in the precision with which these functions can be determined , an ambiguity that scales like a power of @xmath27 . in order to do better ,",
    "it is necessary to include power - suppressed corrections in the calculation . in some cases such as",
    "the inclusive decays @xmath36 and @xmath0 , a factorization theorem such as ( [ fact2 ] ) can be shown to hold at any order in the expansion in @xmath37 @xcite ; however , starting already at first order in @xmath37 the number of unknown soft functions exceeds the number of observables .",
    "in other cases , such as the nonleptonic decays @xmath31 and @xmath38 , factorization breaks down beyond the leading power in @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "it follows from these remarks that observables very sensitive to higher - order perturbative effects or power corrections can not be predicted with high accuracy .",
    "well - known examples include some direct cp asymmetries for the decays @xmath31 and @xmath38 , and the branching fractions for some  color - suppressed \" decays such as @xmath39 .",
    "the fact that calculations are rather uncertain in these cases does not indicate a failure of the factorization framework ( which is rooted in quantum field theory and as such can not be questioned ) , but rather that in some cases the expansion in powers of @xmath40 and @xmath37 does not converge well .    before turning to phenomenological applications we should mention an ongoing theoretical debate on the question of the breakdown of factorization beyond the leading power in heavy - to - light transitions such as the @xmath41 form factor or hadronic processes such as @xmath38 .",
    "it is well known that a perturbative analysis of the form factor is plagued by  endpoint divergent \" convolution integrals @xcite .",
    "power corrections to the factorization formula for @xmath38 , which arise from processes such as  weak annihilation \" , give rise to similar endpoint divergences @xcite .",
    "it has recently been claimed that these divergences can be removed , and factorization be established , in a systematic way using so - called ",
    "0-bin \" subtractions combined with rapidity factorization @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this claim has not been supported by detailed calculations , and in my view it is unlikely that the problem can be solved following the approach described in that paper .",
    "nevertheless , based on these results it has been argued that weak annihilation amplitudes @xcite and power - suppressed penguin amplitudes @xcite should be real to a good approximation , i.e. , free of large soft rescattering phases . if true , this would have important implications for phenomenology . finally , the prediction of the qcd factorization approach that charm - penguin contributions to nonleptonic decay amplitudes factorize @xcite has been challenged in @xcite , and a rebuttal has been given in @xcite .",
    "more theoretical work on this important issue would be desirable .",
    "the remainder of this talk will focus on three important applications of heavy - quark theory : the calculation of the partial inclusive @xmath0 branching ratio at nnlo , the extraction of the @xmath1-quark mass from moments of inclusive decay spectra , and the determination of @xmath3 from inclusive @xmath4 decay distributions .",
    "new physics implications of @xmath0 decay have been discussed by g.  isidori and s.  heinemeyer at this conference , while determinations of @xmath3 from exclusive decays have been covered in the talks of e.  barberio and c.  davis . for a lack of time ,",
    "this is a very limited selection of topics from a vast range of possibilities .",
    "my apologies go to all those authors whose important contributions are omitted here .",
    "the decay @xmath0 is the prototype of a flavor - changing neutral current process . in the standard model it is mediated by loops involving heavy top quarks and @xmath42 bosons , and it is expected that yet unknown heavy particles , if they exist at the tev scale , could give contributions to the decay rate not much below the standard model level . a precise study of this process , both experimentally and theoretically , can thus serve as a precision test of the flavor sector and place constraints on the parameters of new physics models .",
    "indeed , it is by now broadly appreciated that the constraints on model building from processes such as @xmath0 can be as valuable as constraints from electroweak precision observables , astrophysical observations , and other low - energy observables such as electric dipole moments and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "about one year ago , the calculation of most nnlo contributions ( all that are believed to be significant ) to the @xmath0 decay rate has been completed , and a first prediction for the branching ratio has been derived in a paper by misiak at 16 coworkers @xcite .",
    "this has been a heroic effort , which would not have been possible without a large collaborative approach . at the same time , a dedicated , model - independent analysis of the effect of a cut on the photon energy , @xmath43 with @xmath44 in the range between 1.8 and 2gev as applied in the experimental analyses , has been performed @xcite .",
    "it is conventional ( yet somewhat artificial ) to write the branching ratio as @xmath45 , where the function @xmath46 describes the effect of the cut , while br(tot ) is the  total \" branching ratio ( which in practice refers to a very low cut @xmath47gev , since the total branching ratio does not exist ) .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the nnlo calculation of the total branching ratio .",
    "the first task was to compute the wilson coefficients in the effective weak hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) at nnlo .",
    "this required two - loop matching calculations for the coefficients @xmath48 at the weak scale @xcite and three - loop matching calculations for the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "these matching conditions are the place where new physics contributions would enter the theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "next , the wilson coefficients have to be evolved down to a scale @xmath51 using the renormalization group . as input",
    ", one needs the three - loop anomalous dimension matrices for the operators @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite , as well as the four - loop anomalous dimensions accounting for the mixing of @xmath52 into @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite . with these results at hand ,",
    "the second task was to compute the matrix elements of the various operators at nnlo .",
    "the full two - loop corrections to the matrix element of the leading dipole operator @xmath53 were obtained in @xcite . for the required three - loop matrix elements of the operators @xmath55 only an extrapolation in the mass of the charm - quark is available based on calculations performed in the artificial limit @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "one of the dominant uncertainties in the prediction results from this extrapolation .",
    "the remaining matrix elements are known at @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the resulting prediction for the total branching ratio in the standard model is @xcite @xmath58 the combined theoretical uncertainty results from a 3% error due to higher - order perturbative corrections , a 3% error in the extrapolation in the charm - quark mass , another 3% uncertainty from parameter variations ( from @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath40 etc . ) , and finally a 5% error assigned to account for nonperturbative power corrections to the total rate .",
    "the result ( [ bsgrate ] ) is a mile stone in the history of heavy - flavor theory .",
    "note that the largest contribution to the theoretical uncertainty is now due to our lack of control over nonperturbative power corrections .",
    "unfortunately , it will be very difficult if not impossible to reduce this error with current technology .",
    "a recent analysis has identified a new class of nonlocal power corrections to the total decay rate , which are described in terms of matrix elements of trilocal light - cone operators @xcite .",
    "naive model estimates of these effects point to a small reduction of the total rate with an uncertainty of 5% . however , this number is only a guess , and it is difficult to substantiate it .",
    "there are other , similar types of nonlocal contributions , which are currently being analyzed @xcite .    the presence of a cut @xmath43 on the photon energy , which is applied in order to reduce the background in all measurements of the @xmath0 branching ratio to date , leads to significant complications in the theoretical analysis .",
    "the reason is that it introduces a sensitivity to the low scale @xmath61gev , which is barely in the perturbative domain .",
    "one thus needs to deal with a complicated many - scale problem characterized by the hierarchy @xmath62 .",
    "a systematic framework for this situation is the multi - scale operator product expansion developed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the theoretical accuracy that can be achieved is _ not _ set by size of the expansion parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 , but rather by @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( though first - order corrections in this ratio are absent ) .",
    "a detailed analysis at nnlo comes to the conclusion that @xcite @xmath67 which tends to be a stronger suppression than that predicted by naive model estimates @xcite .",
    "the above number includes a perturbative uncertainty of @xmath68 , parameter dependences of 2% , and an error from power corrections of also 2% .    combining the results ( [ bsgrate ] ) and ( [ fe0 ] ) , one obtains the nnlo prediction",
    "@xcite @xmath69 it is consistent within errors with the result @xmath70 quoted in @xcite , which is based on a naive perturbative expansion in @xmath71 . for completeness",
    "we also quote the number @xmath72 obtained in @xcite using a renormalon - inspired model for the shape function in @xmath0 decay .",
    "note that the difference with respect to ( [ bsgfinal ] ) is primarily due to a larger total branching ratio obtained in this scheme , not so much due to the treatment of cut - related effects .",
    "the theoretical result ( [ bsgfinal ] ) for the branching ratio is about 1.4 standard deviations lower than the current world - average experimental value @xmath73 @xcite , indicating that there is some room for possible new physics effects .",
    "we emphasize , however , that to date no actual measurement has been performed with a cut as low as 1.6gev . indeed , the quoted experimental number involves a model - dependent extrapolation to low energy . in the future , it would be desirable if experiment and theory would be confronted at a value of @xmath44 that can indeed be achieved experimentally .",
    "the lowest such value at present is @xmath74gev .",
    "the operator product expansion allows for a model - independent calculation of moments of decay distributions in the inclusive semileptonic process @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "hadronic physics is encoded in a few parameters defined in terms of forward @xmath76-meson matrix elements of local operators .",
    "they are called @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) , etc .",
    "the most important parameters in the prediction are , however , the heavy - quark masses @xmath75 and @xmath60 . the only assumption underlying the theoretical calculations is that of quark - hadron duality . it is believed to be reliable for the relevant energy release @xmath81 .    traditionally , the parameters @xmath82 are extracted from a global fit to experimental data on moments of the lepton energy and invariant hadronic mass spectra in @xmath2 decay and of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath0 decay .",
    "the experimental data include measurements reported by the babar , belle , cleo , cdf , and delphi collaborations @xcite , while the theoretical calculations are based on formulae derived in @xcite .",
    "the global fit takes account of the strong correlations between the various quantities .",
    "the status of the theoretical calculations is such that the leading terms in the operator product expansion for the moments are know at @xmath57 but not yet at @xmath35 .",
    "power - suppressed contributions are only known at tree level .",
    "it will be important in the future to increase the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the technology for obtaining the complete @xmath35 corrections to the leading term exists @xcite , and it is expected that results will soon be published .",
    "also , the @xmath83 corrections to the leading power - suppressed effects , those proportional to the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath79 , are currently being calculated .",
    "results have already been published for the terms proportional to @xmath77 @xcite , but they have not yet been included in the fits .",

    "the most popular schemes are the kinetic scheme @xcite , the 1s scheme @xcite , and the shape - function scheme @xcite . while in principle",
    "it is merely a matter of choice which of these schemes one prefers , fitting in scheme  a and converting the results to scheme  b might give slightly different results from fitting directly in scheme  b , if truncated perturbative expressions are employed .",
    "this fact should be taken into account when deriving estimates for the theoretical uncertainties ; specifically , the quoted uncertainties should not be less than the uncertainties inherent in the scheme translations . to illustrate this point , we quote results derived by the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) for this conference .",
    "they obtain @xmath114gev from a fit performed in the kinetic scheme and @xmath115gev from a fit performed in the 1s scheme @xcite . on the other hand , translating the first number from the kinetic to the 1s scheme at @xmath57 would give @xmath116gev , which is about 1.5 standard deviations higher than the value obtained from the fit in the 1s scheme .",
    "this indicates that the uncertainty is larger than the 30mev quoted from the fit .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] collects results obtained by translating the central values @xmath117gev ( upper portion ) and @xmath118gev ( lower portion ) from the kinetic scheme into other schemes ( @xmath119 , 1s , and shape - function scheme ) .",
    "the formulae translating from one scheme to another involve perturbative expansions , and following common practice we choose to evaluate the coupling @xmath40 in these expansions at a scale @xmath13 varied between @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this results in the quoted uncertainties .",
    "a few comments are worth mentioning : first , note that the scale uncertainty from the conversion into the @xmath119 scheme remains significant even at two - loop order .",
    "this unfortunate fact prevents us from using the very precise value for @xmath85 recently obtained from an analysis of the total @xmath90 cross section in the threshold region @xcite to derive similarly precise values for the @xmath1-quark mass in other schemes .",
    "next , note that the value of @xmath75 at nlo in the 1s scheme has a tiny scale uncertainty , yet the value obtained at nnlo differs from the nlo value by more than 40mev .",
    "this illustrates that scale variation can sometimes underestimate the true theoretical uncertainty .",
    "finally , note that for the translation into the shape - function scheme two - loop corrections not associated with running coupling effects appear to be important .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to include the full @xmath35 corrections in the moment fit .",
    "a serious problem with the way the fit is currently performed by hfag is that besides the moments of semileptonic spectra in @xmath2 decay also moments of the @xmath0 photon energy spectrum are used .",
    "based on what we know about @xmath0 decay , this treatment can no longer be justified theoretically ! whereas a clean theoretical approach to the @xmath2 moments is provided by the operator product expansion , the theoretical basis for the calculation of the @xmath0 moments is far more complicated and subject to uncontrollable theoretical uncertainties .",
    "first , it is unquestionable that the existing measurements of the @xmath0 moments are performed in a kinematic region where shape - function effects are still important @xcite . to correct for these effects , a ( shape - function ) model - dependent  bias correction \" is applied to the data @xcite .",
    "more generally , it has now been established that as soon as operators other than the dipole operator @xmath53 are not ignored , then _ there is no local operator product expansion _ for the @xmath0 decay rate and moments , even outside the shape - function region @xcite .",
    "indeed , a novel factorization formula can be derived for the photon energy spectrum , which is graphically represented in figure  [ fig : theorem ] . besides a  direct photon \" contribution ( first term ) , there appear  single resolved \" and ",
    "double resolved photon \" contributions , which are impossible to calculate with present tools .",
    "their impact on the moments of the photon spectrum is currently under investigation .",
    "when the goal is to extract heavy - quark parameters such as @xmath75 in a model - independent way , one should thus not include the @xmath0 moments in the fit .",
    "an analysis based only on the @xmath2 moments leads to @xmath122gev in the kinetic scheme and @xmath123gev in the 1s scheme @xcite .",
    "the increase of the uncertainties can be understood by observing that in the combined fit there was s slight tension between the results from the @xmath2 and @xmath0 moments , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bfplot ] .",
    "the increased errors shown above more properly reflect the true uncertainties .",
    "these errors will be reduced ( perhaps to 3040mev ) once the @xmath35 and @xmath124 corrections will be included in the fit .",
    "when the new values for @xmath75 are translated into the shape - function scheme , one obtains @xmath125gev , which is larger than the value @xmath126gev used so far by hfag .",
    "this observation has important implications for the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "the theoretical basis for the analysis of differential decay distributions in the inclusive semileptonic process @xmath4 is a factorization formula of the form ( [ fact2 ] ) , in which the soft functions @xmath25 are generalized parton distribution functions for the @xmath76 meson called shape functions @xcite . the leading - order shape function is a universal , process - independent quantity , which also ( to a large extent ) determines the shape of the @xmath0 photon energy spectrum .",
    "the strategy is therefore to extract the shape function from the @xmath0 photon spectrum and then use this information to predict @xmath4 decay distributions @xcite .",

    "extracted from the @xmath2 moment fit .",
    "an alternative is to employ shape - function independent relations between weighted @xmath0 and @xmath2 spectra @xcite .",
    "both approaches are equivalent ; yet , not all predictions that have been obtained using the shape - function independent relations are up to the standard of present - day calculations .",
    "the elimination of background events from @xmath2 , in which the charm quark is misidentified , is accomplished by means of different experimental cuts .",
    "the most common ones are a cut @xmath127 on the hadronic invariant mass of the final state , a cut @xmath128 on the energy of the charged lepton , a cut @xmath129 on the invariant mass squared of the lepton - neutrino pair , or a cut @xmath130 on the plus component of the total momentum of the final - state hadrons .",

    "they include the recently calculated @xmath57 corrections to the decay rates @xcite , which were not yet available for blnp .",
    "on the other hand , no attempt is made to resum sudakov logarithms .",
    "the numerical results obtained using the ggou code are consistent with those of blnp in both their central values and error estimates .    in table",
    "[ tab : vub ] we compile results for @xmath3 obtained from various various experimental cuts .",
    "the data have been analyzed using the blnp approach .",
    "it is crucial to realize that these results depend very sensitively on the shape function used in the analysis , and in particular on its first moment , which is related to the @xmath1-quark mass .",
    "the coefficient @xmath132 given for each cut indicates how the partial rate scales with @xmath75 .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath3 thus scales like @xmath160 .",
    "the third column in the table shows results reported previously by hfag , which are based on using the old value @xmath161gev for the @xmath1-quark mass .",
    "following my request , hfag has now redone the analysis using the new value @xmath162gev obtained without including the @xmath0 moments in the global fit .",
    "the new combined average value is @xmath163 it is significantly lower than the previous value .",
    "a graphical representation of the individual determinations is shown in figure  [ fig : vub ] .",
    "note that there is rather good agreement among the different measurements . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", one would give preference to the extractions based on the most efficient cuts , such as the cuts on @xmath164 or @xmath131 ( not reported in the table ) .",
    "for these quark - hadron duality is expected to work best and , more importantly , the potential contamination from weak annihilation effects is minimal . averaging the babar and belle results derived form the @xmath164 cut , my personal  best guess \" for @xmath3 is @xmath165    the most important conclusion from this discussion is this : when only model - independent information is used to determine the @xmath1-quark mass and thereby derive constraints on the leading shape function , then the value extracted for @xmath3 from inclusive decays is in rather good agreement with that derived from exclusive decays .",
    "for instance , recent analyses of the @xmath166 distribution in @xmath28 decays using unquenched lattice qcd @xcite or light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite yield values in the range between @xmath167 , with uncertainties of about @xmath168 @xcite . in my view",
    "there is no obstacle to averaging the  inclusive \" and  exclusive \" results to obtain a single value for @xmath3 , but this is best done by hfag .",
    "an important theoretical challenge in heavy - flavor physics is to disentangle strong - interaction effects from the underlying weak - interaction transitions , which probe the flavor structure of the standard model and measure fundamental parameters such as the elements of the ckm matrix .",
    "tremendous progress in theory has been made based on heavy - quark expansions and factorization techniques combined with effective field - theory methods .",
    "thanks to these developments , and to the hard work of many theorists , we now have accurate predictions , including high - order perturbative effects and nonperturbative power corrections , for a number of important decay processes , including in particular the inclusive processes @xmath0 and @xmath169 .",
    "the  @xmath3 vs.  @xmath170 puzzle \" , i.e. , the fact that there used to be a tension between the determination of @xmath3 from inclusive semileptonic decays as compared with the indirect value inferred from the measurement of the angle @xmath171 of the unitarity triangle , is resolved when only model - independent information is used in the extraction of the @xmath1-quark mass and other heavy - quark parameters .",
    "the new value of @xmath3 obtained in this way is in good agreement with the determination from exclusive decays .",
    "i am grateful to the organizers of the 2007 lepton - photon symposium for the invitation to deliver this talk and for the flawless organization of this important conference .",
    "many thanks go to elisabetta barberio and francesca di lodovico , whose help was instrumental in getting the most up - to - date averages for @xmath75 and @xmath3 .      for a review , see : g.  buchalla , a.  j.  buras and m.  e.  lautenbacher , rev .",
