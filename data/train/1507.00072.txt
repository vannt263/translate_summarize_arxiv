    "this faraday rotation can also be well explained by a quantum mechanism @xcite .",
    "based on this quantum understanding faraday rotation has been proposed to detect quantum fluctuations @xcite , and induce giant phase modulation @xcite .",
    "giant optical faraday rotation has also been observed @xcite .",
    "the polarization rotation due to the faraday effect has been well studied for classical optical magnetometers but a corresponding discussion of the sensitivity limit is so far absent in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the sensitivity limit of a microwave version of a faraday magnetometer . in our scheme",
    "the polarization of microwave probe photons is rotated by an ensemble of spins coupled to a microwave cavity . by measuring the subsequent rotation of the photon s polarization",
    "we are able to detect a weak static magnetic field applied to the spins .",

    "the mw cavity also possesses @xmath6- and @xmath7-polarized modes which are degenerate in frequency . the two orthogonally polarized cavity modes couple to two separate transitions of spins contained in the cavity . when a weak static magnetic field is applied to the ensemble of spins it shifts the two transition energies up or down oppositely and subsequently causes different detunings between the transitions and the cavity modes .",

    "an ensemble of spins couples to a microwave ( mw ) cavity .",
    "the horizontal polarized mw field @xmath8 inputs into the mw cavity and then is reflected off the cavity ( @xmath9 ) to the detector . the output field reflected off the cavity is detected by the polarization resolving photon detector d. the polarization of the output field is rotated by an angle @xmath10 due to the faraday effect .",
    "the cavity has the resonance frequency @xmath11 and the intrinsic loss @xmath12 .",
    "the input mw field couples to the cavity with an external coupling rate @xmath13.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we now describe in more detail our scheme for magnetic field sensing . in the scheme an ensemble of nv centers couples to the mw cavity as shown in fig .",

    "this input field , @xmath8 , can be decomposed into @xmath6 and @xmath7-polarized components driving the cavity modes .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7-polarized cavity fields suffer different phase shift because they couple to different transition within the spin ensemble ( fig .",
