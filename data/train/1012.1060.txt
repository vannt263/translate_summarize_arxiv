    "in 1948 , casimir predicted an attractive force between metal plates arising from quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the advent of experimental measurements of casimir forces has stimulated a large interest in this field @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive studies of the casimir force both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "specifically , a multipole scattering method has been developed and used to compute this force between multiple objects of various shapes and electromagnetic properties @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows one to compute the casimir interaction in a multiple scattering scheme based on the scattering matrix of each object .",
    "the conceptual foundations of this approach can be traced back to earlier multiple scattering formalisms @xcite .    within this formalism",
    ", we should compute the logarithm of the determinant ( the @xmath0 formula ) of a certain matrix in order to compute the energy @xcite .",
    "this can be expanded in a series of _",
    "multiple reflections_. this is a particularly useful expansion in the casimir - polder limit for small - sized objects . in this limit , the first reflection gives the leading order contribution while higher reflections ( and partial waves ) are suppressed by higher powers of the objects length scale divided by the separation distance .",
    "it is not immediately clear that this would be a useful , or even sensible , expansion for a more general configuration far from this limit .",
    "however , a recent work @xcite on the casimir force between non - compact objects ( cones , wedges and plates ) necessitated the use of such expansion : in this application the partial waves are labeled by a _ continuous _ set of quantum numbers and thus it is not convenient to use the @xmath0 formula , which involves the determinant of a continuously labeled matrix , in its general form .",
    "the multiple reflections captures the @xmath0 formula as a sum over the trace of certain operators which is well - defined for continuous indices .",
    "remarkably , this expansion enjoys a rapid convergence in the number of multiple reflections regardless of any geometrical limit .",

    "the casimir interaction energy between two objects can be computed by using functional integral methods . in this approach ,",
    "the interaction can be described by charge and current multipoles which exist on each object , and are later integrated out to obtain an expression for the energy only in terms of the scattering properties of the objects .",
    "for example , for two objects @xcite @xmath1 where we replaced the logarithm of the determinant ( @xmath0 ) by the trace of the logarithm ( @xmath2 ) for the sake of convenience in the following discussion .",

    "the matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the translation matrices which capture the appropriate translations and rotations between the scattering bases for each object .",
    "equation  ( [ eq . trlog two body energy ] ) in this form is exact and can be used to compute the casimir forces between any two objects . however , as outlined in the introduction , there are cases where we have to expand the @xmath8 formula as a power series in @xmath9 @xmath10 this finds a simple interpretation by noting that each term includes one more reflection ( back and forth ) between the two objects .",

    "we study the convergence in a variety of cases in the next sections , but in the following discussion we focus on the derivation of multiple - reflection expansion in general . in principle , for three or more objects , we can find a @xmath11 expression which involves the scattering matrices of all objects but in a somewhat complicated form .",
    "an expression for the casimir energy for three objects , for example , is given in eq .",
    "( iii.27 ) of ref .  @xcite . for more objects ,",
    "the expression for the energy will be increasingly more complicated .    nevertheless , the @xmath11 formula can be expanded and organized in multiple reflections . for three objects , for example",
    ", the first few diagrams are listed in fig  [ fig - threebodydiagexp ] .",
    "+ one can see that the diagrammatic expansion is organized by a few simple rules .",
    "first we state the rules for the casimir interaction of an arbitrary number of objects . later in this section",
    "we derive these rules systematically .",
    "let us suppose that there are @xmath12 objects which are separated from each other in the vacuum .",
    "each diagram forms a closed loop which consists of a certain number of insertions of the objects , and these are drawn by the wavy lines .",

    "we are interested in the _ interaction _ of multiple objects , so we ignore the diagrams with a single insertion of the @xmath5-matrix .",

    "consider a diagram with @xmath13 insertions of the objects : we designate the objects by @xmath14 in the order that they appear in the diagram and represent the latter by @xmath15 $ ] .",

    "the multiple - reflection expansion is organized by the following rules :    \\1 .",
    "only _ different _ objects are connected by a link ; an object index is not succeeded by the same index .",

    "a diagram defined by @xmath15 $ ] is symmetric if it is identical to @xmath21 $ ] up to a cyclic transformation .",
    "the diagrams which are symmetric in both directions ( of the loops ) do not have an arrow and appear only once while those which are not , appear in pairs of opposite directions .",
    "let us define a subdiagram as a subset of the diagram which is interconnected .",
    "a diagram which is made from @xmath22 copies of the same subdiagram comes with a combinatoric factor of @xmath23 .",
    "for example , a diagram represented by @xmath24 $ ] with @xmath22 copies of @xmath25 should be multiplied by @xmath23 .",

    "the constant @xmath28 is the symmetry factor of the corresponding diagram and is determined by rule 3 .",
    "+   + these can be proved in general .",
    "we start from the partition function whose logarithm is proportional to the energy . using path - integral techniques , it is possible to express the partition function as a functional integral over charge - current multipoles , @xmath29 .",
    "this has been done in great detail in ref .",

    "note that @xmath34 is the scattering matrix of the object @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the translation between the objects @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "when integrated over the multipoles , the logarithm of the last equation gives the @xmath38 formula ( up to a normalization factor ) .",
    "instead of performing the functional integral , we will proceed as follows .",
    "the action ( or the exponent of the integrand of the functional integral ) defines a natural set of feynman rules by which we can organize the diagrammatic structure of the casimir energy .    heretofore , we consider the @xmath5-matrices to represent the vertices in the diagrams as they naturally describe the interaction ( of the electromagnetic waves ) with the objects .",
    "similarly , the translation matrices are represented by the links or the propagators which connect separate objects . for the sake of derivation of the diagrammatic rules",
    ", we consider a different set of conventions in the following discussion . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we use the same conventions as we defined earlier .",
    "+ note that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq . partition function ] ) is diagonal in the object indices .",
    "so , from a mathematical point of view , it is natural to consider it as a _",
    "feynman propagator_. the propagator is the inverse kernel , hence we must attribute a factor of @xmath34 to any propagating line can be absorbed in the definition of the multipoles @xmath29 and do not play a role here . ] .",
    "also , the multipoles are complex , so we must associate a direction or an arrow to the propagator .",
    "the second term in the exponent only connects the multipoles on separate objects ( it is off - diagonal in the object indices ) and so can be more appropriately considered as an _ interaction vertex_. these rules are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - feynmanrules ] . a typical diagram made from the latter rules",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig - afeynmandiagram ] .",
    "these diagrams are dual to the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig - twobodydiagexp ] and [ fig - threebodydiagexp ] , _",
    "i.e. , _ the objects are represented by lines and the translation matrices by the dashed external lines due to the different choice of conventions .",
    "the three rules which were stated earlier follow straightforwardly .",
    "rule 1 follows trivially because the translation matrix is off - diagonal .",
    "rule 2 holds because there is an arrow on the lines . therefore the two triangular diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig - threebodydiagexp ] , for example , are not equivalent - matrices and the translation matrices , one can easily see that the two triangular diagrams are related by complex conjugation .",
    "the energy is real because it involves the sum of these diagrams . ] .",
    "the same arrow can be drawn on the symmetric diagrams , however , the two directions of the arrow generate the same diagram and must be counted only once . for these diagrams ,",
    "the arrow is irrelevant and can be dropped .",
    "finally rule 3 follows because the cyclic symmetry of diagrams requires a symmetry factor of @xmath23 .     after discussing the convergence of the expansion in the following section",
    ", we will give some applications of the multiple - reflection expansion . to show the strength of this method",
    ", we consider the interaction of edges among themselves and with dipoles .",
    "the analytical results we will find should be of both theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that , at least formally , the casimir energy can be expanded in a series of multiple reflections , or _ diagrams _ , which can be organized by a few simple rules .",
    "in this section , although lacking a general proof , we argue that under very generic circumstances the lowest orders of reflections dominate the casimir energy .",

    "it is instructive to compute the force order by order in multiple reflections .",
    "the contributing diagrams are given in fig .",
    "[ fig - twobodydiagexp ] .",
    "the @xmath5-matrix for the ( perfectly reflecting ) plates is @xmath45 where @xmath30 is the imaginary frequency , and the @xmath5-matrix of the magnetic ( m ) and the electric ( e ) polarizations correspond to the upper and lower signs respectively .",
    "one can then easily see that a diagram with @xmath22 insertions of the plate 1 and @xmath22 insertions of the plate 2 contributes to the energy by @xmath46 this result was noted earlier in the application of the optical approximation to parallel plate geometry , where the `` reflections '' are literally the specular reflections of ray optics @xcite .",
    "so the contribution of the higher reflections to the force falls off in a power - law fashion . in three dimensions ,",
    "the latter converges as @xmath47 . if the plates are dielectric as opposed to perfect reflectors , the multiple - reflection expansion of the force converges even more rapidly .",
    "note that the @xmath5-matrix of a plate remains diagonal ( in the planar wave basis ) at finite conductivity .",
    "the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the @xmath5-matrix can be shown to be less than ( or equal to ) unity for any dielectric response , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath48 at imaginary frequency .",
    "the latter can be used to find a bound on the contribution of the @xmath22-th order diagram as expanded in fig .",
    "[ fig - twobodydiagexp ] , @xmath49    casimir s computation of perfectly reflecting plates can also be altered by changing the geometry while keeping the perfect reflectivity intact .",
    "let us consider a wedge opposite a plate in three dimensions , which was extensively studied in ref .",
    "the expansion in multiple reflections is found to be governed approximately by a power law @xmath50 for a positive @xmath51 which is a function of the opening angle and the orientation of the wedge .",
    "so the convergence is more rapid than parallel plates .",
    "the perfectly reflecting plate - plate and wedge - plate configurations are both scale invariant , _",
    "i.e. _ , their only length scale is the separation distance between the two objects .",
    "therefore , the convergence in multiple reflection is not controlled by any dimensionless factor and is purely numerical .",
    "now we consider a geometry which provides an internal length scale .",
    "the interaction of a sphere of radius @xmath52 with a plate at a distance @xmath42 in three dimensions can be studied in various regimes . if the separation distance is small ( @xmath53 , _ proximity force approximation _ ( pfa ) can be used to compute the force @xcite .",
    "this approximation is based on treating the objects locally as parallel plates and integrating over the surfaces facing each other by using eq .",
    "( [ eq . parallel plates force ] ) . in the close proximity limit",
    ", pfa becomes exact .",
    "so by analogy with parallel plates , the convergence is governed by @xmath47 series in the limit of small sphere - plate separation . in the opposite limit where the sphere is small ( @xmath54 ) , the energy is dominated by the dipole interaction @xcite . in fact , the lowest reflection in the leading order of partial waves gives a force which is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the contribution of the higher reflections is exponentially suppressed : the @xmath22-th order diagram as expanded in fig .",
    "[ fig - twobodydiagexp ] becomes proportional to @xmath56 in the leading order of partial waves .    in summary , the expansion in multiple reflections appears to converge rapidly : in close proximity ( the absence of a small parameter ) , the convergence is governed by a power law and is purely numerical whereas in the opposite limit , the convergence is exponential and is controlled by the ratio of the object s length scale divided by the separation distance .",
    "intuitively , the convergence in reflections can be understood as follows .",
    "more reflections typically travel over a larger optical path .",
    "note that in the @xmath22-th reflection , the length of a typical path traveled by the waves between two parallel plates is @xmath57 .",

    "a two dimensional model of the repulsion involves a small elliptical perfect metal above a ( perfect ) metal line with a gap ( see fig .  [ fig - ellipsetwohalflines ] ) .",
    "the casimir force is then computed based on 2d electromagnetism .",
    "as formulated in the appendix , the electromagnetism in two dimensions ( two spatial dimensions plus time ) with perfectly - conducting boundary condition is equivalent to a scalar field theory with neumann boundary condition .",
    "we exploit this fact to compute the interaction between an edge and a needle ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ellispehalfline ] ) .",
    "the interaction can be expanded in multiple reflections as in fig .",
    "[ fig - twobodydiagexp ] .",
    "the lowest order will suffice because the ellipse ( needle ) is small compared to the separation distance @xcite . in order to compute this diagram ,",
    "we must know scattering properties of these objects .",
    "the half - plate s @xmath5-matrix is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq . half plate t - matrix ] ) .",
    "the @xmath5-matrix of the ellipse can be described in the cylindrical coordinates where a natural basis is @xmath98 .",
    "the scattering matrix is then labeled in this basis , hence @xmath99 . in the limit of a small ellipse with neumann boundary condition",
    "we need a subset @xmath100 of the scattering matrix .",
    "this is further simplified by noting the inversion symmetry of the ellipse which requires @xmath101 to be even ; so @xmath102 is decoupled from @xmath103",
    ". therefore , the only nonzero components of the @xmath5-matrix in this subset are @xmath104 and @xmath99 for @xmath105 .",
    "using parity , the latter components of the @xmath5-matrix ( with @xmath106 ) can be written as a superposition of @xmath107 and @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath83 are the symmetry axes of the ellipse .",
    "for a small object , we need the @xmath5-matrix to be expanded to the lowest order in the wave number @xmath30 , in which limit they all depend quadratically on @xmath30 , that is @xmath110 .",
    "we leave the @xmath111 s as parameters without specializing to an ellipse the discussion applies to any geometry with the same symmetry properties as an ellipse .",
    "the @xmath5-matrix of the half - line is given in planar basis while that of the needle is defined in the cylindrical basis .",
    "we can convert the two bases by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath67 are the angles of @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .",
    "so the _ conversion _ matrix is @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath5-matrix of the needle can be then cast in the planar basis using the conversion matrix and the normalization factors which are involved in the definition of these functions @xcite @xmath117    now we can put everything together to compute the casimir interaction energy of a half - line and a needle .",
    "the objects are separated by a distance @xmath39 along the needle - edge axis with respect to which the needle makes an angle @xmath118 and the half - line is tilted at an angle @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ellispehalfline ] ) .",
    "the energy finds contributions from different components of the @xmath5-matrix . for each contribution to the casimir interaction ,",
    "we can find exact analytical formulae .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath120 is @xmath121 where @xmath122 indicates that this result is exact in the limit of a vanishing needle .",
    "it is not surprising that this expression does not depend on @xmath118 since the lowest partial wave ( which is denoted by 0 ) does not detect the orientation of the needle .",
    "the dependence on the separation distance is obvious for dimensional reasons .",
    "the dependence on the tilt angle , however , is nontrivial .",
    "interestingly when the half - line is aligned with the axis which connects it to the needle , this term becomes zero  irrespective of the separation distance .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in the next section .",
    "the dependence on the orientation of the needle comes through @xmath123 and @xmath124 and is given by @xmath125 and , by symmetry , @xmath126 the sum of these expressions give the interaction of a needle with a half - line .",
    "the last equation is a consequence of the symmetries of the problem .",
    "note that these expressions all come with the same dependence on the separation distance ; so in principle they are all important at the leading order .",
    "a simple consistency check is that the sum @xmath127 must be independent of the orientation @xmath118 .",
    "that is because it gives the interaction of a circle  as opposed to an ellipse  with the half - line .",
    "[ ? ]    it is interesting that the complicated interaction of a _ needle _ with an _ edge _ can be described analytically",

    "@xcite in three dimensions . in another limit , @xmath129",
    ", the needle is aligned along the axis of the half - line , in which case the orientation - dependent terms , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , exhibit unusual characteristics as a function of the orientation which will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "note that in the same limit , @xmath132 vanishes .    here",
    "we assume that the needle is elongated in one direction .",
    "choosing this axis to be @xmath83 , we can then neglect @xmath130 .",
    "also the contribution from @xmath132 is significantly smaller than the orientation dependent terms ; so the total energy is given by @xmath131 without any loss of generality .",
    "the absolute value of the force ( derived from eqs .",
    "( [ eq . exx ] ) and ( [ eq . eyy ] ) ) as a function of the needle orientation for @xmath129 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ plot - forceyy ] .",
    "the force is symmetric with respect to @xmath79 as it should be .",
    "but it also vanishes at this point .",
    "this was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is explained by employing an intuitive argument .",
    "figure  [ plot - forceyy2 ] gives the magnitude of the force for a set of different angles .",
    "away from @xmath129 the force is non - vanishing but it shows a strong dependence on the angle @xmath118 .",
    "the direction of the force also exhibits some interesting features .",
    "let us consider several points all at the same distance from the edge .",
    "we    show the direction ( and the relative magnitude of the force ) in a small circle around each point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - forceyydirection ] ) . an arrow drawn from a point on the circle",
    "should be understood as the force on the needle which is pointed from the center of the circle to that point .",
    "the force is normalized within each circle but differently from other circles .",
    "the small needle drawn in each circle is the equilibrium configuration at each point .",
    "this plot illustrates some characteristics of the interaction of an _ edge _ with a _",
    "needle _ :    \\1 .",
    "there is a strong dependence on the orientation of the needle .",
    "both the magnitude and direction of the force vary strongly .",
    "in fact , when @xmath129 the _ dipole _ drags the force direction along with itself ( parallel to its orientation ) .    \\2 . the vertical component of the force does not always point towards the half - line . for @xmath133 ,",
    "for example , we can see that for a certain range of the orientation @xmath118 , the ( vertical ) force points upward . this will be essential to the argument in the next section .",
    "\\3 . the equilibrium configuration ( the point of zero torque )",
    "strongly depends on @xmath119 , the relative positioning of the two objects .      in this section ,",
    "we follow the setup in ref .",
    "@xcite and consider the interaction between a vertical needle and a line with a gap , _ or _ two half - lines ( see fig .  [ fig - ellipsetwohalflines ] ) .",
    "the two - body interaction of a half - line with an ellipse was computed in the previous section .",
    "here we also consider higher refections . because the ellipse is small in size",
    ", it will suffice to consider only a single reflection off of it .",
    "but higher reflections from the half - lines should be included . the three - body diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig - repulsiondiagrams ] is an example .",
    "we will find that the latter diagrams are also significantly smaller than the two - body diagrams .",
    "this again proves the usefulness of the expansion in multiple reflections .",
    "figure  [ fig - repulsiondiagrams ] summarizes these statements . as a result",
    ", we can very precisely describe the interaction as the sum of the two - body diagrams .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq . exx ] ) and ( [ eq . eyy ] ) , the energy takes the form @xmath134 this expression is plotted as the bold ( blue ) curve in fig .",
    "[ plot - repulsionenergy ] where it has been also compared with the case where the needle was positioned horizontally ( red curve ) .",
    "the dashed curve belongs to a circle of the same diameter as the needle and is simply obtained by summing the values of the other two curves .",
    "note that the contribution due to @xmath120 is smaller by one order magnitude which is why it is neglected .",
    "the interesting point about the bold curve , also discussed in the previous section , is that it vanishes for @xmath135 .",
    "the energy , however , is always negative so the force on a vertical needle in the proximity of the gap is actually repulsive .",
    "this observation has been used to propose a mechanism of obtaining repulsion in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the force on a horizontally - positioned needle or a circle is never repulsive .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ plot - repulsionforce ] .",
    "we also include the corrections to the force due to higher order reflections .",
    "the dots include the first correction from the three - body diagrams which is extremely small compared to the leading order ( shown by the solid and dashed curves ) .",
    "again this shows that a systematic expansion of multiple reflections gives a remarkably accurate result .    the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig - ellipsetwohalflines ] gives rise to repulsion , but it is unstable with respect to the rotations in the plane . also according to the theorem in ref .",
    "@xcite , it should be unstable with respect to the displacement in the horizontal direction .",
    "in this work , we have developed a multiple - reflection expansion of the casimir interaction .",
    "we have represented the latter in a diagrammatic fashion and derived simple rules to organize and consistently expand it .    we have argued that the formal diagrammatic expansion converges rapidly and thus it is sufficient to keep only the lowest order diagrams in the number of reflections .",
    "we have explicitly shown the latter for various configurations . specifically , the interaction between edges ( of half - plates ) among themselves and with a needle has been computed .",
    "most notably , we have found an analytical expression describing the interaction of two half - plates in the lowest reflection , that should be accurate for practical applications .",
    "three - body interactions of half - plates are considered where we have taken advantage of the remarkable convergence in multiple reflections .",
    "finally the interaction between edges and a needle is studied to find analytical formulae .",
    "the results have been used for an analytic treatment of a model of repulsion which has been proposed recently .    a more rigorous bound on the convergence of higher order diagrams is still desired for both two - body and multibody configurations .",
    "the expansion in the lowest reflections can be a basis for both numerical and analytical studies of complex multibody configurations and geometries .",
    "the rapid convergence in diagrammatic expansion can lead to a remarkable simplification of the intensive computations .",
