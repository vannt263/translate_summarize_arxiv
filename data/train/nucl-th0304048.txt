    "( [ 24 ] ) to the value in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) comes from the core polarization .",
    "the last remark concerns the pairing effects .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0hg has 7 neutron holes in the unfilled shell .",
    "one of them is fixed in @xmath147 state and 6 others should be distributed among the other states in the shell . from mass differences we found @xmath148 mev .",
    "this value of the pairing gap is typical for developed pairing . for dipole transitions the transition energy is large compared to @xmath149 and",
    "the pairing effects are small .",

    "( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "for the induced moment the situation is different .",

    "such transitions exist inside the last unfilled neutron shell and , due to pauli blocking , they are sensitive to the details of the shell occupation . for a t - odd operator the effects of pairing in the core polarization can be considered in the way used in ref .",
    "we found , that the main effect of pairing is in fixing the occupation numbers in the upper unfilled neutron shell .",
    "as soon as we keep the occupation numbers fixed the results for @xmath68 are changed within few percents when we put @xmath152 .    in summary , we calculated the schiff moment of @xmath0hg nucleus using finite range weak interaction and considering the core polarization effects .",
    "the effects of the finite interaction range are not very significant for the mercury nucleus .",
    "they do not change the order of magnitude of the schiff moment calculated with the contact interaction .",
    "the effects of the core polarization are two - fold .",
    "first , they renormalize the bare operator of the schiff moment producing a small neutron component due to n - p residual interaction .",
    "second , they produce an induced schiff moment due to p- and t- violation component in the intermediate single particle states . the induced moment is proportional to both the strong residual and the weak interactions .",
    "the effects of the core polarization for the mercury nucleus are large and they have to be accounted in calculations of p- and t - violating effects in the mercury nucleus .",
