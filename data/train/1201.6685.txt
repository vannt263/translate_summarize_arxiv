    "<S> the problem of clock offset estimation in a two way timing message exchange regime is considered when the likelihood function of the observation time stamps is gaussian , exponential or log - normally distributed . </S>",
    "<S> a parametrized solution to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation of clock offset , based on convex optimization , is presented , which differs from the earlier approaches where the likelihood function is maximized graphically . in order to capture the imperfections in node oscillators , which may render a time - varying nature to the clock offset , a novel bayesian approach to the clock offset estimation </S>",
    "<S> is proposed by using a factor graph representation of the posterior density . </S>",
    "<S> message passing using the max - product algorithm yields a closed form expression for the bayesian inference problem . </S>",
    "<S> several lower bounds on the variance of an estimator are derived for arbitrary exponential family distributed likelihood functions which , while serving as stepping stones to benchmark the performance of the proposed clock offset estimators , can be useful in their own right in classical as well bayesian parameter estimation theory . to corroborate the theoretical findings , </S>",
    "<S> extensive simulation results are discussed for classical as well as bayesian estimators in various scenarios . it is observed that the performance of the proposed estimators is fairly close to the fundamental limits established by the lower bounds .    </S>",
