    "primitive shape extraction from data is a recurrent problem in many research fields such as archeology @xcite , medicine @xcite , mobile robotics @xcite , motion capture @xcite and computer vision @xcite .",
    "this process is of primary importance since it provides a high level information on the data structure .",
    "first works focused on the case of 2d shapes ( lines , circles ) , but recent technologies enable to work with three dimensional data .",
    "for instance , in computer vision , depth sensors provide 3d point clouds representing the scene in addition to usual color images . in this work , we are interested in the estimation of the center @xmath0 and the radius @xmath1 of a sphere from a set of 3d noisy data . in practical applications ,",
    "only a discrete set of noisy measurements is available .",
    "moreover , sample points are usually located only near a portion of the spherical surface .",
    "two kinds of problem can be distinguished : shape detection and shape fitting .",
    "shape detection consists in finding a given shape in the whole data without any prior knowledge on which observations belong to it . in that case",
    ", the data set may represent several objects of different nature and may therefore contain a high number of outliers .",
    "two main methods are used in practise to solve this problem .",
    "the hough transform @xcite performs a discretization of the parameter space .",
    "each observation is associated to a set of parameters corresponding to all possible shapes that could explain the sample point .",
    "then , a voting strategy is applied to select the parameter vectors of the detected shapes .",
    "the advantage of this method is that several instances of the shape can be detected .",
    "however , a large amount of memory is required to discretize the parameter space , especially in the case of three dimensional models .",
    "the ransac ( random sample consensus ) paradigm @xcite is a probabilistic method based on random sampling .",
    "observations are randomly selected among the whole data set and candidate models are generated .",
    "then , shapes can be detected thanks to an individual scoring scheme .",
    "the success of the method depends on a given probability related to the number of sampling and the fraction of points belonging to the shape .",
    "the shape fitting problem assumes that all the data points belong to the shape .",
    "for example , spherical fitting techniques have been used in several domains such as industrial inspection @xcite , gps localization @xcite , robotics @xcite and 3d modelling @xcite .",
    "geometric and algebric methods have been proposed @xcite for parameters estimation .",
    "moreover , let us note that fitting methods are generally applied for shape detection as a post - processing step in order to refine the parameters of the detected shapes @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper , brazey and portier @xcite introduced a new spherical probability density function belonging to the family of elliptical distributions , and designed to model points spread near a spherical surface .",
    "this probability density function depends on three parameters , namely a center @xmath0 , a radius @xmath1 and a dispersion parameter @xmath2 . in their paper , the model is formulated in a general form in @xmath3 . to estimate @xmath4 and @xmath5 , a backfitting algorithm ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    "similar to the one used in @xcite is employed .",
    "a convergence result is given in the case of the complete sphere .",
    "however , no result is established in the case of a truncated sphere while simulations showed the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "the objective of this work is to propose a new algorithm to fit a sphere on a noisy 3d point cloud distributed around a complete or a truncated sphere .",
    "we shall assume that the observations are independent realizations of a random vector @xmath6 defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive real random variable such that @xmath9 , @xmath10 is uniformly distributed on a measurable subset @xmath11 of the unit sphere of @xmath12 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 are independent .",
    "parameters @xmath0 and @xmath13 are respectively the center and the radius of the sphere we are trying to adjust to the point cloud .",
    "random variable @xmath8 allows to model the fluctuations of points in the normal direction of the sphere . when @xmath11 coincides with the complete sphere , then the distribution of @xmath6 is spherical ( see e.g. @xcite ) . indeed , if we set @xmath14 , then the distribution of @xmath15 is rotationally invariant .",
    "we are interested in estimating center @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 . as @xmath16",
    ", we easily deduce from ( [ model_intro ] ) that @xmath17   \\label{equation_mu}\\\\ r   & = & \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\norm{x - \\mu}\\right ] . \\label{equation_r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that from these two equations , we can not deduce explicit estimators of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 using the method of moments since each parameter depends on the other . to overcome this problem",
    ", we can use a backfitting type algorithm ( as in @xcite ) or introduce a recursive stochastic algorithm , which seems well - suited for this problem since equations ( [ equation_mu ] ) and ( [ equation_r ] ) can also be derived from the local minimization of the following quadratic criteria @xmath18    stochastic algorithms , and more precisely robbins - monro algorithms , are effective and fast methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they do not need too much computational efforts and can easily be updated , which make of them good candidates to deal with big data for example",
    ". however , usual sufficient conditions to prove the convergence of this kind of algorithm are sometimes not satisfied and it is necessary to modify the basic algorithm .",
    "we can , for example , introduce a projected version of the robbins - monro algorithm which consists in keeping the usual estimators in a nice subspace with the help of a projection . such an algorithm has been recently considered in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , due to the non global convexity of function @xmath19 , we estimate parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 using a projected robbins - monro algorithm .",
    "we also propose an averaged algorithm which consists in averaging the projected algorithm . in general , this averaged algorithm allows to improve the rate of convergence of the basic estimators , or to reduce the variance , or not to have to make a good choice of the step sequence , which can be as exhaustive as to estimate the parameters .",
    "it is widely used when having to deal with robbins - monro algorithms ( see @xcite or @xcite amoung others ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we specify the framework and assumptions . after a short explanation on the non - convergence of the robbins - monro algorithm , the projected algorithm and its averaged version are introduced in section  3 .",
    "section 4 is concerned with the convergence results .",
    "some simulation experiments are provided in section 5 , showing the efficiency of the algorithms .",
    "proofs of the different results are postponed in appendix .",
    "we consider in this paper a more general framework than the one described in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath6 be a random vector of @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 denotes the distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 can be decomposed under the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath13 , @xmath8 is a positive real continuous random variable ( and with a bounded density if @xmath25 ) , @xmath10 is uniformly distributed on a measurable subset @xmath11 of the unit sphere of @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , let us suppose that @xmath8 and @xmath10 are independent .",
    "model ( [ def_x ] ) allows to model a point cloud of @xmath20 spread around a complete or truncated sphere of center @xmath24 and radius @xmath13 .",
    "random vector @xmath10 defines the position of the points on the sphere and random variable @xmath8 defines the fluctuations in the normal direction of the sphere . as mentioned in the introduction , when @xmath11 is the complete unit sphere , then the distribution of @xmath6 is spherical .",
    "when @xmath8 satisfies the condition @xmath26 , the radius @xmath5 is identifiable and can be directly estimated . indeed , since @xmath16 , then @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however , this condition is sometimes not satisfied ( as in @xcite ) and only @xmath29 can be estimated . therefore , in what follows , we are interested in estimating @xmath30 , which will be denoted by @xmath31 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we suppose from now that the following assumptions are fulfilled :    * * assumption [ a1 ] .",
    "* the random vector @xmath6 is not concentrated around @xmath4 : @xmath32 + * * assumption [ a2 ] . *",
    "the random vector @xmath6 admits a second moment : @xmath33    these assumptions ensure that the values of @xmath6 are concentrated around the sphere and not around the center @xmath4 , without in addition too much dispersion .",
    "this framework totally corresponds to the real situation that we want to model .",
    "moreover , using ( [ def_x ] ) , assumptions [ a1 ] and [ a2 ] reduce to assumptions on @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , [ a1 ] reduces to @xmath34 and [ a2 ] to @xmath35 .",
    "let us now introduce two examples of distribution allowing to model points spread around a complete sphere and satisfying assumptions [ a1 ] and [ a2 ] .",
    "[ exampleun ] let us consider a random vector @xmath6 taking values in @xmath20 with a distribution absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , with a probability density function @xmath36 defined for all @xmath37 by @xmath38 } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the normalization constant .",
    "then , we can rewrite @xmath6 under the form ( [ def_x ] ) with @xmath40 , @xmath41)$ ] and @xmath26 for any @xmath42 .    [ exampledeux ]",
    "let us consider the probability density function introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is defined for any @xmath43 by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the normalization constant .",
    "then , a random vector @xmath6 with probability density function @xmath46 can be rewritten under the form ( [ def_x ] ) , with @xmath47 , but @xmath48 is closed to @xmath49 when the variance @xmath50 is negligible compared to the radius @xmath5 .    to obtain points distributed around a truncated sphere , it is sufficient to modify the previous densities by considering densities of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the set of points of @xmath20 whose polar coordinates are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 defines the convex part @xmath11 of the surface of the unit sphere of @xmath20 we want to consider .",
    "we present in this section two algorithms for estimating the unknown parameter @xmath55 which can be seen as a local minimizer ( under conditions ) of a function .",
    "indeed , let us consider the function @xmath56 defined for all @xmath57 by @xmath58 where we denote by @xmath59 the function defined for any @xmath60 and @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "the function @xmath19 is frechet - differentiable and we denote by @xmath63 its gradient , which is defined for all @xmath64 by @xmath65 = \\begin{pmatrix } z- \\mathbb{e}\\left [ x \\right ] -a\\,\\mathbb{e } \\cro{\\dfrac{z - x}{\\| z - x \\| } } \\\\",
    "a- \\mathbb{e}\\cro{\\| z - x \\|}. \\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ def_x ] ) and definition of @xmath66 , we easily verify that @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath55 is a local minimizer of function @xmath19 ( under assumptions ) or a zero of @xmath68 , an idea could be to introduce a stochastic gradient algorithm for estimating @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random vectors of @xmath20 following the same law as @xmath6 and let @xmath70 be a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers satisfying the usual conditions @xmath71 when the functional @xmath19 is convex or verifies nice properties , a usual way to estimate the unknown parameter @xmath55 is to use the following recursive algorithm @xmath72 with @xmath73 chosen arbitrarily bounded .",
    "the term @xmath74 can be seen as an estimate of the gradient of @xmath19 at @xmath75 , and the step sequence @xmath76 controls the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "the convergence of such an algorithm is often established using the robbins - siegmund s theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) and a sufficient condition to get it , is to verify that for any @xmath77 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the usual inner product and @xmath80 the associated norm .",
    "however , we can show that this condition is only satisfied for @xmath81 belonging to a subset of @xmath82 to be specified .",
    "thus , if at time @xmath83 , the update of @xmath84 ( using ( [ alg_robmonro ] ) ) leaves this subset , then it does not necessarily converge .",
    "therefore , we have to introduce a projected robbins - monro algorithm .",
    "let @xmath85 be a compact and convex subset of @xmath86 containing @xmath87 and let @xmath88 be a projection satisfying @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the frontier of @xmath85 .",
    "an example will be given later .",
    "then , we estimate @xmath55 using the following projected robbins - monro algorithm ( prm ) , defined recursively by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is arbitrarily chosen in @xmath85 , and @xmath93 is a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers satisfying ( [ cond_gamma ] ) .",
    "of course the choice of subset @xmath85 and projector @xmath94 is crucial .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath85 is poorly chosen for a given projector , the convergence of the projected algorithm towards @xmath55 will be slower , even if from a theoretical point of view , we shall see in the next section dedicated to the theoretical results , that this algorithm is almost the same as the traditional robbins - monro algorithm since the updates of @xmath95 , ie .",
    "the quantities @xmath96 , leave @xmath85 only a finite number of times .",
    "let us now discuss the choice of @xmath85 and @xmath94 .",

    "[ propfortconv ] assume that [ a1 ] to [ a3 ] hold .",
    "then , there is a positive constant @xmath112 such that for all @xmath113 , @xmath114    the proof is given in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "assumption [ a3 ] is therefore crucial but only technical .",
    "it reflects the fact that the sphere is not too much truncated and that the points are not too far away from the sphere which corresponds to the real situations we want to model .",
    "in a general framework , this technical assumption is difficult to verify since it requires to specify the distribution of @xmath6 . in the case of distribution of example [ exampleun ] with @xmath115",

    "it is quite more difficult when dealing with distribution of example [ exampledeux ] .",
    "nevertheless , topological results can ensure that these constants exist .    from constants @xmath98 and @xmath99 of assumption [ a3 ] ,",
