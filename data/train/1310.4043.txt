    "measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) originally proposed in @xcite is a framework for quantum computation in which unitary transformations are implemented by measuring qubits of multipartite entangled states .",
    "the multipartite entangled states used as resources in mbqc are characterized by graphs specifying to which pairs of qubits entangling operations have been performed to prepare the state and are called graph states  @xcite .",
    "the total number of qubits in the graph state is larger than the number of qubits to which unitary transformations are applied .",
    "the graph state extends the `` work - space '' for quantum computation , although the action on the work - space is limited to single - qubit operations ( measurements ) .",
    "thus they can be regarded as a _",
    "resource for quantum computation .    in mbqc , the choice of a graph state and measurements , which is referred to as a _ measurement pattern _",
    ", specifies the implemented unitary transformation .",
    "the choice of measurements depends on the outcomes of previous measurements in order to counter nondeterministic state transformations caused by these measurements .",
    "such measurements are called as feed - forward measurements .",
    "the temporal order of measurements should be carefully chosen to guarantee deterministic implementation of unitary transformations .",
    "the quantum depth of a measurement pattern is determined as the minimum number of steps required for preparing a graph state and for performing the feed - forward measurements when any measurements that are not temporally ordered can be performed in a single step .",
    "quantum depth of a quantum circuit which does not include classically controlled operations depending on measurement outcomes is defined as the number of elementary gates included in the longest dependent sequence of gates in that circuit .",
    "thus the depth can be regarded as a _ temporal _ resource for quantum computation .    for several algorithms including the approximate quantum fourier transformation @xcite , it has been shown that mbqc requires smaller quantum depth than a variation of the quantum circuit model without classically controlled operations depending on measurement outcomes @xcite .",
    "this advantage of mbqc originates from the constant - time implementability of any sequence of clifford gates @xcite due to the extended work - space by using ancillary qubits of graph states and the feed - forward measurements . in this case",
    ", we can see that the spatial resource ( ancillary qubits ) is used for reducing the temporal resource ( the quantum depth ) .",
    "flow @xcite and generalized flow ( or _ gflow _ for short ) @xcite are ordering relations on a graph that guarantee the existence of a proper ordering of the measurements required for a deterministic implementation of a unitary transformation by a measurement pattern irrespective of the choices of measurement angles .",
    "if flow or gflow exists on a graph , it determines the ordering of measurements , and thus gives an upper bound for the quantum depth of measurement patterns on the graph .",
    "these upper bounds are called the depth of flow and gflow , respectively .",
    "the depth of gflow on a graph is lower than the depth of flow on the same graph , since gflow is a generalization of flow .",
    "there are graphs which have gflow but do not have flow for the same reason .    given a quantum circuit decomposition of a unitary transformation",
    ", we can construct a measurement pattern with depth of flow equal or less than the quantum depth of the original circuit @xcite .",
    "this implies that the depth of flow , and so the depth of gflow , already takes into account the constant time implementability of clifford gates .    in order to study how the depth of flow and gflow are related to the constant time implementability of clifford gates",
    ", it would be helpful to construct a method to write a circuit decomposition with no ancillary qubits representing the same unitary transformation implemented by a measurement pattern with flow or gflow .",
    "since this compact circuit decomposition does not utilize extra work - space , it includes sequences of clifford gates that contribute to the increase of quantum depth of the circuit but not to the depth of flow and gflow .",
    "thus translations of a unitary represented by mbqc to that of a quantum circuit provide a clue for understanding the trade - off relation between the spacial and temporal resources .    to date",
    ", there are three methods to translate a measurement pattern into a compact quantum circuit proposed by @xcite . in @xcite , a translation method called the star pattern transformation ( spt ) applicable to measurement patterns on the graph states with flow",
    "is presented .",
    "if we ignore the depth for implementing clifford gates , the depth of the resulting circuit coincides with the depth of flow of the original measurement pattern .",
    "if we use the spt to convert a measurement pattern on a graph with gflow but without flow into a quantum circuit , the translation fails and we can not avoid obtaining an _ acausal _ circuit with ill - defined two qubit gates simultaneously acting in two different steps of time . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the authors investigated translation methods applicable also for graphs with gflow but no flow .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite based on category theory translates any measurement pattern with gflow into compact circuits and is applicable to a more general class of measurement patterns with no gflow .",
    "the depth of resulting circuits , however , is not analyzed and does not necessarily coincide with the depth of gflow even if the depth for implementing sequences of clifford gates are assumed to be constant on the circuit .    if acausal gates are allowed to be used in the quantum circuit model , its computational power can be greatly enhanced @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite suggest that the acausal circuits obtained by applying the spt for measurement patterns of mbqc may efficiently implement the unitary transformation represented by the original measurement pattern .",
    "we further expect that , from a viewpoint of the trade - off between spatial and temporal resources of computation , a measurement pattern with gflow reduces the quantum depth by deterministically simulating acausal gates by utilizing the extra work - space .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new method to translate a measurement pattern on a graph state with gflow into a compact quantum circuit by generalizing the spt .",
    "based on the new translation method , we clarify the relation between the depth of gflow and constant time implementability of clifford gates . we investigate the properties of graphs with gflow and the entanglement structure of the graph states defined by these graphs , and",
    "construct the translation method .",
    "we show the existence of path covers on graphs with gflow , which was previously shown only for graphs with flow @xcite .",
    "local unitary transformations on certain sets of qubits are used for simplifying the entanglement structure of the graph state .",
    "we also show a relation between the circuit decomposition obtained by our method and the acausal circuits obtained by directly applying the spt for measurement patterns on graph states with gflow but no flow .",
    "an operation represented by an acausal two - qubit gate simultaneously acting on two different time positions of the acausal circuit is defined to be consistent with a unitary transformation implemented by the measurement pattern .",
    "finally we discuss how mbqc compresses the quantum depth in connection with the acausal circuit representation .",

    "we have divided an open graph with gflow into layers , and transformed each layer into an open graph with flow followed by a sequence of cnot - gates . the unitary transformation implemented by the measurements on each layer",

    "a measurement pattern is translated via an acausal circuit including acausal gates obtained by directly applying the spt on a graph with gflow but no flow .",
    "we defined these acausal gates in terms of post - selection .",
    "based on this definition , all acausal gates can be canceled by taking appropriate transformations of the circuit .",
    "this leads to a well - defined ordinary circuit representation for the measurement pattern , which is equivalent to the one obtained by the first translation method .",
    "finally we have shown how the acausal circuits obtained by directly applying the spt on measurement patterns with gflow express the depth compression by introducing an extended definition of the temporal ordering of gates in their equivalent circuit representation with curved wires . for deterministically simulating the circuit with curved wires by using a gate - teleportation protocol , appropriate correction operators depending on the outcomes of the bell measurements",
    "are required .",
    "we conjecture that in order to lift the condition of post - selection entirely from the acausal circuits , it is sufficient to perform a single layer of pauli corrections per layer of @xmath90-gates according to the measurement outcomes for implementing the acausal @xmath51-gates acting astride the @xmath90-gates , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zigzag](c ) and in fig .  [ fig:6vers_correction ] .",
    "this is because any part of an acausal circuit corresponding to a single layer of gflow can be rewritten into a circuit constituting of a single layer of @xmath90-gates and a sequence of clifford gates , and it suffices to perform a single layer of pauli corrections for parallelizing all the clifford gates included in the sequence .",
    "if this conjecture is true , the quantum depth of the gate - teleportation protocol to implement a gate - sequence corresponding to the measurements on qubits in a single layer of gflow becomes constant .",
    "this implies that all acausal circuits obtained by directly applying the spt on measurement patterns with gflow can be simulated by the gate - teleportation protocol with the depth equal to the depth of gflow .",
    "our formulation presents a way to understand the trade - off relationship between the temporal and spatial resources in quantum computation in terms of the extended temporal ordering of the acausal circuits .",
    "the temporal resource , or quantum depth , of quantum computation represented by mbqc is reduced from the ordinary quantum circuit model by extending the definition of the temporal ordering of gates . the spatial resource , or an ancilla system , is required for simulating the extended temporal ordering by the gate - teleportation protocol .",
