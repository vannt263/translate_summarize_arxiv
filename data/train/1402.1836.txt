    "understanding the cosmological evolution of supermassive black hole ( smbhs ) is a key issue in modern astrophysics .",
    "the good correlation of the mass of a smbh in a galactic center with that of the bulge in the present - day universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that smbhs and galaxies co - evolved in the past .",
    "this idea is also supported by the similarity of the global history between star formation and smbh growth @xcite .",
    "the so - called down - sizing or anti - hierarchical evolution , the trend that more massive systems formed in earlier cosmic time , has been revealed for both smbhs ( @xcite , u03 ; @xcite , h05 ) and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are the phenomena where smbhs gain their masses from accreting gas by converting a part of their gravitational energies into radiation .",
    "it is known that the majority of agns are obscured by gas and dust surrounding the smbhs , being classified as `` type-2 '' agns .",
    "to elucidate the growth history of smbhs , a complete survey of agns including heavily obscured populations throughout the history of the universe is necessary .",
    "x - ray observations , in particular those at high energies above a few kev , provide one of the most powerful approach for agn detection thanks to the strong penetrating power against absorption and little contamination from star lights in the host galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the deepest x - ray surveys currently available achieve the highest sensitivity even for unobscured ( `` type-1 '' ) agns among those at any wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the surface number density of the faintest x - ray agns reaches @xmath3 deg@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the integration of emission from all accreting smbhs in the universe is observed as the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "to quantitatively solve the xrb origin is equivalent to revealing the cosmological evolution of agns that constitute the xrb .",
    "the xrb spans over a wide energy range from @xmath50.1 kev to @xmath5100 kev and then is smoothly connected to the gamma - ray background at higher energies .",
    "its spectrum has a peak energy density around @xmath520 kev . at energies below @xmath58 kev ,",
    "now almost all of the xrb is resolved into discrete sources , mainly agns .",
    "enormous efforts have been made to identify agns detected in x - ray surveys on the basis of multiwavelength observations , and the redshifts ( and hence luminosities ) of a large fraction of these sources are now estimated .",
    "these results make it possible to determine the spatial number density of agns that constitute the xrb below @xmath58 kev and its evolution . by contrast , in the hard x - ray band above @xmath510 kev , a significant fraction of the xrb is still left unresolved .",
    "therefore , at present , the whole origin of the xrb over the wide range can not be directly revealed by resolving individual sources .",
    "it is very important to construct a `` population synthesis model '' of the xrb where the evolutions of all x - ray emitting agns with various types are formulated ( for previous works , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model , in principle , must explain all the observational constraints including source number counts , redshift and luminosity distribution , the shape of the xrb .",
    "once established , it gives the basis to understand the accretion history of the universe traced by x - rays , which is subject to least biases .",
    "two major elements in the population synthesis models are the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) and absorption function ( or @xmath6  function , @xcite ) of agns .",
    "the xlf represents the number density of agn per comoving space as a function of luminosity and redshift , one of the most important statistical quantity that can be determined from unbiased surveys .",
    "previously many studies have been made on the cosmological evolutions of the xlf of agns in the soft band below 2 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by using hard x - ray selected samples that contain both type-1 ( unabsorbed ) and type-2 ( absorbed ) agns , the absorption functions have been also investigated @xcite .",
    "besides the well established anti - correlation of absorption fraction with luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several works have reported that the fraction of absorbed agns increased toward higher redshift from @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "more recent studies of high redshift agns at @xmath9 in deep fields ( @xcite ; @xcite ) reveal larger absorption fractions of high luminosity agns compared with the local universe .",
    "this redshift evolution is not included in the population synthesis model by @xcite , one of the most widely referred model available at present .",
    "there still remain uncertainties on the evolution of agns , however .",
    "the first issue is the shape of the xlf and its cosmological evolution . on the basis of hard x - ray surveys , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "find that the xlf of agn is best described with the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model .",
    "later , @xcite propose that the luminosity and density evolution ( lade ) where the shape of the xlf is constant over the whole redshift range unlike the case of ldde also gives a similarly good fit to their data . while the down - sizing behavior is commonly seen in both models , quite different number of agns",
    "are predicted particularly at high redshifts of @xmath10 .",
    "the second one is the number density ( or fraction ) of heavily obscured agns with @xmath6  @xmath11 cm@xmath4 , so - called `` compton - thick '' agns ( ctk agns ) .",
    "even hard x - ray surveys above 10 kev are subject to bias against detecting heavily ctk agns , because the transmitted emission is significantly suppressed due to repeated compton scattering ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is not easy to identify individual ctk agns with limited photon statistics in deep survey data , and to estimate their intrinsic number density by correcting for such biases .    in this work",
    ", we present our latest results of agn xlf over the redshift range from 0 to 5 , by utilizing one of the largest combined sample ever available , obtained from surveys of various depth , width , and energy bands performed with _",
    "swift_/bat , the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( _ maxi _ , @xcite ) , _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ , and _",
    "rosat_. the sample consists of 4039 detections in the soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and/or hard ( @xmath0 kev ) bands .",
    "we utilize a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method to reproduce the count - rate versus redshift distribution for each survey , by taking into account the selection biases . in the analysis ,",
    "the contribution of ctk agns is considered , which is found to be more important in harder bands and at fainter fluxes .",
    "this enables us to determine the intrinsic xlf and the absorption function of type-1 plus type-2 agns with an unprecedented accuracy , thus establishing a standard population synthesis model of the xrb that is consistent with most of observational constraints currently available .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - sample ] explains the sample used in our analysis . in section  [ sec - abs ] the absorption properties of agns are discussed and the absorption function is formulated .",
    "section  [ sec - template ] introduces the `` template model '' of broad band x - ray spectra of agns adopted in this work .",
    "the distribution of photon index is examined by using the _ swift_/bat sample in section  [ sec - idx ] .",
    "section  [ sec - lf ] describes the details of main analysis using the whole sample .",
    "the best - fit results of the xlf are presented there .",
    "the predictions from the population synthesis model are given in section  [ sec - model ] .",
    "we also discuss the constraints on the ctk agn fraction and degeneracy with other parameters .",
    "section  [ sec - blf ] represents an determination of the bolometric luminosity function of agns based on our new xlf , and the growth history of smbhs .",
    "the conclusions of our work are summarized in section  [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "the cosmological parameters of ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 )  = ( 70@xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) are adopted throughout the paper .",
    "the `` log '' symbol represents the base-10 logarithm , while `` ln '' the natural logarithm .",
    "in order to investigate the xlf and absorption function of agns covering a wide range of luminosity and redshift , it is vital to construct a sample combined from various surveys with different flux limits and area .",
    "also , high degrees of identification completeness in terms of spectroscopic and/or photometric redshift determination are required to minimize systematic uncertainties caused by sample incompleteness",
    ". basically , x - ray surveys at higher energies are more suitable to detect obscured agns with less biases .",
    "nevertheless , those in the soft band ( @xmath20.52 kev ) are also quite useful as long as such biases are properly corrected .",
    "generally , fainter flux limits are achieved in softer energy band thanks to the larger collecting area of x - ray telescopes . in particular , for high redshift agns , the reduction of observed fluxes due to photo - electric absorptions becomes less important thanks to the k - correction effect .",
    "indeed , the soft x - ray surveys are often utilized to search for high redshift agns even including type-2 objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", it is known that the photon flux of an absorbed agn re - increase towards the lowest energy , because the absorber does not fully cover the nucleus , or because the absorber is ionized , or because other soft components of different origins are present . according to the systematic spectral study of local agns detected in the swift / bat survey @xcite , in most cases the x - ray spectra of absorbed agns",
    "can be well represented by the partial covering model , where a fraction of @xmath143 of the total continuum is subject to absorption .",
    "a majority of absorbed agns have covering fractions of @xmath144 , which can be explained by the leakage of the scattered component from outside the torus ( see section  [ sec - template ] ) , while @xmath515% of the total agns show smaller covering fractions , with a medium of @xmath1450.95 , most probably due to the complex nature of the absorber or the presence of other components . to evaluate the possible systematic errors , we statistically take into account the distribution of these complex spectra in calculating the `` @xmath6  response matrix function '' and repeat the analysis .",

    "the model parameters are the photon index @xmath127 , the column density @xmath152 , the opening angle @xmath153 ( or @xmath154 ) , and the inclination angle @xmath155 ( see figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum consists of the transmitted emission ( unabsorbed when @xmath156 and vice versa ) , its reflected spectra from the torus including fluorescence lines from abundant metals ( such as iron , nickel , etc ) .",
    "self - absorption of the reprocessed emission by the torus itself is properly taken into account for a given geometry .    throughout our work",
    ", we assume the `` luminosity and redshift dependent unified scheme '' of agns ; the absorbed fraction of agns is simply determined by the covering factor of the torus whose geometry depends on both @xmath79  and @xmath86 .",
    "the torus opening angle can be then related to the fraction of total absorbed agns ( including ctk ones ) among all agns , @xmath157 , as @xmath158 we recall that the absorbed agns are defined as those with log @xmath6  @xmath159 .",
    "this is based on the idea that absorptions smaller than log @xmath6  = 22 are not originated from the torus , but most probably from interstellar medium in the host galaxy ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . hence , we multiply the absorption to all the spectral components for type-1 agns ( i.e. , with log @xmath6  @xmath160 ) , while we ignore other origins than the tori for the absorptions in type-2 agns . in this formulation , we assume that ctk agns are just an extension of ctn ones with the same @xmath79  and @xmath86 toward larger column densities . using a type-1 agn sample in the local universe , @xcite find that the luminosity - dependent unified scheme can explain the so - called x - ray baldwin effect @xcite , the anti - correlation between the equivalent width of iron - k line and x - ray luminosity , although the definition of the absorbed fraction is slightly different from ours ; when they refer to the result by @xcite , agns with log @xmath6@xmath90 21.5 are counted as absorbed ones by neglecting ctk agns .",

    "here we exclude the results for four objects out of 79 ctn agns in the original sample for which the goodness of the fit is found to be poor .",

    "* ) that the average slope of type-1 agns is larger than that of type-2 agns , even after properly taking into account the reflection components in the spectra .",

    "the effects by changing the @xmath179 or @xmath171 parameters onto our final results will be examined in section  [ sec - model - dependence ] .",
    "in this section we describe the main part of analysis where the xlf is determined by performing an ml fit to our sample at @xmath75 .",
    "we define the xlf of ctn agns so that @xmath180 represents the number density per unit co - moving volume per log @xmath79as a function of @xmath79  and @xmath86 in units of mpc @xmath181 dex@xmath17 .",
    "the ml fit to unbinned data is a standard method to determine the model parameters when the sample size is limited .",
    "unlike in many previous works , however , we do not use the list of @xmath79  and @xmath86 as the input data .",
    "this is because , as already mentioned in section  [ sec - sample - luminosity ] , we can not avoid uncertainties in the determination of @xmath79  for which an accurate measurement of absorption is required , while spectral information is limited due to poor statistics in faint sources .",
    "in particular when we expand the @xmath6region of interest above log @xmath6  @xmath182 to include ctk agns , the hardness ratio does not uniquely correspond to a single @xmath6  value because of the complexity of the spectrum , producing additional systematic errors to determine @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we develop a new analysis method to utilize the list of the count rate @xmath183  and @xmath86 obtained in each survey , the most basic observational quantities without any corrections .",
    "this approach is based on a `` forward method '' , where comparison between the prediction and observation is made at the final stage .",
    "namely , we search for a set of parameters of the xlf and absorption function that best reproduce the count - rate versus @xmath86 distributions of all surveys used in the analysis .",
    "the merit is that we can properly take into account any complex x - ray spectra in the analysis including ctk agns .",
    "another merit is that we can treat surveys of the same field ( including all sky surveys ) in different energy bands as independent data of one another , enabling us to utilize all samples without worrying about the overlap of objects detected in multiple surveys .",
    "specifically , we define a likelihood estimator as @xmath184 where @xmath185 in the integrand of the numerator . the suffixes @xmath124 and @xmath125 represent each independent detection and survey , respectively .",
    "here @xmath85 is the luminosity distance , @xmath186 is the conversion factor from the count rate in the @xmath125-th survey into the de - absorbed flux in the observer s frame @xmath187 kev band , and @xmath188 is the observed count rate of the @xmath124-th detection .",
    "the term @xmath189 represents the expected number from the @xmath125-th survey calculated as @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the angular distance , @xmath192 the differential look back time , and @xmath193 is the area of the @xmath125-th survey expected from an agn with @xmath6 , @xmath127 , @xmath79 , and @xmath86 .    in principle , it is possible to simultaneously constrain the xlf , absorption function @xmath194 , and photon index function @xmath195 through an ml fit . in practice , however , to avoid strong parameter coupling we only make the index of the evolution factor @xmath140 in the absorption function ( equation  [ eq - a1 ] ) as a free parameter , besides those in the xlf . in our baseline model ,",
    "the other parameters of the absorption function and photon index function are all fixed at the values presented in sections  [ sec - abs ] and [ sec - idx ] , respectively . since this ml fit does not constrain the normalization of the xlf , we determine it so that the expected number of the total detections agrees with the observed one , @xmath196 , and basically estimate the uncertainty from its poisson error ( but see below ) . in ml",
    "fits , the minimized value of the likelihood estimator itself can not be utilized to evaluate the absolute goodness of the fit .",
    "thus , we verify it by comparing the flux and redshift distribution between the model prediction and observation on the basis of @xmath197 test .    in a normal ml fit",
    "performed to a completely independent dataset ( like the analysis presented in section  [ sec - abs - local ] ) , the 1@xmath31 error for a single parameter is defined as the deviation from the best - fit when the @xmath198-value is increased by @xmath199 from its minimum value . in our case , however , we utilize multiple - band data from the same objects ( i.e. , at common redshifts ) for a significant fraction of the sample , which would work to underestimate the true errors in the xlf parameters .",
    "hence , here we conservatively estimate their 1@xmath31 errors by adopting @xmath200 instead of @xmath199 , to take into account the `` double counting '' effects . for the same reason",
    ", we estimate the relative uncertainty in the normalization of the xlf as @xmath201 instead of @xmath202 .    in our analysis , we neglect the effects of agn variability in determination of the xlf .",
    "many x - ray surveys utilized in our study are , however , based on observations with a typical exposure of @xmath5 a day , except for the _ swift_/bat and _ maxi _  surveys and very deep ones like the cdfn and cdfs .",
    "this means that we measure an instantaneous flux ( or luminosity ) of an agn , which may well be different from its `` true '' flux averaged over a much longer period .",
    "for instance , @xcite report that most of agns in the cdfs posses intrinsic x - ray variability on timescales ranging from a day to a year .",
    "they find that the fractional variability is @xmath203 for 90% of the agn .",
    "to check the possible systematic effects , we thus perform an ml fit with the same xlf model as described in section  [ sec - lf - results ] by taking into account variability of each agn in equation  ( [ eq - ml2 ] ) except for the _ swift_/bat , _ maxi _ , cdfn , and cdfs samples . here",
    "the distribution of the observed flux relative to the intrinsic one is assumed to be a gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.2 , which is adopted as the maximum value regardless of the luminosity .",
    "the result verifies that the best - fit xlf parameters are not affected by the time variability over the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we model the luminosity function in the local universe by a smoothly - connected double power law model that has slopes @xmath204 and @xmath205 below and above the break luminosity @xmath206 , respectively : @xmath207^{-1}.\\ ] ] many previous works based on a sample covering a sufficiently wide @xmath79and @xmath86 range have revealed that the evolution of the xlf is more complex than that approximated by a simple model like the pure density evolution ( pde ) or the pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) . here",
    "we adopt the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) , which is found to be give a good representation of the xlf of agn in a number of studies based on hard x - ray ( @xmath342 kev ) selected samples @xcite and on soft x - ray ( @xmath892 kev ) selected samples @xcite .",
    "we basically follow the formulation of the xlf in u03 with a few additional modifications .",
    "the xlf at a given @xmath86 is calculated by multiplying a luminosity - dependent evolution factor @xmath208 to the local one : @xmath209 recent studies based on large area surveys like cosmos and sxds with high completeness have established a decay of the comoving number density of luminous agns with @xmath79  @xmath210 toward higher redshift above @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "the similar trend was suggested by a previous work by @xcite using a _",
    "chandra_serendipitous survey called champ , where the completeness correction was made in the x - ray and optical flux plane .",
    "hence , we take into account the decline in the evolution factor by introducing another ( luminosity - dependent ) cutoff redshift above which the decline of @xmath212 with @xmath86 starts to appear .",
    "the evolution factor as a function of @xmath86 and @xmath79  is thus represented as @xmath213 \\\\       ( 1 + z_{c1})^{p1 }        \\left(\\frac { 1 + z } { 1 + z_{c1}}\\right)^{p2 } & [ z_{c1}(l_{\\rm x } ) < z \\le z_{c2 } ] \\\\       ( 1 + z_{c1})^{p1 } \\left(\\frac { 1 + z_{c2 } } { 1 + z_{c1}}\\right)^{p2 } \\left(\\frac { 1 + z } { 1 + z_{c2}}\\right)^{p3 } & [ z > z_{c2 } ] \\\\    \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath214 and @xmath214 represent two cutoff redshifts where the evolution index changes from @xmath215 to @xmath216 and from @xmath216 to @xmath217 , respectively .",

    "the discrepancy could be explained by incompleteness .",
    "the same problem could be present in our sample , too .",
    "however , assuming the extreme case that all the unidentified agns detected in the soft band are @xmath71 agns , we find that the xlf normalization at @xmath71 becomes only 1.5 times larger than the present data points in average , which is still consistent with the best fit model within the errors .    figure  [ fig - zf ] plot the co - moving space number density of ctn agns as a function of redshift integrated in different luminosity bins , log @xmath79  = 4243 , 4344 , 4445 , and 4547 .",
    "the curves show that of the best - fit model , while the data points are based on the `` @xmath239 method '' as explained above . in this figure , to ensure complete independence of the plotted data , we utilize either the hard - band or soft - band selected sample to calculate the data points in each redshift and luminosity bin . specifically , we adopt the hard - band samples ( without the _ maxi _  one ) in the region of @xmath245 and log @xmath79  @xmath246 , and the soft - band samples for the rest .",
    "this is because at higher redshifts soft - band surveys become more efficient even for obscured agns thanks to the k - correction effect .",
    "also , at large @xmath79  ranges the majority of agns are unobscured populations ( section  [ sec - abs ] ) , for which wide area surveys with _ rosat_provide a large number of sources .    from figure  [ fig - zf ] , one can clearly confirm the global `` down - sizing '' evolution , where more luminous agns have their number density peak at higher redshifts compared with less luminous ones .",
    "we note , however , that when we only focus attention on the high redshift range of @xmath211 , our ldde model with @xmath230 indicates an `` up - sizing '' evolution instead ( i.e. , the number ratio of less luminous agns to more luminous ones is larger at earlier epochs ) .",
    "this is what is expected from the hierarchical structure formation in the early universe .",
    "thus , the smbh growth must be correctly described by _",
    "`` up - down sizing''_. to firmly establish this behavior , it is critical to determine the space number density of all agns at @xmath211 in both the lowest and highest luminosity ranges with better accuracies .",
    "as noticed in figures  [ fig - lf ] and [ fig - lf - nodata ] , the shape of the xlf at @xmath142 is quite different from that in the local universe in the sense that the slope at the low luminosity range is significantly flatter than those observed at lower redshifts .",
    "this trend can be well reproduced by the ldde model . here",
    "we check if the lade model of the xlf proposed by @xcite also gives a good description of our data .",
    "unlike the ldde , the lade assumes a constant relative shape of the xlf in the logarithmic scales over the full redshift range , and its break luminosity and normalization is given as a function of redshift .",
    "we perform an ml fit to the whole sample by adopting the same formulation of the xlf as given in @xcite . a chi - squared test for the 2-dimensional histograms of flux and redshift between the best - fit model and data yields @xmath247 ( d.o.f=114 ) .",
    "the lade model is thus rejected with a @xmath248 value of @xmath249 .",
    "we infer that it is difficult to distinguish the ldde and lade models in @xcite because of the smaller number of sample used there ; indeed @xcite show that the ldde gives a better fit to their data than the lade , although the difference is not significant .      the parameters of the agn xlf are better constrained than in any of previous works thanks to our large sample size ( @xmath215 and @xmath24 times larger than those used by u03 and h05 , respectively ) . here",
    "we compare them with those of the ldde model by u03 and by h05 as representative ones .",
    "although the direct comparison with u03 is not trivial as the formulation of the xlf in u03 is simpler than ours ( e.g. , @xmath250 is assumed in u03 ) , the overall parameters are in good agreement between our work and u03 except for @xmath205 .",
    "the overall shape of our xlf derived for all ctn agns is almost consistent with that by h05 derived only for type-1 agns ( see their table  5 ) within the errors except for @xmath251 ( = @xmath222 in our paper ) , which is found to be slightly larger ( @xmath252 ) than in h05 ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath254 parameter defined in h05 can be converted to @xmath255 with @xmath256 ( = @xmath222 in our paper ) , and thus agrees with our result ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "our best - fit model has steeper slopes in the double power - law form for the local xlf , @xmath258 and @xmath259 , than those obtained by h05 .",

    "more recently , @xcite constrain the radiation efficiency as a function of both @xmath86 and @xmath331 ; they find that @xmath371 is roughly proportional to @xmath372 at @xmath373 , confirming the trend reported by @xcite , while the mass dependence becomes weaker or even inverted at lower redshifts .    accordingly , we empirically model @xmath330 as a power law function of black hole mass @xmath374 although here we ignore the redshift dependence for simplicity .",
    "we adopt log @xmath375 and @xmath363 @xcite , as done in @xcite .",
    "then , performing a @xmath197 fit to the observed smbh mfs at @xmath7 and @xmath282 by @xcite , we obtain @xmath376 and @xmath377 with @xmath197/d.o.f .",
    "= 10.3/14 .",
    "figure  [ fig - bhmfmf ] ( right ) plots the predicted agn relic mfs at several redshifts , which are in very good agreements with the observed ones ( data points ) .",
    "if the mass dependence of @xmath330 is ignored ( i.e. , @xmath378 ) , the agn relic mfs significantly under(over)-estimates the observed mfs at mass ranges lower ( higher ) than log @xmath379 at both @xmath282 and @xmath7 ; we plot this case by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig - bhmfmf ] ( right ) .",
    "the large discrepancy at @xmath7 is attributable to that already present at @xmath282 , suggesting that the assumption of constant @xmath371 is not proper at @xmath373 , unlike the case of @xmath380 discussed earlier .",
    "recently , @xcite have updated the calibration between smbh mass and the luminosity , mass , or velocity dispersion of the bulge component of the host galaxy in the local universe .",
    "this leads to an upward revision by a factor of @xmath524 of smbh masses that have been previously used . to examine the influences by this revision",
    ", we update the smbh mfs of @xcite , by assuming the new smbh - mass vs bulge - mass relation given as equation ( 10 ) of @xcite , instead of that of @xcite adopted by @xcite .",
    "the revision of the smbh masses also affects the deviation of the eddington - ratio distribution of agns .",
    "we find that the eddington ratios in @xcite should be decreased by a factor of @xmath23 when we refer to equation ( 3 ) of @xcite , yielding an updated mean value of log @xmath381 .",
    "we then repeat the same analysis as above by fitting agn relic mfs to these revised smbh mfs .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig - bhmfmf2 ] .",
    "when a constant radiation efficiency is assumed , we obtain @xmath382 and log @xmath383 with @xmath384 ( figure  [ fig - bhmfmf2 ] left ) .",
    "this eddington ratio is significantly larger than the observed value ( log @xmath385 ) .",
    "when we fix @xmath386 and @xmath363 , the agn relic mfs can not reproduce the observed mfs with @xmath387 . introducing a power - law like mass dependence of the radiation efficiency again",
    "significantly improves the fit , giving @xmath388 and @xmath389 with @xmath197/d.o.f .",
    "= 13.7/14 ( figure  [ fig - bhmfmf2 ] right ) .",
    "thus , these arguments based on the new agn blf and updated smbh mfs are consistent with those by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that the radiation efficiency should increase with black hole mass , at least at @xmath373 .",
    "the possible contribution of mergers neglected here only works to increase the predicted mf at the high mass region , and hence does not essentially change this conclusion ( see the discussion of @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , we find that the inferred radiation efficiency could be significantly reduced compared with the previous estimates by the revision of the smbh mfs .",
    "our results imply that , in relatively low mass ( hence low luminosity ) agns with log @xmath390 , where @xmath391 on average , the standard accretion disk would be truncated before reaching the radius corresponding to the innermost stable circular orbit of a non - rotating black hole and is replaced by a riaf .",
    "the inferred high radiation efficiencies of higher mass agns suggest that their smbhs are rotating , implying that they grew predominantly by accretion .",
    "we note , however , that the exact results depend on the assumption of the eddington ratio distribution function that is constant against luminosity and redshift in the above analysis .",
    "recent work using the x - ray selected agns at @xmath392 in the sxds field by @xcite suggests that the mean eddington ratio is smaller at lower luminosities .",
    "furthermore , no consensus has been established on its possible redshift evolution . to obtain robust conclusions ,",
    "it is important to determine the eddington ratio distribution function and the mf of agns over a wide range of luminosity and redshift based on accurate determination of their black hole masses .",

    "this gives us the best opportunity to trace the cosmological evolution of absorption properties and x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of all agns with log @xmath79  ( 210 kev ) = 4246 , including both type-1 ( unabsorbed ) and type-2 ( absorbed ) ones , from @xmath7 to @xmath364 .",

    "the distribution of photon index is peaked at @xmath167 for type-1 agns and @xmath169 for type-2 agns .",

    "we have developed a novel analysis method where we perform a maximum likelihood fit directly to the list of the observed count rate and redshift by taking into account selection biases in each survey .",
    "here we consider the evolution of the absorbed fraction , the contribution of compton - thick ( ctk ) agns with log @xmath62426 , and agn broad band x - ray spectra including reflection components from tori based on the luminosity and redshift dependent unified scheme .",
    "we find that the shape of the xlf at @xmath1 is significantly different from that in the local universe , showing flatter slopes in the lower luminosity range below the break .",
    "its cosmological evolution is well described with the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model , while the luminosity and density evolution ( lade ) model fails to fit the data .",
    "\\6 . on the basis of the absorption function and xlf determined above ,",
    "we have newly constructed a population synthesis model of the x - ray background ( xrb ) , which can be regarded as a `` standard model '' that well reproduces the source counts in both soft and hard bands , the observed fractions of compton - thick agns , and the spectrum of the hard xrb .",
    "\\7 . to reproduce the hard xrb intensity in the 2050 kev band within current uncertainties , we constrain that the fraction of ctk agns with log @xmath6  = 2426 to absorbed ctn agns with log @xmath6  = 2224 should be 0.51.6 .",
    "this is also well consistent with the results of hard x - ray surveys above @xmath395 kev currently available .",
