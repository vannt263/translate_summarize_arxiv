    "while cumulants of conserved charges exhibit singular behavior at the critical point @xcite , they are also sensitive probes for pseudo - critical behavior in the vicinity of the chiral crossover transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fluctuations of conserved charges carry information on freeze - out conditions in heavy ion collisions @xcite and they can be influenced by different final state effects @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the chemical freeze - out , determined by a fit of statistical hadronization models to data for particle yields in heavy ion collisions @xcite , and the crossover transition determined in lattice qcd , suggests that one may gain access to critical phenomena at the qcd phase boundary by measuring fluctuations of conserved charges at the lhc and in the bes at rhic @xcite .    in order to identify critical properties of different fluctuations",
    ", one needs to understand a non - critical baseline for their probability distribution and resulting cumulants .",
    "note that the often used `` poisson baseline '' , i.e. the skellam distribution , is not an adequate reference for the analysis of net - electric charge and net - strangeness fluctuations , due to contributions from multi - charged states and quantum statistics effects .",
    "this is not the case for net - baryon number fluctuations where due to the absence of multi - charged baryons and the large nucleon mass a skellam distribution is indeed an appropriate reference @xcite .",
    "net - electric charge fluctuations are dominated by pions .",
    "they are therefore strongly influenced by quantum statistics effects .",
    "furthermore , experimental acceptance cuts can severely influence electric charge fluctuations .",
    "since the skellam distribution describes the distribution for the difference of two independent quantities obeying poisson statistics , limiting the momentum acceptance does not change the nature of the distribution .",
    "thus , fluctuations of net baryon number should be rather weakly influenced by kinematic cuts @xcite .",
    "however , due to contributions from multi - charged states and quantum statistic effects , this is not the case for electric charge fluctuations .    in this study , we discuss the effects of different kinematic cuts on the net - electric charge fluctuations in a static and expanding medium .",
    "we consider the effect of a transverse momentum cut - off and of a limited pseudo - rapidity acceptance on different ratios of the @xmath9th order cummulants @xmath0 of net - electric charge fluctuations .",
    "similar studies , have been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite within a hadron resonance gas model .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the theoretical interpretation of these results , based on a very transparent example of an ideal gas of charged pions with quantum statistics , which can be viewed as a multi - component gas of particles with different charges , masses and degeneracies .",
    "such a system contains all relevant properties of charge fluctuations that allow for a transparent implementation and interpretation of different kinematic cuts and their consequences .",
    "in particular , we show that the substantial modification of the higher order cumulant ratios with momentum cuts , in the acceptance windows of star collaboration , that have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite may be viewed as arising from the suppression of multi - charged states , reflecting the bose momentum distribution in a pion gas .",
    "we will extend this discussion to different low and high transverse momentum cuts , as well as pseudo - rapidity windows .",
    "we will also focus on properties of the @xmath10 ratio which is an important baseline to identify cut - off effects on observable which is non - critical with respect to the @xmath11 universality class .",
    "we perform a quantitative comparison of our analysis with data obtained by the phenix and star collaborations .",
    "however , in this case we also include the contribution of other hadronic states using a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model .",
    "we will show , that the increase of the lower momentum cut from @xmath3 gev ( star ) to @xmath4  gev ( phenix ) does account for a large fraction of the differences present in the data for mean over variance , @xmath12 .",
    "similar differences are expected to show up in data for the normalized kurtosis , @xmath6 .",
    "finally we will discuss the relation between non - zero momentum cut - off and finite volume effects in a non - interacting pion gas .",
    "this allows to argue that lattice qcd calculations of electric charge fluctuations performed in a finite volume are actually adequate to describe charge fluctuations determined experimentally and infinite volume extrapolation may even not be needed due to the similarity between finite volume and non - zero transverse momentum cut - off effects .",

    "this temperature dependence can be deduced from the @xmath54 function by changing the integration variable from @xmath2 to @xmath61 , which shifts the lower limit of the integration range to @xmath62 .",

    "the difference in the cut - off dependence of @xmath50 and @xmath38 will also influence their ratio , @xmath63 .",

    "cuts in pseudo - rapidity , on the other hand , do not restrict the minimal momentum in the particle dispersion relation and therefore do not lead to an additional suppression of multi - charged clusters contributing to @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown in the previous section , that a cut - off imposed on the low momentum part of the particle phase - space can have significant effects on different cumulants of net electric charge fluctuations and their ratios .",
    "thus , the difference of @xmath76  mev in the transverse momentum cut - off used by the phenix and star collaborations @xcite , should naturally imply differences in their results on cumulants of electric charge fluctuations .",
    "however , in order to quantify the influence of momentum cut - off effects on charge fluctuations in the context of heavy ion data , one needs to extend the pion gas calculation by including contributions from all known charged hadrons and resonances . in the following",

    "in fact , in the case relevant for heavy ion collisions , i.e. in a strangeness neutral system , @xmath78 , with a fixed ratio of net - electric charge and net - baryon number , @xmath79 , the electric charge chemical potential required to fulfill these constraints is negative .",
    "the contribution of charged , non - strange mesons to @xmath80 thus is negative and the mean becomes positive only due to contributions from charged baryons and strange mesons .",

    "using eq .",
    ", which relates @xmath142 to a box size @xmath134 , we find that these cut - offs correspond to aspect ratios , @xmath143 .",
    "thus , lattice calculations performed with an aspect ratio @xmath144 seem to be appropriate to characterize the thermodynamics probed with transverse momentum cut - offs similar to those used by the star collaboration .",
    "we have discussed the influence of kinematic cuts in transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity on electric charge fluctuations in a static and expanding medium .",
    "our basic arguments were given by considering a very transparent example of an ideal gas of charged pions with quantum statistics .",
    "such a system can be viewed as a multi - component gas of boltzmann particles with different charges , masses , and degeneracy factors , thus it contains all relevant properties to study charge fluctuations , with a transparent implementation of different kinematic cuts .",
    "we demonstrate , that a non - vanishing lower @xmath2 cut in the net - electric charge fluctuations , can substantially reduce the second and fourth order cumulants of net electric charge fluctuations , as well as , their ratio quantified by the normalized kurtosis @xmath6 .",
    "these conclusions are valid in a static and expanding medium .",
    "the effect of pseudo - rapidity cuts was shown to be rather negligible .",
    "consequently , the observed differences between star and phenix data on cumulants of electric charge fluctuations could be traced back to their different @xmath2 acceptance .    the experimental data on the ratio of mean and variance , @xmath12 , and normalized kurtosis @xmath6 , were analyzed in a hadron resonance gas .",
    "it was shown , that in heavy ion collisions , the influence of a non - zero transverse momentum cut - off , @xmath7 , on @xmath12 is almost independent of the collision energy , and that it increases , with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the larger @xmath7 used by phenix , suggests that their @xmath12 should be larger than the corresponding star values .",
    "we have shown , that indeed , by rescaling the star and phenix data to vanishing transverse momentum , makes these data compatible within the still large systematic errors of the phenix data .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that the reduction of @xmath6 due to the shift of @xmath7 will lead to differences between phenix and star data of @xmath8 , which currently are buried under large statistical and systematic errors .",
    "having in mind a possible comparison between experimental data on fluctuations of conserved charges and lattice qcd results , we have discussed the relation between momentum cut - off and finite volume effects .",
    "we have shown , in the context of an ideal pion gas , that cumulants of electric charge fluctuations in a finite box of size @xmath125 , can be reproduced by a calculation of charge fluctuations in an infinite box , but with a transverse momentum cut - off @xmath133 , where @xmath41 is a constant .    finally , considering typical box sizes used in lattice qcd calculations , and the lower transverse momentum cut - off scale in the experimental data on electric charge fluctuations , we have argued , that their direct comparison at a chiral crossover temperature , might be justified .",
