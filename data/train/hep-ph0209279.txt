    "the minimal standard model(msm ) @xcite @xcite has been proved by all precise experimental data that the msm is a very successful model of particle physics . but until now the symmetric breaking structure of the electroweak interactions has not yet been directly explored experimentally .",
    "so the exploration of the sm higgs boson is a major goal of the present and future colliders .",
    "as we know , any enlargement of the higgs sector beyond the single @xmath4 higgs doublet of the msm necessarily introduces other neutral higgs bosons and charged higgs bosons . like",
    "the general two - higgs - doublet model(2hdm ) , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite @xcite requires the introduction of two higgs doublets in order to preserve supersymmetry .",
    "these two higgs doublets predict some more elementary higgs bosons : one cp - even neutral higgs boson(@xmath5 ) , one cp - odd neutral higgs boson(@xmath6 ) and two charged higgs bosons(@xmath7 ) , which are absent in the msm .",
    "any experimental discovery of these non - sm - like higgs bosons will be the direct verification of these extended versions of the higgs sector .",
    "therefore , the study of various production mechanisms of the non - sm - like higgs bosons at the present and future colliders is well motivated .",
    "searching for the non - sm - like higgs bosons and studying their properties at the future multi - tev hadron colliders , such as the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , are possible as expected by supersymmetric ( susy ) theory @xcite @xcite . the gluon fusion mechanism @xmath8 provides the dominant production mechanism of neutral higgs bosons at the lhc in the entire relevant mass range up to about 1 tev for the small and moderate values of @xmath3 in the mssm @xcite .",
    "the heavy neutral higgs boson can be also produced in pair ( @xmath9 ) at the lhc , if it is kinematically allowed @xcite .",
    "studying the process of a heavy charged higgs boson associated with @xmath10 boson is another attractive way in searching for the @xmath7 bosons , because the @xmath11-boson s leptonic decay may be used as a spectacular trigger .",
    "the calculations of the heavy @xmath7 production associated with @xmath12 boson at a future electron - positron collider can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the complete calculations of the @xmath13 associated production at hadron colliders both in the 2hdm and the mssm are given in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "analogously , @xmath14 associated production would also be an efficient way in searching for the heavy neutral cp - odd higgs boson @xmath6 .",
    "although the @xmath6 boson can be produced in pair at future colliders @xcite @xcite , the @xmath14 associated production will be the kinematically favored mechanism to produce @xmath6 higgs boson for the heavy @xmath6 higgs boson . and",
    "again the leptonic decay of @xmath15 maybe benefit for triggering the @xmath16 associated production events .",

    "in our calculation we use the thooft - feynman gauge and adopt the dimension regularization scheme in the general 2hdm and the dimensional reduction ( dr ) scheme @xcite in the mssm . in the loop diagram calculation we adopted the definitions of one - loop integral functions in reference @xcite .",

    "the numerical calculation of the loop integrals are implemented by using mathematica programs .",
    "we denote the @xmath17 associated production via drell - yan subprocess as @xmath25    due to the feature of the yukawa coupling that the coupling strength between quarks and higgs boson is in proportion to the correspondent quark mass , the cross sections of subprocesses @xmath26 should be much smaller than those of the subprocesses @xmath27 . considering the fact that the luminosity of top ( anti - top ) quark is much lower than that of bottom ( anti - bottom ) quark from a proton",
