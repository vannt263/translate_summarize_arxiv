    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic explosions in the universe , and the isotropic luminosity reaches @xmath7 for the brightest bursts . since the discovery of x - ray afterglow of grbs by bepposax @xcite and the identification of optical counterparts at cosmological distance , many observational facts and theoretical works have led us to understand the nature of grbs .",
    "however , a crucial issue still remaining to answer is how to release such a huge energy as @xmath0-ray photons . in spite of extensive discussions with the spectral and lightcurve information being collected ,",
    "there are still several possible models of grbs @xcite .",
    "the polarimetric observations provide us completely different information .",
    "a firm detection of linear polarization of @xmath0-ray photons will further constrain the emission models @xcite .    the polarization measurement of grbs",
    "has been performed in the late optical afterglows at first @xcite .",
    "all of these results show that the polarization degree ( @xmath2 ) of a few  % level .",
    "@xcite set upper limit of @xmath8  % for the early optical afterglow .",
    "detailed observations are performed for the optical afterglow of grb  030329 , and time variations of the polarization degree and angle ( pa ) were reported @xcite .",
    "recently , a polarization degree of @xmath9  % was reported for the early optical afterglow of grb  090102 , at hundreds of seconds since the burst trigger @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are controversies on polarization detections in the prompt @xmath0-ray emission of grbs .",
    "the first report was the detection of a high linear polarization of @xmath10  % at a confidence level of @xmath11 by rhessi from grb  021206 @xcite , although independent groups could not confirm any polarization signals by reanalyzing the same data @xcite .",
    "the second reports showed also high degree of polarization for grb  041219a with @xmath12  % @xcite and @xmath13  % @xcite for the brightest pulse in the 100350  kev energy band of integral - spi at @xmath14 confidence level for 2 parameters of interest ( @xmath2 and pa ) .",
    "@xcite also reported more significant detection for time resolved analyses , and suggested possible variable polarization properties for the same grb  041219a in the 200800  kev energy band observed with integral - ibis .",
    "however , @xcite set a strict upper limit of @xmath15  % for the same brightest pulse showing high @xmath2 in the integral - spi data @xcite .",
    "( @xcite explained that the null net polarization degree results from the superposition of signals with different polarization angles .",
    "however , this interpretation can not explain the positive detection by integral - spi simultaneously . ) these inconsistent results between spi and ibis led to confusion again , and the existence of @xmath0-ray polarization is still in debate .",
    "as the authors themselves pointed out in their reports , these results are with low statistics of @xmath16 level , and may be strongly affected by the instrumental systematics uncertainties @xcite .",
    "these controversies and conflicts indicate difficulties in detecting the @xmath0-ray polarization .    in this letter , we report the detection of @xmath0-ray polarization and also the change of pa for extremely bright grb  100826a using the newly developed grb polarimeter .",
    "our polarimeter is completely designed for the polarization measurement of prompt grbs , and well calibrated during developing phase before launch .",
    "especially , using a detector of proto - flight model , we experimentally and numerically understand the response for polarized @xmath0-ray with low systematic uncertainties . in the following sections , we show the observation ( section  2 ) , data analysis ( section  3 ) and discussion for the emission mechanism of the prompt grbs ( section  4 ) .",
    "ikaros @xcite ( interplanetary kite - craft accelerated by radiation of the sun ) is a small solar - power - sail demonstrator and was successfully launched on 21 may 2010 .",
    "ikaros has a large polyimide membrane of 20  m in diameter , and this translates the solar radiation pressure to the thrust of the spacecraft . since the deployment of the sail on 9 june 2010 , ikaros started the solar - sailing toward venus .",
    "the gamma - ray burst polarimeter ( gap ) @xcite aboard ikaros is fully designed to measure a degree of linear polarization in the prompt emission of grbs in the energy range of 70300 kev .",
    "the detection principle is an anisotropy of compton scattered photons . if the incident @xmath0-rays are linearly polarized , the distribution of scattered photons is due to klein - nishina effect which approximately shows @xmath17 curves , where @xmath18 is the scattering angle .",
    "the gap consists of a central plastic scatterer of 17  cm in diameter and 6  cm in thickness , and the surrounding 12 csi(tl ) scintillators with 5  mm in thickness .",
    "the coincidence events within a gate time of @xmath19 between the signal from any csi and that from the plastic are accepted for the polarization analysis .",
    "the gap s high axial symmetry in shape and the high gain uniformity are the keys for reliable measurement of polarizations , and to avoid a fake modulation due to background @xmath0-rays .",
    "there are no external parts of spacecraft inside the gap field of view .",
    "moreover the detector cases ( chassis ) , except for the detector top , are covered by thin lead sheets with 0.5  mm thickness .",
    "therefore the effect of background @xmath0-rays scattered by the spacecraft body are negligible .    the gap detected grb  100826a on 26 august 2010 at 22:57:20.8 ( ut ) on the way to venus at about 0.21  au apart from the earth . the lightcurve of the prompt emission is shown in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "this burst was also detected by several satellites , and was localized by an interplanetary network ( ipn ) @xcite . combining the gap data with the published ipn information , the direction of this burst is derived as @xmath20 , which corresponds to 20.0  degree off - axis from the center of the gap field of view .",
    "an energy fluence of this burst is @xmath21 in 20  kev10  mev band by konus @xcite , which is the top 1  % of the brightest events listed in batse catalog .",
    "the low- and high - energy photon indices are reported as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and the @xmath24 peak energy as @xmath25kev @xcite .",
    "an optical afterglow of this grb was not reported , so its redshift is unknown .",
    "we divided the entire data into two time intervals as labeled interval-1 and -2 in a lightcurve of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the total numbers of @xmath0-ray photons after subtracting background are 32,924 and 19,007 photons for each interval , respectively .",
    "the first part of this burst shows a large flare lasting 47  seconds since the trigger , and a following 53  seconds consists of multiple spikes .",
    "although the interval-2 has several spikes , we combined all of them to keep photon statistics .",
    "we used the background modulation curve obtained by the 36.7  hours integration just before and after the grb trigger time . in this case , the averaged coincidence background rate is quite stable as @xmath26 , and its modulation curve can be described as constant with the standard deviation of 0.1  % level . after subtracting the background modulation ,",
    "the total numbers of the coincidence @xmath0-rays ( polarization signals ) are 4,821 and 2,733 for interval-1 and -2 , respectively .      when we perform the polarization analysis , we calculated the model function ( or the detector response ) for the polarized gamma - rays with geant  4 monte - carlo simulator . a geometrical mass model of gap",
    "was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we can set all the possible situations with different off - axis angles , azimuthal phase angles , spectral parameters , as well as polarization degrees and angles of incoming @xmath0-rays .",
    "in this analysis , the free parameters are the polarization degrees and angles , since the other parameters are constrained as shown in section  2 .    simulating the interactions between the incoming gamma - rays and the geometrical mass model with monte - carlo method",
    ", we created the model functions of the modulation curves .",
    "then we selected the coincidence events between the plastic and one csi scintillator as the polarization signals .",
    "we simulated the model function with the step resolutions of 5  % for polarization degrees and 5  degrees for phase angles .",
    "we will fit the observed modulation curves with the model function by a least squares method in the following subsections .",
    "we should treat not only the statistical error but also the systematic uncertainties correctly . here , the systematic uncertainties mean any unexplainable difference between the observed modulation curve and the simulated one .",
    "imperfect tunings of parameters in the ground and in - orbit calibrations for the incident radiation , especially from off - axis direction , cause more important systematic uncertainty .",
    "first , we performed some ground based experiments with non - polarized radio isotopes @xmath27co ( 122  kev ) and @xmath28am ( 59.5  kev ) .",
    "they were set at the distance of 1.0  m from the center of proto - flight model with several incident angles from zero to 50  degrees with the step resolutions of 5  degrees .",
    "we measured experimental modulation curves for each setup .",
    "after that , on the assumption of non - polarized @xmath0-rays with the monochromatic energy of 122  kev and/or 59.5  kev , we calculated the numerical modulation curve with geant  4 simulator .",
    "then , of course , the both modulation curves show some discrepancy which can not be explained within the statistical uncertainty , because of instrumental systematic uncertainties .",
    "we calculated the standard deviation of two modulations and derived the systematic errors to be @xmath29  % of the total coincidence @xmath0-rays for the case of 20.0  degree incident angle .",
    "although this value is not negligible , the statistical error ( about @xmath30  % leves ) still dominates the systematic one in this case .",
    "we included the systematic uncertainty into the total errors as @xmath31 for each bin of polarization data .",
    "first of all , we performed the polarization analysis for the whole dataset of time interval of 0100  seconds .",
    "then we obtained an acceptable result with the model of non - polarized modulation curve , and set only upper limit of @xmath32  % ( @xmath14 confidence level ) .",
    "we consider the possibility that the polarization degree may be weak if the polarization angle changes during the entire burst duration , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we performed time resolved polarization analyses for datasets of interval-1 and -2 . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the observed source modulation curves as a function of scattering angle for both time intervals after subtraction of background .",
    "the error bars shown in figure  [ fig2 ] include not only the statistical uncertainty but also the 1.8  % of systematical one as estimated the above subsection .    at the first step , we investigated the polarization degrees , @xmath2 , and the polarization angle ( @xmath33 ) , measured from north with anticlockwise direction , separately for interval-1 and -2 .",
    "then , the response of gap for irradiation from 20.0  degree off - axis is modeled by the monte - carlo method with geant  4 simulator .",
    "the gray solid lines are the best - fit functions for interval-1 and -2 .",
    "the best values are @xmath34  % with @xmath35 degrees for interval-1 and @xmath36  % with @xmath37 degrees for interval-2 , respectively .",
    "hereafter the quoted errors are @xmath38 confidence for two parameters of interest .",
    "the significance of polarization detection is rather low of 95.4  % and 89.0  % for interval-1 and -2 , while the difference of polarization angles is significant with 99.9  % ( @xmath1 ) level .    in the next step",
    ", we performed a combined fit for the two intervals , assuming that the polarization degree for interval-2 is the same as that for interval-1 .",
    "this means that we treat @xmath2 as one free parameter to improve the statistics with the reduction of model parameters . here",
    "the two polarization angles were still free parameters for both intervals , because the change of angle is apparent .",
    "the best - fit polarization degree is @xmath39  % with @xmath40 for 19 degrees of freedom .",
    "we show a @xmath41 map in the @xmath42 plane in figure  [ fig3 ] , where we represent @xmath43 .",
    "the significance of detection of polarization is 99.4  % @xmath44 confidence level .",
    "gamma - ray detectors aboard rhessi and integral have complex geometry , the polarization analysis may be highly affected by the instrumental systematics as the authors mentioned @xcite .",
    "in contrast to them , gap is developed for the purpose of grb polarimetry with the high axial symmetry in shape .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is quantitatively estimated and found to be as small as 1.8  % of the total polarization signals , as described above . of course , gap is well calibrated for polarized gamma - rays before launch @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the prompt emission of grb , we conclude that this is probably the most convincing detection of polarization degree and angles so far .",
    "the emission mechanisms of grbs which are being actively discussed with the spectral and lightcurve information collected so far includes synchrotron emission of electrons at the optically - thin regions of relativistic jets and quasi - thermal emission from the photospheres of jets ( for a review , * ? ? ?",
    "our reliable polarimetric observations may help further constrain the emission mechanisms as well as the structure of the emission sites and the magnetic fields .",
    "the main results of our polarimetric observation of grb  100826a are : ( 1 ) the polarization degree averaged over the burst duration is @xmath39  % in the energy range of @xmath45  kev below @xmath46 ; and ( 2 ) the pa significantly varies from interval-1 to -2 .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that sizable net polarizations can be obtained both in the synchrotron and photospheric emission mechanisms .",
    "the synchrotron mechanism involves several different types of models with respect to magnetic field structure ( for reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( a ) synchrotron in globally ordered toroidal field ( so model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( b ) in random fields on plasma skin depth scales ( sr model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( c ) in random fields on hydrodynamic scales ( sh model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the sr model",
    ", the magnetic field directions are assumed to be random not isotropically but mainly in the plane perpendicular to the local expansion direction . in this case",
    "a high degree of polarization can be obtained only when the observer sees the jet slightly off - axis , i.e. , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the opening half angle and the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , ( d ) in the photospheric emission model ( ph model ) , we also expect the strongly polarized radiation when the radiation energy is comparable to or smaller than the baryon kinetic energy at the photosphere @xcite . around the photosphere the photon distribution is highly anisotropic , which can lead to high levels of polarization through the last electron scatterings ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for the other comptonization models ) .",
    "we need the condition @xmath47 also in this model to have a high net polarization .",
    "the above four models can be consistent with our result ( 1 ) .",
    "our result ( 2 ) provides us with very important information , which excludes the axisymmetric jets both in the synchrotron and photospheric emission models .",
    "if the emitting surface is symmetric around the jet axis as assumed by most of authors in the so , sr , and ph models , the direction of the net polarization in the high @xmath2 case is determined to be either parallel or perpendicular to the direction from the jet axis towards the line of sight .",
    "therefore we conclude that non - axisymmetric structure of the brightness and/or the magnetic fields on the observable angular scale @xmath6 are required to have the substantial change of pa ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a possible solution for the results ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is the patchy emission in the",
    "so , sr , or ph model , or the patchy magnetic field structure , i.e. , the sh model .",
    "for instance , the sh model produces the net polarization as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of independent patches with coherent magnetic field in the observable region .",
    "the polarization degree for @xmath53 can be consistent with the individual results for intervals-1 and -2 within the @xmath38 confidence .",
    "the angle of the averaged polarization is statistically random , so that they can be consistent with our result ( 2 ) .",
    "similar arguments may be made in the patchy so , sr , and ph models . in the patchy",
    "so model , the emission from each patch can have different pa easily when @xmath54 . in the patchy sr and ph models",
    ", we no longer require the off - axis viewing of the jet , and the emission from each of off - axis viewed patches has high @xmath2 and different pa .    how can we further constrain the models with the analysis results of other bursts detected by gap and the future polarimetry missions ?",
    "we note that the statistical analysis results of the so , sr and ph models in @xcite are not applicable since they assume the axisymmetric jets . in the ph model ,",
    "the patch scales are constrained as @xmath55",
    ". then high local polarizations are obtained from patches with @xmath56 , although their brightness is much smaller than that from patches with @xmath57 because of the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "thus it is not expected that all the bright bursts have a high net polarization in the patchy ph model .",
    "the statistical studies of the gap bursts might provide us some implications for further constraining the emission mechanism .",
    "this polarimetric observation for grb  100826a has been performed in the energy range below @xmath58 . in reality , the spectral indices @xmath59 of bursts below @xmath58 are not fully explained in the framework of synchrotron or photospheric mechanism . in the synchrotron mechanism , the radiative cooling of emitting electrons should not be so rapid to produce the spectrum sufficiently hard below @xmath58 , so that the emission region could be thick , unlike the thin shell emission assumed in many papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the photospheric models include an idea that the emission below @xmath58 is superposition of many quasi - thermal components with different temperature and/or @xmath50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly ,",
    "more studies on the energy dependence of polarization ( as well as the non - axisymmetric structure of the jet ) in each model are needed to discuss the observational results quantitatively .",
