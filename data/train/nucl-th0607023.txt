    "<S> our reanalysis leads us to the conclusion that the projection method introduced in  @xcite in order to restore the four transversality of the @xmath0-meson spectral function , @xmath1 , suffers from serious problems with kinematical singularities . </S>",
    "<S> as shown below these singularities lead to a _ spurious and unphysical _ massless mode of the @xmath0-meson , in turn leading to a further broadening of the pion modes and through the self - consistence finally to a strong broadening of the @xmath0-meson . in recent studies  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the authors alternatively used the projection method introduced by two of us @xcite and found a good agreement with the dimuon data of na60  @xcite on the basis of their collision - dynamic model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that also in this projection method there are ambiguities in the calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> * the analysis in detail : * the authors use a @xmath2-derivable self - consistent dyson - resummation scheme to evaluate self energies of vector mesons , which , a priori , is a promising method . </S>",
    "<S> however , it suffers from the violation of ward - takahashi identities at the two - point and higher - order vertex functions level , leading to a violation of current conservation within the self - consistent propagators although the expectation value of the current is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the artificial excitation of the unphysical four - dimensionally longitudinal mode of the vector meson and thus to a violation of unitarity .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to cure this defect the authors employed a naive projection scheme . in any iteration step of the self - consistent scheme it simply cuts off the undesired four - longitudinal components of the polarization tensor , @xmath3 , of the @xmath0-meson .    </S>",

    "<S> this fictitious mode always emerges unless the unprojected tensor is _ exactly _ four - transversal on the light - cone . </S>",
    "<S> it has the remarkable feature that for any given momentum @xmath15 , its energy - weighted integral strength ( obtained from the residue ) is about identical to the resonance strength integrated across @xmath16 ! </S>",
