    "it is well - known that the @xmath0 symmetry is broken in the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) by the anomaly due to the nontrivial topology of the principal bundle of gauge field  @xcite , which leads to the nondegeneracy of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons  @xcite . as a strong interacting system",
    "should approach its classic limit at high temperature , all the broken symmetries including the @xmath0 are expected to be restored in hot medium  @xcite . while the relation between the @xmath0 symmetry and chiral symmetry in vacuum and at finite temperature has been studied for a long time  @xcite , it is still an open question whether the @xmath0 symmetry is restored in chiral symmetric phase .",
    "the lattice simulation is a powerful tool to study qcd symmetries . by a proper definition ,",
    "the topological charge and its susceptibility are used to describe the @xmath0 anomaly in the pure gauge field theory and the unquenched theory  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the susceptibility drops down above the critical temperature @xmath4 of the chiral restoration , but the charge keeps an obvious deviation from zero at high temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the simulation for the instanton model shows such a partial restoration , too  @xcite . from the recent lattice simulations of hotqcd  @xcite and jlqcd  @xcite collaborations , while the @xmath0 symmetry is still broken at @xmath4 from both groups , the jlqcd claimed the @xmath0 restoration at @xmath6 and the hotqcd observed opposite result .    to clearly understand the relation between the @xmath0 and chiral symmetries , we need to put the qcd system in chiral limit where the chiral phase transition at high temperature is well defined . in real case with nonzero quark mass ,",
    "the chiral symmetry can not be fully restored by thermodynamics , and therefore one possible mechanism of the @xmath0 breaking at high temperature is the residual chiral breaking . since the chiral limit can not be realized in lattice calculations where a nonzero pion mass is always used , we need to consider effective models to clarify the relation between the two symmetries .",
    "two of the often employed models are the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl )  @xcite model at quark level  @xcite and the linear sigma model at hadron level  @xcite and including quarks ( quark - meson model )  @xcite . at finite temperature and density ,",
    "the two models are widely used to discuss chiral and @xmath0 properties of strongly interacting matters , see for instance @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the functional renormalization group ( frg ) method to study @xmath0 symmetry and its relation to chiral symmetry in the quark - meson model . as a nonperturbative method",
    ", the frg  @xcite has been used to study phase transitions in various systems like cold atom gas  @xcite , nucleon gas  @xcite , and hadron gas  @xcite . by solving the flow equation which connects physics at different momentum scales ,",
    "the frg shows a great power to describe the phase transitions and the corresponding critical phenomena which are normally difficult to be controlled in the mean - field approximation because of the absence of quantum fluctuations . instead of adding hot loops to the thermodynamic potential in the usual ways of going beyond mean field , the fluctuations are included in the frg effective action through running the rg scale from ultraviolet limit to infrared limit , which , as an advantage , can automatically guarantee the nambu - goldstone theorem in the symmetry breaking phase .",
    "based on our previous works in the linear sigma  @xcite and njl  @xcite models where we focused on the meson masses , we calculate here in the @xmath1 quark - meson model the topological susceptibility and @xmath7 mixing angle which describe directly and clearly the degree of @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "we will see that while the @xmath0 is controlled by chiral condensates in the chiral breaking phase , it is dominated by fluctuations after the chiral symmetry is restored .",

    "we first define in the quark - meson model the correspondent of the topological charge density @xmath8 of qcd and then calculate analytically the topological susceptibility @xmath9 . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we briefly review the frg application to the quark - meson model and introduce the pseudoscalar meson s mixing angle @xmath10 . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we numerically solve the frg flow equations with grid method and show the temperature dependence of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons as well as the mixing angle and the topological susceptibility .",
    "we summarize in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the topological susceptibility is a fundamental correlation function in qcd and is the key to understanding the dynamics in the @xmath0 channel . in this section",
    "we calculate the topological susceptibility at finite temperature within the framework of the three - flavor quark - meson model .    in qcd the axial current @xmath11 is not conserved due to the @xmath0 anomaly induced by the instanton effect , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the current quark mass , @xmath14 the number of flavors , and @xmath8 the topological charge density @xmath15 with the gluon field strength tensor @xmath16 and the coupling constant @xmath17 between quark and gluon fields . the topological susceptibility @xmath9 is defined as the fourier transform of the connected correlation function @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the time - ordering operator .",

    "<S> we study @xmath0 symmetry and its relation to chiral symmetry at finite temperature through the application of functional renormalization group to the @xmath1 quark meson model . very different from the mass gap and mixing angel between @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons which are defined at mean field level and behavior like the chiral condensates , the topological susceptibility includes a fluctuations induced part which becomes dominant at high temperature . as a result , the @xmath0 symmetry is still considerably broken in the chiral symmetry restoration phase . </S>"
