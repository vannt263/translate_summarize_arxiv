    "recently , a detailed study of the reactions @xmath6 and @xmath7 was performed for @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "these processes involve the @xmath9 and @xmath10 vertex functions respectively which are calculated at low photon virtuality and low di - meson invariant mass using resonance chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dynamics is shown to be dominated by electromagnetic form factors and meson - meson amplitudes .",
    "this calculation , valid for low intermediate photon virtuality is improved replacing the lowest order terms in the form factors by the full form factors at the required @xmath12 as extracted from experiment or by the unitarized form factors .",
    "likewise , the lowest order terms in the meson - meson amplitudes are replaced by the unitarized meson - meson amplitudes containing the scalar poles .",
    "the related process @xmath13 has been also studied in the context of nambu - jona - lasinio models @xcite .    in the @xmath6 case ,",
    "the calculation reproduces the background in the total cross section but not the peak around @xmath14 mev , discovered by babar @xcite and confirmed by bes in @xmath15 @xcite and belle also in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the babar values for the mass and width of this new resonance , known as @xmath5 or @xmath17 , are @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite , which are consistent with bes , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite , and belle , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite results .",
    "as pointed out in a recent review @xcite , the narrow width is at odds with the large decay width into two mesons predicted in models for @xmath24 states @xcite , diquark - anti - diquark states @xcite , tetraquark @xmath25 states @xcite or gluon hybrids @xmath26 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another proposal for the nature of @xmath5 , which turns out to be consistent with the observed mass and width , is a three - body @xmath27 system @xcite .",
    "the result of this framework is a neat resonance peak around a total mass of @xmath28 and an invariant mass for the @xmath29 system around @xmath30 , quite close to the @xmath31 mass .",
    "the state appears in the isospin @xmath32 sector , and qualifies as a @xmath33 resonance .",
    "interestingly , the theory also shows that there is no resonance in the isovector channel .",
    "this is the main motivation to study the reaction @xmath34 , whose final state is in a pure isovector state .",
    "in this work we apply the same formalism as in @xcite to the production of @xmath36 .",

    "we will address the corresponding diagrams as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , when we have the direct photon coupling and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , when the coupling goes through the exchange of a vector meson .    at the energy of the reaction,@xmath51gev",

    "the @xmath56 interaction in this diagram is dictated by the anomalous chiral lagrangian @xcite which we rewrite in terms of the tensor field as @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",

    "( [ finalamp ] , [ jdecay ] ) we can see that the dynamics is dominated by two main effects in the @xmath78 vertex function which occur at two different energy scales : the leading order terms for the @xmath66 on - shell scattering amplitude at the di - meson invariant mass scale , @xmath79 , and the electromagnetic meson form factors at the energy of the reaction , @xmath80 .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath78 vertex function involved in this amplitude is strictly accurate for low di - meson invariant mass and low virtuality of the photon .",

    "the mechanisms studied here were shown to be responsible for the production of most of the events in the case of the @xmath61 final state except for the resonant events due to the @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the @xmath138 final state studied in @xcite , within the limitations due to the extraction of the @xmath139 isovector transition form factor from data , a good description of experimental points is obtained but there seems to be room for additional contributions around @xmath140 . in this case , the @xmath138 system can be in both isoscalar and isovector states hence the natural candidate for additional contributions is an isovector companion of the @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , in the three - body description of the @xmath5 proposed in @xcite , no peak is generated in the isovector channel .",
    "our calculation of the pure isovector channel @xmath141 under the mechanisms studied in @xcite yields a cross section of the same size as that of @xmath142 and thus within the reach of present @xmath4 machines .",
    "if there is no such a thing as an isovector companion of the @xmath5 as expected from @xcite , then our result is a concrete theoretical prediction for the @xmath141 cross section ; otherwise , the isovector companion must contribute to this process yielding valuable information on the nature of mesons at this energy .",
