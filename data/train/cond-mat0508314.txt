    "[ mech ] ) . the energy change associated with the process of transformation at a particular stage",
    "is given by the difference between the energy of the incomplete bilayer island and that of the initial monolayer island .",
    "this is in fact a conservative version of the mechanism observed by khor and das sarma in 1 + 1 dimensions.@xcite",
    "in our previous work in ( 1 + 1)d models , it was established that monolayer - high islands are stable against bilayer islands up to some critical volume or number of atoms @xmath10 ; in turn , bilayer islands are stable against trilayer islands up to another critical number @xmath11 ; etc.@xcite the mono - bilayer transformation was considered as the first step of the overall 2d-3d transformation and a critical misfit was determined from the misfit dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "the latter was found to increase with decreasing misfit diverging at a critical value @xmath12 . above the critical misfit ,",
    "the coherent stranski - krastanov mode is favored against the layer - by - layer growth followed by introduction of misfit dislocations .",

    "figure [ e12 ] shows that the total energies of mono- and bilayer islands under tensile stress containing the same total number of atoms are very close to each other compared with the corresponding behavior in compressed overlayers .",
    "as will be shown below this leads to the conclusion that even for @xmath15 , determined as the crossing point of the curves corresponding to monolayer and bilayer islands in fig .",
    "[ e12 ] , the probability of the 2d-3d transformation remains nearly equal to the probability of the reverse 3d-2d transformation .",

    "decreasing @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is assumed equal to unity ) in such a way that the ratio @xmath20 is kept constant ( in this case equal to 8/7 ) , shifts the intersection points @xmath10 to larger absolute values of the misfit . as a result , a critical size @xmath10 in compressed",

    "this points to a novel mechanism of 2d-3d transformation which differs from the consecutive formation of bilayer , trilayer , etc .",

    "the inserts show the curves at the beginning of the transformation with enlarged scales.,width=321 ]    the misfit behavior of the critical nucleus size @xmath37 is also similar to that found in the theory of nucleation .",
    "the nucleus size decreases with increasing misfit , reaching eventually only one atom just as the nucleus size on the supersaturation in nucleation theory.@xcite it is interesting to note that the critical nuclei contain always a number of atoms which _ exceeds _ by one atom the size of a compact cluster , and is _ not _ one atom short of being a compact cluster , as might be expected from too - simplistic energetic considerations on the basis of bond - counting arguments .",
    "the reason is that the highest departure from compactness giving the maximum of the @xmath35 curve is achieved when the additional atom creates two kink positions for the attachment of the next row of atoms .    on the contrary , in expanded overlayers ,",
    "the number of atoms at which the transformation curve reaches its highest value does not depend on the misfit ( fig .",
    "[ height ] ) , demonstrating the non - nucleation behavior of the process .",
    "this number is roughly equal to the number of atoms which completes the upper level minus the number of atoms required to build the last four edge rows of the upper level in order to produce four facets .",
    "a special feature of the above results is that the barriers for expanded overlayers are in general larger than those for compressed overlayers .",
    "having in mind that the typical time needed for the transformation to occur is inversely proportional to @xmath52 , we have to expect much longer times for the occurrence of the 2d-3d transformation in expanded overlayers as compared with compressed ones particularly at larger values of the misfit",
    ". thus limitations of kinetic origin ( astronomically long times for second layer nucleation ) are expected in expanded overlayers and at small misfits in compressed overlayers .",
    "figure  [ n12dg ] compares the misfit dependences of the critical island size @xmath10 , the critical 2nd - layer nucleus size @xmath37 and the height of the nucleation barrier @xmath36 for compressed overlayers .",
    "the tree curves display a similar behavior increasing steeply with decreasing misfit , with @xmath10 showing a critical behavior at the critical misfit @xmath12 .",
    "as will be discussed below , the 2d-3d transformation will be inhibited for kinetic reasons at values of the misfit not sufficiently larger than @xmath12 .",
    "in compressed overlayers the atoms interact with their in - plane neighbours through the steeper repulsive branch of the interatomic potential .",
    "this means that compressed overlayers are effectively `` stiffer '' than expanded overlayers .",
    "then compressed pseudomorphic overlayers will contain a larger amount of elastic energy than expanded pseudomorphic ones of the same thickness and bonding strength .",
    "another consequence is that the accumulation of strain energy with thickness in compressed overlayers will be steeper than in expanded overlayers . or",
    ", the strain energy of a bilayer will differ considerably from that of a monolayer from both sides of the critical size @xmath10 compared with expanded islands as seen in fig .",
    "this is the reason why expanded overlayers require greater force constants in order for the monolayer islands to become unstable against bilayer islands .",
    "this is also the reason why the critical sizes @xmath10 are larger in expanded than in compressed overlayers of the same force constant as seen in fig .  [ gamma ] .",
    "figure  [ deltae ] illustrates the central result of our study .",
    "it shows the energy of transformation of compressed and expanded monolayer islands . in compressed overlayers",
    "the overall fall of the energy begins when a small cluster ( three atoms in this particular case ) is formed in the second level .",
    "this is a typical phase transition of first order - nucleation followed by irreversible growth.@xcite in expanded overlayers the energy increases up to nearly the end of the transformation and then abruptly collapses .",
    "this collapse of the energy is connected with the transfer of the remaining last edge rows of atoms which leads to the coalescence of the lower and upper steps to produce four side facets . in the particular transfer process considered in the calculation",
    ", there are two regions , one before the beginning of the collapse , the second between the two sub - collapses , where the total energy rises slightly ; this is due to the energetic cost of repulsion between steps that are very close , separated only by a single atomic row .",
    "the reason for this  non - nucleation \" behavior is the effectively weaker expanded bonds which results in relatively close energies of the monolayer and bilayer islands . with increasing size of the second level cluster ,",
    "the misfit strain is not as effectively relaxed as in the case of compressed islands and the collapse of the energy is due to the replacements of isolated repulsing steps by low - energy facets .",
    "the different transformation behavior can be understood on the basis of the above considerations accounting in addition for the finite size of the islands . during the transformation of the monolayer islands we should expect a relaxation of the in - plane strain , which is the driving force for the transformation and an increase of the total energy of interaction between the lower level of the island and the substrate and between both levels of the island.@xcite",
    "the physics behind the process of mono - bilayer transformation is the same as behind the formation of 3d islands on the wetting layer .",
    "@xcite formation and growth of new steps and relaxation of the strain stored in the monolayer island compete in the process . in addition",
    ", the steps in the first and second levels repel each other and the associated repulsion energy increases towards the completion of the transformation to disappear when the steps coalesce to give rise to microfacets .",
    "epitaxial strain is relaxed at the islands edges.@xcite edge atoms are displaced from the bottoms of their respective potential troughs giving rise to relaxation of the bonds parallel to the surface ( in - plane stress relaxation ) .",
    "the displaced atoms loose contact with the substrate atoms , which leads to an increase of the out - of - plane energy of interaction with the underlying substrate.@xcite during the transformation , new edges on top of the initial monolayer island are formed and the total length of the edges increases as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the number of atoms in the initial monolayer island and the current number of transferred atoms in the second level , respectively . note that the energy of repulsion between the edges bounding the lower and upper islands is implicitly accounted for by both the in - plane and out - of - plane energies .",
    "then a larger number of atoms are displaced from the bottom of their respective potential troughs during the transformation process and the total in - plane strain - relaxation energy decreases .",
    "simultaneously , the out - of - plane interaction energy increases . owing to the weaker attractive forces in expanded overlayers , only a small number of bonds close to the edges are relaxed .",
    "@xcite most of the bonds at the center of the islands are strained to fit the underlying wetting layer . as a result , the average relaxation in expanded islands is smaller than in compressed islands , where even bonds at the center of medium - sized islands are partly relaxed . in compressed overlayers ,",
    "the decrease of the in - plane strain energy rapidly overcompensates the increase of the out - of - plane interaction energy which results in a nucleation - like transformation curve ( fig .",
    "[ strains ] ) . in expanded overlayers ,",
    "the absolute value of the total in - plane strain energy is smaller than the out - of - plane interaction energy with the exception of the final stage when the monolayer - high steps disappear to produce facets of small surface energy .",
    "the typical time required for the appearance of a second - layer nucleus is inversely proportional to the nucleation frequency @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the area of the critical monolayer island and @xmath42 is the pre - exponential of the nucleation rate . as seen in fig .",
    "[ height ] , in the case of @xmath23 , the barrier height increases approximately 5  times in an interval of @xmath58 of 2.5  % whereas the number of atoms in the critical nucleus @xmath37 increases nearly 70  times . for a greater force",
    "constant ( @xmath33 ) , the increase of both @xmath36 and @xmath37 is even larger : 20 and 110 times , respectively , in a smaller misfit interval of about 1.5  % .",
    "the energy to break a first - neighbor bond , @xmath19 , for most semiconductor materials is of the order of 2 to 2.5 ev ( the enthalpy of evaporation is of the order of 4 to 5 ev ) .",
    "assuming @xmath10 is of the order of 100 - 120 atoms we could expect a mono - bilayer transformation to take place at misfits for which @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the reason is that the pre - exponential @xmath42 in 2d nucleation rate from vapor is usually of the order of @xmath61 @xmath62s@xmath63.@xcite otherwise , due to the exponential dependence , times of the order of centuries would be required for second - layer nucleation.@xcite thus , although in compressed overlayers second - layer nucleation can be expected for thermodynamic reasons at misfits above @xmath12 , a real 2d-3d transition can only take place at even larger misfits or higher temperatures for kinetic reasons .",
    "as the height of the transformation barriers in expanded overlayers is always greater than several times @xmath19 , the mono - bilayer transformation should be strongly inhibited for kinetic reasons .",
    "we conclude that the case of a layer - by - layer mechanism for the 2d-3d transformation is expected only in compressed overlayers at misfits sufficiently larger than @xmath12 .",
    "the reason is that the mechanism of the mono - bilayer transformation is nucleation - like due to the interplay of relaxation of the in - plane strain , which is proportional to the total edge length and the increase of the total edge energy and repulsion between the edges .",

    "non - nucleation \" behavior characterized by an overall increase of the energy up to the stage when the single steps coalesce to produce low - energy facets .",
    "the latter is accompanied by a collapse of the energy .",
    "the maximum energy is large and 2d-3d transformation of expanded overlayers is not expected for kinetic reasons even for materials with strong interatomic bonds .",

    "<S> the transformation of monolayer islands into bilayer islands as a first step of the overall two - dimensional to three - dimensional ( 2d-3d ) transformation in the coherent stranski - krastanov mode of growth is studied for the cases of expanded and compressed overlayers . </S>",
    "<S> compressed overlayers display a nucleation - like behavior : the energy accompanying the transformation process displays a maximum at some critical number of atoms , which is small for large enough values of the misfit , and then decreases gradually down to the completion of the transformation , non - monotonically due to the atomistics of the process . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the energy change in expanded overlayers increases up to close to the completion of the transformation and then abruptly collapses with the disappearance of the monoatomic steps to produce low - energy facets . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of transformation takes place only in materials with strong interatomic bonding . </S>",
    "<S> softer materials under tensile stress are expected to grow predominantly with a planar morphology until misfit dislocations are introduced , or to transform into 3d islands by a different mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the coherent stranski - krastanov growth in expanded overlayers is much less probable than in compressed ones for kinetic reasons . </S>"
