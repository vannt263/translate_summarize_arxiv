    "our current understanding of massive star - forming regions remains poor , despite their importance in the structure and evolution of galactic systems , due to their strong feedback . from an observational point of view , a number of reasons make the study of massive star formation a challenging topic in astrophysics , as pointed out in the comprehensive review on the issue by @xcite",
    ". regions of massive star formation are highly embedded in thick layers of dust during the crucial early stages of their existence .",
    "in addition , these early stages are short - lived , leaving little time for the study of their evolution .",
    "another problem is the lack of spatial resolution in the observations .",
    "most of extragalactic giant star forming regions are often contained within a single pixel .",
    "finally , most massive stars form in close proximity to each other , and their mutual influence via gravitational interaction , powerful outflows , supernova events and strong winds contributes to the complexity of the problem .",
    "observations of nearby star forming regions provide an excellent laboratory for the study of a particular aspect of this interaction , namely the triggering of new star formation events by gas compression resulting either from a ionization shock front created by the radiation field of a previous generation of stars , or by the supersonic shocks of a supernova event . in the classical theory by @xcite ,",
    "an ionization front compresses an adjacent layer of molecular gas and heats it , producing a gravitational instability that will eventually result in a new generation of stars . in order to test this and other theories of triggered star formation",
    ", it is important to unequivocally determine and quantify the amount of currently ongoing star formation in giant hii  regions ( ghiirs ) , and its relation to the ionizing radiation from previous generations of stars .",
    "after 30 doradus , ngc  604 is the second most massive ghiir in the local group .",
    "located in the triangle galaxy ( m33 ) at a distance of 0.84  mpc @xcite , it harbors several associations of massive stars distributed across an area of about 200  pc on the side , dominated by a cluster containing @xmath6 ob stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these associations have excavated a complex system of filaments and cavities of ionized material surrounded by photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) and molecular gas ( see , for example * ? ? ? * for a discussion on the spatial distribution of emission in the region ) .",
    "optical studies reveal an age of the region between 3 and 5 myr @xcite and a total stellar mass of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "individual co molecular clouds have been detected with sizes between 5 and 29  pc and with masses of between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "measured values of the average optical extinction in the region vary from @xmath10 @xcite to @xmath11 @xcite . @xcite",
    "also derive a star formation of about @xmath12 , which can be interpreted in terms of the total mass of a coeval stellar population .",
    "several attempts have been made to quantify the total amount of ongoing massive star formation in ngc  604 . using near - infrared ( nir ) color - color diagrams ,",
    "@xcite identify several massive young stellar object ( myso ) candidates , with well - defined infrared excesses .",
    "they also note that these candidates coincide spatially with radio - peak structures , reinforcing their star - forming nature .",
    "more recently , @xcite report the discovery of sources with near infrared excess within the infrared - bright ridges surrounding the ionized gas , and associate them with mysos .",
    "@xcite argue that the reddening observed towards some prominent sources in the region can be explained by the existence of foreground molecular material , but they do not rule out the possibility of those sources being embedded sites of star formation .",
    "the use of infrared spectrometry combined with physical modeling provides a powerful tool to distinguish between foreground extinction and embedded star formation , by fitting the spectra with independent models that correspond to each situation , or to a combination of both .",
    "this complements photometric methods that use near - infrared color - color and color - magnitude diagrams to discriminate between the two cases , as the one described in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a comprehensive analysis of the physical conditions in ngc  604 in the context of its evolutionary status , and investigate the presence of ongoing massive star formation in the region .",
    "we use infrared spectral and photometric data from the _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ space telescopes , complemented with archival x - ray and optical data , as well as a set of analytical tools to interpret them .",
    "we report the discovery of individual infrared knots whose derived masses are consistent with them being stellar cluster in process of formation .",
    "this is also supported by bayesian fitting of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the region , which points to the presence of a significant component of embedded objects in the region .",
    "we derive line emission and continuum maps of ngc  604 and use them to assess the variations in radiation field strength , ionization levels and extinction across the ghiir , and find that our results are consistent with a sequential star formation history in the last @xmath13myr .",
    "we also discuss some additional findings regarding the role of x - ray emission in the enhancement of both [ siii ] atomic emission and 17  @xmath14  pah emission .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : observations ] we present the irs data and describe the data reduction to obtain the maps and the spatially integrated spectrum of ngc  604 .  [ sec : analysis ] describes the resulting maps and spectra , as well as the tools used to extract physical information from the observations . in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the results of our analysis in terms of the current evolutionary stage of ngc  604 and the presence of ongoing star formation in the region .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our main results in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "most of our analysis will be based on _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite data of a region encompassing the bulk of infrared emission from ngc  604 .",
    "however , to provide more robust constraints on the physics of the region , we also use complementary photometry from the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite and from the _ herschel space observatory _ photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , we use archival images from _ hubble space telescope wide field and planetary camera 2 _",
    "( wfpc2 ) and _ chandra x - ray observatory advanced ccd imaging spectrometer _ ( acis ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ irs provides unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity as compared to any previous mid - ir spectroscopic observations of the ngc  604 region . the spectral resolving power ranges from @xmath15 at short wavelengths to @xmath16 at the long - wavelength edge . with a 512  s exposure , point source sensitivity limit between 0.1 and 10  mjy in the 5 - 38  @xmath14  range ,",
    "the irs is about 100 times more sensitive than the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , while the spatial resolution is a factor of 10 larger .",
    "all the observations presented in this section were obtained in january 2006 using the irs mapping and staring modes for spectroscopy , as part of the program _ comparative study of galactic and extragalactic hii  regions _ ( p.  i.  j. houck ) .",
    "the mapping mode consists of the acquisition of slit spectra using a grid of positions around a central target . only the low resolution modules short - low ( sl1 , sl2 ) and long - low ( ll1 , ll2 ) of the irs were used for the ngc  604 map presented in this paper . for the sl modules ,",
    "12 slit pointings were made with each of the two spectrometer orders covering an area on the sky of about @xmath17 , which corresponds to a physical scale of about @xmath18 at the distance of ngc  604 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n604_bg ] ) .",
    "the slice width for the sl modules is @xmath19 , corresponding to a pixel scale of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . for the ll modules ,",
    "the slice width is @xmath22 , which corresponds to a pixel scale of @xmath23 ( 20.5@xmath24 ) and 6 pointings were made with each order to cover an area of about @xmath25 .",
    "in addition to the spectral map with the irs low resolution modules ( lores data hereafter ) , staring mode spectra were also obtained with the irs for three specific locations within the region ( hires data here after ) . in this `` point and",
    "shoot '' mode , the targets are placed in the center of one or several of the slits for a specified integration time . in staring mode , only the high resolution modules of the spectrometer were used , namely short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) . the wavelength coverage is shorter ( between 9.9  @xmath14  and 38.0  @xmath14 ) , but the resolving power is significantly higher ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the locations of the staring mode observations are within the area of the spectral map and correspond approximately to the positions of the peaks of 8  @xmath14  emission , associated with pah emission , as discussed later .",
    "the high resolution slits are wider than their low resolution counterparts ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 for sh and lh , respectively ) ; therefore their spectral apertures are also larger than the pixel scale of the lore spectral map .",
    "the area of the lores map and the locations of the staring mode hires spectra within the map are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n604_rgb_map_first ] .      for the staring mode data , the spitzer science center tool irsclean was used to remove cosmic rays .",
    "then , smart v.8.0 was used with the full aperture mode for extended sources , based on the size of the slits compared to the source ngc  604 , which is large enough to be considered extended .",
    "the observation cycles were co - added and the sky background removed using an additional off - source background exposure taken as part of the campaign .",
    "we have applied a scaling factor to the fluxes extracted in the lh module to match the overlap region in the sh module .",
    "this is an aperture correction to account for the larger size of the lh slit with respect to the sh slit .",
    "the scaling factors for the lh spectra towards fields a , b , and c are 0.28 , 0.41 , and 0.41 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n604_rgb_map_first ] ) .    for the spectral map",
    ", we extracted the spatially integrated spectrum of the region for all four irs orders using a extraction aperture corresponding to the sl coverage of the map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n604_rgb_map_first ] ) , which includes the bulk of the ir emission of ngc  604 .",
    "some of the extended filamentary structure of the region , which is one order of magnitude dimmer than the peaks of emission , is left outside this area .",
    "the low surface brightness of these filaments and the bubble - like geometry that we will assume when modeling the region implies that this will be unimportant for the purposes of the present analysis .",
    "the background subtraction was performed using the order of the sl and ll modules that was not centered at the source during the corresponding exposure .",
    "cubism performs the data cube build - up once the background and the correct slit pointings have been provided .",
    "the background levels are not exactly the same for the sl and ll modules .",
    "the reason is that the orientation of opposite orders of the slit is different for different modules . in the case of the low resolution modules ,",
    "the background picks up some emission from m33 s spiral arm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n604_bg ] ) .",
    "this background emission from the spiral arm is our best estimate for the sky levels in the sl modules .",
    "for reference , the measured irac 8  @xmath14  flux levels on the spiral arm ( @xmath29mjy  sr@xmath30 ) are only 20% higher than the sky level outside the arm ( @xmath31mjy  sr@xmath30 ) , and correspond to about 7% of the peak of 8  @xmath14  emission in the region .",
    "spectra can be extracted from each spatial pixel of the resulting data cube .",
    "the spatially integrated spectrum over the entire aperture is obtained by summing up the individual spectra of all resolution elements .",
    "we use the same extraction area for all modules and orders using the tools provided by cubism to make sure that the final spectrum for each order corresponds to the same physical region .",
    "in addition to the spectrum of the integrated region , we have extracted the lores spectra of individual sources that we discuss in  [ sec : individual_sources ] . for this extraction",
    "we use an aperture of a single sl pixel ( 1@xmath32.85 ) .",
    "the cubism software allows us to extract the spectra in the ll spectral module with this small aperture , by scaling down the fluxes of the larger ll pixels to the sl sizes .",
    "this is equivalent to applying a scaling factor to match the different orders of irs spectra , and introduces additional flux uncertainties in the long wavelength modules , where the psf is not well sampled .",
    "nonetheless , we consider this scaling a good approximation of the actual fluxes at smaller scales , since the sl pixels are not sufficiently small to resolve the sources , and the ll pixels are not large enough to include more than one source .    by selecting a single pixel aperture , we have chosen to loose some spatial information on the individual sources , because a single pixel samples only half of the psf fwhm , and in exchange we avoid off - source flux contamination",
    ". more important than a full sampling of the psf for our analysis , are the variations of the psf with wavelength , that might introduce artifacts in the measured spectral features . using calibration data , @xcite characterized the psf variations with wavelength for the irs reconstructed psfs .",
    "apart from an undulating behavior of the psf size with wavelength , that they attribute to alignment issues and to the reconstruction algorithm used , they compute variations of less that 10% on the psf fwhm for the sl module .",
    "such variations are below the observational errors in our data , described in  [ sec : pacs_photo ] and [ sec : continuum_em ] .",
    "the psf of the ll module is affected by fringing and is difficult to characterize .",
    "as part of the same spitzer program , irac maps of the ngc  604 region were obtained at 3.6  @xmath14 , 4.5  @xmath14 , 5.8  @xmath14 , and 8  @xmath14 .",
    "the pixel scale for these maps is @xmath33 , and they cover an area of about @xmath34 , several times larger than the area covered by the spectral map . for the purpose of this paper we have extracted the integrated flux of each map within a rectangular aperture area equal to the extraction area of the irs spectral map .",
    "we perform this extraction using the funtools package for the sao _",
    "ds9 _ software .",
    "the sky background is estimated from the map by measuring the flux in a box of the same size as the map , but shifted to the west , to an area where no source emission is observed . in table",
    "[ tab : irac_phot ] we list the measured fluxes .",
    "the listed uncertainties correspond to absolute flux calibration uncertainties ( @xmath35 ) , which are derived for point sources taking several systematic effects into account , such as array position dependence , pixel phase dependence , color correction , and aperture correction , as described in @xcite .",

    "such distribution is a function of the total heating flux incident on the dust grains . for a spherical expanding nebula ,",

    "the discrepancy is most likely due to the specific pah template used in the d&g models , which is an empirical template based on observations of starburst galaxies .",
    "the choice of metallicity does not only affect the pah emission strength . at far - ir wavelengths ,",

    "in mg11 we have included a discussion of the observational uncertainties involved in measuring the irs fluxes , which include absolute and relative flux calibrations and systematic errors due to specific observing conditions .",
    "based on that discussion , for fitting purposes we have adopted a uniform uncertainty of 10% across the irs wavelengths , which also implies a uniform weighting for all data points in the fitting .    the @xmath106 minimization procedure",
    "described in mg11 has been slightly modified here to ensure that the @xmath106 minimization is not dominated by the irs range , which has many more resolution elements , as compared to only two data points at 100  @xmath14  and 160  @xmath14  from pacs .",
    "each bin contributes to the @xmath106 with a weight that is proportional to the bin size in the logarithmic wavelength space .",

    "this results in a weighting function that increases uniformly in the irs range so that the bins at the short wavelength end ( around 5  @xmath14 ) have about half the weight of those at 35  @xmath14 and about 0.25 times the weight of the pacs bins . in section  [ sec : evolutionary ] we apply this tool to the observed sed of ngc  604 .      the d&g models compute the monochromatic flux densities for each wavelength bin",

    "before we compare the model fluxes to the observed pacs photometry , it is necessary to evaluate the errors introduced by this difference .",
    "to do so , we adopt the method described in @xcite to predict the flux density of a source when observed using a given filter . according to their approach ,",

    "first , the physical projected area covered in our ngc  604 map is relatively larger than the projected area of the 30 doradus map , and hence there is some missing emission from the periphery in the latter case that does not enter the sed .",
    "second , we observe in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdfs_c ] a degeneracy between the cluster mass and the fraction of the total luminosity from pdrs that covers a range of masses of @xmath140dex .",
    "a similar degeneracy was found for 30 doradus in mg11 .",
    "we have argued that the reason for this degeneracy is the fact that both the pdr and the pure hii  region spectra contribute to the dust thermal continuum .",
    "an increase in pah from emission is accompanied by an increase in the overall infrared luminosity .",
    "this also renders the additional far - infrared data insufficient to solve this degeneracy .",
    "optical wavelengths data , where the emission from pdr is significantly different from that of an hii  region , are needed to settle this issue .",
    "nevertheless , although our result is subject to this @xmath141 degeneracy , a comparison between our derived masses and the masses derived for 30 doradus and ngc  604 in @xcite and @xcite respectively , implies that our bayesian fitting tool can find solutions that are in reasonable agreement with published literature values .    a brief discussion on the mass of the individual infrared sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : n604_rgb_map_first_b ] is relevant here .",
    "although the sed models are not intended to reproduce ensembles of embedded objects but entire hii  regions , we fit their spectra using our tool to estimate their individual masses . in fig .",

    "note that the masses of these sources are of the order of a few times @xmath142 .",
    "this is the case for all the other sources , which are similarly luminous .",
    "although we do not attempt a detailed interpretation of the fitted parameters , because we are aware of the limits of our models , it is qualitatively interesting that we derive a higher pdr contribution and a higher fraction of embedded mass for source 1 than for source 5 , which is consistent with the latter being in a region dominated by stars older than 10  myr ( see  [ sec : notable ] ) .      both the _ instantaneous burst _ approach that leads to a single , coeval stellar population and the _ continuum star formation rate _ approach that leads to a uniform distribution of stellar ages , are opposite idealizations of the star formation history in a particular starburst region . in fact , rather than showing one of these limiting situations , it is often found that several star formation events in a particular region lead to different stellar populations of different ages .",
    "ngc  604 is not an exception to this rule .",
    "@xcite argue that the populations of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and red supergiants ( rsg ) in ngc  604 belong to different formation events , with estimated ages of @xmath143myr and @xmath144myr , respectively .",
    "a similar situation is observed in other giant hii  regions such as 30 doradus .    henceforth , when we refer here to the age of the region what we mean is the age of the dominating stellar population , which is usually composed of the youngest , most massive main sequence stars in these systems . as we have already discussed",
    ", most of the infrared continuum and line emission up to wavelengths of 100  @xmath14 , arises from the interaction of the strong radiation field from young ( @xmath145myr ) stars and the surrounding ism . only at longer wavelengths ,",
    "diffuse dust heated by older stellar populations starts to dominate the sed . in the following",
    "we discuss how our best fit parameters for ngc  604 help us constrain the age of its dominating stellar population .",
    "the fraction of total mass contained in embedded objects that we measure here for ngc  604 ( @xmath146 ) is smaller than that measured for 30 doradus in mg11 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "if we interpret this result in terms of recent star formation taking place in these two regions , this suggests that 30 doradus has a larger relative amount of mass in embedded objects , but this conclusion should be taken with caution , since other dust heating mechanisms can play a role .",
    "additionally , the age of @xmath148 derived with our fitting method is consistent with the study of the line ratios that we presented in  [ sec : hardness ] and agrees well with the studies by @xcite and @xcite . in mg11 using the same method , for 30 doradus we have obtained an age of @xmath149 .",
    "our results suggest that the dominating stellar population in each of these two giant hii regions ( i.e. , the one that provides most of the ionizing photons ) are consistent with slightly different model ages when variations in all model parameters are considered      although the fraction of total luminosity arising in pdrs is degenerate with the total cluster mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs_c ] , our result from sed fitting suggests that at least half of the energy output from ngc  604 is generated in pdrs , the other half arising in ionized regions closer to the cluster stars .",
    "the presence of a luminous pdr in ngc  604 is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who find considerably high amounts of atomic hydrogen ( @xmath150 ) , and associate them with the photodissociation of @xmath151 in a dense ( @xmath152 ) pdr .      the @xmath153 excitation temperature near field c ( @xmath154 ) , calculated using eq .",
    "[ h2_temp ] is indicative of the average temperature of the warm gas in ngc  604 .",
    "additionally , for a given value of the molecule angular momentum , the total number of hydrogen molecules is proportional to the strength of the line .",
    "our results on the h@xmath82 s(1 ) line , which has smaller uncertainties ( table [ tab : h2_lines ] ) , indicate that warm molecular hydrogen is present in fields a , b , and c and slightly more abundant towards field a , which has the strongest h@xmath82 lines .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who report the detection of an arc - like distribution of warm and dense molecular gas that extends across coincident our fields a , b and c , and associate it with gas compression by the expanding hii  region and sequential star formation in ngc  604 .",
    "the center of field a is , in projection , about @xmath117 ( or 20  pc ) away from the peak of co emission first reported in @xcite and confirmed to be a dense molecular cloud in @xcite , although given the extension of this cloud ( about 30  pc ) , we can consider it as coincident with field a. we can not confirm a physical association of the molecular cloud with our infrared sources , since we only see a projected spatial association .",
    "however , based on our results and the mentioned previous work , it becomes evident that both dense , molecular gas as well as warm molecular hydrogen is detected in the line of sight towards field a.      the 17  @xmath14  pah feature is generally associated with out - of - band bending modes of large pah molecules , containing @xmath155 c - atoms @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : pah_ratios ] shows that the relative strength of this feature exhibits an increasing trend with the x - ray flux .",
    "if we adopt the pah size argument , this implies that it is the ratio of large to small pah molecules that scales with the x - ray field .",
    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : soft_x ] shows that source 3 , which shows the largest enhancement of the 17  @xmath14  pah feature among our sources , coincides in projection with a peak of soft x - ray emission .",
    "soft x - ray emission from massive stars can be associated with shocked stellar winds or magnetically confined gas near the wind base , near the stellar coronae @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of pah molecules by x - rays has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "they argue that not all x - ray photon absorptions by pah molecules lead to photodissociation and estimate that after a second electron has been ejected by the pah molecule via the auger effect , the molecule is left with an internal energy of 14 - 35  ev , enough to dissociate small ( 50 c - atoms ) pahs , but possibly insufficient to dissociate larger molecules .",
    "they leave the question of large pah survival open .",
    "our observations suggest that , at least in the particular case of source 3 , x - ray emission from massive stars may be responsible for the dissociation of small pah molecules , creating an enhancement of the 17  @xmath14  feature .",
    "similar relative enhancements of the 17  @xmath14  feature have been observed in regions of hard radiation fields in galaxies , such as the vicinity of agns @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that a myso candidate has been identified by @xcite less than @xmath156 away from source 3 .",
    "also , @xcite report the presence of at least 2 red supergiants ( rsgs ) coincident with the location of this source .",
    "if other rsgs have already exploded as supernovae near this location , this could provide part of the x - ray enhancement observed .",
    "the red contours correspond to the acis image .",
    "source 3 coincides with a local peak of soft x - ray emission with a flux of @xmath157 ( see table [ tab : pah_ratios ] ) . ]",
    "[ fig : si_ii_pah ] is suggestive of a correlation between the enhancement of [ siii ] and the enhancement of 17  @xmath14  pah emission at scales of tens of parsecs . despite the relatively large uncertainties in both the pah ratio and the [ siii]/[neii ] ratio , the figure indicates clearly that the enhancement of the pah 17  @xmath14  feature scales with the relative strength of the [ siii ] emission , with the exception of source 5 , which lies outside this correlation .",
    "this result suggests a common underlying physical mechanism for the enhancement of both features .",
    "we have shown in table [ tab : pah_ratios ] that the regions of strongest 17  @xmath14  pah emission also correspond to regions of enhanced x - ray emission .",
    "based on the triple correlation between pah@xmath61 emission , [ siii ] emission , and soft x - ray flux , we argue that absorption of ambient x - rays may be linked to both the destruction of small pah molecules and the excitation of [ siii ] , and produces the correlation observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : si_ii_pah ] .",
    "as we have pointed out , source 5 is an outlier of this correlation : it shows a relatively large [ siii]/[neii ] ratio , but very moderate pah@xmath158 ratio .",
    "it also lies in a region of low x - ray flux , near the edge between the western , active star - forming hemisphere of ngc  604 and the quiescent eastern region where most of the wolf - rayet stars are located @xcite .",
    "in fact it coincides with the location of one of these wr stars @xcite . in this part of ngc  604 ,",
    "the relatively high x - ray luminosity is most likely powered by the shocked gas resulting from older dynamical processes .",
    "based on these facts , we speculate that the [ siii]/[neii ] ratio for this source is enhanced due to the presence of shocked gas rather than x - ray induced .",
    "although no supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been identified in the eastern hemisphere , this is not surprising , since such objects expanding into a low - density gas are hard to detect @xcite .",
    "several authors have gathered evidence that suggest the presence of ongoing star formation in ngc  604 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , none of these authors have provided spectroscopic confirmation for such very recent star formation activity in the region .",

    "[ fig : itera ] that the line ratios measured towards these clumps , are consistent with ages of between 4  myr and 4.5  myr .",
    "although the timescales for the dissipation of dusty envelopes around star - forming clusters can be as long as 10  myr in regions of high density , the low electron density that we have inferred in  [ sec : e_density ] implies that ngc  604 is a rather diffuse region .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that our infrared clumps are evolved clusters .",
    "the presence of these young , massive , ir - bright clusters , some of which have deep silicate absorption features , is a clear indication of significant massive star formation currently taking place in ngc  604 .",

    "[ fig : best_fit_int ] ) arises from myso ( that in the d&g frame we model as ultra compact hii  regions ) , and corresponds to dust temperatures of about 300  k. although the required fraction of mass in embedded objects is considerably smaller than that derived for 30 doradus in mg11 , it suggests the presence of a considerable amount of embedded star formation in the region .",
    "the total embedded mass derived is in fact comparable to the sum up of the individual clump masses , and equals approximately 8% of the total cluster mass , as can be calculated from table [ tab : results_int ] .    in an evolutionary context ,",
