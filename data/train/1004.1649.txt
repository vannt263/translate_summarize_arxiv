    "the framework was developed during an mcnet 4-months project at university college london .",
    "subsequently further development took place in tel aviv university .",
    "this paper discusses the first proof - of - concept version .",
    "the code has been developed in c++ using standard gnu development tools running on scientific linux .",
    "it requires the packages root@xcite , lhapdf@xcite , heppdt@xcite and pythia8 to be accessible .",
    "this paper contains two parts : _ ( a ) _ the development of the validation processes , and _",
    "( b ) _ the specific implementation of the kk process and the corresponding analysis of the events at the generator level .",
    "the lhc is expected to be ready for colliding beams at the end of 2009 .",
    "it is designed to collide proton beams at 14 tev , the highest cm energy ever reached in a laboratory .",
    "it will greatly enlarge the kinematic region for the search for physics phenomena beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "several bsm theories predict the existence of other dimensions in addition to the usual three spatial and one time dimension .",
    "these models allow various particles to propagate into the extra - dimensional bulk .",
    "the tev@xmath5 ed model considered here allows the kk modes of @xmath6 gauge fields to propagate into the extra - dimensional bulk while restricting all the matter fermions and the @xmath2 gauge fields to be localized in the usual 3@xmath7 brane  @xcite .",
    "one objective of the lhc program in the context of these models is to search for a signal of the first excited kk mode of the @xmath0 gauge fields , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a popular model that does not involve extra dimensions is also considered for comparison .",
    "an extra heavy boson arising from the breaking of the @xmath10 group  @xcite is assumed .",
    "the signal of this extra heavy boson , denoted by @xmath11 , can demonstrate similar characteristics to the kk signal for which a technique to distinguish between the two models is required .",
    "another popular possibility that is * not * considered in this paper is the rs  @xcite model that predicts the existence of kaluza - klein spin-2 gravitons , denoted by @xmath12 . in some models , the mass of first kk graviton excitation can be the same as the mass of the spin-1 @xmath13 or @xmath11 , and therefore , there is a need to identify the @xmath12 signature and especially its spin .    in this paper , the signature of the first two cases",
    "is studied where the produced bosonic candidates from either the standard model ( sm ) @xmath4 bosons , the heavy kk @xmath13 bosons , or the extra bosons @xmath11 , decay all into charged leptons .",
    "this kk model is particularly interesting because of the strong destructive interference that manifests itself at much lower invariant masses comparing to the resonance itself . in this model",
    "this will always occur for masses around half of the resonance mass .",
    "for example , with a resonance at 4  tev , this will occur around 2  tev .",
    "therefore , at the lhc , the suppression of the cross section can be observed much earlier than the resonance itself .",
    "this will not happen for the various @xmath11 possible signals that go along with the sm z - line shape up to masses near the @xmath11 resonance  @xcite .",
    "powerful methods to quantify the sensitivity for bsm physics at the @xmath141 tev scale are presented . for an observed resonance above a small sm background around @xmath144 tev",
    ", a measurement of the charged lepton kinematic distributions can provide the discrimination between the two spin-1 bsm models presented in this paper .",
    "the sensitivity for this discrimination depends on the lhc luminosity and the collisions energy , and it should be possible already with an integrated luminosity of @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 by applying the kolmogorov test on the invariant mass and the angular distributions . this measurement can also quantify some interesting physical aspects of the new models and support the discrimination between them to some extent .",
    "the main observable that is extracted , in this context , is the forward backward asymmetry asymmetry where the kk behave similar to the sm .",
    "] of the angular distributions .",
    "although it is * not * shown here , this measurement can enable the classification of the resonance as spin-1 or , for instance , spin-2 to some extent .",
    "further consistent experimental studies on @xmath11 , @xmath13 and the @xmath12 possible signals in the lhc can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "many processes are implemented in standard event generators , however , there are numerous specific bsm processes which are not modeled .",
    "this framework can be used to integrate various new bsm processes with the standard event generator pythia8 .",
    "new processes can of course be directly implemented in pythia8 where there is a special interface class to that job . in some cases it is natural and convenient to integrate the new model . in other cases",
    ", it may turn out to be more complex . in that light",
    ", the framework has some advantages .",
    "it allows , for instance , to utilize the interfaces with the standard heppdt , lhapdf and root tools . in addition , the structure enables to form new independent modules that assemble the new model , as it was originally built to allow programming of complicated models with several non - standard aspects like the kk model . in the new bsm models , we include new models where two initial state particles interact and create a maximum of three final state particles , _ ie _ , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 hard - processes described by a differential cross - section function , as these are the constraints introduced by pythia8 . within , these processes ( cross - section functions )",
    "can be both analyzed independently and interfaced with pythia8 to generate the corresponding fully simulated physics events .",
    "pythia8 , the new generation of the commonly used event generators , pythia , is a powerful and convenient tool . of the most important feature in this context ,",
    "is the care that has been taken to allow user supplied hard subprocesses to be quickly and fully integrated into the pythia8 framework .",
    "this was the reason the framework was developed on top of pythia8 , and will be enhanced with more interfaces and examples in the future .",
    "it is suggested that introducing new processes will be forehanded by a validation procedure using analogous processes .",
    "since the presented kk implementation has many common characteristics with the corresponding sm implementation , a validation procedure was adopted .",
    "the internal pythia8 sm process was reproduced as a user process but while adjusting the helicity - amplitude formalism intended for the kk scenario .",
    "the helicity amplitude was sent to pythia8 using its standard interface class .",
    "the @xmath19 interface was used although it is also possible to utilize the @xmath16 production and subsequent @xmath20 decay .",
    "the externally generated events were then compared with those from the self internal implementation subprocesses of pythia8 . throughout the following sections ,",
    "the `` external / internal processes '' nomenclature will be used in this context . throughout the presented work the mrst2001lo parton distribution set  @xcite was used .",
    "in the following section two methodical case studies are presented to validate the implementation of the external processes against pythia8 s internal processes ; _ ( a ) _ the sm @xmath21 at low energies where the contribution of the @xmath22 boson is negligible and _ ( b ) _ the sm @xmath23 at higher energies where the contribution of the @xmath22 is dominant .",
    "apart from the validation objective of these two examples , it is worthwhile going through these cases in some detail since it will also serve to rigorously explain the formalism used in the remainder of this paper .      in this case",
    "the pythia8 output of the estimated total cross section values using the external implementation and using pythia8 s internal scheme are compared . the integrated total cross section @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , can be realized by averaging the differential cross section over all the incoming helicity states , ( corresponding to an unpolarized beam ) , by summing over all the outgoing helicity states , ( corresponding to an unmeasured final polarization state ) and by integrating over the solid angle @xmath29 .",
    "the differential cross section itself in terms of the helicity of the incoming electron @xmath30 and the helicity of the outgoing muon @xmath31 is @xmath32 where , @xmath33 is the collision s cm energy , the quantities @xmath34 @xmath35 are the charges ( in units of the proton charge ) of the leptons , see the corresponding tree - level diagram in fig  [ fig : schannelphoton ] .",

    ", it is sufficient to sum only over the helicity states of the incoming electron and the outgoing muon .",
    "finally , the polar angle @xmath42 is the angle of the outgoing @xmath39 relative to the incoming @xmath37 ( with the azimuthal angle @xmath43 , distributed uniformly ) . if one is to use the differential cross section from eq  [ eq : sigmalep_diffr ] in the @xmath19 interface class of pythia8 , it is expected to be given in the mandelstam variable @xmath44 related to @xmath45 as @xmath46 the transformation introduces an extra @xmath47 factor in the cross section .",
    "note that by doing so , the differential cross section is now dimensionally different than the previous by @xmath48 and therefore has the units of gev@xmath49 , as required by pythia8 , @xmath50 after integrating over the azimuthal angle @xmath43 , the correct function given to pythia8 is @xmath51    one can use eq  [ eq : sigmalep_diffr_full ] to generate events with low cm ( cm ) energy  at 20 gev , far enough below the @xmath22 pole . in this case",
    "it acceptable to ignore at the first approximation the @xmath22 contribution .",
    "all parton - level switches are turned off so the events are generated up to the level of the hard - process ( _ ie _ , no parton showering , hadronization , kinematic cuts , etc . )    for comparison , the generation of the hard - subprocess is performed using the above but also repeated with the same run conditions and with the same sample size of 1 m events but simply calling the internal process .",
    "in fact , in pythia8 this is usually performed in two steps ; the @xmath52 production and then the @xmath53 decay .",
    "however , the statistical error involved in the @xmath52 production is very small since the angle is already integrated out and therefore , all phase space points will be the same and evaluate to the same value .",
    "therefore , the error which is subjected to roundoff errors , is unrealistic small and can be ignored .",
    "for this reason , there s also a less familiar @xmath19 implementation ( in pythia8 ) which was chosen for comparison since in this way one can get different cross sections depending on the angle selected on event by event basis and that leads to different event weights , which implies a realistic statistical error but also a lower efficiency .",
    "the @xmath19 pythia8 internal implementation had to be slightly modified to fix the final state at @xmath54 .",
    "the external function ( see eq  [ eq : sigmalep_diffr_full ] ) describes the same process and was implemented as a @xmath19 with the intermediate photon included explicitly in it .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : totalsigma_e+e - mu+mu- ] where the agreement between these two values is to within @xmath141-sigma .",
    "._cross section statistics as given by pythia8 for the two 1 m samples ( internal & external ) of @xmath21 events at 20 gev cm energy .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : mhatkolmogorov ]    in light of the results seen in tables  [ table : angularkolmogorov ] and  [ table : mhatkolmogorov ] , it should be mentioned that a binned kolmogorov test can provide better results ( _ ie _ , the models will be more self - compatible and less inter - compatible ) , depending on the arbitrary choice of the binning .      1",
    ".   looking at table  [ table : angularfit ] and comparing the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 around the expected resonance , it can be concluded that : * based on the fit results for the @xmath57 coefficients , for the three models ( in the cs @xmath58 frame ) , they turn out to be consistent with zero . * at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 , the values of @xmath59 for the three models are compatible with their mc reference estimations within less than one sigma . * at @xmath15=500 fb@xmath5 , the values of @xmath59 for the sm and the @xmath60 models are compatible with their mc reference estimations within less than one sigma , where the kk model is compatible only within 2.3 sigma . *",
    "the errors for @xmath59 in both luminosities are too high .",
    "hence , the sensitivity for probing the couplings using the measured @xmath59 coefficients requires larger samples .",
    "2 .   from the unbinned kolmogorov tests in table  [ table : angularkolmogorov ] for the @xmath61 distributions",
    ", it can be concluded that : * there is clear distinction between the kk model ( pseudo - data ) and the @xmath60 model ( mc ref ) at @xmath15=500 fb@xmath5 as well as at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 .",
    "* the @xmath60 model ( pseudo - data ) and the kk model ( mc ref ) are compatible at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 . however , the kk pseudo - data represents better its mc ref. 3 .   from the unbinned kolmogorov tests in table  [ table : mhatkolmogorov ] for the @xmath62 distributions",
    ", it can be concluded that : * as expected , there is a clear compatibility between all three models ( pseudo - data ) to the data simulated with the equivalent at @xmath15=500 fb@xmath5 and even at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 except for the @xmath60 model at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 which is very small ( @xmath140.016 ) * there is a significant distinction between the kk model and the @xmath60 model at both luminosity values .",
    "the important conclusion is that assuming an observed spin-1 resonance at @xmath63 4 tev , above the sm background , it will be possible to distinguish between the kk and @xmath64 models based on the kolmogorov test for the @xmath62 distributions , already at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 . for the @xmath61 distributions , the kolmogorov test and the ml fit for the forward - backward asymmetry measurement can be very important in providing supportive information for such a discrimination .",
    "this conclusion is valid already at @xmath15=100 fb@xmath5 but it is much stronger for @xmath15=500 fb@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , it is clear that for both luminosities , the measurement of @xmath59 is too coarse for placing a precision statement about the new exotic couplings and it is only at higher integrated luminosities where a more sensitive study can be performed .",
    "in this paper the scenario of an observed resonance around 4  tev , arising from the measurement of di - muon events is discussed .",
    "it is shown that for the lhc , it will be possible to discriminate between the specific kk model and the @xmath64 model described in this paper assuming collisions in the design energy @xmath65  tev and assuming integrated luminosity of @xmath15=100  fb@xmath5 .",
    "this statement relies both on the measurement of the @xmath62 and @xmath61 distributions and the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry , applying as few cuts as necessary to deal with isr .",
    "one should keep in mind that this conclusion can not be complete without passing the generated events through the full @xmath66 detector simulation . in that context , it should also be commented that :    * it is mandatory to apply a full detector simulation in order to treat the kolmogorov unbinned ( single ) test as a single experiment .",
    "furthermore , one needs to repeat these experiments with large number of generated pseudo - data samples to quantify the sensitivity of the test . *",
    "the comparison should also be done with a spin-2 model ( namely , the rs graviton ) . in that context , the azimuthal angle distribution can be used as well@xcite . *",
    "a measurement of both di - muon and di - electron events will double the statistics shown here .",
    "* since the number of events is linear to the integrated luminosity , then it is clear that a sample much smaller than @xmath15=100  fb@xmath5 will not be sufficient for any discrimination .",
    "* in the first year of the lhc operation , it is expected that the collisions will take place at @xmath677 - 10  tev cm energy and the luminosity is not expected to exceed 0.2 - 0.3  fb@xmath5 . in this case",
    "it will not be possible to discover in the first year a resonance at 4  tev related to any of the models discussed in this paper .",
    "* for the possibility of no observed resonance below the current lower bound on @xmath68 ( @xmath144  tev for kk ) , one should be able to place a new lower bound on its mass as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "* finally , the unique behavior of the invariant mass distribution of the kk model below the resonance may provide hints for the existence of such a resonance even if it is beyond the lhc reach .    the preliminary analysis presented here",
    "is based on results from the combination of pythia8 and the new software .",
    "the specific kaluza - klein model is now implemented in . as declared , this is the first phase towards integration inside pythia8 as an internal process .",
    "other plans include interfacing this generator to the @xmath66 detector simulation software for continuing the systematic analysis , generalize and re - order this framework as can be expected from the next releases and , enhance this framework with more bsm processes .",

    "to demonstrate in practice the origin of the so called kk tower and the mass relation to the size of the parallel ed , @xmath74 , we can start by thinking of a toy model where we have a massless scalar field in flat @xmath75 space - time .",
    "the metric tensor is @xmath76 , assuming a space - like ed where we denote the ed coordinate by @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the regular four - coordinate  @xcite .",
    "first , we assume that the field @xmath79 satisfies the @xmath75 klein - gordon ( kg ) equation @xmath80 a second assumption , followed from the form of the kg equation , is to separate the dependencies ( of the @xmath78 and @xmath77 coordinates ) and take @xmath81 .",
    "the next assumption is that @xmath82 satisfies the equation @xmath83 we also assume the orthogonality of the different @xmath77 dependent parts _ ie _ , @xmath84 and finally , we write the @xmath75 action of the field with the boundary conditions ( bc ) taken to be @xmath85_{z_1}^{z_2 } = 0 $ ] @xmath86 + by integrating over the extra coordinate @xmath77 , we reduce the @xmath75 action to an effective @xmath87 one @xmath88 } } \\label{eq:4daction}\\ ] ] this action can be simply understood as the sum of distinct actions of @xmath87 scalar fields @xmath89 with different masses labeled by the integer index @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , the various masses we observe in @xmath87 correspond to quantized values of the momentum along the extra coordinate @xmath77 since @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the `` observed '' mass in @xmath87 .",
    "the quantized momentum in the ed is @xmath93 so by using eq  [ eq:5thcoordinatefunction ] we see that @xmath94 where it is more appropriate to identify also the mass in @xmath87 with the integer index @xmath95 . the last term is often called the kk tower of excitations .",
    "this is a striking result since we obtained a mass property in @xmath87 by starting from a flat , @xmath75 space - time with a massless field . yet",
    ", this does nt explain the origin of the mass relation to the size of the extra dimension @xmath74 . to obtain this relation ,",
    "we have to look at the specific ed topology and the bc . looking on eq  [ eq:5thcoordinatefunction ] , we can expand @xmath82 in exponential wave - eigenfunctions @xmath96 where @xmath97 are constants . if we postulate",
    "that the ed is compact such that it is curled into a one - dimensional sphere @xmath98 of radius @xmath74 then the specific translation invariance @xmath99 of @xmath82 implies that the bc are periodical _ ie _",
    ", @xmath100 therefore , eq  [ eq : m4dm5dmn ] translates to @xmath101 where we see that the massless mode does exist as required , _ ie _ , @xmath102 .",
    "however , in eq  [ eq : kk_mass ] we saw that the mass we observe in @xmath87 consists of the kk excited term @xmath103 but also from another fixed term @xmath104 which is identified as the @xmath87 state .",
    "we know that this term can be non - zero and that it is the higgs mechanism which is responsible for creating the @xmath87 mass @xmath104 .",
