    "there is evidence of an earlier flare on ojd  41.11 , with a maximum observed flux density of 366  mjy , but only the rising portion of the flare is observed , so its properties are poorly - constrained . as is shown in figure",

    "they show the recovery of the hard x - ray flux , subject to orbital modulation .",
    "the modulation makes it difficult to determine the significance of the drop in flux seen in the last three measurements ; it may be evidence of a significant reduction in hard x - ray emission precursing the radio flare .",
    "combining the _ swift_/bat and _ integral _  measurements , the hard x - ray flux has recovered by ojd  @xmath142.0 , about 5  h before the observed radio flare .",

    "if our observations are taken at face value  that is , one assumes no significant radio activity during coverage gaps and that the flaring stems from one ejection event  the sequencing of the radio and @xmath0-ray emission  is inconsistent with the companion ic model discussed in ",
    "[ s : intro ] .",
    "emission in @xmath0-rays  following a radio flare could be interpreted as a reenergization of the relativistic jet electrons by a shock @xcite . with a typical jet speed of @xmath10.5  @xmath21 @xcite and a delay of @xmath11  d",
    ", the reenergization would occur @xmath1100  au from the system .",
    "this is much larger than the orbital separation but three orders of magnitude smaller than the distance at which the jet is expected to interact significantly with the ism ( @xmath11  pc ) .",
    "such reenergization could be due to a collision between the jet and a dense clump of the wr wind @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the absence of @xmath0-ray emission  at the time of ejection can be explained by absorption within the system @xcite , although this model must be reconciled with the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reenergization would lead to additional radio emission as the @xmath0-ray - emitting electrons cool , although the ambient magnetic field , and hence synchrotron luminosity , will be much weaker than that found close to the system .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray  flare is interpreted as the result of a discrete ejection event , the lack of a notable subsequent radio flare could be explained by the ejected material being largely hadronic . while hadronic @xmath0-ray emission  is not as efficient as ic upscattering , it does yield a higher ratio of @xmath0-ray  to radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "the secondary leptons due to hadronic interactions would , however , radiate , and detailed studies typically find that their bolometric luminosity is comparable to that of the primaries ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    should our data be taken at face value ?",
    "application of a simple synchrotron - cloud model @xcite supports the intuition that radio flares with sizes comparable to that of the largest observed could have occurred without detection , with the modeled lifetimes being @xmath10.2  d. while this model has had ambiguous success when applied to  @xcite , its simplicity is advantageous for our sparse data , and it has been successfully applied to observations of other systems ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to obtain a better understanding of the radio behavior of  we compared the",
    "2010  may data to 15 years of archived ami - la / ryle telescope observations .",
    "the @xmath11  jy radio flare is unusual : no flux densities @xmath22  mjy are detected in a 500  d span around the observations we describe .    in light of the predictions of the companion ic model ,",
    "we consider particularly the radio observations after the observed @xmath0-ray  flare .",
    "the duty cycle of the observations is only 6.8% in the seven - day post - flare quiescent interval .",
    "we identified 51 epochs similar to this in the archives , each lasting at least 7 days and having an 80@xmath19-percentile observed flux less than 70  mjy ( cf . ",
    "[ s : results ] ) .",
    "these archival measurements have a duty cycle comparable to that of the 2010  may data ( 4.9% ) , but a much larger time on - source ( 55.5 days ) .",
    "because this time is large compared to the total duration of the 2010  may post-@xmath0-flare quiescence , a search for flares in the archival dataset can constrain the likelihood of there having been an unobserved flare in the 2010  may dataset , assuming no long - term evolution in the behavior of the quiescent state and stochastic flaring .",
    "the epochs were identified by exhaustively searching for seven - day segments meeting the aforementioned criteria , then lengthening these segments as much as possible without violating the 80@xmath19-percentile constraint .",
    "segments separated by less than three days were merged , in a few cases shortening the segment somewhat to preserve the statistical constraint .",
    "this method of construction does not bias against epochs containing rapid flares , no matter their size .",
    "qualitatively , the lightcurve of the typical epoch starts high , drops to very low flux densities , and then becomes high again , possibly with rapid flares in the middle .",
    "the largest flux density seen in the selected archival data was 524  mjy , in the context of a single rapidly - evolving ( risetime @xmath10.1  d ) flare that would not have necessarily been detected in the 2010  may observing .",
    "( here we exclude slow , large , epoch - terminating flares that would have been easily seen in the 2010  may data . ) approximating the rate of such flares as one per 55.5 days of observing , we derive an 11% chance that such a flare occurred in the 7 days after the gamma - ray peak without being observed . ignoring the epoch beginnings and endings , which contain high flux values by construction",
    ", we find that the flux density of  is larger than 250  mjy only 0.3% of the time during its quiescent state .",
    "we have presented observations of a 2010  may  flaring episode in the radio , soft and hard x - ray , and @xmath0-ray  bands .",
    "our data show a sequence of three notable events : a particular softening and partial recovery of the x - ray emission , a rapid @xmath11  jy radio flare , and a @xmath0-ray  flare .",
    "interpretation of the data is made more challenging by the sparse sampling of the radio data and the low cadence of the high - energy observations as compared to the rapidity with which the radio emission can evolve .",
    "nonetheless , the observations we do have and comparisons to historical data challenge the interpretation that the @xmath0-ray emission  is due to ic upscattering of the companion radiation field by high - energy electrons leaving the system in a relativistic jet , because there is no evidence for the subsequent radio emission that one would expect to see from these electrons .    while the companion ic model of @xmath0-ray emission  from microquasars is clear and compelling , the lack of consistent radio/@xmath0-ray  timing lags call into question its completeness .",
    "there could be more than one mechanism responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission  of , becoming more or less relevant in different circumstances , or the reprocessing of the @xmath0-ray emission  by effects such as pair production could be more significant than commonly assumed .",
    "detections of or limits to very high - energy @xmath0-rays  ( @xmath11100  gev ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or neutrinos from  would aid in the understanding of the processes relevant to the emission in the _ fermi _  band .    the power of multiband monitoring of  promises to increase significantly with the addition of @xmath0-ray  data to the set of available observations .",
    "as  inevitably produces more flares , frequent observations at all wavelengths are important to build a detailed understanding of the launching and propagation of its relativistic jets .",
    "radio observations of @xmath92  h cadence with near - continuous coverage would be ideal for establishing an unambiguous relationship between radio and @xmath0-ray  flaring .",
    "based on the phenomenology we observe , intensive radio observations should be triggered at the ends of very soft x - ray states without waiting for the detection of @xmath0-ray  flares .",
