    "in quantum information theory entanglement between parts of a system has been identified as the key resource that can possibly make quantum information processing more powerful than classical information processing .",
    "entanglement can also be a resource for long - distance quantum communication or distributed quantum computation , and it is at the heart of some quantum communication protocols .",
    "but entanglement is fragile under the influence of environment induced decoherence .",
    "all engineering hence thrives to better control and manipulate the quantum information stored in the system while keeping the detrimental effects of decoherence low .    in nature ,",
    "on the other hand , we mostly find less controllable systems , especially if the system size becomes macroscopic as in gases , fluids , solids or even biological systems .",
    "since these systems are usually open , noisy systems at possibly high temperatures one expects that environment induced decoherence will erase all entanglement between system degrees of freedom .",
    "this reasoning is true except for three cases .",
    "first , the environment and its coupling to the system could be special in a way that it creates rather than destroys entanglement . however , it is unlikely to find such an environment in nature where usually thermalization dominates , and we will only briefly touch upon the subject of such environments in this paper .",
    "second , if the system has an entangled ground state , as many solid state systems do , its thermal state will be entangled in a certain temperature range above zero by a continuity argument .",
    "coupling to a heat bath drives a system into its thermal state .",
    "but there is a temperature threshold for the bath above which the thermal state will be unentangled .",
    "third , the system might have a built - in entropy drain , meaning that the correlations with the environment are , by one way or another , erased such that the system can re - build entanglement through its quantum mechanical interactions .",
    "this entropy drain may even be local to exclude the trivial cases where entanglement is simply  pumped \" into the system , e.g. , by injecting fresh , entangled bell pairs .    in  @xcite we proposed such a local entropy drain in form of a reset mechanism , where system particles are randomly replaced by particles in some standard , mixed state of sufficiently low entropy .",
    "note that such a mechanism can not create entanglement , on the contrary , it erases any entanglement that might still be present between the particle that is reset and the rest of the system . only the interplay with the system hamiltonian can lead to entanglement in a steady state that is possibly far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this reset mechanism was studied for a toy model with two qubits , where analytic solutions could be obtained .",
    "also a multipartite scenario for a ( simplified ) gas model was discussed , and further generalizations were suggested . by gas - type systems we mean systems in which the decoherence processes act locally on the system particles , by strongly coupled systems we mean those where the decoherence processes act globally . to be more precise , local decoherence processes are those , which induce transitions between the eigenstates of the local , free hamiltonian alone , while global decoherence processes induce transitions between eigenstates of the total hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    "we review the key idea of a reset mechanism but provide more in - depth material than in  @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on the generalizations suggested in  @xcite , namely on the influence of local entropy drains on the dynamics of entanglement and on the steady - state entanglement in gas - type systems as well as in strongly coupled systems .",
    "we prove that the master equation describing the evolution of the system coupled to a heat bath and subject to a reset mechanism is of lindblad form and hence generates a completely positive , i.e. , physical map .",
    "we analytically solve the master equation for small systems of two spins with special interaction hamiltonians , which enables us to illustrate the main features of the reset mechanism .",
    "in particular we show the following .    1 .",
    "steady - state entanglement in systems with reset mechanism is different from the entanglement in thermal states .",
    "2 .   in strongly coupled systems with constant coupling steady - state entanglement with reset can exist for higher temperatures than the entanglement in the thermal state , which is the steady state without reset .",
    "3 .   in gas - type systems",
    "steady - state entanglement with reset can exist even for arbitrary temperatures .",
    "these features are not due to the specially chosen interaction hamiltonians and decoherence processes .",
    "we demonstrate that the above properties are almost independent of both .",
    "one can also relax the conditions on the reset states and take mixed states with sufficiently low entropy instead of pure states .",
    "finally , a generalization to larger system sizes , possibly even with fluctuating particle numbers , still leads to similar results .",
    "hence , the reset mechanism is at the same time simple and generic .",
    "we remark that in cavity qed an incoherent generation of entanglement has been proposed , which bears resemblance to our work  @xcite .",
    "there , an atom couples to two leaky optical cavities and is driven by a white noise field .",
    "this incoherent driving can , when the atom is finally traced out , result in entanglement between the cavity modes",
    ". entanglement is generated for intermediate cavity damping rates and intensities of the noise field , an effect labeled `` stochastic resonance '' in  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this effect is more correctly interpreted as an example for a reset mechanism . in a subsequent work",
    "@xcite strongly related to  @xcite , one single cavity entangles two atoms , giving yet another example for a reset mechanism even closer to the setups of this paper .",
    "the reset mechanism is certainly not a preferred way to actively protect entanglement and mostly can not even be compared to such strategies , but , because of its simplicity and generality , there is hope that such a mechanism may ultimately be identified in natural processes leading to an increased understanding whether entanglement can play a role in systems at high temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first concentrate on simple models with only two particles ( qubits ) . in section  [ gasmodel ]",
    "we motivate the description by a master equation , explain in which cases the model is valid , and study several specific hamiltonians and noise channels analytically and others numerically .",
    "we also compare entangled steady states resulting from a reset mechanism to entangled steady states resulting from special choices of interaction hamiltonian and decoherence process .",
    "we show in section  [ stronglycoupledmodel ] that we can find the same features in strongly coupled systems , and we give the conditions to be met by the reset mechanism such that entangled steady states can exist . then , in section  [ multipartite ] , we extend the model to include more qubits and discuss the meaning of different kinds of entanglement that we use .",
    "finally we give a summary of the results in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this chapter we discuss a toy model with only two particles , which we take as spin-@xmath0 systems or qubits for simplicity .",
    "the toy model shows all the features that we will later find in larger systems and it has the advantage that we can show many results analytically leading to an increased understanding of the involved processes .",
    "we will formulate the equations for an arbitrary number @xmath1 of qubits , so that we can refer to them later in section  [ multipartite ] .      in a gas particles",
    "are weakly coupled in the sense that most of the time they do not considerably interact with each other unless they collide . in the meantime",
    "they only feel their local , free hamiltonian and are subject to individual , local decoherence processes , e.g. through interactions with thermal photons ( radiative damping ) . if we pick a subset consisting of @xmath1 gas particles and consider these as the system , collisions with the remaining gas particles are another source of decoherence ( non - radiative damping or dephasing ) . in a master equation that models this gas - type system",
    "we replace the original , time - dependent collision hamiltonian by an averaged , time - independent interaction hamiltonian .",
    "since the interaction hamiltonian does not modify the energy landscape in this model , the local , radiative decoherence processes tend to drive the system to the thermal state of the free hamiltonian , for which we choose the form @xmath2 we leave the interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 unspecified for the moment . for two qubits",
    ", we will often use the ising hamiltonian @xmath4 for analytic discussions , whereas more complicated hamiltonians will be treated numerically .",
    "we write the total hamiltonian as @xmath5 such that the master equation is @xmath6+{\\cal l}_{\\rm{noise}}\\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a liouville operator representing the noise channels .",
    "we describe the noise channels by the lindblad operator  @xcite @xmath8\\nonumber\\\\ -\\frac{b}{2 } s[\\sigma_-^{(i)}\\sigma_+^{(i)}\\rho+\\rho\\sigma_-^{(i)}\\sigma_+^{(i)}-2\\sigma_+^{(i)}\\rho\\sigma_-^{(i)}]-\\frac{2c - b}{4}[\\rho-\\sigma_z^{(i)}\\rho\\sigma_z^{(i)}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and the @xmath10s are pauli operators .",
    "parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 give the decay rate of inversion @xmath13 and polarization @xmath14 under the action of @xmath7 , and @xmath15 $ ] depends on temperature , where @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath17 ( we set the boltzmann and planck constant equal to one ) .",
    "the definition of @xmath18 stems from laser physics where inversion occurs corresponding to  negative temperatures \" .",
    "many authors use @xmath19 instead of @xmath18 and @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 .",
    "then , no negative temperatures are possible .",
    "the noise channel is derived assuming certain approximations , e.g. the markov approximation .",
    "note , however , that this is not an essential assumption as we will demonstrate later in an example ( see figure  [ spingas ] and related text ) .",
    "an important special case of  ( [ localnoise ] ) , obtained by setting @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is the dephasing channel @xmath24,\\ ] ] well - known especially in its integrated form as a completely positive map @xmath25 with @xmath26 . as with the ising hamiltonian  ( [ isinghamiltonian ] )",
    ", we will often use the dephasing channel for analytic discussions because of its simplicity .",
    "we are interested in the steady state of this master equation for @xmath27 qubits and the question whether there is entanglement in this state . at this point we simply state the following results since we will later solve a more general master equation that contains equation  ( [ gasme ] ) as a special case .    as an easy example",
    "we start with the ising interaction hamiltonian  ( [ isinghamiltonian ] )",
    ". the steady state will be the tensor product of the thermal states of each free hamiltonian @xmath28 since this state commutes with @xmath29 and since dephasing noise does not change the diagonal elements of the density matrix . in conclusion",
    ", we have the unentangled steady state @xmath30    when can we hope to find an entangled steady state ? as we know",
    "the radiative decoherence processes drive the system into the thermal states of the free hamiltonian .",
    "if the interaction hamiltonian can entangle these states we may find an entangled steady state at least for low temperatures .",
    "as an example , consider an interaction hamiltonian @xmath31 while the other terms stay the same as in the example above .",
    "we set @xmath32 ( no non - dissipative processes ) .",
    "the steady - state density matrix is then    @xmath33    this density matrix can be entangled .",
    "we measure the entanglement between two sets of qubits by the negativity  @xcite , which is given with respect to a bipartition @xmath34-@xmath35 as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 means the partial transpose with respect to @xmath34 . for two qubits ,",
    "we omit the label @xmath34 since there is only one bipartition , and the negativity can assume values between zero ( separable state ) and @xmath0 ( maximally entangled state ) .",
    "the reason why we choose the negativity as a measure throughout the paper is that we will use a generalization thereof in the multipartite case where the generalization of other entanglement measures might be hard to compute .",
    "the negativity of the state above is @xmath38\\left(b^2 + 4 \\left(g^2+\\omega ^2\\right)\\right)^{-2}\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be larger than zero but will always vanish for high temperatures of the bath , @xmath39 ( see figure  [ sxsx ] )",
    ".     entanglement as measured by the negativity in the steady state of equation  ( [ gasme ] ) with interaction hamiltonian @xmath31 and free hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "the decoherence processes are given by equation  ( [ localnoise ] ) .",
    "we choose the decay rate of inversion , @xmath11 , as inverse unit timescale and the other parameters as @xmath41 ( no dephasing noise ) and @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 on one of the axes is also measured in units of @xmath11 , whereas @xmath18 is dimensionless.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we see that the steady state of the master equation  ( [ gasme ] ) can be entangled for specially chosen interaction hamiltonians , but only below a certain temperature threshold . furthermore , if the free , local hamiltonian is too strong , i.e. , @xmath44 dominates by far all other parameters , there is also no entanglement .",
    "this statement applies to other models involving the hamiltonian  ( [ atomichamiltonian ] ) as well , and , accordingly , @xmath44 should have the same order of magnitude as the other parameters .",
    "spin gases  @xcite are an example for such gas - type systems .",
    "a spin gas is a system of quantum spins with stochastic , time - dependent interactions .",
    "a physical model of a spin gas is a system of @xmath1 classically moving particles with additional , internal spin degrees of freedom . upon collision",
    ", these quantum degrees of freedom interact according to some specified hamiltonian . in  @xcite the interaction hamiltonians were chosen locally unitarily equivalent to the ising interaction leading to a description in terms of weighted graph states .",
    "hence , in such spin gases , classical kinematics drives the evolution of the quantum state , and also the decoherence of arbitrary probe systems put into the gas and subjected to interactions with it . in general , multiple non - consecutive collisions of particles are possible .",
    "the spin gas remembers its whole interaction history , and it provides a microscopic model with _ non - markovian decoherence_.    assume that we have two selected gas particles ( e.g. another species ) that we consider as the system , while the other gas particles act as the environment that induces decoherence when interacting with the system particles .",
    "the rare interactions between the two system particles happen only during the short times when they collide . in the longer times in between they",
    "are not coupled and subject to local decoherence processes , i.e. , interactions with the environment gas particles .",
    "the induced decoherence processes are equivalent to dephasing channels ( corresponding to @xmath45 in equation  ( [ localnoise ] ) ) . in such a situation ,",
    "any entanglement between the two qubits that may either have been present initially or have built up on a short time scale will eventually be destroyed by the interactions with the other gas particles  @xcite .",
    "+ _ the spin gas with reset mechanism _ + for the moment , we stick to the toy - model with only to selected gas particles .",
    "imagine now that the two particles can , at a certain rate , leave the box in which the gas is contained and are instantly replaced by fresh qubits that are in a standard mixed state with sufficiently low entropy . instead of a replacement of system particles",
    "one can equivalently picture a measurement of the particle and a subsequent preparation in this standard state .",
    "note that the last step need not be an active procedure but can , e.g. , result from a spontaneous decay to this state .",
    "we call both procedures a reset mechanism",
    ". certainly , by a reset , we did not introduce entanglement into the system always consisting of two qubits . on the contrary ,",
    "any entanglement that might have been present between the particle that has left the box and the one that is still inside leads to a description of the latter by a more mixed density matrix ( closer to the identity ) .",
    "but the advantage is that we have lowered the local entropy of the system since the new particle has no correlations with the environment .",
    "this new particle can then become entangled with the other one on short time scales .",
    "we said above that in a spin gas with zero rate of qubit exchange the steady state will not be entangled . for infinite exchange rate the system would always be in a pure ( or a standard separable ) state and",
    "there is also no entanglement .",
    "if , however , the rate at which the qubits leave the spin gas is in a certain intermediate parameter regime one can hope that there is entanglement in the system on average . here , averaging means taking the mean density matrix of many simulation runs .",
    "later , the solutions to master equations are assumed to resemble the evolution of such a mean density matrix and , for explanations of certain ( entanglement ) features , this picture will sometimes be invoked .",
    "note that there are also other ansatzes . in  @xcite",
    "the solution of the master equation represents a smoothed version of a single simulation run , where smoothing is achieved by a time - integration kernel .",
    "the solution of the master equation does then not follow the rapid changes of the single density matrix , but sees only the slower changes resolved by a so - called coarse - grained timescale , which is related to the support of the integration kernel .",
    "figure  [ spingas ] indeed shows entanglement in steady states in a simulation of a spin lattice gas with an ising - type interaction  @xcite .",
    "steady - state entanglement between two selected qubits as measured by the negativity in a spin lattice gas ( @xmath46 lattice , @xmath47 qubits ) .",
    "the probability that a particle is exchanged for a fresh one in one time step of the simulation is plotted on the horizontal axes .",
    "hence , the value @xmath48 corresponds to an infinite exchange rate .",
    "the special qubits interact @xmath49 times stronger with each other than with the @xmath50 qubits that form the environment , i.e. , as physical particles , they are e.g. of a different kind than the environment particles .",
    "the density matrices from which the negativity is derived were averaged over @xmath51 simulation runs .",
    "other parameters : initial distance between special qubits : @xmath48 , interaction phase picked up during a collision between them : @xmath52 ; interaction phase for interactions with environment spins : @xmath53 ; for details see  @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the above scenario with two qubits might seem a little artificial . however , if we extend the setup to systems with more qubits and allow fluctuating particle numbers we can drop the requirement that selected particles must be instantaneously replaced .",
    "we can regard the spin - gas particles that do not belong to the system as a  hot bath \" introducing decoherence and destroying entanglement in the system , and the source of qubits in standard states as a  cold bath \" that can counteract the effect of the hot bath and preserve entanglement in the steady state .",
    "the analogy with a cold bath has some limitations as we will point out in section  [ stronglycoupledmodel ] .",
    "we will deal with multipartite qubit systems in section  [ multipartite ] . for the moment",
    ", we will stick to the two qubit system , for which we can find a master equation that reflects the properties of the  cold bath \" and that we can solve analytically in certain cases .",
    "observe that the master equation will again incorporate the markov - assumption , whereas the spin gases are non - markovian systems  @xcite and also partly have non - local decoherence processes .",
    "the essential features on the other hand will be qualitatively the same in some parameter regimes of the spin gas , where these effects play a minor role .    in the next subsection ,",
    "our goal is to transfer the idea of a reset mechanism from the specific example of a spin gas to a description in form of a master equation , suitable for any spin system .",
    "compared to  ( [ gasme ] ) , the master equation that models a gas - type system with reset mechanism has an additional term @xmath54 , which we describe as follows . with some probability @xmath55 particle @xmath56 , @xmath57 , is reset during the time interval @xmath58 to some specific state @xmath59 .",
    "the other qubits are left in the state @xmath60 .",
    "the change in the density matrix during the time @xmath58 due to @xmath54 is @xmath61 .",
    "observe that the time interval must be longer than the timescale of any of the involved processes but short enough so that we can replace it by the time differential to obtain , for the rate of change @xmath62 , the following master equation : @xmath63+{\\cal l}_{noise}\\rho+\\sum_{i=1}^n r(|\\chi_i\\rangle\\langle\\chi_i|\\mbox{tr}_i\\rho-\\rho)\\ ] ]    before we proceed to discuss the solution of ( [ generalme ] ) let us establish that the problem is well - defined , i.e. , that the master equation leads to a completely positive map , which is true when the master equation is of lindblad form .",
    "for the noise part this is known , so we have to bother only about the reset part . since @xmath64 is local we have to show that each summand is of the form @xmath65+[\\sigma_m^{(j)},\\rho\\sigma_n^{(j)}])$ ] where the @xmath66s are pauli operators and @xmath67 must be positive ( semidefinite ) matrices .",
    "we expand @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the @xmath10-basis as @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we insert these expressions into @xmath54 and also into the lindblad - expression , collect the coefficients that belong to each @xmath10-matrix of @xmath68 using the scalar product , and compare the coefficients @xmath72 in each expression , which leads us to a simple linear system of equations for the @xmath73 . solving this system of linear equations we obtain @xmath74",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath67 are @xmath75 . since we assumed @xmath69 to be pure , we have @xmath76 and eigenvalues @xmath77 .",
    "we note that also a mixed reset state would be fine to ensure that the @xmath67 are positive semidefinite . because the sum of positive matrices is a positive matrix , and",
    "because we know that the noise terms also have positive @xmath78-matrices , we have shown that the master equation is of lindblad form and preserves the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "up to this point , we have modeled interacting , gas - type systems coupled to a noisy environment .",
    "we have described a toy model consisting of only two particles by a master equation and compared predictions about the entanglement properties of steady states to simulations with a spin gas as an example for such gas - type systems .",

    "we treat the multipartite case .",
    "for multipartite spin systems , we will show that the reset mechanism can create steady - state entanglement in a similar way .",
    "the parameter regions where this happens are comparable to the @xmath145-qubit case .",
    "the values of the negativity , or rather its generalization , the average negativity , stay almost constant with increasing system size .",
    "note , however , that larger systems could have larger negativities , so if we divide the actual ( constant ) negativity by the maximal possible negativity , then this quantity would go down for growing system size .",
    "we will also consider entanglement in reduced density matrices . since in a reduction from @xmath1 to , say , @xmath145 qubits the traced out @xmath222 qubits act as an additional noise source , it is not surprising that the parameter region where we find steady - state entanglement in the reduced systems shrinks with growing @xmath1 .",
    "if the number of particles fluctuates according to some distribution , our best description of a reduced density matrix is a mixture of reductions originating from different system sizes .",

    "then demonstrate the above features in both gas - type systems and strongly interacting systems .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the master equation for the gas - type system , equation  ( [ generalme ] ) to @xmath223 qubits .",
    "the relevance of the entanglement quantities we are going to use needs to be motivated , though .",
    "we turn once more to the example of a spin gas .",
    "imagine that the spin gas is in a box of volume @xmath224 .",
    "this box has one semi - permeable wall through which particles can leave the box , and another through which particles from a  cold reservoir \" can enter . by",
    " cold reservoir \" we mean that the quantum state of the particles in this reservoir is in some sufficiently pure standard state .",
    "the motional degrees of freedom of theses particles , on the other hand , are in thermal equilibrium with the outside environment just like the system particles in the box .",
    "assume that the density of the gas in the box is @xmath225 .",
    "then there are on average @xmath226 particles in the box .",
    "the distribution of the number of particles that are in the box is a poissonian @xmath227 .",
    "when we observe the spin gas after certain time intervals , which should be long enough such that the gas always reaches its equilibrium state , we sample the distribution and get information about the density matrices with a corresponding number @xmath228 of qubits .",
    "the density matrices we can reconstruct after we collected a certain , sufficient amount of information is close to the steady - state density matrix of the master equation for @xmath228 qubits .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement properties of the gas and we will look at different aspects of entanglement in the following .",
    "all these aspects of entanglement are quantified by measures that are based on the negativity or the average negativity .",
    "the average negativity @xmath229 is the negativity averaged over all possible bipartitions of the system  @xcite .",
    "non - zero average negativity ensures the presence of some form of entanglement in the system .    specifically , we study three types of entanglement :    1 .",
    "the average negativity of the density matrices with @xmath228 qubits , averaged over the poissonian distribution of the number of particles in the system : @xmath230 .",
    "the negativity of reduced @xmath145-qubit density matrices averaged over a renormalized , truncated poissonian distribution : @xmath231 .",
    "the negativity of averaged , reduced @xmath145-qubit density matrices : @xmath232 .",
    "now , we lay out , what these quantities mean , and which aspect of entanglement they describe .",
    "+ ( i ) if we ask how much entanglement we find in the system on average we are led to the quantity @xmath230 , which is the expectation value of the average negativity of density matrices with different @xmath228 , where @xmath233 is the poissonian probability distribution for the number @xmath228 of particles in the system .",
    "observe that if we disallowed the fluctuation of the particle number in the system and introduced the reset mechanism by other means ( e.g. measurement and decay to standard state inside the box ) , the quantity of interest would simply be @xmath234 for fixed system size @xmath1 .",
    "\\(ii ) when we look at subsystems we are led to slightly different quantities .",
    "let us fix the subsystem size to @xmath145 qubits .",
    "we call the reduced density matrices of originally @xmath228 qubits @xmath235 where we assume @xmath236 . in gas - type systems",
    "there can also be zero or one particle in the box ( especially if @xmath237 is small ) , and the entanglement is simply zero in these cases . since a  reduction \" of a one or zero - qubit density matrix to a @xmath145-qubit density matrix makes no sense , we simply exclude these cases and rescale the truncated poissonian @xmath238 to the distribution @xmath239 .",
    "the quantity @xmath231 therefore tells us how much entanglement a subsystem of two qubits contains on average ( for @xmath145 qubits @xmath240 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) when we look only at a subsystem of two qubits disregarding the number of particles @xmath228 in the system , then our best description of the @xmath145-qubit density matrix is the average density matrix @xmath241 with entanglement @xmath232 .",
    "+ when we compare the three kinds of entanglement defined above we see that the conditions that one of these quantities be non - zero are increasingly stringent .",
    "to find entanglement in the reduced system is a more stringent condition since tracing out the other particles has the same effect as an additional noise source .",
    "also , to find entanglement in the averaged density matrix @xmath242 is a stricter condition since the averaging increases entropy , i.e. , tends to make the matrix more mixed .",
    "if we keep the particle number fixed , @xmath243 , there is just the quantity @xmath244 to describe the entanglement in the reduced state .    to compute",

    "we obtain similar results as in the case of gas - type systems underlining again how generic the reset mechanism is .",
