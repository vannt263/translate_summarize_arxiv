    "we represent the polypeptide chain pulled by an external force through a simple ising - like model @xcite , that is a generalization of the wako - sait - muoz - eaton ( wsme ) g  type model for protein folding @xcite .    in this model",
    "a @xmath2 residues polypeptide chain is described by @xmath3 binary variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , associated to the peptide bonds .",
    "the variable @xmath4 is equal to @xmath6 if the @xmath7-th bond is in a native state and @xmath8 if the bond is in an unfolded state . in the following a _ native stretch _",
    "will indicate a sequence of consecutive amino acids connected by native bonds and delimited by two non - native bonds . in order to characterize the state of such a stretch",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath9 with @xmath10 and the boundary conditions @xmath11 .",
    "thus , a native stretch delimited by bonds @xmath12 and @xmath13 is characterised by @xmath14 , while if the sequence is not a native stretch , @xmath15 . in the case of @xmath16",
    "the stretch corresponds to the single @xmath17-th residue .",
    "therefore , given a certain configuration @xmath18 of the chain , the number @xmath19 of native stretches is equal to @xmath20 .    in the wsme model",
    "two amino acids can interact only if they are in contact ( i.e. if they have at least a pair of nonhydrogen atoms closer than @xmath21   in the native structure deposited in the protein data bank ( pdb ) ) and if they belong to the same stretch .",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the energy gain associated to the contact between @xmath12-th and @xmath24-th amino acids ( see next subsection for details ) , @xmath25 is called contact matrix and its @xmath26 element takes the value @xmath27 if such a contact exists in the native structure while @xmath28 otherwise or if @xmath29 ( since if the amino acids are so close in the chain sequence , they have pair of atoms closer than @xmath21   even in the unfolded state ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is the entropic cost of ordering bond @xmath12 . in the following we define @xmath31 . in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been discussed how to compute exactly the partition function of the wsme model through a transfer - matrix formalism .    in our generalized model",
    "we substitute the entropic term for the coupling to the force described by a potential energy function @xmath32 depending on the end - to - end length of the protein @xmath33 : @xmath34 in our simulations the protein is pulled either by a constant force or at constant pulling velocity . in the first case the force @xmath35 applied to the protein ends is constant and the potential energy takes the form @xmath36 , while in the second case the energy is time  dependent : @xmath37 , where @xmath7 is a spring constant , @xmath38 is the pulling velocity and @xmath39 is the initial equilibrium elongation .    in order to define the length @xmath33 we assume that each stretch ( @xmath14 ) can be only parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the applied force and we implement such an assumption through a new binary variable @xmath40 that can take the values @xmath41 or @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the end - to - end length of the protein is defined as the sum of the lengths @xmath43 of each stretch multiplied by @xmath40 : @xmath44 where the dynamic variable @xmath45 is a set of @xmath19 variables @xmath40 , each one associated to a stretch . since the @xmath12-th aminoacid is represented by the sequence of its @xmath46 nitrogen , @xmath47 central carbon and @xmath48 carbon atoms , the lengths @xmath43 are obtained from the pdb structure as the native distance between the midpoint of the @xmath49 and @xmath46 atoms and the midpoint of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 atoms .",
    "dealing with the case of constant force , since the variables @xmath40 do not interact among themselves , it is possible to obtain an effective hamiltonian which has the same structure of the hamiltonian ( [ hwsme ] ) of the initial model and therefore the equilibrium thermodynamics is exactly solvable also in this case .",

    "since an experimental measurement of this quantity is missing , it has been chosen on the basis of the estimates reported in @xcite . a detailed discussion about the choice of energy and force scales in the model has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium unfolding kinetics have been studied by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "more precisely , in the framework of a master equation approach @xcite , we choose transition rates according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "rigorously speaking , this choice can not be derived from an underlying microscopic dynamics of the molecule .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite that it reproduces many quantitative and qualitative aspects of folding and unfolding of real molecules under an external force .",

    "such behaviour seems to be connected to the function of the rgd motif arg@xmath114-gly@xmath115-asp@xmath116  @xcite . when the module is fully folded , the rgd motif is available for adhesion , while if strand g is pulled and detached from the remainder of the module , the rgd motif gets closer to the surface of the module and is not functional .",
    "strand g detachment may be rapidly followed by complete unfolding or by an intermediate state .",
    "a possibility is that strand a detaches almost at the same time of strand g while the remaining part of the molecule stays folded for a certain time before complete unfolding .",
    "this kind of unfolding pathway will be labeled with _ ag _ , its intermediate end - to - end length is about @xmath117 nm .",
    "it may happen that instead of strand a , strand f detaches together with g , such unfolding pathway ( intermediate end - to - end length @xmath118 nm ) will be labeled _",
    "gf_.    the last possibility occurs only in the biologically relevant regime of low forces .",
    "it is believed @xcite that such relevant forces , in vivo , are of the same order of magnitude as the equilibrium unfolding force ( @xmath119 pn , see section [ equilibrium ] ) , though forces as low as 5 pn have been suggested @xcite as typical unfolding forces .",
    "our low force unfolding pathway is a mixture of the previous two : strands a and g are the first to unfold , then , before the molecule completely unfolds , a refolds and f unfolds",
    ". this may happen reversibly many times in a single trajectory with consecutive folding ( unfolding ) of strand a and parallel unfolding ( folding ) of strand f. such trajectories will be labeled _",
    "mixed ag - gf _ because the molecule is fluctuating between two different intermediates ( _ ag _ and _ gf _ ) .",
    "these intermediates have almost the same end - to - end length , and therefore can not be distinguished in a simple free energy landscape , as illustrated in fig .",

    "other typical trajectories are plotted in @xcite . during thermalization , before turning the force on at time @xmath121 , the length of the polypeptide chain fluctuates around @xmath122 ( fig.[fig : figuref65]a ) , since different orientations of the molecule are equally likely .",
    "then , at time @xmath121 , a waiting phase starts , which can be easily seen in fig.[fig : figuref65]b and fig.[fig : figuref65]d .",
    "this waiting phase corresponds to a metastable state which is characterised by an end - to - end length @xmath123 nm corresponding to the elongation in the native state .",
    "the rise in the end - to - end length to the intermediate value is always associated to the drop in order parameters connected to two different pairs of strands , with the gf pair always involved .",
    "the order parameters which have not been plotted go to zero only when the protein reaches the fully elongated configuration ( end - to - end length @xmath124 nm ) .    in fig.[fig : figuref28agf ] we report a _ mixed ag - gf _ trajectory obtained at force @xmath101 pn , slightly larger than the equilibrium unfolding force : after the long waiting phase there are two different intermediate states before the complete unfolding . despite the large fluctuations in the order parameters associated to the pairs c - f and a - b , it is still possible to see their general behaviour and to recognize the first intermediate state as _ ag _ and the second as _",
    "gf_. we stress that the _ gf _ and _ ag _ intermediates have very similar end - to - end length and fraction of native contacts @xmath88 ( for the whole chain ) , making them indistinguishable in simple , one  dimensional , free energy landscapes : indeed , they are lumped together in the broad minimum at @xmath120 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : elandscape ] .",
    "both the waiting and intermediate states ( as the whole unfolding process ) are characterised by time lengths varying in a wide range of values for different applied forces and , because of stochasticity , for different trajectories . in table",
    "[ tab : lifetime ] we reported the mean life times at various constant forces .",
    "the times @xmath125 and @xmath126 are obtained by an average of the times occurring between the first and the second jump in the end - to - end length , which have been fixed using the respective threshold values @xmath127  and @xmath128 .",
    "these averages have been calculated only for those trajectories which exhibit the corresponding unfolding pathway , while @xmath125 and @xmath126 at force @xmath80 pn and @xmath126 at force @xmath129 pn are not reported in the table because of vanishing frequencies of the corresponding trajectories , as shown in table [ tab : frequencies ] .",
    "the mean waiting phase time @xmath130 is the average over the @xmath77 trajectories of the time at which the end - to - end length becomes longer than the threshold value @xmath127 . for forces",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath67 pn it does not make sense to define a waiting phase life time , since the protein starts to unravel as soon as the external force is applied at @xmath121 . finally , the unfolding mean time @xmath132 is the average on all the trajectories of the unfolding time , i.e. the time at which the molecule reaches the unfolding length previously defined .",
    "the probability distributions of intermediate life times for @xmath133 pn have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : istolifetimeint ] , where it can be seen that both distributions can be fitted to the negative exponential function @xmath134 ( where @xmath83 is ag or gf , @xmath135 is the intermediate life time of @xmath83 , @xmath136 its average ) , and that _ ag _ has a longer life than _",
    "gf_. being the unfolding time the sum of the waiting phase time and of the intermediate state time we can naively conclude that if the protein follows the gf pathway , it will reach the unfolded state earlier .",
    "for the same reason and since at @xmath133 pn the dominant contribution to the unfolding time comes from @xmath137 and @xmath138 we can argue that at this force the exponential function fits well the unfolding times distribution too @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at very high forces a lognormal distribution of unfolding times has been proposed @xcite .",

    "lowering the force the contributions of @xmath137 and @xmath138 to the global unfolding time become important while the waiting phase , if it exists , is still quite short .",
