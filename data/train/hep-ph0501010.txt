    "approximate flavor su(3 ) symmetry of strong interactions predicts that hadrons are grouped into certain multiplets ( families ) @xcite : singlets , octets ( @xmath18 ) , decuplets ( @xmath19 ) , antidecuplets ( @xmath20 ) , 27-plets , 35-plets , etc .",
    "it is a piece of textbook wisdom that all known hadrons , which can constitute of three quarks , can be successively placed into singlets , octets and decuplets @xcite and that other ( higher ) su(3 ) representations are not required .",
    "the discoveries of the @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite , if confirmed @xcite , mean the existence of the whole new exotic family  the antidecuplet .    in qcd and in nature , su(3 ) is broken by non - equal masses of the up , down and strange quarks . as a result",
    ", members of different su(3 ) multiplets of the same spin and parity can mix .",
    "if the antidecuplet has indeed @xmath0 as predicted in the chiral quark - soliton approach @xcite , then the antidecuplet can potentially mix with three known @xmath0 octets and with a @xmath0 decuplet .",
    "in addition to the traditional su(3 ) multiplets , the antidecuplet can also mix with a 27-plet and a 35-plet @xcite .",
    "the degree of mixing due to su(3 ) violation among su(3 ) multiplets , especially in the baryon sector , can not be large in order for the notion of approximate su(3 ) symmetry to make sense .",
    "however , in the meson sector , there are known exceptions from small mixing because of the accidental degeneracy in mass of a singlet and an octet member .",
    "the most celebrated example is the large ( ideal ) mixing between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 vector mesons  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we consider the mixing angles ( the parameters which describe the mixing ) as small parameters .",
    "because of the small width of the @xmath11 @xcite , small mixing with the antidecuplet does not affect the properties of the involved octets . however , the decays of the @xmath24 members dramatically depend on even very small mixing .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the scenario that the antidecuplet mixes simultaneously with three octets  with the ground - state octet , with the octet containing @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and with the octet containing @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  and with a 27-plet and a 35-plet .",
    "the coupling constants and the mixing angles with the ground - state octet and with the 27-plet and 35-plet are taken from the chiral quark soliton model @xcite .",
    "for the other two octets , the coupling constants are determined from the @xmath25 fit to the available decay widths , and the two corresponding mixing angles are left as free parameters .",
    "this strategy enables us to present the general expressions for the @xmath26 decay widths , where @xmath27 is the ground - state baryon and @xmath28 is the ground - state pseudoscalar meson , as functions of the two mixing angles , the total width of the @xmath11 and the pion - nucleon sigma term . using scarce experimental information on the observation , non - observation and decays of the members of the antidecuplet , we give most probable regions of the mixing angles and make predictions for the yet unmeasured decay modes of the @xmath24 .",
    "this enables us to suggest the reactions most favorable for the excitation and identification of the members of the antidecuplet .",
    "we examine the scenario that the antidecuplet mixes simultaneously with three octets . the mixing takes place through the @xmath30-like and @xmath31-like states of the involved multiplets .",
    "the physical octet @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the antidecuplet @xmath35 states can be expressed in terms of the octet states , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the purely antidecuplet @xmath39 state , @xmath40 assuming that the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 mixing angles are small . a similar equation relates the physical @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 states to the octet @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 states and the purely antidecuplet @xmath51 state after the replacement @xmath52 .    in our analysis",
    ", we assume that the @xmath53 mixing angles are small , @xmath54 .",
    "the small parameter @xmath55 describes not only the violation of flavor su(3 ) symmetry due to the non - zero mass of the strange quark , but also a possible additional dynamical suppression of the mixing between exotic and non - exotic states .",
    "in addition , the smallness of @xmath53 rests on the previous phenomenological analyses of non - exotic baryon multiplets , which observed only small mixing angles , see e.g. @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we systematically neglect @xmath56 terms .",
    "therefore , the mixing matrix in eq .",
    "( [ nmix ] ) is unitary up to @xmath56 corrections .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath57 states can mix among themselves .",
    "indeed , our analysis @xcite shows that the @xmath58 and @xmath57 states are slightly mixed and that the @xmath36 state can be considered as a pure state ( it does not have components from other su(3 ) multiplets ) .",
    "therefore , in practice the problem of mixing of the antidecuplet with the three octets is solved in two steps .",
    "first , we determine the su(3 ) coupling constants and the mixing angles for the three octets . because of the smallness of @xmath59 and @xmath53 , it is legitimate to neglect the antidecuplet admixture at this stage .",
    "details of this analysis are presented in appendix  [ sec:34 ] .",
    "second , the resulting octet states are mixed with the antidecuplet states .",
    "naturally , since the possible mixing among the octets was already been taken into account in step one , it is sufficient to consider only the mixing of each individual @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) with @xmath62  see eq .",
    "( [ nmix ] ) .",
    "the same procedure applies to the considered octet and antidecuplet @xmath31 states .",
    "the assumption of small mixing angles with the antidecuplet is in stark contrast with the quark model calculations  @xcite , which automatically lead to almost ideal   mixing  @xcite .",
    "indeed , eigenstates of a generic quark model hamiltonian have separately almost well - defined number of strange quarks and strange antiquarks . in the language of approximate flavor su(3 )",
    "symmetry , this can be realized only by almost ideal mixing of su(3 ) states , which contain both non - strange and hidden strange components , such that the states resulting after the mixing contain mostly either non - strange quarks or strange quarks .",
    "of course , both small mixing and large mixing scenarios are assumptions which must be confronted with the data .",
    "a straightforward @xmath25 analysis of the available @xmath1 and @xmath5 partial decays widths shows that the popular scenario of jaffe and wilczek @xcite , which assumes nearly ideal mixing of @xmath1 ( mostly octet state ) with @xmath5 ( mostly antidecuplet state ) , is inconsistent with the experimental data on the @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays @xcite : it is impossible to simultaneously accommodate @xmath63 mev and a large @xmath64 . the same conclusion , but without the @xmath25 fit , was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the physical states are eigenstates of the mass operator @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding physical masses @xmath66 are @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass of the unmixed @xmath69 state and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , to the leading order in the su(3)-violation effect , the physical masses are equal to the corresponding masses of the unmixed states .",
    "this means that the gell - mann  okubo mass formulas are not sensitive to the small mixing , if it is treated consistently . keeping only terms linear in the mass of the strange quark , it is not legitimate to estimate the mixing angles from the gell - mann  okubo mass splitting formula , as was done for instance in @xcite . instead ,",
    "as will be shown below , one has to consider decays since , in the presence of multiplet mixing , the decay widths contain a first power of the mixing angles .    since the mechanism of the mixing of the @xmath30-states and @xmath31-states is the same , the mixing angles @xmath53 and @xmath71 are related @xcite @xmath72 however , since @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 when we consistently neglect @xmath56 terms .",
    "in our analysis we assume that su(3 ) symmetry is violated only by the non - equal masses of hadrons inside a given multiplet and by the multiplet mixing and that it is preserved   in the decays .",
    "the success of this assumption was proven in @xcite .",
    "this allows one to make definite predictions for the @xmath76 transitions in terms of the antidecuplet and octet universal coupling constants .",
    "the general su(3 ) formula for the @xmath77 coupling constants reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the antidecuplet universal coupling constant ; the factors in parenthesis are su(3 ) isoscalar factors , which are known for any su(3 ) multiplets @xcite ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 are hypercharges and isospins of the baryons @xmath82 ; @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the hypercharge and isospin of the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "because of the mixing with octets , we also need the coupling constants for the @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 transitions .",
    "the former is defined as @xmath88    in the su(3 ) symmetric limit , the coupling constants for the @xmath86 transition are parametrized in terms of the universal octet coupling constant @xmath89 , the ratio @xmath90 ( we choose our notations in such a way that @xmath91 for the ground - state octet in the naive quark model ) and su(3 ) isoscalar factors @xmath92 \\ , .",

    "the @xmath99 , @xmath102 and @xmath101 parameters can be determined by considering two - body hadronic decays of the two octets , see @xcite and appendix  [ sec:34 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath103 decay is possible only due to the mixing .    turning to the @xmath15 ,",
    "its coupling constants read @xmath104 like in the case of the @xmath105 decay , the @xmath106 decay is only possible because of the mixing .",
    "finally , the coupling constants for the @xmath107 decays are @xmath108 one sees that the @xmath109 decay is unique in that it completely determines the @xmath79 coupling constant .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : decays : theta])-([eq : decays : xi ] ) generalize the corresponding expressions of @xcite because in addition to the mixing with the ground - state octet , we consider simultaneous mixing with two additional octets .    using eqs .",

    "it is important to note that there is no universal prescription for the choice of the phase space factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps ] ) : different choices of the phase space factor correspond to different mechanisms of su(3 ) violation , which is out of theoretical control . therefore , it is purely a phenomenological issue which phase space factor to use in the calculation of the partial decay width .",

    "( [ eq : ps ] ) works poorly for the decays of the ground - state decuplet and that it should be modified @xcite .",
    "this issue was recently hotly debated @xcite in relation to the prediction of the total width of the @xmath11 in the chiral quark soliton model .",
    "we emphasize that the heart of the problem lies not in a particular dynamical model for strong interactions ( be it a chiral quark soliton model or any generic quark model ) but in a phenomenological , i.e. rather general , observation that approximate flavor su(3 ) symmetry can not simultaneously describe all four decays of the ground - state decuplet .",

    "<S> we give general expressions for the partial decay widths of all members of the antidecuplet as functions of the two mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> identifying @xmath9 with the @xmath10 observed by the graal experiment , we show that the considered mixing scenario can accommodate all present experimental and phenomenological information on the @xmath11 and @xmath9 decays : @xmath11 could be as narrow as 1 mev ; the @xmath12 decay is sizable , while the @xmath13 decay is suppressed and the @xmath14 decay is possibly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> constraining the mixing angles by the @xmath9 decays , we make definite predictions for the @xmath15 decays . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that @xmath15 with mass near 1770 mev could be searched for in the available data on @xmath16 invariant mass spectrum , which already revealed the @xmath11 peak . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to experimentally verify the decay properties of @xmath17 because its mass and @xmath0 make it an attractive candidate for @xmath15 . </S>"
