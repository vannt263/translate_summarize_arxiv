    "in recent days diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) is one of the severe eye diseases causing blindness . with early stage detection and treatment",
    "the patient can be saved from losing sight .",
    "automatic computer aided diagnosis system will reduce burden on specialists . also for monitoring and checking the progress of disease efficiently , automatic system will perform much better than human in terms of manual evaluation time . since comparison and evaluation of images manually is a time consuming task and images are subject to various distortions . for accurate analysis of progress of diabetic retinopathy , detection of exudate",
    "is mandatory .",
    "exudates are primary clinical symptoms of diabetic retinopathy",
    ". two types of exudates namely soft exudate and hard exudate appear .",
    "hard exudates are visible in non - proliferative diabetic retinopathy and soft exudates ( cotton wool spots ) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy .",
    "hard exudates represent the accumulation of lipid in or under the retina secondary to vascular leakage and visible as discrete yellowish deposits in color fundus images .",
    "cotton - wool spots are nerve fibre layer infarcts and they are visible as pale white rather than yellow . also exudates are variable in sizes and shapes . a typical pathological retinal image is depicted in fig . 1 to show features like the optic disc , the macula , the blood vessels and exudates .",
    "+        for identifying the stage of dr , classification of soft and hard exudates is foremost important to distinguish them for other retinal pathological features like drusen , heamorrhages , microaneurysms etc .",
    "fundus images are prone to artifacts related to defocus , motion blur , fingerprints etc .",
    "this artifacts are prone to interpretation as pathological features because of their similarity with exudates and drusen",
    ". one important defect of fundus image is luminosity and contrast variation , which is improperly addressed in many exudate detection methods .",
    "several methods have been presented for detection of exudates in colour fundus photograph using image processing and machine learning algorithms .",
    "sanchez et al .",
    "@xcite use a mixture model to separate exudate from background .",
    "an edge detection based method was used to remove other outliers .",
    "giancardo et al .",
    "@xcite use a kirsch s edge method to assign score for exudate candidate to a pre - processed .",
    "they have used background estimation and image normalization for pre - processing . for classification and detection of drusen , exudates and cotton wool spots ,",
    "a pixel wise classification algorithm is presented by niemeijer et al .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite use mathematical morphological and contextual features for candidate extraction followed by random forest based classification method for exudate detection .",
    "fuzzy c - means clustering based method was used for segmentation of features and neural network classifier for exudate detection by osareh et al .",
    "rocha et al .",
    "@xcite have addressed the problem of detecting bright and red lession by using one novel algorithm , they made use of surf features with machine learning method .",
    "but they failed to properly address the problems of luminance variation and artifacts .    in this work",
    ", we propose a novel exudate detection method using gaussian scale space based interest map ( gimap ) and mathematical morphology .",
    "this approach is robust to artefacts and illuminance variation .",
    "secondly a disease severity prediction method is developed by using information of exudate location with respect to the macula region and the optic disc .",
    "in addition to that we propose classification system using svm for hard and soft exudate .",
    "distinguishing exudate as hard and soft important for severity prediction also to identify type of diabetic retinopathy , whether it is non - proliferative or proliferative .",
    "section 2 presents our method . experimental setup and the results",
    "are discussed in section 3 and finally conclusions are are drawn in section 4 .",
    "exudate are the bright lessons found in retinal image , caused due to diabetic retinopathy , a most common disorder of eye with patient having diabetes .",
    "it is also a main reason of blindness . for detection of the optic disc and fovea , the method described by niemeijer et al .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "steps involve in this method is shown in fig .",
    "2 .          for correct detection and classification of hard and soft exudates",
    "it is important to reduce noise while preserving edges . in this method",
    "anisotropic diffusion filtering @xcite was used for reducing noise in the images and preserving edges .",
    "anisotropic diffusion filters have been proved to be succesful in edge preserving smooting and denoising of medical images .",
    "hard and soft exudates possesses discriminative edge structures , preserving this edge while reducing noise is also one of important step towards classification .",
    "step involves in filtering is as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    where i is the input image , ( r , g , b ) is color channel of it , k is diffusion constant and @xmath3 is noise standard deviation over which algorithm will be iterated to find solution .",
    "the diffusion function @xmath4 is a monotonically decreasing function of the image gradient magnitude .",
    "gaussian scale space based interest map can capture local image structure and scale invariant image features . since exudate varies on the basis of size and hence different exudate will response to different scales of gaussian . for identifying all exudate interest map using gaussian scale space was constructed @xcite .",
    "first step in the construction of gimap is the computation of 1st derivative of gaussian as filters at several scales and smoothed the derivative using gaussian filter and take absolute values of derivatives .",
    "in addition to that laplacian of gaussian for each scale was computed .",
    "because of colour difference between hard and soft exudates , they respond variably to colour channels . now taking the maximum response of all the colour channels final interest map for the scale",
    "is constructed .",
    "this process is repeated over different scales . for each scale",
    "we have two filter 1st derivative gaussian and laplacian of gaussian , take maximum of absolute values from both filter ouputs in the interest map . since our concerned features may appear in variable scales so interest map of each individual map is combined using maximum operation to form a decision making interest map . scale used in these works are @xmath5{2},k\\sqrt[]{2 } ... k^{n}\\sqrt[]{2})$ ] .",
    "the decision making interest map also contain some outliers such blood vessels , vein , haemorrhage etc .",
    "filtering process is described by following equations @xcite .",
    "@xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    for computation of laplacian of gaussian we have used difference of gaussian approximation . if @xmath9 be a filtered image , @xmath10 $ ] is its three color channel at a scale @xmath11 using filter @xmath12 , then the interest map for this scale is obtained by selecting maximum response over color channel as follows . @xmath13 and the decision making interest map is obtained taking maximum over filter @xmath12 and then scale @xmath11 as follows .",
    "@xmath14      the decision map obtained from above procedure need to be improved by reducing outliers present .",
    "first step is to enhance the features by using grayscale morphological operations . here",
    "closing operation with a disk structuring element of size 2 and 3 was used .",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16    if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are obtained after closing operation , then resulting enhanced image is obatined by following operation . @xmath19 where @xmath20 are pixels position in both images .    in the second step",
    "convert the interest map to binary map . for",
    "binarization of the interest map sauvola s @xcite local adaptive thresholding technique is used .",
    "local threshholding is efficient in this particular situation beacuse pixels values of hard and soft exudates vary significantly and to get both of those in final map we need to binarize using local windows .",
    "let @xmath21 is interest map image , take a window size of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the mean and standard deviation of window cantered at @xmath25 , then threshold @xmath26 will be defined as follows .",
    "@xmath27\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is maximum of standard deviation of all windows and @xmath29 $ ] is a parameter .    along with exudate other features such as blood vessels and veins",
    "is also detected due to gaussian scale space .",
    "morphological opening operation and connected component analysis was used for removing those unwanted features .",
    "blood vessels and veins are characterized by thin long geometrical structures .",
    "a rectangle structural element having width and length larger than the thickness of those blood vessels is used for removing those structures .",
    "remaining vessels and outliers left after this operation will be removed by using concept of convexity and connected component analysis . for each connected region we will compute convex hull of the region and define the following @xmath30 eq . ( 13 ) term . @xmath31",
    "the @xmath30 term computes probability of a connected region being exudate or not .",
    "it is the ratio of the area of the region convex hull and its area .",
    "this term will give approximate idea of the connected region .",
    "if the value of @xmath32 then the region will be discarded , the connected region will be considered as vessel structures or flash artifacts .    where @xmath33 is convex hull of the region @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the pixel positions . if convexity of a connected region is less than 0.2 then the area will be discarded .",
    "also we want to ensure that artifacts like flares gets removed from gimap . from observation",
    "it has been noticed that flares are circular shape object .",
    "none of the features like hard and soft exudate have shapes like that of flares , approximate circular .",
    "compactness ( @xmath36 ) is defined below eq . ( 14 ) of every connected region of the gimap should be less than @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are area and perimeter of the region @xmath34 respectively . in the final step",
    "we will use colour and luminance features to select exudates and remove outliers , in general we did nt observe outliers like flares , flash etc after adapting previos mentioned steps .",
    "but still there are possibility fo including drusens .",
    "hard and soft exudates are characterized by its yellowish and whitish color significantly different from that of haemorhages , microanerysms and other related features . at the end , a support vector machine classifier is used to get final labels of hard and soft exudates .",
    "two types of exudates namely hard and soft are associated with different diabetic retinopathy symptoms .",
    "we will use a support vector machine classifier to differentiate between soft and hard exudates and outliers .",
    "svm is one of most effective classifier , with its good generalization ability .",
    "selection and extraction of feature vector is one of the challenging task for efficient classification .",
    "since hard and soft exudates are varied in color magnitude we will use mean r , g , b values as feature for each detected regions .",
    "in addition , to ensure luminance invariance in classification process , images will be converted to lab color space and values of a , b channels will be used as features .",
    "both hard and soft exudates are varied in terms of shape and edge structures .",
    "hard exudates are chracterizes by uneven edge and soft exudates are by smooth edge and circular structures .",
    "firstly we will design features vector for classification by using following data .",
    "tabel 1 shows the features used in this method for svm .    *",

    "location with respect to the fovea and the optic disc determine severity of the diseases .",
    "if exudates location are close to those features and causes defect to those features then patients may lose vision .",
    "as per the norm of the international council of ophthalmology diabetic retinopathy @xcite divided in five groups specifically : none , mild , moderate , severe , and proliferate .",
    "we will define some rule to detect severity by using the fovea and the optic disc location as centre of two set of concentric circles .",
    "radius of each concentric circles with the fovea location as centre is multiple of 80 pixels .",
    "the radius selection for each circle based on the average value of the optic disc width and height .",
    "also for each concentric circles with the optic disc centre location as circle centre is multiple of 55 pixels .",
    "this setting valid for images with width 1500 pixels and height 1152 pixels .",
    "if exudates reside in vey inner circle then we label it as @xmath41 , other consecutive circle will be known as @xmath42 , where n is the index number of the circle , bigger n means circle is of bigger radius .",
    "for each circle area of exudate(no of pixels ) will be calculated . finally by using area and",
    "location information diseases severity will be predicted .",
    "if location of exudate in @xmath41 circle then on the basis of its areas it will included in proliferate or severe groups . here",
    "area of @xmath43 circle means area of @xmath44 circle .",
    "3 depicts the scenarios described above .",
    "@xmath45    where @xmath46 denotes area of exudate region , @xmath47 its distance from either the optic disc center or the fovea and @xmath48 $ ] are two constant function of distance .",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    where @xmath53 is a exudate pixel , @xmath54 denotes @xmath55 circle and @xmath56 its corresponding area .",
