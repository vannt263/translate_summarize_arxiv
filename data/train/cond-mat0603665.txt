    "<S> in this paper we study the scattering theory associated with the pseudofermion dynamical theory for the hubbard chain . while for the electronic basis the problem is non perturbative and strongly correlated , in terms of pseudofermions the spectral properties are controlled by zero - momentum forward scattering only . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that each ground - state  excited - energy - eigenstate transition corresponds to a well defined set of elementary two - pseudofermion zero - momentum forward - scattering events . an important point of the theory is that independent @xmath0-spin @xmath1 holons and spin @xmath1 spinons are neither scatterers nor scattering centers . instead , the scatterers and scattering centers are spin - less and @xmath0-spin - less @xmath2 pseudofermions , @xmath0-spin - zero @xmath3-holon composite @xmath4 pseudofermions , spin - zero @xmath3-spinon composite @xmath5 pseudofermions such that @xmath6 , and the corresponding pseudofermion holes . similarly to chromodynamics , </S>",
    "<S> where all quark - composite physical particles are color - neutral , for the pseudofermion dynamical theory all @xmath3-holon ( and @xmath3-spinon ) composite pseudofermion scatterers and scattering centers are @xmath0-spin - neutral ( and spin - neutral ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pseudofermion @xmath7 matrix is a mere phase factor , which is behind the simple form of the pseudofermion anti - commutators and the simplification of the study of the finite - energy spectral and dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudofermion @xmath7 matrix is expressed as a commutative product of @xmath7 matrices , each corresponding to an elementary two - pseudofermion scattering event . </S>",
    "<S> this commutative factorization is stronger than the usual factorization associated with yang - baxter equation for the original spin @xmath1 electron bare @xmath7 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal the scattering mechanisms which control the exotic finite - energy spectral properties of the low - dimensional complex materials and correlated systems of cold fermionic atoms on an optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the exotic scatterers and scattering centers predicted by the theory were observed by angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy in low - dimensional organic metals . </S>"
