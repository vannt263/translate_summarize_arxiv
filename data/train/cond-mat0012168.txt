    "<S> november 2000    * the effects of spin fluctuations on the tunneling spectroscopy in high-@xmath0 superconductors * c. l. wu@xmath1 , chung - yu mou@xmath2 , darwin chang@xmath3 + _ @xmath4national center for theoretical sciences , p.o.box 2 - 131 , hsinchu , taiwan _ + _ @xmath5stanford linear accelerator center , stanford university , stanford , ca 94309 , usa _ +    1.5 cm    \\{pacs numbers : 74.20.-z , 74.50.+r , 74.80.fp , 74.20.mn }    while a great details about the spectral function for high-@xmath0 superconductors ( hts ) have been revealed by the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , a complete description of the superconducting state requires knowledge of the anomalous green s function . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally the tunneling spectroscopy has been considered as one of the tools which can probe the anomalous green s function . in particular , measuring the subgap conductance of a junction consisting of a normal metal and a superconductor ( ns ) is the most convenient configuration for such a purpose . to calculate the conductance in the ns configuration , blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk@xcite(btk ) developed a formalism using bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mean - field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the btk theory has been phenomenologically extended to investigate the tunneling phenomena in various ns junctions@xcite . on the experimental side , even though the d - wave bcs mean field theory captures some features of the superconducting state , the recent high resolution data from both arpes and stm gives a more delicate picture . </S>",
    "<S> a new feature is the appearance of so called peak / dip / hump structure , which is most clearly seen along the [ 100 ] direction in the superconducting state for arpes @xcite and for stm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested@xcite that it stems from the coupling of electrons to the @xmath6 resonance observed in neutron scattering studies@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been further explored both qualitatively@xcite and quantitatively@xcite , confirming its validity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the peak / dip / hump structure , there are also indications that the quasi - particle peak seems not to be resolution limited@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these features indicate the need for a tunneling theory that includes the effect of fluctuations .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of the spin fluctuations on the tunneling conductance spectra along the [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] ( c - axis ) directions@xcite . by using the keldysh formulation , </S>",
    "<S> we first demonstrate that in the high junction resistance limit , the dominant contribution comes from the spectral function and the peak / dip / hump structure exists in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> this structure results from collective spin fluctuations and weakens as the doping @xmath7 increases as reflected in some of the recent data , such as in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since spin excitations are gapped , they induce little qualitative change in the subgap region . instead , their main effect is to redistribute the spectral weight and thus changes the relative strength among currents due to difference tunneling processes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to investigate the other limit when the subgap is dominated by the andreev reflection , we define the _ optimum matching _ as the condition when the zero bias andreev conductance peak reaches maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the @xmath8  case in the btk theory . under this condition </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the andreev peak can coexist with the dip / hump structure , which should be observable in the recent future . </S>",
    "<S> base on our analysis , we will also give a possible explanation on a recently observed c - axis stm data @xcite , which shows an unexpected step like feature in the negative bias in addition to the peak / dip / hump structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering a junction consisting of a 2d normal metal on the left ( @xmath9 ) hand side ( @xmath10 ) and a 2d superconductor ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the lattice constant ) on the right ( @xmath13 ) hand side , governed by the hamiltonian @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling hamiltonian that connects the surface points at @xmath16 and @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , where the summation is over lattice points along the interface , chosen to be in the y direction . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the simplest case when the lattice points along the interfaces are equally spaced and match the bulk lattice of the metal and the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductor is assumed to have a square lattice with one of the axis parallel to the x direction . </S>",
    "<S> the total grand hamiltonian is then given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the chemical potentials and their difference @xmath22 is fixed to be the voltage drop @xmath23 across the junction .    </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling current can be calculated perturbatively by using the keldysh formalism@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach was previously applied successfully to study a number of tunneling problems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall follow ref.@xcite and neglect the vertex corrections of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation series in @xmath24 can be then summed exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution to the differential conductance @xmath25 can be classified into four terms due to different tunneling processes@xcite : @xmath26 is due to particle to particle tunneling ; @xmath27 is due to particle to particle tunneling with pair creation / annihilation as the intermediate state ; @xmath28 is due to particle to hole tunneling ; and @xmath29 is the andreev conductance . because @xmath24 is a tight binding model , all the green s functions have to be replaced by the surface green s functions that connect different points on the junction . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is an extra integration over @xmath30 and associated with each surface green s function , there is a @xmath31 factor . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath32 characterizes the spread of the electron wave function along y direction when hopping across the junction and can be generally expanded in a cos fourier series . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bare surface green s function , without being renormalized by @xmath24 , is a 2@xmath332 matrix @xmath34 in nambu s notation@xcite , and its relation to the bare bulk green s function @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , where the momentum @xmath37 is in unit @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relations of conductance @xmath39 to the green s functions can be best demonstrated in the limit when the metal is approximated by its bandwidth @xmath40 with a constant density of state , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a unit matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids complications due to the band structure from the metal side . in this case , when @xmath43 is a constant , the only dimensionless parameter is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the hopping scale of the superconducting side . </S>",
    "<S> the junction conductance is then of order @xmath46 . for small @xmath47 , @xmath48 is @xmath49 and </S>",
    "<S> is simply proportional to the single particle density of state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath50 is of order @xmath51 and probes @xmath52 ^2 $ ] , @xmath53 is of the order @xmath54 and probes @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> here 1 and 2 are indices for nambu notations , green s functions with the index @xmath56 are retarded and @xmath57 is the spectral function . since @xmath28 is subdominant to @xmath50 , @xmath58  is negative . finally , the andreev conductance is @xmath51 and probes @xmath59 ^2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> overall speaking , for small @xmath60 , the total conductance is dominated by @xmath26 , corresponding to the large @xmath61 limit of the btk theory . in the other limit when @xmath29 dominates in the sub - gap region , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more subtle . for s - wave bcs superconductors , the analytic mapping from @xmath61 to @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> was obtained in ref  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum matching ( @xmath8 ) does not occur at large @xmath47 because the mapping is not monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> in general , such analytic mapping does not exist , we shall resort to numerics to find the optimum matching condition .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider a simple d - wave bcs superconductor described by @xmath62 where the dispersion @xmath63 $ ] , and the gap @xmath64 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the metal side has the same hamiltonian with @xmath65 . under the optimum matching condition , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a single peak ( the andreev peak ) in the total conductance near @xmath66@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the andreev peak obtained here is a result of subtle balance between @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the effect of @xmath68 is to bring down the quasi - particle peaks in @xmath48 so that a single peak is manifested . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , such simple realization of the andreev peak does not always happen in real high - tc systems due to spin fluctuations .    to include the spin fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , we shall work with the 2d @xmath69 model . </S>",
    "<S> in the slave - boson method , the physical electron operators @xmath70 are expressed by slave bosons @xmath71 carrying the charge and fermions @xmath72 representing the spin ; @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field @xmath74-wave sc state is characterized by the order parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the condensate of bosons @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([mean ] ) is then the hamiltonian for the spinons , @xmath78 , with dispersion @xmath79 - 4\\delta { t_r}^{\\prime } \\cos ( k_x)\\cos ( k_y)-\\mu_r $ ] and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall adopt the following numerical values @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84ev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 and the chemical potential @xmath87 for different doping @xmath88 are obtained from a self - consistent calculation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next we include the spin fluctuations by perturbing around the mean field hamiltonian @xmath89 , i.e. , we write @xmath90 , and treat @xmath91 as a perturbation . in order to account for the @xmath6 resonance@xcite as well as many other effects of spin fluctuations , we calculate the spin susceptibility in a modified random - phase approximation ( rpa ) as defined in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the usual rpa sums over selected sets of graphs for the spin susceptibility @xmath92 as shown in fig.1(a ) and gives rise to @xmath93 $ ] with @xmath94 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the _ unperturbed _ spin susceptibility due to the spinon bubbles and the @xmath6 resonance emerges as the pole of the denominator . in the current approach , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath97 is not one and is considered as a phenomenological parameter whose value is chosen such that the af instability occurs right at the experimental observed value @xmath98 . for the material parameters we adopt , @xmath99 is @xmath100@xcite .    the inelastic scattering of electrons off the spin fluctuations is taken into account by incorporating @xmath92 into the self energy of the spinons in the lowest - order approximation . in the sc state , there are two different self - energies @xmath101 and @xmath102 as shown in fig.1(b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the green s function for spinons is calculated by @xmath103^{-1}$ ] with @xmath104^{-1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> since bosons condense , the physical electron green s function can be simply obtained by @xmath105 , i.e. , only the dynamics of spins is considered . following previous prescriptions , </S>",
    "<S> one then obtains the surface green s functions and thus the various conductance . </S>",
    "<S> the truncation to the lowest order can not really be justified rigorously so far . </S>",
    "<S> its merit rests mainly upon its simplicity and its usefulness in previous applications to problems related to spin fluctuations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies indicate that it has captured the main features of arpes data along [ 100 ] direction and for other directions it also reproduces the observed @xmath106 deviation from the pure @xmath74-wave@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall examine its validity against tunneling data . </S>",
    "<S> note also that we had neglected the spatial dependence of the pair potential , which is generally considered not important in [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] directions .    </S>",
    "<S> we first analyze small @xmath47 limit . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the total conductance with rpa correction for various dopings . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the peak and hump are seen to scale weakly with doping . </S>",
    "<S> when doping increases , the height of peak increases with doping , in consistent with experiments@xcite , at the same time , the width of the peak increases and tends into the hump region so that the hump is smeared out in slightly overdoped region . </S>",
    "<S> another feature which can also be observed in the data is that the dip / hump feature at positive bias is always weaker . </S>",
    "<S> the precise reason behind them can be traced back to the underlying structure of @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , detailed analysis@xcite shows that the band edge extends to higher positive bias so that the dip / hump is smeared , while the band edge for negative bias essentially stays at small bias , leaving the dip / hump unsmeared .    </S>",
    "<S> we now numerically identify the optimum matching condition so that the zero bias andreev conductance peak can be manifested best . </S>",
    "<S> for each @xmath30 , we compute the optimal value @xmath108 such that the andreev conductance at @xmath66 reaches maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath109 can be approximated by @xmath110 this implies that including next nearest neighbor hopping along the junction is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , the forward hopping @xmath111 still dominates ( for instance , when @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.3 , we show the optimal manifestation of the andreev peak for different doping . </S>",
    "<S> the metal side is modeled by a simple tight - binding model on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the dip / hump structure coexists with the andreev peak . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows a similar plot but now the density of state of the metal side is a constant . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the andreev peak never out wins the quasi - particle peaks resulted from @xmath48 so that a plateau is observed . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the trend of the dip / hump structure with doping is consistent with what is found in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> all these qualitative features should be experimentally verified in the future as a test of the mechanism of the spin fluctuations .    to further test this particular rpa approach , we compute the c - axis tunneling spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows our numerical results , in comparison to the recent stm curve by pan _ </S>",
    "<S> et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite encouraging that two curves are very similar in the shape . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the step around 45 @xmath116 is reproduced in the rpa approach at slightly larger bias . </S>",
    "<S> this step results from the band edge , which , as we mentioned , essentially stays at small bias as one changes doping .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed the effects of spin fluctuations on the sn junction using the keldysh formulation and a modified random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the peak / dip / hump structure is reproduced and we show that it disappears gradually as one goes to slightly overdoped region . </S>",
    "<S> using the same formulation , we predict that the dip / hump structure can coexist with the zero bias andreev peak in optimal matching conditions . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis on the c - axis tunneling shows good qualitative agreement between this approach and the recently observed stm tunneling curve .    </S>",
