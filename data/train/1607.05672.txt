    "the heavy fermion material uru@xmath2si@xmath2 has been a subject of long - standing interest since the discovery of a phase transition at t@xmath6  =  17.5  k , thirty years ago  @xcite .",
    "initially thought to be an antiferromagnetic transition , the small antiferromagnetic moment of 0.03  @xmath4 that arises in this material is far too small to account for the large specific heat jump at t@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "three decades of research have produced a number of conclusions regarding the nature of this phase  @xcite , but have failed to determine the order parameter , leading to this phase being dubbed the ` hidden order ' phase . to study the behavior of the hidden order phase ,",
    "a large number of perturbations have been applied to the system in the form of applied field , hydrostatic pressure and chemical substitution . in all cases ,",
    "the hidden order phase is destroyed with relatively small perturbations : applied fields of @xmath735  t  @xcite , hydrostatic pressure @xmath70.8  gpa  @xcite and chemical substitution of typically greater than 5  % on any of the atomic sites  @xcite . in nearly every case , the hidden order state is suppressed continuously , and a ferro- or antiferromagnetic state emerges .    neutron scattering has played an important role in determining the properties of the hidden order phase .",
    "for example , while careful study has shown that the small antiferromagnetic moment is present even in ultra - clean samples  @xcite , it is likely caused by inhomogeneous strain  @xcite . within the paramagnetic phase above t@xmath6 , inelastic neutron scattering measurements observed gapless , weakly dispersing features at the @xmath8 point on the brillouin zone ( bz ) edge with @xmath9  =  ( 1@xmath10  0  0 ) ( @xmath11  =  0.407 ) , while below t@xmath6 , these excitations became gapped ( @xmath12  =  4.5 - 4.8  mev  @xcite ) and more intense  @xcite .",
    "it was determined that the gapping of these excitations results in an entropy change of sufficient size to account for the specific heat jump at t@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "below t@xmath6 additional , commensurate excitations appear at the @xmath13 point of the bz , @xmath14 , with a gap of @xmath15  =  1.7 - 1.8  mev  @xcite .",
    "this wavevector is the ordering wavevector for the antiferromagnetic moment in both the hidden order and more conventional magnetically - ordered phases . since the transition at t@xmath6 is related to the gapping of the incommensurate excitations and the emergence of the commensurate ones , these have both been cited as possible ` signatures ' of the hidden order state in neutron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "the first instance in which perturbations were found to enhance the hidden order state was through the use of applied pressure .",
    "application of pressure increased t@xmath6 slightly , reaching 18.5  k at a pressure of 0.5  gpa  @xcite .",
    "however , at higher pressures , this system still transitions to an antiferromagnetic state ; at t  =  0 this occurs at approximately 0.8  gpa .",
    "pressures between 0.8 and 1.4  gpa have both a hidden order and a nel transition , while above 1.4  gpa the transition is directly from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic at t@xmath16  =  19.5  k  @xcite . due to this interplay of hidden order and antiferromagnetism , studying the behavior under applied pressure has become of particular interest in trying to determine the nature of the unknown order parameter .",
    "likewise , the chemical substituents that enhance t@xmath6 have also become an interesting avenue of research for determining the order parameter of the hidden order state .",
    "of the dozens of chemical dopings that have been applied to uru@xmath2si@xmath2 only two dopings , both on the ru site , have been shown to increase the value of t@xmath6 : fe  @xcite and os  @xcite . in both of these cases",
    ", the transition temperature continues to increase as a function of doping , over a large range , before dropping abruptly .",
    "interestingly , of all of the pure compounds of the family u@xmath17si@xmath2 , @xmath18  =  fe and os are the only two that are non - magnetic  @xcite . furthering the analogy between hydrostatic pressure and fe / os - doping ,",
    "the doped systems are also observed to become more conventionally antiferromagnetic with increasing chemical pressure , however no signature of multiple transitions have been observed with transport measurements  @xcite .",
    "it was speculated that these systems experience only a gradual crossover between the hidden order and antiferromagnetic states , although this remains an open question .    in this work",
    ", we use elastic and inelastic neutron scattering to measure the magnetic structure and excitations of various doping concentrations within the u(ru@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2si@xmath2 series , in an attempt to determine the nature of the hidden order - to - antiferromagnetic crossover , as well as whether the doped compounds contain inelastic signatures of the hidden order state and/or signatures of a conventional antiferromagnetic state ( spin waves ) .",
    "recently , neutron diffraction measurements have been carried out on a number of dopings in this series  @xcite , which found that the magnetic moment grows continuously from @xmath5  =  0 to @xmath5  =  0.05 and that at dopings above 5% the magnetic moment remains relatively constant at 0.8  @xmath4 .",
    "this leads the authors to suggest that 5% doping marks the hidden order - to - antiferromagnetic phase transition , analogous to the transition at 0.8  gpa in the parent compound under pressure  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in order to study the nature of the excitations through the transition , it is important to measure dopings both above and below @xmath5  =  0.05 .",

    "stoichiometric amounts of depleted uranium , ru ( 99.95% ) , fe ( 99.99% ) and si ( 99.9999% ) were arc - melted on a water - cooled copper hearth in a mono - arc furnace under an inert ar atmosphere .",
    "the resulting polycrystalline boule was then used to grow the single crystals using the czochralski method .",
    "this was performed in a tri - arc furnace using a water - cooled copper hearth under a continuously - gettered ar atmosphere at 900  @xmath19c .",
    "after the growths , the single - crystalline nature and sample alignments were confirmed with laue x - ray diffraction .",
    "these samples were studied using elastic and inelastic neutron scattering at the high - flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) and the spallation neutron source ( sns ) of oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) .",
    "the diffraction measurements were performed on all of the samples using the hb-1a spectrometer at hfir , while inelastic measurements were done on the hb-1 ( for @xmath5  =  0.01 and 0.05 ) and hb-3 ( for @xmath5  = 0.025 , 0.10 and 0.15 ) triple - axis instruments at hfir , as well as the sequoia time - of - flight spectrometer at the sns ( for @xmath5=0.05 and 0.15 ) .",
    "for comparison , data on the parent compound has been included where appropriate ; this data was measured on the multi - axis crystal spectrometer ( macs ) at the nist center for neutron research and was published previously  @xcite .",
    "the neutron measurements described in this work were performed using 1 single crystal of each fe - doping : the @xmath5  =  0.01 sample had a mass of 5.65(2 )  g ; the @xmath5  =  0.025 sample had a mass of 1.99(1 )  g ; the @xmath5  =  0.05 sample had a mass of 2.98(1 )  g ; the @xmath5  =  0.10 sample had a mass of 1.85(1 )  g ; and the @xmath5  =  0.15 sample had a mass of 1.74(1 )  g. all of these samples were aligned in the [ h  0  l ] scattering plane for each of the neutron scattering experiments .",

    "this can also be seen by comparing the width of the excitations , which are unchanged under pressure  @xcite , but dramatically broadened in the case of fe doping .",
    "this study serves to illustrate that uru@xmath2si@xmath2 is ideally placed on the precipice of magnetic states : antiferromagnetism under pressure or fe - doping , and even ferromagnetism under re - doping  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we see that the excitation spectrum changes quantitatively , but not qualitatively , and is not destroyed by the emergence of the magnetically - ordered state  @xcite .",
    "thus this work demonstrates that in the fe - doped compounds studied here , as with other perturbations , the hidden order state is not incompatible with magnetic order but rather that the electronic correlations are intimately related to magnetism .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive set of elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on a range of fe - doped samples of u(ru@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2si@xmath2 with 0.01  @xmath3  0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> all of the samples measured exhibit long - range antiferromagnetic order , with the size of the magnetic moment quickly increasing to 0.51  @xmath4 at 2.5% doping and continuing to increase monotonically with doping , reaching 0.69  @xmath4 at 15% doping . </S>",
    "<S> time - of - flight and inelastic triple - axis measurements show the existence of excitations at ( 1  0  0 ) and ( 1.4  0  0 ) in all samples , which are also observed in the parent compound . while the excitations in the 1% doping are quantitatively identical to the parent material , the gap and width of the excitations change rapidly at 2.5% fe doping and above . the 1% doped sample shows evidence for a separation in temperature between the hidden order and antiferromagnetic transitions , suggesting that the antiferromagnetic state emerges at very low fe dopings . </S>",
    "<S> the combined neutron scattering data suggests not only discontinuous changes in the magnetic moment and excitations between the hidden order and antiferromagnetic phases , but that these changes continue to evolve up to at least @xmath5  =  0.15 .    </S>",
