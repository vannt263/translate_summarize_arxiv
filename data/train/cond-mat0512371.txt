    "periodic optical lattices produced by the interference of intersecting laser beams have been used extensively in recent years to confine , manipulate and control small clouds of ultracold atoms and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "such lattices are ideal tools for performing fundamental quantum physics experiments such as studies of low - dimensional quantum gases  @xcite and quantum tunnelling experiments including the bec superfluid to mott insulator quantum phase transition  @xcite",
    ". optical lattices also have potential application in quantum information processing since they may provide storage registers for qubits based on neutral atoms  @xcite .    an alternative approach for producing periodic lattices for ultracold atoms",
    "is to use the magnetic potentials of periodic arrays of magnetic microtraps .",
    "simple , one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnetic lattices consisting of arrays of 2d traps or waveguides have been proposed  @xcite and constructed using current - carrying wires  @xcite or permanent magnetic structures  @xcite on ` atom chips ' , and two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices of magnetic microtraps produced by crossed arrays of current - carrying wires have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "we have recently developed technology for producing high - quality magnetic microstructures based on permanent , perpendicularly magnetised magneto - optical @xmath1 films  @xcite .",
    "these magnetic microstructures have been used to construct periodic grooved magnetic mirrors for ultracold atoms  @xcite , which in the presence of bias magnetic fields can be transformed into a 1d magnetic lattice of 2d traps , and to produce atom chips for ultracold atoms and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 magneto - optical films exhibit excellent magnetic properties for atom optics applications : they can be deposited with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ; they have excellent magnetic homogeneity ; and they can have high permanent magnetisation ( @xmath2 ) , large coercivity ( @xmath3 ) and relatively high curie temperature ( @xmath4 ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose the use of periodic arrays of permanent magnetic films for producing magnetic lattices of microtraps for confining , manipulating and controlling small clouds of ultracold atoms and quantum degenerate gases .",
    "using analytical expressions and numerical calculations we show that it is possible to produce 1d and 2d permanent magnetic lattices with non - zero potential minima in which ultracold atoms prepared in low magnetic field - seeking states can be trapped without losses due to majorana spin flips .",
    "in particular , we show that two crossed separated layers of periodic arrays of parallel rectangular magnets plus bias magnetic fields , or a single layer of periodic arrays of square - shaped magnets having three different thicknesses plus bias fields , can produce 2d magnetic lattices of microtraps with non - zero potential minima and large and controllable trap depth and high trap frequency .",
    "magnetic lattices based on permanent magnetic films have potential advantages over optical lattices or magnetic lattices based on current - carrying wires that make them attractive for atom optics applications and compact integrated devices .",
    "they do not involve ( high intensity ) laser beams or any beam alignment , and there is no light scattering or decoherence due to spontaneous emission .",
    "they can produce highly stable reproducible potential wells with low technical noise .",
    "they can be produced with large trap depth and large magnetic field curvature , leading to very high trap frequencies , without heat dissipation , in contrast to current - carrying microwire devices .",
    "using modern microtechnology , permanent magnetic lattices may be fabricated with a wide range of periods from about @xmath5 down to about @xmath6 and they can in principle involve variable spacing between the lattice sites or complex potential shapes at each lattice site .",
    "finally , in magnetic lattices , only atoms in low magnetic field - seeking states are trapped and it should be possible to perform radiofrequency evaporative cooling _ in situ _ in the lattice , thereby allowing the study of very low temperature phenomena in lattices .",

    "<S> we propose the use of periodic arrays of permanent magnetic films for producing magnetic lattices of microtraps for confining , manipulating and controlling small clouds of ultracold atoms and quantum degenerate gases . </S>",
    "<S> using analytical expressions and numerical calculations we show that periodic arrays of magnetic films can produce one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic lattices with non - zero potential minima , allowing ultracold atoms to be trapped without losses due to spin flips . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that two crossed layers of periodic arrays of parallel rectangular magnets plus bias fields , or a single layer of periodic arrays of square - shaped magnets with three different thicknesses plus bias fields , can produce 2d magnetic lattices of microtraps having non - zero potential minima and controllable trap depth . for arrays with micron - scale periodicity , the magnetic microtraps can have very large trap depths ( @xmath00.5 mk for the realistic parameters chosen for the 2d lattice ) and very tight confinement . </S>"
