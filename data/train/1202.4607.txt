    "one of the most important issues in hadron spectroscopy is to determine the nature of the different hadronic states , mesons and baryons , which are reported in the pdg @xcite and still being found in new facilities like babar , bes , cleo , belle , cern facilities among others .",
    "the traditional wisdom that mesons are @xmath4 states and the baryons @xmath5 states has given room to more complicated structures in many cases , involving more quarks in one way or another @xcite .",
    "one of the issues that has seen a more spectacular development in this field is the application of chiral dynamics to study the interaction of hadrons .",
    "the chiral lagrangians @xcite represent an effective approach to qcd at low energies and use the observable mesons and baryons as degrees of freedom , which makes also comparison of prediction with experiment an easy task .",
    "however , the perturbation theory made these lagrangians , chiral perturbation theory , @xmath6 , in spite of its spectacular success in dealing with many hadron properties , certainly could not succeed on the problem of spectroscopy , for the simple reason that resonances correspond to poles in the scattering amplitudes but poles can not be reached in a perturbative expansion .",
    "the problem was solved with the advent of the chiral unitary approach @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "what is found in the chiral unitary approach is that many known mesons and baryons can be explained as composite states of meson - meson or meson - baryon dynamically generated by the interaction provided by the chiral lagrangians .",
    "an important step forward has been given in recent work on three body systems that show that also many other states can be understood as molecules of two mesons and a baryon @xcite or three mesons @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges in this field is to determine from the experimental data the nature of the states as whether they are composite of other stable particles or something different .",
    "the pioneer in this work was weinberg in his well known paper determining that the deuteron was a composite state ( bound state from the potential ) of a proton and a neutron @xcite .",
    "more work on this issue has been done in @xcite .",
    "the generalization of weinberg s work to coupled channels was done in @xcite and a different derivation is also done in @xcite . yet , all the work has been done for @xmath0-waves .",
    "the generalization of the theorem to higher partial waves is one of the contents of the present work .",
    "the theorem comes as a byproduct of a thorough study of the relationship of scattering amplitudes in momentum space to wave functions in coordinate space and the meaning of the residues at the poles , or couplings of states to the pair of interacting hadrons .",
    "the same problem was studied for just @xmath0-waves in @xcite , for bound states , and in @xcite for resonant states . in the present paper",
    "we generalize this work to any partial wave and both for bound states and states in the continuum . as an application of some of the results obtained we justify that the @xmath1 meson is not a composite state of @xmath2 but something else .",
    "this is the commonly accepted idea about the nature of the @xmath1 , which qualifies as one of the typical @xmath4 states , and has been supported by large @xmath7 studies done in @xcite .",
    "the novelty is that we reach the conclusion from just the experimental data .",
    "the work contains novel results and is rather practical concerning applications and clarity in the derivation and in the relationship of different magnitudes .",
    "we want to study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a bound state generated by the interaction of two particles of masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a generic @xmath10-wave .",
    "as done in @xcite we choose as the potential v a separable function in momentum space with the modulating factor being a step function , @xmath11 . a generalization to other types of potential",
    "is done in @xcite , but the basic results are the same .    thus , our potential , this time projected in a generic @xmath10-wave , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a cutoff in the momentum space .",
    "let the hamiltonian of the system be @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the free hamiltonian .",
    "the nonrelativistic lippmann - schwinger equation can be written as @xmath16 and also as @xmath17    considering the second term of the series given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lipp - schw ] ) and substituting the expression of the potential , we can write @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reduced mass of the two interacting particles of masses @xmath20 and @xmath21 and we have used the normalization @xmath22 using the expression of the legendre functions in terms of the spherical harmonics , @xmath23 and their normalization condition , @xmath24 eq .",
    "( [ eq : tsecond ] ) becomes @xmath25 repeating the procedure for the other terms of the expression of the lippmann - schwinger equation , leads to the expression of the scattering amplitude @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 we can see that the factor @xmath29 does not appear in the equation for @xmath30 .    we can also see that @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) does not contain @xmath32 , which is now absorbed into the definition of the loop function @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : loop ] ) .",

    "let @xmath50 be the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pole2 ] ) .",
    "since we are dealing with a bound state , its wave function will satisfy the normalization condition @xmath51 we can now substitute the expression of the wave function ( [ eq : wav4 ] ) in the above equation , @xmath52    taking into account the normalization in eq .",

    "( [ eq : prob3 ] ) is relevant for our purposes . by construction ,",
    "the left - hand side is the probability that the bound state found couples to the hadron - hadron component under consideration .",
    "we shall see in the following sections that , when we have several interacting hadron - hadron pairs , it is replaced by a sum over the different coupled channels , and each of the terms indicates the probability to find each hadron - hadron pair in the wave function .",
    "yet , it could be that a physical state couples not only to hadron - hadron pairs , but also to a different component of non molecular type , say @xmath54 for mesons or @xmath5 for baryons .",
    "one example of this can be found in studies with the chiral bag model @xcite where the @xmath55 has a big @xmath5 component and a smaller @xmath56 one . in this case",
    "the normalization would be given by @xmath57 and then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the genuine component of the state ( the @xmath5 in the bag model of @xcite ) .",
    "this is the statement of the compositeness condition of weinberg , although derived and formulated in a different way .",
    "the idea is that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob3 ] ) represents the probability to find the hadron - hadron component in the wave function , and its diversion from unity is the probability to find some other components which have not been considered if one has neglected important channels of the more general coupled channels problem . yet",
    ", the theorem can be stated in a more practical way as we show in the following section .",
    "now we want to use the other form of the lippmann - schwinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lipp - schw2 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] finding the parameters @xmath241 which lead to the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "as expected , the data at higher energies improve .",
    "as we can see , the values obtained for @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 do not differ much from those that would be provided by the chiral lagrangians .",
    "now we proceed as before to find the pole and the new couplings , this time for both the @xmath179 and @xmath3 channels .",
    "we obtain @xmath242 using these values and the value of @xmath243 , with @xmath244 , we find @xmath245 from where it follows @xmath246 note that the @xmath3 channel is not open and hence @xmath237 is evaluated in the first riemann sheet .",
    "we can also evaluate @xmath247 the results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modcc ] ) lead us to the conclusion that the value of @xmath223 for the @xmath179 channel is essentially unaffected by the inclusion of the @xmath3 channel . at the same time",
    "the exercise has served to get a feeling of the amount of @xmath3 present in the @xmath1 meson wave function : we found a negligible fraction of about @xmath248 .",
    "thus , the three tests carried in the work lead us to conclude that the @xmath1 meson is mostly a dynamical structure with only a small component of @xmath179 in its wave function and a negligible one of @xmath3 .",
    "we have made an analytical study of the scattering matrix and wave function for the case of the interaction of a pair of hadrons in coupled channels . for this purpose",
    "we have followed closely the formalism developed in the chiral unitary approach but using quantum mechanics and making all derivations in detail .",
    "the study has been done for all partial waves , generalizing work done before for @xmath0-waves .",
    "the study has been done both for bound states and for scattering states .",
    "we find novel and interesting relations between the couplings of bound states and resonances to the hadron - hadron channels and the wave function at the origin .",
    "of particular value are the sum rules obtained which allow us to determine the probability to find a certain hadron - hadron component in the wave function .",
    "in particular , when the sum of these probabilities is unity we can say that this state is a composite state of hadron - hadron . when the sum differs from unity",
    "this difference measures the probability to find a genuine component in the wave function of non hadron - hadron molecular nature . in this sense",
    "we extend the rule of compositeness condition derived by weinberg for @xmath0-waves , one channel and small binding energies , to any partial wave , several coupled channels , bound states and resonances . as a test we have applied these findings to the rho meson , determining that it is largely a genuine state , with a small component of @xmath2 and one much smaller of @xmath3 , in agreement with other findings based on theoretical studies of the large @xmath7 dependence of the @xmath34-wave @xmath2 amplitude .",
