    "interaction in a low - dimensional system does not merely result in strong renormalization of physical quantities , but can in many cases drive the system into completely new phases with peculiar properties . for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field , the interaction effects are especially important because of landau level quantization .",
    "when electrons are entirely restricted to the lowest landau level by a large magnetic field , electron - electron interaction completely dominates the properties of the system as the electron kinetic energy is quenched to an unimportant constant .",
    "one of the most interesting phenomena in this strongly - correlated system is the quantum hall ( qh ) effect , which has attracted a great deal of experimental and theoretical interest during the last fifteen years@xcite .",
    "recent advances in materials growth techniques have made it possible to fabricate high - quality double - layer two - dimensional electron systems with the electrons confined to two parallel planes separated by a distance comparable to that between electrons within a plane . with the introduction of this layer degree of freedom ,",
    "many qualitatively new effects due entirely to interlayer correlations appear@xcite .",
    "many new qh phases in double - layer systems become real possibilities because of the increased degree of freedom and the complicated interplay among interlayer tunneling energy , zeeman energy , and electron - electron coulomb interaction energy .    in this paper",
    ", we present the details of our earlier theoretical investigations@xcite of the possible qh phases in a double - layer system at a _ total _ landau level filling factor @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is a filling factor at which an isolated single layer system forms a fully spin polarized incompressible qh state ( _ e.g .",
    "@xmath4 , etc .",
    "_ ) we will discuss three distinct ground states , and the nature of the zero or finite temperature transitions / crossovers between them :    * a fully polarized ferromagnetic ( fpf ) qh state in which the spins in each layer are aligned parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this state is adiabatically connected to the ground state of well separated layers , each forming a polarized qh state at filling fraction @xmath1 .",
    "we will denote this fpf state also as the fm ( for `` ferromagnetic '' ) state . *",
    "a spin singlet ( ss ) state , which can be visualized crudely as consisting of singlet pairs of electrons in opposite layers .",
    "alternatively , at @xmath2 , we will discuss the hartree - fock picture of spin up and spin down electrons fully occupying single - particle states which are symmetric in the layer `` pseudospin '' index ; hence the singlet state will also be referred to as sym . in the limit of a vanishing tunneling matrix element between the layers ,",
    "this state is simply the pseudospin polarized state of refs   for both spin up and spin down electrons separately . throughout",
    ", we will consider the case of a non - vanishing tunneling matrix element : in this case the pseudospin polarization is chosen by the phase of the tunneling amplitude , and not spontaneously .",
    "none of the phase transitions we consider here require a vanishing tunneling matrix element ; on the contrary , changes in the value of the tunneling matrix element can drive the quantum transitions . *",
    "a canted state ( c ) in which the average spin moments in the layers have an antiferromagnetic correlation in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , and a ferromagnetic correlation parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic moments can vary continuously at zero temperature as parameters are varied .",
    "the planar antiferromagnetic ordering breaks spin rotation symmetry about the magnetic field axis : as a consequence there is a gapless , linearly dispersing , goldstone collective mode in its excitation spectrum and a kosterlitz - thouless transition at a finite temperature .",
    "the c phase is the canted antiferromagnetic phase ( caf ) discussed in our earlier short publications @xcite .",
    "we will use two distinct and complementary approaches to understand these phases .",
    "the first is a mean - field hartree - fock calculation : this applies only for integer values of @xmath1 , but has the advantage of working with a precise microscopic hamiltonian involving only parameters which are directly known experimentally .",
    "the second is a phenomenological , quantum field - theoretic formulation which applies for general @xmath1 , and allows us to more precisely understand the consequences of thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "we will now discuss some of the results of these two approaches in turn .    in the hartree - fock approximation@xcite , we are able to show that the canted antiferromagnetic ( c ) phase is the energetically favored ground state for @xmath5 at intermediate layer separations for systems with small zeeman energy , and that the phase transitions from the c to the fm or sym phases are continuous .",
    "we evaluate at @xmath5 the intersubband spin density wave ( sdw ) dispersions of all phases in the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation @xcite and show that , as the precursor of the phase transitions , the collective intersubband sdw mode softens at the phase boundaries of the fm and sym phases to the c phase .",
    "the sdw becomes the linearly dispersing goldstone mode in the c phase , and the temperature of the kosterlitz - thouless transition is obtained by evaluating its effective spin - stiffness in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "in addition we present results on the stability energetics of the various phases , the antiferromagnetic order parameter , the phase diagram , the collective intersubband sdw excitation dispersions , and the specific heat .",
    "the @xmath5 hartree - fock results may also be qualitatively applicable to the case of @xmath6 if the landau level mixing is ignored ( the landau level mixing may not be negligible at @xmath6 , though . ) on the other hand , the situation at @xmath7 is very different from the situation at @xmath5 , since the inter - landau level excitation energies are comparable to the cyclotron energy ; our results do not apply at @xmath7 .",
    "the microscopic hartree - fock analysis obviously does not apply to a situation where the average filling factor @xmath1 in each layer is fractional ( e.g. @xmath8 ) with each isolated layer supporting a spin polarized laughlin fractional qhe state ; such a many - body state will not appear in any mean - field decoupling of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , an essential property of the phases we are discussing is that they all have a gap towards charged excitations , and the transitions between them are driven by changes in the nature of the mean spin polarizations , and of the spin excitations .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to develop a more general effective theory which focuses on the spin excitations alone .",
    "we will present such a theory in section  [ nls ] : it turns out to be the @xmath9 quantum non - linear sigma model in the presence of a magnetic field . for the case @xmath5",
    ", we are able to use our earlier hartree - fock computations to precisely obtain all the renormalized parameters which universally determine the low temperature properties of the non - linear sigma model ; for other values of @xmath1 , including the fractional cases , these parameters remain as phenomenological inputs",
    ". we will present the phase diagram of the sigma model , and describe the nature of the finite temperature crossovers above the various phases in some details .",
    "in particular , we will obtain explicit predictions for the temperature dependence of the line shape of the inelastic light scattering spectrum .",
    "we note that our findings from the two approaches are consistent with recent inelastic light scattering measurement@xcite , where a remarkable ( and temperature dependent ) softening of the long wavelength intersubband sdw mode in a @xmath5 double - layer system is observed .",
    "we hope that our other explicit theoretical results may be tested in future experiments .",
    "the experimental situation will be discussed in section  [ exp ] .",

    "comparison of our theory with recent light scattering experiments is discussed in section [ exp ] .",
    "a short summary in section [ sum ] concludes this paper .",
    "we note that the readers who are interested only in microscopic hartree - fock theory could skip section [ nls ] , and the readers who are interested only in our long wavelength effective field theory could skip section  [ hft ] .",
    "we have taken care in writing the two parts of our work , namely the microscopic hartree - fock calculation for @xmath5 ( section [ hft ] ) and the non - linear @xmath10 model description for @xmath3 ( section [ nls ] ) as two separate self - contained pieces which can be read reasonably independent of each other if so desired .",
    "we begin by writing down the explicit microscopic hamiltonian of a double layer quantum hall system .    within the lowest landau level ,",
    "the single particle eigenstates may be denoted by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the intra - landau - level index in the lowest landau level , @xmath13 is the pseudospin index which labels the symmetric and antisymmetric subbands , and the spin index @xmath14 labels @xmath15 and @xmath16 spins.@xcite the hamiltonian of the double - layer system is @xmath17 where the non - interacting hamiltonian is @xmath18 where the pseudospin splitting @xmath19 is the tunneling - induced symmetric - antisymmetric energy separation , the spin splitting @xmath20 is the zeeman energy , and @xmath21 is electron creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "the coulomb interaction hamiltonian @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the area of the system , @xmath25 is the magnetic length .",

    "the following subsections will examine various properties of @xmath31 at @xmath5 by mean - field and rpa - like treatments of the interactions in @xmath22 .      in this subsection , we investigate the ground state properties of @xmath31 , and obtain the three phases discussed in the introduction . performing hartree - fock pairing of ( [ equ : hi ] )",

    "because of the complete landau level degeneracy , the hartree - fock hamiltonian @xmath37 in a uniform state is a @xmath38 matrix , representing the dimension of the subspace associated with the spin and layer degrees of freedom .",

    "in fact , the only quantities to be determined in this self - consistent manner are the two parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which , in turn , uniquely define the eigenstates through eq .",
    "( [ equ : eig1 ] )",

    "one is @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which corresponds to the symmetric ( sym ) state .",
    "another is @xmath60 and @xmath62 , which corresponds to the spin polarized ferromagnetic ( fm ) state .",
    "these two are the spin - ferromagnets ( fm ) or layer pseudospin-`ferromagnets ' @xcite ( sym ) whose existence is naturally expected in the presence of finite zeeman and tunneling energies .",
    "more interesting is that , for @xmath63 , there exists a solution at intermediate interlayer separations with @xmath64 .",
    "as we shall see shortly , this new state possesses a canted antiferromagnetic ordering ( the c phase ) , _ i.e. _ an interlayer inplane antiferromagnetic spin ordering with the inplane spin magnetic moment in each layer being equal in magnitude and opposite of each other .",
    "the energies of these different states are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the energetically favored ground state is the sym state at small interlayer separations , the c state at intermediate separations , and the fm state at large interlayer separations .",
    "the @xmath5 double - layer qh system thus undergoes two quantum phase transitions as the layer separation is increased from @xmath65 to @xmath66 at a fixed magnetic field .    to show the antiferromagnetic spin correlations , we rearrange the eigenstates as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , electron spin configurations in the left ( right ) layer in the eigenstate @xmath40 , are @xmath69 , and satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "we immediately obtain the canted antiferromagnetic spin order as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the electron spin operator in the left ( right ) layer , and @xmath73 denotes the spin alignment direction within the two dimensional plane .",
    "this canted interlayer antiferromagnetic spin ordering is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] .",
    "note that the total spin magnetic moment still points in the direction of the magnetic field as required by symmetry .",
    "it is obvious that this antiferromagnetic order breaks the @xmath74 symmetry associated with the spin - rotational invariance of the system .",
    "its consequences on the low temperature thermodynamic properties will be discussed later .",
    "the numerical result of this order parameter @xmath75 is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "one can see that when zeeman energy @xmath20 is increased , the range of the layer separations where the canted antiferromagnetic state exists shrinks in favor of the ferromagnetic state , as the zeeman energy obviously favors the spin polarized state .",

    "we have studied the ground state properties of @xmath5 double - layer qh systems in a mean - field hartree - fock approximation and showed the existence of three stable qh phases .",
    "the most interesting observation is the existence of a canted antiferromagnetic phase , with a broken spin rotation symmetry , in between the symmetric and the ferromagnetic phases .      in this section ,",
    "we study collective intersubband sdw spectrum of @xmath5 double - layer qh systems in the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation.@xcite these excitations involve flipping both spin and pseudospin of the electron and are the lowest energy excitations at @xmath5 .",
    "the phase instability is studied by investigating the softening of the collective intersubband sdw excitations .",
    "the results obtained in this section are in complete quantitative agreement with the results obtained from the ground state studies in the previous section , as , of course , they should be if the calculations are done correctly .    in the absence of interaction , the two branches of the intersubband sdw excitations which correspond to transitions @xmath83 and @xmath84 have excitation energies @xmath85 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are interlayer tunneling and zeeman energies , respectively .",
    "interaction renormalizes the excitation energies in two ways .",
    "one is a self - energy correction to the polarizability due to the loss of exchange energy when an electron is excited to a higher but empty level , which raises the excitation energies .",
    "the other is the vertex correction to the polarizability due to an excitonic attraction between the electron excited to the higher level and the hole it leaves behind , which lowers the excitation energies . in diagrammatic perturbation theories , the effect of the exchange energy on the excitation energies is accounted for by including the corresponding self - energy in electron greens functions , and the effect of the excitonic attraction is represented by vertex corrections .",
    "the self - energy and the vertex correction must be consistent with each other obeying the ward identity . the direct hartree term does not influence the sdw excitations because coulomb interaction is spin - rotationally invariant .",
    "since the coulomb interaction potentials are subband - index dependent , they may introduce mode - coupling between the two branches of the intersubband sdw excitations .",
    "this mode - coupling pushes down the frequency of the low - lying excitation and hence helps mode softening .    the intersubband sdw excitation spectra",

    "@xmath92 is evaluated in the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation , @xcite which we adapt to double - layer systems and , for simplicity , we ignore all the higher landau levels . as argued earlier , this should be a good approximation for our problem . in this approximation ,",

    "this time - dependent hartree - fock approximation , therefore , corresponds to solving the vertex equation shown in fig.[fig4 ] , where the electron propagators are the self - consistent hartree - fock green s functions obtained from the mean - field approximation discussed in the previous section .",

    "mode coupling , which pushes down @xmath131 and hence helps mode softening , is most visible at @xmath132 . at zero layer separation , mode - coupling disappears , and we recover previously known results.@xcite in fig .",

    "the important thing to be noticed is that the long wavelength collective excitations are gapped in both the symmetric phase and the spin polarized phase .",

    "we see that @xmath134 indeed softens when approaching the phase boundaries from both the symmetric phase and the spin polarized phase , and remains zero inside the canted antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the canted antiferromagnetic order parameter , calculated in the previous section , is also shown in fig.[fig8 ] for comparison purpose .",
    "we notice that the phase boundaries determined from these two independent approaches agree completely , as shown in the figure .",
    "the softening of the collective mode and the appearance of the antiferromagnetic order parameter implies that we have discovered a quantum phase transition in double - layer qh systems .    in fig.[fig7 ] , the collective intersubband sdw dispersions in the canted antiferromagnetic qh state are shown .",
    "the first thing to be noticed is that the lower energy branch @xmath131 is a gapless mode .",
    "the existence of such a gapless goldstone mode is due directly to the canted antiferromagnetic spin ordering which spontaneously breaks the spin - rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this goldstone mode is found to be linear in the long wavelength limit , consistent with the fact that it describes antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the existence of the gapless excitation in the canted antiferromagnetic phase implies that some thermodynamic quantities , such as specific heat , have power - law temperature dependence in the canted antiferromagnetic phase in contrast to their exponential temperature dependence in the normal ( symmetric or ferromagnetic ) phases .",

    "the boundary between the spin polarized ( fm ) phase and the canted antiferromagnetic ( c ) phase is found to satisfy @xmath138 the simplicity of eqns .",
    "( [ equ : bd1 ] ) and ( [ equ : bd2 ] ) makes the phase diagram easy to construct .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the phase boundaries are determined by only three energy scales @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath139 in spite of the fact that the hamiltonian is determined by four independent energy scales @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath140 , of which the inter- and intra - layer interactions @xmath140 are in fact continuous functions of wavelength @xmath141 .",
    "this unexpected dependence of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] ) on just three energy scales which are entirely determined by the magnetic field , the sample parameters ( i.e. inter - layer separation , well width , etc . ) , and the tunneling strength , is a specific result of the hartree - fock approximation .",

    "we emphasize that the kosterlitz - thouless transition discussed here is present even in the presence of interlayer tunneling ( in fact , the presence of finite interlayer tunneling is essential to stabilize the canted antiferromagnetic phase , as described in the last two sections ) , unlike the case associated with the pseudospin transition @xcite at @xmath163 ( @xmath164 odd integers ) where interlayer tunneling suppresses kosterlitz - thouless transition .    below the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature , the specific heat in the antiferromagnetic phase has qualitatively different temperature dependence from those of the normal quantum hall phases .",
    "this is of practical significance since it is possible to experimentally measure the specific heat of quantum hall systems.@xcite at low temperatures , the main contribution to the specific heat comes from long wavelength low energy intersubband sdws . with their dispersions calculated in each of the quantum hall phases , the heat capacity is easily obtained : @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the energy of the low - lying intersubband sdw excitation and @xmath167 is its bose occupation factor .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig34 ] .",
    "it is clear that the specific heat has an activated behavior in the normal quantum hall phases because of the existence of excitation gap in its spin wave spectra , and a quadratic power - law temperature dependence in the canted antiferromagnetic phase because of the existence of the linear goldstone mode in the symmetry broken phase .",
    "the spin stiffness goes to zero discontinuously at @xmath168 , and for @xmath169 we have the usual disordered @xmath170@xmath171 phase of the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",

    "generically , these phases separated by phase boundaries representing second - order quantum transitions .",
    "however , there are also special quantum multicritical points in figs  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig21 ] whose physical significance we will now discuss .",
    "the first quantum multicritical point is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where the fm , c and sym phases come together at a single point on the abscissa corresponding to vanishing interlayer separation ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is easily noted from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that this quantum multicritical point is in fact defined by @xmath172 which is equivalent to the conditions @xmath173 using the definition of @xmath140 given immediately following eq .",
    "( [ equ : hi ] ) in section [ grou ] .",
    "the simple physical reason for the vanishing of @xmath174 along the @xmath65 line is that the intra- and interlayer coulomb interactions are identical in the limit of vanishing interlayer separation @xmath145 .",
    "note also that the vanishing of @xmath175 ( and consequently of @xmath139 ) pushes the quantum multicritical point to an infinite value of the abscissa ( @xmath176 ) in the scaled universal diagram given in fig .",
    "[ fig21] in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] the two phase boundaries separating the three phases approach each other asymptotically as @xmath176 and @xmath177 at the multicritical point .",
    "note that the condition @xmath178 for the quantum multicritical point is a particularly interesting criterion because , in the absence of our predicted canted antiferromagnetic phase ( i.e. if the @xmath5 double - layer qh systems allowed only the ferromagnetic and the symmetric phases , as was assumed in the literature before our work ) , the condition of the equality of the zeeman splitting and the symmetric - antisymmetric gap ( i.e. @xmath178 ) is precisely the single particle _",
    "level crossing _",
    "criterion where , at @xmath5 , one would make a transition from the ferromagnetic phases where the two up - spin symmetric and antisymmetric levels are occupied and the down - spin levels are empty for @xmath81 to the symmetric ( spin singlet ) phase where the spin - up and spin - down symmetric subbands are occupied ( and the antisymmetric levels are empty ) for @xmath63 .",
    "what our theory definitely predicts is that such a simplistic one particle level crossing picture ( which appears to be obvious intuitively ) _ does not occur _ in a double - layer qh system at @xmath5 instead coulomb interaction breaks the @xmath179 spin rotational symmetry and drives the system into an intervening antiferromagnetic phase where spin and pseudospin levels are intrinsically mixed .",
    "the fact that the intuitively expected level crossing phenomenon ( at @xmath178 ) has never been observed @xcite in a @xmath5 double - layer qh system in spite of systematic efforts @xcite is , in our opinion , rather strong indirect evidence in support of our phase diagram .",
    "the second multicritical point becomes apparent only in the universal phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] ( and can be inferred implicitly from the trend that can be seen in the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "its existence is a consequence of the intriguing finding that our antiferromagnetic state , in fact , persists all the way to @xmath180 ( as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] where a finite region of the antiferromagnetic state exists along the @xmath180 line ) where the spin - polarized ferromagnetic phase no longer exists , and the antiferromagnetic phase is separated from the spin singlet phase by a multicritical point ( m ) defined by the condition @xmath181 thus the critical line defining the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and the symmetric phases for @xmath182 ends at a critical point ( m ) for @xmath180 .",
    "it is evident that in the absence of any zeeman energy ( @xmath180 ) the spin magnetic moment in each layer lies completely in the 2d plane of the electron gas where they must be equal and opposite in the two layers .",
    "therefore , the @xmath180 antiferromagnetic phase of fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] is _ not _ a _ canted _ phase , but is a purely nel phase ( n ) ; indeed the hamiltonian has full @xmath179 spin rotation symmetry for @xmath183 , and spin moments in the n phase can point in any two anti - parallel directions .",
    "the n , c , and sym phases meet at the multicritical point m. this multicritical point will take on special significance in our effective field theoretical formulation in the next section .",
    "let us also note that the existence of this purely nel qh antiferromagnet at @xmath5 double - layer system may not be just a theoretical curiosity because it is possible to obtain vanishing zeeman splitting in a gaas double - layer system in a finite magnetic field situation by applying external pressure which under suitable conditions could lead to the vanishing of the effective gyromagnetic ratio ( the @xmath184-factor ) due to band structure effects .      before concluding this section , and going on to the effective field theoretic description of the double - layer qh system",
    ", we will discuss the relationship of our results to some earlier work on double layer systems .",
    "we will also use this opportunity to comment on the validity of the hartree fock approximation in our and earlier work .",
    "most earlier studies,@xcite however , have focused on @xmath137 ( with some work@xcite on @xmath185 ) .",
    "although the @xmath137 and the @xmath5 qh systems exhibit some similarities such as the softening of their low energy collective excitations under certain conditions , there are important distinctions between them . at @xmath137 , the spin degree of freedom is normally frozen out by the external magnetic field .",
    "the relevant low energy excitations in the @xmath137 qh state are therefore intersubband charge - density - wave excitations , and the properties of the system are determined by the interplay between interlayer tunneling energy and coulomb interaction energy . in this sense , the @xmath137 system is in fact a single - layer system with a layer pseudospin - dependent interaction.@xcite at @xmath5 , both the spin degree of freedom and the layer degree of freedom are relevant , and the low energy excitations are intersubband sdw excitations .",
    "consequently , the properties of the system are determined by the interplay among tunneling energy , zeeman energy , and coulomb interaction energy . because of the increased degree of freedom , the system has more ways to optimize the total energy , and new states which are not possible at @xmath137 become possible at @xmath5 . the symmetric qh state is energetically favored at small layer separations because it optimizes the tunneling energy ; the spin polarized qh state is favored at large layer separations because it optimizes the coulomb interaction energy ; the canted antiferromagnetic state is energetically favored at intermediate layer separations .",
    "the reason for this is that the canted antiferromagnetic state tends to simultaneously optimize both the tunneling energy and the coulomb interaction energy , which prevails at intermediate layer separations where the tunneling energy and the coulomb interaction energy are equally important .",
    "both the canted antiferromagnetic state and the symmetric state exist only for systems with small enough zeeman energy , as the zeeman energy clearly favors the spin polarized state .",
    "another important distinction between the @xmath137 systems and the @xmath5 systems is that although at @xmath137 the mode softening destroys the qh effect@xcite , and there is no reliable description of the electronic state in the non - qh phase because beyond the critical layer separation the system becomes effectively a pair of isolated layers with compressible half - filled landau level states ; in contrast , at @xmath5 , the qh effect prevails at all phases because there is always a charge gap in both layers ( even as @xmath186 ) , and we have good understanding of the ground state and the low energy excitations in each phase due to the existence of incompressible filled landau levels . nevertheless , the mode softening and the associated phase transitions at @xmath5 are likely to be observable through inelastic light scattering experiments@xcite and thermodynamic measurements .    our work has studied @xmath5 double - layer systems by numerically solving the self - consistent mean - field equations@xcite , and obtained collective excitation dispersions using many - body diagrammatic techniques . @xcite both approaches are , however , based on the hartree - fock approximation . in single - layer integer qh systems ,",
    "calculations @xcite in the hartree - fock approximation agree well with experiments.@xcite in double - layer systems , the hartree - fock approximation is less accurate because coulomb interaction potential is layer - index dependent .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the hartree - fock approximation remains a reasonably good description for a double - layer system at @xmath5 , since the hartree - fock ground state , which is non - degenerate and separated in energy from higher levels , is a good approximation for the real many - body ground state at @xmath5 due to the existence of incompressible filled landau level states with charge excitation gaps at any layer separations .",
    "we want to especially emphasize the difference in the validity of the hartree - fock approximation between @xmath137 and @xmath5 .",
    "the approximation is valid at @xmath137 only at small layer separations and fails completely beyond a critical layer separation where the system becomes effectively a pair of isolated layers with compressible half - filled landau level state in each layer . at @xmath5 ,",
    "incompressible states with filled landau levels exist at any layer separations .",
    "in particular , there is still one filled landau level in each layer at @xmath66 .",
    "this fact , namely the existence of an incompressible energy gap at all layer separations , ensures that the hartree - fock approximation , upon which our calculations are based , is a reasonable formalism at @xmath5 regardless of the value of the layer separation .",
    "the hartree - fock analysis used in the previous sections has the advantage of working with a realistic microscopic hamiltonian and of making definite quantitative predictions for experimental observables in realistic samples . in this section",
    ", we will present an alternative analysis based upon a continuum effective quantum field theory for the low - lying spin excitations of a double layer quantum hall system .",
    "we will find that the global phase diagrams obtained in the two approaches are very similar , and are , in fact , topologically identical , and that detailed additional predictions for the temperature dependence of various observables can be made by a combination of the two methods . in particular , some advantages offered by the continuum approach are :    * it will become clear from the analysis below that there are two basic ingredients necessary to obtain the phases of fig  [ fig21 ] : two well separated layers form fully polarized ferromagnets with a gap towards charged excitations ( i.e. an incompressible qh effect gap ) , and the primary coupling between the layers is an antiferromagnetic exchange ( i.e. a superexchange ) interaction . as such , we expect a similar phase diagram to apply not only at filling @xmath187 , but also at any @xmath188 , where @xmath1 is any filling fraction where a single layer has a charge gap , and is fully polarized . in particular , this criterion is satisfied at @xmath189 , @xmath164 an odd integer , where each layer forms a polarized laughlin fractional quantum hall state .",
    "the hartree - fock analysis clearly can not be applied for @xmath190 , as the single layer charge gap appears only after inclusion of the non - trivial correlations implicit in the laughlin state .",
    "* the hartree - fock theory significantly overestimates the energy of the spin - unpolarized symmetric ( sym ) or the spin singlet ( ss ) state , as we will refer to it in this section .",
    "spin up and spin down electrons are simply placed into the same orbitals which are symmetric in the layer index .",
    "this is costly in coulomb energy as there are no correlations in the layer positions of the up and down spin electrons .",
    "it is clearly more advantageous to form a spin singlet states between electrons which are localized in opposite layers .",
    "the non - linear sigma model continuum field theory to be discussed below does this in a natural way . from now on in this section we refer to this symmetric or the spin singlet phase as the ss to emphasize its correlated singlet nature . *",
    "a number of quantum - critical points have been uncovered in the hartree - fock analysis .",
    "there is the @xmath191 quantum critical point between the spin singlet ( ss or sym ) and the nel ( n ) phases , and a critical line between the ss and the canted antiferromagnetic ( c ) phases .",
    "our continuum approach will obtain the critical theory for these transitions , and we will find that they have dynamic critical exponents @xcite @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively . there is also a second critical line between the c and the fully spin polarized ferromagnetic ( fm ) phases : this transition has @xmath193 and will be discussed only in passing , as the critical theory is rather similar to one of the models discussed in detail in ref  .",
    "* the continuum theory offers not only provides us the zero temperature quantum phase diagram but also a streamlined approach to the study of properties at non - zero temperature , especially in the vicinity of the quantum critical points where effects of fluctuations can not be neglected .",
    "the price one pays is that in general the parameters defining the effective field theory are quantitatively unknown and can only be calculated from a microscopic theory such as the hartree - fock theory of the previous sections .",
    "we motivate our formulation of the continuum theory by consideration of the physics of two well - separated identical layers at @xmath194 .",

    "we will show later that our ignorance of these quantities can be reduced entirely to uncertainties in the value of a certain renormalized energy scale .",

    "we believe this is permissible because of the charge gap .",
    "further  @xcite , as the layers are antiferromagnetically correlated , skyrmions in one layer will be correlated with anti - skyrmions in the other , and this neutralizes the leading contribution of both terms .",
    "this latter argument should continue to hold even if the charge gap were to vanish at a quantum critical point ( the charge gap remains non - zero at the quantum critical points in both our present calculations ) .",
    "note also that no new term is necessary to induce charge transfer between the layers : a hedgehog / anti - hedgehog pair in the two layers corresponds to an event transferring skyrmion number between them .",
    "such spacetime singularities are absent in the strict continuum limit but appear when a short - distance regularization is introduced .    for completeness",
    ", we note that the purely @xmath207 field formulation becomes incomplete for @xmath190 and larger @xmath184 , as the spin zero laughlin quasiparticles can become the lowest energy charged excitations .",
    "these should , in principle , be accounted for by a separate complex scalar field .",

    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig21 ] , and [ fig15 ] for the location of the experimental sample in our theoretical diagram ) .",
    "the experiment @xcite shows two important and striking features : one is that there is a threshold temperature ( @xmath403 ) below which the @xmath401 mode becomes unobservable as it seems to lose all spectral weight , the other feature is that the excitation energy @xmath401 approaches the zeeman energy @xmath20 when the threshold temperature is approached from the above , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath404 .",
    "we argue below that these experimental observations are completely consistent with our predicted kosterlitz - thouless transition in the canted antiferromagnetic phase being the observed experimental transition at @xmath168 .",
    "first , we notice that the @xmath401 mode , which involves a no - spin - flip transition with @xmath405 , has a maximum spectral weight in the symmetric phase , where there are as many spin - up ( down ) empty states as there are spin - up ( down ) electrons .",
    "the spectral weight of the @xmath401 mode is identically zero in the ferromagnetic phase , where all spin - up states are occupied and all empty states are spin - down , and hence the @xmath401 mode ( which does not involve any spin flip ) is forbidden",
    ". the spectral weight of the @xmath401 mode should be nonzero but small in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "this is because the canted antiferromagnetic phase lies between the symmetric phase and the ferromagnetic phase in the phase diagram and its spin - flip dynamics should thus be intermediate .",
    "more over , the canted antiferromagnetic phase is not an eigenstate for either spin or pseudospin , so the small spectral weight of the @xmath401 mode is shared by many allowed transitions , spreading the mode intensity over these transitions and thus making the spectral weight of each transition even smaller .",
    "it is thus plausible to regard the observed disappearance of the @xmath401 mode at the threshold temperature as the transition to the canted antiferromagnetic phase at lower temperatures ( where the spectral intensity for the @xmath401 mode becomes very small ) . above the transition temperature",
    "the system is essentially a disordered planar @xmath170-@xmath171 magnet , and thus behaves like a paramagnet whose sdw properties should be very similar to the paramagnetic spin - singlet symmetric phase .",
    "next , we notice that , in the symmetric phase , the excitation energies of the intersubband sdw triplet have the following simple relationship @xmath406 this expression can be derived explicitly , using either the diagrammatic time - dependent hartree - fock approximation or the single - mode approximation .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the fact that coulomb interaction is spin independent .",
    "the above relationship bears a clear physical meaning : @xmath407 means that @xmath408 , _",
    "i.e. _ mode softening ( see fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "thus , the experimental observation that @xmath401 approaches the zeeman energy as the threshold temperature is reached from above suggests that there is mode softening ( @xmath409 ) at the phase boundary , as predicted by the computations of the @xmath287-dependent peak positions in section  [ nonzerot ] .",
    "finally , we note that the critical temperature ( the threshold temperature ) in the experiment @xcite is @xmath410 , which is reasonably close to our calculated kosterlitz  thouless critical temperature @xmath411 in the hartree - fock theory ( eq . ( [ equ : t1 ] ) ) using the actual experimental sample parameters . @xcite this discrepancy between the experiment and the hartree - fock theory is small when compared with the energy scale of coulomb interaction , which is about @xmath412 in this particular sample .",
    "in addition , quantum fluctuations neglected in the hartree - fock theory should lower the calculated critical temperature and reduce this discrepancy .    from the above discussions , we conclude that our theoretical predictions are consistent with the recent light scattering experimental results .",
    "the most dramatic aspect of the experimental observations which give us confidence in believing that the experiment is really seeing the canted antiferromagnetic phase are ( i ) the unambiguous observation of a mode softening ( _ i.e. _ @xmath407 implying @xmath408 ) ; ( ii ) the observed temperature dependence indicating a finite temperature phase transition ; ( iii ) the location of the experimental sample in our calculated phase diagram and ( iv ) the @xmath407 collapse being observed precisely at @xmath5 .    while the recent inelastic light scattering experiment @xcite provides , in our opinion , rather compelling evidence in favor of there being a finite temperature ( kosterlitz - thouless ) transition in the @xmath5 double - layer system with the low temperature phase being the canted antiferromagnetic phase ( by virtue of the vanishing of the @xmath413 mode at the phase boundary , as discussed in section [ sdw ] of this article ) , a complete verification of our theory awaits further more conclusive and direct experimental measurements , especially heat capacity measurements which should shown ( fig . [ fig34 ] ) power law temperature dependence in the canted phase due to the existence of the goldstone mode and exponential temperature dependence in the two normal phases due to the existence of gaps in the excitation spectra , would be particularly well - suited in verifying our phase diagram .",
    "the direct observation of a gapless goldstone mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) in the inelastic light scattering measurement in the ( low temperature ) canted phase would also be rather definitive in establishing the existence of the canted phase . in this context",
    "we mention that the sdw softening indicating a phase transition to the canted phase is a long wavelength instability , and therefore optical spectroscopy @xcite may also be useful in studying our proposed @xmath5 double - layer phase diagram . both of these proposed direct experiments are fraught with considerable ( experimental ) difficulties , however .",
    "electronic heat capacity measurements in quantum well structures are notoriously difficult by virtue of the extremely small magnitude of the ( 2d ) electronic heat capacity compared with the background ( lattice ) contribution . as for the direct experimental observation of the goldstone mode ,",
    "the experimental inelastic light scattering spectroscopy is severely restricted by the selection rules inherent in the resonant light scattering spectroscopy , and at this stage it is unclear whether the problems associated with the selection rules would allow to directly observe the goldstone mode .",
    "one striking difference between the physics of @xmath5 double - layer system and the corresponding @xmath137 situation is the existence of a charge gap in the @xmath5 case for all values of @xmath145 and @xmath19 : the system is always incompressible ( in all its quantum phases including the canted phase ) . thus the quantized hall effect exists throughout our phase diagram unlike in the corresponding @xmath137 situation .",
    "@xcite the existence / nonexistence of the qh effect , which has been useful in mapping out the @xmath137 double - layer phase diagram @xcite would not work in our problem in a direct sense .",
    "we do , however , speculate that the activation energy ( _ i.e. _ the effective value of the incompressible charge gap ) for the @xmath3 double - layer qh effect may very well show observable structure at our calculated phase boundaries even though all the phases ( ferromagnetic , canted , symmetric ) would exhibit @xmath3 qh effect . we suggest systematic experimental investigations of @xmath3 double - layer ( @xmath387 with @xmath414 ) qh activation energies by tuning @xmath415 , and @xmath145 to look for signatures of our proposed zero and finite temperature phase transitions .    in this context",
    "we point out that there is already some experimental evidence @xcite that the naive @xmath178 level crossing in @xmath5 double - layer qh systems does not exist ( as our theory proposes and clearly demonstrates in our calculated phase diagrams ) .",
    "the experimental observation @xcite has been that the naive @xmath5 level crossing phenomenon ( at @xmath178 ) between ferromagnetic and symmetric phases , which would exist in the absence of our intervening canted phase , if it happens at all in double - layer systems , must happen at magnetic fields _ much lower _ than that satisfying @xmath178 condition .",

    "we show that , in addition to the fully polarized state adiabatically connected to the well separated layer state , there are two other double - layer quantum hall phases : the first is a spin singlet , and the second is characterized by a finite interlayer inplane canted antiferromagnetic spin ordering .",

    "in addition to the microscopic @xmath5 hartree - fock theory , we have developed a rather general long wavelength effective field theory for the @xmath3 , where @xmath387 with @xmath164 an odd integer , double - layer system .",
    "the essential inputs for this effective field theory are the existence of charge gaps in the two layers and an effective interlayer antiferromagnetic ( superexchange ) interaction . by mapping the effective action for this problem to that of an @xmath9 quantum nonlinear @xmath10 model",
    ", we have been able to show that the qualitative phase diagram calculated within the hartree - fock theory for @xmath5 is actually generically valid ( topologically ) for any @xmath3 ( with @xmath419 ) double - layer system with the symmetric phase of the hartree - fock calculation being replaced by a highly non - trivial correlated spin singlet phase ( of which the @xmath5 symmetric phase is a rather trivial example ) .",
    "thus , there could be rather non - trivial canted ( and perhaps even nel , if one can apply sufficient external pressure to produce vanishing gyromagnetic ratio ) antiferromagnets at , for example , @xmath420 in a double - layer system , where each single fully spin polarized laughlin state spontaneously develops in - plane antiferromagnetic spin ordering .",
    "observation of the canted or the spin - singlet phase in a @xmath420 double - layer qh system would significantly enrich the many - body strong correlation physics associated with qh systems .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that , although we have confined ourselves in this article to the @xmath384 case , with @xmath164 an odd integer , it is obvious that the physics we are considering here applies , in principle , to all double - layer qh systems with @xmath3 where a single layer at filling @xmath1 forms a fully _ spin polarized _",
    "incompressible qh state with a charge gap .",
    "thus , the same physics as at @xmath5 should apply , in principle , at @xmath6 ( but _ not _ at @xmath421 where the charge gap is the cyclotron gap not @xmath422 . ) in double - layer system . in principle , however , our approximations which neglect all ( orbital ) landau level couplings become progressively worse at higher landau levels . in this respect ,",
    "it is very gratifying that the experimental light scattering measurements @xcite find qualitatively similar ( but quantitatively much suppressed ) behavior at @xmath6 as at @xmath5 , but the @xmath7 situation is qualitatively different .",

    "here we will assess the validity of the mapping from the action @xmath220 in ( [ action1 ] ) to @xmath229 in ( [ action2 ] ) by examining a simple toy model of two spins .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath423 where @xmath424 are two quantum spins of spin @xmath425 .",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath426 is clearly @xmath427 where @xmath428 is an overall constant we shall not be interested in .",
    "let us attempt to obtain this result using the coherent state path integral .",
    "first , we transcribe @xmath232 into the effective action @xmath429 \\label{app1}\\ ] ] where @xmath200 .",
    "notice that this is the analog of the action @xmath220 in ( [ action1 ] ) with only the spatial gradient spin stiffness terms now being absent . now insert the parameterization ( [ nl ] ) into ( [ app1 ] ) , and expand to quadratic order in @xmath218 .",
    "the neglect of terms higher order in @xmath218 is the only approximation being made here .",
    "this gives us the analog of ( [ action1a ] ) @xmath430 \\label{app2}\\ ] ] now we integrate out @xmath218 as described above ( [ action2 ] ) to obtain @xmath431 where recall that the functional integral is over the unit vector field @xmath432 satisfying @xmath433 for all @xmath434 .",
    "this last form of @xmath435 is the effective action for a quantum rotor in a field @xmath436 .",
    "this action is equivalent to the hamiltonian @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the rotor angular momentum operator .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath439 are easily seen to be identical to those of @xmath232 in ( [ app0 ] ) with one simple difference .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath440 now extend over _ all _ non - negative integers .",
    "thus the only effect of dropping terms higher order in @xmath218 in the functional analysis is that the upper bound @xmath441 has disappeared .",
    "this only introduces additional states at relatively high energies and is therefore not expected to be of importance in our study of the low energy properties of @xmath229 .    , edited by r.e .",
