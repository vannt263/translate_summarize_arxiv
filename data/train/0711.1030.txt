    "<S> the nuclear suppression of high transverse momentum @xmath0 hadrons is one of the most striking findings in heavy - ion collision experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been recognized that the suppression can be theoretically described by folding the primary parton spectrum with an energy loss probability distribution which is suitably averaged over the collision geometry . </S>",
    "<S> however , an interesting problem is to what degree the procedure can be inverted , i.e. given a measurement of the suppression factor @xmath1 with arbitrary precision , can the probability distribution of energy loss be extracted in a model - independent way ? in this note , we present a conceptual study of the inversion problem for lhc energies and demonstrate that a measurement of @xmath1 alone is insufficient to determine the distribution , other observables such as @xmath2-hadron correlations must be taken into account .    the nuclear suppression factor @xmath1 , defined as the measured spectrum of high @xmath0 hadrons divided by the value seen in p - p collision scaled with the number of binary collisions is one of the best investigated signatures of jet quenching due to medium induced energy loss @xcite . for pions </S>",
    "<S> , it has been measured at rhic out to 20 gev @xmath0 by the phenix collaboration @xcite . from a theory perspective </S>",
    "<S> , it has been realized that @xmath1 needs to be computed in a probabilistic framework , not only because the energy loss for a given parton may be probabilistic ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. @xcite ) but also because the initial vertex is not known experimentally , thus the averaging over the evolving geometry leads to a probability distribution of energy loss ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. @xcite ) .    combining all probabilistic effects </S>",
    "<S> , the effect of jet energy loss may be cast quite generally into a distribution @xmath3 which describes the probability to lose energy @xmath4 given the initial parton energy @xmath5 and an unknown initial vertex which is averaged over @xcite .    under the assumption that the probability distribution for @xmath6 does not strongly depend on @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , one can reduce the computation to evaluating @xmath7 . the medium - modified perturbative production of hadrons </S>",
    "<S> can then be computed from the ( schematical ) expression    @xmath8    with @xmath9 the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) production cross section for a parton @xmath10 and @xmath11 the fragmentation function with momentum fraction @xmath12 at scale @xmath13 @xcite ( see appendix [ a-1 ] and @xcite for the explicit expression for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e - folding ] ) ) . from this one can compute the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 as    @xmath14    an intriguing question is now if it is possible to invert eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e - folding ] ) with known @xmath1 , assuming full knowledge of parton spectrum and fragmentation function , to determine @xmath15 approximately in a model - independent way .    </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by discretizing the integral over @xmath4 implicit in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e - folding ] ) which results in    @xmath16    where @xmath1 is provided at @xmath17 discrete values of @xmath0 labelled @xmath18 and @xmath15 is probed at @xmath19 discrete values of @xmath4 labelled @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is then the calculated @xmath1 for all pairs @xmath22 assuming the pqcd parton spectrum and fragmentation function are known ( for the explicit expression see appendix [ a-1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e - matrix ] ) can be solved for the vector @xmath20 by inversion of @xmath21 for @xmath23 , i.e. the experimental resolution of @xmath1 determines the available resolution for the energy loss probability density . however , in general this does not guarantee that the result is a probability distribution . especially in the face of experimental and theoretical errors and finite numerical accuracy </S>",
    "<S> the direct matrix inversion may permit negative @xmath20 which have no probabilistic interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , a more promising solution which avoids the above problems is to let @xmath24 and find the vector @xmath25 which minimizes @xmath26 subject to the constraints @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees that the outcome can be interpreted as a probability distribution and since the system of equations is overdetermined for @xmath29 errors on individual points @xmath18 do not have a critical influence on the outcome any more .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath1 for rhic kinematics is very insensitive to the shape of the underlying probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> part of the problem at rhic is that for a steeply falling parton spectrum , even a small energy loss effectively resembles an absorption of the parton . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is some reason to suspect that the inversion problem is badly conditioned . in the following , we study the problem at lhc kinematics where the parton spectrum is harder and larger shifts in parton energy can in principle be probed .    </S>",
    "<S> our setup to test the inversion is as follows : we provide a prediction for @xmath1 at lhc kinematics based on @xcite sampled at 30 or 50 discrete points between 6 gev and 400 gev momentum as input vector @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve for @xmath20 at 10 or 23 discrete points between 0 and 300 gev energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these discrete values , we always provide zero ( no energy loss ) and 2.25 tev ( complete parton absorption ) as possibilities and compute @xmath21 accordingly .    the resulting solution to the vector @xmath20 interpreted as a probability density </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f-1 ] and compared with the ( computed ) input energy loss probability distribution underlying the prediction of @xmath1 in @xcite . while details of the distribution depend on the values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 , the main features of the extracted distribution are rather stable : there is some strength close to zero energy loss , the distribution peaks between 50 and 70 gev energy loss and the strength in the absorption channel ( not seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f-1 ] ) is about 0.35 , i.e. roughly a third of partons is absorbed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the most striking observation is that the distribution found from the numerical inversion does not resemble the input distribution closely .    </S>",
    "<S> one may ask if the extracted probability distribution is able to describe @xmath1 when inserted back into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e - folding ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown for @xmath30 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f-2 ] where we compare the original prediction of @xmath1 with the one recovered from the extracted probability density . as can easily be verified , the results can not be distinguished , i.e. two very different probability distributions yield an indistinguishable @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are thus faced with a rather asymmetric problem  the fact that @xmath1 is rather insensitive to the shape of the probability distribution prevents the extraction of anything but gross features of the distribution given only a measurement of @xmath1 . since in reality </S>",
    "<S> neither the pqcd spectrum of partons nor the fragmentation function is free of uncertainties and since a measured @xmath1 will have experimental errors , the strategy to invert @xmath1 to find the energy loss probability distribution is simply not feasible in practice .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the the uncertainty associated with the knowledge of the pqcd kernel @xmath21 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f-3 ] . here , we solve eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e - matrix ] ) using two different sets of nuclear parton distributions to compute @xmath21 , i.e. the eks98 set @xcite and the npdf set @xcite ( note that the prediction for @xmath1 used as input is based on eks98 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the ( rather small ) uncertainty in the choice of the parton distribution function maps into visible changes in the extracted probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> while gross features and typical energy loss scales are still similar , the differences in detail are substantial .    thus , while experimental data on @xmath1 are valuable in constraining energy loss models , due to the badly conditioned inversion problem @xmath1 per se does not even measure an energy loss probability distribution , much less a density - distribution of matter ( which can only in a model - dependent way be linked to the energy loss distribution ) and even less a single parameter characterizing the density . </S>",
    "<S> turning to other , more differential observables ( such as @xmath2-hadron correlation measurements in which the energy of a quark is known before energy loss @xcite ) is necessary to achieve the first step towards a model - independent extraction of medium properties from hard probes . </S>"
