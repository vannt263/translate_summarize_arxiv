    "probe branes and defect conformal field theories have been widely studied in the context of ads / cft holography @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the classic example is the d3-d5 intersection @xcite where the relative orientation of the d3 and d5 branes is shown in table 1 . in the appropriate limit",
    ", this system becomes @xmath0 bisected by the probe d5 brane with world volume geometry @xmath5 .",
    "the original idea @xcite was that , in a sense , the ads / cft correspondence acts twice .",
    "the near horizon geometry of the d3-d5 system contains two sets of excitations , those of closed iib superstrings occupying @xmath6 , which are dual to @xmath7 supersymmetric yang - mills theory on the @xmath8 boundary of @xmath6 , and open strings connecting the d3 and d5 branes , which are dual to field theory excitations on the @xmath9 boundary of @xmath10 , the latter forming a co - dimension one defect in @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting field theory dual is then @xmath11 supersymmetric yang - mills theory occupying 3 + 1 dimensions and interacting with a field theory living on a 2 + 1-dimensional defect .",
    "the d3-d5 system preserves half of the supersymmetries of the bulk @xmath7 theory and the degrees of freedom which live on the defect are a bi - fundamental hypermultiplet which transforms in the fundamental representation of the bulk gauge group and the fundamental representation of the defect gauge group .",
    "the defect theory reduces the conformal symmetry of @xmath11 yang - mills theory to the @xmath12 conformal symmetry of the defect .",
    "it also reduces the @xmath13 r - symmetry to @xmath14 and the superalgebra from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17    an interesting variant of the d3-d5 system is where the worldvolume gauge fields of the probe d5 brane have a monopole bundle with a quantized u(1 ) magnetic flux .",
    "the geometry of the brane is still @xmath5 and the flux is on the @xmath4 . as depicted in figure [ dbranes2 ] , in the field theory dual , the defect separates 3 + 1-dimensional space - time into regions where the gauge group of @xmath7 yang - mills theory has different ranks , @xmath18 on one side of the defect and @xmath19 on the other side of the defect , with @xmath20 the number of units of dirac monopole flux . in the string theory",
    "this corresponds to the situation where @xmath20 of the n d3 branes end on the worldvolume of a d5 brane .",
    "the low energy action of the d5 brane contains a wess - zumino term proportional to @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the ramond - ramond 4-form carrying the d3 brane charge , and @xmath23 the field strength of the worldvolume gauge field .",
    "the d3 branes intersect the d5 brane on a subvolume which can be linked by a 2-sphere . the first chern class of the gauge field , the integral of @xmath23 over the 2-sphere must be equal to the number of @xmath24 branes which terminate there .",
    "the holographic system with this flux has some interesting new features which have been exploited in holographic constructions of 2 + 1-dimensional physical systems @xcite . in the limits which are taken in holographic theories , the magnetic flux has to be large , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the t hooft coupling of @xmath7 yang - mills theory , in order to have an effect on the geometry of the d5 brane and to be visible in the physics of the holographic dual .",
    "in an interesting recent paper @xcite , nagasaki and yamaguchi showed that the one - point functions of chiral primary operators could be computed for the d3-d5 defect field theory in the limit of large monopole number @xmath20 .",
    "the defect preserves an @xmath14 subgroup of the @xmath13 r - symmetry and , in the defect conformal field theory , an @xmath14 invariant primary operator @xmath27 can have a one - point function @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the conformal dimension of the operator in the bulk and @xmath30 is the distance between @xmath31 and the defect .",
    "the result for the one - point function of the chiral primary operator with conformal dimension @xmath29 in the limit of large @xmath32 @xcite is @xmath33 where @xmath29 must be an even integer and @xmath34 is the unique @xmath14 symmetric spherical harmonic at level @xmath29 .",
    "( see section 2 , equation ( [ sph ] ) ) . in equation ( [ d5onepointfunction ] ) , it is evaluated at @xmath35 , where the @xmath4 has maximum volume .",
    "what is remarkable is that this result is obtained on both the gauge theory and the string theory side . in both cases ,",
    "it is of leading order in the parameter @xmath36 which is assumed to be small on both sides .",
    "it is one of the few instances where the gauge and string theory computations can be compared directly .",
    "moreover , it is a test of the ads / cft correspondence in the presence of probe branes complementary to previous tests which have examined the open d3-d5 string sector in the plane wave bmn limit @xcite @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the bmn limit in the string theory depends on a large angular momentum on @xmath37 whereas , in the present case , it is @xmath20 , the number of d3 branes which end on the d5 brane that is large .",
    "supersymmetric yang - mills theories with gauge group @xmath38 on the left and @xmath39 on the right .",
    "the integer @xmath20 is the number of d3 branes which end on the d5 or d7 brane . in the latter cases ,",
    "@xmath20 should be replaced by @xmath40 or @xmath41.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] +    in this paper , we will extend and elaborate on this interesting result .",
    "in particular , we will extend it to the non - supersymmetric d3-d7 system .",
    "we will consider two different cases , the first with @xmath14 symmetry where the probe brane geometry is @xmath42 and where the worldvolume u(1 ) gauge field of the d7 brane has @xmath43 and @xmath44 units of magnetic flux on the two 2-spheres , and the second with @xmath45 symmetry , where the probe brane geometry has is @xmath1 and the worldvolume gauge fields form a certain instanton bundle on the @xmath2 with instanton number @xmath41 .",
    "the situation on the gauge theory side is again as illustrated in figure [ dbranes2 ] , only in the first case the parameter @xmath20 gets replaced by @xmath46 and in the second case it gets replaced by @xmath41 .",
    "remarkably , even in these non - supersymmetric systems , the one - point functions of chiral primary operators on the string and gauge theory sides agree in the leading order of a large @xmath47 limit of the @xmath48 symmetric system , @xmath49 or the limit of large @xmath50 , with instanton number @xmath51 , in the @xmath45 symmetric system , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unique @xmath54 symmetric spherical harmonic at level @xmath29 .",
    "( see section 4.1.1 ) .",
    "here it is evaluated at @xmath55 where the size of the @xmath2 is maximal .",
    "the second remarkable fact is that a discontinuity in what is meant by chiral primary operator that is expected to occur as one crosses the defect will also turn out to be visible in the supergravity computation . on the gauge theory side ,",
    "it is easily seen .",
    "the yang - mills theory computations which result in ( [ onepointfunction ] ) and ( [ gres0 ] ) are semi - classical , obtained by simply substituting a classical configuration of the scalar fields of the @xmath7 yang - mills theory .",
    "these fields are non - zero only on the side of the defect with @xmath38 gauge group , they vanish on the side with @xmath56 or @xmath57 gauge group .",
    "the yang - mills theory therefore tells us that the leading contribution to the one - point function ( [ onepointfunction ] ) and ( [ gres0 ] ) is nonzero only on the side of the defect where the gauge group is larger ( thus the qualification @xmath58 in that formula ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether this is reflected in the strong coupling , string theory computation .",
    "we shall find that indeed it is .",
    "there is a discontinuity in the leading order of the one - point function as the point crosses the d7 brane , with the value being much smaller on the side of the brane with smaller d3 brane flux .",
    "the d3-d7 system is of interest as a holographic dual of a defect field theory where the degrees of freedom living on the 2 + 1-dimensional defect are fermions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the flat space orientation of the d3 and d7 branes is displayed in table 1 .",
    "this is an @xmath59 configuration and it is not supersymmetric @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in flat space , there is no tachyon in the spectrum of the d3-d7 open strings and the only zero modes are in the ramond sector .",
    "the light degrees of freedom are thus chiral fermions inhabiting the 2 + 1-dimensional overlap of the d3 and d7 worldvolumes .    however , the most straightforward constructions of the d3-d7 system , where the d7 brane worldvolume is either @xmath1 or @xmath60 without fluxes are unstable  @xcite . the systems are non - supersymmetric and the d3 branes and d7 brane repel each other",
    ". the symptoms of the resulting instability are tachyonic modes which violate the breitenholder - freedman bound for fluctuations of the embeddings .",
    "they are stabilized by adding the topological fluxes , the instanton bundle on the @xmath2 when the instanton number is large enough @xcite or dirac monopole bundles on either one or both of the @xmath4 s in @xmath61 , when the flux is large enough @xcite .",
    "this lower bound on the flux is , in the first case , where the instanton number ( which we shall call @xmath41 ) exceeds a number of the order of @xmath62 and , in the second case , where the monopole numbers @xmath43 and/or @xmath44 are of order @xmath63 . in this paper",
    ", we shall be interested in the limits where @xmath64 or @xmath43 and/or @xmath65 as it is in this region where the gauge theory and string theory computations can be compared .    in section 2",
    ", we present the yang - mills theory computation of the one - point function of chiral primary operators in the case where @xmath14 r - symmetry is preserved . in section 3",
    "we present the same computation in supergravity . in section 4",
    "we examine the case where the @xmath45 subgroup of r - symmetry is preserved .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion and conclusions .",
    "we begin with a classical solution of @xmath7 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , where we set the vector and spinor fields to zero , @xmath66 , @xmath35 and look for a solution of the remaining equations for the scalar fields , @xmath67\\right]=0 , \\label{fieldequation1}\\\\ & \\sum_{i=1}^6\\left[\\phi_i,\\nabla\\phi_i\\right]=0 .",

    "the matrices @xmath78 have the following property @xmath79 and hence @xmath80 we will use these equations for computing the classical limit of the one - point function of a chiral primary operator , which we shall define in the next subsection .",
    "the chiral primary operators of @xmath11 yang - mills theory are @xmath81 where the @xmath78 s can be any of the six real scalar fields . here",
    "@xmath29 is an integer which counts the number of fields and it is also equal to the bulk scaling dimension of the operator which does not depend on the coupling constant .",
    "the tensors @xmath82 are symmetric and traceless in the indices @xmath83 and they can be chosen to satisfy an orthogonality relation @xmath84 the indices @xmath85 label different such tensors which are equal in number to the dimension of the totally symmetric and traceless irreducible representation of @xmath13 with @xmath29 indices , @xmath86 . with the normalization in",

    ", we shall follow the notation of reference @xcite . using the same tensor as in ( [ chiralprimary ] ) ,",
    "a spherical harmonic on @xmath37 can be written as @xmath88 where the @xmath89 s are the components of a unit vector coordinate for the embedding of @xmath37 in @xmath90 , @xmath91 equation ( [ tensor ] ) plus the fact that the tensors @xmath92 are traceless and symmetric and the identity @xmath93 where @xmath94 , can easily be used to show that @xmath95 and , remembering that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , we see that @xmath98 are eigenfunctions of the laplacian , @xmath99 , on @xmath37 with eigenvalues @xmath100 .",

    "it is stable when @xmath274 @xcite .",
    "we caution the reader that this is a condition for stability to small fluctuations and it does not rule out the possibility of nonperturbative instabilities .    to facilitate our computation , we rewrite the dirac - born - infeld part of the action in the following way , @xmath275 this identity is valid when the d7 brane metric decomposes into two nonzero @xmath276 blocks which , on the classical solution , become @xmath10 and @xmath2 ( as in equation ( [ d7metric2 ] ) ) .",
    "the metric blocks are therefore denoted @xmath277 and @xmath278 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the gauge field has nonzero components only in the @xmath279 block and it is self - dual with respect to the @xmath279 geometry , @xmath280 we note that , when the metrics of the blocks are set equal to the @xmath10 and @xmath2 metrics plus a perturbation by the supergraviton field @xmath281 which corresponds to the chiral primary operator ( the explicit perturbations are @xmath282 given in equation ( [ fluctuations ] ) ) , they retain their block diagonal form and @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the metric of the unit @xmath2 .",

    "it would thus be easy to find the sub - leading orders of the computation .",
    "on the gauge theory side , on the other hand , the sub - leading orders would require computing perturbation theory in small @xmath26 . in both cases ,",
    "however , one could generate an asymptotic series in @xmath294 .",
    "it could happen that , like the bmn limit @xcite of the string spectrum , such a comparison could fail at a higher order simply due to a non - commutativity of limits problem @xcite .",

    ".    a computation of this kind could be helpful in constructing the quantum field theory on the defect .",
    "the bi - fundamental fields living on the defect should be chiral fermions .",

    "a candidate lagrangian for the fermions is @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the bulk gauge field and its coupling to the defect fermions is fixed by gauge invariance . with a single d3 brane ,",
    "the fermions are doublets of the so(2,1 ) lorentz symmetry and singlets of @xmath14 , so the above are apparently the only marginal operators which contain the defect fermions .",
    "we are also allowed to add operators made only from the bulk fields and comparison with the string theory could be a be a useful guide as to what these operators are .",
    "there is a possibility that they could also be checked by requiring that the resulting theory has conformal symmetry .",
