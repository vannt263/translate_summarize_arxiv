    "the problem of understanding the dynamical content of mesonic scattering amplitudes , with energies ranging from threshold to a few gev , is interesting by itself .",
    "nevertheless , it became especially urgent in recent times , because these amplitudes play important roles in final state interactions which occur after primary weak decays of quarks within @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "decays of heavy mesons are presently object of intense scrutiny and the understanding of patterns observed in dalitz plots require accurate descriptions of both primary weak vertices and hadronic final state interactions@xcite . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the standard treatment of elastic scattering begins with a potential , which is fed into the schrdinger equation . in the elastic regime ,",
    "the potential is real and the dynamical equation yields complex wave - functions , that can be parametrized in terms of phase shifts .",
    "when inelasticities are present , one needs a complex optical potential and the corresponding damped wave - functions can be parametrized by their phase shifts and moduli or inelasticity parameters .",
    "the formulation of the scattering problem for relativistic particles is roughly similar .",
    "dynamics is now described by the bethe - salpeter equation and its _ kernel _ corresponds to the potential . in the case of scattering of two generic particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 , this kernel amounts to the sum of all _ proper _ intermediate diagrams , that is , those which can not be split into two pieces by cutting @xmath5 and @xmath6 propagators only .",
    "similarly to what happens with the potential , real kernels give rise to elastic interactions , whereas inelasticities require complex kernels .    in quantum mechanics , the so called inverse problem , in which one attempts to derive",
    "potentials from scattering amplitudes , has been widely studied and one knows that it does not have unique solutions .",
    "the same holds for the relationship between scattering amplitudes and kernels , in the framework of relativity .",
    "this problem has been discussed long ago by lang@xcite , who has shown that constraints imposed by unitarity on scattering amplitudes can not fix kernels completely . however , in the case of low and medium energy meson - meson scattering , the bethe - salpeter equation can be simplified and there is a window in which an approximate solution to the inverse problem does exist , which we discuss in the sequence . in the last two decades",
    ", this simplification of the bethe - salpeter has been extensively used in the dynamical unitarization of amplitudes and successfully applied to a wide number of problems@xcite .",

    "this equation can be simplified if one assumes that , at low energies , the dependences of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the loop variable @xmath16 can be neglected .",
    "this assumption has been used in ref.@xcite , tested in many instances@xcite , and allows the amplitude to be written as t_xy(s ) = _ xy(s)1 - t_xy(s ) _",

    "following ref.@xcite , we write the regular part of @xmath18 as & & _ xy(s)= _ xy(s)-_xy(0 ) , [ m5 ] where the divergent part is contained in @xmath19 .",
