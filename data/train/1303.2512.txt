    "one of the main goal of the experiments in the large hadron collider(lhc ) , is the search for physics beyond standard model(bsm ) .",
    "the motivations for new physics beyond standard model stems from the large hierarchy of mass scales between the planck and the tev scales which results into the well - known fine tuning problem in connection with the mass of the higgs boson , the only scalar particle in the standard model .",
    "it has been shown that due to large radiative corrections the higgs mass can not be confined within tev scale ( the current estimated value @xmath0 gev ) , unless some unnatural tuning is done order by order in the perturbation theory . among several proposals to address this problem ,",
    "the models with extra spatial dimensions draw lot of attentions . in particular the warped geometry model proposed by randall and sundrum @xcite",
    "has drawn special attention for the following reasons : ( 1 ) it resolves the hierarchy problem without introducing any other intermediate scale in the theory , ( 2 ) the modulus of the extra dimensional model can be stabilized @xcite , and ( 3 ) a warped solution , though not exactly same as rs model , can be found from string theory which as a fundamental theory predicts inevitable existence of extra dimensions @xcite . due to these unique features , experiments in lhc",
    "are designed to explore the signature of these warped extra dimensions through the dileptonic decay of kaluza - klein graviton kk modes present in these models .",
    "+ in this work we propose to study some theoretical constraints of rs model and look for their consistency with the result obtained in lhc so far .",
    "+ we begin with a brief description of rs model .",
    "randall - sundrum scenario @xcite which is defined on a 5-dimensional anti de - sitter space - time with one spatial direction orbifolded on @xmath1 has the following features :    * two flat 3-branes namely hidden / planck brane and visible / standard model brane are located at the two orbifold fixed points .",
    "the brane tension of the standard model / visible brane is negative . *",
    "5-dimensional planck scale is nearly equal to 4-dimensional planck scale . * without introducing any extra scale , other than the planck scale , in the theory one can choose the brane separation modulus @xmath2 to have a value @xmath3 such that the desired warping can be obtained between the two branes from planck scale to tev scale . *",
    "the modulus can be stabilized to the above chosen value by introducing scalar in the bulk @xcite without any further fine tuning .",
    "we first briefly outline the rs model below : + the rs model is charecterized by the non - factorisable background metric , @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath2 is the compactification radius for the extra dimension and @xmath7 is of the order of 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath8 and relates the 5d planck scale @xmath9 to the cosmological constant @xmath10 .",
    "the extra dimensional coordinate is denoted by @xmath11 and ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 following a @xmath1 orbifolding .",
    "two 3-branes are located at the orbifold fixed points @xmath14 .",
    "the standard model fields are residing on the visible brane and only gravity can propagate in the bulk . solving five dimensional einstein s equation and using orbifolded boundary condition , the warped solution for the metric turns out to be , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the visible and planck brane tensions are , @xmath17 . all the dimensional parameters described above are related to the reduced 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath18 as , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , the exponential factor present in the background metric , which is often called warp factor , produces a huge suppression on the planck scale mass parameters and reduced those parameters to tev scale on the visible brane .",
    "thus a scalar mass say mass of higgs is given as , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is higgs mass parameter on the visible brane and @xmath23 is the the cut off scale of the theory , above which new physics beyond standard model is expected to appear . a natural choice for this would be planck or quantum gravity scale beyond which standard model will not be valid .",
    "as argued in @xcite we assumed that @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "this requirement emerges from the fact that @xmath7 , which measures the bulk curvature must be smaller than the planck scale so that the classical solutions for the bulk metric given by rs model is a valid one . alternatively from the view point of string theory it was argued in @xcite that using the expression for d-3 brane tensions and the string scale which in turn is related to @xmath18 through yang - mills gauge coupling , the favoured range of @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that in such models the gravity which propagates in the bulk can be expanded into kk modes as , + @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the kk modes of the graviton on the flat 3-brane and @xmath31 is the wave function for the graviton .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the solution for the graviton wave function is of the form , @xmath32\\label{wfungr}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the bessel functions of order 2 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are constants and @xmath37 is the normalization factor for the wave function .",
    "+ if we now choose a parameter @xmath38 and consider the limit @xmath39 , @xmath40 then applying the continuity condition that the wave function should be continuous at @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( i.e at the two orbifold fixed points ) , it produces @xmath43 and @xmath44 . hence the term with @xmath45",
    "can be ignored in comparison to @xmath46 .",
    "the expression @xmath43 implies that @xmath47 are the roots of the bessel function of the order of 1 and if we plot the @xmath48 vs. @xmath47 , we get the first few values of @xmath47 as follows , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 etc . + as it has been defined earlier that , @xmath52 , we can find the kk mass tower of graviton from this expression , @xmath53 we mentioned earlier that to study the phenomenology of this model the most important parameter is @xmath24 .",
    "hence let us focus on the first kk mass mode of graviton ( i.e @xmath54 ) and slightly reparametrize the expression for @xmath54 , from eq.([mmgr ] ) .",
    "@xmath55 from eq.([physmass ] ) and using @xmath24 , @xmath56 now from eq.([rplanckmass ] ) , the exponential term is very small in comparison to 1 .",
    "hence we obtain , @xmath57 . in eq.([1stmmgr ] ) , we use @xmath57 and take the cut off scale as , @xmath58 , where @xmath9 is the 5-dimensional planck scale and @xmath59 is any constant parameter .",
    "@xmath60 implies that the cut - off scale is the quantum gravity scale @xmath18 , while @xmath61 indicates the appearence of new physics below planck scale .",
    "hence we obtain , @xmath62 if we consider @xmath59 to be @xmath63 i.e the cut - off scale is the 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath9 then values of @xmath54 for different values of @xmath64 varying from @xmath65 are shown in table([t1 ] ) and plotted in figure([atlastheory ] ) .",
    "+    .theoretical values of first kk mass mode of graviton from rs model when @xmath60 , @xmath49 and @xmath66 [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + this indicates that the cut - off of the rs model namely @xmath23 , must be at least two order lower then the planck scale indicating the existence of new physics at a scale of the order of @xmath67 gev .",
    "present estimation of the lower bound on the lightest rs graviton kk mode masses from dilepton events as reported by atlas collaboration is in conflict with the requirement of resolving the gauge hierarchy /fine tuning problem unless the cut - off of the standard model is atleast two order lower than the planck / quantum gravity scale .",
