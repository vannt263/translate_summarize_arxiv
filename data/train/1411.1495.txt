    "heavy ion collisions at ultra relativistic energies might produce a new form of qcd matter characterized by the deconfined state of quarks and gluons ( partons ) @xcite .",
    "measurements of the production of identified particles provide information about the dynamics of this dense matter .",
    "the yield of identified hadrons , their multiplicity distributions , as well as the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra are the basic observables in proton - proton and heavy ion collisions at any energy regime , from a few gev per nucleon to the new ultra - relativistic lhc regime , spanning c.m .",
    "energies of a few tev.@xcite recently , experimental results in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath5 = 2.76 tev in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are also reported by the different groups .",
    "these results might provide another opportunity to investigate the bulk properties of exotic qcd matter , the so - called qgp - hypothesis .",
    "but the exact nature of qgp- hadron phase transition is still plagued by uncertainties.@xcite    our objective in this work is to use a model , known as ` sequential chain model ( scm ) ' , which is different from ` standard ' framework , in interpreting the transverse momenta spectra , some ratio - behaviours , rapidity spectra and the nuclear modification factor of the pions , kaons and antiprotons for @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions at lhc energy @xmath4 = 2.76 tev .",
    "very recently , a question has been raised about the quark - gluon composition of proton.@xcite so , in order to explain the huge amount of heavy ion collision data , we put forward this model which has no qgp - tag and is different from the quark - hypothesis .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief outline of our approach , the scm . in the next section ( section 3 ) the results arrived at",
    "have been presented with table and figures . and",
    "in the last section ( section 4 ) we offer the final remarks and conclusions .",
    "this section is divided by two subsections ( 1 ) the basic model in @xmath2 collision and ( 2 ) subsequent transformation to the @xmath6 collisions .      according to this sequential chain model ( scm ) ,",
    "high energy hadronic interactions boil down , essentially , to the pion - pion interactions ; as the protons are conceived in this model as @xmath7   =   ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 ) , where @xmath10 is a spectator particle needed for the dynamical generation of quantum numbers of the nucleons.@xcite-@xcite    the inclusive cross - section of the @xmath11-meson produced in the @xmath2 collisions at high energies has been calculated by using field theoretical calculations and feynman diagram techniques with the infinite momentum frame approximation method .",
    "the inclusive cross - section is given by the undernoted relation @xcite-@xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalisation factor which will increase as the inelastic cross - section increases and it is different for different energy region and for various collisions .",
    "the terms @xmath15 , @xmath16 [ @xmath17 in equation ( 1 ) represent the transverse momentum , feynman scaling variable respectively .",
    "the @xmath18 in equation ( 2 ) is the square of the c.m .",
    "energy .",
    "@xmath19 of the expression ( 1 ) is the ` constituent rearrangement term ' .",
    "it arises out of the partons inside the proton . at high energy interaction",
    "processes the partons undergo some dissipation losses due to impact and impulses of the projectile on the target .",
    "this term essentially provides a damping term in terms of a power law .",
    "the exponent of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath20 , varies on both the collision process and the specific @xmath15-range .",
    "we have to parametrize this term with the view of two physical points , viz . , the amount of momentum transfer and the contributions from a phase factor arising out of the rearrangement of the constituent partons .",
    "the relation for @xmath20 is to be given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the average number of participating nucleons and @xmath23 values are to be obtained phenomenologically from the fits to the data - points .",
    "similarly , for kaons of any specific variety ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) we have @xmath28 with @xmath29 and for the antiproton production in @xmath30 collision at high energies , the derived expression for inclusive cross - section is @xmath31 with @xmath32      in order to transform the inclusive cross - section from @xmath34 to @xmath35 collisions ( here , @xmath36 stands for @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath37 , as the case may be ) , we use the undernoted relation ; @xcite @xmath38 gives the probability cross - section of collision with ` @xmath39 ' nucleus ( target ) , had all the nucleons of @xmath40 suffered collisions with @xmath39-target . and",
    "@xmath41 has just the same physical meaning , with @xmath40 and @xmath39 replaced .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 is the nucleon(proton)-nucleus(a ) interaction cross - section , @xmath43 is the inelastic nucleon(proton)-nucleus(b ) reaction cross - section and @xmath44 is the inelastic @xmath33 cross - section for the collision of nucleus @xmath40 and nucleus @xmath39 .",
    "the values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 have been worked here out by the following formula @xcite @xmath47 with @xmath48 mb , @xmath49 .    the second term in expression (",
    "8) is a physical factor related with energy degradation of the secondaries due to multiple collision effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 occurring in this term is a measure of the fraction of the nucleons that suffer energy loss .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath50 is unity , while all the nucleons suffer energy loss .",
    "this @xmath50 parameter is usually to be chosen @xcite , depending on the centrality of the collisions and the nature of the secondaries .",
    "this section will be divided in the following sub - sections : ( i ) the @xmath15-spectra of pion , kaon and antiproton in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 = 2.76 tev ; ( ii ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratio behaviour at @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 = 2.76 tev ; ( iii ) rapidity distribution of pion for the most central collisions of @xmath3 in the above - mentioned energy and ( iv ) the nuclear modification factor @xmath51 in the same energy range .",
    "we can write from expression ( 8) , the transformed scm - based transverse - momentum distributions for @xmath52-type reactions in the following generalized notation : @xmath53 where , for example , the parameter @xmath54 can be written in the following form : @xmath55    in a similar way , the values of @xmath56 of the equation ( 10 ) have been calculated with the help of eqn.(1 ) , eqn.(2 ) .",

    "\\(1 ) the invariant yields against transverse momenta ( @xmath15 ) for @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath37 in proton - proton collisions obtained on the basis of the scm are shown in figure 1 . except for very low-@xmath15 region , there is a bit degree of success .",
    "the model disagrees in the low-@xmath15 region .",
    "this is due to the fact that the model has turned essentially into a mixed one with the inclusion of power law due to the inclusion of partonic rearrangement factor .",
    "however , the power - law part of the equation might not be the only factor for this type of discrepancy .",
    "the initial condition and dynamical evolution in heavy - ion collisions are more complicated than we expect .",
    "till now , we do not know the exact nature of reaction mechanism",
    ". one might take into account some other factors like radial flow or thermal equilibrium .",
    "\\(2 ) similarly , in calculating the yields for different transverse momenta and for different centralities for @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath37 in lead - lead collisions , we use eqns .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) alongwith eqns .",
    "( 1)-(7 ) .",
    "the results are given in table 2 and are depicted in figs .",
    "2(a ) , 2(b ) and 2(c ) respectively .",
    "the top - most curves are for central collisions ( 0 - 5@xmath68 ) and the lowest curves are peripheral ones ( 80 - 90@xmath68 ) . in between these two curves , other centralities ( 5 - 10@xmath68 , 10 - 20@xmath68 , 20 - 30@xmath68 , 30 - 40@xmath68 , 40 - 50@xmath68 , 50 - 60@xmath68 , 60 - 70@xmath68 and 70 - 80@xmath68 ) have been plotted . for the production of pions ,",
    "the scm - based results show good fits from central to peripheral collision .",
    "slight disagreements observed at very low-@xmath15 regions for kaons and protons at central collisions .",
    "these are due to the power law part of the model . here",
    ", we see that the constituent rearrangement terms are clearly centrality dependent .",
    "this explanation is also true for low-@xmath15 region data in @xmath2 collision .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratio behaviours for different centralities are calculated in the light if the scm and they are plotted in figs .",

    "\\(4 ) in explaining the rapidity distribution for production of pions ( figure 4 ) , the majority of the produced secondaries , the model works agreeably with data .",
    "the comparison with gaussian fit is satisfactory .",
    "\\(5 ) the nuclear modification factors for pion , kaon and proton for central @xmath3-collisions for different transverse momenta have been calculated and they are plotted in figure 5 . while the theoretical plots are agreeable in low-@xmath15 regions , they disagree in high-@xmath15 .",
    "now , let us sum up our observations in the following points ; ( 1 ) the model under consideration here explains the data modesly well on @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 = 2.76 tev .",
