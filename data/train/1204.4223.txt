    "low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes have become a mainstay of wireless communications .",
    "originally proposed by gallager in 1963 @xcite , ldpc codes lay largely unnoticed ( although see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) until their re - discovery in the mid 90s @xcite , @xcite . since then many hundreds of papers have been published outlining the near optimal performance of ldpc codes over a wide range of noisy wireless communication channels . in almost all of these previous works it was assumed that the characteristics of the noisy wireless channel was known .",
    "however , the reality is that in many cases an exact determination of the wireless channel is unavailable .",
    "indeed , several works have in fact investigated the case where a channel mismatch ( or channel misidentification ) occurs , which in turn impacts on the performance of the ldpc decoder ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "from the perspective of the work reported on here , the most interesting aspect of such channel mismatch studies is the asymmetry in the ldpc code performance as a function the channel crossover probability for the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) .",
    "in fact , the main focus of the work described here is an investigation of whether such asymmetric ldpc code performance carries over from the classical bsc to quantum ldpc codes operating over the quantum depolarizing channel .    since the discovery of css ( calderbank , shor and steane ) codes @xcite @xcite and stabilizer codes @xcite",
    ", it has been known how quantum error - correction codes can be developed in a similar manner to classical codes .",
    "quantum ldpc codes based on finite geometry were first proposed in @xcite , followed by the _ bicycle _ codes proposed in @xcite .",
    "their research explored the conjecture that the best quantum error - correcting codes will be closely related to the best classical codes , and in @xcite poulin _ et al . _ proposed serial turbo codes for quantum error correction .",
    "a more detailed history on the development of qecc can be found elsewhere _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , many works attempting to improve quantum ldpc code performance have been published @xcite @xcite , and @xcite based on quasi - cyclic structure since it reduces the complexity of encoding and decoding .    recently in @xcite the impact of channel mismatch effects on the performance of quantum low - density parity - check codes was highlighted . in investigations of the performance of quantum ldpc codes",
    "it has been assumed that perfect knowledge of the quantum channel exists .",
    "of course in practice this is not the case . in this work",
    "we utilize optimal estimates of the channel derived from quantum fisher information about the channel parameters . even in this optimal situation ,",
    "the use of the unbiased estimator to estimate the level of channel noise produces an approximately order of magnitude degradation to the performance .",
    "we note , however , that the use of quantum entangled states will aid an estimating the noise level of the channel .",
    "however , there is a practical trade - off in hardware complexity between entanglement consumption and code performance .    in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the behavior and the robustness of the sum - product decoding algorithm when simulating over the quantum depolarizing channel .",
    "interestingly , an asymmetry behavior in performance is observed as a function of the estimated channel flip probability , showing that the performance of a quantum ldpc code would experience a reduced degradation when the channel is overestimated instead of underestimated , given the overestimated channel knowledge still within the threshold limit of the code .",
    "based on these observations , a new decoding strategy is proposed that can improve a quantum codes performance by as much as @xmath0 .    in section ii we discuss the behavior of the classical sum - product decoder under channel mismatch conditions . in section",
    "iii we briefly review quantum communications and the _ stabilizer _",
    "formalism for describing qeccs , and discuss their relationship to classical codes . in section",
    "iv we explore the behavior of a quantum decoder when simulating over a quantum depolarizing channel and show how the decoding strategy we outline here leads to a significant improvement in performance relative to decoders that simply utilize the estimated channel parameter .",
    "lastly , in section v we draw some conclusions and discuss future works .",
    "it is well known in classical coding that low - density parity - check codes are good rate achievable codes @xcite @xcite , given an optimal decoder .",
    "the best algorithm known to decode them is the sum - product algorithm , also known as iterative probabilistic decoding or belief propagation ( bp ) .",
    "the performance of sparse - graph codes can be improved if knowledge about the channel is known at the decoder side . however , in practical situations the decoder unlikely to know the channel s characteristics exactly , thus , the robustness of the decoder to channel mismatches is also an important issue when designing practical codes .    in @xcite , mackay _ et.al",
    "_ investigated the sensitivity of gallager s codes @xcite to the assumed noise level ( classical bit - flip probability ) when decoded by belief propagation .",
    "a useful result therein is that the belief propagation decoder for ldpc codes appears to be robust to channel mismatches because the block error probability is not a very sensitive function of the assumed noise level .",
    "in addition , an underestimation of channel characteristics deteriorates the performance more compare to an overestimation of channel characteristics .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : classicalbehavior ] .        our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : classicalbehavior ] are for a rate half code of block length @xmath1 and a binary symmetric channel .",
    "the code is a @xmath2 regular ldpc codes which is constructed with the length of the cycle maximized .    by inspection , the plotted result shows a similar behavior to that found by mackay in @xcite .",
    "the vertical straight line indicates the true value of the noise level , and the minimum point of the plot is approximately at the intersection between two lines .",
    "this infers that an optimal performance of a practical sum - product decoder can be achieved when the input of decoder is the true noise level .",
    "the slope towards the left of the graph is more steeper than the slope towards the right , indicating that underestimation of the noise level degrades the performance more so than overestimation does .",
    "however , when the estimated noise level is far too large , there is a significant increase in the error probability .",
    "such higher bit flip probabilities can be thought of as the classical shannon s limit ( in this case , the shannon s limit for rate @xmath3 code is @xmath4 ) , which theoretically represents the maximum allowable noise level under reliable transmission at a certain rate .",
    "a stabilizer generator @xmath5 that encodes @xmath6 qubits in @xmath7 qubits consists of a set of pauli operators on the @xmath7 qubits closed under multiplication , with the property that any two operators in the set _ commute _ , so that every stabilizer can be measured simultaneously .",
    "an example of a stabilizer generator @xmath5 is shown below for @xmath8 representing a rate @xmath9 quantum stabilizer code , @xmath10    consider now a set of error operators @xmath11 taking a state @xmath12 to the corrupted state @xmath13 . a given error operator either commutes or anti - commutes with each stabilizer @xmath14 ( row of the generator @xmath5 ) where @xmath15 .",
    "if the error operator commutes with @xmath14 then @xmath16 and therefore @xmath13 is a @xmath17 eigenstate of @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , if it anti - commutes with @xmath14 , the eigenstate is @xmath18 the measurement outcome of @xmath13 is known as the _ syndrome_.      to connect quantum stabilizer codes with classical ldpc codes it is useful to describe any given pauli operator on @xmath7 qubits as a product of an @xmath19-containing operator , a @xmath20-containing operator and a phase factor @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the first row of matrix ( [ stabilizer ] ) can be expressed as    @xmath22    thus , we can directly express the @xmath19-containing operator and @xmath20-containing operator as separate binary strings of length @xmath7 . in the @xmath19-containing operator a @xmath23 represents the @xmath19 operator ( likewise for the @xmath20 operator ) , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting binary formalism of the stabilizer is a matrix @xmath26 of @xmath27 columns and @xmath28 rows , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent @xmath19-containing and @xmath20-containing operators , respectively _ example 1 : _ for example , the set of stabilizers in ( [ stabilizer ] ) appears as the binary matrix @xmath31    @xmath32    due to the requirement that stabilizers must commute , a constraint on a general matrix @xmath31 can be written as _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "@xmath33    note that the quantum syndrome can be conceptually considered as an equivalent to the classical syndrome @xmath34 , where @xmath31 is a binary parity - check matrix and @xmath35 is a binary error vector .    to summarize ,",
    "the property of stabilizer codes can be directly inferred from classical codes .",
    "any binary parity - check matrix of size @xmath36 that satisfies the constraint in ( [ binaryconstraint ] ) defines a quantum stabilizer code with rate @xmath37 that encodes @xmath6 qubits into @xmath7 qubits .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "an important class of codes are the _ css codes _",
    "these have the form    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 and @xmath42 matrices , respectively , ( @xmath43 does not necessary equal to @xmath44 ) .",
    "requiring @xmath45 ensures that constraint ( [ binaryconstraint ] ) is satisfied .",
    "if @xmath46 , the resulting css code structure is called a _ dual - containing code_. most classical ( good ) ldpc codes do not satisfy the constraint ( [ binaryconstraint ] ) .",
    "motivated by the decoding asymmetry discussed above for classical ldpc codes , we now wish to explore whether a similar asymmetry in decoding performance is achieved for quantum ldpc codes . as stated above several well known classes of quantum codes , such as quantum stabilizer codes and css codes can be designed from existing classical codes . upon construction of such codes",
    "we will then investigate the decoding performance under asymmetrical estimates of the quantum channel parameters .",
    "the quantum channel we investigate is the widely adopted polarization channel .",
    "the issue of quantum channel identification ( quantum process tomography ) is of fundamental importance for a range of practical quantum information processing problems ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in the context of ldpc quantum error correction codes",
    ", it is normally assumed that the quantum channel is known perfectly in order for the code design to proceed .",
    "in reality of course , perfect knowledge of the quantum channel is not available - only some estimate of the channel is available . to make progress we will assume a depolarization channel with some parameter @xmath47 .",
    "given some initial system state @xmath48 , a decoherence model can be built by studying the time evolution of the system state s interaction with some external environment . in terms of the density operator @xmath49 ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath50 in a channel , which can be written as @xmath51 , is a completely positive , trace preserving , map which provides the required evolution of @xmath50 .",
    "the depolarization parameter , @xmath47 , of a qubit where @xmath52 , is defined such that @xmath53 means complete depolarization and @xmath54 means no depolarization . in terms of the well - known pauli matrices @xmath55 ( here @xmath56 , the depolarization channel for a single qubit can be defined as @xmath57 .",
    "note that it is also possible to parameterize the depolarization channel as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "this latter form is more convenient for decoding purposes , and below we term @xmath60 as the _ true flip probability_.    however , in what follows we will assume the true value of @xmath60 is unknown _ a priori _ , and must first be measured via some channel identification procedure .",
    "this estimate of @xmath60 , which we will refer to as @xmath61 , will be used in a decoder in order to measure its performance relative to a decoder in which the true @xmath60 is utilized .    in general ,",
    "quantum channel identification proceeds by inputting a known quantum state @xmath62 ( the probe ) into a quantum channel @xmath63 that is dependent on some parameter @xmath64 ( in our case @xmath65 ) . by taking some quantum measurements on the output quantum state @xmath66 which leads to some result @xmath67",
    ", we then hope to estimate @xmath64 .",
    "the input quantum state may be unentangled , entangled with an ancilla qubit ( or qudit ) , or entangled with another probe .",
    "multiple probes could be used , or the same probe can be recycled ( _ i.e_. sent through the channel again ) .    as can be imagined many experimental schemes could be developed along these lines , and the performance of each scheme ( _ i.e. _ how well it estimates the true value of the parameter @xmath64 ) could be analyzed . however , in this study we will take a different tact . here",
    "we will simply assume an experimental set - up is realized that obtains the information - theoretical _ optimal _ performance .",
    "optimal channel estimation via the use of the quantum fisher information has been well studied in recent years , particularly in regard to the determination of the parameter @xmath60 of the depolarizing channel ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . defining @xmath68 .",
    "quantum fisher information about @xmath60 can be written as @xmath69l_f^2 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the symmetric logarithmic derivative defined implicitly by @xmath71 and where @xmath72 signifies partial differential w.r.t .",
    "@xmath60 . with the quantum fisher information in hand ,",
    "the quantum cramer - rao bound can then be written as @xmath73 \\ge { \\left ( { n_mj(f ) } \\right)^ { - 1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 $ ] is the mean square error of the unbiased estimator @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the number of independent quantum measurements .",
    "the performance results in @xcite are obtained by randomly estimating a flip probability from a truncated normal distribution at the decoder side , given the mean square error of the unbiased estimation @xmath75 . in return , the performance is degraded approximately an order of magnitude .      the appropriate decoding algorithm to decode quantum ldpc codes is based on the classical sum - product algorithm since the most common quantum channel model , namely _ depolarizing channel _ , is analogous to the classical @xmath77-ary symmetric channel .",
    "the received values at the decoder side can be mapped to measurement outcomes @xmath78 ( syndrome ) of the received qubit sequence , and this syndrome is then used in error estimation and recovery . assuming an initial quantum state representing a codeword , the initial probabilities @xmath79 for the @xmath80 qubit of the state undergoing an @xmath19 , @xmath81 or @xmath20 error are    @xmath82    where @xmath60 is the flip probability known at the decoder .",
    "the standard bp algorithm operates by sending messages along the edges of the tanner graph .",
    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the messages sent from bit node _ i _ to check node _",
    "j _ and messages sent from check node _",
    "j _ to bit node _ i _",
    ". also denote @xmath85 as the number of neighbors of bit node @xmath86 , and define @xmath87 as the number of neighbors of check node @xmath88 .",
    "to initialize our algorithm , each qubit node sends out a message to all its neighbors equal to its initial probability value @xmath64 obtained according to equation ( [ llrbsc ] ) . upon reception of these messages",
    ", each check node sends out a message to its neighboring qubit node given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes all neighbors of check node @xmath88 except qubit node @xmath86 , and the summation is over all possible error sequences @xmath91 .",
    "each bit node then sends out a message to its neighboring checks given by    @xmath92    where @xmath93 denotes all neighbors of qubit node @xmath86 except check node @xmath88 .",
    "equations ( [ checktobit ] ) and ( [ bittocheck ] ) operate iteratively until the message is correctly decoded or the maximum pre - determined iteration number is reached .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the dependence of the performance of a quantum ldpc code on the estimated flip probability @xmath94 of a depolarizing channel using the same quantum ldpc code simulated in @xcite . in each decoding process",
    ", the decoder performed an iterative message passing algorithm ( sum - product decoding algorithm ) until it either found a valid codeword or timed out after a maximum number of @xmath95 iterations .",
    "if the maximum number of iterations was reached then the decoding process was considered a failure .",
    "conversely , whenever a valid codeword was found , it was the correct one regardless whether it was the actual transmitted codeword . thus , the simulation plots herein is the block / qubit error probability ( bler / qber ) as a function of noise level , where the block error probability is defined    @xmath96    the noise vectors were generated to have weight exactly @xmath97 , where @xmath7 was the block length of the code @xmath98 and @xmath60 was the true flip probability for the depolarizing channel .",
    "the decoder assumed an estimated flip probability @xmath94 .",
    "we varied the value of @xmath94 while the the true flip probability @xmath60 is fixed .",
    "the result of our simulation is shown in figure [ fig : fvsfhat ] .",
    "similar to the case of our classical ldpc code discussed earlier we can see from figure [ fig : fvsfhat ] , that optimal performance in the quantum ldpc code can be obtained when the input at the decoder is the true flip probability , _",
    "i.e _ exact channel knowledge .",
    "the trend of the curve in figure [ fig : fvsfhat ] also shows the impact on block error probability caused when overestimation of the flip probability is less than that arising from an overestimation of the channel flip probability .",
    "when the assumed flip probability reaches a limit ( beyond the limit of @xmath99 for a classical rate @xmath100 code ) , there is a catastrophic increase in the error probability .",
    "this result indicates that in the quantum case ( just as found in the classical case ) a limit to the degradation in performance may occur if in any estimate of the channel flip probability , an overestimate of the flip probability is utilized .",
    "we investigate this possibility further in what follows .",
    "consider now the case where a decoder can only attain partial channel information by probing the quantum channel using un - entangled or entangled quantum states ( only one measurement each , _ i.e. _ @xmath101 ) .",
    "given such partial information we will then weight our estimate of the channel parameter ( at the decoder side ) to large values ( rather than smaller values ) of the estimated flip probability .",
    "a schematic of our new decoding strategy is shown in fig .",

    "attempt to mimic the situation where to any estimate of the total flip probability @xmath94 an additional @xmath104 is added at the decoder side ( with an upper limit on the flip probability related to shannon s limit for the classical code rate ) . in the simulations , shown @xmath105",
    "was set at @xmath106 .",
    "it is this new estimate that is referred to as  improved decoder \" in the figures .",
    "the quantum ldpc code used here has block length of @xmath98 qubits with its quantum code rate @xmath107 .",
    "the decoding process terminates if @xmath108 block errors are collected or the maximum iteration number @xmath109 is reached .",
    "we can clearly see that by weighting the estimated channel information @xmath94 higher ( overestimating ) , an approximately @xmath0 improvement in performance for both using entangled quantum states and without entangled states .",
    "various other simulations were run with @xmath105 was set at other ratios .",
    "however , we find that setting @xmath105 w at @xmath106 resulted in close to optimal performance for the specific code studied .",
    "it is straight forward to carry our a numerical fit to the curves shown fig .  4 and fig .  5 ,",
    "producing `` cost '' functions for the codes as a function of @xmath105 . differentiating such curves with respect to @xmath105 will lead to the value @xmath110 .",
    "we conjecture that all quantum codes applied in misidentified depolarizing channels will show similar performance than that showed here .",
    "the specific value of @xmath105 , however , will likely vary from code to code .",
    "such studies form part of our ongoing work in this area .    in practical situations ,",
    "a trade - off between entanglement consumption and quantum ldpc code performance is one of important aspect when partial channel information is available to the decoder . theoretically ,",
    "when the number of entanglement pairs used is very large , the performance should approach the case where perfect channel knowledge is known at the decoder side .",
    "however , a reduction in the number of required entanglement pairs could also yield a near optimal performance if a constant overestimation of channel is utilized when estimating the quantum channel .     for case a. the dash lines plots the bler of the code and the solid line plots the qber of the code.,width=307 ]     for case b. the dash lines plots the bler of the code and the solid line plots the qber of the code.,width=307 ]",
    "in this work we have investigated possible improvements in the decoding strategies of quantum ldpc decoders in the quantum depolarization channel .",
    "the importance of the channel mismatch effect in determining the performance of quantum low - density parity - check codes has very recently been shown to lead to an order of magnitude degradation in the qubit error performance . in this work",
    "we have illustrated how such a performance gap in the qubit error performance can be substantially reduced .",
    "the new strategies for quantum ldpc decoding we provided here are based on previous insights from classical ldpc decoders in mismatched channels , where an asymmetry in performance is known as a function of the estimated bit - flip probability .",
    "we first showed how similar asymmetries carry over to the quantum depolarizing channel .",
    "we then showed show that when a weighted estimate of the depolarization coherence parameter to larger values is assumed , significant performance improvement by as much as @xmath0 was found .",
    "for the specific quantum code studied here we found that given a specific estimate of the channel flip probability , increasing that estimate by half as much again provided the most improved decoding performance .",
    "future work will further investigate asymmetric decoder performance in other quantum channels for which multiple parameters must be estimated in order to define the channel .",
