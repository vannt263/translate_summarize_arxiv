    "in the late eighties , barnes ( 1989 ) , using simulations , realized that a merging of a compact group of galaxies forms an elliptical galaxy over a short fraction of the hubble time and the end product resembles a field elliptical .",
    "later , ponman & betram ( 1993 ) studying hcg 62 has concluded that compact groups result from orbital decay of galaxies into an extended dark matter halo and the final system , a fossil group , would be a massive elliptical immersed in an extended halo of hot gas .",
    "the discovery of such a system by ponman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) rendered trustable the whole picture .",
    "operationally , fgs are systems exhibiting extended x - ray emission with l@xmath1 and the difference in magnitudes between the fossil galaxy and the second brightest in the group , @xmath2 , equals 2.0 , in r - band ( see la barbera et al .",
    "2009 for a discussion on this threshold limit ) .",
    "only galaxies picked within a radius equal to half of the virial radius are considered .",
    "several fg samples have been defined in the redshift range 0@xmath3 z @xmath30.6 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1999 ; romer et al .",
    "2000 ; jones et al . 2003 ; ulmer et al . 2005 : santos et al .",
    "2007 ; la barbera et al . 2009 ; voevodkin et al . 2010 ; aguerri et al . 2011 ; miller et al . 2011 ) .",
    "although the data on these systems is growing fast , their origin is still debatable .",
    "dariush et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used the millennium simulation to show how fgs assembled their dark matter halos .",
    "they find that fgs have already their mass in place by z@xmath41 while their non - fg systems are still accreting mass today .",
    "so , in this case non - fgs form later which is corroborated by the work of donghia et al .",
    "this seems to be a possible alternative to the compact group merging scenario ( barnes 1989 ) .",
    "however , la barbera et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , examining a sample of 25 fgs and a similar control sample of non - fgs at z@xmath30.1 , find no difference between structural and stellar population properties of fgs and non - fgs , suggesting that fgs may just represent a transient phase of mass assembly in the universe .",
    "in fact , as shown by simulations , galaxy groups may undergo through a `` fossil phase '' , a stage characterized by a large magnitude gap , terminated by the infall of fresh galaxies from the surroundings  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we study 6 fg candidates from our previous work ( la barbera et al.2009 ; hereafter ldc09 ) , using dedicated xmm , and archival _ chandra _ x - ray observations .",
    "this allows us to ( i ) assess the success rate of finding true fgs by combining sdss and rass data ( as in ldc09 ) ; and ( ii ) highlight some important pitfalls in the approaches commonly used to search for fgs .",
    "we revisit the issue of the similarity between seed ellipticals of fgs and non - fossil galaxies using all the available data for these systems , namely , the density excess of neighbouring faint galaxies , distance from the red sequence in the color  magnitude diagram , structural parameters such as @xmath5 ( parametrizing the deviation of galaxy isophotes from the elliptical shape , see e.g.  @xcite ) and internal color gradients , ages , metallicities , and @xmath6-enhancement .",
    "all these informations with the x - ray properties , for the first time presented here , form the basic data set used in the analysis .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : section 2 , discusses how the sample of fg candidates was selected ; section 3 presents the new xmm observations , data reduction and how the x - ray analysis was conducted ; in section  4 we discuss the main pitfalls of the optical definition of an fg , while in section  5 we analyze the velocity distribution of group galaxies for the x - ray confirmed fgs ; section  6 deals with the number density of fgs , and the comparison of the properties of fossil and non - fossil galaxies . in section  7",
    "we summarize the main findings of this contribution . throughout the paper , we adopt the cosmology @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the sample of six fg candidates studied here was taken from ldc09 , where we have defined a sample of 29 nearby ( @xmath10 ) fg candidates , by combining sdss and rass data .",
    "the selection of fg candidates was based on the volume - complete catalogue of all galaxies with r - band magnitude @xmath11 and spectroscopic redshift between @xmath12 and @xmath13 from sdss - dr4 .",
    "we defined as fgs those elliptical galaxies with no companion brighter than a given magnitude gap , @xmath14 , within a maximum projected radius , @xmath15 , and within a maximum redshift difference , @xmath16 . as a compromise between the number of selected fg candidates and that of false fg detections , we set @xmath16@xmath17 , @xmath15@xmath18 , and @xmath14@xmath19 .",
    "we notice that these criteria are not the same as those of @xmath15@xmath20 , and @xmath14@xmath21 proposed , on a qualitative basis , by  @xcite ( hereafter j03 ) , and widely adopted in the literature ( but see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we revisit this issue in sec .",
    "[ sec : fossilness ] .",
    "we excluded galaxies with agn signatures in the optical spectra , and those close ( within @xmath22 ) to a rich cluster .",
    "finally , we chose only the 29 systems with significant x - ray emission from the rass , 25 of which being classified as extended relative to the rass psf .",
    "all systems turned out to have x - ray luminosity larger than @xmath23 , i.e. , the j03 threshold to qualify a system as an fg .",
    "we have started a program to observe the 29 fg candidates of ldc09 with xmm , to better characterize their x - ray emission . because of the low s / n and angular resolution of the rass , the x - ray emission of each system requires confirmation through dedicated follow - up observations .",
    "in the present work , we analyze data for six candidates , five of which classified as x - ray extended by ldc09 ( i.e. fg1 , fg3 , fg4 , fg12 , fg14 ) , and the remaining one ( fg27 ) uncertain . throughout the paper , fg",
    "candidates are indicated with the same i d number as in ldc09 ( see their table  2 ) .",
    "we also compare the properties of seed ellipticals in the four ( out of six ) confirmed fgs with those of non - fossil ellipticals . to this effect",
    "we select the 15 `` field '' ellipticals brighter than @xmath24 ( i.e. the faint magnitude limit of seed ellipticals in our sample of confirmed fgs ) , out of the list of 66 `` field '' galaxies with significant x - ray emission presented by ldc09 .",
    "we notice that 7 ( out of 29 ) fg candidates in ldc09 have seed ellipticals brighter than @xmath25 , making the present sample of confirmed fgs representative ( although small ) of the brightest seed population of fgs .",
    "only 2 out of 29 fg candidates from ldc09 had archival , good - resolution ( @xmath26 fwhm psf ) x - ray observations . in cycle 8",
    ", we submitted an xmm proposal to get x - ray data for the remaining fgs .",
    "the proposal was approved with priority @xmath27 , allowing us to gather data for four more candidates . in table",
    "[ xsample ] we present the final list of the available archival and proprietary observations .",
    "the proprietary data were obtained by the epic camera on board of xmm between september and december 2009 ( pi m.paolillo ) . since the observations were scheduled with c priority , the actual observing times exceeded by a factor of @xmath28 the requested one . however ,",
    "several of our observations were affected by strong flares , reducing the actual useful data .",
    "the xmm data ( including archival ones ) were reduced and calibrated with the standard sas software v10.0.0 ; to maximize the s / n of the data we removed periods affected by very strong flares .",
    "sometimes , where flares affected the whole observation , we retained the data sections were flares were less severe ( see table [ xsample ] ) . while in such cases the data quality is far from being optimal , it allowed us to investigate the fg nature of our targets ( see below ) .",
    "for fg4 , the inspection of the standard _",
    "pipeline products clearly showed that the x - ray emission is resulting from a point - like source , and no additional reduction was performed .",

    "contamination mainly comes from optically dull / x - ray bright agns ( expected to be @xmath32 ) , or blending of different x - ray sources around the target elliptical .",
    "we analyze the distribution of galaxies around each confirmed fg , and compare the properties of ( confirmed ) fossil and non - fossil ellipticals selected from our previous work ( ldc09 ) .",
    "the main results are the following :    - : :    for all systems , we find many galaxies with sdss spectroscopic    redshift close to that of the seed elliptical , within a maximum    distance of @xmath33  mpc .",
    "the velocity dispersion of    fgs ranges from @xmath34 to    @xmath35 .",
    "- : :    all fgs exhibit a clear magnitude gap , @xmath36 ,    within a maximum radius , @xmath15 , from the seed galaxy .",
    "however , the values of @xmath36 and    @xmath15 critically depend on how the total flux of the    seed galaxy is estimated .",
    "being bright ellipticals , seed galaxies have    a surface brightness distribution well described by a sersic profile    with high @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , implying that    petro / model magnitudes from sdss tend to underestimate their total    flux ( by @xmath0  mag ) , and hence the magnitude gap .",
    "considering that most works use a sharp value of    @xmath36   ( typically @xmath39  mags ) to search    for fgs , our finding means that current sdss - based samples may    actually miss a significant fraction of fgs .",
    "in particular , using    @xmath36@xmath40 and sdss magnitudes , we    would lack @xmath41@xmath39 systems , i.e.    @xmath42@xmath43 , out of 4 fgs in our sample .",
    "this    effect should be taken into account when comparing fg number densities    to the expectations of cosmological simulations , potentially    unaffected by such bias . -",
    ": :    we restrict the comparison of properties of seed  fg and non - fossil    ellipticals to the sample of x - ray confirmed systems , finding no    significant difference between the two populations , in agreement with    ldc09 .",
    "the only remarkable feature is the larger scatter of non - fossil    ( relative to fossil ) galaxies for some properties ( i.e. internal color    gradients and @xmath5 isophotal shape parameter ) .",
    "we do not    find fg ellipticals to have preferentially disky isophotes , i.e. , they    do not form preferentially through gas - rich mergers , as previously    claimed in the literature .",
    "- : :    considering our success rate to find true fgs , our current number    density estimate for these systems is @xmath44 ( for    @xmath45 ) , fully consistent with what    expected from cosmological simulations  @xcite , but smaller    @xmath46 the independent estimate of  @xcite . -",
    ": :    lastly , we find that galaxies around one of the x - ray confirmed fgs    ( fg12 ) shows a remarkably complex velocity distribution .",
    "most galaxies    have velocities within @xmath47 to the seed elliptical , defining a clearly elongated    spatial distribution , approximately parallel to the x - ray emission .",
    "a    secondary group of galaxies has average velocity offset of about    @xmath48 to the seed .",
    "they are located    more than @xmath41  mpc ( @xmath49 ) far from    the main structure , with a clumpy spatial distribution .",
    "we argue that    fg12 might be the result of the merging of two groups , that triggered    the merging of @xmath50 galaxies , leading to the    formation of the seed elliptical .",
    "this suggests that not all fgs are    truly fossils , as commonly thought .    the present work points to the importance of next generation wide - area x - ray telescopes , such as erosita ( cappelluti et al .",
    "2011 ) and wfxt ( rosati et al.2011 ) , to obtain large samples of fgs , allowing a robust comparison with predictions from cosmological simulations .",
