    "gravitational lenses provide an useful tool for cosmological investigations , i.e. they can be used to address astrophysical problems such as the cosmological model , the structure and evolution of galaxies , and the structure of quasar accretion disks . especially , large separated images of a quasar reveal the dark - matter content of the lensing galaxies ( or galaxy clusters ) .",
    "however , there are also large separated binary quasar systems that can not be interpreted as images of a lensed quasar .",
    "several methods are developed to confirm or rule out the lens hypothesis for an observed system ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) , but , due to similar quasar spectra , it is sometimes a complex task .",
    "one of the lenses with the large separation between the a and b images ( @xmath1 ) is rx j0921 + 4529 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported multiwavelength observation of rx j0921 + 4529 finding that the system contains two images of a quasar at @xmath2 1.66 .",
    "they also observed a spiral galaxy between the quasar images , which is probably a member of an x - ray cluster at @xmath30.32 .",
    "it was interesting that an extended source was detected near the fainter quasar image b ( denoted as b@xmath4 ) , but not in the image a @xcite .",
    "if this extended source around image b corresponds to the quasar host then the system would be a binary quasar rather than a gravitational lens .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that rx j0921 + 4529 is a binary quasar rather than a gravitational lens .",
    "they analyzed the host galaxies of lensed quasars and in rx j0921 + 4528 they did not find any effects of an einstein ring structure to the host galaxies .",
    "also , when they modeled the system as a lens , they found that the host galaxy has a huge inferred mass deficit ( around 7 - 8 times more than expected ) , while when they treated the system as a binary quasar they found a mass deficit that is typical for the other host galaxies at that redshift .    in principle , there may be several reasons for difference between the spectra of the images of a lensed quasar @xcite : ( i ) in the continuum / line it may be caused by the gravitational microlensing ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * etc . ) ; ( ii ) by the intrinsic variations , ( iii ) extinction can cause difference in the line profiles and in the continuum shapes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and finally ( iv ) there is a small probability , but nevertheless it is also possible , that an image ( in this case b ) is projected very close to another object with emission lines , and moreover , @xcite reported about an extensive source around the image b of rx j0921 + 4529 .",
    "the spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can show a very high variability , not only in the continuum but also in line shapes ( as e.g. in the case of ngc 4151 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of intrinsic variability",
    ", one can expect that the spectra from two epochs ( as well as for both images ) are similar ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a lens with a time delay @xmath5100 days ,",
    "as it was estimated for rx j0921 + 4529 by @xcite , the observed velocity difference could be created by quasar variability coupled with a long time delay .",
    "moreover , the extended object near the b quasar may be a faint galaxy rather than the host galaxy of quasar b , therefore the system can be a lens with large separation of images .    in order to clarify the nature of the rx j0921 + 4529 we performed the new spectroscopic observations of this system with the 6-m telescope of sao , using the long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the observed spectra were compared with those published in @xcite . in this letter",
    "we report our observations ( in  2 ) , we discuss obtained results ( in  3 ) and outline our conclusions ( in  4 ) .",
    "long - slit spectral observations were performed on october 29/30 , 2008 ( hereafter spectra from epoch 2 ) with the multi - mode focal reducer scorpio @xcite installed at the prime focus of the bta  6-m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences .",
    "the seeing was @xmath6 .",
    "a @xmath7 wide slit was placed along a and b components of rxj  0921 + 4529 at the position angle @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral range was 36507540  with a spectral resolution 8 - 10  fwhm .",
    "with a ccd eev 42 - 40 @xmath9 pixels detector , the reciprocal dispersion was @xmath10  per pixel .",
    "the total exposure time was 9600s , divided into eight 20-minute exposures .",
    "the target was moved along the slit between exposures to ease background subtraction and ccd fringes removal in the data processing .",
    "the bias subtraction , geometrical corrections , flat fielding , sky subtraction , and calibration to flux units ( @xmath11 ) was performed by means of idl - based software shortly described in @xcite .    to compare the spectra of images between two different epochs we used the already published spectra of a and b obtained with the mmt and blue chanel spectrograph",
    "( hereafter spectra from epoch 1 , for more details see fig .",

    "position of civ@xmath121550 , heii@xmath121640 , oiii@xmath131662 and ciii]@xmath121909 redshifted at 1.66 are denoted with vertical dashed lines . ]      +",
    "first inspection of the rx j0921 + 4529 a and b component spectra show a big difference between the lines as well as the continuum ( see fig . [ f01 ] ) .",
    "the lines of component b are narrower than those of the component a. additionally in the spectrum of the component b there are prominent heii@xmath121640 and oiii@xmath131661,1663 emission lines which are not present ( or they are too weak ) in component a. on the other hand , it seems that si iii]@xmath121892 line in the blue wing of ciii]@xmath121909 is more intensive in the component a than in b of the system .",
    "next , we measured the line parameters of the most intensive c iv line in the spectra of both components , and also , we measured the redshift from the line peak .",
    "we found the redshifts 1.654 for component a and 1.664 for component b. also the line widths of c iv line ( full width at half maximum intensity - fwhm ) are quite different , i.e. fwhm of c iv in component a is 5300 kms@xmath14 , and in component b is 3000 kms@xmath14 .",
    "the lines in component a show a blue asymmetry , while in component b a red one .    additionally , we compared line profiles of c iv lines from component a and b ( see fig .",
    "[ f02 ] top ) and found that line profiles are different between components ; also , the line profiles of c iv and ciii ] are the same in component b ( see fig .",
    "[ f02 ] bottom right ) , while they are quite different in component a ( see fig .",
    "[ f02 ] bottom left ) , the difference in the blue wing of c iv and ciii ] in the component a may be caused by the contribution of the si iii]@xmath121892 line .",
    "+        first we subtracted continuum in spectra of both components in both epochs , then normalized the spectra on the maximum intensity of the c iv line . by comparing the spectra between the same images obtained from two different epochs ( see fig .",
    "[ f03 ] ) we found that the line shapes in component a from the two epochs are similar ( there are differences in intensity that may be caused by variability ) , but in the case of the component b the lines observed in epoch 1 have a stronger red asymmetry ( stronger red wing ) than ones observed in 2008 ( especially in the civ line ) . also , we found different redshifts in components a and b which are 1.653 and 1.661 , respectively .",
    "that is close to measured redshifts of components a and b in epoch 2 . from two epochs we found that the redshifts of the components a and b are significantly different ( averaged 1.6535@xmath00.0005 for component a and 1.6625@xmath00.0015 for component b ) , as well as other parameters in both epochs , implying that source of radiation is not identical .",
    "the difference between components a and b can not be explain by intrinsic variability , and therefore we can conclude that the system is rather binary quasar than gravitational lens .",
    "taking the average redshift of a and b quasars ( @xmath15 ) and assuming flat cosmological model with @xmath16 = 0.27 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , the corresponding angular diameter distance of rx j0921 + 4529 is @xmath19 mpc and the transverse separation ( i.e. projected linear distance ) between a and b components is 59.6 kpc .",
    "note here , that the spectrum of component b may be composed from the light of two sources , since @xcite reported about a extended source near the component b ( denoted as b , see also observations at ) .",
    "then , one hypothesis may be that the spectrum of component b is composed from the light of one component of lensed qso ( the same as component a ) and from the emission of an additional source . to check it",
    ", we tried to fit the spectra of component a into spectra of component b , and we found that a weak spectral component of a may be present in the component b ( see fig .",
    "[ f04 ] ) .",
    "we multiplied the intensity ( normalized to the c iv line maximal intensity ) of component a with 0.25 and found that it fitted well the blue wings of lines observed in the component b. after subtraction of the a spectral component in both epoch ( see fig .",
    "[ f05 ] ) we obtained that the red asymmetry observed in epoch 1 remained .",
    "it means that there is line shape variability present only in the component b. of course , the spectra of quasars are very similar , and this should be taken with caution .",
    "the future observations are needed to distinguish if rxj 0921 + 4529 is an ordinary binary quasar or an unique object .",
    "in this paper we report briefly the spectroscopic observations of the system rxj 0921 + 4529 . from our spectral observations of the system , we can conclude that the spectral properties ( line parameters ) of rxj 0921 + 4529 a and b components are quite different indicating that it is a binary quasar .",
    "the intrinsic variability coupled with a long time delay can not explain such difference in spectra of the components a and b. also , the future precise spectral observations of components b and b would give more information about the structure of the system , that may be more complex than an ordinary binary quasar .",
