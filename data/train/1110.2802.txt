    "our focus here lies on these eccentric binaries , where measurements of apsidal precession could be used to constrain some of the wd properties . for this purpose ,",
    "we use detailed he wd models with masses between 0.1 - 0.3@xmath3 ( @xcite ) to investigate apsidal precession in eccentric binaries . in what follows",
    ", we consider a binary hosting two stars with masses @xmath4 , and radii @xmath5 , uniformly rotating with angular velocities @xmath6 .",
    "we take the axes of rotation to be orthogonal to the orbital plane .",
    "let @xmath7 be the argument of the periastron , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the orbital period and semi - major axis , respectively , and @xmath10 the orbital eccentricity .",
    "we consider orbital and rotational periods long compared to the free harmonic periods of the component stars ( @xcite ) , so that we can neglect resonances between the tidal forcing angular frequencies and the eigenfrequencies of wd free oscillation modes , that is , we work in the static - tide limit .",
    "apsidal precession occurs when the binary s gravitational potential is perturbed from a pure keplerian potential .",
    "this perturbation can be due , for example , to tides , rotation , and gr .",
    "the contribution to the apsidal precession due to the quadrupole tides raised in star @xmath11 by the companion is ( @xcite ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the so - called apsidal precession constant for star @xmath11 , and it measures the star s central concentration .",

    "* valsecchi et al . ( 2011 ) ) for details on how to calculate @xmath13 from detailed wd models .",
    "the apsidal precession due to the rotational distortion of the star caused by centrifugal forces takes the form ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean motion .",
    "finally , the gr contribution to apsidal precession at the leading quadrupole order is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gravitational constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the total apsidal precession rate ( @xmath19 ) is the sum of the three contributions above considering both components .",

    ", gr dominates @xmath19 at small @xmath29 , while tides and rotation become more significant as @xmath29 increases .",
    "the currently observed sample of rotation rates in dwds suggests that apsidal precession is tidally - induced at frequencies where gr is no longer important ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "apsidal precession can be significant for both hot and cool dwds . for cool components at @xmath30mhz , and @xmath31 , apsidal precession",
    "is expected to shift the gw signal by 3@xmath32 - 4@xmath32 over 1@xmath1yr mission , which is detectable in proposed space based interferometers ( see @xcite for a detectability study ) .",
    "the shift increases by more than a factor of 10 for hot wds , and at @xmath33mhz tides dominate .",
    "note that , due to the dependency of @xmath23 on @xmath27 , binaries hosting hot ( and therefore bigger ) wds have @xmath34 systematically higher than cool ( and contracted ) wds by a factor of @xmath35 .    with lower component masses , @xmath36 decreases , while @xmath23 and @xmath22 increase .",
    "the larger radii of the lower mass models act to increase the tidal and rotational contributions relative to gr , therefore making detection even more favorable .",
    "note that theoretical calculations from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* willems et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) predicted orbital eccentricity distributions ( affected by post - formation gw emission ) that typically peak at @xmath370.1 , with a non- negligible fraction of systems having @xmath10 up to @xmath380.7 .",
    "increasing @xmath10 would lead to much higher rates of apsidal precession ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given the dependence of @xmath39 only on @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath20 , if apsidal precession is detected in binaries where gr is the leading mechanism , it can be used to place constraints on the total system mass .",

    "filled squares denote plateau values . the maximum age considered for each model is 10@xmath1gyr.,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]    as figure [ fig : k2r5_age ] shows , during most of the wd s lifetime @xmath40 assumes a plateau value which is unique for each mass .",

    "( [ eq : gammadottid ] ) effectively depends only on @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath20 for much of the wd lifetime .",
    "a fit of the plateau values of @xmath40 as a function of the wd mass yields @xmath41 , where @xmath20 is the mass in solar units , and @xmath42 is in @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , for any dwd for which apsidal precession is detectable , @xmath44 yields constraints on a particular combination of the masses in the system , which we call the `` apsidal mass function '' .",
    "analyzing an apsidal precession detection only accounting for the gr contribution , could potentially lead to a dramatic overestimate of the components masses .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : detectionerror ] , an eccentric dwd could be misclassified as a binary black hole or neutron star if the total apsidal precession is mis - attributed to gr alone .",

    "we use detailed he wd models to investigate apsidal precession due to tides , rotation and gr in eccentric dwds .",
    "we find that apsidal motion can lead to a significant shift in the emitted gw signal , the effect being stronger for binaries with hot wds .",
    "in general , gr dominates the precession at small orbital frequencies @xmath29 , while @xmath19 is driven by tides at larger frequencies , where gr is no longer important .",
    "we investigate the astrophysical information that can be extracted from a measured @xmath19 .",
    "we show that , as the wd ages , @xmath42 reaches a plateau value that depends only on the wd mass .",
    "this behavior allows us to simplify the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammadottid ] ) , and to use @xmath23 to place constraints on the apsidal mass function also for short - period binaries , extending the possibility of mass measurement to the entire lisa frequency domain . we also find that the component masses that would be inferred from the gr contribution alone could be overestimated by orders of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of tides is necessary for the proper analysis of detected apsidal motion rates of dwds in the lisa band ."
