    "bismuth selenide ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) is known to be a good thermoelectric material , however recently it has attracted much more attention and emerged as a new class of material known as topological insulators @xcite .",
    "topological insulators ( ti ) is a novel electronic state of matter with bulk insulating and topologically protected surface states in three dimension ( 3d ) @xcite ; and correspondingly edge state in two dimension @xcite .",
    "the interest in topological insulators is growing rapidly not only due to their exciting fundamental properties @xcite , but also for their future applications in spintronics @xcite and quantum computing @xcite . understanding the behavior of quantum states in @xmath13d topological insulators is significant and one of the major challenges for carrier conduction in bulk .",
    "as phonon interacts strongly with charge carriers at room temperature a good knowledge of the vibrational properties of this material is essential to understand the carrier transport properties @xcite .",
    "raman scattering is the fast and non - destructive technique that has been widely used to study electron - phonon interaction , phonon dynamics both in bulk and nano materials @xcite .",
    "the band structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 surface states is very much similar to that of graphene @xcite and bismuth selenide also has a layered structure ( as that of graphene ) with quintuple layer of atoms stacked along c - axis .",
    "the five individual layer forming the quintuple layer occur as se(1)-bi - se(2)-bi - se(1 ) and these quintuple layer coupled to another layer with weak van der waals forces @xcite .",
    "since the raman peak position is dependent on the number of layers , it can be used to determine the number of layers in tis @xcite .",
    "micro - raman spectroscopy emerged as a valuable tool to study the number of atomic planes in two dimensional layer materials such as graphene @xcite .",
    "also , a systematic temperature dependent raman studies are extremely important to understand the lattice anharmonicity , phase transition and spin - phonon coupling in bulk and nano materials .",
    "the knowledge of temperature coefficients of raman modes in layered material are useful in estimating the thermal conductivity of these materials @xcite .",
    "recently , kim _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have reported the temperature dependence of @xmath3 phonon mode in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystal . however , to the best of our knowledge , the temperature dependence of other phonon modes in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 have not been investigated so far . here , we report a comprehensive temperature dependent raman study of phonon of different symmetries in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystals grown by modified bridgman technique . a detailed analysis of the variation of the peak positions and full width at half maximum with respect to the temperature has also been discussed .",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were grown using modified bridgman technique ; a high purity ingot(i.e .",
    "@xmath14 n purity ) of bismuth and selenium were taken in a stoichiometric ratio in a tapered ampoule and was sealed the tube at a pressure of about @xmath15 torr .",
    "the ampoules were then placed vertically inside a programmable furnace and heated to @xmath16c for @xmath17 hours .",
    "the temperature of the furnace was then gradually decreased over a period of @xmath14 to @xmath18 days to @xmath19c .",
    "finally , the tubes were quenched in liquid nitrogen .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was used to determine the phase(s ) present and the crystal orientation was determined using back scattered laue diffraction .",
    "the samples were also examined using high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem from jeol jem @xmath20fs ) to ascertain the detailed structure of the crystals .",
    "the exfoliated nanoplatelets obtained from bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystals were transferred to conventional copper tem grids for these measurements .",
    "both the room temperature and temperature dependent raman measurements were carried out using a horiba - yobin t@xmath21 micro - raman system and a @xmath22 _ nm _ wavelength radiation from a diode laser as an excitation source .",
    "small pieces of single crystals were crushed in to a fine powder for powder x - ray diffraction measurement . a rietvald analysis were performed and good fit of the experimental data confirms the space group r@xmath23 m as shown in fig .",

    "the atomic arrangement of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is different from the other members of the layered material family such as graphene and h - bn .",
    "each repeating unit in the crystal is quintuple layer of se - bi - se - bi - se which are held together by weak van der waals forces .",
    "the rhombohedral crystal structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 belongs to the @xmath37 ( r@xmath23 m ) space group symmetry and there are five atoms per unit cell .",
    "thus , one can have @xmath38 zone centre phonon branches in the phonon dispersion relation ; three acoustic and @xmath39 optical phonon .",

    "red line is the data and blue is the line generated using the fitted peaks in green.,width=321 ]    it has been reported that the frequency of vibrations of phonon modes depend on the number of layers and this has been routinely used as a method to identify number of layers in layered materials .",
    "it may be noted that the thickness dependent vibrational frequency of @xmath46 mode is mainly due to the weak van der waals inter layer interaction .",
    "this mode completely vanishes for single layer graphene @xcite and mos@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the non - vanishing polarizability tensor @xcite for these raman active modes can be given by ,    @xmath47    from above polarizability tensors ( i.e. eq . (",
    "[ 2 ] ) ) it can be easily noticed that for a back scattering geometry with cross polarization configuration ( x - y ) the @xmath48 has vanishing components in the off - diagonal whereas on the other hand @xmath42 mode has non - vanishing off - diagonal elements .",
    "we carried out the polarized raman scattering on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystals in order to understand the polarization of different phonon .",
    "in unpolarized configuration four distinct raman peaks can be seen at   @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3](b ) ) corresponding to @xmath54 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , which shows the crystal is in @xmath55 phase as predicted by group theory @xcite .",
    "note that the low frequency @xmath54 mode has very low intensity and has not been observed in most of the reports available in literature @xcite possibly due to the high rayleigh background .",
    "if one compares the raman spectra of parallel and cross polarized states it can be found that the intensities of @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes have reduced considerably ( more than @xmath56% ) for the cross - polarized state and in contrast , the intensities of e@xmath57 modes remain unaltered",
    ". these results are consistent with the raman selection rules discussed in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in case of polycrystalline sample",
    "it is not possible to observe the polarization effect of @xmath43 mode which is due to the random orientation of sample with respect to the laser polarization .",
    "the strong polarization effect of @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes in our sample indicates good quality single crystals .",
    "the temperature dependence of the vibrational modes in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is important for understanding the phonon behavior .",
    "apart from recent work by kim _",
    "et al_. @xcite there is not much detail available in literature on temperature dependent raman studies of phonon of different symmetries in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "we carried out a detailed and systematic temperature dependent raman study on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in the temperature range @xmath4 _ k _ @xmath58 _ k_. figure [ fig : figure4](a ) shows the temperature dependent raman spectra of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "as can be seen , the intensities of all raman active modes ( except the @xmath59 ) are high enough to study the temperature effect on both peak position as well as full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) over the entire temperature range . with increase in temperature the peak position of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "modes were observed to follow systematic red - shift .",
    "moreover , the fwhm increases with increase in temperature .",
    "temperature dependent broadening of @xmath2 mode will be discussed later .",
    "the peak positions as well as fwhm of these phonon modes at each temperature were determined by fitting the raman spectra with a theoretically obtained raman line shape ( damped harmonic oscillator model ) which can be written as @xcite @xmath63    where n = exp[@xmath64 - 1 is the phonon occupation number , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the peak position and the line width respectively and @xmath67 is related with peak intensity . the change in peak frequency of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes with increase in the temperature are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure4](b ) , [ fig : figure4](c ) and [ fig : figure4](d ) respectively .",
    "one can see from these plots that the peak frequencies vary monotonically with increase in temperature .",
    "the following linear equation is used to fit the data @xcite @xmath68    where , @xmath65 is the frequency of vibration of @xmath46 or @xmath69 modes at absolute zero temperature , @xmath70 is the first order temperature co - efficient of the @xmath71 or @xmath69 modes .",
    "the values of temperature coefficient for each raman mode are listed in table [ table:1 ] . during these analysis",
    "higher order temperature coefficient are not considered as the temperature range used for our experiments is @xmath72 k.    .comparison of raman peak position , fwhm and temperature co - efficient for different raman modes in single crystal bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .

    "in summary , from the polarized raman scattering measurement it was found that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes show strong polarization effect , indicating the good quality of single crystals of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 grown using the modified bridgeman technique .",
