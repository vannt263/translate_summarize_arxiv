    "homogenization is a tool of mathematical modeling to identify reduced descriptions of the macroscopic response of multiscale models . in the context of the prototypical elliptic model problem @xmath0",
    "microscopic features on some characteristic length scale @xmath1 are encoded in the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 and homogenization studies the limit as @xmath1 tends to zero .",
    "it turns out that suitable limits represented by the so - called effective or homogenized coefficient exist in fairly general settings in the framework of @xmath3- , @xmath4- , or two - scale convergence @xcite .",
    "however , the effective coefficient is rarely given explicitly and even its implicit representation based on cell problems usually requires structural assumptions on the sequence of coefficients @xmath2 such as local periodicity and scale separation @xcite . moreover",
    ", in many interesting applications such as geophysics and material sciences where @xmath2 represents porosity or permeability , complete explicit knowledge of the coefficient is unlikely .",
    "the coefficient is rather the result of measurements that underlie errors or it is the result of singular measurements combined with inverse modeling . in any case , it is very likely that there is uncertainty in the data @xmath2 .",
    "the question is how this uncertainty on the fine scale @xmath1 changes the expected macroscopic response of the process . for works on analytical stochastic homogenization we refer to the classical works @xcite and the recent approaches @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . an overview over computational methods in stochastic homogenization can be found in the review article @xcite .",

    "their supports are determined by oversampling lengths @xmath10 , where @xmath4 denotes the mesh - size of a finite element triangulation @xmath9 on the observation scale .",
    "this choice of oversampling is justified by the exponential decay of the correctors away from their source .",
    "the method leads to quasi - optimal a  priori error estimates and can dispense with any assumptions on scale separation .    the recent work @xcite gives a re - interpretation of the method from @xcite as a quasilocal discrete integral operator for the deterministic case . in a further compression step",
