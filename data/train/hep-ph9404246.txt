    "one of the interesting features of the leptonic sector is the fact that neutrino masses are much smaller than the other fermion masses . to date , no experiment has unequivocally detected nonzero neutrino masses . in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite one",
    "precludes the existence of dirac masses by not having right handed neutrino fields in the theory .",
    "this is a somewhat peculiar feature of the theory , since all other fermions appear as both right handed ( rh ) and left handed ( lh ) fields .",
    "therefore we would like to look for a minimal extension of the sm which does not have this shortcoming .",
    "however , we must then face the problem of justifying the smallness ( or inexistence ) of the neutrino dirac mass terms .",
    "this has been done in several extensions of the sm . in some grand unified theories such as so(10 ) , a majorana lepton number violating mass term for the right handed neutrinos yields neutrinos with small masses through the see - saw mechanism @xcite . in several other models neutrinos are massless and yet lepton flavour is violated . in some of these @xcite @xcite",
    "this is due to the lack of unitarity of the charged current mixing matrix which translates into non - universal couplings for the neutral current interaction . in others @xcite , r - parity violating terms in the superpotential",
    "generate flavour violating neutral current interactions with the electron and the u and d quarks .",
    "most of these models involve rather speculative assumptions about the field content of the theory .",
    "on the other hand , in the sm there is no justification for the presence of only one higgs doublet .",
    "in fact considerable interest has arisen in multi - higgs doublet models , ever since t.  d.  lee showed @xcite that one could have spontaneous cp violation in the two - higgs doublet model . to avoid flavour changing neutral exchanges ,",
    "s.  l.  glashow and s.  weinberg , and independently e.  paschos , proposed the introduction of a discrete symmetry forcing each fermion to couple to only one higgs doublet : this is known as natural flavour conservation @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will use a similar device to show how one can naturally suppress neutrino masses in a two higgs doublet model with three rh neutrino fields .    in section 2 we present our model . in section 3",
    "we study the experimental constraints arising from the processes @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also discuss briefly the decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the last section",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the appendix contains several derivations needed to establish the experimental bounds on the theory .",
    "our model has , in addition to the sm fields , three right handed ( rh ) neutrino fields , @xmath8 , and one extra higgs doublet , @xmath9 .",
    "the higgs potential is chosen so that @xmath9 does not get a vacuum expectation value .",
    "in addition , a discrete symmetry is introduced under which @xmath10 and all other fields remain invariant .",
    "the yukawa and weak lagrangeans are , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the left handed ( lh ) lepton doublet , @xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) is the rh neutrino ( charged lepton ) singlet and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are @xmath16 yukawa coupling matrices . for later use the higgs fields",
    "will be written as @xmath17    we can diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix while keeping the charged current diagonal with transformations , @xmath18 where @xmath19 we can still use the fact that @xmath15 can be diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation , @xmath20 , and the freedom to redefine the rh neutrino fields by , @xmath21 to write , @xmath22 + i i/\\sqrt{2 } [ { \\bar \\nu}_r m \\nu_l - { \\bar \\nu}_l m^\\dagger \\nu_r]\\ , \\\\ { \\cal l}_w & = & \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2 } } { \\bar n}_l \\gamma^\\mu c_l w_\\mu^+ + h.c.\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that all fields in @xmath9 involve the same coupling @xmath23 : the charged scalars link @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; the neutral scalars link @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "a simple example of lepton flavour violations at low energies occurs in the decay of a lh lepton of flavour i into a lh lepton of flavour j and some gauge boson .",
    "this arises through a one loop diagram with intermediate @xmath24 and @xmath9 fields ( cf .",
    ", for example , fig .  1 ) , and will be proportional to , @xmath27 showing a suppression in the limit in which the @xmath28 values are close to each other .    in our model ,",
    "overall lepton number conservation is imposed forbidding majorana mass terms and we shall assume that there is no cp violation in the lepton sector ( that is , the matrix @xmath29 is real and the matrix @xmath30 is orthogonal ; but we will keep our formulas general ) .",
    "moreover , we shall take the new scalar masses to be within an order of magnitude , or so , of the electroweak scale , @xmath31 .",
    "the first important limit on our theory comes from measurement of @xmath32 in the muon decay as compared to that made in the quark sector . for untagged neutrino flavours ,",
    "we have both charged w - exchange and charged h - exchange tree level diagrams . due to their different chiral structures , these",
    "do not interfere and one can easily find , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the charged scalars h.    in our model , the quark mixing matrix is unitary and , therefore , the sum of the magnitudes squared of the elements in its first row must add to one . any deviation will be a measure of how much the expression within parenthesis in eq .",
    "[ eq : gmu ] deviates from one . using the result @xcite ,",
    "@xmath35 we find ; almost an order of magnitude bellow our bound on new physics .",
    "however , to improve these constraints , such as by measuring the neutrino spectra in muon decay , these qed radiative corrections must be taken into account .",
    "an excellent discussion of this can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath36 noting from eq .",
    "[ eq : master ] that @xmath37 , we find that , at tree level , the present sign of the deviation from the mean is consistent with this model .",
    "the effect of the one loop amplitudes will be briefly discussed at the end of this section . in any event , it is a good approximation to take the value of @xmath38 as measured from muon decay , in the following analysis .",
    "the situation concerning the tau branching ratios , is still unclear @xcite .",
    "this is particularly so for the decay into electron and two neutrinos where the relation @xmath39 has only recently become consistent with the standard model ( @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that this problem will continue to disappear with further experiments .",
    "therefore , we shall not derive any constraints from this decay .    as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : master ] , we will have lepton flavour violation in processes such as @xmath4 or @xmath41 .",
    "the first of these processes has one - loop contributions from the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 , involving an intermediate charged scalar and rh neutrinos .",
    "clearly no such diagram exists with an intermediate gauge boson .",
    "the most general form of the invariant amplitude for the process in fig.1 is , @xmath42 u_2(p)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , gauge invariance guarantees that , @xmath44 and the factor of @xmath45 in the @xmath46 terms reflects the fact that this contribution vanishes in the @xmath47 limit .    the diagrams in figs .",
    "1b and 1c only contribute to the @xmath46 terms .",
    "so , it is easier to use the diagram in fig .",
    "1a to find @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and then use eq .",
    "[ eq : help ] to get @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we relegate the full expressions to the appendix .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath45 , and using @xmath54 , we find @xmath55 for the physical process @xmath4 , the photon is on mass shell and only the @xmath56 terms contribute , @xmath57 in particular , for the muon decay we can use , @xmath58 as pointed out above , the first sign is not a strict equality since , in this model , there is also an intermediate charged scalar diagram .",
    "thus , @xmath59 were added to the sm . in that case , to lowest order in an expansion in powers of @xmath60 one obtains @xcite , @xmath61 ! furthermore , even if one includes both dirac and majorana masses , only considerable fine tuning would lead to experimentally relevant values for this branching ratio @xcite .",
    "by contrast , our model is already constrained by experiment .    from the experimental result @xcite of @xmath62",
    "we find , @xmath63 it seems natural to suspect that the @xmath64 are nt much smaller than one , @xmath34 is within an order of magnitude of @xmath65 and that the @xmath30 matrix might have some off - diagonal elements of order @xmath66 , say .",
    "this would raise the exciting prospect of a positive result with further experiments .",
    "for the tau decays , @xmath67 and @xmath68 lead to the considerably weaker bounds , @xmath69 similarly , we will have flavour violation in processes such as @xmath70 due to the diagrams in fig .  2 .",
    "clearly , the z diagram is very suppressed due to the @xmath1 propagator and we can ignore it .",
    "the general expressions have been derived in the appendix . for our model , @xmath71\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , using the experimental constraints we find , @xmath72 these are limits on different quantities than the ones showing up above , but point to roughly the same order of magnitude .    in this model ,",
    "one also has lepton flavour violating @xmath1 decays but these have far worse experimental constraints than the flavour violating lepton decays .",
    "in addition , the theory already predicts that , for example , @xmath73 should be much smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "this arises from the fact that the dominating @xmath2 exchange decay mode of the muon has a three body final state phase space suppression , together with the fact that the @xmath1 has many decay modes .    using the results derived in the appendix",
    "we find that since @xmath75 , the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath46 terms yielding , @xmath76\\ , \\ ] ] where , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 from this one can easily derive a relation between the two branching ratios , namely , @xmath79 showing that even for the tau ( for which the coefficient is around @xmath80 times larger ) this rate is unmeasurably small .",
    "a similar analysis may be performed for the charged gauge interactions .",
    "the results can again be found in the appendix .",
    "the most important feature is the appearance at one loop level of off - diagonal vertices with @xmath2 , leptons and neutrinos . in particular",
    ", the left - handed vector interaction acquires a non - diagonal leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath81\\ , \\ ] ] where the function @xmath82 = [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{m_h^2+m_r^2}{m_h^2-m_r^2",
    "} \\ln{(m_r / m_h)}]+ [ r \\rightarrow i ] + 1\\ ] ] vanishes for @xmath83 , is negative elsewhere and remains of order @xmath84 for any reasonable ratios of scalar masses .",
    "note that this mixing matrix is not unitary and therefore can not be absorbed by a redefinition of the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "thus we find the interesting feature of a non trivial leptonic mixing matrix even with massless neutrinos @xcite with its possible implications for neutrino propagation in matter @xcite .",
    "to be exhaustive we should now go back and reassess our calculation for the muon decay .",
    "indeed , the one loop corrections to the w - exchange amplitude might be comparable to the h - exchange amplitude if @xmath85 \\approx \\frac{v^2}{4 m_h^2 } \\sqrt{\\omega_{\\mu \\mu } \\omega{e e}}\\ ] ] this will depend on the masses of the new scalars and on the @xmath86 .",
    "it is also clear that , for example , the analysis of beta decay must take this into account modifying the extraction of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "we have developed a model with massless neutrinos inspired by a minimal ` democracy ' assumption : there should exist a right - handed singlet partner for every left - handed particle ; the fundamental scalars might also exist in several families .",
    "this was achieved at the expense of a ` discriminatory ' discrete symmetry .",
    "this model has several interesting characteristics .",
    "contrary to what happens if one adds massive dirac neutrinos to the sm , in which case the cosmological limit imposes minute lepton flavour violations , in this model , such lepton flavour violating processes might be within experimental reach , especially @xmath0 .",
    "although one also gets non - diagonal @xmath1 decays we found that these have levels beyond experimental verification .",
    "finally , one also finds non - diagonal @xmath2 interactions , and this despite the fact that the neutrinos are massless .",
    "a novel feature is that this comes about as the result of a clash between the @xmath2 and the @xmath87 interactions with leptons .",
    "this new sector of the theory will also have implications for cosmology .",
    "in particular , the new interactions must be weak enough to decouple the new particles early enough not to affect significantly primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "this work is currently under way .",
    "in this appendix we derive the expressions for the @xmath4 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 decays , in our model . the invariant amplitude for @xmath4 , @xmath90 with @xmath91 u_2(p)\\ , \\ ] ]",
    "may be found by computing solely the feynman diagram of fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that figs .",
    "1b and 1c only contribute to the vector and axial vector parameters which are easier to find with the help of the ward identity .",
    "we find @xmath92 where , @xmath93 the parameter @xmath49 ( @xmath51 ) has the same expression as @xmath48 ( @xmath50 ) , except for a minus sign for the @xmath94 term in eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] ( eq .",
    "[ eq : e ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath95 , we find the result in eq .",
    "[ eq : al ] , to lowest order in @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not enter in either process but , as mentioned above , we can use them to find @xmath52 and @xmath53 through eq .",
    "[ eq : help ] .",

    "the calculation is just a repetition of that for the photon .",
    "the difference in the diagram of fig .",
    "1a ( and therefore in the @xmath56 and @xmath98 terms ) is just due to the @xmath99 ratio between the @xmath100 and @xmath101 vertices .",
