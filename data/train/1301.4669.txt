    "grigorchuk  @xcite was the first to study this topology systematically ; in particular , he used it to construct groups of wildly - oscillating intermediate growth , by approximating them in @xmath17 by solvable groups . for generalities on the the space of marked groups ,",

    "it is also not difficult to see that the restriction of this relation to some classes of groups is an order ; this happens , for example , for residually finite finitely presented groups , such as polycyclic groups ( see corollary  [ cor : polyorder ] ) .",
