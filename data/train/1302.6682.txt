    "a detailed picture of multiplicity is an essential element to understanding low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "binary systems present an opportunity to determine model - independent dynamical masses when both astrometry and radial velocity data are available .",
    "systems so characterized may then become part of the foundations for the construction of an observationally constrained mass - luminosity - age sequence applicable across the entire class .",
    "furthermore , the statistical properties of populations of low mass binaries have profound implications on the basic physics of star formation and solar system assembly .",
    "multiplicity rates are a key discriminant between hypotheses about the formation and evolution of low mass systems , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "two main mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of brown dwarfs in the field : embryo ejection , and gravoturbulent collapse @xcite .",
    "specifically , the embryo ejection hypothesis predicts a low binarity incidence ( @xmath2 ) @xcite , which conflicts with the observed binarity rate ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . mapping the incidence of binarity , and in particular extending completeness to smaller orbital separation is therefore of interest in establishing the primary formation mechanism of field brown dwarfs .",
    "snapshot imaging is a straightforward way to discover new multiple systems .",
    "intrinsically faint and red , l - dwarfs present challenging targets for ground based observations , typically requiring laser guide star ( lgs ) adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "space telescopes naturally offer high strehl ratio imaging at diffraction - limited resolution , with the major departures from ideal performance arising from field - dependent psf changes , spacecraft jitter , and slow optical drift from thermally induced breathing modes of the mechanical structures .    imaging campaigns with the hst have demonstrated notable success in prospecting for companions to cool objects , providing high quality diffraction - limited images of a large number of targets @xcite .",
    "these campaigns have shed light on the population of cool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the simplest and most widely used method for detection of companions in snapshot imaging essentially relies on direct visual examination of images .",
    "obvious companions are quickly identified , and traditional astronomical image analysis tools , namely aperture photometry and centroiding , provide the important astrometric and photometric characteristics of the target . faint or close - in companions are , however , easily missed in a visual search and identifying such objects requires more sophisticated computational techniques .",
    "for example , some stellar images exhibit an elongation along one axis as noted by @xcite which may be suggestive of the presence of a barely - resolved companion .",
    "subtraction of a model psf has been exploited to infer the presence of a companion @xcite , although the performance of this approach is arguably poor , and furthermore it weakly constrains the relative photometry and astrometry .",
    "we propose to look at the same images from an interferometric standpoint , leveraging the exquisite level of calibration this technique offers .    for the detection and characterization of companions at small angular separations ,",
    "non - redundant masking ( nrm ) interferometry used in conjunction with ao has demonstrated outstanding performance , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the key underpinning such successes has been the robust , self - calibrating nature of the observables recovered from nrm interferometry , and in particular the _ closure phase _ ,",
    "first suggested for the radio @xcite and later exploited in the optical @xcite .",
    "imaging systems where the phase on any given baseline in the pupil is disturbed by random phase errors from atmospheric or instrumental aberrations suffer from degraded performance .",
    "however by summing phases around closed loops of non - redundant baselines , these random phasors cancel out and the resulting closure phases are extremely robust to wavefront aberrations .",
    "nrm interferometry from the ground @xcite relies heavily on closure phase for high - contrast detection , and there are plans to extend the technique to space platforms @xcite .",
    "recent observations achieved with this technique reported by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that the level of calibration achieved with interferometric measurements permits the detection of companions at scales at or even somewhat beyond the diffraction limit of the imaging system . recently , nrm interferometry succeeded in providing evidence for a low - luminosity companion in the transitional disk host systems t  cha and lkca  15 @xcite .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated that if a conventional ( full - aperture ) psf is of sufficient quality ( wavefront residual errors typically @xmath4 ) , an analogous set of high - quality interferometric observables can be extracted from the images @xcite .",
    "these new quantities are the _ kernel phases _ , and represent a generalization of the idea of closure phase to a redundant pupil configuration . the major advance offered by kernel",
    "phase interferometry is that it is not restricted to non - redundant pupils . in brief , for small wavefront errors ( i.e. high strehl ratio ) , the phase errors in the pupil plane can be related to those in the fourier plane by a linear operator .",
    "the kernel or null - space of this operator therefore singles out a subspace of baseline phases which are not affected by this error , which can then play the same role as closure phases in providing a robust set of observables to constrain image structure .",
    "kernel phases were first successfully extracted from hst / nicmos data on a single target by @xcite , demonstrating significant improvement over more traditional data analysis @xcite .",
    "the technique has now also been successfully applied to ground based ao observations @xcite .",
    "this paper revisits a sample of nearby ultracool dwarfs observed by the hubble space telescope nicmos nic1 camera and first presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our analysis allows dramatic extensions to the discovery space for putative companions , and in particular explores separation ranges down to 1 au on targets located within 20parsec .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] provides an overview of the dataset and introduces the methods used for our new analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] discusses the results of the kernel phase analysis for the entire sample and implications for the astrophysical interpretation of brown dwarf formation .",
    "this study focuses on two samples of ultracool dwarfs , observed with the hst / nicmos nic1 camera , and whose properties were reported by @xcite and @xcite . each target",
    "was observed in two filters : f110w and f170 m , which correspond loosely to the astronomical @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "these differ in that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands sample atmospheric transmission windows , which do not constrain space - based observations .",
    "we will use @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shorthands for f110w and f170 m respectively , but the difference should be noted . table  [ tbl : sample ] summarizes the observational properties of the combined sample as stated in table 1 of @xcite and table 1 of @xcite .",
    "in addition to detecting several binaries by traditional data analysis methods , these authors also provide a list of 43 and 26 apparently unresolved objects in the 2006 and 2008 samples respectively , which we revisit in this paper .",
    "all ten of the previously resolved binaries were independently recovered with kernel phases , and for all we report significantly improved astrometric precision .",
    "in addition to confirming the technique and software on an unambiguous sample , the dramatic improvements to the binary parameters offer the chance to determine orbital elements and therefore dynamical masses .",
    "both the detections and the remaining unresolved binaries are used in quantitative exploration of the performance limitations of kernel phase analysis in the recovery of high contrast systems .",
    "kernel phase analysis follows the principles introduced in @xcite .",
    "the first step is to generate a model of the pupil of the imaging system as seen from the detector .",
    "this task is straightforward based on information contained in the tinytim v.  7.2 psf simulation package for nic1 @xcite , available at ` tinytim.stsci.edu ` . for kernel phase analysis ,",
    "the model pupil is discretized into a square grid array of 72 sub - apertures with a unit spacing @xmath7th that of the pupil diameter ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "regions of the primary blocked by spiders or the secondary mirror are not sampled , and one can also observe that the unit baseline imposed by this sampling of the pupil imposes an outer working angle of 6@xmath8 .",
    "this geometry fills the @xmath9-plane with a regular grid of 176 distinct sample points at a cadence of 12 points across the diameter .",
    "the transfer matrix that relates instrumental phase errors to spurious @xmath9-phase information is therefore a @xmath10 rectangular matrix , whose svd reveals 36 non - zero singular values ( that is exactly one half of the entire number of sample points in the pupil ) , leaving @xmath11 independent kernel phase relations .",
    "kernel phase analysis can therefore recover @xmath12 of the available phase information present in the quantized grid .",
    "the specific discretization chosen was found to have relatively little impact on the performance of the algorithm .",
    "if instead we adopt a finer - sampled pupil model with 20 points across the diameter , we get 1516 kernel phases out of 1632 distinct baselines , leading to a @xmath13 phase recovery .",
    "we analyzed a portion of our dataset with this finer 20 point sampling and found little improvement in the quality of fit or precision in parameter estimation , though we note somewhat better agreement between @xmath6 and @xmath5 bands with the finer pupil model using levenberg - marquardt model fitting .",
    "because the finer grid analysis was computationally expensive but yielded only a small change in fitted binary parameters , it was judged that application over a large grid to fit the available data was unwarranted .",
    "we have therefore chosen the coarser model for our fitting routines , but note that more computer time may produce some improvements with a finer pupil model .",
    "for application to wider separation binaries , however , the finer model would be strictly required : if we have @xmath14 points across the pupil , nyquist s sampling theorem imposes an outer working angle @xmath15 .",
    "if this condition is not met , the fourier plane fringes will not be well - sampled and parameter estimates will be subject to aliasing or may not be recovered at all .    a shorter wavelength of observation delivers an increase of angular resolution , but with the same level of optical aberration , this also precipitates a greater degree of image degradation ( lower strehl ratio ) . when considering residual phase noise , we therefore expect that the kernel phase signal - to - noise will be accordingly higher for images taken at longer wavelengths .",
    "we are furthermore limited by the fact that we only have single snapshots of each target : without multiple frames it is difficult to calibrate systematic errors and explore statistical uncertainties on the kernel phase observables .",
    "we therefore selected a sample of stars for which we could see no psf abnormality or obvious fourier phase structure , and repeatedly applied a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm to the raw kernel phase data to attempt to find binary companions .",
    "those targets for which no companion model was significantly preferred over a single source were deemed to be `` unresolved '' .",
    "we then used this unresolved population to establish uncertainties as ensemble standard deviations for each kernel phase , which in turn enables quantification of significance in subsequent explorations entailing @xmath16 fitting .",
    "the results presented here could be considerably improved with the design of an observational campaign at the outset which delivers better diversity , by exploiting multiple exposures and dedicated point source calibrators .",
    "a more comprehensive understanding of systematic errors and noise estimates for individual targets would yield more sensitive limits on detection and better errors on fitted parameters .",
    "a binary system at any one epoch can be characterized by its angular separation @xmath17 , position angle @xmath18 and contrast ratio @xmath19 .",
    "the likelihood of a binary model with these parameters given the set of kernel phases @xmath20 is related to the @xmath16 statistic by    @xmath21    when normalized , this likelihood is the joint density probability function for all three parameters .",
    "when calculating @xmath16 , we found it necessary to add an additional systematic error term in quadrature to bring the minimum reduced @xmath16 down to 1 .",
    "confidence intervals for any individual parameter can be calculated by integrating over the two other parameters .",
    "after this _ marginalization _ , we estimate the parameter and its uncertainty from the mean and the standard deviation of the 1-d marginal distribution respectively .",
    "the approach closely follows established practice with closure - phase in nrm - interferometry for the characterization of binaries @xcite .",
    "when applied to our sample hst imaging data set , the final results from our algorithm were : ( 1 ) , confirmation of binaries already identified with other methods ; ( 2 ) , the determination of statistically sound constraints on the binary parameters ; and ( 3 ) , a robust statistical estimate for the probability that signals extracted from any given system betray the presence of a companion or can be attributed to noise .    the sampling and integration of the likelihood function given in equation  [ eq : likely ] is in general difficult , and is typically performed by a computationally - expensive grid integration or a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) random sampling method . in this paper",
    "we apply a recently developed alternative , namely nested sampling .",
    "this method , proposed by @xcite , uses an unusual change of variables to calculate the model evidence .",
    "it has recently seen a surge of interest ; e.g. for cosmological model fitting @xcite , and the analysis of simulated gravitational wave data @xcite .",
    "the key idea of nested sampling is to populate the allowed prior space with a large number ( @xmath22 ) of ` active points ' which are initially chosen at random and subsequently evolved towards ensemble states of successively higher likelihood using mcmc methods .",
    "our implementation was based on @xcite and ultimately yielded a statistical representation of the likelihood space which could be used for binary hypothesis testing and estimation of model parameter values and their uncertainties .",
    "although a number of alternate gradient - descent and mcmc methods were benchmarked , nested sampling was found to be computationally the most efficient . a global binarity analysis of the entire sample in both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands",
    "could be accomplished quickly , however for objects which are in the barely resolved limit , there are well known strong parameter degeneracies  particularly between separation and brightness of a companion .",
    "this ambiguity conflates bright close companion models with somewhat more distant fainter companion models , considerably diminishing the astrophysical utility of the findings .",
    "in addition to separately fitting image data in @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , nested sampling was fast enough to enable joint four - parameter fitting of both images simultaneously @xmath23 .",
    "the ambiguity in separation / contrast from separate fitting was found to be greatly ameliorated by the covariance of separation with contrast .",
    "joint fitting enforces identical separation between bands , greatly restricting the size of the @xmath16 valley of degeneracy with contrast ratio .",
    "these findings are promising for the coming generation of integral field unit cameras working with extreme ao systems which naturally deliver spatio - spectral data cube observations .",
    "for the joint fitting , an additional error term was added in quadrature to represent unknown noise sources .",
    "this was found iteratively such that each band separately had a minimum reduced @xmath16 of 1 at the best joint fit parameters . in cases where the existing error estimates resulted in a minimum reduced @xmath24 ,",
    "no adjustment was made .",
    "for this study , we searched a delimited parameter space for companions .",
    "we initially searched up to a contrast ratio of 200 , somewhat beyond the limits established in section [ deteclimits ] .",
    "candidate binaries were then compared to plots  [ cojointsig ] and [ cojointsignear ] to establish significance .",
    "the range of separation explored ran from 30 to 200mas and all position angles were considered .",

    "all data were processed using our kernel phase techniques , and in the discussion which follows , we divide our results into three subsections : [ known ] , binaries already reported ; [ discovery ] , new binaries uncovered by kernel phase ; [ highcon ] marginal detections meriting further study ; and [ deteclimits ] , sample detection thresholds and the incidence of unresolved sources .      in all cases where",

    "these span the contrast range from 1 to 100 , and therefore cover both the brown dwarf and planetary - mass companion regimes .",
    "this was then scaled down to the expected counts in a 200 mas circle around the target .    in summary ,",
    "no field in either band shows significantly more than 2@xmath47 probability of finding a background star within 200 mas , and in the overwhelming majority of cases , including almost all new binary candidates and marginal detections , this figure was an order of magnitude lower .",
    "it is therefore exceedingly likely that background stars do not contribute in any way to the population of companion candidates in this survey .",
    "from our retrieval of existing and new binaries , we have demonstrated that kernel phase interferometry performs well in medium and wide band filters . for shorter wavelengths the psf quality degrades increasing the errors ,",
    "however in all cases space telescope data are firmly in the regime where wavefront quality is excellent and easily sufficient for the purposes of the algorithm .",
    "this method has demonstrated the delivery of very precise astrometry for medium - separation systems .",
    "if employed over multiple epochs , this will permit correspondingly accurate dynamical mass measurements for most detected binaries .",
    "for the very closest companions , we note that the signal - to - noise ratio is lower and accordingly kernel phase yields weaker constraints on the binary parameters , which nevertheless should still permit the determination of dynamical masses . for systems",

    "adopting distance and mass estimates from @xcite and @xcite , and our own parameter estimates , typical binary objects reported here such as 2 m  2351 - 2537 and 2 m  2028 + 0052 would have a binary separation of @xmath0 1 au and therefore orbital periods of 3 to 4 years . a follow - up campaign with lgs ao",

    "two more epochs should be sufficient to permit a first fit to the binary parameters of each system .",
    "targets observed in 2006 or 2008 will have completed a substantial fraction of their orbit since they were first observed ; on the other hand , over a two month period they will have rotated by 6 degrees in mean anomaly , which is substantially greater than the @xmath0 degree uncertainties in position angle obtained with kernel phase or aperture masking .",
    "these are pessimistic figures , in that the systems are early l dwarfs and include several systems substantially closer than 2 au , which leads to correspondingly shorter orbital periods for targets of interest .    in table",

    "these were calculated by taking the absolute @xmath5 magnitude of the new spectral class as listed in @xcite , applying @xmath5 magnitude bolometric corrections from @xcite and comparing bolometric magnitudes with the 0.5 , 1 and 5 gyr isochrones from @xcite .",
    "the calculated values are subject to direct uncertainties of order @xmath48 : despite the significant uncertainty in photometry , bolometric magnitude is a very strong function of mass and age and purely photometric uncertainties are small . on the other hand , the models used come with significant caveats , especially because brown dwarfs cool as they age : the mass estimates , given photometry , therefore depend on the assumed age of the system . obtaining dynamical masses is key to calibrating these models brown dwarfs in general , as discussed in section  [ intro ] .",
    "these close new binaries therefore present a significant addition to the population of targets which can be followed up on short time scales .",
    "in addition to this , many brown dwarfs are known to exhibit periodic radio or @xmath49 emission , modulated by the body s rotation period , catalogued in detail in .",
    "the radio emission is believed to be from electron cyclotron maser instability in the brown dwarf magnetosphere @xcite . knowing this rotation period and the projected rotational velocity @xmath50 from spectroscopic observations , it is possible then to determine the radius of the object if its spin is assumed to be perpendicular to the orbital plane of the system .",

    "ordinarily poisson statistics would be used ; in this case , however , the sample is too small ( @xmath52 ) , and so binomial statistics are required @xcite .    where @xcite had 8 binaries out of 64 systems observed in the nearest 20 parsecs , giving @xmath53 , five of the previously unresolved systems in the sample now support binary detections . of these ,",
    "the spectral class of 2 m  2351 - 2537 is reclassified to l0/l1 , while the increased spectroscopic distance to 2 m  0045 + 1634 leaves it outside of 20 parsecs .",
    "given that 2 m  2028 + 0052 was already known to lie beyond 20 pc , 3 of these are admissible in the 20-parsec sample .",
    "furthermore , 2 m  1936 - 5502 supports a high - contrast fit , indicating a potential sub - l - dwarf classification , so among the new discoveries , there are 2 firm detections : 2 m  0036 + 1821 and 2 m  2351 - 2537 .",

    "this yields a new binary fraction of @xmath1 . if 2 m  1936 - 5502 is included , the binary fraction is then @xmath54 .",
    "a typical brown dwarf has a mass significantly below the jeans mass of a collapsing protostellar gas cloud @xcite , and it is therefore difficult to explain the observed abundance of field brown dwarfs based on the standard jeans collapse theory of star formation .",
    "this leads to two widely - discussed hypotheses @xcite .",
    "the first , namely gravoturbulent collapse , posits that turbulent gas dynamics allows for the collapse of smaller clouds than naive analysis suggests , and therefore brown dwarfs may form in essentially the same manner as other stars .",
    "the alternative is embryo ejection , whereby gravitational interactions in a protostellar system may eject low - mass companion embryos before they accrete enough gas to achieve fusion in their cores @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose that protostellar cores start out at the opacity limit for turbulent fragmentation ( of order a few @xmath55 ) and proceed to accrete gas until they are ejected dynamically from the cloud .",
    "this behavior differs particularly strongly from direct turbulent collapse in the substellar regime , so that brown dwarfs are thrown out very early in the accretion process .",
    "therefore by testing model predictions for these ultracool stars we provide one of the most stringent tests of the general validity of the @xcite and @xcite models of star formation for all stellar types .    the chief objection to direct gravitational collapse models",
    "had previously been that the collapse of such a low - mass cloud would require it to start out very dense and very cold compared to well - studied star forming regions @xcite .",
    "recent millimeter interferometry by @xcite has caught just such a gravoturbulent collapse in the act , observing a gravitationally bound cloud of mass @xmath56 .",
    "in addition this , @xcite report the detection of a molecular outflow from the brown dwarf binary fu tau , which is the third young brown dwarf system found undergoing a formation process analogous to low - mass stars . with at least one example of a brown dwarf forming directly , models that do not account for this behavior",
    "must therefore be refined .",
    "indeed , simulations by @xcite reproduce the distribution of wide brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars as well as the population of close binaries .    on the other hand , while embryo ejection can easily account for the formation of isolated field brown dwarfs , binaries are problematic .",
    "the binarity fraction of very low mass stars can discriminate between these two models @xcite .",
    "embryo ejection predicts a low binarity fraction in field brown dwarfs , as the gravitational interaction required would disrupt all but the most tightly bound binaries .",
    "the predicted binarity fraction is thus @xmath57 in the oldest models for embryo ejection @xcite , rising only to @xmath58 for systems with a primary mass in the range of 0.08 to 0.1 @xmath59 in the most recent models incorporating radiative feedback @xcite .",
    "the observed binarity fraction of ultracool stars seems closer to @xmath40 @xcite which puts it into conflict with the models of @xcite , although the authors noted that this prediction is subject to significant uncertainty .",
    "the high binarity fraction reported in this paper is still further evidence in favour of a higher binarity rate than predicted by embryo ejection . moreover , with the additional detections this prediction now lies several @xmath60 away from the observed value .",
    "the hybrid ejection model of @xcite , by which still - collapsing clouds can be ejected from a protostellar disk , makes few clear predictions regarding binarity , other than that there should be few large - separation binaries .",
    "given the results of @xcite in observing a gravitationally - collapsing brown dwarf mass object , it is not implausible to suggest that direct gravitational collapse may account for most or all field brown dwarfs .    the effect of radiative feedback in ameliorating the difficulties of modelling brown dwarf formation in @xcite has been suggested by @xcite as an explanation for why the initial mass function and companion mass function changes at the hydrogen burning limit ; while this idea is highly speculative , it seems likely that the identification of systems with a late main sequence primary and a brown dwarf secondary as reported in section  [ highcon ] will be of interest in testing this hypothesis .",
    "we have shown that extraction and fitting to the self - calibrating kernel phase interferometric observables allows for a significant increase in the robust detection of companions and in the accuracy of best - fit parameters recovered when compared to simple inspection of images .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ , or any instrument delivering good wavefront quality may benefit dramatically from such an approach .    using the kernel phase technique on all 79 ultracool dwarfs in the combined hst samples of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we independently recover all 10 prior detections and improve on the precision of fitted parameters such as position angle and separation by a factor of @xmath010 .",
    "furthermore , we report 5 new binary detections missed by the original authors , 4 of which are presented here for the first time , and additionally four marginal detections of close or high contrast companions .",
    "this population forms an excellent base for dynamical studies to establish masses ; a prospect particularly favored by the improved precision in parameter estimation . as well as these confident new detections",
    ", kernel phase identifies up to four more marginally - resolved close or faint companions , which may be of planetary mass .",
    "the finding of a larger binary fraction for this sample helps shed light on the formation mechanisms of very low mass objects .",
    "the five additional ultracool binaries , if confirmed , lend further support to gravoturbulent collapse models for the formation of low - mass stars in the field .",
    "we would like to thank i. neill reid , olivier guyon , paul stewart , barnaby norris , anthony cheetham , and james allison for their interest , helpful feedback and consistent encouragement , as well as sanjib sharma for his assistance .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous reviewer , for drawing attention to several items of recent work and whose comments helped us significantly improve this paper .",

    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
