    "hd 70642b joins 47 uma c ( fischer et al . 2002 ) as the only planets yet found in an approximately circular ( e @xmath18 0.1 ) orbit beyond 3 au .",
    "prior to the discovery of extrasolar planets , planetary systems were predicted to be architecturally similar to the solar system ( lissauer 1995 ; boss 1995 ) , with giant planets orbiting beyond 4 au in circular orbits , and terrestrial mass planets inhabiting the inner few au .",
    "the landscape revealed by the first @xmath380 extrasolar planets is quite different .",
    "extrasolar planetary systems have proven to be much more diverse than imagined , as predicted by lissauer ( 1995 ) , `` the variety of planets and planetary systems in our galaxy must be immense and even more difficult to imagine and predict than was the diversity of the outer planet satellites prior to the voyager mission . ''",
    "the discovery here of a jupiter  mass planet in a circular orbit highlights the existence , but also the rarity , of giant planets that seem similar to the original theoretical predictions .",
    "review of all the known extrasolar planets , both those described in refereed , published journals ( @xmath19 ) and those in the larger list of claimed extrasolar planets ( @xmath20 ) shows that @xmath37% of extrasolar planets orbiting beyond 0.5 au reside in circular orbits ( @xmath210.1 ) .",
    "further detections of planets beyond 1 au are needed to determine if circular orbits are more common for planets that orbit farther from the host star .    over the next decade",
    "precision doppler programs will continue to be the primary means of detecting planets orbiting stars within 50 parsecs . by the end of this decade",
    ", doppler programs carried out at precisions of 3 or better by our group , and by others ( e.g. , mayor & santos 2002 ) , will be sensitive to jupiter and saturn  mass planets orbiting beyond 4 au .",
    "the central looming question is whether these planets will commonly be found in circular orbits , or if the architecture of the solar system is rare .    of the greatest anthropocentric interest",
    "are planets in intrinsically circular orbits , as opposed to the short period planets in tidally circularized orbits .",
    "nasa and esa have made plans for new telescopes to detect terrestrial mass planets .",
    "transit missions such as corot , kepler and eddington may be sensitive to terrestrial mass planets orbiting near 1 au , providing valuable information on the incidence of such planets .",
    "as terrestrial planets make photometric signatures of 1 part in 10,000 , these missions may be subject to interpretive difficulties that already challenge current ground  based transit searches for jupiter ",
    "sized planets .",
    "transit missions can not determine orbital eccentricity , and thus can not determine if planets are solar system analogs .",
    "these space  based transit missions are targeting stars at several hundred parsecs , making follow  up by other techniques difficult .",
    "ground  based interferometric astrometry programs at keck and vlt are projected to begin taking data by the end of this decade .",
    "these programs are complementary to existing precision doppler velocity programs in that they are most sensitive to planets in distant orbits . like doppler velocities",
    ", astrometry needs to observe one or more complete orbits to make a secure detection and solve for orbital parameters .",
    "it is thus likely that the first significant crop of ground  based astrometry planets will emerge after 2015 .",
    "the nasa space interferometry mission ( sim ) is scheduled to launch in 2009 .",
    "a key objective of the sim mission is the detection of planets as small as 3 earth ",
    "masses in 1 au orbits around the nearest stars .",
    "sim offers the promise of determining actual masses of terrestrial planets , thereby securing their status unambiguously .",
    "simulations based on the sim measurement specifications , along with the proposed target stars , the 5 year mission lifetime , and a planet mass function extrapolated to the earth  mass regime , yield predictions that as many as @xmath35 terrestrial planets could be found ( ford & tremaine 2003 ) .",
    "giant planets orbiting 25 au from the host stars are also detectable with sim , though the orbital parameters will not be not well determined in a 5 year mission .",
    "a 10 year sim mission yields significantly better orbital determination for jupiter  analogs .",
    "overall the detection capabilities of sim are similar to existing precision doppler programs with a precision of 3 ( ford & tremaine 2003 ) , thereby providing confirmation of known planets and unambiguous masses .    direct imaging missions such as the nasa terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) and the esa darwin mission have the primary goal of detecting earth  like planets and obtaining low resolution spectra that might reveal biomarkers .",
    "such missions will not return dynamical information and hence will not directly reveal the masses of detected planets .",
    "current plans call for the launching of such missions around 2015 , perhaps optimistically .",
    "we expect that continued doppler measurements , as well as future astrometric missions , will contribute significantly to the interpretation of the unresolved companions detected by tpf / darwin .",
