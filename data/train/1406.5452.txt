    "synchronization phenomena are commonly found in natural sciences as well as in engineering .",
    "because indeed nature is rich in connections , interactions and communications , it is often found that nonlinear systems are made of several subsystems which interact with each other .",
    "several works have thus been carried out on synchronization of chaotic systems . among them",
    ", one can cite the pioneering work of @xcite , and other very important contributions in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "synchronization by means of _ state observers _ has been early discussed in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "state observers are presented as _ slave _ systems which synchronize with a _ master _ system . in subsequent works , such as in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "state observers have been used to further deal with a _",
    "parameter - mismatching _ between the synchronizing systems .",
    "it indeed appears that the estimation of parameters during synchronization can be addressed by the use of _ adaptive _ observers .",
    "such observers usually requires some specific excitation ( so - called _ persistent excitation _ ) for a guarantee of convergence , and an idea in those works was that chaotic behaviours can be expected to provide such an excitation .    in the present paper ,",
    "following the same idea , we propose to use a new observer for the purpose of parameter estimation and synchronization of chaotic systems : this observer combines the well - known extended kalman filter ( ekf ) @xcite , with the high gain technique originally proposed in @xcite for so - called _ uniformly observable _ systems .",
    "in fact , the proposed observer derives from an observer presented in @xcite which is not specific to such uniformly observable systems , in the sense that it can be used for systems with _ singular _",
    "inputs w.r.t .",
    "observability , provided that some excitation condition is satisfied .",
    "this observer design further requires a specific structure of the underlying state - space representation .",
    "the purpose here is to show that for various classical chaotic systems such an appropriate structure can indeed be obtained when extending the state vector with the parameters to be estimated , by means of an _ immersion _ methodology presented in @xcite .",
    "it is then checked by simulations that the observer convergence is obtained , achieving synchronization with parameter estimation .",
    "section 2 presents the proposed observer , while section 3 provides some illustrative examples .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the proposed observer is based on a state - space representation with the structure below : @xmath0 where the involved matrices read as : @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "+ from this structure , it can be seen that the system is not necessarily _ uniformly observable _ , namely its observability depends on the inputs .",
    "+ for the observer convergence , a specific excitation condition will then be required , defined in terms of inputs as follows :    [ def : re ] an input function @xmath10 is said to be locally regular for a system ( [ eq : sysaffp ] ) if there exist @xmath11 , @xmath12 such that for all @xmath13 all @xmath14 and all @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 with @xmath20 denoting the output trajectory of system under input @xmath10 when starting from state @xmath21 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 denoting the identity matrix in @xmath24 .",
    "it has already been shown that with such an excitation , and under the usual technical ( lipschitz ) assumption for a high gain design , one can obtain asymptotic estimation of the state for system ( [ eq : sysaffp ] ) with some _ high - gain kalman - like _ observer @xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper , a modified version will be instead considered , recovering equations of a classical extended - kalman - filter type but with a guarantee of convergence .",
    "this is done in the same spirit as the so - called _ high - gain ekf _ proposed in @xcite or discussed in @xcite for the particular case of _ uniformly observable _ structures , but extended to our case of possibly _ non uniformly observable _ systems : +    [ theo : obs ] under the excitation condition of definition  [ def : re ] , with @xmath10 bounded and making @xmath25 bounded , if @xmath26 is globally lipschitz in @xmath27 uniformly in @xmath10 , then an exponential observer can be designed as follows : for every @xmath28 , there exist @xmath29 such that the system : @xmath30s\\\\ \\nonumber&+&s[a(u , y)+db_\\lambda(u,\\hat z)]^t - sc^t(u)c(u)s)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 as in ( [ eq : gramian - like ] ) , @xmath32 , and initial conditions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , ensures : @xmath35    this result can be established with similar arguments as in @xcite on the one hand , and @xcite on the other hand , basically using two technical results : +    [ lem ] consider @xmath36 as in theorem [ theo : obs ] , with the same assumptions holding true .",
    "+ then @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .    from this",
    ", a lyapunov function can be built for the error system : +    [ lem2 ] consider @xmath36 as in theorem [ theo : obs ] , with the same assumptions holding true .",
    "+ then if @xmath42 stands for the observation error , @xmath43 is a lyapunov function for the error system , satisfying @xmath44 for @xmath45 large enough and a strictly positive increasing function @xmath46 , along the trajectories of @xmath47 .    from this , and standard lyapunov arguments , the result of theorem [ theo : obs ]",
    "is obtained .",
    "+ in short , lemma [ lem ] can be established by inspection of solutions for @xmath36 in equation ( [ eq : obs ] ) , and lemma [ lem2 ] by direct computation of @xmath48 along trajectories of @xmath47 , while full details of the proof are presented in @xcite .",
    "in this section it will be shown how the observer of theorem [ theo : obs ] can be applied to estimate states and parameters in a few typical chaotic systems .",
    "for each system , the conception of its observer begins with the inclusion of its parameters and states into an extended state vector of a new system .",
    "+ it is then shown how this new system can be turned into the suitable form for the proposed observer design , by using the immersion procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the observer gains are finally tuned by the parameters of the adaptive law given in theorem 1 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "both parameters allow to tune the observer rate of convergence .    as a first example",
    ", a unified chaotic system ( ucs ) is considered with a single unknown parameter , whereas the second example takes into account the lorenz and rssler systems with two unknown parameters . in both cases ,",
    "the design procedure is meticulously described and some figures are given to expose simulation results .",
    "a system which unifies the lorenz , chen and l systems is proposed in @xcite .",
    "this system is called unified chaotic system and it is expressed by the following equations : @xmath51    system ( [ ucs ] ) admits :    * the lorenz attractor if @xmath52 . *",
    "the chen attractor if @xmath53 * the l attractor if @xmath54    in what follows , an observer with the structure given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : obs ] ) is proposed in order to estimate the parameter @xmath46 and the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 from the available state @xmath57 .",
    "to do this task , system ( [ ucs ] ) must be changed into the adequate form given by ( [ eq : sysaffp ] ) .",
    "thus , fixing @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the following system is the desired version of ( [ ucs ] ) to design the observer : @xmath62z\\ ] ] @xmath63\\ ] ] for the simulation tests , the observer was tuned with @xmath64 , @xmath65 et @xmath66 .",
    "the results of the tests are presented in fig .",
    "[ ucsparameters ] , where it can be appreciated the good performance of the observer to estimate different values of @xmath46 ( @xmath67 , @xmath53 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "so - called lorenz and rssler equations are well - known chaotic systems with typical attractors in nonlinear sciences .",
    "they are expressed by the ordinary differential equations summarized in table [ systems ] .",

    "[ parameterslorenzt3 ] illustrates the good estimation realized by the lorenz observer , while fig .",
    "[ parametersrosslert3 ] shows the estimation results of the rssler system .",
    "in this work an approach to the problem of state and parameter reconstruction in several chaotic systems has been proposed .",
