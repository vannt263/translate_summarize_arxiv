    "ultracold atomic gases or bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in the optical lattice ( ol ) provide a unique opportunity for quantum simulation of many - body systems and realization of quantum computation and high - precision atomic clock  @xcite . by now , most of these studies focus on the bloch state with a certain single quasi - momentum , where the atomic momentum distribution is characterized by interference peaks with interval @xmath0 which is the double recoil momentum of the atoms in an ol , with @xmath1 the wave vector of the laser forming the ol .",
    "however , the atomic momentum distribution for a superposed state with quasi - momenta spreading in the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) of an ol is seldom studied .    the difficulties to study this superposed state lie in preparation of this state .",
    "in this paper we first load the atoms in the superposed bloch state of s and d bands with zero quasi - momentum by nonadiabatic shortcut method within tens of microseconds .",
    "then the becs are maintained in the ol and a harmonic trap for as long as @xmath2ms .",
    "because of the collisions between atoms , the atoms in d - band transfer to s - band gradually , and in s - band there appears the superposed state of bloch states with quasi - momenta varying from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in the fbz .",
    "after we experimentally prepare the initial state in which the momentum distribution is a gaussian - like shape , we demonstrate the different patterns with the narrower interval by manipulation of the ol standing wave pulse .",
    "these peaks with interval less than the double recoil momentum come from the superposition of states with different quasi - momenta , which is useful for measurement with much higher contrast such as the atom interferometer  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : preparation ] , we give the method for preparing the superposition of bloch states in s - band with quasi - momenta spreading in the fbz . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory_manipulation ] , a single bloch state is compared with the superposed state of many bloch states , and theory for the manipulation of the superposed state is provided . in sec .",
    "[ sec : design ] , we demonstrate the experimental and theoretical results of the momentum patterns with narrower interval . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion_conclusion ] , we show the method for further increasing contrast of the patterns and conclude the paper .",
    "there are adiabatic  @xcite and nonadiabatic  @xcite methods to load becs into an ol as the bloch state with a single quasi - momentum . to get the initial superposed state , we prepare becs of @xmath5rb in a hybrid trap which is formed by the overlap of a single - beam optical dipole trap with the wave length @xmath6 nm and a quadruple magnetic trap .",
    "the condensate of about @xmath7 atoms with the temperature @xmath8nk is achieved with the harmonic trapping frequencies @xmath9(28hz , 55hz , 65hz ) , respectively . then using shortcut control method  @xcite we load the becs into the state @xmath10 with the quasi - momentum being zero , after evolution in two pulses consisting of ol pulses and intervals @xmath11 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_sequences](a ) .",
    "the lattice is produced by a standing wave created by two counter - propagating laser beams with lattice constant @xmath12 nm along @xmath13 axis .",
    "we numerically calculate the pulses by modulating the parameters about the duration @xmath14 and the interval @xmath15 for the @xmath16th pulse .",
    "this loading process has above @xmath17 fidelity  @xcite with @xmath18s for the ol depth @xmath19 being @xmath20 .",
    "then we maintain becs in the ol and the harmonic trap for as long as @xmath2ms . because of the collisions between atoms , the atoms in d - band transfer to s - band gradually , and in s - band there appear atoms with quasi - momenta spreading in fbz .",
    "it is crucial to choose an appropriate holding time of the ol , denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "when the time is short , the momentum components will oscillate versus the time  @xcite .",
    "however , for too long holding time , the system would be heating . by choosing @xmath22ms",
    ", we obtain a superposed state of s - band bloch states with quasi - momenta varying from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "ms holding time in the ol and the harmonic trap , the state becomes the superposition of the bloch states in s - band with quasi - momenta spreading in fbz , and is denoted by @xmath23",

    "[ fig : time_sequences](a ) , the absorption images after @xmath28ms time - of - flight ( tof ) of becs are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_sequences](b ) for @xmath25 and @xmath2ms , which give the atomic density distribution in different bands .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath2ms holding time the atoms are almost spreading in the fbz corresponding to the s - band , which is from the collisions during the holding time .",
    "it is well known that the bloch state has a periodical density distribution in coordinate space , and a discrete momentum component with interval @xmath0 . however , what happens for the superposition of many bloch states with different quasi - momenta ? to find out the answer , we study the superposition of bloch wave functions in s - band given by : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the quasi - momentum ( @xmath31 is the plank constant ) , @xmath32 corresponds to the s - band , @xmath33 is the proportional coefficient of the bloch state @xmath34 , and satisfies @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the difference between two adjacent quasi - momenta . by setting @xmath37 for convenience ,",
    "we choose the initial state as : @xmath38 with @xmath39 the number of the quasi - momenta in the summation among the fbz .",

    "( d ) the momentum distributions of the two states.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    then we design the standing wave pulse imposing on this superposed state which is similar to the kapitza - dirac ( kd ) scattering of matter waves , which is a very powerful and versatile tool for the coherent splitting and mixing of momentum modes  @xcite , and has been studied widely both in theory  @xcite and in experiments  @xcite . for the bloch state with a single quasi - momentum ,",
    "the effect of a sequence of ol standing wave pulses is superposition of different bloch states with certain coefficients at the fixed quasi - momentum .",
    "therefore , the resulting state has the peaks with @xmath0 interval in momentum space just as the the red dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : initial_state](d ) . however , it is entirely different for the superposed state of bloch states with different quasi - momenta in the fbz .",
    "we found that there appears an atomic momentum pattern with narrower interval between the adjacent peaks that can be chosen to be far less than the double recoil momentum .    to understand the action of the pulses on @xmath23 , we start with the hamiltonian : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the atomic mass , @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath62 corresponds to different reciprocal momentum ( @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 represents s , p , and d - band , etc . with definite evolution time @xmath47 and @xmath65 , we can get figure of the probability versus the momentum .    by calculating the coefficient @xmath66",
    ", we learn that for terms with @xmath67 , the coefficient @xmath66 is small enough , so we neglect these terms . besides , the probability of momenta transformation between @xmath68 and @xmath0 is far less than the probability between @xmath0 ( or @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 ,",
    "so we can ignore the terms including @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : p_2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , for the initial state beginning from s - band , the probability of transformation between p - band and d - band is far less than the probability between s - band and p - band ( or d - band ) , and thus the terms with @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be neglected .",

    "( [ eqn : p_2 ] ) , it is clear that the probability @xmath95 is the combination of disparate oscillations with different frequencies .",

    "for different momenta , the probabilities reach maximum at different time intervals . therefore ,",
