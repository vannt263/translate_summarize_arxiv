    "conclusion      matrix theory and calculus are two classical and fundamental mathematical tools in modern science and technology .",
    "there are two mostly used operators on the set of matrices : conventional matrix product and matrix addition .",
    "roughly speaking , the object of matrix theory is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of all matrices .",
    "unfortunately , unlike the arithmetic system @xmath10 , in matrix theory both  @xmath11 \" and  @xmath12 \" are restricted by the matrix dimensions . precisely speaking :",
    "consider two matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "then the  product \" , @xmath15 , is well posed , if and only if , @xmath16 ; the  addition \" @xmath17 , is defined , if and only if , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "though there are some other matrix products such as kronecker product , hadamard product etc . , but they are of different stories @xcite .    the main purpose of this paper is to develop a new matrix theory , which intendes to overcome the dimension barrier by extending the matrix product and matrix addition to two matrices which do not meet the classical dimension requirement . as generalizations of the classical ones , they should be consistent with the classical definitions .",
    "that is , when the dimension requirements of two argument matrices in classical matrix theory are satisfied , the newly defined operators should coincide with the original one .",
    "because of the extension of the two fundamental operators , many related concepts can be extended .",
    "for instance , the characteristic functions , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix can be extended to certain non - square matrices ; lei algebraic structure can also be extended to dimension - varying square matrices .",
    "all these extensions should be consistent with the classical ones . in one word",
    ", we are developing the classical matrix theory but not violating any of the original matrix theory .    when we were developing the extended operators we meet a serious problem :",
    "though the extended operators are applicable to certain sets of matrices with different dimensions , they fail to be vector space anymore .",
    "this drawback is not acceptable , because it blocked the way to extend many nice algebraic or geometric structures in matrix theory , such as lie algebraic structure , manifold structure etc .",
    ", to the enlarged set , which includes matrices of different dimensions . to overcome this obstacle , we introduced certain equivalence relations .",
    "then the quotient spaces , called the equivalence spaces , become vector spaces .",
    "two equivalence relations have been proposed .",
    "they are _ matrix equivalence _ ( me ) and _ vector equivalence _ ( ve ) .    then many nice algebraic and geometric structures have been developed on the matrix equivalence spaces .",
    "they are briefly introduced as follows :    * lattice structure : the elements in each equivalent class form a lattice .",
    "the class of spaces with different dimensions also form a lattice .",
    "the former and the latter are homomorphic .",
    "the lattices obtained for me and ve are isomorphic .",
    "* topological structure : a topological structure is proposed to the equivalence space , which is built using topological sub - base .",
    "it is then proved that under this topology the equivalence space is hausdorff ( @xmath20 ) space and is second countable . *",
    "inner product structure : an inner product is proposed on the equivalence space . the norm ( distance ) is also obtained . it is proved that the topology induced by this norm is the same as the topology produced by using topological sub - base .",
    "* fiber bundle structure .",
    "a fiber bundle structure is proposed for the set of matrices ( as total space ) and the equivalent classes ( as base space ) .",
    "the bundle structure is named the discrete bundle , because each fiber has discrete topology . *",
    "bundle manifold structure : a ( dimension - varying ) manifold structure is proposed for the equivalence space .",
    "its coordinate charts are constructed via the discrete bundle .",
    "hence it is called a bundled manifold .",
    "* bundled lie algebraic structure : a lie algebra structure is proposed for the equivalence space .",
    "the lie algebra is of infinite dimensional , but almost all the properties of finite dimensional lie algebras remain available . *",
    "bundled lie group structure : for the equivalence classes of square nonsingular matrices a group structure is proposed .",
    "it has also the dimension - varying manifold structure .",
    "both algebraic and geometric structures are consistent and hence it becomes a lie group .",
    "the relationship of this lie group with the bundled lie algebra is also investigated .    under vector equivalence ,",
    "all the vectors form a vector space @xmath0 , and any matrix @xmath1 can be considered as an linear operator on @xmath0 .",
    "a very important class of @xmath1 , called the bounded operator , is investigated in details . for a bounded operator @xmath1 , which could be non - square",
    ", its characteristic function is proposed .",
    "its eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector are obtained .",
    "@xmath1-invariant subspace has been discussed in detail .",
    "this work is motivated by the semi - tensor product ( stp ) .",
    "the stp of matrices was proposed firstly and formally in 2001 @xcite .",
    "then it has been used to some newton differential dynamic systems and their control problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a basic summarization was given in @xcite .",
    "since 2008 , stp has been used to formulate and analyze boolean networks as well as general logical dynamic systems , and to solve control problems for those systems .",
    "it has then been developed rapidly .",
    "this is witnessed by hundreds of research papers .",
    "a multitude of applications of stp include ( i ) logical dynamic systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( ii ) systems biology @xcite , @xcite ; ( iii ) graph theory and formation control @xcite , @xcite ; ( iv ) circuit design and failure detection @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( v ) game theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( vi ) finite automata and symbolic dynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( vii ) coding and cryptography @xcite , @xcite ; ( viii ) fuzzy control @xcite , @xcite ; ( ix ) some engineering applications @xcite , @xcite ; and many other topics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; just to name a few .    as a generalization of conventional matrix product , stp",
    "is applicable to two matrices of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in addition , this generalization keeps all fundamental properties of conventional matrix product available .",
    "therefore , it becomes a very conventional tool for investigating many matrix computation related problems .",
    "up to this time , the main effort has been put on its applications . now",
    "when we start to explore the mathematical foundation of stp , we found that the most significant characteristic of stp is that it overcomes the dimension barrier .",
    "after serious thought , it can be seen that in fact stp is defined on equivalent classes .",
    "following this thought of train , the matrix theory on equivalence space emerges .",

    "<S> the lattice structure has been established for each equivalence . under each equivalence , the corresponding quotient space becomes a vector space . under matrix equivalence </S>",
    "<S> , many algebraic , geometric , and analytic structures have been posed to the quotient space , which include ( i ) lattice structure ; ( ii ) inner product and norm ( distance ) ; ( iii ) topology ; ( iv ) a fiber bundle structure , called the discrete bundle ; ( v ) bundled differential manifold ; ( vi ) bundled lie group and lie algebra . under vector space equivalence , vectors of different dimensions form a vector space @xmath0 , and a matrix @xmath1 of arbitrary dimension is considered as an operator ( linear mapping ) on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 is a bounded operator ( not necessarily square but includes square matrices as a special case ) , the generalized characteristic function , eigenvalue and eigenvector etc . </S>",
    "<S> are defined .    in one word </S>",
    "<S> , this new matrix theory overcomes the dimensional barrier in certain sense . </S>",
    "<S> it provides much more freedom for using matrix approach to practical problems .    </S>",
