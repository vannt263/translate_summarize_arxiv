    "many present - day galaxies can be found in group environments where tidal interactions within these systems play important roles in galactic dynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "certain interactions in gas - rich groups can form tidal bridges and tails as well as second - generation  tidal \" dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) , which differ from first - generation `` pre - existing '' dwarfs by their lack of dark matter and higher metallicity content @xcite . since tdgs form from the material from the outer disks of larger galaxies",
    ", they should have total to baryonic mass ratios close to unity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "not only do tdgs contain populations of recently formed stars that were produced during the interaction event , but they also have older pre - enriched stellar populations @xcite .",
    "overall , the formation of any tidal feature or galaxy greatly constrains the type of interaction and the properties of the original objects involved in the process @xcite . in groups , the prevalence of tidal galaxies relative to their pre - existing counterparts probes the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution in these environments @xcite .",
    "although tdgs are frequently produced in galaxy interaction simulations and over the last two decades several probable candidates have been identified in @xmath020 interacting systems , very few of these objects have been widely accepted as authentic ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "tidally formed knots that assemble along tidal filaments tend to have total masses between @xmath6 m@xmath3 and @xmath7 m@xmath3 ; however , in order to survive into long - lived dwarf galaxies  with life - times @xmath8 gyr ",
    "these objects typically require a total mass @xmath9 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "models predict that the most probable tdgs are found in the high density tips of tidal tails where large tidal knots are typically formed @xcite .",
    "genuine tdgs should also be self - gravitating @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even high - resolution studies of the neutral hydrogen ( h  ) dynamics of well - known tdg candidates in the southern tail of ngc 4038/9 failed to prove that the objects are rotating  a clear indicator of self - gravitation  and that they are therefore kinematically distinct from the tidal tail , which has given rise to much debate and speculation about their nature @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , deciding whether a given object is a tidal dwarf or not is a non trivial issue and generally requires a host of corroborating observations .",
    "given the properties of ( young ) tdgs as well as the environments within which they form , h   observations are a reasonable preliminary search tool .",
    "h   traces the location of tidally formed features , can indicate regions of potential star formation and has been routinely used to map the gas distribution in and around gas - rich systems ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for recent examples ) .",
    "h   measurements can be used to estimate gas masses and total masses ( discussed further in @xmath10 4 ) . with sufficient resolution , the internal structure and dynamics of tdg candidates",
    "can also be constrained @xcite .",
    "interferometric data from instruments such as the very large array ( vla ; e.g.  @xcite ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; e.g.  @xcite ) become essential for resolving the structure of more compact features .",
    "the faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey ( figgs ; @xcite ) shows that the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) is also particularly useful in surveying gas - rich dwarfs as its fixed antenna configuration allows for maps at different angular resolutions to be produced by tapering the data during imaging .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to interferometric h   mapping of nearby interacting systems in order to search for tdgs ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , none are blind in their approach : only the regions most likely to harbour second - generation objects were studied in detail , thus probing a incomplete view of the dwarf galaxy population in the groups . by contrast , single - dish surveys such as the h   parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ; @xcite ) , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; @xcite ) and those using the green bank telescope ( gbt ; e.g.  @xcite ) can efficiently cover the large sky areas needed to characterize group environments but lack the angular resolution to probe the structure of individual objects .",
    "an unbiased census of tdgs in nearby groups is therefore enabled by a two - pronged approach : sensitive single - dish observations to locate h  -bearing systems on degree scales and high - resolution interferometric follow - up to elucidate their origin . in this paper , we target low - mass alfalfa h   detections in the nearby gas - rich group ngc 3166/9 with the gmrt affording one of the first blind , systematic studies of both first- and second- generation systems in a group environment .",
    "ngc 3166/9 consists of three main spiral galaxies : ngc 3165 , ngc 3166 and ngc 3169 and is located in the sextans constellation .",
    "the heliocentric velocity difference between these galaxies is small  @xmath11 = 1340 @xmath12 5 km",
    "s@xmath13 @xcite , 1345 @xmath12 5 km s@xmath13 @xcite and 1238 @xmath12 4 km s@xmath13 @xcite for ngc 3165 , ngc 3166 and ngc 3169 respectively  and they share a common h   distribution at arcminute resolution ( see below ) .",
    "the close proximity of these galaxies to one another as well as a tail - like feature extending below ngc 3166 in the ultraviolet ( uv ; discussed in @xmath10 5 ) , indicates previous and on - going interactions within the group .",
    "the average distance to ngc 3169 , derived from the type 1a supernova sn2003cg , is 22.6 mpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is assumed for all group members throughout this paper .",
    "recently , the extended h   emission of this group , first observed by @xcite , was mapped at 4@xmath14 ( 30 kpc at the distance of ngc 3169 ) resolution by alfalfa ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ alfa ] ) .",
    "we present the alfalfa data for the ncg 3166/9 region in @xmath10 2 .",
    "most of the detected h   is located around ngc 3169 with various features extending outwards ; however , the spatial resolution of the alfalfa data is too low to characterize the structure of individual group members .",
    "the high h   content and clear signs of interactions in the ngc 3166/9 group make it an ideal candidate for high - resolution follow - up to distinguish first- and second - generation objects , which should result in a better understanding of galaxy evolution in groups .",
    "we obtained interferometric h   observations using the gmrt , as a follow - up to the alfalfa data , in an attempt to resolve the putative dwarf galaxy population in ngc 3166/9 .",
    "we have been able to make higher resolution maps of the h   features resulting in the detection of several low - mass objects ( @xmath10 4 ) .",
    "we computed h   masses and total masses , from the gmrt data , for each detection ( @xmath10 4 ) .",
    "stellar masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) were also estimated for each object using ancillary optical and uv observations ( @xmath10 5 ) .",
    "the combination of mass ratio estimates , sfrs and other galactic properties have been used to categorize the low - mass h   features and identify a probable tdg in our neutral / blind survey of the gas - rich objects in ngc 3166/9 ( @xmath10 6 ) .",
    "alfalfa mapping of the ngc 3166/9 group was completed during spring 2009 .",
    "the alfalfa data acquisition and reduction strategy are described in detail in @xcite and references therein .",
    "processing of the ngc 3166/9 data was carried out as described in @xcite but the resulting h   detections were not included in the alfalfa 40% catalogue ( @xmath15.40 ) presented in that paper because ngc 3166/9 lies outside the @xmath15.40 sky footprint .",
    "we therefore present the alfalfa detections in the ngc 3166/9 region here .    a total intensity h   map of the emission detected by alfalfa in the ngc 3166/9 region is shown in fig .  [ alfa ] .",
    "alfalfa detects an extended h   envelope around ngc 3165 , ngc 3166 and ngc 3169 with a maximum diameter of 40@xmath14 ( 300 kpc ) at column densities n@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 , as well as several sources in the periphery with @xmath19 km s@xmath13 .",

    "sources c1 to c5 , p1 and p2 all have gas masses and dynamical to gas mass ratios similar to several dirrs found in the lg ; whereas , the tdg candidates have comparatively higher gas contents and lower mass ratios . the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lg ] shows that lg dirrs generally have minimal amounts of current star formation with the exception of ic 10 , which exhibits complex kinematics , a disturbed outer h   velocity field and an unusually high sfr that suggests an ongoing interaction @xcite . due to the similarity of ( and uncertainty in )",
    "their sfrs ( table  [ final ] ) , sources c1 to c5 are represented by a single point .",
    "most of our detections have values corresponding to sfrs of lg dirrs while the tdg candidates appear to have slightly higher sfrs .",
    "the value of @xmath92 for c5 is similar to that of typical dirrs .",
    "the low stellar to gas mass ratio and smooth lobed structure of c5 indicates that it has not been affected by the interaction between the larger ngc galaxies ; whereas , c4 appears to have been significantly affected by the gravity of ngc 3169 , which has resulted in a fairly low gas mass and very turbulent gas motions for the object .",
    "judging by their spatial and spectral distribution as well as their proximity to ncg 3169 , there is a possibility that c1 , c2 and c3 are located in a gaseous tail of tidal origin ; however , according to @xcite , with @xmath66 @xmath93 @xmath33 these objects are unlikely to be long - lived and would be classified as transient tidal knots , which will eventually fall back onto their progenitor . in this context , it is likely that sources c1 to c4 are not self - gravitating and therefore that their dynamical mass estimates in table 4 have no physical meaning .",
    "the apparent signs of current and previous star formation as well as their potential involvement with ngc 3166/9 warrants more detailed study of probable dirrs p1 and p2 that should lead to a better understanding of galaxy pre - processing around group environments ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the tdg candidate in ngc 3166/9 exhibits the typical dynamical signatures of other likely second - generation dwarfs ( see fig .",
    "the channel maps in fig .",
    "[ chan ] show that the velocity of this object defines its clear association with the tidal tail that extends below ngc 3166 . at the same time , it is clearly distinct from the tail in h   and optical brightness as well as in morphology .",
    "its high gas mass content , @xmath94 @xmath33 , and a low dynamical to gas mass ratio , @xmath92 = @xmath95 , is in agreement with the properties of predicted and observed tidally formed dwarf galaxies ( i.e. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the tdg candidate appears to have a very faint optical component in fig .",
    "[ mom_tdg]a and the associated uv emission in fig .",
    "[ tail_tdg ] suggests that there is a population of newly formed stars .",
    "recent simulations and observations suggest that at least some tdgs should show signs of rotation @xcite",
    ". there does appear to be some form of coherent motion within the tdg candidate in ngc 3166/9 in fig .",
    "[ mom_tdg]b ; however , a velocity gradient that is consistent with rotation is not confirmed and the amplitude of its velocity width ( @xmath96 km s@xmath13 ) is similar to the velocity dispersion across the object implied by the second velocity moment map in fig .",
    "[ mom_tdg]c .",
    "these results suggest that the tdg is not rotationally supported , contrary to other h  -rich tdgs so far studied in the literature and the predictions from simulations @xcite .",
    "the lack of clear rotation does reflect the findings for other tdg candidates ( such as that in ngc 4038/9 ; @xcite ) ; whereas , the few tdg candidates that do show convincing signs of rotation are significantly more massive than the one reported in this paper ( see @xcite ) . only in this respect",
    "do the properties of the tdg candidate differ from some model predictions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , its location at the tip of a tidal tail , its gas and stellar content , its sfr and most importantly its baryon fraction are all consistent with both simulations and the properties of other tdg candidates , which strongly suggest a tidal origin for this object .",
    "additional observations  such as optical spectroscopy to estimate metallicity and confirm a rotational velocity gradient as well as deep optical imaging to better probe stellar populations  are needed verify the hypothesis that the tdg candidate discussed here is indeed a second - generation dwarf ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations constrained to reproduce the global h   properties of the ngc 3166/9 group could also provide insight into the origin of the system .",
    "we are exploring all of these potential avenues for ngc 3166/9 as well as other gas - rich groups probed by alfalfa as part of a larger campaign to determine both the prevalence and properties of tidally formed structures in nearby group environments .",
