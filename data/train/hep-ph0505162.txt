    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe may be expressed in terms of the ratio of the baryon density @xmath0 to the entropy density @xmath1 of the universe .",
    "the agreement between astrophysical observations and primordial nucleosynthesis calculations constrains this ratio to the range at @xmath2 c.l .",
    "@xcite : @xmath3 which is in good agreement with the inferred from cosmic microwave background data , particularly that provided by wmap  @xcite .",
    "almost 40 years ago , sakharov explained how this baryon asymmetry could be obtained via a microphysical mechanism incorporating interactions that violate baryon and/or lepton number , violate c and cp , and drop out of equilibrium in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "since such interactions are present in the electroweak theory and its extensions , the baryon asymmetry might have originated at any energy above the electroweak scale .",
    "one of the most attractive and simple ways to realize the sakharov mechanism is high - scale leptogenesis through the out - of - equilibrium decays of a heavy majorana neutrino , since it arises naturally within the seesaw mechanism for generating light neutrino masses @xcite . however , high - scale leptogenesis and the seesaw mechanism are difficult to test directly , since the natural scale of the interactions of the heavy majorana neutrino is in the range @xmath4 gev to @xmath5 gev .",
    "this is impossible to reach by accelerators , except indirectly via renormalization effects on light particle masses , for example .",
    "baryogenesis at the electroweak scale itself is certainly a most attractive option@xcite , because it may be tested directly , if it can be achieved economically .",
    "however , this option is now excluded in the standard model , because the unsuccessful lep searches require the higgs boson to be too heavy for the electroweak phase transition to have been first - order , and the effective amount of cp violation is in any case very small @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an electroweak mechanism may be possible in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , but at the price of a certain number of rather restrictive conditions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to look for other scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "an additional problem with any supersymmetric model that postulates high temperatures in the early universe is that of the gravitino abundance @xcite .",
    "thermal production of gravitinos at high temperatures in the very early universe might have exceeded the bounds imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the context of supersymmetry , it is doubly interesting to look for alternative baryogenesis scenarios that operate at lower energy scales below about a tev , which might be tested directly in the foreseeable future .",
    "it has recently been proposed that soft supersymmetry - breaking breaking terms comprising bilinear and trilinear scalar couplings involving the right - handed sneutrino fields could be responsible for leptogenesis , an option referred to as soft leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to standard leptogenesis from heavy majorana ( s)neutrino decay , in soft leptogenesis the cp violation needed can be provided within the framework of a single sneutrino generation . however , even if this mechanism of leptogenesis could evade the gravitino problem , it is still difficult to probe in laboratory experiments , because of the high mass scale of the right - handed sneutrino .    in this paper , we propose an alternative leptogenesis mechanism via _ decays of a left - handed sneutrino at a low energy scale_. this scenario may be realized in supersymmetric models with non - zero majorana neutrino masses that lead to mixing and mass splitting between the left - handed sneutrino @xmath6 and the corresponding antisneutrino @xmath7 .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite , the neutrino mass and the sneutrino mass splitting may be due to related @xmath8 interactions , linked by supersymmetry breaking .",
    "as we show below , the @xmath9 system may exhibit oscillatory behaviour analogous to the @xmath10 system .",
    "in addition , soft supersymmetry breaking sectors provide new sources of cp violation in @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing which can generate a lepton asymmetry in the sneutrino decays .",
    "we explore in this paper how the three sakharov conditions  @xcite for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be fulfilled in this restrictive framework .    in the sense",
    "that supersymmetry breaking is the source of leptogenesis , our scenario is similar to soft leptogenesis , but differs in that it operates at the electroweak scale .",
    "if the scenario proposed does become a candidate for leptogenesis , it could in principle be tested in collider experiments via a sneutrino oscillation signal , though this may be difficult in practice .",
    "the lepton number is tagged in the decay of sneutrino by identifying the charge of the outgoing lepton , and a same - sign dilepton signal may be observable when the sneutrino - antisneutrino pairs decay into charged leptons .",
    "however , measurement of a lepton asymmetry would probably need more events than are likely to be provided at the lhc or ilc .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review how to generate the sneutrino mass splitting in a supersymmetric model with a heavy right - handed majorana neutrino superfield and discuss how small the mass splitting can be . in section iii",
    ", we examine how leptogenesis via the decay of the left - handed sneutrino can be realized and in section iv the cp asymmetry generated from the decay of the light sneutrino is considered . in section",
    "v , we discuss possible wash - out processes , which may be harmless for our leptogenesis scenario , and present our conclusions .",
    "we first review in more detail how to generate the sneutrino mass splitting in a supersymmetric model with non - zero majorana neutrino masses , which could arise from a right - handed neutrino superfield .",
    "the relevant superpotential is @xmath11 where @xmath12 are superfields for lepton doublets , heavy right - handed neutrinos and higgs fields , respectively .",
    "the @xmath13 terms are the same as in the mssm .",
    "the relevant terms in the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar potential are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the light and heavy sneutrinos , respectively .",
    "from now on , we consider a single generation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken , the light neutrino acquires a mass via the seesaw mechanism : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "defining @xmath22 one can separate the sneutrino mass - squared matrix into two blocks and then , to first order in @xmath23 , the two light sneutrino eigenstates are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with the following masses - squared , @xmath26 where the mass - squared difference @xmath27 is of order @xmath23 . here , we can remove the phases in the superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) by rotating superfields and the relative phase between @xmath28 and @xmath29 with a r - rotation , but there remains an unremovable phase , which makes @xmath30 complex . the sneutrino mass splitting",
    "is then easily computed by using the relation @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the average of the light sneutrino masses and @xmath33 we note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are of the same order as the electroweak scale , whereas @xmath36 and @xmath29 are soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters associated with the @xmath37 singlet superfield @xmath18 , and may be much larger than the electroweak scale . as one can see from ( [ sp1 ] ) , if @xmath38 , the sneutrino mass splitting is significantly enhanced , whereas it is of the same order as the neutrino mass when @xmath39 .",
    "this mass splitting may in principle be probed through the sneutrino - antisneutrino oscillation which would result in a same - sign dilepton signal .",
    "however , to have an observable rate for the same - sign dilepton signal , the ratio of the mass splitting to the sneutrino decay width should be large , namely , @xmath40 , and the sneutrino branching ratio into a charged lepton should also be large .",
    "we now examine how leptogenesis via the decay of the light sneutrino can be realized in this framework . as is well known , for a successful mechanism of leptogenesis",
    ", we need lepton - number- and cp - violating interactions that should be out of equilibrium , so that the asymmetry generated is not automatically suppressed . in this scenario , as mentioned before , _ sneutrino - antisneutrino mixing is a direct manifestation of lepton - number violation _ , and the _ soft supersymmetry - breaking terms may well provide a suitable new source of cp violation_.    we must then impose the _ out - of - equilibrium condition for the decay of the light sneutrino _ , which is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the decay rate of the sneutrino , @xmath43 is the hubble constant at the decay epoch , and @xmath44 is the planck scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom , which takes the value @xmath46 for the mssm with one generation of right - handed neutrinos .    as well as the out - of - equilibrium condition ( [ out1 ] )",
    ", we must require that the electroweak _ sphaleron interactions are still in thermal equilibrium _ at the time the lepton asymmetry is generated , so that they can convert the lepton asymmetry partially into a baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the temperature at which the sphaleron interactions freeze out depends on how the electroweak phase transition occurs .",
    "it is known that the sphaleron interactions freeze out at the critical temperature of electroweak phase transition if it is strongly first - order , whereas the freeze - out temperature may become lower than the critical temperature if the transition is second - order or weakly first - order . in the latter case ,",
    "the sphaleron interactions freeze out at the temperature at which the sphaleron transition rate @xmath47 becomes equal to the expansion rate of the universe@xcite .",
    "it has been found in numerical simulations that the sphaleron interactions are effective as long as @xmath48 gev .",
    "therefore , for a successful mechanism of leptogenesis , we require 510 ^ -4   _ 1.310 ^ -4()^2   , [ out2 ] where the first condition follows from the sphaleron equilibrium condition and the second from ( [ out1 ] ) for @xmath49 .",
    "as seen in ( [ out2 ] ) , a scenario for leptogenesis can be successful only when @xmath50 gev .",
    "in order to discuss the decays , mixing and cp - violating asymmetries for light sneutrinos , we first integrate out the heavy right - handed neutrino superfield , following which the superpotential for the light sneutrino is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denote the light neutrino , the right - handed charged lepton and the charged higgs superfields , respectively , and @xmath53 stands for the yukawa couplings of the lepton sector , which are given by @xmath54 .",
    "the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms involving the light sneutrinos @xmath15 are ; @xmath55 we note that the effects of the right - handed neutrino superfields are absorbed into the seesaw term in ( [ seesaw2 ] ) and the sneutrino mass splitting @xmath30 discussed previously .",
    "the sneutrino interaction lagrangian is then given by @xmath56 where we have considered a single sneutrino generation and @xmath57 after the electroweak symmetry is broken .    it should be noted that the higgs field @xmath58 is decomposed into the physical higgs sector and the goldstone boson sector . selecting the physical higgs sector in @xmath58 is equivalent to replacing @xmath58 by @xmath59 .",
    "its yukawa coupling therefore becomes @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the charged lepton mass . in the lagrangian for a single generation of sneutrino",
    ", there is a physical cp - violating phase . with superfield rotations and an r - rotation we can eliminate cp phases in the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , but",
    "then the cp - violating phase in @xmath64 can not be removed .    as observed above in ( [ out2 ] ) , the mechanism of low - energy leptogenesis proposed here could be successful only if @xmath65 is of order @xmath66  ev , so it is important to discuss how such a low decay rate might be achieved .",
    "if @xmath67 , which is the ordering of masses generally expected in the mssm with universal soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses ( the cmssm ) , the dominant sneutrino decays are those into two - body final states . as shown in  @xcite , the typical size of @xmath65 for such two - body decays",
    "is @xmath68(gev ) , which is too large to achieve successful leptogenesis .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath69 and no two - body sneutrino decay channels are open , three - body sneutrino decays will dominate .",
    "this mass ordering is possible if the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle , and is also allowed by cosmology and the standard accelerator constraints  @xcite .",
    "the following chargino- and neutralino - mediated three - body decays are then generally dominant : @xmath70 and @xmath71 , assuming that decays into final states containing lighter sneutrinos can be neglected .",
    "assuming that the lightest neutralino is dominated by its bino component , the rates for the chargino- and neutralino - mediated sneutrino decays ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : threebody](a ) for an illustration ) are given by @xcite ( _ ll^-^+_r _ ) & = & , + ( _ l_l_r^^ ) & = & , where the @xmath72 are gaugino mass parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    .",
    "_ , title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "_ , title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to obtain @xmath75  ev , one must require that the @xmath6 and @xmath76 be nearly degenerate .",
    "as an example , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we indeed find @xmath75 ev .",
    "this near - degeneracy between the @xmath76 and @xmath6 is not possible in the cmssm with universal soft scalar masses @xmath80 and gaugino masses @xmath81 at the gut scale , in which the mass difference between the @xmath76 and @xmath6 is approximately @xmath82 . according to the constraints on the parameter space @xmath83 from the cosmological observation , @xmath84 and muon @xmath85 ,",
    "the favoured region of @xmath81 is somewhat large , namely @xmath86 gev , and the @xmath76 is considerably lighter than the @xmath6 @xcite in the cmssm .",
    "thus , we need a non - universal boundary condition on the soft scalar masses at the gut scale .",
    "there is no known theoretical or phenomenological reason why the soft superymmetry - breaking @xmath76 and @xmath6 masses should not differ at the gut scale . at the electroweak scale , @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "can be written as m__r & & m_0r^2 + 0.15m_1/2 ^ 2+^2_w2m_z^2 , + m _ & = & m_0l^2 + 0.54m_1/2 ^ 2 + 1/22m_z^2 , and we can make the physical @xmath87 and @xmath88 nearly degenerate by choosing the soft scalar masses @xmath89 and @xmath90 appropriately .",
    "we now consider mass mixing and cp violation in the @xmath91 system .",
    "since it is analogous to the @xmath92 and @xmath93 systems , we can calculate mixing and cp asymmetries using the formulae derived previously for these meson systems @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the system is determined by a hamiltonian @xmath94 where , to leading order in the soft terms , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total @xmath15 decay width .",
    "the dominant part of the off - diagonal component @xmath97 can be obtained by considering the imaginary part of the loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : threebody](b ) . the analytic expression for @xmath97",
    "is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath43 are then given by @xmath100 where the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 are related by @xmath103 it is appropriate for cosmology to consider an initial state at @xmath104 with equal densities of @xmath15 and @xmath105 . at a later time",
    "@xmath106 , the state will have evolved into @xmath107 here @xmath108 and we have neglected @xmath109 with respect to @xmath110 .",
    "we can then compute the total integrated lepton asymmetry , defined by @xmath111}{\\sum_f\\int^{\\infty}_{0}dt[\\gamma(\\widetilde{\\nu}(t)\\rightarrow f)+\\gamma(\\widetilde{\\nu}^{\\ast}(t)\\rightarrow f)+\\gamma(\\widetilde{\\nu}(t)\\rightarrow \\bar{f})+\\gamma(\\widetilde{\\nu}^{\\ast}(t)\\rightarrow \\bar{f})]}\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|\\frac{q}{p}\\right|^2-\\left|\\frac{p}{q}\\right|^2\\right ) \\frac{\\int^{\\infty}_0dt|g_{-}|^2}{\\int^{\\infty}_0dt(|g_+|^2+|g_-|^2)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 stands for a final state with lepton number equal to one and @xmath113 is its conjugate . calculating ( [ qop ] ) in the limit @xmath114 , we find @xmath115 we notice that @xmath64 is the only complex parameter in this expression .",
    "performing the time integral , we find @xmath116 thus , we obtain the following final expression for the cp asymmetry : @xmath117 the baryon asymmetry is then given by @xcite @xmath118 the first factor takes into account the reprocessing of the @xmath119 asymmetry by sphaleron transitions , with the number of higgs doublets @xmath120 equal to 2 , and @xmath121 is the equilibrium sneutrino density in units of the entropy density for temperatures much larger than @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath123 the efficiency factor @xmath124 includes effects caused by the sneutrino density being smaller than the equilibrium density and wash - out due to the decays not being completely out of equilibrium . the value of @xmath124 must be obtained by integrating the relevant boltzmann equations , but may plausibly be of order unity .    for the value of @xmath125 given in ( 1 ) , we see that that our mechanism should yield @xmath126 .",
    "let us estimate how we can achieve this desirable amount of @xmath127 .",
    "we infer from recent experimental results that a neutrino mass of order @xmath128 ev is possible .",
    "then , we see from ( 5 ) that @xmath129 in the case that the parameters @xmath130 are of the same order as @xmath88 . in this case , the size of the quantity in ( [ ofact ] ) is of order one .",
    "we can also take the parameter @xmath131 to be the same order of @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , we observe that the value of @xmath97 can be enhanced by taking large @xmath132 .",
    "numerically , we find a magnitude of @xmath127 in ( [ cpasym ] ) of order @xmath133 when we take @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and a larger value of @xmath127 could be obtained if needed .",
    "finally , we note that the large sneutrino - antisneutrino mixing which is expected because @xmath136 might lead to an observable like - sign dilepton signal .",
    "this could provide an characteristic collider signature of our scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "the amount of cp violation is likely to be too small to be observable in the near future .",
    "the scenario proposed here needs further investigation . in particular , we recall that successful leptogenesis requires a departure from thermal equilibrium for wash - out processes , as well lepton - number - violating decays .",
    "the dominant wash - out processes are scattering reactions mediated by sneutrinos or charginos and neutralinos . since our scenario",
    "calls for relatively heavy charginos and neutralinos , the scattering rates mediated by charginos and neutralinos are suppressed . additionally , scattering reactions mediated by sneutrinos can occur via the vertices involving charginos or neutralinos . however , the rates of these scattering processes are suppressed due to the boltzmann suppression of the number densities of the charginos and neutralinos .",
    "a more accurate estimation of the lepton asymmetry that survives these wash - out processes could be obtained by solving directly the full boltzmann equations for the system with different sparticle masses , as has been done in many detailed works considering high - scale leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "a similarly detailed study goes beyond the scope of this paper , and will be undertaken elsewhere .    in conclusion ,",
    "an alternative of leptogenesis through decays of a left - handed sneutrino at a low energy scale has been proposed .",
    "this scenario may be realized in supersymmetric models with non - zero majorana masses of neutrino superfield that lead to mixing and mass splitting between the left - handed sneutrino and the corresponding antisneutrino .",
    "soft supersymmrty breaking sectors provide new sources of cp violation in sneutrino - antisneutrino mixing which can generate a lepton asymmetry in decays of the left - handed sneutrino .",
    "we have shown that the three sakharov conditions  @xcite for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be fulfilled in this restrictive framework .",
