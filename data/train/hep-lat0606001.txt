    "since the earliest studies of quantum field theories on a lattice , it was recognized that quantities measured through numerical simulation are characterized by significant renormalization effects , which must be properly taken into account before meaningful comparisons to corresponding physical observables can be made .",
    "as has been rigorously demonstrated  @xcite , the renormalization procedure can be formally carried out in a systematic way to any given order in perturbation theory .",
    "however , calculations are notoriously difficult , as compared to continuum regularization schemes ; furthermore , the convergence rate of the resulting asymptotic series is often unsatisfactory .    a number of approaches have been pursued in order to improve the behaviour of perturbation theory , among them refs .",
    "these approaches share in common the aim to reorganize perturbative series in terms of an expansion coefficient which would be more suitable than the bare coupling constant @xmath2 ; the definition of such a `` renormalized '' coupling constant is not unique , but can depend on the observables under study and on an energy scale .",
    "it is expected that such a definition will reabsorb a large part of the tadpole contibutions which are known to dominate lattice perturbation theory .",
    "some years ago , a method was proposed to sum up a whole subclass of tadpole diagrams , dubbed `` cactus '' diagrams , to all orders in perturbation theory  @xcite ; this procedure has a number of desirable features : it is gauge invariant , it can be systematically applied to improve ( to all orders ) results obtained at any given order in perturbation theory , and it does indeed absorb the bulk of tadpole contributions into an intricate redefinition of the coupling constant ; in cases where non - perturbative estimates of renormalization coefficients are also available for comparison , the agreement with cactus improved perturbative results is significantly better as compared to results from bare perturbation theory .    in the present work we extend the improved perturbation theory method of refs .",
    "@xcite , to encompass the large class of actions which are used nowadays in simulations of qcd .",
    "this class includes symanzik improved gluon actions with any arbitrary combination of closed wilson loops , combined with any fermionic action . in section ii we present our calculation , deriving expressions for a dressed gluon propagator , as well as for dressed gluon and fermion vertices , as a result of the summation of cactus diagrams to all orders .",
    "we show how these dressed constituents are employed to improve 1-loop and 2-loop feynman diagrams coming from bare perturbation theory . in section iii",
    "we apply our improved renormalizaton procedure to a number of test cases involving symanzik gluons and wilson / clover / overlap fermions .",
    "improvement of qed is relegated to an appendix .",
    "clearly , all resummation procedures , whether in the continuum or on the lattice , bear a caveat : a one - sided resummation could ruin desirable partial cancellations which might exist among those diagrams which are resummed and others which are not ; what is worse , the end result might depend on the gauge .",
    "as we shall see , no partial cancellations will be ruined in our procedure , due to the distinct @xmath3-dependence of the resummed diagrams ( @xmath3 is the number of colors ) ; furthermore , our results will be gauge independent .",
    "in this section , following the outline of ref .",
    "@xcite , we start illustrating our method by showing how the gluon propagator is dressed by the inclusion of cactus diagrams . we will then dress gluon and fermion vertices as well .",
    "finally , we will explain how this procedure is applied to feynman diagrams at a given order in bare perturbation theory , concentrating on the 1- and 2-loop case .",
    "we consider , for the sake of definiteness , the symanzik improved gluon action involving wilson loops with up to 6 links ; it will be evident from what follows that the method is applicable to any gluon action made of wilson loops . in standard notation",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the action reads :    @xmath4\\ , \\label{gluonaction }         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the coefficients @xmath5 can in principle be chosen arbitrarily , subject to a normalization condition which ensures the correct classical continuum limit of the action : @xmath6 some popular choices of values for @xmath5 used in numerical simulations will be considered in the applications of section iii",
    ". the quantities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 respectively : plaquette , rectangle , chair , parallelogram ) in eq .",
    "( [ gluonaction ] ) are products of link variables @xmath9 around the perimeter of the closed loop .    applying the usual parameterization of links in terms of the continuum gauge fields @xmath10 @xmath11 ( @xmath12 : lattice spacing , set to one from now on ; @xmath13 : unit vector in direction @xmath14 ; @xmath15 : generator of @xmath16 algebra ) and the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula , @xmath7 takes the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is simply the sum of the gauge fields on the links of loop @xmath19 ( e.g. , for the plaquette : @xmath20 ) , while @xmath21 are @xmath22-th degree polynomials in the gauge fields , constructed from nested commutators .",
    "we may now _ define _ the cactus diagrams which dress the gluon propagator : these are tadpole diagrams which become disconnected if any one of their vertices is removed ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; further , each vertex is constructed solely from the @xmath18 parts of the action .",
    "a diagrammatic equation for the dressed gluon propagator ( thick line ) in terms of the bare propagator ( thin line ) and 1-particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertices ( solid circle ) reads :    0.05    @xmath23 the 1pi vertex obeys the following recursive equation : @xmath24 in order to put this equation into a mathematical form and solve it , let us first write down the bare inverse propagator @xmath25 resulting from the action  ( [ gluonaction ] ) , and from the gauge fixing term : @xmath26 the quadratic part of the total gluon action thus becomes ( in the notation of ref .",

    "consequently , each of the diagrams on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ recursive ] ) , being the result of a contraction with only two powers of @xmath18 left uncontracted , will necessarily be equal to a linear combination of @xmath33 ; this implies that the 1pi vertex @xmath36 ( the l.h.s .",
    "( [ recursive ] ) ) can be written as : @xmath37 each of the quantities @xmath38 will in general depend on @xmath39 , but not on the momentum .",
    "we must now turn eq .",
    "( [ recursive ] ) into a set of 4 recursive equations for @xmath38 .",
    "( [ propdress ] ) leads to the following expression for the dressed propagator @xmath40 : @xmath41    we observe that dressing affects entirely the transverse part of the inverse propagator , replacing the bare coefficients @xmath5 with improved ones @xmath42 , and leaves the longitudinal part intact .",
    "the same property carries over directly to the propagator itself ; the consequence of this will be that our method leads to the _ same results in all covariant gauges_.    in terms of the dressed propagator , eq .",
    "( [ recursive ] ) can be _ drawn _ as : @xmath43 let us now evaluate a typical diagram on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ recursive2 ] ) ; it will be the sum of 4 terms , one term for each of the wilson loops @xmath44 in the action , from which its @xmath45-point vertex may have originated .",
    "there are @xmath46 1-loop integrals in the diagram ; each of them corresponds to the contraction of two powers of @xmath18 via a dressed propagator , and will contribute one power of @xmath47 , where : @xmath48 ( @xmath49 assume distinct values ; no summation implied ) .",
    "once again , we note that @xmath50 are gauge independent , since the longitudinal part cancels in the loop contraction .    for the contraction of the @xmath16 generators we first evaluate @xmath51 , which is the sum over all complete pairwise contractions of @xmath52 : @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ;",

    "@xcite , using gaussian integration over the space of traceless hermitian matrices  @xcite , with the result : @xmath58 ( @xmath59 : laguerre polynomials ) .",
    "since 2 out of @xmath45 generators remain uncontracted in our case , color contraction does not lead to @xmath51 , but rather to : @xmath60 thus , upon contraction , an @xmath45-leg diagram in eq .",
    "( [ recursive2 ] ) , with its vertex coming from the term @xmath7 of the langrangian ( @xmath61 ) , will merely result in the following multiple of @xmath62 : @xmath63    we are finally in a position to set eq .",

    "we recall that @xmath62 are functions of the external momentum @xmath65 ; if these are independent is not independent of the rest , so that we have 3 equations for 3 coefficients ; this causes no complication . in any case , typically @xmath66 in simulations . ] , then eq .",
    "( [ recursive3 ] ) amounts to 4 equations for the 4 coefficients @xmath38 .",
    "the generalization of our procedure for improved gluon actions with arbitrary numbers and types of wilson loops is now evident .",
    "it is crucial to check at this stage that all combinatorial weights are correctly incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ recursive3 ] ) ; this is indeed the case .",
    "splitting eq .",
    "( [ recursive3 ] ) into 4 separate equations , and making use of eq .",

    "( [ rescaled ] ) , it is not _ a priori _ clear that a solution for @xmath76 always exists which lead to a given set of dressed values @xmath76 is immediate , since the integrals @xmath81 only depend on @xmath76 , not @xmath82 . ]",
    "; it turns out that this is always the case , for all physically interesting values of @xmath5 , and for all values of @xmath2 ranging from @xmath83 up to a certain limit value , well inside the strong coupling region .    fortunately , numerical solutions of eqs .",
