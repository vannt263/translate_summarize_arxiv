    "<S> sometimes , such an interaction may need to be switched off adiabatically in order to isolate the quantum information encoded in the edge states @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we look at mbqc on two - body interacting spin-1/2 particles subject to adiabatic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> two - body spin-1/2 interactions are generally preferred as such systems , compared to systems with higher spins and many - body interactions , are generally better suited for experimental implementation @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this naturally leads to the need for the system to be cooled to a sufficiently low temperature depending on the size of the energy gap . here </S>",
    "<S> , we create cluster states by adiabatically evolving the ground state of two - body interacting spin-1/2 particles with a built - in energy gap protection . </S>",

    "<S> we need a target hamiltonian whose unique ground state is the cluster state . while a cluster state is never a unique ground state of any two - body interaction hamiltonian , it can still be one of the degenerate ground states . by slowly weakening the interactions of a two - body hamiltonian , we show that the system could eventually achieve a cluster state as one of the degenerate ground states . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be emphasized that even though our proposal can yield a cluster state of logical qubits as the target state , the energy gap disappears at the end of the adiabatic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , thanks to the inherent symmetry of stabilizers , the desired ground state is protected from the noise due to the finite speed of evolution even if the energy gap vanishes . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> our proposal differs from the standard aqc schemes .    in our models , we regard each qubit of the cluster state as a logical qubit of several spin-1/2 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum correlations , i.e. , _ stabilizers _ , of the cluster state are established in the initial state , which is the ground state protected by a large energy gap and therefore tolerates a relatively higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state can not be used for the mbqc , since it is outside the logical subspace where logical qubits are encoded . </S>",
    "<S> these cluster - state correlations are preserved during the adiabatic evolution . in this way , </S>",
