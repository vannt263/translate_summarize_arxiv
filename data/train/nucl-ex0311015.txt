    "supersymmetry has been successfully transferred from particle physics to nuclear physics by franco iachello and coworkers@xcite .",
    "various attempts to obtain an extended classification , in which several neighboring nuclei including even , odd and odd ",
    "odd ones are described by the same hamiltonian , have led to convincing results e.g.@xcite . however , in nuclear structure theory primary attention has been paid to the investigation of models with hamiltonians which exhibit dynamical supersymmetries . in a recent paper@xcite",
    "it has been shown , however , that the concepts of identical bands@xcite and pseudo - spin @xcite allows one to discuss ( partial ) supersymmetry also for cases in which the even partner nucleus has no dynamical symmetry .",
    "this has also been discussed in the consistent q formalism@xcite .",
    "the concept of `` identical bands '' ( ib ) was suggested by a strasbourgh - liverpool collaboration led by byrski @xcite , who found an agreement to better than 0.3% in the gamma energies of two superdeformed ( sd ) bands in @xmath3 tb and@xmath4dy .",
    "the role of pseudo - spin in identical bands was subsequently clarified by nazarewicz et al .",
    "an explanation based on the u(6/12 ) supersymmetry was given in the frame of the interacting boson model by gelberg et al .",
    "@xcite and in the frame of supersymmetric quantum mechanics by amado , bijker et al .",
    "although the importance of the discovery of the ib was widely recognized the data on the dy - tb pair are still incomplete due to experimental difficulties .",
    "the group at argonne has recently settled the spins of the identical superdeformed band in @xmath4dy @xcite but the spins in @xmath3 tb are still unknown . also the 3/2 , 7/2 ... signature partner band in @xmath3 tb is still missing .",
    "this shows that one has to rely on the spectroscopy of `` identical bands '' at normal deformation , where spins and parities are all known . in this case",
    "the moments of inertia of the even and odd nucleus system tend to differ by 10% or more as compared to 0.3% in the sd case .",
    "a survey is given by baktash et al.@xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 a convincing example of the identical bands in @xmath5hf and @xmath6hf @xcite .    fig.1    comparison of the energies of susy partner bands in @xmath5hf and@xmath6hf .",
    "the energies labeled calc are obtained by correcting for the change in the moment of inertia and by allowing a pseudo - spin orbit coupling . from jolos",
    "et al.@xcite .",
    "in the following i will review the koeln - dubna work@xcite which focused on the supersymmetry connected with identical bands . in order to avoid equations or technical discussions a simple schematic model for supersymmetry",
    "will be discussed .",
    "this is done on the basis of the u(6/12 ) supersymmetry @xcitewhich has a very transparent microscopic foundation . in u(6/12 ) respectively in u(15/30)@xcite there are three ( five ) contributing shells in the odd nucleus and which have the spins 1/2 , 3/2 and 5/2 ( or 1/2 , 3/2 , 5/2 , 7/2 and 9/2 )",
    "in discussing the u(6/12 ) susy and the schematic model pseudo - spin plays an important role .",
    "thus i make a few comments on pseudo - spin symmetry .",
    "this approximate symmetry is long known @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown , that pseudo - spin symmetry is actually based on a relativistic symmetry@xcite .",
    "we remind briefly the pseudo - spin scheme : in fig .",
    "2 the s.p .",
    "neutron states around @xmath7pb are shown . in the pseudo - spin scheme the 3p1/2 , 2f5/2 and 3p3/2 levels",
    "are relabeled with the pseudo - spin quantum numbers 2 @xmath8 1/2 * , * 2 @xmath9 5/2 , 2 @xmath9 3/2 .",
    "whereas the angular momenta of the particle are l = 1 or l = 3 respectively , the pseudo angular momenta are @xmath10 or @xmath11 . for simplicity it is assumed in the following that the pseudo - spin of the last odd particle is fully decoupled in energy . in this case to each state with spin @xmath12 of the even nucleus there belongs a multiplet of states in the odd partner nucleus with the same excitation energy and with spins :    @xmath13    respectively . in particular there is a doublet of states for @xmath14 and a singlet for @xmath15 .",
    "an example of nearly decoupled pseudo - spin multiplets is found in very nice data by jolie and graw@xcite .",
    "they measured a set of states which is presumably complete below 1 mev .",
    "after this they were able to assign the observed levels to pseudo - spin multiplets . indeed - as shown in fig .",
    "3 - each level in @xmath16pt ( below 0.8 mev ) comes either as a doublet or as a singlet if @xmath17 @xmath17@xmath12 = 1/2 .",
    "this is to -my knowledge -    fig .",
    "2    the figure shows on the right side the spins of the neutron single particle energies in pb and on the left side their pseudo angular momentum : @xmath18 .    the only case in which pseudo - spin multiplets in the odd nucleus are seen so clearly .",
    "so more data are needed .",
    "it is a beautiful prediction from the dynamical u(6/12 ) supersymmetry and from the pseudo - spin concept .",
    "i will now discuss a schematic model for supersymmetry ( susy ) with identical bands in the frame of u(6/12 ) .",
    "the odd particle is in shells with spins 1/2 , 3/2 and 5/2 only .",
    "the pseudo angular momenta @xmath18 of the odd particle have integer values and can be considered as bosonic excitations .",
    "they have the values @xmath18 = 0 and @xmath18 = 2 corresponding to the spins l = 0 and l = 2 of the s and d bosons .",
    "thus it is `` natural '' following t. otsuka @xcite to describe the particles with pseudo angular momenta @xmath18 = 0 and @xmath18 = 2 by ( pseudo angular momentum ) quasi bosons with the spins @xmath18 = 0 : @xmath19 and @xmath18=2 : @xmath20 .",
    "thus there are three kinds of bosons : neutron bosons @xmath21 , proton bosons @xmath22 , and quasi bosons @xmath23    the schematic model assumes :    * equal energies @xmath24 of the three kinds of bosons : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 * equal interactions @xmath25 among the three kinds of bosons @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "* fully decoupled pseudo - spin .",
    "these assumptions imply identical bands in the following three bosonic systems : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined in fig . 3 and which have the same total boson numbers@xmath29 @xmath30 : but with different numbers of bosons of the three kinds : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "3    the figure illustrates the `` identical bands '' suggested by the schematic model in four `` nuclei '' which have the same total number of `` bosons '' but differing numbers of bosons of various types as shown in the figure .",
    "the `` nucleus '' @xmath31 is obtained from @xmath28 by adding the pseudo - spin @xmath8    in particular one finds :    * to every state in @xmath26 there corresponds a state in @xmath27 with the same energy . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are members of an f spin multiplet .",
    "they have good f - spin .",
    "* to every state in @xmath27 there corresponds a state in @xmath28 with the same energy and vice versa * to every state in @xmath28 there corresponds a pseudo - spin multiplet in @xmath31 with the same energy    in summary in the schematic model to each pseudo - spin multiplet of the odd system there belongs a unique state of the corresponding even system with the same energy .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result .",
    "it means that there are as many states in the even `` nucleus '' @xmath27 as there are pseudo - spin multiplets in the `` odd nucleus '' @xmath31 .",
    "one might think that the odd nucleus has many more states .",
    "one must remember , however , that also the `` mixed symmetry '' states in the `` even nucleus '' have to be considered .",
    "below the following predictions a ) ... d ) of the schematic model are compared to data :    * \\a ) to each level below about 0.8 mev in @xmath32pt there is a multiplet in @xmath16pt with similar energy .",
    "we note that not only the yrast band but e.g. also the gamma band has a susy partner .",
    "( see fig .",
    "4 @xcite ) we note that the energies of the centroids of the doublets differ somewhat from the energy of the corresponding level in @xmath32pt .",
    "also there is some splitting in the doublets .",
    "thus the schematic model is broken somewhat * \\b ) there are low lying multiplets in @xmath16pt which do not correspond to low lying states in@xmath32pt , however . in the schematic model they might correspond to high lying mixed symmetry states @xcite .",
    "an example is the ( 199 kev and 224 kev ) doublet , which has a core state with i@xmath33 = 1@xmath34 .",
    "4    shown are the spins , experimental(right ) and susy ( left ) energies of @xmath32pt and @xmath16pt .",
    "each level below about 0.8 mev in @xmath16pt is a nearly decoupled pseudo - spin doublet or if @xmath35 a singlet .",
    "the ib are the states in @xmath32pt and the states in @xmath16pt with label @xmath36 $ ] below . from metz et al.@xcite    * \\c ) in the rare earth region there are identical bands with a vanishing projection @xmath37 of the pseudo angular momentum on the symmetry axis .",
    "the @xmath38 band qualifies as super symmetrical partner band of the k = 0 ground band of the even partner nucleus .",
    "these were the bands considered in @xcite .",
    "examples are identical bands in@xmath0yb ( fig .",
    "5 ) , @xmath1hf ( fig . 1 ) and in @xmath39pt @xcite .",
    "these are convincing susy partner bands . *",
    "d ) the bands in @xmath0yb , in @xmath1hf and in @xmath40pt which have a non vanishing pseudo angular projection @xmath41 have a pseudo - spin partner band which is separated in energy by a few hundred kev or more .",
    "thus pseudo - spin is not decoupled for these bands . and the schematic model breaks down for these bands .",
    "we note that a ) and c ) show that there are identical bands and spectra .",
    "b ) indicates that there are levels in these nuclei which have no partners with the same energies .",
    "thus the schematic susy survives only for a part of the levels as a partial symmetry@xcite .",
    "we note , however , that these extra states are reproduced in the dynamical u(6/12 ) susy as this uses a different ( more correct ) interaction .",
    "part of the reason for the failure is certainly that pseudo - spin is not fully decoupled i.e. the excitation energies in the pseudo - spin doublets are not equal . in @xmath42pb one",
    "finds : @xmath43 ( 2f5/2 - 3p3/2 ) = 329kev .",
    "however the pseudo - spin splitting is still much smaller than the spin orbit splitting : @xmath43 ( 2f5/2 - 3p3/2 ) @xmath44 0.36 * @xmath43 ( 3p1/2 -3 p3/2 ) ) .",
    "an interesting point concerns the apparent validity of pseudo - spin in the @xmath38 bands in @xmath0yb , @xmath1hf and @xmath45pt ( see c ) and the fact that pseudo - spin is not decoupled for the @xmath46 .the reason may be that the @xmath38 state has no pseudo - spin partner , as is shown e.g. in fig . 2 for the 3 p 1/2 state , whereas for @xmath46 there are two pseudo - spin partner levels e.g. the 2f5/2 and 3p3/2 levels , which can interact .",
    "the small decoupling in the @xmath38 bands is also interesting and deserves a closer study .",
    "there are 5 requirements for an k = 0 and an odd rotational band in neighbor nuclei to be super partners of an unbroken partial supersymmetry :                  at this point it might be appropriate to avoid a possible misunderstanding , namely that the @xmath48 , @xmath49=0 bands e.g , in @xmath50yb could be obtained by a weak coupling of the spin of the core state i of @xmath51yb to the pseudo - spin.@xmath52    this is not true at all .",
    "rather one couples the spins i of several core states strongly to the pseudo angular momentum @xmath18 of the particle and after this the pseudo - spin is weakly coupled.@xmath53\\;\\ ] ]    thus neither @xmath54 nor @xmath18 are not even approximately good quantum numbers . and",
    "although the @xmath0yb pair looks like a weak coupling situation , it is actually a quite complicated coupling scheme : strong for @xmath18 and weak for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the figure compares k= 1/2 bands in @xmath50yb and @xmath50tm with the k = 0 ground band in @xmath51yb .the bands in yb have @xmath38 and thus form a susy doublet .",
    "the band in @xmath50tm has @xmath55 ( doublet for groundstate ) and is thus not the susy partner of @xmath51yb , which has @xmath38 . from klug et al.@xcite    for both susy partners .",
    "the energies are shown in fig .",
    "5 agree with the susy . for these reasons",
    "klug , dewald et al . measured precision lifetimes by the recoil distance method following coulomb excitation experiments using an euroball cluster detector at the fn - tandem accelerator in koeln @xcite . from these data and previous data on branching and mixing ratios from canberra ,",
    "the ratios of the transition quadrupole moments for corresponding e2 transitions in @xmath50yb and @xmath51yb were obtained , which are given in the table 1 .      ratios of transition quadrupole moments @xmath56 from susy partner bands in @xmath50yb and@xmath51yb .",
    "the @xmath56 values are obtained from the measured b(e2 ) values by using the formulas for the quadrupole moments for the rigid rotor . from klug",
    ", dewald et al.@xcite       one notes that the values of the transition quadrupole moment @xmath56 for @xmath50yb and @xmath51yb are in equal within an error of a few percent@xcite .",
    "this is one of the most accurate experimental comparisons of transition quadrupole moments for supersymmetry partner bands .",
    "this striking agreement supports strongly the proposed supersymmetry for @xmath50yb and @xmath51yb .",
    "indeed all 5 of the requirements for a supersymmetry are fulfilled for the@xmath50yb and @xmath51yb pair . on the contrary in the @xmath50tm and @xmath51yb pair only three conditions",
    "are fulfilled , whereas the conditions 3 ) and 5 ) : an even pseudo angular momentum of the particle are violated . and indeed there is no supersymmetry in this case .",
    "summing up convincing examples of ( partial ) susy for energies and b(e2 ) values in identical bands are shown .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the u(6/12 ) susy in the frame of the pseudo - spin concept and the schematic model have been given .",
    "limitations of supersymmetry and pseudo - spin symmetry restricting the susy to a partial susy have been discussed .",
    "my particular thanks go to franco iachello , for his constant inspiration to koeln work since many years .",
    "thanks go also to a. dewald , a. gelberg , j. jolie , r. v. jolos and t. otsuka for joint works published and in progress on supersymmetry which were used in this talk .",
