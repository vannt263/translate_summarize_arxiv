    "there has been a lot of interest recently in ` nonassociative geometry ' as a further extension of the ideas of noncommutative geometry , with now the ` coordinate algebra ' allowed to be nonassociative . the framework which we use of quasialgebras",
    "was already established and used to describe the octonions as quasispaces some years ago @xcite . these were , moreover , constructed as a ` cochain twist ' of a classical associative space .",
    "differential geometry on such quasispaces was introduced in @xcite and in this paper we add gauge theory.    the need for nonassociative geometry for noncommutative differential forms ( even when the coordinate algebra itself remains associative ) was shown in @xcite , where it was proven that all differential form algebras on the standard q - deformation quantum groups , if they are to be bicovariant and to have classical dimensions , must indeed be nonassociative . thus the usual assumption in noncommutative geometry , including in @xcite , that differential forms should be associative , appears to be too strong . from a physics point of view",
    "also , there are suggestions that the world volume algebras on certain string theories are naturally nonassociative , and this has been realised quite concretely in some form in the context of reduced matrix models , see @xcite . in the latter is posed the problem of gauge theory on such spaces , with apparently higher order differentials being required .",
    "we start by making precise what is fairly clear that the simplified ` fuzzy ' algebras in @xcite are indeed quasialgebras in our required sense .",
    "we then show that in this case there is a natural formulation of gauge theory on them looking much more like the classical case .",
    "we describe this theory for any quasialgebra ( or algebra in a nonassociative monoidal category ) at an algebraic level and give a general construction for examples equivalent to @xmath1-yang - mills in the associative case .",
    "the framework allows for nonabelian gauge theory as well .",
    "also , we do not discuss lagrangians here but all of the necessary data and methods for these are known in the associative case , see notably @xcite , and apply equivalently to quasialgebras obtained by cochain twists .    as well as covering the string - motivated example",
    ", we explore fully the octonions as finite quasi - geometries par excellence .",
    "we show that the cochain @xmath3 in @xcite that modifies the group algebra of the cube @xmath2 to the octonion product has the very remarkable feature of being invariant under @xmath2-fourier transform . using this",
    ", we also find an explicit more geometrical @xmath4-product description of the octonion as a nonassociative quantisation of the coordinate algebra on the fourier - dual cube @xmath2 by means if a ( finite difference ) bidifferential operator .",
    "this is in the spirit of the moyal - product of functions on @xmath5 , but now nonassociative .",
    "the associative quantisation ( clifford algebra ) case is also covered .",
    "the paper begins in section 2 with a brief introduction the theory of quasialgebras obtained by cochain twist@xcite , as algebras in a ( symmetric ) monoidal category .",
    "sections  2.1 and  2.2 respectively outline the continuous case deforming @xmath5 and the finite case deforming group algebras . in secton 3.1",
    "we recall from @xcite the formulation of gauge theory in such a general monoidal category and the diagrammatic notation for it . section  3.2 appiles this at an algebraic level to describe gauge theory on cochain twist quasi - algebras in general .",
    "section  3.3 gives a canonical general example where the gauge group can be chosen canonically .",
    "although appearing nonabelian ( and nonassociative ) we show that this particular choice gives a theory equivalent to the undeformed @xmath1-yang - mills theory , note that in noncommutative geometry even the @xmath1 theory has @xmath6 and we use the phrase yang - mills to distinguish this nonlinear theory from the maxwell case where @xmath7 .",
    "in section 4 we apply the theory the quasialgebra versions of @xmath5 of interest in @xcite under heading of a simplified ` fuzzy @xmath5 ' .",
    "section  4.1 introduces the required nonassociative differential calculus and section  4.2 the promised gauge theory .",
    "finally , in section  5 we apply the theory the octonions .",
    "section  5.1 warms up with the new results about the octonions as @xmath4-product .",
    "section  5.2 has the gauge theory worked out for the octonions .",
    "in fact the example of deformed nonassociative gauge theory that we finally arrive at here takes the remarkably workable form @xmath8 @xmath9 where the sum is over the different graded fourier components of each object and to this end @xmath10 denotes a second independent copy of @xmath11 .",
    "such a description also works for the fuzzy-@xmath0 if one works in terms of plane waves and their differentials ; this is already the case for the octonions where the generators have in our picture the interpretation of deformed plane waves on the cube . in the octonions case @xmath3 has values @xmath12 but is not simply an exponential bilinear of the vector degrees ( the 3-momentum ) as its exponent has cubic terms .",
    "it is not known if such quasi - geometry of the octonions has a direct physical role , but see for example @xcite .",
    "we also note the link between the octonions and particle physics@xcite ; their geometry might play a role in the context of the direct product of spacetime by the finite geometry .",
    "section  5.3 fills a gap in the literature , namely a complete description of the moduli space of flat @xmath1-yang - mills fields up to gauge transformation on @xmath13 and @xmath2 , using the same methods as for the symmetric group @xmath14 in @xcite .",
    "the above equivalence means that the @xmath2 case also classifies flat connections in the nonassociative theory on the octonions .",
    "we note that flat connections on finite groups are also of interest in pure mathematics in connection with schubert calculus on flag varieties @xcite .",
    "going back to physics , the quantum @xmath1-yang - mills theory on @xmath13 is fully worked out in @xcite and is renormalisable and computable .",
    "the @xmath2 and octonion cases could in principle be similarly computed .",
    "thus would be one of several directions for further work .",
    "we also note the related paper @xcite where cochain twists are used to describe associative quantisations in which the differential calculus , however , is nonassociative .",
    "it turns out that several popular associative quantisations in physics fall into this category ; the algebra of coordinates is associative but the nonassociative gauge theory described here still plays a role in view of the differential calculus .",
    "examples in this category include @xmath15 as quantisation of the kirillov - kostant bracket , now expressed as a cochain twist at least to lower order , see @xcite .",
    "the constructions in the paper come out of quantum group theory ( i.e. we use the language of hopf algebras ) but we apply them to classical ( not quantum ) enveloping algebras and finite group algebras .",
    "thus , let @xmath16 be a hopf algebra with coproduct @xmath17 , counit @xmath18 and antipode @xmath19 , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be a cochain , i.e. @xmath21 is invertible and @xmath22",
    ". associated to @xmath21 is its nonabelian cohomology coboundary @xmath23 where @xmath24 , etc . by construction @xmath25 , called the ` associator ' , is a 3-cocycle in the required sense .",
    "these data go back to v.g .",
    "drinfeld and it is known that @xmath26 defined by the same algebra as @xmath16 and with coproduct @xmath27 and suitable @xmath28 gives a quasi - hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "now let @xmath29 be an @xmath16-covariant associative algebra .",
    "the cochain - twisted quasialgebra @xmath30 is defined as the same vector space as @xmath29 but with a new product @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the action of each copy of @xmath16 .",
    "the new @xmath30 is nonassociative but obeys @xmath33 for all @xmath34 , and is covariant under @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath35 is an algebra of differential forms on @xmath29 that is @xmath16-covariant , then @xmath36 defines for us the wedge product algebra of differential forms on @xmath30 , covariant under @xmath26 and again potentially non - associative@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath37 is not deformed and assumed to be commute with the action of @xmath16 , hence @xmath38 for the deformed wedge product in terms of the undeformed one , where @xmath39 ( summation understood ) is a notation .",
    "the two examples that will be fully computed in the paper are of the general types which we now describe .",
    "note that we work over @xmath40 for convenience and because in physical examples there are further unitarity restrictions ( otherwise , the general constructions work over any field , though one should avoid certain characteristics in the examples ) . also , we use the @xmath16-module version of the cochain twist theory as above because actions are more familiar to physicists ; there is a parallel and in many ways better version of the theory with @xmath16 coacting on the algebra .",
    "let @xmath41 , with hopf algebra structure @xmath42 here @xmath5 acts on @xmath5 by translation and hence on its coordinate algebra @xmath43 $ ] by differentiation operators @xmath44 and we think of the latter quite concretely as generating @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a nowhere vanishing function of two vector coordinates ( i.e. a function on @xmath46 ) with value 1 when either argument is zero .",
    "we consider @xmath20 ( or in some completion of this space if @xmath21 is not a polynomial ) as a cochain . because @xmath16 is commutative , @xmath47 as an algebra and as a coalgebra , but is still regarded with @xmath48 as a quasi - hopf algebra . here",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 in @xmath52 so @xmath25 is a function of these @xmath53 variables .",
    "then @xmath30 has a new product @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 are acted upon by @xmath57 respectively and then the result multiplied .",
    "quasi - associativity will take the form above , as @xmath58 where @xmath59 means @xmath60 acting on @xmath61 , @xmath62 means @xmath60 acting on @xmath63 , @xmath64 means @xmath60 acting on @xmath65 , and products are in @xmath30 .",
    "recall that @xmath60 itself is a vector , namely the momentum vector operator generating translations in @xmath5 .    of interest in physics seems to be the following special case .",
    "let @xmath66 taken with the euclidean metric say ( or any other fixed tensor @xmath67 on @xmath5 in place of the dot product ) .",
    "let @xmath68 be any nowhere vanishing function in _",
    "one _ variable and take @xmath69 where @xmath70 is @xmath71 embedded in the first and third tensor positions , etc .",
    "if @xmath68 is an exponential then @xmath72 and @xmath30 is associative .",
    "for example , of @xmath73 is antisymmetric one has the usual moyal product for the heisenberg - weyl algebra or so - called noncommutative @xmath5 used for example by seiberg and witten for the effective description of the ends of open strings on 2-branes . at the other extreme",
    "would be @xmath73 the euclidean metric in which case the algebra remains commutative and associative .",
    "in general if @xmath21 remains symmetric but @xmath68 is no longer an exponential then the algebra @xmath30 will be commutative but not associative .",
    "this covers the example in @xcite where @xmath74 which becomes approximately an exponential @xmath75 as @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 is the deformation parameter which is taken with value @xmath78 in @xcite , but one can also keep these parameters @xmath79 independent .",
    "we have @xmath80    another interesting family of commutative but nonassociative quasi-@xmath5 is with @xmath81 when we unpack our compact notation ( summation convention understood ) .",
    "a third variant is with @xmath82 where an extra dilation generator @xmath83 is added .",
    "its relations , coproduct and action on coordinates are @xmath84=-{\\partial}^i,\\quad \\delta d = d{\\mathop{\\otimes}}1 + 1{\\mathop{\\otimes}}d,\\quad d{{\\triangleright}}x_i = x_i\\ ] ] ( so that @xmath83 has action @xmath85 on a monomial of total degree @xmath85 ) . in this way",
    "@xmath43 $ ] is again covariant under this extended @xmath16 .",
    "one can now have more interesting cochains , for example @xmath86 for a ` potential function ' @xmath87 . if @xmath88 we have @xmath72 as explained above .",
    "in general is tempting to think of the introduction of non - bilinears in the exponent of @xmath21 as a way to encode interactions as non - associativity .",
    "the passage from the free theory to the interacting theory would then be a matter of a cochain twist by the interaction@xcite .",
    "this last example is in that spirit .",
    "clearly a great many models along the above lines are equally possible , as any cochain @xmath21 is allowed in our framework .      here",
    "we take @xmath90 , the functions on a finite group .",
    "this has basis of delta - functions @xmath91 labelled by @xmath92 and coproduct @xmath93 , counit @xmath94 and antipode @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath96 is the group identity .",
    "we take @xmath97 the group algebra of @xmath98 .",
    "this has basis @xmath99 labelled again by group elements .",
    "the product is just the product of @xmath98 , so @xmath100 .",
    "this is covariant under @xmath101 with action @xmath102    a cochain on @xmath16 is a suitable @xmath20 i.e. a nowhere vanishing 2-argument function @xmath103 on the group with value @xmath104 when either argument is the group identity @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath105 is the usual group - cohomology coboundary of @xmath21 and is a group 3-cocycle .",
    "then @xmath26 is the same algebra and coalgebra as @xmath16 but is viewed as a quasi - hopf algebra with this @xmath25 . finally , the canonical example of a quasi - algebra here is the twisted group algebra @xmath30 with the new product @xmath106    an example is @xmath107 which we write additively as @xmath108-vectors @xmath109 with entries in @xmath110 .",
    "we take @xmath111 the new product @xmath112 is that of the octonions @xmath113 as explained in @xcite .",
    "if we think of this in the same spirit as the models above , we note that @xmath25 comes from the cubic ` interaction term ' in the exponent of @xmath21 .",
    "thus the octonions are a cochain quantisation of the finite group @xmath2 as a quasi - algebra . without the cubic interaction term one has the clifford algebra in 3 dimensions .",
    "similarly @xmath114 gives the quaternions or ( over @xmath40 ) the algebra of @xmath115 matrices .",
    "one can do the same for larger @xmath89 . for the same bilinear form as the above one , one obtains the clifford algebra as an associative cochain quantisation of @xmath89 , while further ` interaction ' terms give higher cayley - dickson and other quasi - algebras of interest , see @xcite .",
    "many other examples could be of interest , eg for @xmath116 see @xcite .",
    "with the above background the main question we address in this paper is that of gauge theory on nonassociative spaces . for the ones in section 2.1 of interest in string theory ,",
    "a somewhat complex approach has been proposed in @xcite whereas here we propose a simpler one .",
    "briefly , geometry including gauge theory can be done in any monoidal abelian category @xmath117@xcite@xcite .",
    "we explain this in section  3.1 and give a concrete algebraic setting in sections 3.2 and  3.3 , which are the new results of the section .    before doing this ,",
    "let us explain the problem at the simplest level .",
    "if we have an associative algebra with a differential calculus obeying the leibniz rule , one can write down the simplest @xmath1-yang - mills theory where a connection is a differential 1-form @xmath118 , decreed to transform as @xmath119 for @xmath120 any invertible element of the algebra .",
    "the fundamental lemma of gauge theory is that then the curvature @xmath6 transforms by conjugation to @xmath121 .",
    "note that the non - linear term need not vanish in noncommutative geometry even in this simplest case .",
    "the moduli space of flat connections up to gauge transformations is highly nontrivial even for the simplest commutative or noncommutative algebras @xcite and carries a lot of ` homotopy ' information .",
    "we will describe it for the functions on the cube @xmath2 in section 5.3 under a further unitarity restriction ( in the @xmath122-algebra case one requires @xmath123 i.e. unitary . )",
    "let us try this now when the algebra is nonassociative .",
    "the simplest part of the above lemma is that @xmath124 should have zero curvature .",
    "being careful about brackets , we have @xmath125 which is nonzero precisely when @xmath126 fail to associate .",
    "the computation of @xmath127 here is from @xmath128 and the leibniz rule , being careful about brackets .",
    "this could work for some @xmath120 in the algebra but not for all invertible or unitary elements as in the associative case .",
    "a monoidal category @xmath117 means a collection of objects with a tensor product between any two objects and an associator natural isomorphism @xmath129 for any three objects , obeying the usual properties , notably mac lane s pentagon identity .",
    "the latter says that the two routes to rebracket @xmath130 are the same . in that case",
    "the coherence theorem of mac lane says that all other bracketting ambiguities are resolved , i.e. we can and should freely insert associators @xmath25 in order for expressions to make sense and different ways to do that will give the same result .",
    "in that case we can adopt a diagrammatic notation in which we omit brackets entirely .",
    "we also denote @xmath131 by omission .",
    "we write maps between objects ( morphisms ) as beads on a string flowing down from one object to the other .",
    "we also require direct sums @xmath132 to be defined and to be compatible in the usual way with @xmath131 .",
    "now , because brackets are omitted , gauge theory _ must _ work at this level because usual associative gauge theory works when expressed by the same diagrams . in the nonassociative case",
    ", however , the translation of the diagrams back into algebra requires the insertion of the nontrivial associator @xmath25 for rebrackettings .",
    "we recall here only the basic level of gauge theory@xcite in this diagrammatic form ; there is a more geometrical theory with diagrammatic principal bundles etc.@xcite .",
    "as an example an associative algebra @xmath133 in a monoidal category means an object @xmath133 with a product y such that the two ways to feed the result of y into another y give the same . as a result we can depict the iterated product as a node with three lines coming in and one coming out ( i.e. collapse the two equivalent tree graphs ) .",
    "we will use such a notation .",
    "a coalgebra @xmath134 is an object @xmath134 with a coproduct @xmath135 which we denote by an up - side - down y and which ` coassociates ' similarly .",
    "the unit axiom for an algebra says that a 1 branching into a product can be ` pruned ' off .",
    "similarly a counit @xmath136 ( the latter denoted by omission ) is a branch emerging from a coproduct node and can be pruned .",
    "more details of algebra in such diagrams are in @xcite .",
    "a coalgebra @xmath134 can coact on an object @xmath137 and we use the up - side - down y also to denote the coaction @xmath138 .",
    "similarly , a differential calculus @xmath139 on @xmath133 means a graded algebra in the category with @xmath133 in degree zero , and @xmath37 a morphism ( hence a node ) increasing degree by 1 , obeying a graded - leibniz rule and @xmath140 .",
    "all of this translates directly into ( sums of ) diagrams .",
    "one usually assumes that @xmath139 is generated by @xmath133 and the 1-forms @xmath141 but this is not necessary for the basic level of gauge theory that we describe here .",
    "we use y also to denote products in this exterior algebra .",
    "@xmath142    we are now ready to define matter fields as morphisms @xmath143",
    ". one can consider that @xmath144 has ` values in @xmath145 ' ( but it is more convenient to view it is a morphism ) .",
    "similarly , a gauge field is a morphism @xmath146 where @xmath134 is at least a coalgebra .",
    "typically it might be a hopf algebra in the category if this is braided , but such an assumption is again not needed for the basic level of gauge theory .",
    "one may think of @xmath11 as a 1-form with values in the algebra @xmath147 , i.e. we do general possibly non - abelian gauge theory here , but again it is more convenient to view @xmath11 as a morphism .",
    "finally , a gauge transformation is a morphism @xmath148 with inverse @xmath149 in the sense @xmath150 or in diagrams : if we split using the coproduct , apply @xmath151 and close up with a product y , this composition is the same either way as the counit map @xmath152 into nothing , followed by the unit map @xmath104 coming from nothing .",
    "the action of such gauge transformations is shown in figure  1(a ) .",
    "the basic covariant objects of interest namely the curvature and covariant derivative ( the former is in a suitable sense the square of the latter ) are shown in part ( b ) of the figure .",
    "the fundamental lemmas of gauge theory are then shown in parts ( c ) and ( d ) of the figure ; we check that @xmath153 and that @xmath154 . in ( c )",
    ", we expand @xmath37 on the ` conjugated ' @xmath11 using the leibniz rule to obtain the first three terms .",
    "the next term is @xmath37 applied to ` @xmath155 ' again using the leibniz rule , followed by @xmath140 .",
    "the remaining four terms are an expansion of ` @xmath156 ' .",
    "of the various terms , the 2nd and 5th ( after cancelling @xmath157 to obtain a unit and counit and ` pruning ' these as explained above ) give the transform of @xmath158 as required .",
    "the 1st ( after inserting @xmath157 and 7th combine via leibniz to give zero in view of @xmath159 .",
    "the 4th ( inserting @xmath157 ) and 8th likewise give zero for the same reason . in ( d )",
    "we compute @xmath160 using the transformed quantities .",
    "the 2nd and 4th terms cancel ( after cancelling @xmath157 ) and we identify the required result .",
    "this establishes local gauge theory at this diagrammatic level cf .",
    "@xcite ( where the focus was on the universal calculus , not assumed here ) . for principal bundles etc at this level",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the latter contains explicit ( associative ) examples .",
    "the questions arise : how to obtain nonassociative examples of such a diagrammatic gauge theory and how does it look in explicit calculations ?",
    "we will address the first in the remainder of the section , and the second in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we do this by extending the cochain twisting theory in section  2 .",
    "thus let @xmath29 be an algebra with calculus covariant under a background symmetry @xmath16 as in section  2",
    ". here @xmath29 could be functions on a classical manifold and @xmath16 the enveloping algebra of an ordinary lie algebra , for example .",
    "let now @xmath161 be an @xmath16-covariant coalgebra .",
    "it means that there is a coproduct @xmath162 which is an intertwiner for the aciton of @xmath16 .",
    "also a counit @xmath163 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath164 and @xmath160 are as in section  3.1 , i.e. a connection , gauge transformation etc .",
    "these form a gauge theory with the usual tensor product on the associative algebra @xmath29 as in section 3.1 .",
    "this theory can also be written without diagrams by means of the ` convolution product ' @xmath122 of maps from a coalgebra to an algebra or module .",
    "thus @xmath165 and so forth .",
    "if @xmath166 with @xmath167 , we have the simplest case of gauge theory mentioned in the preamble above .",
    "when @xmath168 the functions on a lie group one has a general form of nonabelian gauge theory .",
    "one can take here @xmath16 to be trivial , otherwise one has an equivariant gauge theory .",
    "now let @xmath20 be a cochain and define @xmath169 as a vector space but with deformed coproduct @xmath170 and unchanged @xmath163 .",
    "firstly , it can be seen that @xmath171 is covariant under the twisted @xmath26 . indeed ,",
    "@xmath172 as the quasi - hopf algebra @xmath26 acts on tensor products by its twisted coproduct @xmath173 as explained in section  2 .",
    "moreover , @xmath171 is a coalgebra but only in the monoidal category of @xmath26-modules , i.e. a quasi - coalgebra in the sense : @xmath174 as may be verified by direct computation .",
    "the theory is dual to that of twisting algebras so we omit the details .",
    "similarly if @xmath175 is a coaction covariant under @xmath16 , we define @xmath176 to be the same vector space but with deformed coaction @xmath177 , and can check that is is covariant under @xmath26 and a coaction of @xmath171 in the monoidal category .",
    "we now claim that the same maps viewed as morphisms @xmath178 form a gauge theory in the monoidal category of @xmath26-covariant objects , i.e. are an example of the constructions in section  3.1 and enjoy the same relationships as before twisting . for example , if we compute @xmath179 where the subscript means in the deformed nonassociative theory , @xmath180 because each @xmath11 is an intertwiner i.e. covariant under the action of @xmath16 .",
    "we use @xmath4 for the deformed product in the exterior algebra including wedge products .",
    "similarly for all other expressions .",
    "in other words _ the twisted non - associative theory is fully equivalent to the original associative one_. this is an important requirement from a deformation - theoretic point of view ; if one thinks of the twisting as quantisation , this is an extension of the correspondence principle from classical gauge theory to gauge theory on the quantum ( possibly nonassociative ) space .",
    "on the other hand , computed entirely in the nonassociative deformed category , the gauge theory appears quite different . remembering that the products are quasi - associative , we must fix brackettings when translating the diagrams into algebra and we do so by a convention to bracket by default to the left , inserting associators @xmath25 according to mac lane s coherence theorem whenever a different bracketting is needed .",
    "thus for example , @xmath181 as a morphism @xmath182",
    ". provided one inserts @xmath25 as specified ( and where there is more than one way to do it one has the same result for any choice ) , the diagrammatic proof in section  3.1 becomes an algebraic proof that @xmath183 obeys @xmath184 i.e. the fundamental lemma of ( nonasociative ) gauge theory .",
    "when there are matter fields we have similarly @xmath185      finally , let us give a canonical example of an equivariant gauge theory and its twisting , that requires only the data for a cochain quantisation as in section  2 , i.e. there is a canonical choice of @xmath161 .",
    "thus , let @xmath16 be a hopf algebra and @xmath29 and algebra with calculus which is @xmath16-covariant",
    ". we then set @xmath186 as a coalgebra , @xmath187 ( the coproduct of @xmath16 , ignoring the algebra structure of @xmath16 ) .",

    "the requirement that the coaction : @xmath196 is a morphism makes @xmath197 into some form of hopf module , i.e. a vector space on which @xmath16 both acts and coacts in a suitably compatible manner , namely here @xmath198 hopf modules are fully determined by their space @xmath199 of elements invariant under the coaction .",
    "the hopf module - lemma ensures that these invariant elements @xmath200 generate all of @xmath197 through the action .",
    "note that this is usually done for action and coaction in the same side but with care works also in our case where the action is a left one and the coaction a right one .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath201 where the antipode @xmath202 of the hopf algebra is assumed to be invertible and where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are standard hopf algebra notations .",
    "it is straightforward to see then that these two maps are mutually inverse , so @xmath205 and that the second map indeed lands in @xmath206 ( this is not obvious but can be checked using routine hopf algebra methods ) .",
    "conversely , given any vector space @xmath207 we can define @xmath208 with action and coaction of @xmath16 @xmath209 and check that @xmath210 ; the above tells us that any crossed module @xmath197 is equivalent to one of this standard type . in short ,",
    "the input data for matter fields in the theory boils down to choosing a vector space .    moreover , since @xmath211 is assumed to be @xmath16-covariant , it us fully determined by its values on this vector space @xmath212 , since @xmath213 for any basis @xmath214 of @xmath212 .",
    "so the gauge theory above is equivalent to specifying a map @xmath215 or a multiplet of matter fields @xmath216 if we fix a basis of @xmath212 .",
    "thus our theory becomes equivalent to usual @xmath1-theory with a multitplet of matter fields .",
    "indeed , @xmath217 obeys @xmath218 as would be expected for @xmath1 fields .",
    "we now ready simply to twist this theory using the method in section  3.2 .",
    "@xmath171 now has deformed coproduct @xmath219 . a gauge field",
    "is again determined by @xmath220 but @xmath221 so @xmath222 @xmath223 in terms of the deformed bullet product on @xmath224 .",
    "as above , our convention is to read the diagrams with brackets accumulating to the left , with @xmath25 to be inserted as needed for any other bracketting that may be required .",
    "the expressions above will be equal as linear maps to @xmath225 , etc . as explained in section  3.2 ,",
    "so the deformed theory is in correspondence with the original theory before twisting , but is well - formed in its own right .    finally , if we have matter fields and elements @xmath226 that are invariant under the coaction , then the deformed coaction and hence gauge transform of matter fields is @xmath227 here we see that as with the gauge fields above , it is the entire amplified theory that twists into a nonassociative one .",
    "it remains , however , equivalent to the @xmath1-gauge theory with matter .",
    "in this section we illustrate the above formalism on the example of quasi-@xmath5 .",
    "to be concrete , we focus calculations on the main example where @xmath228 in section  2.1 , but the same methods apply for the other versions of quasi-@xmath5 .",
    "we start with the algebra and differentials in more detail , and then turn to the gauge theory .      from section  2.1 , we have @xmath229 where we use @xmath73 to lower indices .",
    "we call this algebra @xmath230 ; the case in string theory is with @xmath231 .",
    "for example , with the usual coordinates @xmath232 of @xmath5 we have the bullet product @xmath233 which is a simplified version @xcite of higher - dimensional fuzzy spheres that arise from the truncated matrix product in certain string matrix models . here",
    "@xmath234 is a truncation order and the algebra becomes associative as @xmath235 .    for our purposes",
    "we also need a differential calculus and we use the same @xmath21 built from @xmath68 but now with the @xmath236 acting by lie derivative on differential forms .",
    "then the usual @xmath237 deforms to a ( nonassociative ) @xmath238 .",

    "this deformed ` quasidifferential calculus ' is the classical one at lowest order and but differentials of functions of degree @xmath85 will be modified by descendants of lower degree . because @xmath244 the relations involving @xmath245 are necessarily unchanged , @xmath246      we are now ready to construct gauge theory on the above fuzzy @xmath0 using the general construction in section  3.3 .",
    "first of all , we recall that here @xmath247 $ ] has coproduct @xmath248 on the generators .",
    "we take for @xmath161 the same coalgebra , but to avoid confusion we denote this second copy @xmath249 $ ] with polynomial generators @xmath250 . as before , we use a fixed ( say euclidean ) @xmath73 to lower indices .",
    "a gauge field is a covariant map @xmath251",
    "so it is first of all a collection of 1-forms @xmath252 etc . in @xmath253 .",
    "however , that @xmath11 is a morphism requires @xmath254 where @xmath255 denotes the lie derivative by the vector field @xmath236 acting here on 1-forms .",
    "this is just action by @xmath236 on the components @xmath256 in the coordinate basis .",
    "this is how @xmath257 is determined from @xmath258 . similarly @xmath259 and similarly for @xmath149 .",
    "this inverse is defined by the ` convolution product ' , which involves the coproduct above , so for example @xmath260 @xmath261 etc . , which agrees with @xmath262 etc .",
    ", as required by covariance . similarly , we know that @xmath263 . for higher order",
    "we compute the convolution product as @xmath264 as it should as all our constructions are covariant under @xmath16 .",
    "likewise , we know that @xmath265 . at next order we have @xmath266 as it should . thus the higher @xmath267 etc .",
    ", behave like further auxiliary classical @xmath1- gauge fields but are in fact determined from the @xmath220 gauge theory .",
    "this gives the flavour of the amplified theory and its equivalence with usual @xmath1 theory on @xmath5 .",
    "next we deform to the coproduct of @xmath171 , @xmath268 the action of @xmath16 on @xmath161 is multiplication by @xmath269 .",
    "as explained in section  3.3 a gauge field still means an @xmath16-covariant map determined by @xmath270 , i.e. some differential form @xmath271 .",
    "its curvature from section  3.3 is @xmath272 we know from the equivalence with the classical gauge theory that this will in fact equal @xmath273 but this is a non - trivial computation from the point of view of the nonassociative theory .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath274 and hence @xmath275 where the first term can again be expanded as a powerseries as we have done for the second term .",
    "the action of a @xmath236 on @xmath11 is understood here to be via the lie derivative .",
    "the second term is pure gauge and we know by the equivalence with the untwisted theory that it is equal to @xmath276 and hence its curvature is zero , as promised . from the point of view of the nonassociative theory , however , these are nontrivial powerseries in the @xmath4 product .",
    "matter fields if present can similarly be included according to the theory at the end of section  3.3 .",
    "here we illustrate the formalism of section 3 on the octonions viewed as a nonassociative coordinate ring obtained by quantising the classical space @xmath277 .",
    "the first section makes this point of view precise and is a main result of the paper .",
    "we then consider gauge theory on this space .",
    "the ` classical ' algebra of functions in the form of the group algebra @xmath278 before deformation is generated by commuting @xmath279 say with @xmath280 .",
    "a general basis element is @xmath281 the deformed product has relations @xmath282 which is indeed the usual octonions if one puts @xmath283 and @xmath284 . here",
    "@xmath285 which ensures that @xmath286 as it should .",
    "similarly one may check that @xmath287 and so forth .",
    "note that @xmath288 whenever @xmath289 are linearly dependent over @xmath110 .",
    "this expresses the ` alternativity ' property of the octions in our formulation .",
    "next , the ` classical ' differential calculus on @xmath29 is fixed as follows . by fourier",
    "transform @xmath290 where @xmath291 is position space if the previous @xmath2 above was momentum space .",
    "each @xmath292 of position space is a finite set of two points and it has only one possible differential calculus , the universal one .",
    "it is then natural to take the three copies commuting ( direct product calculus ) , giving @xmath293 and cyclic rotations .",
    "the wedge product is then fixed by the graded leibniz rule as @xmath294 and cyclic rotations of this .",
    "notice that the more important objects here are the left - invariant closed 1-forms @xmath295 and the geometrical picture is that of a 3-torus with the circle @xmath296 approximated by @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , the calculus has noncommutative de rahm cohomology generated by these @xmath297 , exactly as for a classical 3-torus .",
    "these @xmath297 anti - commute among themselves in the wedge product and @xmath298 we see that there is only a small amount of noncommutativity in our ` classical ' calculus attributable to the discrete nature of the underlying space .    the geometric picture here is clearer after making the above fourier transform explicit .",
    "thus , let @xmath299 be the plane waves , where @xmath300 is a point in position space ( a @xmath110-valued vector ) .",
    "the exterior derivative here is @xmath301 where @xmath236 is the finite - difference operator in the @xmath302-direction .",
    "we see that the differentials act by multiplication in momentum space .",
    "in general , the fourier transform of @xmath303 is a function @xmath304 on momentum space characterised by @xmath305 .",
    "the inverse is @xmath306 now , we have given the @xmath4 deformation of @xmath2 into the octonions in momentum space as multiplication by @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath307 be the same function before fourier transform .",
    "then @xmath308 here @xmath309 where we do the @xmath310 summation which gives a constraint @xmath311 which eliminates @xmath312 ; then we do the @xmath313 summation to obtain a constraint @xmath314 to eliminate @xmath315 .",
    "we next do the @xmath316 summation to obtain a constraint @xmath317 , giving @xmath318 we see that _ the cochain @xmath21 that defines the octonions has the remarkable property that up to a relabelling , it is its own fourier transform _ , i.e. @xmath319 has just the same form in position space as @xmath3 in momentum space after a rotation of the indices @xmath320 .",
    "note that the factor 8 in @xmath319 is an artefact due to our use of @xmath321 on one side of each fourier transform rather than a symmetrical @xmath322 .",
    "note also that @xmath323 where @xmath324 is translation in the @xmath302 direction .",
    "since @xmath325 , we have @xmath326 which expresses the above result as a finite ` bidifferential ' operator @xmath327 these results have been obtained with mathematica .",
    "this makes precise the sense in which , in finite geometry , the octonions are a ` quantisation ' of functions on @xmath2 .    for comparison ,",
    "if we do the same for the cochain that defines clifford algebras as a simpler associative quantisation of @xmath89 , we have @xmath328@xmath329 the derivation of the latter is rather simpler than the above ; we compute @xmath330 where we do the @xmath310 integral to obtain the constraint @xmath331 , and change variables @xmath332 in the result .",
    "what we obtain is @xmath319 for @xmath333 in the remaining variables .",
    "the above then follows by induction . the @xmath4-product description of the clifford algebra in @xmath334-dimensions is then given as a quantisation of @xmath89 by this @xmath319 by a similar formula as above .",
    "for example , for @xmath335 we have @xmath336    finally , we turn to the differential geometry of the octonions . as a cochain twist",
    "we have that the relations involving the left - invariant forms @xmath297 are unchanged ( because @xmath21 acts trivially on them ) .",
    "hence @xmath337 in this basis . for a more algebraic picture within the octonions ,",
    "let us also consider @xmath338 after a short computation using @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "since the @xmath339 have square 1 with their initial product , and from the form of @xmath340 above , we know that @xmath341 with the exception of @xmath342 .",
    "so these are all ` unit octonions ' .",
    "moreover , from the above , @xmath343 in this basis .",
    "we can then deduce @xmath344 where inverse is in the octonions or bullet product algebra and eventually that @xmath345 @xmath346 and cyclic rotations of this .",
    "the latter are obtained by applying @xmath37 and the graded - leibniz rule which still holds .",
    "one can also obtain these results by direct computation from the action of @xmath21 and the initial calculus on @xmath2 as in @xcite .",
    "we have a basis of @xmath16 given by the @xmath347-functions @xmath91 on momentum space , with coalgebra @xmath348 their action on @xmath349 is @xmath350 i.e. it projects out the corresponding term in the fourier expansion and behaves as shown on products .",
    "we use the same coalgebra @xmath161 with the same basis element @xmath351 denoted @xmath352 to avoid confusion and the same form of coproduct as above .",
    "the action of @xmath16 is by @xmath353 .",
    "a gauge field is then a covariant map @xmath354 , i.e. a collection of 1-forms @xmath355 where the @xmath16 acts trivially on the @xmath297 as explained in section  5.1 .",
    "thus the collection is fully determined from @xmath356 .",
    "similarly the collection @xmath357 is determined from the point - wise invertible function @xmath358 in @xmath359 .",
    "the inverse @xmath360 .",
    "more generally @xmath361 which is consistent with @xmath362 .",
    "a gauge transform of @xmath220 is as usual @xmath363 where there is a sum over @xmath302 and @xmath364 .",
    "note that unlike the fuzzy @xmath5 case the initial @xmath1 theory already has a nontrivial conjugation because functions do not commute with the @xmath297 basic 1-forms .",
    "the change of variables to @xmath365 is quite useful ( see the next section ) and @xmath366 transform by conjugation . for other components we have @xmath367 as it should . for the last step",
    "we identify @xmath368 as @xmath369 and use the action of @xmath351 on triple product along the lines of its action on a product explained above .",
    "thus the theory looks like a collection of 1-forms with gauge - like transformation properties but determined consistently from the single theory for @xmath220 .",
    "similarly , for the curvature we have @xmath370 where @xmath371 as the @xmath297 anticommute .",
    "this is a standard form for the @xmath1-yang - mills curvature on a discrete space in noncommutative geometry .",
    "the other components may similarly be computed as @xmath372 as it should , where @xmath351 acts on the coefficients of @xmath373 , i.e. the other components have a similar form but are determined by @xmath374 .",
    "the above ` amplification ' of @xmath220 to a collection of gauge fields can be made even more explicit by different basis @xmath375 of @xmath16 where @xmath376 .",
    "these elements have @xmath377 ( this is the isomorphism @xmath378 ) .",
    "they act on functions by @xmath379 and @xmath380 behave more explicitly like @xmath220 , which is one of the collection via @xmath381 .",
    "we now turn to the twisted nonassociative theory .",
    "the coproduct of @xmath171 is @xmath382 where the cochain and its fourier transform are ( if we wan the octonions ) as in section  5.1 .",
    "as explained in section  3.3 a gauge field still means an @xmath16-covariant map determined by @xmath383 , i.e. some differential form @xmath384 ( sum over @xmath302 ) .",
    "the curvature according to section  3.3 , is @xmath385 similarly , we have @xmath386 for the particular form of @xmath21 for the octonions ( which is linear in the exponent with respect to the first argument ) . then @xmath387 matter fields",
    "can similarly be included from the general theory in section 3.3 .",
    "next , although our view of the octonions as a nonassociative quantisation of functions on the cube is the geometrical one , it remains very convenient to work with our original plane - wave basis @xmath388 for calculations . here",
    "@xmath389 acts diagonally by as multiplication by @xmath390 on an element of degree @xmath391 .",
    "here the degree is multiplicative and @xmath37 does not change degree , so for example @xmath392 has degree @xmath393 .",
    "similarly after deformation with the @xmath394 . here for example @xmath395 etc .",
    "the hard part from this point of view is to find the inverse in the undeformed algebra of a general gauge transformation @xmath396 .",
    "the answer is to construct @xmath397 by fourier transform of the inversion operation : @xmath398 where we require the @xmath399 ( the sum in the denominator ) to be non - zero for each @xmath400 , i.e. all signed sums of the @xmath401 coefficients should be non - zero .",
    "otherwise , since the action of @xmath351 on any expression in the exterior algebra is to pick out the degree @xmath391 part , we have more simply in this basis : @xmath8 @xmath402 where the sum is over the different graded components of each object and to this end @xmath10 denotes a second independent copy of @xmath11 .",
    "also , we omit writing that these are the gauge and other fields at 1 , i.e. @xmath403 etc . even though the amplification to the collection of fields is needed for the diagrammatic picture of section  3.1 , all formulae are by now referred back to their values on 1 .",
    "if one wants to be more explicit and write the homogeneous degree components explicitly , we have @xmath404 @xmath405 where @xmath406 is the decomposition into homogeneous components ( this is a slightly different notation from the fourier decomposition of @xmath120 into components @xmath407 ) . the fuzzy-@xmath0 example in section  4.2",
    "can likewise be computed more simply in this momentum space point of view .",
    "finally , we demonstrate this gauge theory with an example of a completely explicit computation .",

    "moreover , stepping in the @xmath302 direction carries over @xmath446 to the entire adjacent quadrant , but none of the other information .",
    "similarly stepping in the @xmath456 direction carries over @xmath472 to that quadrant .",
    "we then relate the quadrants by further analysis ; see the example below",
    ".    one may proceed in this way to classify the cases with more and more assumed degeneracy . among the solutions",
    "are those of the same form as the constant maximal case above but allowing any of the @xmath446 .",
    "these are multiply - split solutions and include each @xmath297 alone as a zero - curvature flat connection , as well as @xmath473 .    to be concrete we now offer a complete classification for @xmath114 and @xmath335 which demonstrates the method .",
    "the @xmath335 case is in correspondence with solutions on the octonions by twisting as we have mentioned .",
    "\\(ii ) we have a splitting @xmath475 , with @xmath476 unconstrained other than being constant in the @xmath477-direction , i.e. @xmath478 where @xmath77 is a function just in the @xmath479 variable and up to gauge equivalence can be taken real and non - negative in its values . similarly for a splitting @xmath480 : @xmath481 for a real and non - negative function @xmath77 of @xmath482 alone .",
    "\\(ii ) we have a splitting @xmath484 : @xmath485 where @xmath486 correspond to two independent solutions on the @xmath13 subsets ( faces ) with @xmath487 and @xmath488 respectively . up",
    "to gauge transformation they can be taken real and positive , i.e. without phases . similarly in the other two directions .",
    "\\(iii ) we suppose that there does not exist a splitting , but there does exist a point with , say , @xmath489 and @xmath490 .",
    "to be concrete let this point be @xmath29 the origin in the standard cube shown in figure  2 .",
    "these are also the values at @xmath16 by the above argument ; the equal value of @xmath491 is shown in part ( a ) of the figure by labelling the arrowed edge , and such a nonzero edge transports the other values from @xmath29 to @xmath16 by the arguments above .",
    "we also see that @xmath484 at @xmath161 and @xmath98 , while @xmath492 at @xmath83 and @xmath493 , by the reality condition .",
    "now suppose that @xmath495 at corners @xmath161 and @xmath496 ( the two must be the same value ) as shown by the arrowed edge in figure  2(b ) . then at @xmath161 we must have @xmath497 to avoid a split ( to avoid the existence of a point with two non - zero @xmath449 ) . in this case @xmath498 also at @xmath496 . hence @xmath484 at @xmath83 .",
    "we conclude also that @xmath497 at @xmath83 ( and hence all @xmath446 at @xmath83 ) for if not , we could deduce the same values at @xmath493 and hence that @xmath484 at @xmath21 , which would be a split with @xmath475 .",
    "then @xmath499 at @xmath493 and @xmath21 ( to avoid a split with @xmath475 ) . hence @xmath500 at @xmath493 and @xmath21 .",
    "hence @xmath492 also at @xmath98 , and since @xmath497 at @xmath29 it must also vanish at @xmath98 , i.e. all three @xmath449 vanish at @xmath98 .",
    "the solution is then fully determined by the three non - zero values @xmath501 and all three @xmath449 vanishing at @xmath502 as shown in part ( b ) of the figure .",
    "we mark only the non - zero edges , which imply those value on their endpoints ; all other values are zero .    alternatively , if @xmath492 at @xmath161 and @xmath496 , then @xmath495 at @xmath21 and @xmath98 ( the arrowed edge shown in figure  2 part ( c ) ) to avoid a split with @xmath480 . hence @xmath497 at @xmath98 to avoid a maximal solution , and hence also at @xmath161 ( so all three @xmath446 at @xmath161 ) .",
    "moreover , the values @xmath498 are transported to @xmath21 .",
    "hence @xmath497 at @xmath496 also , and @xmath484 at @xmath493 also . finally , @xmath499 at @xmath503 ( the final arrowed edge shown in part ( c ) ) to avoid a split @xmath504 .",
    "this transports @xmath497 also to @xmath83 and hence to @xmath493 , therefore we deduce the mirror image solution to the one above , where the @xmath446 now at @xmath505 as shown in part ( c ) of the figure .",
    "the explicit formula in the first case , if @xmath29 is the origin of a standard cube , is @xmath506 of course , we can rotate this solution by picking any other origin and initial non - zero edge , and we also have the mirror image solution .",
    "finally , phases can be removed by gauge transformation in a similar manner to the above .",
