    "particularly interesting is the case @xmath46 , in which case theorem [ thbm ] tells us that the amount of concentration of curvature @xmath47 at each blow - up point is at least @xmath48 , which is _ half _ of the total curvature of @xmath49 . on the other hand , as shown by y - y .",
    "li and i. shafrir @xcite , if one assumes that @xmath50 in @xmath51 , then a stronger and subtle quantization result holds , namely @xmath47 is an integer multiple of @xmath52 .",
    "this result was then extended to higher even dimension @xmath53 in the context of @xmath54-curvature and gjms - operators by several authors @xcite , always under the strong assumption that the curvatures are continuous and converge in @xmath55 ( sometimes even in @xmath56 ) , but , at least in @xcite giving up the requirement that the curvatures are non - negative .",
    "the main ingredient here is that for uniformly continuous curvatures , in case of blow - up one can dilate the metrics and reduce to the case of constant curvature , proving that the curvature at a blow - up point is necessarily positive ( by results of @xcite ) . finally positive and constant",
    "curvature leads to spherical metrics , thanks to various classification results ( e.g. @xcite ) , and this is in turn responsible for the constant @xmath52 ( or higher - dimensional analogs ) in the quantization results , i.e. at each blow - up point the total curvature of a sphere ( of the appropriate dimension ) concentrates .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens if we remove _ both _ the positivity and uniform continuity assumptions on the curvature , only relying on an arbitrary @xmath4 bound .",

    "this is turn will be reduced to a theorem of differential topology about the degree of closed curves in the plane , inspired by a classical work of s. j. blank @xcite , and to the blow - up analysis provided in @xcite , which will allow us to choose a suitable blow - up scale and estimate the curvature left in the other scales .",

    "<S> in this paper we perform a blow - up and quantization analysis of the fractional liouville equation in dimension @xmath0 . more precisely , given a sequence @xmath1 of solutions to @xmath2 with @xmath3 bounded in @xmath4 and @xmath5 bounded in @xmath6 uniformly with respect to @xmath7 , we show that up to extracting a subsequence @xmath8 can blow - up at ( at most ) finitely many points @xmath9 and either ( i ) @xmath10 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , or ( ii ) @xmath13 uniformly locally in @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 for every @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this result , resting on the geometric interpretation and analysis of provided in a recent collaboration of the authors with t. rivire and on a classical work of blank about immersions of the disk into the plane , is a fractional counterpart of the celebrated works of brzis - merle and li - shafrir on the @xmath18-dimensional liouville equation , but providing sharp quantization estimates ( @xmath19 and @xmath16 ) which are not known in dimension @xmath18 under the weak assumption that @xmath20 be bounded in @xmath4 and is allowed to change sign . </S>"
