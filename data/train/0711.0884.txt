    "macroscopic periodic oscillations are ubiquitous in living organisms , and span a broad range of time scales , from fractions of a second such as in neural and heart tissues to days or weeks such as in circadian rhythms and menstrual cycles . the possibility that this kind of macroscopic dynamics is the collective manifestation of mutual synchronization of microscopic oscillations was advanced by n. wiener in the 1940s @xcite , and was later elaborated by a. t. winfree @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism assumed to be at work in this self - organization phenomenon is that a few elements in a population of interacting oscillators may synchronize if they have similar frequencies and their coupling is strong enough . under suitable conditions , other oscillators may in turn",
    "be entrained by this `` nucleation center '' and , eventually , contribute to form a macroscopic oscillating cluster .",
    "collective oscillations would thus emerge as the result of coherent microscopic dynamics , through a process not unlike a condensation phase transition @xcite .",
    "this conceptual idea was realized into an explicit model by y. kuramoto @xcite , who considered the collective dynamics of an ensemble of @xmath0 globally coupled phase oscillators .",
    "the state of each oscillator is defined by its phase @xmath1 .",
    "their joint evolution is governed by the equations @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) where @xmath4 is the natural frequency of oscillator @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the strength of their global ( all - to - all ) coupling . in this system , synchronized states can be characterized by the distribution of effective frequencies @xmath7 .",
    "the effective frequency of an oscillator is defined as the time average of its phase velocity : @xmath8 it is found that , for sufficiently large @xmath6 , there is a group of oscillators whose effective frequencies are identical .",
    "the number of these synchronized oscillators increases with @xmath6 .",
    "synchronization implies as well a certain degree of order in the distribution of the individual oscillator phases .",
    "this is revealed by the complex order parameter @xmath9 = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp",
    "\\left [ { \\rm i } \\phi_j(t ) \\right ]   .\\ ] ] kuramoto showed that in the limit @xmath10 , and under the assumption that synchronized oscillators form a single group with effective frequency @xmath11 , the collective amplitude @xmath12 which turns out to be independent of time vanishes for coupling intensities below a certain critical value @xmath13 , and is different from zero for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the threshold @xmath13 of the synchronization transition is determined by the distribution of natural frequencies @xmath4 : ensembles with wider frequency distributions require stronger coupling to become synchronized . as a byproduct of the formulation , the synchronization frequency @xmath15 is also obtained , and @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 can be interpreted as a mean field generated by the oscillator ensemble .",
    "in fact , @xmath18 and @xmath19 define , respectively , the collective amplitude and phase of the ensemble . the evolution equation ( [ kura1 ] ) for each oscillator can be rewritten as @xmath20 the coupling of oscillator @xmath5 with the ensemble is thus represented as the interaction with a single , equivalent oscillator of phase @xmath21 , weighted by the amplitude @xmath12 .    the synchronization transition results from the competing effect of two factors :",
    "while coupling induces the emergence of ordered dynamics , the heterogeneity in the distribution of natural frequencies favours incoherent behaviour @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to incorporate two additional sources of heterogeneity to kuramoto s model .",
    "first , we consider that each oscillator @xmath5 is coupled to the mean field @xmath22 with its own coupling intensity @xmath23 .",
    "second , we assume that the individual contribution of each oscillator to the mean field is weighted by a factor @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast with natural frequencies , which determine the individual dynamics in the absence of coupling , the two new attributes @xmath23 and @xmath24 affect the way in which each oscillator interacts with the ensemble .",
    "therefore , they define a heterogeneous interaction pattern underlying the system .",
    "heterogeneity is a widespread feature in multi - agent systems .",
    "constitutional differences between the members of such systems imply variations in the individual dynamics , in the response to external influxes , in the interaction with other elements , etc",
    ". those differences may also have non - trivial effects on the collective dynamics of the ensemble @xcite .",
    "in connection with a more realistic representation of both natural and artificial systems , it is therefore desirable to generalize standard models in order to encompass heterogeneity .",
    "the present extension of the phase - oscillator model has the additional interest of being analytically tractable through a rather straightforward generalization of kuramoto s theory .",
    "in fact , in the limit of an infinitely large ensemble , the synchronization transition , as well as the collective dynamical properties of the synchronized state , can be fully characterized in the frame of such generalization .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how kuramoto s theory is extended to include the form of heterogeneous coupling advanced above .",
    "we establish self - consistency equations for the collective amplitude and the synchronization frequency , and find the frequency distribution of non - synchronized oscillators . in section [ sect2 ] , the results of section [ sect1 ] are applied to analyze synchronization properties in several specific cases , paying special attention to the effect of correlations between the different attributes of individual oscillators . in particular , we show that anti - correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 can completely suppress synchronized states .",
    "numerical results for finite systems are presented in section [ num ] , which validate analytical predictions and , at the same time , show that finite - size effects play an important role in the collective dynamics close to the synchronization transition . in this region , partial synchronization in the form of frequency clustering not predicted by the analytical approach is observed .",

    ", a horizontal array of dots corresponding to oscillators with different natural frequencies but the same effective frequency reveals the presence of a synchronized cluster .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays such plots for the four cases already considered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the upper line , couplings are constant , @xmath178 for all @xmath5 , while in the lower line they are uniformly distributed between @xmath179 and @xmath180 . in both cases , thus , the system is just below the synchronization threshold .",
    "the appearance of synchronized clusters near the center of the frequency distribution is apparent in the four plots .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows again that , for a given distribution of couplings , there is little qualitative difference between the cases where the weights @xmath24 are either constant or distributed . on the other hand , we find that for oscillators with a given natural frequency , the effective frequencies are essentially identical in the case of constant couplings , but exhibit a substantial dispersion for distributed couplings .",
    "this difference can be understood by extrapolating our analytical results for the synchronization regime to the present situation , just below the transition .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ omef ] ) implies that , for a given natural frequency , the effective frequency depends on @xmath23 , so that we expect to have the same value of @xmath7 in the case of uniform coupling , and different values if couplings are distributed .",
    "it also predicts that the effective frequency of a given oscillator should be smaller than its natural frequency when the latter is larger than the synchronization frequency @xmath15 , and _ vice versa_. we see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that our numerical calculations , for which @xmath181 , agree with such prediction .    our previous results for the case of constant weights @xcite , which we do not reproduce here , suggest that the regime of frequency clustering is a finite - size effect due to fluctuations in the distribution of natural frequencies .",
    "an unusual accumulation of oscillators in a given frequency interval can trigger local entrainment for couplings below the transition to synchronization .",
    "numerical results show that clustering becomes less important , with a smaller fraction of entrained oscillators , as the ensemble grows in size . in the limit of an infinitely large system",
    ", fluctuations should average out and synchronization should switch on at the analytically predicted threshold , with the formation of a macroscopic cluster .",
    "however , the fact the frequency clustering is still conspicuous in a relatively large ensemble as in our calculations seems to point out that this regime plays a relevant role in the collective dynamics of finite systems .",
    "we turn now the attention to the case discussed in section [ wcc1 ] , where couplings and weights are correlated . as",
    "above , couplings are uniformly distributed on @xmath175 , and the weight of each oscillator is given as function of its coupling through eq .",
    "( [ expon ] ) .",
    "we focus on the more interesting case of weight - coupling anti - correlation , where synchronization suppression is possible , so that we take @xmath149 .",
    "results are thus presented in terms of the positive parameter @xmath182 .",
    "we recall that , in our analysis of infinitely large ensembles , eq .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) predicts the relation between @xmath153 and @xmath152 at the synchronization threshold .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the region of the @xmath183 parameter plane where synchronized states are possible .",
    "synchronization is suppressed for small couplings and strong weight - coupling anti - correlation . in particular",
    ", it can not occur for any @xmath184 if @xmath185 , or for any @xmath152 if @xmath186 .",
    "inserts in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] illustrate the relation of effective and natural frequencies at several points in the parameter plane .    for small values of @xmath184 , the main effect of weight - coupling anti - correlation is to shift the synchronization transition to higher couplings .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the fraction of synchronized oscillators is plotted as a function of @xmath152 for four values of @xmath184 .",
    "full lines correspond to the analytical prediction , which again gives a very good description of the numerical results above the transition , at least for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "dotted lines are plotted as a guide to the eye in the region preceding the synchronization transition . for @xmath189 ,",
    "the systems is practically at the limit where synchronization becomes inhibited for any @xmath152 .",
    "the analytical transition point is strongly shifted to the right , but a considerable fraction of the ensemble is synchronized in clusters well below the transition .",
    "note that a discrepancy between numerical and analytical results persists above the critical point .",
    "finally , for @xmath190 , synchronization should be completely suppressed for infinitely large systems . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "a small fraction of the ensemble which grows with @xmath152 is however synchronized .",
    "it turns out that the quantities that characterize synchronization in the clustering regime such as the fraction of synchronized oscillators , and the number of clusters depend strongly on the value of @xmath152 .",
    "this is illustrated , for instance , by the two inserts of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] corresponding to parameters just outside the synchronization region . for @xmath191 ,",
    "clusters are small and relatively sparse , and most effective frequencies are close to the corresponding natural frequencies ( all dots are near the diagonal ) . for @xmath192 , on the other hand , a substantial fraction of the ensemble around the center of the frequency distribution is entrained into clusters , and form massive groups extended over considerable intervals of natural frequencies .",
    "this effect can be understood taking into account that a fluctuation in the distribution of frequencies is more likely to give rise to a synchronized cluster if the involved oscillators have , on the average , larger couplings .",
    "a more quantitative illustration of this dependence on @xmath152 is provided by the numerical results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the fraction @xmath173 of synchronized oscillators as a function of @xmath184 , for @xmath191 .",
    "the curve corresponds to the analytical prediction . for @xmath184 larger than the critical value",
    ", @xmath173 decreases rapidly , such that only @xmath193 of the ensemble remains clustered for @xmath194 . in the lower panel",
    ", we plot the corresponding number of clusters , @xmath195 .",
    "below the transition , in the synchronization region , @xmath196 .",
    "around the transition point , the number of clusters increases abruptly , and reaches a maximum just below @xmath197 , before beginning to decline for larger @xmath184 .    for @xmath192 ,",
    "the behaviour of both @xmath173 and @xmath195 is qualitatively similar , but important quantitative differences are apparent .",
    "first , the fraction of synchronized oscillators in the clustering region is much higher and its decay is slower , with approximately @xmath198 of the ensemble still entrained into clusters for @xmath199 .",
    "second , the number of clusters at the transition grows above @xmath200 , and the subsequent decay is extremely slow . for values of @xmath184 twice as large as the critical point , @xmath195 remains practically as large as just above the transition .",
    "in this paper , we have considered an ensemble of coupled phase oscillators where the strength of the interaction is generally different for each oscillator pair .",
    "this heterogeneity is represented by symmetric positive interaction coefficients @xmath201 and , together with the distribution of natural frequencies @xmath4 , adds diversity to the ensemble .",
    "our main goal has been to show that kuramoto s theory for the synchronization transition of an infinitely large ensemble of globally coupled phase oscillators can be extended to the case of heterogeneous coupling , yielding exact results when the interaction coefficients can be factorized as @xmath202 .",
    "the factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 turn out to be , respectively , the coupling strength of oscillator @xmath5 with the mean field generated by the ensemble , and the weight with which the same oscillator contributes to that mean field .",
    "the three attributes that characterize each oscillator , @xmath4 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , are distributed over the ensemble according to a function @xmath73 which , in general , introduces statistical correlations between them .    in the analysis of our results ,",
    "we have paid particular attention to the effects of correlations between natural frequencies @xmath4 , couplings @xmath23 , and weights @xmath24 . as it may have been expected ,",
    "if the couplings and/or the weights of the oscillators which trigger synchronization around the center of the frequency distribution are relatively small , an overall larger coupling will be necessary to effectively have synchronized states .",
    "the effect of correlations between couplings and weights , on the other hand , is less obvious .",
    "we have found that a sufficiently strong anti - correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is able to completely inhibit synchronization , in the sense that synchronized states are suppressed even in the presence of arbitrarily large couplings .",
    "in other words , if the mean field is strongly dominated by oscillators whose coupling is weak , and _",
    "vice versa _ , the ensemble may be unable to display coherent collective oscillations .    as a validation of the analytical formulation , we have performed numerical calculations for ensembles of @xmath203 oscillators , with several combinations of the distribution of couplings and weights .",
    "numerical and analytical results are in good overall agreement , except for a systematic departure in the parameter regions where the synchronization transition takes place . in these zones ,",
    "numerical results reveal the existence of a regime of partial synchronization , where oscillators become entrained into several internally synchronized clusters . as the transition",
    "is approached , these clusters grow in size and , at the same time , they progressively aggregate with each other . eventually , they collapse into a single cluster , which can be identified with the macroscopic fraction of synchronized oscillators predicted by the analytical formulation .",
    "previous numerical results on a special case of the present system @xcite , seem to indicate that frequency clustering is a finite - size effect which disappears for infinitely large systems where , precisely , the analytical approach is formulated . in finite ensembles , clusters may emerge from localized fluctuations in the distribution of frequencies and couplings , which trigger the mutual synchronization of a few oscillators .",
    "the regime of clustering preceding the transition to synchronization found in our system , is reminiscent of a similar phenomenon well - known to occur in ensembles of coupled chaotic elements @xcite . in the present case , heterogeneity in the ensemble replaces chaotic dynamics as the factor which counteracts the effects of coupling and gives origin to the transition . in spite of the fact that it may disappear in the thermodynamical limit",
    ", clustering remains the richest dynamical regime of oscillator ensembles because of its complexity and diversity @xcite .    in connection with chaotic systems , it would be interesting to study whether the introduction of coupling heterogeneity in ensembles of chaotic dynamical elements have effects similar to those described here for the synchronization transition of phase oscillators .",
    "more complex individual dynamics are also expected to give rise to new collective phenomena , such as amplitude effects . distributed couplings @xmath23 and weights @xmath24 can be straightforwardly incorporated to standard models of interacting chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , linear heterogeneous coupling between @xmath0 chaotic elements whose individual dynamics is governed by the equation @xmath204 may be introduced as @xmath205 @xmath206 , with @xmath207 . finally , let us point out that kuramoto s theory has been extended , at least partially , to study the synchronization properties of ensembles formed by other kinds of dynamical elements , in particular , by active rotators @xcite .",
