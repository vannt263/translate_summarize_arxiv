    "an ultrashort optical pulse is a pulse of light of duration less than @xmath010 optical periods , where the optical period is calculated from the dominant wavelength in the pulse spectrum .",
    "such ultrashort pulses are generated with commonly implemented mode  locked lasers , and several schemes for compressing and amplifying them have been formulated  @xcite .",
    "optical pulses are used for micromachining  @xcite , lidar  @xcite , and quantum control and probing of wavepackets and chemical reactions  @xcite ; and their use has been suggested for telecommunications  @xcite .    it is necessary to understand how ultrashort optical pulses propagate in materials in order to design new materials and devices to manipulate them .",
    "earlier , we reported on the spatiotemporal evolution of ultrashort optical pulses as they propagate through complex nano  engineered materials called sculptured thin films ( stfs ) . a stf is a unidirectionally nonhomogeneous , anisotropic medium whose morphology , which consists of an array of parallel shaped nanowires , is engineered by design  @xcite .",
    "the morphology of stfs may break certain translational and rotational symmetries , and these films possess dispersive dielectric and possibly dispersive magnetic properties in the optical regime .",
    "the circular bragg phenomenon is exhibited by chiral stfs due to their periodic nonhomogeneity and structural chirality arising from the constituent nanowires being nanohelixes as shown in the electron micrograph of figure  [ f : chiral stf ] .",
    "as circularly polarized monochromatic light propagates through vacuum , the electric field traces out a helix .",
    "if the handedness of this helix matches that of the nanohelixes in a chiral stf , and if the wavelength of the light lies within a range of wavelengths called the bragg regime , the light normally incident on the chiral stf is mostly reflected ; if the handedness of the helix is opposite , the reflection is little . in the time domain ,",
    "the circular bragg phenomenon is manifested as a pulse  bleeding phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "previous research has shown that chiral stfs can affect the shapes , durations , and energy content of ultrashort optical pulses depending on the circular polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave  @xcite .",
    "as the thickness of a chiral stf increases , the circular bragg phenomenon ripens : the reflection first increases and then saturates , and differences in shape and duration between incident and transmitted pulses arise  @xcite .",
    "ultrawideband pulsed plane waves , known as videopulses , ultranarrowband rectangular pulsed plane waves , and two  dimensional pulsed beams can therefore also be shaped by chiral stfs  @xcite .",
    "pre and post  resonance bragg regimes have also been elucidated  @xcite .",
    "so far , all research into the shaping of pulsed plane waves and pulsed beams by chiral stfs has been of a qualitative nature .",
    "the shapes of pulses reflected , refracted , transmitted , and diffracted by chiral stfs were predicted numerically , but measures of the extent of pulse shaping were not introduced .",
    "our purpose here is to apply three measures of the pulse duration  the equivalent , root mean square , and correlation durations  and three measures of the average speed of the pulse  the peak speed , the center  of  energy speed , and the correlation speed  to the shaping of pulsed plane waves of different total energies , carrier wavelengths , and carrier polarization states after transmission through linear and nonlinear chiral stfs .",
    "this work is important for four reasons .",
    "first , the measures of pulse shaping will allow direct comparisons between our theoretical conclusions and future experiments .",
    "second , quantification of pulse shaping by complex materials like stfs will facilitate the design of stfs to shape pulsed plane waves and pulsed beams in controlled ways .",
    "third , the algorithms we develop can be used to evaluate designs of stf  based devices ; and fourth , they advance the state of the art of the time  domain analysis of electromagnetic pulse propagation to include propagation in causal , inhomogeneous , anisotropic , and nonlinear materials .",
    "parenthetically , by virtue of mathematical isomorphism we expect our results to hold , in general , for cholesteric liquid crystals ( clcs ) too .",
    "we note that others have modeled optical propagation in noncausal nonlinear cholesteric liquid crystals ( clcs ) in the frequency domain  @xcite and with the slowly  varying envelope approximation  @xcite ; propagation in linear clcs has also been undertaken with the finite element method  @xcite .",
    "second harmonic generation in nonlinear chiral stfs was also studied previously in the frequency domain  @xcite .",
    "our work distinguishes itself from these earlier studies on account of its causal time ",
    "domain treatment of the propagation of pulsed plane waves through nonlinear chiral stfs without the invocation of the frequency domain or slowly varying envelope approximation .",
    "our report on the quantification of the shaping of pulsed plane waves by chiral stfs proceeds as follows .",
    "the constitutive relations of a chiral stf , along with a finite  difference scheme for calculating the propagation of pulsed plane waves through vacuum and chiral stfs , are presented in section  [ s : theory ] .",
    "measures of the durations and average speeds of pulsed plane waves are also introduced in section  [ s : theory ] .",
    "we discuss the main results of our work in section  [ s : results and discussion ] , and present the main scientific and technological conclusions in section  [ s : concluding remarks ] .",
    "this section describes the constitutive relations of spatially local , dielectric , structurally chiral stfs ; our choice of ultrashort optical pulses ; the numerical method we use to predict their propagation ; and three measures each of pulse duration and speed .",

    "when @xmath17 , the response is third  order nonlinear ; specifically , the material exhibits an intensity  dependent refractive index  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity is thus isotropic .",
    "whether linear or nonlinear , the chosen material does not respond instantaneously to the applied field .    the dielectric susceptibility dyadic @xmath18 contains the information about the nonhomogeneous , anisotropic , and temporally nonlocal properties of a chiral stf .",
    "suppose the chiral stf occupies the region @xmath19 .",
    "then the dielectric susceptibility dyadic , which is null  valued in the region @xmath20 , can be factored as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a rotation dyadic that describes the morphology of the chiral stf along the @xmath23 axis ( the axis of nonhomogeneity ) , and @xmath24 is a reference susceptibility dyadic that describes , in accord with causality , the time ",

    "we now turn to quantitative measures of pulse duration and average speed .",
    "our goal is to define measures that are useful for experimental research or theoretical insight or both . as the chosen pulses are highly broadband and suffer appreciable distortion , the usual concept of group velocity  @xcite is not meaningful for analysis except in frequency ",
    "domain arguments .",
    "more sophisticated measures were therefore devised .",
    "the pulse duration is an important parameter because it determines the time scale for measurements or manipulations made with the pulse ; pulses of shorter duration permit the measurement of events of shorter duration  @xcite . in order to define measures of pulse duration ,",
    "we considered the @xmath70 moment @xmath71 of a scalar function @xmath72 with respect to variable @xmath73 on the interval @xmath74 : @xmath75 the root mean square ( rms ) deviation @xmath76 from the centroid @xmath77 of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath73 on the interval @xmath74 is defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath78 both @xmath79 and @xmath76 are undefined when @xmath80 .",

    "another measure of the pulse duration , called the equivalent duration  @xcite , is @xmath87 computed at a particular @xmath82 over an interval @xmath81 , and divided by the peak value of @xmath88 over that interval , i.e. , @xmath89 where @xmath90 indicates the maximum value of a function over the chosen time interval .",
    "the correlation duration @xmath91 is defined by  @xcite @xmath92 we decided to use @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath91 as measures of pulse duration in this study .",
    "there are many measures of the pulse speed , including the group speed and the centrovelocity  @xcite .",
    "we calculated three measures of the speed of the pulse through the film : the average speed of the pulse s peak value of @xmath88 , the average speed of @xmath95 , and the average correlation velocity  @xcite .",
    "the energy density @xmath88 of the transmitted pulse was recorded over the interval @xmath81 at some location @xmath96 .",
    "then the time @xmath97 where the function @xmath98 indicates the time at which the maximum value of its argument occurs , the time @xmath99 and the time @xmath100 were found . from these data ,",
    "the average speeds @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 were calculated from the formula @xmath104 thus the speeds @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are the thickness of the chiral stf divided by the computed times @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , less the time over which the pulse traverses the vacuous regions @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we note that these measures are average speeds because they are in the form of a finite distance over a finite time interval , and hence do not reveal variations in the speed of the pulse as it enters , traverses , and exits the chiral stf . for the foregoing calculations , we approximated integrals with the rectangular rule  @xcite .",
    "the measures of pulse duration and average speed have different physical meanings and concomitant advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the equivalent duration @xmath93 is the duration a rectangular pulse would have , if it possessed the same peak value of @xmath88 and the same total energy per unit area as the pulse under consideration .",
    "its advantage lies with its simplicity ; however , it depends crucially on the correct determination of the peak value of @xmath88 .",
    "this same problem is a disadvantage of @xmath101 , which is the average speed of the peak of the pulse through the chiral stf .",
    "this measure of the speed can even become multi  valued if the peak value of @xmath88 occurs at more than one local maximum ( like the twin humps of a bactrian camel ) .",
    "the duration @xmath94 is the rms deviation of @xmath88 from its first moment , normalized to the total energy per unit area of the pulse .",
    "it is analogous to the concept of radius of gyration in mechanics .",
    "we call @xmath102 , the average speed of @xmath95 , the center  of  energy speed .",
    "it is analogous to the concept of the velocity of a body s center of mass in mechanics , and is closely related to the centrovelocity and a redefinition of the group velocity  @xcite . ] , as discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these measures is that they depend on @xmath88 over the whole pulse , and not just on the peak value of @xmath88 .",
    "however , it is possible for the center of energy to be located at a value of @xmath23 at which @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "the correlation duration @xmath91 is a measure of how tightly @xmath88 is concentrated in time .",
    "the correlation velocity @xmath103 is the average speed of the peak of the correlation of the incident pulse with the transmitted pulse . like @xmath101",
    ", it depends heavily on the shape of the transmitted pulse . in some cases",
    ", it could become a multi  valued function of @xmath82 and the chosen time interval @xmath81 .",
    "however , it does provide a way to track the propagation of energy in the pulse in a different way than @xmath102 , and it is fairly robust  @xcite .",
    "all six of the quantities we have defined in this subsection are amenable to experimental determination , for example by frequency  resolved optical gating ( frog )  @xcite . in our definitions of the measures ,",
    "we have chosen to use @xmath88 instead of @xmath111 , for example , because the former is a lorentz  invariant quantity .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the results of our calculations .",
    "the chiral stf we studied possesses the following constitutive parameters : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116  nm , @xmath117  nm , @xmath118  nm , and @xmath119 . the film is structurally right  handed , i.e. , @xmath120 , and we chose it to be either linear ( i.e. , @xmath121 ) or nonlinear ( @xmath122  m@xmath123/v@xmath123 ) , in accord with simple order  of  magnitude estimates  @xcite .",

    "the variable @xmath23 was discretized into intervals of @xmath126  nm , and the variable @xmath8 into intervals of @xmath127  fs . the center wavelength of the bragg regime of the linear chiral stf is approximately  @xmath128  nm , and its full  width half ",
    "maximum bandwidth is approximately  @xmath129  nm  @xcite , though we note that both these quantities may change slightly when the chiral stf is nonlinear  @xcite .",

    "domain plots help to explain our time  domain results .",
    "the spatiotemporal evolution of the incoming pulse was computed on the spatial domain @xmath144  @xmath1 m , of which the chiral stf occupies @xmath145  @xmath1 m .",
    "measures of pulse duration and speed were computed at @xmath146  @xmath1 m over the time interval @xmath147  fs .",
    "the wavelength @xmath57 of the carrier plane wave was set to either @xmath148 , @xmath149 , or @xmath150  nm ; and the polarization state of the carrier plane wave was chosen as either lcp or rcp . at visible wavelengths ,",
    "the selected linear constitutive properties yield refractive indexes that are commonplace in optics  @xcite .",
    "let us now examine the effects of the chiral stfs on pulses reflected from and transmitted through them .",
    "we are interested mainly in trends in the pulse shape , duration , and speed as the pulse energy per unit area , carrier wavelength and polarization state , and the nonlinearity of the chiral stf are varied , as opposed to particular values that the duration , etc . , may take on as those parameters are varied .",
    "the shapes of the incident pulses , as exemplified by snapshots of their energy density in figure  [ fig1 ] , are independent both of the carrier wavelength and carrier polarization state .",
    "the incident pulses traversed vacuum ( @xmath151  @xmath1 m ) , were scattered by the stf , and eventually became transmitted signals in the vacuous region @xmath152  @xmath1 m and reflected signals in the region @xmath151",
    "@xmath1 m .",
    "let us begin with case  l. both transmitted and reflected pulses are captured in the snapshots of @xmath153 at time @xmath154  fs in figure  [ fig2 ] , where an important trend can be perceived .",
    "irrespective of the polarization state of the carrier plane wave , the peak energy density of the transmitted pulse increases with increasing carrier wavelength .",
    "that is , the peak value of @xmath153 , @xmath155 , is greater when @xmath156  nm than when @xmath157 or @xmath148  nm for a given carrier polarization state .",
    "this trend applies in reverse to the lengths ( i.e. , @xmath23extents ) of the transmitted pulses : the transmitted pulses are longer when @xmath57 takes on lower values .",
    "the effects of structural handedness are most evident in the plots of the reflected pulses shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , which contains plots of @xmath153 as a function of time at @xmath158  @xmath1 m .",
    "the incident pulse is either lcp or rcp , and @xmath159 , @xmath149 , or @xmath150  nm . the energy densities of the reflected pulses ( which begin at @xmath160  fs ) are much smaller than those of the incident pulses",
    ".    the effects of the circular bragg phenomenon are evident in figure  [ fig3 ] . in the bottom row of plots , for which the conditions for the circular bragg phenomenon are satisfied  @xcite , the primary reflected pulse possesses both a larger head and longer tail _ than _ when the incident carrier plane wave is lcp ( top row of plots ) .",
    "the longer tail is due to the bleeding of energy from the refracted pulse inside the film to the reflected pulse  @xcite , and it is most pronounced when @xmath157  nm , i.e. when the carrier wavelength lies in the bragg regime .",
    "a secondary pulse appears in all six cases beginning at @xmath161  fs .",
    "this smaller pulse is the result of the reflection from the chiral stf / vacuum interface at @xmath162 .",
    "when the incident light is rcp , @xmath153 at @xmath163 oscillates rapidly in both the head of the primary pulse and the secondary pulse , a phenomenon that is due to interference between lcp and rcp components of the reflected light  @xcite .",
    "the tail of the primary reflected pulse does not exhibit such large oscillations because a superposition of lcp and rcp light of substantially the same energy densities is needed to create them  @xcite .",
    "the lcp component of the reflected pulse is of short duration , on the order of the duration of the incident pulse .",
    "the pulse  bleeding effect only operates on the fraction of incident light in the bragg regime that is rcp , and so the tail of the primary reflected pulse contains mostly rcp light but little to no lcp light when the circular bragg phenomenon occurs .",
    "corresponding plots for the nonlinear cases n1 and n2 are shown in figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] , respectively .",
    "while still small compared to the incident pulses , the peak values of @xmath153 in the heads of the primary reflected pulses increase from figures  [ fig3 ] to  [ fig5 ] for given carrier wavelength and polarization state .",
    "this is due to the increasing effects of nonlinearity in case  n1 as compared to case  l , and in case  n2 as compared to case  n1 .",
    "an understanding emerges from the frequency domain  @xcite as follows : for the type of nonlinearity we studied , a greater value of @xmath69 creates a greater refractive  index mismatch between vacuum and the chiral stf because of the multiplicative character of the nonlinearity in  ( [ e : causal response ] )  @xcite .",
    "the refractive index of vacuum is unity , and we can see from figure  [ figa ] that the real parts of @xmath164 and @xmath165 are decreasing functions of carrier wavelength at carrier wavelengths greater than 300  nm .",
    "when the chiral stf is nonlinear , the differences between the refractive indexes of the chiral stf and unity shall become even greater , and those differences will be greatest when the intensity of the beam is highest . hence , the reflection at the pulse head is greater than otherwise .",
    "the peak values of @xmath153 in the secondary pulses are not appreciably different from case  l to case  n1 to case  n2 ( at least when normalized by the value of @xmath69 , as was done for all the figures ) .",
    "evidently , absorption by the chiral stf reduces the peak energy density of the primary refracted pulse in case  n2 to a greater degree than in case  n1 and in case  n1 to a greater degree than in case  l  @xcite . in the frequency domain ,",
    "absorption manifests itself through positive values of @xmath166 and @xmath167 , as seen in figure  [ figa ] . by the time the primary refracted pulses reach @xmath168 ,",
    "their energy densities drop such that the refractive  index mismatch between vacuum and chiral stf across @xmath162 is reduced between cases  l , n1 , and n2 .",
    "differences in energy density that remained were further reduced on the return trip of the secondary pulse from @xmath162 to @xmath169 .",
    "figures  [ fig6 ] to  [ fig8 ] contain plots of @xmath153 as functions of time recorded at @xmath170  @xmath1 m ; these are the transmitted pulses for cases l , n1 , and n2 , respectively .",
    "the peak values of @xmath153 increase , for given carrier polarization state , as @xmath57 increases , an effect that is attributable to the presence of the absorption resonances at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the frequency domain behavior of the absorption resonances is shown in plots of @xmath166 and @xmath167 in figure  [ figa ] .",
    "other parameters being equal , more of the bandwidth of a pulse with lower @xmath57 overlaps the bandwidth of the absorption resonances of the chiral stf than the bandwidth of a pulse with higher @xmath57 , and hence more absorption occurs in the former case . for given @xmath57 and carrier polarization state , the peak values of @xmath153again normalized to @xmath69drop from figures  [ fig6 ] to  [ fig8 ] .",
    "notice that when the incident carrier plane wave is rcp , but not lcp , the transmitted pulses tend to have a lobed or humped structure , and that the number and sizes of the lobes increase from case l to case n1 to case n2 .",
    "thus , the presence of the chosen nonlinearity distorts the shapes of the transmitted pulses and tends to make them highly asymmetric , but the effect is prominent only when the structural handedness of the film matches the sense of the circular polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave .",
    "what effects does a change in carrier wavelength have on the durations of pulses transmitted through a chiral stf ?",
    "quantification of the effects of the carrier wavelength , carrier polarization state , and the nonlinearity of the chiral stf on @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath91 is provided through figure  [ fig9 ] , wherein plots of those quantities for thirteen values of @xmath57 ranging from  395 to  635  nm are shown .",
    "the incident carrier plane wave is again either lcp or rcp , and cases l , n1 , and n2 are again considered .",
    "the overall trend in the plots is a decrease in pulse duration with increasing carrier wavelength .",
    "as the carrier wavelength decreases , the material exhibits greater dispersion due to proximity to the absorption resonances .",
    "the transmitted pulse is consequently of longer duration , because light of longer free  space wavelength has both greater phase and group velocities in the chiral stf than light of shorter @xmath137 , as can be seen in figure  [ figb ] .",
    "this is because @xmath138 and @xmath139 drop with increasing @xmath137 above the resonance wavelengths @xmath171 , as can be seen in figure  [ figa ] .",
    "therefore the chosen pulses , which do not possess any negative chirp in their carrier wavelengths , tend to spread out as they propagate through the chiral stf .",
    "although that is the overall trend , there is an exception : there appears to be a local maximum for @xmath94 when @xmath172  nm and the incident carrier plane wave is rcp .",
    "we believe that this effect is due to the circular bragg phenomenon , because the local maximum appears in the vicinity of the center wavelength of the bragg regime , and it does not appear when the incident carrier plane wave is lcp . additionally , for the same @xmath57 and carrier polarization state , the duration of the pulses tends to increase from case  l to case  n1 to case  n2 .",
    "plots of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 in figure  [ fig10 ] show that they all tend to increase with increasing carrier wavelength , but decrease slightly with increasing nonlinearity .",
    "these two trends are due to the presence of the absorption resonances in the ultraviolet regime , and the tendency of the nonlinearities to enhance those resonances . as is clear from figure  [ figa ] , the principal refractive indexes of the chiral stf are higher for wavelengths closer to the resonances , and hence pulsed plane waves with lower @xmath57 are slowed more by the film than pulsed plane waves with higher @xmath57 , as can be seen in figure  [ figb ] .",
    "the presence of nonlinearity increases the refractive indexes because of its multiplicative nature in  ( [ e : causal response ] ) , and hence pulsed plane waves with higher @xmath69 are slowed more than pulsed plane waves with lower @xmath69 when propagating through a chiral stf .",
    "both @xmath101 and @xmath103 are heavily affected by pulse shaping by the chiral stf which is manifested as the alteration of the peaks of the transmitted pulses .",
    "for example , notice the jumps in these quantities that occur between @xmath173  nm and @xmath174  nm for cases  n1 and  n2 when the incident carrier plane wave is rcp .",
    "the jumps occur due to the appearance of the lobed structure of the transmitted pulses mentioned in section  [ s : reflected and transmitted pulses ] ; and , in the case of @xmath103 , also due to the the short duration of the incident pulse as compared to the transmitted one .",
    "the calculations of @xmath101 and @xmath103 require finding the peak value of either @xmath88 or of its correlation with the @xmath175 ; and so , if one lobe suddenly becomes larger than another , the peak of the transmitted pulse has to shift .",
    "this shift creates a jump in both @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "pulse shaping is to be expected to be particularly prominent when pulses of high peak powers pass through nonlinear chiral stfs , because the effects of nonlinearity are going to be very pronounced then .",
    "as a result of our calculations , we offer the following conclusions that may be useful to future designers of optical pulse shapers fabricated with chiral stfs .",
    "* increased nonlinearity reshapes pulses more  as is evident in the increased formation of a lobed structure  when the carrier polarization state of the incident pulse has the same sense as the structural handedness of the chiral stf .",
    "attenuation of the transmitted pulse increases when the carrier wavelength lies closer to the absorption resonances , which is also confirmed by frequency ",
    "domain results  @xcite . * for specified carrier polarization state , @xmath69 , and @xmath176 , the durations @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath91 all tend to increase with decreasing @xmath57except for @xmath94 in the case of a linear chiral stf under conditions in which the circular bragg phenomenon is exhibited .",
    "therefore a chiral  stf  based device could change the durations of pulses , contingent on the polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave . * for specified @xmath57 and polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave , the transmitted pulse duration tends to increase with increasing nonlinear effects .",
    "therefore , any pulse  shaping device based on nonlinear chiral stfs can only be expected to work over a certain range of incident pulse intensities . * for a given carrier polarization state , @xmath69 , and @xmath176 , the speed @xmath102 tends to increase with increasing @xmath57 . therefore chiral stfs can function as wavelength  selective delay elements for ultrashort optical pulses . * for specified @xmath57 and polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave ,",
    "the speeds @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 tend to decrease with increasing nonlinear effects .    to conclude ,",
    "let us note that our presented technique can accommodate other types of nonlinearities  specifically , nonlinearities that are not simply multiplicative but must be incorporated through multiple convolutions , which appear necessary for modelling the nonlinear response of dielectrics to attosecond pulses  @xcite .",
    "however , the computational capabilities then required will be significantly greater than the ones commonly available today .",
