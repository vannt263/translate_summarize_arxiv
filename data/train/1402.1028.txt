    "@xmath5 denotes the spin density of the conduction electrons at distance @xmath6 from the impurity after switching on the kondo coupling at time @xmath3 .",
    "since the spins are initially uncorrelated , this correlation function vanishes for @xmath7 and is a measure of the building up of the spatial entanglement between the local spin and the conduction - electron spin density .    for",
    "infinitely long times , the equilibrium spatial correlation function of the kondo model must be recovered .",
    "this correlation function @xmath8 has been investigated intensively by affleck and collaborators @xcite using field theoretical methods in the last 15 years .",
    "it accounts for alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations as expected by spin - correlations mediated by the rkky mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the crossover between different power - law decays for short and long distances , found @xcite in @xmath9 , occurs at a characteristic length scale @xmath10 , which has been interpreted as the size of the kondo screening cloud @xcite , where @xmath11 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath12 the kondo temperature governing the crossover from a free impurity spin at high temperatures to the singlet formation for @xmath13 .",
    "the modulus of equilibrium correlation function @xmath9 has also been investigated using a real - space dmrg @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two limits , @xmath3 and @xmath14 , are known and used as reference points for our calculations .",
    "the time - dependent spin - correlation function @xmath15 contains the information about how the spin correlations propagate through the system .",
    "we have found for an antiferromagnetic kondo coupling ( i ) ferromagnetic correlations propagating away from the impurity with the fermi - velocity @xmath11 , which defines the `` light cone '' @xcite of the problem , and ( ii ) in addition finite and nonexponential small correlations outside of this light cone .",
    "we have been able ( iii ) to trace back the correlations outside of the light cone to the intrinsic entanglement of the fermi sea using a controlled second - order expansion in the kondo coupling constant and comparing the perturbative results with the full td - nrg simulation . since @xmath15 is not a response function ,",
    "correlations outside of the light cone are allowed .",
    "any response function , however , describing the transmission of signals vanishes outside of the light cone in accordance with relativity if the momentum cutoff , is sent to infinity @xcite . for a finite momentum cutoff",
    "this statement is weaken to fast decay on a length scale set by the inverse momentum cutoff . at @xmath16 , an algebraic decay is found in accordance with a broadened @xmath17-distribution function .",

    "@xcite but also considerably extent their work : we include the full spatial dependence that allows us to access the full @xmath18 oscillations inherent to the rkky mediated correlations .",
    "furthermore , the crossover between short and long distances , i.  e. ,  @xmath19 and @xmath20 , including the kondo physics at low temperature in the strong coupling regime is fully accessible by the nrg , which can not be revealed by perturbative approaches .",
    "borda has pioneered the calculation of equilibrium spatial correlation function for the kondo model using the nrg @xcite .",

    ", the spatial information @xcite is encoded in the energy dependent density of states ( dos ) of the even and odd bands . since a single two - band nrg run",
    "is required for each distance @xmath23 , the numerical calculations are very involved and require an independent nrg calculation with individually adapted bands for each distance @xmath23 .",

    "our modifications are able ( i ) to accurately reproduce the analytically known sum rules @xcite for the spin - correlation function in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic kondo regimes , ( ii ) reproduce the analytical spin - spin correlation function of the decoupled fermi sea exactly , and ( iii ) obtain sign changes @xmath9 at short and intermediate distances expected from rkky mediated correlations .",
    "while borda reported @xcite that @xmath9 remains negative for all distances and kondo couplings as can be seen in fig .  2 of ref .  , we find oscillating and power - law decaying @xmath24 only for distances @xmath20 in accordance with previous analytic predictions using a 1d field theoretical approach @xcite . at short distances ,",
    "the kondo screening is incomplete and , therefore , alternating signs are found in @xmath9 .",
    "we also discuss the spectral functions of the retarded spin - spin susceptibility as a function of @xmath23 and use these results to calculate the linear response of the host spin density at a distance @xmath23 to a local magnetic field applied on the impurity spin at the origin . here , the response outside of the light cone is suppressed .",
