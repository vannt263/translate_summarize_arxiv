    ", one can see an initial linear growth phase and a wave collapse at @xmath629 , in which almost all the cpem wave energy is contracted into a few well separated localized cpem wave pipes .",
    "these are characterized by a large bell - shaped amplitude of the cpem wave , an almost complete depletion of the electron number density at the center of the cpem wavepacket , and a large - amplitude positive electrostatic potential . comparing fig .",

    "in this paper , we have presented our up - to - date theoretical knowledge of nonlinear physics of non - relativistic quantum plasmas .",
    "we started with nonlinear quantum models that describe the physics of localized excitations in different areas of physics .",
    "we then moved to discussing the well known electron and ion plasma wave spectra in dense quantum plasmas , and presented nonlinear models for treating nonlinear interactions among finite amplitude plasma waves at nanoscales .",
    "as examples , we demonstrated the existence of localized nonlinear epos and localized ion waves in dense quantum plasmas .",
    "for electrostatic epos , the electron dynamics is governed by a pair composed of nonlinear schrdinger and poisson ( nlsp ) equations .",
    "we stress that the nonlinear schrdinger equation governing the spatio - temporal evolution of the electron wave function in the presence of self - consistent electrostatic potential in dense plasmas has been obtained from the quantum electron momentum equation by introducing the eikonal representation as a mathematical tool for understanding the complex electron plasma wave interactions at nanoscales .",
    "such a description also appears in the context of the nonlinear electron dynamics in thin metal films @xcite .",
    "our nlsp equations admit a set of conserved quantities , e.g. the total number of electrons , the electron momentum , the electron angular momentum , and the electron energy . we have found that the nlsp equations admit quasi - stationary , localized structures in the form of one - dimensional quantized dark solitons and two - dimensional quantized vortices .",
    "these nanostructures are associated with a local depletion of the electron density associated with positive electrostatic potential , and are parameterised by the quantum coupling parameter only . in the two - dimensional geometry ,",
    "there exist a class of vortices of different excited states ( charge states ) associated with a complete depletion of the electron density and an associated positive potential .",
    "numerical simulations of the time - dependent nlsp equations demonstrate the stability of stable dark solitons in one space dimension with an amplitude consistent with the one found from the time - independent solutions . in two - space - dimensions ,",
    "the dark solitons of the first excited state were found to be stable and the preferred nonlinear state was in the form of vortex pairs of different polarities .",
    "one - dimensional dark solitons and singly charge two - dimensional vortices are thus long - lived nonlinear structures in quantum plasmas .",
    "similar to the bernstein - green - kruskal modes @xcite , we accounted for the trapping of electrons in the electrostatic wave potential and studied numerically the deformation of the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function and the subsequent emergence of localized phase space kinetic structures .",
    "such an investigation was carried out by using the time - dependent wigner and poisson equations .",
    "furthermore , we presented two mechanisms for the generation of magnetic fields in quantum plasmas .",
    "they are associated with the quantum weibel instability in the presence of equilibrium anisotropic fermi - dirac electron distribution function , as well as with the the non - stationary ponderomotive force of a large amplitude electromagnetic waves in quantum plasmas with streaming electrons .",
    "spontaneously generated magnetic fields can affect the linear and nonlinear propagation of both the electrostatic and electromagnetic waves in quantum magnetoplasmas @xcite .",
    "the quantum corrections produce dispersion at short scales for the electrostatic upper - hybrid , lower - hybrid , and ion - cyclotron waves , while the quantum bohm force and the electron@xmath630 spin effects introduce new features to the elliptically polarized extraordinary electromagnetic mode @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electron-@xmath631 spin is responsible for a new perpendicularly propagating ( with respect to the magnetic field direction ) electromagnetic spin wave , which can be excited by intense neutrino bursts in supernovae .",
    "the newly derived nonlinear emhd and hall - mhd equations can be used for investigating the multi - dimensional linear and nonlinear electromagnetic waves in quantum plasmas .",
    "finally , we have also presented theoretical and numerical studies of stimulated raman and brillouin scattering instabilities of a large amplitude electromagnetic wave , and the trapping of arbitrary large amplitude circularly polarized em waves in a fully nonlinear electron density hole in an unmagnetized quantum plasma .",
    "it is expected that localized nanostructures can transport electromagnetic wave energy over nanoscales in laboratory and astrophysical dense plasmas with degenerate electrons .    the field of the nonlinear quantum plasma physics is extremely rich and vibrant today , and it holds a great promise of providing new practical technologies .",
    "for example , the plasma assisted carbon nanostructures and nanomaterials are the future of nanotechnologies , so are the new radiation sources in the x - rays and gamma - rays regimes . in such circumstances",
    ", one should have a complete understanding of the fundamentals of collective nonlinear interactions ( e.g. intense high - order harmonic generation of ultrashort laser pulses from laser - irradiated dense plasma surfaces ) in quantum plasmas .",
    "furthermore , in magnetars , and in the next generation intense laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments , one would certainly have degenerate positrons , besides degenerate electrons .",
    "the physics of dense quantum magnetoplasmas with degenerate electron - positron pairs is expected to be quite different than what has been described in this paper .",
    "the reason is the complex nonlinear dynamics of the electron - positron pairs , which would have relativistic velocities in a dense magnetoplasma .",
    "accordingly , we should develop new theories involving relativistic kinetic and quantum relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations that include quantum relativistic effects @xcite , electromagnetic forces , angular momentum spin and nonlinear effects on equal footings .",
    "a detailed analysis of such theories would provide us a guide line for understanding the origin of localized high - energy radiation and other complex phenomena ( e.g. the formation of structures ) from astrophysical settings and future laboratory experiments aiming to model astrophysical scenarios .",
