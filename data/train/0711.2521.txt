    "the expansion history and curvature of the universe can be geometrically measured by galaxy clustering in redshift space @xcite , and the bao signature in the large - scale structure yields a standard ruler @xcite for this purpose .",
    "therefore , accurately measuring the bao scales in a statistical quantity such as the power spectrum or correlation function of galaxies , one can constrain the structure of the universe , such as the nature of dark energy @xcite .    to utilize the baos as a standard ruler in the universe ,",
    "a theoretically precise description of the baos is of the utmost importance .",
    "the physics of the baos at sufficiently large redshift is well described by linear theory .",
    "only the amplitude of the spatial pattern of clustering is increased , and the characteristic scale of the baos is unaltered in this regime",
    ". however , the nonlinear dynamics play an important role in a redshift range where we can measure the large - scale structure . even though the bao scales @xmath0 are large , the nonlinearity deforms the bao pattern in the power spectrum and correlation function @xcite .",
    "nonlinear deformations of the power spectrum are described by the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) @xcite of higher orders as long as the density fluctuations on bao scales are still in the linear regime at sufficiently large redshift @xcite .",
    "the last condition is not necessarily satisfied by realistic surveys .",
    "moreover , when the cold dark matter ( cdm ) is present , the higher - order spt does not give any sensible prediction for the correlation function because unphysical behavior in small wavelength limit prevents fourier transform from converging .",
    "recently , several other approaches beyond the framework of spt have been proposed @xcite . among others ,",
    "scoccimarro s reformulation of fluid equations using the propagator , the vertex , and a source @xcite provides a way to use standard tools of field theory , yielding the renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) @xcite , the large-@xmath1 expansions @xcite , the renormalization group approach @xcite , and the closure theory @xcite in the context of gravitational instability theory . in these newly developed approaches ,",
    "the standard perturbative expansion is reorganized and partially resummed in various ways .",
    "it is still difficult to exactly calculate the power spectrum by these approaches , and different levels of approximations and ansatz are employed .",
    "the predictions of the power spectrum calculated by the 2-loop rpt and renormalization group method are shown to agree with measurements of the @xmath1-body simulations on bao scales even at low redshift where the 1-loop spt breaks down @xcite .",
    "it is still nontrivial why these approaches work well despite their approximate treatments and use of ansatz .",
    "so far the predictions of the above nonlinear theories , such as spt , rpt , and their variants , have been confined in real space . since the large - scale structure is actually measured in redshift space , it is mandatory to make predictions in redshift space for applying the nonlinear theories to realworld observations .",
    "the redshift - space distortion effects in the linear regime are analytically given by first - order spt ( i.e. , linear theory ) @xcite .",
    "however , investigations of nonlinear redshift - space distortions by higher - order spt are quite limited in literature @xcite , apart from numerical simulations and nonlinear modelings @xcite .    in this paper",

    "there are a number of reasons .",
    "first , our approach is simpler than other resummation methods . while it is straightforward to calculate the power spectrum in our approach , other resummation techniques are so complicated that approximate treatments and/or ansatz are necessary in deriving the final power spectrum .",
    "second , as a result of that , our analytic expression of the resulting power spectrum is no more complicated than the spt expression , and numerical evaluations are fast performed .",
    "third , and most importantly , our approach is capable of evaluating the nonlinear power spectrum _ in redshift space _",
    ", which is beyond the scope of other resummation methods in literature .",
    "fourth , unlike in spt , the power spectrum in our approach can be fourier transformed to predict the nonlinear effects in the correlation function .",
    "an important ingredient of our approach is the perturbation theory in lagrangian space , which is known as the lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) @xcite .",
    "the first - order lpt corresponds to the classic zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "since the observable power spectrum is given in eulerian space , predicting the power spectrum by lpt is not a trivial task .",
    "we define a method of calculating the power spectrum from the lpt , partially expanding the lagrangian variables in eulerian space .",
