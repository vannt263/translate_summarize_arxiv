    "because of important dynamically - induced structural changes , the first few @xmath0yr represent the most critical period in a star cluster s life , especially for the low - mass embedded clusters ( ecs ) . at this stage ,",
    "cluster dissolution is essentially related to the impulsive parental gas removal by supernovae and massive star winds . following the rapid change in the gravitational potential - and the reduced escape velocity - an important fraction of the stars , even all stars , escape to the field .",
    "this process has been shown capable of dissolving most of the very young star clusters on a time - scale of @xmath1myr ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that , because of gas and dust ejection , young clusters with most of the stars still in the pms are not necessarily ecs .",
    "examples might be bochum1 ( @xcite ) , pismis5 ( @xcite ) , and ngc4755 ( @xcite ) .",
    "current estimates ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that less than @xmath2 of the galactic ecs dynamically evolve into gravitationally bound open clusters ( ocs ) .",
    "thus , such a massive early dissolution of ecs may be an important source of galactic field stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is in this context that a robust determination of fundamental parameters ( e.g. age , distance , mass , reddening , etc ) of young star clusters is important .",
    "however , several factors severely challenge this task , most of which are related to the conspicuous presence of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars in colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of young , low - mass star clusters . evolving towards",
    "the under - populated ms , the pms stars are usually shrouded within a non - uniform dust distribution , which may lead to a high degree of differential reddening .",
    "examples of clusters characterised by such cmds are ngc6611 , ngc4755 , ngc2244 , bochum1 , pismis5 , ngc1931 , vdb80 , cr197 and vdb92 ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein )",
    ". this effect is particularly critical for the very young clusters that are still in the ( gas and dust ) embedded phase . as an additional complicating factor , star formation within a cluster",
    "is not characterised by a single event . instead",
    ", stars in young clusters are observed to form over a significant time spread ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) , usually comparable to the cluster age . in summary ,",
    "cmds of clusters younger than @xmath3myr are expected to contain stars with a range of ages ( @xmath4 ) and affected by varying degrees of differential reddening . and",
    ", since most of the stellar mass of a young cluster is stored in the pms , the combined effect of the age spread and differential reddening complicates the straightforward derivation of cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "this is especially true when photometry is the only available information on a cluster .",
    "given the relevance of the above issues , it s natural that previous approaches with different sophistication degrees have been developed , exploring similar lines as in the present paper .",
    "for instance , @xcite present a powerful and formally elegant maximum - likelihood method to derive distances and ages of young clusters through comprehensive hess diagram simulations .",
    "although allowing for the presence of binaries in an isochronal population , their method does not include age spread or differential reddening . also , it appears to apply more consistently to clusters with cmds satisfactorily described by a single isochrone , i.e. , those without a significant pms age spread ( usually older than @xmath5myr ) .",
    "later , @xcite improves on the @xcite method by including differential reddening , age spreads and pms stars in the simulations .",
    "however , distance and reddening are not free parameters in @xcite ; instead , they are adopted from previously estimated values .",
    "@xcite presents another attempt to modelling cmds of young star clusters by means of varying star formation histories .",
    "based on confusion between signal and noise in cmds , they conclude that there is only marginal evidence for moderate age spreads in recent star forming regions and young open clusters .",
    "more recently , @xcite apply a monte carlo method to the age determination of embedded clusters through near - infrared ( ukidss ) photometry .",
    "they deredden the photometry of a real cluster and compare it with models built from theoretical isochrones .    in this work",
    "we simulate some relevant conditions that usually apply to the early cluster phases to approach the problem of obtaining reliable fundamental parameters of pms - rich clusters affected by varying degrees of differential reddening .",
    "we adopt a simplistic approach , keeping the number of assumptions - and free parameters - to a minimum . in short ,",
    "we start by building a distribution of artificial stars ( i.e. with mass and absolute luminosity ) corresponding to clusters of a range of masses and ages .",
    "next , we apply a set of values of foreground reddening , distance modulus and differential reddening to the model stars , and build the corresponding hess diagram .",
    "photometric uncertainties and their smearing effect on cmds are explicitly taken into account . at each step",
    "we compare the artificial and observed hess diagrams , searching for the set of values that produce the best match .",
    "binaries - in varying fractions - are also included in the simulated hess diagrams .",
    "formally , our _ brute - force _ approach is not as elegant as some of the previous methods ( see above ) .",
    "however , it has the advantage of fully exploring the parameter space in the search for the best set of values , although at the cost of heavy computer time when working with fine grids ( sect .",
    "[ test ] ) .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ ycs ] we discuss the relevant effects that affect the cmds and describe the approach . in sect .",
    "[ conexp ] we apply the approach to some control cases and discuss the results in terms of the residual statistics . in sect .",
    "[ tcadf ] we do the same with two previously studied young clusters . concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "for consistency with previous work by our group on young clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , we consider here photometric properties ( e.g. the relationship between errors with apparent magnitude , quality control , cmds ) that usually apply to 2mass . the all - sky coverage and uniformity of 2mass , associated with a moderate near - infrared photometric depth ,",
    "provide an adequate environment for probing properties even of deeply embedded clusters ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for similar reasons , we work with @xmath6 cmds ( this colour is the least affected by photometric errors and the best discriminant for pms stars - e.g. @xcite ) and the corresponding hess diagrams . thus , in what follows we refer to the apparent distance modulus as , foreground reddening as , and differential reddening as .",
    "reddening transformations are based on the absorption relations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photometric uncertainties - which are assumed to be normally distributed - are taken into account when building the hess diagrams .",
    "formally , if the magnitude ( or colour ) of a given star is given by @xmath10 , the probability of finding it at a specific value @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "thus , for each star we compute the fraction of the magnitude and colour that occurs in a given bin of a hess diagram , which corresponds to the difference of the error functions computed at the bin borders . by definition , summing the colour and magnitude density over all hess bins results in the number of input stars . as a compromise between cmd resolution and computational time , the hess diagrams used in this work consist of magnitude and colour bins of size @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "binary systems are expected to survive the early evolutionary phase of low - mass clusters , with the unresolved pairs being somewhat brighter than the single stars and producing some broadening of the cmd stellar sequences ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , binaries also produce changes on the initial mass function of young , massive star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we also include them in our simulations by means of the parameter , which measures the fraction of unresolved binaries in a cmd . according to this definition , a cmd having @xmath15 detections , but characterised by the binary fraction , would have a number of individual stars expressed as @xmath16 .",
    "for consistency with our assumption of continuous star formation ( sect .",
    "[ test ] ) , binaries are formed by pairing stars with the closest ages , regardless of the individual masses .",
    "this gives rise to a secondary to primary star mass - ratio ( @xmath17 ) that smoothly increases from very - low values up to @xmath18 , and decreases for higher values of @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) .",
    "most of the difficulties associated with obtaining reliable fundamental parameters for young clusters are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which we present a template cmd corresponding to a 250  cluster with an age of 20myr , and no foreground reddening . for the stellar mass / luminosity relation we use the solar - metallicity isochrone sets of padova ( @xcite )",
    "isochrones and @xcite .",
    "both isochrone sets have been merged for each age considered , since padova isochrones should be used only for the ms ( or more evolved sequences ) , while those of siess apply to the pms .",
    "the merging point occurs at the ms , at @xmath20 for the isochrones younger than 8myr , @xmath21 for 10myr , @xmath22 for 20myr , and @xmath23 for 30myr .",
    "the models are built with stars with mass @xmath24 , the lowest mass considered in the pms isochrones .",
    "first we consider zero distance modulus and no differential reddening . at this point",
    "the template stars are relatively bright and simply distribute among the isochrones according to the age and mass , with very small photometric uncertainties .",
    "when the template stars are displaced by e.g. @xmath25 ( still with no differential reddening ) , a significant scatter shows up , increasing for fainter stars .",
    "finally , when a moderate value of differential reddening ( @xmath26 ) is added to the template , the scatter tends to mask any relationship between stars and isochrones , even for @xmath27 .",
    "clearly , this effect increases with distance modulus . at each step",
    "we also show the stellar sequences corresponding to the maximum possible binary fraction , @xmath28 . while the mild brightening implied by the binaries with respect to the single stars ( sect .",
    "[ tcadf ] ) is clearly seen in all cases , the broadening ends up drowned both by the intrinsic pms age spread and photometric errors .",
    "thus , the binary - related broadening should be more noticeable in the ms of massive clusters of any age .",
    "note that , as a photometric quality control , we have kept only the stars with  and  errors lower than 0.5 .",
    "such a loose constraint is used here only for illustrative purposes . in what follows we work only stars with errors lower than 0.2 .",
    "the error restriction is used to somehow emulate the photometric completeness function of the observations .",
    "we illustrate this effect on the luminosity function of an artificial cluster containing an arbitrarily large number of stars , for statistical purposes ( fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) . after following the steps described below for assigning magnitudes and uncertainties , we applied the restriction of keeping only stars with @xmath29 and 0.2 .",
    "compared to the _ complete _ luminosity function , which presents a turnover at @xmath30 , the restricted functions have turnovers that smoothly shift towards brighter magnitudes .",
    "briefly put , we start by building the hess diagram corresponding to the @xmath6 cmd of a young cluster . then we search - by means of _ brute force _ - for the set of values of cluster stellar mass ( ) , age ( ) , differential reddening ( ) , foreground reddening ( ) , and apparent distance modulus ( ) , that produces the best match between the observed and simulated hess diagrams .",
    "note that , to minimise the number of free parameters , we assume a uniform ( or flat ) distribution for the differential reddening .",
    "alternative shapes might be tested , such as a normal distribution around a mean value .",
    "however , this would require an additional parameter ( the standard deviation ) , and cmds of young clusters might lack constraints to find the _",
    "best values _ for a large number of free parameters . also , we assume that for a cluster of age  and mass , stars ( of mass @xmath31 ) form continuously between @xmath32 . in this context",
    ", the cluster age also characterises the star - formation time spread , since we assume the cluster age to coincide with the beginning of the star formation . as a caveat",
    "we note that assuming a flat age distribution may be somewhat unrealistic , especially for clusters older than @xmath33myr , since this would imply a very slow and steady star formation rate .",
    "however , except for the artificial clusters used as control tests below , in this paper we apply our approach to clusters younger than this threshold .",
    "the approach takes on the following steps : _",
    "( i ) _ start with an artificial cluster of mass , age , apparent distance modulus , and foreground reddening . _ ( ii ) _ select the stellar masses by randomly taking values from @xcite mass function , until the individual mass sum yields . _",
    "( iii ) _ randomly assign each star an age @xmath4 . _ ( iv ) _ as another simplifying assumption , consider that each star can be randomly absorbed by any value of ( differential ) reddening in the range @xmath34 .",
    "_ ( v ) _ apply shifts in colour and magnitude according to the values of  and . _",
    "( vi ) _ assign each artificial star a photometric uncertainty based on the average 2mass errors and magnitude relationship . _ ( vii ) _ for more realistic representativeness , add some photometric noise to the stars .",
    "this step is done to minimise the probability of stars with the same mass having exactly the same _ observed _ magnitude , colour , and uncertainty in the cmd .",
    "consider a star ( of mass @xmath31 and age ) with an intrinsic ( i.e. , measured from the corresponding isochrone ) magnitude @xmath35 and assigned uncertainty @xmath36 .",
    "the noise - added magnitude @xmath37 is then randomly computed from a normal distribution with a mean @xmath35 and standard deviation @xmath36 . _",
    "( viii ) _ apply the same detection limit to the model cmd as for the observations , so that model and data share a similar photometric completeness function ; in practice , this means that stars with photometric errors higher than 0.2 are discarded . _",
    "( ix ) _ build the corresponding @xmath6 hess diagram , compare it with the observed one and compute the root mean squared residual 2  ( see below ) for this set of values . _",
    "( x ) _ repeat steps _",
    "( i ) _ - _ ( x ) _ for a range of values of , , , , and .",
    "finally , analyse the topology of the hyperspace defined by @xmath38 and search for solutions around the minimum values of 2 .",

    "the relation of errors with magnitude for 2mass is well represented by @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as for the photometric noise for a star with magnitude @xmath46 , a new magnitude is randomly taken from the normal distribution characterised by the mean @xmath37 and standard deviation @xmath36 .",
    "with respect to the root mean squared residual between observed ( @xmath47 ) and simulated ( @xmath48 ) hess diagrams composed of @xmath49 and @xmath50 colour and magnitude bins , we define    @xmath51 ^ 2 } { n_c\\times",

    "( i ) _ we build @xmath52 clusters of mass  and age . to improve the statistical significance , the final simulations , in most cases ,",
    "are run with @xmath53 . in this sense ,",
    "the artificial hess diagram ( step _ ( ix ) _ ) corresponds to the average density over the @xmath52 clusters .    for practical reasons ,",
    "the age grid is restricted to = 0.2 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 20 and 30myr . indeed , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , a finer age grid would be redundant .",
    "the stellar mass / luminosity relation is taken from the respective merged set of solar - metallicity padova and siess isochrones .",
    "magnitudes for stars with intermediate age values are obtained by interpolation among the neighbouring isochrones . according to the adopted isochrone sets , the minimum stellar mass is 0.1 , while the maximum ranges from 60  ( at 0.2myr ) , 36  ( 5myr ) , 19  ( 10myr ) , and 9  ( 30myr ) .",
    "as described above , the _ brute - force _ nature of our approach tends to be very time consuming . for instance , a typical simulation for a cluster with @xmath54 stars would require a parameter grid composed ( at least ) of 21 mass bins , 5 ages , 21 distance moduli , 21 foreground reddenings and 21 differential reddenings .",
    "then , including the @xmath52 clusters in the simulation , the runtime ( for the minimum grid ) is about 10 hours on a single core of an _ intel core i7 920@2.67ghz _ processor .",
    "before turning to actual cases , we apply the approach described above to template cmds built with typical parameters found in pms - rich young clusters .",
    "the main reason is to examine the ability to recover the input parameters and their relation with the 2  statistics .",
    "the relevant parameters of the adopted models cover the ranges @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the models are described in table  [ tab1 ] , which also contains quantitative details of the search for solutions on the 2  maps .    besides the single solution for the absolute 2  minimum",
    ", we also explore the solutions with 2  occurring within thresholds 5% , 10% , 25% , and 50% higher than the absolute minimum .",
    "for these , the parameters given in table  [ tab1 ] correspond to the weighted average of all the solutions matching each threshold . as weight for each solution",
    "we take the individual value of @xmath60 . except for a few cases , there s little difference among the average values of a given model , from the absolute minimum to the 50% threshold .",
    "as expected , the most noticeable difference in the output lies in the significantly increasing dispersion around the average for higher thresholds . although somewhat subjective , we believe that the _ best convergence _ is obtained with the 10% threshold ( which also produces realistic errors ) , which is consistent with the somewhat irregular topology of the 2  maps ( see below ) .",
    "overall , the approach seems very sensitive to the parameters , especially the age and differential reddening .",
    "the residual 2  of the 10%-higher solutions occur in the range @xmath61 . as an additional perspective on the statistical significance of the solutions within the adopted residual thresholds , we also provide in table  [ tab1 ]",

    "having demonstrated the convergence efficiency of our approach with artificial clusters ( sect .",
    "[ conexp ] ) , we now move on to examining properties of actual cases . for this",
    "we have selected two young clusters previously studied by our group , collinder197 ( @xcite ) and pismis5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "both present typical cmds of young clusters , with the difference that collinder197 has about 10 times more stars ( essentially pms ) in the cmd than pismis5 .    to put the results derived in the present paper in context ,",
    "we provide here a brief explanation of the previous method used by our group to obtain parameters of both clusters .",
    "while the procedure used in @xcite and @xcite to construct the field - star decontaminated cmds follows a quantitative approach , the fundamental parameter derivation used in both cases is somewhat subjective , depending essentially on a qualitative assessment of the differential reddening . specifically , the ms@xmath66pms isochrones ( for a range of ages ) are set to zero distance modulus and foreground reddening , and shifted in magnitude and colour until they produce a satisfactory fit of the blue border ( and redwards spread ) of the ms and pms stellar distribution",
    ". since we did not dispose of any quantitative tool to evaluate the differential reddening , we simply assumed it to be equivalent to the size of the reddening vector that matched the colour spread among the lower - pms sequences .",
    "for the ( cmd extracted from the ) region within @xmath67 from the centre of collinder197 , @xcite find @xmath68myr , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the distance from the sun @xmath72kpc . for @xmath73 of pismis5 , @xcite find @xmath68myr , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , and @xmath77kpc . the adopted age ( and uncertainty ) is simply the average ( and half the difference ) between the youngest and oldest ms@xmath66pms isochrones compatible with the cmd morphology .",
    "the mass was estimated by multiplying the number of cmd stars by the average stellar mass ( based on @xcite mf ) ; thus , it represents the cmd mass .    considering the above features , both clusters are excellent candidates to apply the present approach .",
    "given the low number of stars ( 101 ) in the cmd of pismis5 , we increased the number of simulated clusters to @xmath64 for statistically more significant results .",
    "collinder197 has 690 stars in the cmd , so , we kept @xmath53 . for a more comprehensive analysis ,",
    "we have applied our approach considering the binary fractions @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the fundamental parameters obtained with the present approach are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "most of the parameters are essentially insensitive to the presence of unresolved binaries in the cmd .",
    "this is especially true for the age , foreground reddening and , to a lesser degree , differential reddening . on the other hand , the most remarkable difference between the presence of ( cmd unresolved ) binary fractions of 0% and 100% lies in the cluster mass , with @xmath80 requiring @xmath81 twice more mass than for @xmath82",
    "next , the binary - related brightening of the stellar sequences ( for @xmath80 ) requires an apparent distance modulus , on average , 0.84 and 0.96 higher than for @xmath82 , respectively for collinder197 and pismis5 .",
    "this reflects on distances to the sun @xmath83 higher if @xmath80 . within the uncertainties , the parameters corresponding to @xmath84",
    "tend to be closer to those obtained with @xmath80 .",
    "also , for a given binary fraction , the parameters are essentially unchanged with respect to the 2  ranges considered , although with an increasing dispersion around the average for high 2 .",
    "finally , the convergence level of the approach , as measured by 2 , is essentially the same for the binary fractions considered here . in this sense",
    ", our approach appears to be insensitive to the binary fraction , at least for clusters with a significant age spread .",
    "irrespective of the binary fraction , our results confirm that pismis5 is indeed a very - low mass ( @xmath85 ) and young ( @xmath86myr ) cluster , affected by a moderate amount of differential reddening ( @xmath87 ) , and a low foreground reddening ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "such a low , together with the moderate apparent distance modulus ( @xmath89 , for @xmath82 ) , puts pismis5 at a distance from the sun of @xmath90kpc",
    ". however , this distance may be significantly higher ( @xmath91kpc ) if @xmath80 .    as anticipated , collinder197 is more massive ( @xmath92 ) and somewhat older ( @xmath93myr ) than pismis5 , also with a similar value of differential reddening ( @xmath87 ) , and a somewhat higher foreground reddening ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the distance moduli @xmath95 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath80 ) imply the distances @xmath77kpc and @xmath97kpc , respectively . under the assumptions adopted in sect .",

    "the 2  projections of collinder197 and pismis5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) present similar convergence patterns as those of the control tests ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , including the foreground and differential reddening anti - correlation .",
    "the residual 2  of the 10%-higher solutions of pismis5 ( @xmath98 ) is even lower than those of the control tests , and somewhat higher ( @xmath99 ) for collinder197 .",
    "however , we point out that part of this may be linked to the fact that collinder197 has @xmath100 times more stars in the cmd , which can result in a larger sum of the residuals .",
    "next , considering the low number of free parameters used by our approach , the observed and simulated hess diagrams ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) present a satisfactory correspondence . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare a single cmd realisation - randomly selected among the @xmath52 simulated clusters - with the observed cmds .",
    "having in mind the fact that both are low - mass , young clusters , some differences are more evident because of the low number of stars , especially in the ms , when an isolated , random cmd is used to illustrate the simulations .",
    "this effect should be particularly noticeable in poorly - populated clusters , such as pismis5 .",
    "nevertheless , simulated and observed cmds are similar , in both cases .",
    "in this paper we describe an approach based on cmds and near - infrared photometry to obtain more accurate fundamental parameters of young star clusters . however ,",
    "since the presence of large fractions of circumstellar disks around pms stars can lead to significant excesses in the near - infrared ( e.g. @xcite ) , the applicability of our approach may be restricted to clusters older than @xmath101myr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given its statistical nature , our method should be very efficient for well populated clusters , which give rise to smoother stellar - density distributions in the hess diagrams .",
    "but more interestingly , it is expected to work also with the low - mass clusters with cmds dominated by pms stars and significantly affected by differential reddening . among these parameters ,",
    "cluster mass and age are important to understand the dynamical state ( e.g. @xcite ) of clusters , especially those undergoing the rapidly changing and potentially - destructive evolutionary phase characterised by the first few @xmath0yr .",
    "the approach involves simulating the effect of ( random ) differential reddening on ms and pms stars , and its observable results on cmds . in this paper",
    "we apply it to cmds of star clusters simulated in the 2mass photometric system .",
    "obviously , it can be adapted to any photometric system , provided isochrones for low - mass stars and very young ages are available .    beginning with a given cluster mass ( ) and age ( ) , we distribute the individual stellar masses and magnitudes according to the @xcite mf and an ms@xmath66pms isochrone set .",
    "subsequently , we build the corresponding simulated hess diagram for different values of the apparent distance modulus ( ) , differential ( ) and foreground ( ) reddening values .",
    "we repeat this for a range of cluster mass and age , searching for the best match between the simulated and observed hess diagrams .",
    "the best - match parameters are searched around the minima of the hypersurface defined by the root mean squared residual @xmath102 .",
    "tests with model clusters containing parameters typical of objects undergoing such an early phase have shown that the present tool converges to the input values , especially when one allows for solutions that occur with 2  10% higher than the absolute minimum .",
    "we also investigate how unresolved binaries affect the derived parameters .",
    "compared to a cmd containing only single stars , even assuming a presence of 100% of unresolved binaries has little effect ( to within the uncertainties ) on cluster age , foreground and differential reddenings .",
    "significant differences occur in the cluster mass and distance from the sun . about twice more mass ( in individual stars )",
    "is required for @xmath80 than for @xmath82 , and because of the relative brightening due to the binaries , the distance from the sun is @xmath83 larger for @xmath80 than for @xmath82 .    as a caveat",
    "we note that we consider here a particular isochrone set .",
    "thus , the results of our approach tend to be model dependent , since different isochrone sets may lead to different values of mass and age of individual stars ( e.g. @xcite ) and , consequently , star clusters . in addition",
    ", we minimise the number of free parameters by assuming uniform ( or flat ) distributions of differential reddening and stellar age .",
    "both conditions may be partly unrealistic , especially the latter for clusters older than @xmath33myr , since it would imply a slow and steady star formation rate",
    ". however , the clusters we use here to test the approach , collinder197 and pismis5 , are younger than @xmath33myr .",
    "the relative low - mass nature of both clusters may imply cmds lacking constraints to find the _",
    "best values _ for a large number of free parameters .",
    "the general conclusion is that the inclusion in the simulations of several effects that affect the cmd morphology - especially the differential reddening - produces constrained values of the fundamental parameters .",
    "thus , when photometry is the only available information , our approach minimises the subjectiveness associated with the parameter derivation of young clusters .",
