    "growing interfaces appear everywhere in the natural world .",
    "some of them are as important as the technologically motivated thin film deposition , medically relevant as bacterial colonies development , and physically interesting as fluid flow in porous media . together with these",
    ", one finds a large variety of situations where the main driving mechanism is a growing fluctuating interface . despite their diverse origin ,",
    "all these phenomena have been studied within the common formalism of scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "this theory classifies different growth phenomena into university classes , characterized by sets of critical exponents which encode information about the interface morphology and dynamics . in consequence ,",
    "two different processes lying in the same universality class are supposed to have the same underlying physical mechanism driving the growth .",
    "this methodology has been successfully applied to a broad range of situations , but however , there are a number of restrictions that limit the traditional form of scaling analysis . one of them is the assumption that the interface can be described from a cartesian reference frame , standard for planar surfaces .",
    "another common assumption is the time independence of the substrate size . despite the usefulness of the cartesian representation in many cases ,",
    "there are some growth profiles that can not be described according to it . physical settings such as fluid flow in porous media  @xcite , grain - grain displacement in hele - shaw cells  @xcite , fracture dynamics  @xcite , adatom and vacancy islands on crystal surfaces  @xcite , and atomic ledges bordering crystalline facets  @xcite present interfaces that violate the hypothesis of the cartesian representation .",
    "biological systems are also characterized by an approximate spherical symmetry : bacterial colonies  @xcite , fungi  @xcite , epithelial cells  @xcite , and cauliflowers  @xcite develop rough surfaces which are not describable from a planar reference frame . also , different contexts like the technological liquid composite molding  @xcite , geological processes as stromatolite morphogenesis  @xcite , and chemical structures  @xcite provide examples of interfaces that either become larger as time evolves or have a curved geometry , revealing the broad presence of this phenomenon in the natural world .",
    "the theoretical study of non - equilibrium radial growth probably started with the seminal work of eden  @xcite , but the use of stochastic growth equations appeared only more recently , with the introduction of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation in reparametrization invariant form  @xcite .",
    "subsequent works were devoted to the radial ( @xmath0 ) kpz equation  @xcite , the radial ( @xmath0 ) and spherical ( @xmath1 ) mullins - herring ( mh ) equation  @xcite , and the general reparametrization invariant formulation of stochastic growth equations  @xcite .",
    "an analytical approach to these equations @xcite showed that for short spatial scales and time intervals the dynamics of radial interfaces was equivalent to that of the planar case ; however , long time intervals yielded a different output . in a recent work these results",
    "have been expanded showing that for fast surface growth dilution acts as a dominant mechanism in the large scale @xcite , explaining the discrepancies in this limit .",
    "dilution refers to the fact that the already deposited material becomes distributed in a larger area , and it thus gets diluted inside the material being deposited at the time .",
    "herein we will limit ourselves to large spatial scale properties of solutions to equations whose planar counterparts are linear , and we will generalize our previous results @xcite .",
    "the numerical study of the eden model in @xcite suggests that dilution is not taking place in this particular model ; using this result as a benchmark we will phenomenologically neglect dilution in the equations under consideration .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ radial ] we study growing radial interfaces and section  [ spherical ] is concerned with spherical interfaces ; in both cases we consider a broader range of relaxation mechanisms than in the previous work @xcite .",
    "section  [ other ] is devoted to different geometries of physical interest , which are introduced in this work for the sake of completeness , and finally , in section  [ outlook ] we draw our main conclusions and discuss possible lines for future research .",
    "the equation of growth of a general curved surface reads  @xcite @xmath2+\\vec{\\phi}({\\bf s},t),\\ ] ] where the @xmath3 dimensional surface vector @xmath4 runs over the surface as @xmath5 varies in a parameter space . in this equation",
    "@xmath6 stands for the unitary vector normal to the surface at @xmath7 , @xmath8 contains a deterministic growth mechanism that causes growth along the normal @xmath6 to the surface , and @xmath9 is a random force acting on the surface .",
    "the stochastic term acts on the normal direction too @xmath10 , while the noise @xmath11 is assumed to be a gaussian variable with zero mean and correlation given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the metric tensor determinant and the einstein summation convention has been adopted .",
    "the tensor @xmath14 specifies the geometric properties of the noise . in our case",
    "we will only consider isotropic noises , i. e. @xmath15 , implying @xmath16 .",
    "anisotropic noises appear , for instance , when considering deposition from a collimated beam of particles @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us start considering radial geometry , characterized by the position vector @xmath17 most of the two - dimensional examples mentioned at the introduction belong to this class : adatom and vacancy islands on crystal surfaces , bacterial colonies , fungi , ... .",
    "the shape of radial interfaces was illustrated by means of numerical simulations in @xcite and @xcite ; their deterministic evolution is analogous to that of an elliptic interface of null eccentricity , see sec .",
    "[ other ] and fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] .",
    "the effect of stochasticity in this @xmath0 system was estimated logarithmic on average  @xcite .",
    "this result was obtained by means of a small noise expansion of the radial random deposition equation at first order in the fluctuation intensity .",
    "of course , small noise expansions are appropriate only for limited times , as the unbounded nature of the gaussian noise makes them invalid for arbitrary long times , for which the probability of rare events is not negligible .",
    "however , in our particular cases , this type of expansions yields reasonable results , as we will show .",
    "we will perform now a more detailed analysis of this phenomenon using edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) dynamics .",
    "the radial ew equation is the following it equation  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a zero mean gaussian noise whose correlation is given by @xmath20 using now the second order small noise expansion  @xcite @xmath21 yields @xmath22 where @xmath23 one can see that the fluctuations present in the system in the large scale come from the @xmath24 dynamics .",
    "the reason is that the noise sources in the @xmath25 equation are subdominant .",
    "this can be seen by deriving the equation for the correlation @xmath26 .",
    "the most stochastic term appearing in the resulting equation is proportional to the four points function @xmath27 where the equality holds because the other products of two points functions vanish due to the noise interpretation .",
    "this is a consequence of the it interpretation in eq .",
    "( [ ew11 ] ) , which implies @xmath28 . since we are decomposing the solution in the small noise expansion ( [ smallnoise ] ) the statistical independence among the solution and the noise holds at every order .",
    "we know the value of the correlator  @xcite @xmath29 which increases as the logarithm of time . as the four points function",
    "is multiplied by @xmath30 , this is equivalent to have the noise term damped as in the two dimensional situation ( see  @xcite and sec .  [ spherical ] ) , making it subdominant , and the @xmath24 random variable divided by @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitude of this random variable increases as the square root of the logarithm of time , so this ratio vanishes in the long time limit too .",
    "the rest of the stochastic terms in the equation for the correlation  @xmath32 either vanish due to the noise interpretation or have logarithmic amplitudes .",
    "as all these terms are multiplied by a negative power of the temporal variable they vanish in the long time limit , just like the terms we have considered here .",
    "this implies that the noise terms only contribute to create some constant prefactor , like in higher dimensional radial equations  @xcite .",
    "this remains true for all higher orders in the small noise expansion , so we can conclude that the stochasticity present in the system comes from either the perturbation @xmath24 or non - analytic effects . to estimate the effect of these exponentially infrequent events we make use of large deviation theory in appendix  [ deviation ] , where we show evidence pointing to their irrelevance using the radial random deposition equation .",
    "so combining these results suggests that the stochasticity present in the system comes from the first order term in the small noise expansion .",
    "of course , this result is not rigorous , but indicates that only a very slow process can modify it . taking into account the explicit temporal dependence in the equations for the stochastic perturbations",
    "it is clear that this type of process will be more and more infrequent as time evolves . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", the probability of observing such a rare event will be negligible for evolution times of interest .",
    "this will simplify the forthcoming analyses .",
    "note that the present situation is completely different to that of the kpz or other nonlinear planar stochastic growth equations . for them",
    "the small noise expansion is only valid for short times , but higher order corrections in this expansion or a wkb analysis show the measurable effect that small fluctuations have on the dynamics ; contrarily , these sorts of analysis have shown negligible corrections in the current case , as we have shown in this section and in appendix [ deviation ] .    before moving to different dynamics ,",
    "let us clarify some properties of the radial ew equation .",
    "when we talk about the irrelevance of the infrequent events we refer to the behavior in the hydrodynamic limit , characterized by @xmath33 . for small sizes of the cluster , stochastic dynamics might be affected by the fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ rew ] ) , that separates the shrinking and the expanding tendencies  @xcite . in this regime",
    ", rare events might promote changes among these two types of evolution .",
    "in the long time limit and large spatial scale , however , radial ew dynamics reduces to radial random deposition  @xcite , and thus infrequent events become irrelevant , in agreement with the results reported in appendix  [ deviation ] .",

    "( [ rew ] ) and a study of its dynamics is reported in  @xcite and in sec .",
    "[ spherical ] , and the analysis of the radial ew equation metastability properties is performed in  @xcite and in appendix  [ metastability ] .",
    "it is easy to generalize the ew equation to fractional orders in the planar case  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes a riesz derivative , and its action on the function height @xmath36 is defined by means of its fourier transform @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the fourier variable .",
    "the case @xmath39 corresponds to the ew equation .",
    "the object of introducing these equations is twofold . on one hand",
    "they allow understanding the interplay of the value of exponent @xmath40 , which specifies the velocity at which correlations propagate , and the other characteristics of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "these fractional operators are common models describing anomalous transport properties of complex systems @xcite . in this sense",
    ", one can think of fractional equations as physical generalizations of the classical laplacian diffusion .",
    "it is not so straightforward however to obtain these equations in a general manifold .",
    "let us recall the beltrami - laplace operator in one dimension @xmath41 where @xmath42 parameterizes the corresponding manifold .",
    "its structure suggests us a possible definition of `` square - root '' of this operator as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is some derivative with the desired properties . due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of this operator",
    ", we can not define a fractional derivative along the lines of the riesz one , because it takes advantage of the linearity of the ordinary derivative in order to use the fourier transform .",
    "nevertheless , we can generalize the radial ew equation to fractional orders assuming @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the perturbation obeying the equation @xmath47 in the interval @xmath48 $ ] , where the solution is subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this equation , in the long time limit , coincides with the corresponding ew one when @xmath39 , except for one term coming from the nonlinear dynamics of the curved surface , see eq .",
    "( [ rew1 ] ) .",
    "so this toy model retains part of the properties of the equation of motion for the interface , but part of the curvature effects is lost , and these are the cause of some stability deterioration as have been seen  @xcite .",

    "the ellipse lying on this plane is similar to the one just described above but the random deposition model reads in this case @xmath147 near the major axis , and @xmath148 near the minor axis , where @xmath149 is a zero mean gaussian noise whose correlation is given by @xmath150 like in the @xmath0 case the neighborhood of the major axis is affected by reduced growth rate and fluctuations intensity , while the neighborhood of the minor axis undergoes a smaller reduction of the fluctuations intensity but its growth rate remains unchanged . as in the spherical case , the strong negative power of the radius in the noise term will cause a constant average roughness that depends on the perturbation initial time .",

    "radial random deposition is characterized by an uncorrelated interface of a logarithmic temporal amplitude , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the model with ballistic correlations propagation , introduced here in radial geometry , shows a richer phenomenology . despite the logarithmic temporal dependence , the correlation function is markedly different .",
    "in fact , the analysis of this function for long times and short angular scales reveals the appearance of a local dynamical exponent @xmath178 , which is equal to the ratio of the constant rate of radius growth @xmath66 and the ballistic diffusion constant @xmath67 , and it is thus nonuniversal .",

    "we have been able to reproduce them in elliptic , hyperbolic , and parabolic geometries , which undergo particular nonlinear effects , but share the same stochastic dynamics .",
    "the differences among the classical results on surface growth and the current ones are related to the substrate growth properties .",
    "the classical setting assumes a constant @xmath179 dimensional substrate size , and growth is restricted to the @xmath180th spatial dimension . in the parameterizations we have considered here , growth happens equally in every spatial dimension , a fact that has been ensured by keeping constant the eccentricity of the different underlying conical structures .",
    "indeed , in sec .",
    "[ other ] we have kept the eccentricity constant explicitly by means of the introduction of the parameter @xmath181 . in this same section ,",
    "hyperbolic geometry has been implicitly supposed of @xmath182 eccentricity , but assuming an arbitrary constant eccentricity would yield a straightforward modification of these results , just along the lines of the elliptic case , and it would rend the stochastic dynamics unchanged . a different situation might arise if the eccentricity changes along the evolution .",
    "for instance , consider an ellipsoid growing in all spatial dimensions at different rates .",
    "its shape will change in time , and this might affect the surface dynamics . in this case , different spatio - temporal scales will enter in competition , and the resulting growth dynamics might combine features of the different scenarios studied so far and perhaps new ones . in any case , due to the complex nature of these growth regimes , it is necessary to build some analytical progress before drawing any conclusions about them .",
    "a necessary step in the following is the study of the relationship among stochastic growth equations and discrete models . on the applied side , important",
    "technological processes such as liquid composite molding  @xcite are driven by growing radial interfaces .",
    "the theoretical study of this sort of systems is often based on detailed numerical simulations , which could be simplified using eikonal descriptions like the stochastic growth equations presented here .",
    "the duality expansion versus shrinking present in the radial and spherical ew equations and is equation might be related to some of the observed phenomena .",

    "[ radial ] and  [ spherical ] .",

    "however , the presence of the noise term can alter this scenario .",
    "we can interpret eq .",

    "we are thus led to the equation @xmath221 taking the square root we find @xmath222 where we have selected the negative square root .",
    "the positive square root is the instanton solution that indicates the optimal path for escaping from the potential well  @xcite .",
    "re - changing variables to recover the description in terms of @xmath86 we find @xmath223 which is nothing but the stratonovich equation  ( [ stratonovich ] ) with the noise term suppressed  @xcite . the mean field equation  ( [ effeq ] ) represents motion on the effective potential @xmath224 which is positively divergent at the origin , justifying the choice of a reflecting boundary at the origin earlier in eq .",

    "so we see that the simple picture of bistability drawn by the small noise expansion can be modified due to the divergent amplitude of the fluctuations at the origin .",
