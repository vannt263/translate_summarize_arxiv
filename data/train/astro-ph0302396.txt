    "in general , we might also be interested in the case where a cosmological constant is present ( @xmath31cdm model ) since this seems to be favored by recent observations .",

    "we will not study in details all the predictions that can be done from the two - point correlation function since our main purpose in this note is to calculate the non - gaussianity which is a clear specific signature of a non vacuum state .",

    "we have now normalized the matter power spectrum to cobe .",
    "it is important to realize that the above procedure only works for the scdm model since we have used the sachs - wolfe equation .",

    "an important shortcoming of the previous definition is that the value of @xmath103 depends on the normalization .",
    "it is much more convenient to work with a normalized ( dimensionless ) quantity .",
    "therefore , we also define the normalized excess kurtosis as @xmath104 which is the one more commonly used in the literature .",

    "in fact , this shows that the quantity @xmath106 does not depend very much on the free parameters .",
    "one can see this is true for parameters @xmath107 and @xmath4 since , using the above mentioned analytical estimate , we find , for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and for @xmath110 , @xmath111 . since we know that this result does not depend on the details of the weight function @xmath64",
    ", we conclude that the asymptotic value obtained above is a generic value , at least for large values of @xmath20 . in particular ,",
    "this is true for @xmath112 which corresponds to the built - in scale located roughly at the privileged scale in the matter power spectrum selected by the redshift surveys of ref .",
    "another important remark is that the excess kurtosis is found to be negative .",
    "the above paragraphs show that the introduction of non - vacuum initial states leads to a clear prediction for the excess kurtosis parameter .",
    "however , this by itself does not imply that the signature will be observable .",
    "the signal to theoretical noise ratio has to be considered or , stating it differently , we need to make the comparison of the signal against the cosmic variance .",
    "the cosmic variance quantifies the theoretical error coming from the fact that , in cosmology , observers have only access to one realization of the @xmath113 stochastic process whereas theoretical predictions are expressed through ensemble averages .",
    "the specific computation of the cosmic variance for the model under consideration was performed  @xcite and found to be some four orders of magnitude higher than the signal itself .",
    "this is no surprise : we are interested in a non - gaussian signature of primordial origin , and thus we are focusing on large angular scales , for which the theoretical uncertainties are the highest . shifting to intermediate angular scales , a stronger signal would be obtained ; however , in that case secondary sources would be more difficult to subtract and thus the transparency of the effect would be compromised .    in sum , the excess kurtosis is found to be negative and the signal to noise ratio for the dimensionless excess kurtosis parameter is equal to @xmath114 , almost independently of the free parameters of the model .",
    "this signature turns out to be undetectable and therefore we conclude that , subject to current tests , gaussianity is a generic property of single field inflationary models .",
