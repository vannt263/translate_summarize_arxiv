    "the study of event - by - event fluctuations in various quantities like average transverse momentum , multiplicity , and conserved quantities such as net charge , may provide evidence for formation of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the event - by - event transverse momentum fluctuations can be related to the temperature fluctuations which are related to specific heat of the system  @xcite . the non - monotonic change of @xmath2 correlations as a function of centrality and/or as the incident energy can also be a possible signal of qgp  @xcite .",
    "several investigations have been carried out on the study of fluctuations and correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "measurements performed by the star collaboration showed that transverse momentum fluctuations in au+au collisions at rhic energies are finite but small relative to prediction invoking the formation of qgp  @xcite .",
    "we present @xmath0 fluctuations and correlations in cu+cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev and compare with those in au+au collisions at similar energies to investigate the system size dependence .",
    "data for this analysis were obtained using the solenoidal tracker at rhic(star ) detector employing a 0.5 t uniform magnetic field parallel to the beam axis .",
    "we study cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 = 62.4 and 200 gev .",
    "the detector used in this analysis is the time projection chamber(tpc ) .",
    "the events are required to have a vertex within @xmath3 25 cm along the beam pipe from the center of star .",
    "the charged particle tracks used were required to have at least 20 hits in the tpc and have originated within 1 cm of the measured event vertex .",
    "events were accepted within 1 cm of the center of star in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "tracks from tpc with 0.15 gev / c @xmath4",
    "@xmath0 @xmath4 2.0 gev / c with @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 @xmath7 1.0 were used in this analysis .",
    "the collision centrality is determined by using uncorrected multiplicity of all charged particles measured in tpc within @xmath8 @xmath7 0.5 .",
    "each centrality bin was represented by the number of participating nucleons , @xmath9 , using a glauber monte carlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "data analysed are from minimum bias triggers .",
    "the @xmath0 fluctuations are studied by comparing the mean and rms deviations of the event - by event mean @xmath0 ( @xmath7@xmath0@xmath10 ) distributions of data and mixed events .",
    "mixed events were constructed by randomly selecting one track from an event chosen from the measured events in the same centrality keeping the same event multiplicity as in the data .",
    "we study the dynamical fluctuations defined as : @xmath11 = @xmath12 . where @xmath13 is the rms value of the @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath10 distribution of data and @xmath14 is the rms value of the @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath10 distribution of mixed events .",
    "the transverse momentum correlations are studied using the following equation  @xcite : @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the number of events in a particular centrality , @xmath17 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath18 track in each event , @xmath19 is the number of tracks in the @xmath20 event . the overall event average transverse momentum @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average transverse momentum in the @xmath20 event .",

    "the errors shown in the results are statistical only .",
    "distributions for the data are wider than those of mixed events indicating the presence of non - statistical fluctuations at both incident energies .",
    "similar results are obtained for other centralities .",
    "we find that the dynamical fluctuations varies from 4.1% to 2.3% as the collision centrality goes from 30 - 40@xmath25 ( peripheral ) to 0 - 10@xmath25 ( most central ) at both the energies .",
    "the lines in figures represent gamma distributions given as :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 = @xmath28/@xmath29 and @xmath30= @xmath29/@xmath31 in gev / c . here",

    "tannenbaum  @xcite showed that without @xmath2 cuts the @xmath27/@xmath7n@xmath10 should be 2 following the gamma distribution and @xmath30@xmath7n@xmath10 reflects the temperature of the @xmath2 distribution .",

    "the @xmath0 correlations are finite and decrease with increase in number of participants for both cu+cu and au+au collisions .",
    "this decrease in @xmath0 correlations could be due to correlations being dominated from pair of particles coming from the same nucleon - nucleon collision which get diluted with increasing the number of participants .",
