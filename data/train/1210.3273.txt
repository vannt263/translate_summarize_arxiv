    "the icecube neutrino telescope at the south pole has successfully been completed in december 2010 .",
    "icecube is the most sensitive telescope to date to search for high - energy neutrino sources , whose existence is intimately related to the acceleration of hadrons and their interaction in the environment of their accelerator .",
    "the interaction of high - energy protons and nuclei with ambient matter or radiation leads to the generation of both gamma - rays and neutrinos of similar energy @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to infer the contribution of a possible hadronic component from the observed gamma - rays , since gamma - ray emission can also be produced by relativistic electrons via inverse compton scattering .",
    "moreover , the most energetic gamma - rays have a high probability to be absorbed on their way to earth , and the observed spectra may , after successive absorption and emission processes @xcite , not be the same as the primary spectra .",
    "the detection of a flux of high - energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources , even if challenging , can thus provide unique insights into the acceleration mechanisms and the origin of cosmic - rays .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope has a full - sky field of view at any time and has thus the potential to observe neutrino point sources at any position in the sky albeit with different discovery potential depending on the source location and the neutrino energy spectrum of the source . for a source following an e@xmath1 spectrum in the energy range from 1  tev up to a few pev icecube can discover high - energy neutrino sources at the flux level of @xmath5  @xmath6 @xcite if the source location is known from other observations .",
    "assuming isotropic emission , this translates to source luminosities of @xmath7 for a source at a distance of 2  kpc .",
    "a search for neutrino point sources at any location in the sky with the icecube 40-strings detector has been presented in @xcite using e@xmath1 and flatter spectra for the optimization of the analysis .",
    "this work focusses on the more specific case of galactic neutrino sources and the energy spectra associated to them .    among the most promising candidate sources of cosmic - rays in the galaxy",
    "are the remnants of supernovae ( both shell - type and pulsar wind nebulae ) , the jets of microquasars , and the collective winds of massive stars @xcite . due to the large amount of energy released in a supernova explosion ( @xmath8  erg ) , supernova remnants",
    "are prime candidates to be sources of galactic cosmic - rays . in microquasars , the kinetic energy carried by the jet accounts for at least @xmath9 , inferred from the observed non - thermal luminosities @xcite .",
    "the total energy injected into the interstellar medium by the winds of ob and wolf - rayet stars can be as high as @xmath10 , like in the case of the cygnus ob2 association @xcite ; and levels of @xmath11 can be achieved by a single young pulsar .",
    "what remains undetermined is the fraction of total energy per source that goes into cosmic - ray acceleration , as well as the probability for the interaction of cosmic - rays close to their source .",
    "the observation of the products of cosmic - ray interactions , i.e. gamma - rays and neutrinos , can shed light on these still unsolved problems .",
    "the highest energies ( e > 100  tev ) are only accessible by means of extensive air - shower ( eas ) arrays , in the case of gamma - rays , and @xmath12-volume neutrino detectors like icecube . results from milagro @xcite and argo - ybj @xcite , demonstrate that the gamma - ray emission is faint at very high energies @xcite .",
    "however , these gamma - ray observations do not impose constraints on neutrino production , due to internal and external absorption of gamma - rays at the energies considered .",
    "most of our knowledge of gamma - ray sources comes from cherenkov telescopes like h.e.s.s . , magic , and veritas , working in the energy range 100  gev - 100  tev . in the past few years , a large family of galactic accelerators",
    "have been observed to have the bulk of their gamma - ray emission at energies below 50  tev and/or to be softer than the @xmath13 spectrum that is generally expected from first - order fermi shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "many of these sources reside relatively nearby , and external gamma - ray absorption in the interstellar radiation field is not likely .",
    "if the detected gamma - rays are related to hadronic acceleration and are produced in transparent sources , the expected distribution of neutrino energies has the same spectral index and a lower energy cutoff than the gamma - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "the modeling of cosmic - ray sources with diffusive shock acceleration also allows for the presence of spectra steeper or flatter than the generic e@xmath1 behavior , depending on the configuration of the shock @xcite .",
    "the influence of diffusion in the sources themselves may modify the spectra to produce primary spectra of e@xmath14 or steeper @xcite . in order to target soft - spectra sources ,",
    "we have optimized the search here reported for a generic spectrum proportional to e@xmath2 .",
    "in this work , we use the 22- and 40-strings configurations of icecube ( ic22 , ic40 ) as well as the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) ( ic22+a , ic40+a ) to enhance the sensitivity for soft - spectra sources , or sources with energy cut - offs .",
    "we have used amanda as an integrated low - energy extension of ic22 and ic40 and developed an analysis strategy that is optimized for a high retention of signal events below 10  tev .",
    "we have used the resulting low - energy optimized data samples to search for galactic neutrino emission above @xmath15200  gev . at these energies , icecube s field of view",
    "covers the range of galactic longitude @xmath16 , as illustrated in figure  [ galaxy ] .",
    "the performed searches include a scan of the accessible part of the galactic plane , a dedicated analysis of the cygnus region , the search for neutrino emission from a pre - defined list of interesting astrophysical objects and an analysis that searches for time - dependent neutrino emission from cygnus x-3 in correlation with radio flares .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the relevant technical aspects of icecube , of amanda and of its integration into icecube .",
    "section 3 reports about the analysis methods that have been applied and the respective astrophysical targets .",
    "section 4 explains the details and characteristics of the obtained data samples , and section 5 provides the results .",
    "( i.e. lower left region).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "during the construction phase from 2004 to 2010 , the operational configuration of icecube increased year by year ( see figure  [ ic_am ] ) to finally cover a volume of approximately one cubic kilometer .",
    "icecube , including its deepcore extension , is composed of 86 strings each holding 60 digital optical modules ( doms ) .",
    "each dom contains a 10-inch photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and an on - board signal read - out and digitization system , all housed in a glass pressure vessel @xcite .",
    "78 of the 86 strings in the array form a hexagonal grid with a typical distance of 125  m between neighboring strings .",
    "the vertical distance between doms on the same string is 17  m. the remaining 8 strings are part of the low - energy extension deepcore @xcite and are deployed in the deepest , clearest ice at the center of the detector with a smaller vertical and horizontal spacing between the doms of 7  m and 60  m , respectively . the doms detect cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary charged particles produced in interactions of high - energy neutrinos with nuclei in the ice or the bedrock below the ice . to enhance the detection of light from upward - going particles , the pmts point downwards . in order to avoid a deterioration of the analog pmt signal ,",
    "the signal is digitized directly in the doms with a set of analog transient waveform digitizers ( atwds ) and a fast analog to digital converter ( fadc ) @xcite .",
    "the events that are used in this analysis are selected by a multiplicity trigger which requires at least 8 hit doms within a time window of @xmath17sec .",
    "the doms send their recorded signals to the surface and an event is constructed if the trigger conditions are met . in the detector configurations used in this work , only doms for which there is also a signal from one of the nearest two doms above or the nearest two doms below within 1 @xmath18sec ( so - called hard local coincidence ) are considered in the trigger and the event building to suppress noise contributions .",
    "an event contains all dom readouts associated with the trigger as well as all further readouts within @xmath19sec around the trigger time .      after a construction phase from 1993 until 2000 ,",
    "the completed amanda - ii detector took data as a standalone neutrino telescope from february 2000 until december 2006 .",
    "this configuration consisted of 677 optical modules ( oms ) on 19 strings .",
    "most of the optical modules were deployed at depths between 1500 and 2000  m whereas icecube extends down to 2450  m. for data analysis , a total of 526 oms have been used .",
    "the amanda strings follow a roughly cylindrical geometry , as is shown in figure  [ ic_am ] .",
    "the typical distance between adjacent strings is around 40  m and the average vertical spacing between the modules is about 15 m . from february 2007 until april 2009",
    ", amanda was operated as an integrated part of icecube . in many aspects , icecube is technologically more advanced than amanda , reflecting general progress as well as experience collected during the operation of amanda @xcite . in particular",
    ", the signal transfer from the optical modules to the surface is different .",
    "as mentioned above , icecube doms digitize the pmt signal directly in the ice .",
    "they also generate the hv for the pmts in the doms .",
    "in contrast , amanda oms produced analog signals that were sent to the amanda data acquisition system which was located in the martin a. pomerantz observatory ( mapo ) .",
    "the original data acquisition system ( daq ) could register the leading and trailing edge time of up to 8 pulses per om per event and only the total charge .",
    "the same cables were used to transfer the analog data and to provide the hv to the pmts . for amanda strings 11 to 19 , an additional connection via optical fibers",
    "was installed to transmit the pmt signals with a better time resolution .",
    "moreover , amanda string 18 @xcite was equipped with prototypes for the icecube doms , including the capability of on - board waveform digitization .",
    "this option however was used only in testing mode and was not included in the data acquisition schemes used for physics analysis .",
    "the amanda daq was upgraded starting from 2002 .",
    "flash adc modules called transient waveform recorders ( twrs ) were installed in the new daq in order to digitize the analog waveforms from the amanda oms at the surface . the upgraded data acquisition operated in parallel to the analog one until 2006 . from 2007 on , only the twr - daq was operational .",
    "this surface waveform digitization stored more information such as the induced charge and the arrival times of individual pulses .",
    "as the twr - daq was also faster than the previous daq , the trigger threshold could be reduced .",
    "trigger thresholds from 8 to 13 hit oms were used during different years .",
    "this upgrade significantly improved the performance of amanda and ultimately allowed to use it to enhance icecube s performance at low energies @xcite .",
    "since amanda is about eight times more densely instrumented than icecube and fully surrounded by icecube strings , it offered the potential to increase the low - energy performance of icecube and to be used as the first low - energy core inside a large neutrino telescope .",
    "this lead to its integration in the data taking of icecube .",
    "the operational integration of amanda into icecube required the establishment of connections between the two detectors for the exchange of trigger information to be able to merge events as well as for an accurate synchronization in time .",
    "mapo is about 300  m away from the icecube control lab ( icl ) that houses the icecube surface data acquisition .",
    "optical fibers have been used in order to connect the two buildings . moreover ,",
    "a tcp / ip connection was established for the communication between the buildings .",
    "a gps module was installed to synchronize the twrs responsible for the digitization of the amanda waveforms and to synchronize the detector with icecube .",
    "the icecube clock was used as reference .",
    "an optical fiber connection was used to transmit the amanda trigger signal to icecube . in the integrated mode ,",
    "amanda and icecube were still triggered separately .",
    "since amanda had a lower energy threshold than icecube , a readout of icecube was initiated every time amanda triggered , even if there were not sufficient hits in icecube to produce a trigger by itself .",
    "amanda was not read - out in correspondence with icecube triggers .",
    "events from amanda and icecube were merged on the basis of a time coincidence . as the duration of amanda records was fixed to 10.24  @xmath18s , while the duration of icecube records was extended if new triggers occurred within the readout window there was a possibility that more than one record in amanda was associated with one record in icecube . in this case",
    ", they were all included in the same combined event .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope monitors the entire sky without the need of explicit pointing .",
    "the energy- and zenith - dependent sensitivity of the icecube 40-strings configuration are described in @xcite . in previous works ,",
    "a generic , unbroken @xmath13 signal spectrum up to the pev region has been assumed for the optimization of the data analysis and the evaluation of the detector performance @xcite .",
    "this approach achieves the best signal to noise in the energy range above a few tev , since the assumed signal spectrum is significantly harder than the characteristic spectrum of ( background ) atmospheric neutrinos @xmath20 .",
    "however , a lower energy threshold is of primary importance for the search for neutrino sources characterized by an energy cutoff or by soft spectra . in the optimization of the analysis ,",
    "we have used a generic , soft power - law spectrum following @xmath21 and we have also considered the crab nebula spectrum measured by h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite which would correspond to a neutrino spectrum @xmath22 with an exponential cutoff at 7  tev ( provided that all the measured gamma - rays are of hadronic nature ) .",
    "this last spectrum is representative of a `` low - energy '' source and its study is very instructive in the understanding of the impact of an energy cutoff on the performance of icecube",
    ". we will refer to this spectrum throughout the paper as a `` crab - like '' spectrum .",
    "we report in the following on the different searches that have been performed .",
    "the location of the solar system in the local spiral arm gives us a particular view of the galaxy .",
    "given the vertical scale of the thin disk and the distribution of cold gas in the galaxy , we see most of the galactic accelerators projected in a narrow band close to the galactic plane .",
    "in the energy range of interest for the detection of galactic neutrino sources , icecube can explore the northern sky , which includes part of the first quadrant of the galaxy , the whole second quadrant , and a small portion of the third galactic quadrant .",
    "the search for neutrino sources in the galactic plane is performed by superimposing a fine grid over the region of the sky within the galactic coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the step size of the grid is chosen to be smaller than the angular resolution achieved in the analysis reported in section 4.4.2 .    in the analysis of ic22+a ,",
    "a grid of @xmath25 has been used , while a @xmath26 grid has been chosen for the ic40+a , given the improved angular resolution ( see figure  [ ang_res ] ) . at each point of the grid",
    ", an unbinned maximum likelihood ratio test is performed on all selected events .",
    "the likelihood of a composite signal and background hypothesis is compared to the background - only hypothesis , similar to the method described in @xcite , without the inclusion of an energy term in the likelihood .",
    "seven particularly interesting sources have been studied individually in this analysis as representatives of different types of galactic accelerators .",
    "the interest in these sources is motivated by the observation of a gev - tev gamma - ray counterpart at the time of the analysis . for cygnus x-3 , due to the high variability in the radio and x - ray bands , we have tested the hypothesis of variable neutrino emission and performed a time - dependent analysis .",
    "the other sources are listed below and are treated as steady point source candidates .",
    "* crab nebula , distance:@xmath152.0  kpc * @xcite : the crab nebula is powered by a pulsar with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath27 .",
    "this energy is injected into relativistic particles and magnetic fields @xcite , although the exact composition of the pulsar wind , as well as the mechanism by which the total power of the pulsar is transported and dissipated is not known .",
    "it is an efficient particle accelerator , where @xmath28 of the total power of the pulsar is injected into relativistic electrons which emit synchrotron radiation from radio to x - rays @xcite .",
    "although it appears as the strongest gamma - ray source in the sky , the ratio between the gamma - ray luminosity at e @xmath29 1  tev and the spin - down luminosity is of the order of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this is that electrons rapidly lose their energy through synchrotron radiation at lower frequencies , and that the majority of cosmic - rays , if present in a significant proportion , escape from the source without interaction .",
    "the constraint on the steady neutrino production in the crab obtained by icecube @xcite is at the level of @xmath31 , a factor of @xmath32 larger than the luminosity in gamma - rays assuming the h.e.s.s .",

    "the high - energy emission is thought to arise from the interaction between a composite snr ( w51c ) with a molecular cloud present in the region .",
    "the high luminosities observed in gev gamma - rays , greater than @xmath9 , and the hints of a hadronic origin for the gamma - ray spectrum makes this an interesting target for icecube despite its large distance .",
    "the magic collaboration recently extended the spectrum from the highest fermi / lat energies to 5  tev and finds that the spectral index of the source follows a single power law with an index of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "* ls  i+61  303 , distance:@xmath152.0  kpc * @xcite : this source is a high - mass x - ray binary with a compact object in an eccentric orbit around a be star",

    "magic detected very high energy emission modulated with the orbital period @xcite .",

    "no tev emission is observed at periastron , although significant gamma - ray absorption in the strong radiation field of the be star is expected in this case @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported by the detection of mev - gev gamma - rays by the fermi satellite @xcite , which may result from the cascade process in @xmath39 .",
    "the hypothesis of particle injection along the whole orbit is then a plausible option .",
    "this , together with the considerable amount of both matter and radiation from the companion star available for cosmic ray interactions , makes this source an interesting candidate for steady neutrino emission . for the search of periodic neutrino emission from binary systems performed by icecube",
    ", we refer to @xcite .    * ss  433 , distance:@xmath155.0  kpc * @xcite : ss  433 is a confirmed microquasar and a black hole candidate in orbit around a massive star .",

    "it is the only x - ray binary system in which hadrons have been found in the jet @xcite .",
    "the entire source is embedded within a nebulous structure ( w50 ) which is thought to be the expanding supernova shells of the progenitor star of the black hole in ss  433 .",
    "the source has been searched for by the hegra , magic , and cangaroo - ii cherenkov telescopes @xcite , resulting in upper limits for the gamma - ray emission from both the inner system and the different interaction regions with the w50 nebula .",
    "strong gamma - ray absorption is expected from this system , due to the periodic eclipses through the companion star as well as attenuation due to the precession of the accretion disk envelope @xcite . as in the case of ls i+61 303 , the presence of a significant amount of target material for cosmic ray interactions as well as the possibility of a higher energy emission than what is inferred from gamma - ray observations due to absorption , makes this an interesting candidate for a neutrino source .",
    "ss  433 has also been tested for possible periodic neutrino emission in @xcite .",
    "the cygnus region is roughly located within galactic longitudes @xmath41 and latitudes @xmath42 , where our line of sight is directed nearly along the local spiral arm of the galaxy @xcite . at a distance of approximately 5",
    "kpc our line of sight has left the local arm and crosses the perseus arm , and even the outer arm further away ( @xmath010  kpc ) . here",
    "many different sources are located at various distances superimposed in a relatively small area in the sky , resulting in a complex region which harbors some of the closest and most massive regions of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "the vast majority of the molecular gas detected in the cygnus region is concentrated on the local arm @xcite , at distances between 1 - 3  kpc .",
    "one of the most massive giant molecular cloud complexes in the galaxy resides within this region , at a distance of @xmath151.7  kpc .",
    "it is thought to be the birth place of the massive cyg ob2 association , and probably also cyg ob9 and cyg ob1 , as well as of a number of less massive star clusters with young stars or ongoing star formation @xcite . the strong stellar winds and radiation pressure of the massive stars in the cygnus region have strongly influenced the spatial distribution of the molecular gas in the region , displacing and compressing the gas forming filamentary structures and dense clumps which surround the less dense environment of the cluster , in which the gas has been evacuated .",
    "if high - energy particles are generated within the stellar associations , they can interact with the ultraviolet radiation fields producing tev gamma - rays through the inverse compton and p@xmath43 processes .",
    "however , protons and nuclei can travel longer distances than electrons , and they may also leave the photon dominated regions around the massive star clusters and interact with the nearby molecular clouds .",
    "the resulting neutrino flux map would then reflect the complicated distribution of the gas in the region .",
    "it is also worth noting that the injection of cosmic - rays may take place at multiple locations due to presence of several particle accelerators inside the cygnus region .",
    "the existence of these accelerators is confirmed by the observation of strong tev gamma - ray emission throughout an area of approximately @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the potential for icecube to observe neutrinos from this region has been discussed in @xcite , based on the measured tev gamma - ray flux .",
    "due to the complexity of the possible spatial distribution of events within the cygnus region , we have applied an analysis of the spatial correlations between neutrino events to search for an astrophysical neutrino signal in an extended region .",

    "there are two ways to identify active periods of cyg x-3 associated with jet ejection : the observation of a radio flux above 1 jy , following @xcite , and the observation of hyper - soft x - ray states and subsequent hardening of the x - ray spectrum , following @xcite .",
    "the identification of potential flaring periods of cyg x-3 is thus split into a radio and an x - ray part , as in table  [ cygx3_flares ] . for reconstruction of radio flares from x - ray data , an average radio flare was obtained from gaussians fitted to 28 flares seen to rise above 1  jy in radio data .",
    "one average radio flare was put at each time of potential radio flaring , as seen in x - ray data ( i.e. spectral hardness > 0.001 within 10 days after a state with hardness < 0.001 ) to obtain a pseudo radio flux density @xmath58 .",

    "this allows us to find neutrino emission that comes before or after a radio flare .",

    ", the identification of neutrino candidate events in the icecube and amanda data is based on the selection of well - reconstructed up - going events since the dominant background are muons from cosmic ray air - showers , which reach the detector in the downward direction but are filtered out by the earth in the upward direction , leaving only neutrinos .    the icecube and amanda data are divided into two streams which are treated in a similar way .",
    "the first stream are events that trigger amanda .",
    "as explained above , these events are then complemented with the data collected in icecube and for this reason they are considered as combined events ( c - events ) . the second stream",
    "are those events which trigger only icecube ( ico - events ) , either because the number of hits in amanda is below the trigger threshold or because amanda was not active at the time the event was recorded .",
    "initial fast track reconstructions and event selections are applied on - line at the south pole since the available bandwidth for satellite transfer of data is limited . for ico - events ,",
    "a straight track is fit to the data by minimizing the distance between the track and the hits ( linefit ) @xcite . for c - events , a pattern recognition algorithm ( called jams )",
    "has been used @xcite .",
    "the on - line filters are based on these reconstructions and the relevant events for the presented analysis are selected by requiring that the first - guess reconstruction is not down - going . at this level ,",
    "the data are still dominated by atmospheric muons that are mis - reconstructed as up - going .",
    "in particular , coincidences between multiple muons from different cosmic - ray air showers can mimic up - going event topologies .",
    "after transfer to the north , more sophisticated reconstructions are applied to improve the angular resolution and to provide quality parameters for the rejection of the down - going atmospheric muon background .",
    "these reconstructions are maximum likelihood fits which are based on the probability density function for the arrival time of a photon given the track hypothesis @xcite .",
    "two likelihood reconstructions have been studied : one based only on the first photon in each optical module ( spe ) and a more complete one which includes the possible presence of multiple photo electrons ( mpe ) . for more details about the spe and mpe reconstructions , we refer to @xcite . a list of variables that are indicative of the quality of the reconstructed event is given in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the track reconstruction itself , an estimate of the angular uncertainty of the track reconstruction is obtained for each individual event by the evaluation of the likelihood function near the maximum .",
    "this method is described in @xcite .",
    "the estimate of the angular uncertainty is used for the event selection as well as in the maximum likelihood ratio test .    in the ic40+a analysis",
    ", we also make use of an energy reconstruction which is based on the characterization of the energy loss along the particle track . at energies above a few hundred gev ,",
    "the energy loss of a muon in the ice is proportional to its energy .",
    "the energy reconstruction used in this work is presented in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to icecube , the waveforms collected with the optical modules of amanda are not digitized directly in the optical modules but are transferred to the surface as analog signals .",
    "this introduces two undesired effects in the data .",
    "the first one is crosstalk between different cables .",
    "large pulses in one optical module can cause a detectable signal within the electronics of cables connected to other optical modules .",
    "the second issue concerns the pickup of electromagnetic noise .",
    "the pmt signals have to be transferred over a distance between 1.5  km and 2.0  km to the surface .",
    "the cables needed for this task are vulnerable to pick up electromagnetic noise as they act as electromagnetic antennae .",
    "methods dedicated to the identification of non - particle induced signals based on the waveforms have been developed and result in an efficient separation from particle - induced signals .",
    "the integral over the entire collected waveform pulse is used in order to remove crosstalk pulses . since crosstalk pulses",
    "do not originate from a charge deposit in the pmt , they consist of ( positive and negative ) fluctuations around the baseline with the total integral close to zero .",
    "waveforms from a particle - induced signal in the pmt have a characteristic width , which is wider at the surface due to dispersion in the cables . for amanda strings 5 - 10 ,",
    "this is typically 250 - 300  ns for single photoelectrons ( spe ) .",
    "waveforms from multiple photoelectrons ( mpe ) result from the ( linear ) overlay of many spe waveforms and typically are wider than those .",
    "in contrast , noise - induced waveforms are often very spiky , i.e.  they have many peaks within the width corresponding to a typical spe pulse .",
    "this feature of non - particle - induced waveforms has been used to remove noisy events from the data : events which simultaneously have a median peak rate in the waveforms recorded in amanda strings 5 - 10 which is incompatible with a pmt signal ( above 5  mhz ) and a high number ( more than 20 ) of waveforms in these strings , are considered non - particle induced and are removed from the data set .",
    "figure  [ flarecheck ] illustrates this cut .",
    "both analyses presented in this paper first apply cross - talk cleaning and the above technique for rejection of non - particle induced events to the amanda data , before further event selections are made .",
    "data have been collected from may 31 , 2007 until april 4 , 2008 when icecube was operating in a 22-string configuration .",
    "the lifetime of the ic22+a run is 276  days , including 143  days of amanda operating in stable mode .",
    "the unusually long downtime of amanda during this period was caused by various hardware failures during may 2007 ( trigger system ) and during august 2007 ( high voltage supply system ) . in this section ,",
    "the event selection from the trigger level up to the final analysis level is described and the characteristics of the combined neutrino sample are highlighted .      as explained above , icecube and amanda",
    "are triggered separately in the combined detector mode .",
    "the trigger rate of ic22 is 550  hz , while amanda triggers at 200  hz .",
    "seasonal variations affect the trigger rate by about @xmath65 .",
    "the overall trigger rate of the combined ic22+a detector after correction for overlaps between the two triggers is 640  hz . at trigger level , the data are strongly dominated by down going atmospheric muons induced by cosmic - ray air showers outnumbering atmospheric neutrinos by a factor of about @xmath66 .",
    "the on - line filter reduces the data volume for satellite transfer and has a passing rate for reconstructed up - going or horizontal events of 22  hz for ico - events and 8  hz for c - events , producing a total event rate of 30  hz .",

    "a typical quality parameter used in this analysis is the number of un - scattered photons , so - called `` direct hits , '' which are characterized by a small time residual with respect to the expectation of the geometry of the emitted cherenkov cone .    in order to optimize the retention of lower energy events we have employed a multivariate approach . in this approach",
    ", a signal likelihood is defined as the product of the signal likelihood from the considered variables and is compared to the likelihood of the background hypothesis . according to the neyman - pearson lemma @xcite",
    ", this criterion leads to the best possible discrimination power for the given set of variables if there are no correlations between them .",
    "for correlated variables , as in our case , this criterion turns out to still be powerful .",
    "we use experimental data dominated by atmospheric muons to describe the background , and simulated neutrinos weighted to an atmospheric neutrino spectrum in order to model the signal .",
    "c - events and ico - events are treated independently here . for ico - events ,",
    "further cuts are used to reject coincident air shower muons .",
    "these cuts are based on the smoothness of the distribution of the hits along the track and on reconstructions performed on subsets of hits . for c - events ,",
    "the rate of coincident muons is significantly lower due to the smaller size of amanda .",
    "while a tighter time - window cleaning helped to further reject the coincident muons in the combined events stream , no dedicated cuts / reconstructions have been used to remove these .",
    "the final cuts were optimized for the best discovery potential , and finally tracks are selected if the angular resolution estimator returned a value lower than @xmath67 .",
    "a harder cut on this parameter did not lead to an improved discovery potential .",
    "the resulting neutrino sample contains about 1.8 times more events than the search presented in @xcite . in total ,",
    "8727 events are selected , of which 3430 are c - events .",
    "these event numbers correspond to a data rate of @xmath68 hz for ic22+a and to @xmath69 hz in ic22 only mode .",
    "the effective area of the ic22+a analysis is shown in figure  [ a_eff_ic22ama ] .",
    "below energies of a few tev , there is a strong improvement when including amanda , with respect to the performance of a low - energy optimized analysis using icecube only .",
    "the energy distribution of atmospheric neutrinos for this selection according to simulations is shown in figure  [ atm_e_ic22_ama ] .",
    "the estimated angular resolution is given by a median of @xmath70 for atmospheric neutrinos and @xmath71 for a crab - like spectrum .",
    "about @xmath65 of the final events are expected to be mis - reconstructed muon background .    the minimum detectable flux is more than an order of magnitude above the neutrino emission expected from the crab assuming that the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations are consistent with a model of @xmath72 interactions . while with this expectation , a positive detection is unlikely but not excluded as the photon flux may be absorbed , the analysis is valuable as a starting point for future improvements with the full icecube detector and the deepcore sub - detector . using an e@xmath2 spectrum for the comparison ,",
    "the discovery flux in this analysis is between 15% and 33% lower than the one in @xcite , depending on the declination .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the improvement obtained by the combined use of a low - energy core and the optimization of the event selection for softer spectra .",
    "an additional improvement is obtained by the lower number of trials in the galactic plane scan versus the scan of a hemisphere or the whole sky but is not quantified here .          following the explorative analysis strategy developed for the ic22+a",
    ", a similar analysis has been conducted on the larger data sample collected with the combined ic40+a detector from april 5 , 2008 to may 20 , 2009 . both parts of the combined icecube - amanda detector operated very stably during this time period .",
    "for ic40 about 375  days of data were collected and used in this analysis and for amanda about 306  days .",
    "the main causes for downtime were scheduled operations in the course of the integration of new strings into the detector . moreover",
    ", the decommissioning of amanda began a few weeks before the completion of the ic40 run .",
    "the event selection is in many aspects similar to the one applied to the ic22+a data as the targeted energy range is the same as well as the physics driving the analysis .",
    "again , different cut criteria are developed for c- and ico - events .      for what concerns",
    "this analysis , the trigger logic was kept identical to the one in the previous season . the on - line filter selected about 20  hz of track - like ico - events and 3  hz of up - going c - events .",
    "similar to the previous combined analysis , ico - events are selected by a series of one - dimensional cuts on event quality parameters and combined with a multivariate classification based on the neyman - pearson lemma @xcite .",
    "the probability density functions for five quality parameters are generated from down going atmospheric muon - dominated data as background and from up going atmospheric neutrino simulation as signal , and combined in the cut .",
    "( the fraction of atmospheric neutrino events in the data is still only about 4% and the data can therefore be regarded as dominated by background atmospheric muons . )",
    "the five quality parameters used in this analysis are : the quality parameter of the likelihood reconstruction , an estimate of the angular uncertainty of the likelihood reconstruction obtained by the evaluation of the likelihood space around the maximum , and three variables which describe the amount and distribution of unscattered light in the event .",
    "a pmt pulse from un - scattered light is characterized by a small time residual with respect to the expectation from the geometry of the cherenkov cone . the number of pmt pulses with time residuals between -15  ns and 75  ns , the maximum distance between their projections on the reconstructed track and the smoothness of their distribution along the track of the particle are used in the event selection .",
    "more information about these variables is reported in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the resulting cut variable is shown in figure  [ ic40ama_np ] for data and for atmospheric neutrino simulation as well as for two example signal neutrino spectra .",
    "an optimization of the discovery potential for a soft e@xmath2 spectrum results in an optimal cut value of 1.0 .",
    "c - events are first cleaned as described in section [ sec4.1 ] .",
    "subsequently , a series of one - dimensional cuts is applied .",
    "this series of cuts has been challenged versus other more sophisticated cut strategies and demonstrated to perform well enough in the separation of the atmospheric muon background and the neutrino signal .",
    "while the analysis is optimized for soft spectra such as e@xmath2 or the crab - spectrum , it is nevertheless desirable to retain a good efficiency for very high - energy neutrino events as well . with a cut optimized on a very soft spectrum however ,",
    "the retention of high - energy events is not necessarily optimal as these deposit much more light in the detector and may thus have event topologies that are not caught in the low - energy event selection . to remedy this ,",
    "additional criteria are included in the event selection if the signature is likely to be induced by a very high - energy neutrino .",
    "these additional events are selected in both streams with a series of one - dimensional cuts based among others on their reconstructed energy .",
    "the ic40+a analysis also uses maximum likelihood track reconstructions . for low energetic combined icecube - amanda events , a single photo electron ( spe ) pdf is used and for all other events , a multiple photoelectron ( mpe ) pdf is used .",

    "the purity of the atmospheric neutrino sample is estimated to be 97 - 98% .",

    "these analyses have been performed on data collected with two partial configurations of the icecube neutrino telescope operating in conjunction with its predecessor amanda . in the two data taking periods considered here , icecube operated in a 22-string and in a 40-string configuration , and amanda was an integrated part of icecube in both seasons .",
    "results from several searches have been presented .",
    "we have performed a scan of the galactic plane with the aim to discover point - like neutrino emission in the part of the milky way which is located in the northern hemisphere . since no significant local clustering of events has been observed , upper limits for soft - spectra neutrino emission from the galaxy have been reported .",
    "a search that is sensitive for many possible morphologies of neutrino emission , including for example the presence of several weak or extended sources , has been performed for the cygnus region of the galactic plane , yielding restrictive upper limits . both a strong tev gamma - ray source ( mgro j2019 + 37 ) and a tev diffuse component have been measured in the cygnus region with the milagro detector from the area defined by galactic latitude @xmath153 and galactic longitude @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the diffuse flux has been measured by milagro over a region of @xmath150.02  sr and the total gamma - ray flux ( diffuse and mgro j2019 + 37 ) measured by milagro accounts for @xmath155 tev cm@xmath1 s@xmath157 at 12  tev assuming a differential source spectrum of e@xmath117 . under the hypothesis that the region is transparent to gamma - rays",
    ", the milagro measurements can be used to estimate the maximal , associated neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "assuming that all the high - energy gamma - rays reported by milagro come from decays of @xmath158 produced in proton - proton interactions , and using the same e@xmath117 spectrum adopted in @xcite , the upper limits derived from the ic40+a analysis are only a factor of @xmath152 @xcite above this estimate of the maximal neutrino flux from inside the cygnus region .",
    "this implies that icecube has the potential to detect neutrinos or to constrain the nature of the gamma - ray emission in one of the most active parts of the galaxy in the next few years .",
    "finally , a dedicated time - optimized search from the direction of the binary system cygnus x-3 has been performed based on multi - wavelength observations .",
    "upper limits for neutrino emission during specific episodes of enhanced radio and x - ray activity have been determined for this binary system .",
    "we have presented the first neutrino point source searches which use a more densely instrumented sub - array inside a large neutrino telescope .",
    "the capability to improve the performance in the energy range below @xmath010  tev in this way has been demonstrated . using this capability ,",
    "we have for the first time optimized a search for neutrino point sources particularly for the more steeply falling energy spectra expected for galactic neutrino sources .",
    "amanda , the sub - array used in this work , has been decommissioned in 2009 and is now succeded by icecube - deepcore @xcite , an advanced low - energy extension of icecube .",
    "the searches presented here have demonstrated that it is possible to improve the sensitivity to galactic sources with early energy cut - offs and steeper spectra than e@xmath1 using a denser core array even at the expense of a larger atmospheric neutrino background . as a detector specifically built to enhance the sensitivity of icecube at low energies ,",
    "deepcore is positioned in the deep center of the detector where the ice is clearest .",
