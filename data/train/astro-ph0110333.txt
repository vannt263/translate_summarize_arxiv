    "it has been known for some time now that a handful of galactic x - ray transients has exhibited radio jets .",
    "the first x - ray binary for which a kinematic model involving radio jets was proposed to explain its bizarre observed spectrum was ss  433 in 1979 ( abell & margon 1979 ) .",
    "subsequently , in 1994 , apparent superluminal motion of ejected material was observed for the first time in our galaxy from grs  1915@xmath1105 ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) . the velocity of the ejecta was estimated to be 0.92@xmath2 for an assumed distance of 12.5  kpc . since that first discovery",
    ", four other _ transients _ have shown apparent superluminal motion : gro  j1655@xmath040 ( hjellming & rupen 1994 ; tingay et al .",
    "1995 ) ; xte  j1748@xmath0288 ( rupen , hjellming & mioduszewski 1998 ; v4641  sgr ( hjellming et al .",
    "2000 ) ; and xte  j1550@xmath0564 ( hannikainen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to the transient jet sources , there has also been evidence of steady compact radio jets during the low hard state of galactic black hole candidate x - ray binaries from , for example , cyg  x-1 ( stirling et al .",
    "2001 ) and 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 , or `` the great annihilator '' ( e.g. mirabel et al . 1992",
    "; see fender 2001 for a full review on radio jets from x - ray binaries in the low hard state ) .",
    "the presence of jets in x - ray binaries gives rise to radio emission and in this paper we will take the observation of radio emission to indicate the presence of jets .",
    "note however , that in the absence of resolved radio observations , this emission may also stem from other regions within the source .",
    "the composition of the jets , either electron - positron or electron - proton plasma , is still not fully established .",
    "for example , gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini ( 1999 ) investigated the role of electron - positron pairs ( amongst other possibilities ) as energy carriers from the inner jet regions , and have excluded a pair plasma as a viable possibility .",
    "they argue that either hot or cold pairs can not survive the annihilation .",
    "in this paper we propose that the annihilation line features observed in the hard x - ray spectra of some x - ray transients arise from pairs in a bipolar outflow . at the time of annihilation , this outflow is already accelerated to relativistic bulk speeds causing a significant doppler shift of the frequency of the annihilation lines .",
    "we also show that the subsequent emission of radio synchrotron radiation from the outflow may be caused by only a small fraction of pairs escaping from the annihilation region .",
    "we apply this idea to radio and hard x - ray observations of nova muscae 1991 , thus constraining the properties of the possible outflow from this system . the energy requirements for this source rule out a large contribution of protons to the outflow .",
    "we would like to point out that 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 has exhibited annihilation features near 511  kev ( e.g. mandrou et al . 1990 ) , and that there is some evidence of the same in cyg  x-1 ( ling & wheaton 1989 ) .",
    "we are currently working on expanding the arguments presented in this paper to encompass the other two sources ( hannikainen & kaiser , in preparation ) .    in section [ sec : dop ]",
    "we discuss under which plasma conditions we can expect doppler - shifted annihilation lines .",
    "section [ sec : sync ] briefly reviews radio synchrotron emission . the case of nova muscae 1991 is investigated in section [ sec : nm ] and in section [ sec : conc ] we summarise our results .",
    "the direct annihilation of an electron - positron pair results in the production of two @xmath3-ray photons , each with an energy of 511kev in the rest - frame of the annihilating particles . in the case of a hot pair plasma",
    "the resulting emission line is broadened by the random thermal motion of the pairs ( ramaty & mszros 1981 ) . also , the annihilation of a thermal pair plasma is accompanied by bremsstrahlung from the pairs .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity around 511kev exceeds that of the annihilation process at temperatures above @xmath4 ( svensson 1982 ; macioek - niedwiecki , zdziarski & coppi 1995 , hereafter mzc95 ) .",
    "below a temperature of about @xmath5k the annihilation proceeds via the formation of positronium leading to a distinctive low - energy wing of the annihilation line ( e.g. longair 1994 ) .",
    "thus in the case of a thermal pair plasma the plasma temperature must lie roughly in the range @xmath5k to @xmath6k for a narrow annihilation line to be observable .    in a plasma",
    ", pairs may be produced by various mechanisms . unless there is a strong external radiation field containing many photons with energies in excess of 511kev ,",
    "all of these require the presence of highly energetic electrons and soft seed photons .",
    "the electrons upscatter the soft photons beyond the pair creation threshold and thus the plasma starts producing pairs . as a by - product of the pair production , a strong comptonization spectrum is emitted by the plasma .",
    "mzc95 point out that this comptonization spectrum completely swamps the annihilation line in thermal plasmas .",
    "an observable narrow line can only be produced if a large fraction of the pairs escapes from the plasma and has time to cool before annihilating .",
    "however , this implies the existence of a rather sharp boundary between a fairly hot pair plasma bathed in an intense radiation field of soft photons and a region virtually devoid of any soft photons . also , although the pairs escape the plasma , the volume containing the pairs must be confined at least for a time longer than the cooling time .",
    "any expansion would lead to enormously reduced annihilation rates .",
    "although it is certainly possible to construct such geometries , the existence of non - thermal leptons within the plasma allows for a simpler way of producing a narrow annihilation line .    in non - thermal plasmas",
    "relativistic electrons or pairs may be injected into the plasma .",
    "the injected pairs and those produced in the plasma may cool to sub - relativistic energies and thermalize before annihilating , thus leading to a narrow annihilation line ( lightman & zdziarski 1987 , hereafter lz87 ) . if the line is strong , it can rise above the comptonization spectrum and becomes detectable .",
    "this requires a high pair yield , @xmath7 , defined as the ratio of the energy converted to pairs and the energy supplied to the plasma .",
    "the highest pair yields can be achieved when the plasma is ` photon - starved ' , i.e. when the number of injected relativistic photons strongly exceeds that of the injected soft photons ( zdziarski , coppi & lamb 1990 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath8 and a strong , narrow annihilation line above the comptonization continuum becomes observable .",
    "we conclude that the observation of a narrow annihilation line most likely indicates a plasma with strong injection of non - thermal electrons or pairs .",
    "the injection of leptons into a spherical volume of radius @xmath9 is characterised by the compactness ( e.g. lz87 )    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath12 is the power of the electron injection ,    @xmath13    here , @xmath14 is the rate of injection of leptons with lorentz factor @xmath3 per unit volume per unit time per unit @xmath3 .",
    "if the compactness @xmath15 can be inferred from the observations of an annihilation line , then equations  ( [ compact ] ) and ( [ luminosity ] ) can be used to constrain @xmath14 .",
    "any emission of relativistically moving material is doppler - shifted in its frequency . for material moving with bulk velocity @xmath16 at an angle @xmath17 to the line of sight to the observer , the observed frequency , @xmath18 , of radiation emitted at frequency @xmath19 in the rest - frame of the material is given as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the velocity @xmath22 ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the upper signs correspond to material receding along the line of sight to the observer while the lower signs indicate approaching material . from equation  ( [ delta ] ) it is clear that radiation of material receding from an observer is always redshifted .",
    "however , for approaching material the emission may be blueshifted or redshifted , depending on the combination of @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : doppler ] shows this effect for the example of positron annihilation radiation emitted at a rest - frame energy of 511kev .",
    "any combination of @xmath22 and @xmath17 below the dashed line in this figure corresponds to redshifted emission from the approaching material .",
    "the range of velocities which result in such a doppler redshift is largest for angles to the line of sight close to @xmath23 .",
    "for a source with a bipolar outflow with components travelling in opposite directions there will always be one approaching and one receding component .",
    "if both components emit a strong annihilation line , we expect to observe two such lines at frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 . assuming the same bulk velocity for both components , equation  ( [ delta ] ) can then be solved for the bulk velocity of the components ,    @xmath26    and for the angle of the bulk velocity to the line of sight    @xmath27    where again the upper signs correspond to the receding component and the lower signs to the approaching one .    in practice",
    "it may be difficult to observe the annihilation line from the receding component as this will be strongly deboosted .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the line fluxes provides for an independent check on the quantity @xmath28 as ( rybicki & lightman 1979 )    @xmath29    with @xmath30 for discrete components and @xmath31 for continuous jets .",
    "it is usually difficult to determine the line fluxes accurately from observations .",
    "this , combined with the ambiguity of the value of @xmath32 , implies that the line flux ratio is of limited use .",
    "synchrotron emission arises from relativistic electrons and/or positrons spiralling in a magnetic field .",
    "it is usually described by a power law spectrum with @xmath33 .",
    "both the relativistic particles and the magnetic field store energy , but how the total energy is divided between the two can not be determined from the observed radiation alone .",
    "however , it is well known that there is a minimum total energy required to produce a given monochromatic synchrotron luminosity , @xmath34 .",
    "this is usually expressed in terms of the magnetic field corresponding to this condition    @xmath35^{2/7 } , \\label{bmin}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the volume of the emitting region and @xmath37 is a numerical constant depending on the slope of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath38 , and on @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the limits of the spectrum .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath41mhz and @xmath42ghz .",
    "note here that the exact choice for the spectral cut - offs , and particularly the choice for @xmath43 , has very little influence on the value of @xmath37 for @xmath44 , typical for optically thin synchrotron radiation ( e.g. longair 1994 ) .",
    "the energy in the relativistic particles is then given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the number of relativistic particles with lorentz factor @xmath3 per unit volume per unit @xmath3 .",
    "for a given synchrotron luminosity and a known volume of the emission region we can therefore constrain @xmath46 . obviously , this is just an estimate as the distribution of the energy between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field may depart strongly from the minimum energy values .",
    "however , such a departure would lead to much higher overall energy requirements .",
    "the estimates presented above implicitly assume that the emission region is optically thin to radio waves .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , particularly in the inner , dense regions of the source . for @xmath47",
    "the optical depth is    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a function of @xmath50 only ( e.g. longair 1994 ) and @xmath9 is the typical path length photons have to travel through the emission region .",
    "if the magnetic field is tangled on scales significantly smaller than the physical size of the emission region , its energy density obeys @xmath51 .",
    "so for a spherical volume of radius @xmath9 and @xmath52 we find    @xmath53",
    "nova muscae ( grs 1124@xmath0684 ) was discovered on 1991  january  8 by granat ( lund & brandt 1991 ; sunyaev 1991 ) and ginga ( makino 1991 ) .",
    "an extensive monitoring campaign with granat covering most of january and february 1991 followed this initial discovery ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter gsc91 ; sunyaev et al . 1992 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "1993 ) . during observations on january  2021 , a strong , narrow line near",
    "500 kev was detected .",
    "this line had not been noted before and the line flux was observed to increase during the observation within the space of a few hours .",
    "unfortunately , the observations stopped before the line flux decreased again , implying a lifetime of the line emission of at least 10 hours . during subsequent observations on february  12",
    "it was not detected .",
    "simultaneously to the strong line near 500 kev , there was also increased emission detected near 200 kev . the spectrum obtained with granat during 1991  january  2021",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : xspec ] .",
    "gsc91 fitted the spectrum with a power - law continuum and two gaussian line profiles .",
    "the lines peak at @xmath54kev and @xmath55kev .",
    "the line fluxes are given as @xmath56photons s@xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59photons s@xmath57 @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the fwhm of the line centred at 474kev is @xmath60kev .",
    "the original discovery also triggered a radio monitoring programme using the molongolo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at frequencies ranging from 843mhz to 8.6ghz ( kesteven & turtle 1991 ; ball et al .",
    "the campaign started on january  17 and continued into early february .",
    "the radio lightcurve at 843mhz obtained with the most is shown in figure  [ fig : most ] .",
    "ball et al . (",
    "1995 ) note four distinct features in the lightcurve .",
    "there is a general decay of the radio flux from the very beginning of the programme continuing until about january  22 .",
    "this is interrupted by a brief flare around january  18 observed with atca ( not shown in figure  [ fig : most ] ) .",
    "there is another flare observed from january  31 until around february  5 .",
    "finally , a short flare was observed by most at 843mhz on january  24 with a measured flux density of 24mjy .",
    "the event lasted only one day .",
    "there were no observations at other frequencies .    in the following we will concentrate on the detection of the @xmath3-ray lines on january  21 and the brief radio flare on january  24 .",
    "we speculate that the same ejection event is responsible for the emission at opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum observed on the two days .",
    "we assume here that the two @xmath3-ray lines observed in the spectrum of nova muscae arise from pair annihilation in a relativistic bipolar outflow from the very centre of the system . in this model ,",
    "the line at 474kev is associated with the approaching component while that at 194kev arises from the receding component .",
    "using equations  ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ cos ] ) we then find @xmath61 for the angle to the line of sight of the component motion and @xmath62 for the bulk velocity of the components .",
    "this corresponds to a lorentz factor of @xmath63 .",
    "the errors are determined from the uncertainties in the frequency of the line peaks as given by gsc91 . with these values",
    "we expect the ratio of the line fluxes of the approaching and the receding components to be @xmath64 for discrete components and @xmath65 for continuous jets ( see equation  [ fluxratio ] ) .",
    "the observed line fluxes give @xmath66 .",
    "the velocity and angle to the line of sight calculated from the frequencies of the line peaks are consistent with this within the errors . however , the uncertainties are very large .",
    "the companion star in nova muscae is tidally distorted by the black hole .",
    "the resulting variation in the lightcurve has been modelled by orosz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who constrain the inclination of the system to @xmath67 , and also by shahbaz , naylor & charles ( 1997 ) who find @xmath68 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath69 is also the inclination angle of the accretion disc around the black hole and that the bipolar outflow moves in a direction perpendicular to this disc .",
    "however , note that the jets in gro j1655 - 40 appear to be misaligned with respect to the direction perpendicular to the disc ( e.g. orosz & baylin 1997 ) . with these assumptions",
    "we should find @xmath70 , i.e. the angle of the outflow direction to the line of sight is equal to the inclination of the system .",
    "our value for @xmath17 is fully consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we now take a closer look at the profile of the line centred at 474kev .",
    "the line at 194kev is too weak to allow any detailed investigation of its profile , and hence we only fit the line at 474kev for this present study .",
    "the fwhm of the line at 474kev is only 70kev which implies a pair temperature of only about @xmath71k at the time of annihilation ( ramaty & mszros 1981 ; gsc91 ) .",
    "the rate of annihilation implied by the line flux is @xmath72pairs s@xmath57 for a distance of 5.5kpc ( orosz et al .",
    "this enormous rate is sustained for at least 10 hours ( sunyaev et al .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that this feature at 474  kev arises from a large number of pairs formed practically instantaneously and then slowly annihilating away .",
    "this would imply a short - lived flash of annihilation photons with a fast , exponential decay contrary to the lifetime of the annihilation features of at least 10 hours .",
    "a more promising approach is to assume that the pair producing plasma is in equilibrium , i.e. the annihilation losses are balanced by pair creation .",
    "mzc95 failed to fit the line with such a model assuming a thermal plasma with strong pair escape .",
    "they also tried a model with injection of non - thermal electrons based on the work of lz87 .",
    "again , the fit was poor .",
    "however , they did not take into account a possible doppler - redshift of the line .",
    "after correcting the spectrum for the redshift derived above , we attempted a fit essentially identical to that of mzc95 .",
    "we used the model nteea within the xspec package which is an implementation of the model developed in lz87 .",
    "we disabled any contribution to the spectrum by reflection off the disc .",
    "the temperature of the black body providing the soft seed photons for the pair creation process was set to 1kev which gives a reasonable fit to the low energy spectrum of nova muscae ( see mzc95 ) .",
    "further , we assumed that there was no thermal heating of the plasma , no escape of pairs from the source and that the optical depth due to protons was zero .",
    "the energy spectrum of the injected relativistic electrons was described by @xmath73 , extending from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "we have chosen the slope of the power law to be equal to that of the radio emission ( see section [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "variation of this parameter as well as changing @xmath76 and @xmath77 was found to cause only minor differences in the result .",
    "finally , the model assumes that the plasma is contained within a spherical volume .",
    "the radius of this we set to @xmath78 m corresponding to the schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass @xmath79m@xmath80 .",
    "this is the minimum conceivable size of the annihilation region . in any case",
    ", the exact value of @xmath9 is only important for the determination of energy losses due to coulomb and bremsstrahlung processes . it does not significantly influence the model fit of the annihilation line .",
    "the only free parameters in this fit were the compactness of the non - thermal electron injection , @xmath15 , and the compactness of injected soft photons , @xmath81 .",
    "the latter is defined to be analogous to @xmath82 with @xmath12 in equation  ( [ compact ] ) replaced by the luminosity of the soft photon injection .",
    "as we were only interested in fitting the annihilation line at 474kev , we only used data points in the range 195699  kev .",
    "we also excluded all negative flux measurements within this range which resulted in 23 data points to be fitted .",
    "figure  [ fig : xspec ] shows our best fit with a reduced @xmath83-value of 1.35 ( for 84  d.o.f ) .",
    "the free parameters , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , imply a strongly photon - starved plasma .",
    "the parameters are not well constrained as under these conditions the pair yield does not depend strongly on their exact values ( e.g. lz87 ) .",
    "we find a lower limit for @xmath15 of about 100 , below which the pair yield is too small to give a good fit . despite these uncertainties",
    ", the correction of the data for a doppler - redshift clearly makes a reasonable fit of the annihilation line possible .",
    "re - arranging equation  ( [ compact ] ) yields    @xmath86    substituting in our lower limits for @xmath9 and @xmath15 , we find @xmath87w . from equation  ( [ luminosity ] ) it follows that @xmath88m@xmath89 s@xmath57 for this lower limit .",
    "the rate at which relativistic electrons are injected is then @xmath90particles s@xmath57 .",
    "this is comparable to the observed annihilation rate of @xmath91particles s@xmath57 .",
    "the radio flare occured on 1991  january  24 , about three days after the observation of the annihilation lines .",
    "if this emission arose from the same material that was responsible for the annihilation features at the very centre of the source , then these ejection components were by then located roughly @xmath92 m further out .",
    "this assumes that the components did not decelerate . when resolved in the radio ,",
    "the ejections of x - ray transients are quite collimated ( e.g. mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) . in order to estimate the size of the radio - emitting region , we assume a half - opening angle of the ejection of @xmath93 .",
    "this implies a radius of @xmath94 m for a spherical component .",
    "the measured flux density was @xmath95mjy at 843mhz which we associate entirely with the approaching component .",
    "for the values found in section [ sec : anni ] for the bulk velocity , @xmath96 , and the angle to the line of sight , @xmath97 , this converts to 29.9mjy emitted at 909mhz in the rest frame of the approaching component .",
    "this assumes a discrete component rather than a continuous jet .",
    "we have no information on the slope of the radio spectrum for 24 january .",
    "therefore , we adopted a spectral index of @xmath98 as derived from the multi - frequency observations of the earlier flares .",
    "this implies that @xmath99 . for a distance to the source of 5.5kpc ( orosz et al .",
    "1996 ) and using equation  ( [ bmin ] ) , we find the magnetic field strength correponding to minimum energy conditions to be @xmath100mt .",
    "using equation  ( [ wpart ] ) this implies @xmath101j and @xmath102 m@xmath89 .",
    "the number of relativistic particles in the emitting volume is @xmath103 .",
    "adopting the radius of the emission region at the time of the observation as a scale radius @xmath104 m , equation  ( [ depth ] ) for the optical depth at @xmath105mhz yields    @xmath106      the annihilation feature observed persists for at least 10 hours ( sunyaev et al .",
    "the production of an outflow must have lasted at least for that length of time . in the case of a shorter ejection event",
    "the annihilation rate would decrease dramatically as the ejected material travels outwards and expands .",
    "of course , the annihilation could also proceed in a region close to the centre of the source without moving outwards . in this case , the displacement of the line at 474kev could be explained as arising from gravitational redshift .",
    "this requires the annihilation region to be inside about 7 schwarzschild radii of the 6m@xmath80 black hole .",
    "however , in this case it is not clear what causes the second , simultaneous line at 194kev .",
    "an entirely different explanation for the line at 474kev is given by gsc91 and also by martn et al .",
    "this involves the emission of @xmath3-ray photons of energy 468kev during the formation of @xmath107li close to the black hole .",
    "this is supported by the observation of optical lithium lines .",
    "however , gsc91 point out that the proximity of the lithium production region to the black hole should result in a strong rotational broadening of the line .",
    "furthermore , the secondary line at 194kev is again not explained in this scenario .    misra & melia ( 1993 ) presented a model for electron - positron pair jets to explain the annihilation line observed in the spectrum of the galactic centre source 1e 1740.7 - 2942 .",
    "their model is based on a radiative acceleration mechanism for the jets .",
    "the great majority of pairs annihilate within the acceleration zone with a large variation in the thermal pair temperature .",
    "this leads to the formation of quite a broad line . also , as mentioned before ,",
    "a model with purely thermal pairs is unable to account for the annihilation line in the case of nova muscae ( mzc95 ) . in the model presented here",
    "we argue that the bulk of the outflow containing the pairs is already accelerated when they annihilate , thus explaining the redshifts of the two observed lines .",
    "the velocity of the outflow is then 0.84c , while the radiative acceleration allows only for a terminal velocity of about 0.7c . because of this , the acceleration of the outflow must , at least partly , be due to some other mechanism(s ) .",
    "the energy required to drive the outflows is enormous .",
    "as the relativistic electrons necessary for pair production are highly relativistic , their mass in the rest frame of the outflow material is given by @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the total kinetic power of the relativistic electrons , as measured in the source rest frame , injected into the outflow can be approximated as    @xmath109    in this estimate we have used the limiting values for the electron compactness , @xmath110 , and the size of the emission region , @xmath111 m . any increase in these parameters will also cause the energy estimate to rise . therefore , the lower limit on @xmath112 corresponds already to about 80% of the eddington luminosity of a 6m@xmath80 black hole .",
    "balance of electrical charge requires the presence of positively charged particles in the outflow .",
    "if these are protons with negligible thermal energy but travelling at the necessary bulk velocity , then another @xmath113w in kinetic energy are required .",
    "this is more than a factor 50 more than the eddington luminosity .",
    "this energy injection into the outflow has to be sustained for more than 10 hours and thus makes a large proton content in the jet very unlikely .",
    "the only alternative is then that from the very beginning of the ejection the outflow material in the annihilation region consists of virtually a pure pair plasma .",
    "this removes the requirement of relatively inefficient pair production from relativistic electrons .",
    "the pairs must be injected into the relativistic bulk flow with a relativistic velocity distribution to explain the strength of the annihilation line ( mcz95 ) , the cooling within the outflow and then annihilation at a rate of @xmath114s@xmath57 . in this case , the required kinetic power is about @xmath115w , or 8% of the eddington luminosity .",
    "assuming that the outflows consist entirely of pairs , at least @xmath116 pairs are injected into the outflow approaching us .",
    "most of these annihilate but a small fraction may escape the annihilation region . if the radio flare discussed above is associated with the annihilation line feature and the radio - emitting region only contains the relativistic pairs required by minimum energy arguments , then only one in 7000 pairs need escape . in the model of misra & melia ( 1993 ) , roughly 10% of all pairs escape , which would imply a large thermal population underlying the radio - emitting relativistic pairs .",
    "nevertheless , the kinetic energy of this thermal population is , at @xmath117j , small compared to the kinetic energy of @xmath118j of the relativistic and therefore heavy radio - emitting particles . in any case , the energy required to explain the radio observations is at most only a fraction of 5% of the originally injected energy .",
    "thus the radio emission observed in x - ray transients may represent only an almost negligible fraction of the energy initially available to the outflow .",
    "the time between the detection of the annihilation line features from nova muscae and the first observations of a radio flare is roughly three days . during this time , a number of observations at various frequencies showed no sign of enhanced radio emission ( ball et al .",
    "this would argue against a connection between the two events .",
    "however , equation  ( [ depth2 ] ) shows that the outflow became optically thin to emission around 1ghz only when @xmath119 . for a constant opening angle of the outflows",
    "as assumed throughout , this implies that radio observations would have detected this flare only two days after its start at the earliest .",
    "the existence of highly relativistic electrons far out from the centre of the source implies a secondary acceleration mechanism .",
    "the annihilation line at 474kev is consistent with a pair temperature of only 5kev .",
    "therefore the escaping pairs are sub - relativistic and must be re - accelerated to explain the radio emission .",
    "one possibility is the existence of internal shocks within the outflow ( e.g. kaiser , sunyaev & spruit 2000 ) .",
    "the duration of the outflow production is easily long enough to allow for variations in the outflow speed which may lead to the formation of such shocks .",
    "alternatively , the particles may be re - accelerated at a working surface at the end of the flow , as is the case in many extragalactic jet sources .",
    "from the above discussion it is likely that nova muscae underwent a number of bursts resulting in relativistic outflows .",
    "the production of these outflows would then always be accompanied by strong annihilation line emission followed by radio synchrotron emission a few days later .",
    "here we are assuming that the radio emission arises in jets .",
    "unfortunately , only one of the rather minor outbursts of nova muscae in 1991 was covered by both @xmath3-ray and radio observations . the strongest outburst leading to the first detection of the system on 1991  january  8",
    "was observed with insufficient energy resolution to establish the presence of an annihilation line .",
    "subsequent high - resolution observations on january  9 did not detect any lines .",
    "there were two more minor radio bursts .",
    "one of them occurred on january  18 and a longer burst started around january  31 ( ball et al .",
    "if the three days delay between the appearance of the annihilation lines and the start of the radio emission is typical , then the two radio flares should have been preceeded by annihilation lines on january  15 and around january  28 respectively .",
    "there were no @xmath3-ray observations during the period from january  11 until january  16 and from january  22 until february  1 ( gsc91 ) .",
    "the non - detections of january  9 and january  16 may be taken as evidence that the outflow production , when it occurs , is rather short - lived .    if it is true that the annihilation features observed originate from accelerated plasma , then protons as a contributing factor to the matter in the plasma are ruled out .",
    "the scenario we have discussed favors a pair plasma  even if only a tiny fraction of the pairs survives , this is sufficient to produce the observed radio emission .",
    "furthermore , the detection of doppler - shifted annihilation lines is a direct method , independent of uncertainties arising from other observational parameters such as fluxes , by which to directly measure jet speeds .",
    "however , to confirm the outflow scenario linking @xmath3-ray line observations with radio emission , further detailed , time - resolved observations are needed .",
    "the spectral and temporal resolution of integral will enable the detection and follow the evolution of possible annihilation features in other jet sources .",
    "this will prove extremely valuable in the case of , for example , grs  1915@xmath1105 which is heavily obscured at visible wavelengths . in addition , this study was applied to nova muscae which is a transient , and hence it will be interesting to observe the behaviour of permanent jet sources , such as 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 , from which an annihilation line has already been detected .",

    "it is also a pleasure to thank andrzej zdziarski for help with nteea .",
