    "fundamental condensed - matter studies @xcite , had propelled us into the present modelling , since they have predicted the modification of the effective potential in the electronic case . here",
    "the key lies in the fact , that the potential - energy profile distribution in either of the binary - alloy slab might evolve , depending on the value of the transversal component of the wave vector @xcite . with respect to the electrons quantum transport through layered heterostructures ,",

    "( a ) of fig.[f2 - 3d ] , we observed a reduction of the effective _ band offset _ for _ lh _ ( red lines ) , similar to that of a _ gaas_-_alas_-_gaas _ heterostructure [ see fig.[f1 - 3d](a ) ] .",
    "however , the panel ( b ) of fig.[f2 - 3d ] illustrates a particularly different behavior for _ hh _ ( blue lines ) , due to a decrease of the energy edge for both left and right cladding - layers . a more explicit representation of that ,",
    "is shown in fig.[f3 - 2d](c ) .",
    "concerning results of all panels in fig.[f3 - 2d ] , we found useful to underline the coincidence for @xmath3 profile as well as for _ band offset _ along [ 10 ] ( solid line ) and [ 01 ] ( dashed - dotted line ) , in - plane directions .",
    "the last is a clear evidence of a partial isotropic behavior for the overlapped lines . from fig.[f3 - 2d](c ) , it can be noticed , how @xmath3 diminishes its lower - edge profile down to @xmath55 ev roughly , along the [ 11 ] in - plane direction ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "meanwhile , the upper - edge profile evolution plotted in fig.[f3 - 2d](c ) , goes on nearly constant along the same direction . on the other hand , in this kind of heterostructure ,",
    "the in - plane full - isotropic performance of @xmath3 evolution , is absence .",
    "this fact is observed from panels ( c)-(d ) of fig.[f3 - 2d ] .",
    "however , it can be assumed again a rectangular - like distribution of @xmath53 ( [ veff-0 ] ) for _ hh _ ( blue lines ) , as an acceptable reference frame along the [ 10 ] ( solid line ) and [ 01 ] ( dashed - dotted line ) , in - plane directions .",
    "moreover , notice that the difference between profile edges [ see fig.[f3 - 2d](d ) ] is less than @xmath56 ev at the higher @xmath1 value , respect to the zero hole - mixing point . concerning the same in - plane directions , worthwhile to underline that for _ lh _ ,",
    "a slightly reduced @xmath3 profile progression , stays as trend [ see fig.[f3 - 2d](a ) , red solid line ] .",
    "notice at panel fig.[f3 - 2d](b ) , that the @xmath3 _ band offset _ evolves up to @xmath57 ev along [ 10 ] and [ 01 ] in - plane directions at maximum @xmath1 , while it reduces almost to @xmath58 ev for the [ 11 ] interface orientation .",
    "figure [ f4 - 3d ] plots the evolution of @xmath3 for a _",
    "gan_-_alsb_-_gan _ layered heterostructure .",
    "in the presence of nitrides in the external layers , the noticeable increment of the effective _ band offset _ for _ lh _ ( red lines ) observed in panel ( a ) of fig.[f4 - 3d ] , contrasts with the reduction we had shown in panel ( a ) of fig.[f3 - 2d ] for non - nitride alloys .",
    "meanwhile in this case , the _ hh _ ( blue lines ) feel a similar distribution as in _ gaas_-_alas_-_gaas _ heterostructure ( see figure [ f1 - 3d ] ) .    for the sake of illustration",
    ", we retrieve a procedure that relies on a robust classical control theory technique , a so - called root locus @xcite . once we have quoted the eigenvalues @xmath59 of ( [ polinom ] ) , it is then straightforward to generate a plot in the complex plane , symbolizing the locations of @xmath59 values that rise as a band mixing parameter @xmath1 changes .",
    "we take advantage of the root - locus - like know - how , to promptly identify evanescent modes , keeping in mind that complex ( or pure imaginary ) solutions are displayed in the up(down)-half plane ( see figure [ f5-spectra ] ) .",
    "these values are forbidden for some layers and represent unstable solutions , underlining the lack of hospitality of these slabs for oscillating modes . although not shown here ,",
    "the opposite examination is also suitable for propagating modes , which become patterned in left(right)-half plane , and are equated with stable solutions for given layers .",
    "thus we are able `` to stamp '' on a @xmath60-map language , the stability domain analysis of the envisioned heterostructure under a quantum - transport problem .",
    "this way , we are presenting an unfamiliar methodology to deal with solid - state low - dimensional physical phenomenology .",
    "we present an alternative procedure to simulate graphically , the phenomenon of the transverse degree of freedom dependence of the effective scattering potential . for low - intensity valence - band mixing regime , a fixed - height rectangular distribution of the potential - energy , is a good trial as a standard reference frame , for a theoretical treatment involving both flavors of holes in the materials under study",
    ". however , this assertion is no longer valid for light holes , whenever the mixing effects reveal , and a mutable effective _ band offset _ profile has to be taken into account , whenever the in - plane kinetic energy changes .",
    "meanwhile , for heavy holes the effective _ band offset _ profile assumed at @xmath2 remains robust for finite values of valence - band mixing .",
    "evidences of this sort , are relevant in experimental applications , and in theoretical analysis of coupled - hole tunneling .",
