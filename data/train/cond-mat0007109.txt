    "it is fortunate that in physics the same equations sometimes arise in contexts that are apparently very different .",
    "feynman illustrates this through elementary examples in his introductory lectures on physics to impart the lesson that the `` same equations have the same solutions '' @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to study a model , recently dubbed the @xmath1model , that provides another such instance .",
    "the @xmath1model has been used to describe the merging of tributaries to form rivers @xcite ; the aggregation of diffusing charges @xcite ; the flow of stress in a granular medium @xcite ; and can be mapped onto the abelian sandpile , a model studied in context of self - organised criticality @xcite .",
    "it is also closely related to models that describe the surface of a quantum hall multilayer @xcite and passive scalar turbulence @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the application to granular matter , river networks and the quantum hall multilayer .",
    "granular matter exhibits fascinating behaviour that is little understood @xcite .",
    "examples of granular matter include sand , powders and agricultural grains stored in silos .",
    "an important problem is the propagation of stress through a granular medium at rest .",
    "this has been studied by ingenious experiments , in which a vertical load is applied to an amorphous pack of beads , and the loads on the beads in the top and bottom layers are recorded using carbon paper @xcite .",
    "such experiments yield the distribution of load on the beads and reveal that there are no horizontal correlations in load even amongst neighbouring beads .",
    "the @xmath0-model was introduced by coppersmith and coworkers to account for the distribution of load @xcite . as we shall see",
    ", it also correctly predicts the lack of horizontal correlation .    for simplicity",
    "we describe the @xmath0-model in a plane .",
    "since the vertical and horizontal directions are treated asymmetrically we call this the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath0-model .",
    "the extension to 2 + 1 dimensions ( relevant to experiments on bead packs ) and higher , is straightforward and is discussed in section v. in the @xmath0-model it is assumed that the beads sit on a regular lattice shown in fig 1 .",
    "the location of the beads is specified by the co - ordinates @xmath2 ( the depth of the layer ) and @xmath3 ( the location of the bead within the layer ) .",
    "note that @xmath3 takes only even values for @xmath2 even ; only odd , for @xmath2 odd .",
    "each bead is assumed to be supported by its two nearest neighbours in the layer directly below .",
    "more precisely , it is assumed that a random fraction @xmath4 of the load of bead @xmath5 is supported by the neighbour to the left , bead @xmath6 ; the remainder , @xmath7 , by the neighbour to the right , bead @xmath8 . denoting the load on a bead @xmath9 and its weight @xmath10 we may write @xmath11   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + w_{n+1 } ( t-1 ) f_{n+1 } ( t-1 ) + i_n ( t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the content of eq ( 1 ) is that the load on a bead is the sum of the loads transmitted to it by its neighbours in the layer above plus its own weight . the last term in eq ( 1 )",
    "is called the injection term .",
    "once the fractions are specified , a given load on the top layer can be propagated downward by use of eq ( 1 ) .    in the @xmath0-model",
    "it is assumed that the fractions are independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "the distribution is assumed to be symmetric about @xmath12 to avoid introducing a horizontal drift to the flow of stress ; in other words it is assumed @xmath13 .",
    "there is no other restriction .",
    "thus the @xmath0-models really constitute an enormous family of models corresponding to different symmetric distributions @xmath14 . to fully specify a particular model it is necessary to choose the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "one obvious possibility is to take @xmath14 to be uniformly distributed over the unit interval ; another is to assume that the fractions must be 0 or 1 with equal probability .",
    "the latter is called the singular distribution .",
    "mathematically , the @xmath0-model is a problem of random walkers that coalesce upon contact and fission spontaneously .",
    "the singular distribution corresponds to the case that the walkers coalesce but do not fission .",
    "coppersmith _ et al .",
    "_ argued that , neglecting injection , at sufficient depth the distribution of load would attain a steady state @xcite .",
    "they studied @xmath15 , the probability distribution of load on beads in a sufficiently deep layer . for almost all distributions @xmath14 , except the singular distribution , they concluded that @xmath16 decays exponentially for large @xmath9 .",
    "this agrees with experiment and constitutes an important success of the @xmath0-model .",
    "for the singular distribution , coppersmith _",
    "_ argued that @xmath17 follows a power law .",
    "hence they conjectured that the singular distribution constitutes a critical point in the family of @xmath0-models .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to make this analogy to thermodynamic critical phenomena precise by detailed analysis of the critical point .    in spite of the success mentioned above the @xmath0-model",
    "can not be considered a complete theory of stress propagation in granular matter .",
    "this is clear both empirically and on grounds of internal consistency . since the publication of the @xmath0-model , interesting new ideas on the subject of stress flow have appeared @xcite , but in this paper we restrict attention to the @xmath0-model",
    "this seems justified because the @xmath0-model does capture some elements of the physics correctly and because it exhibits non - trivial critical behaviour that is interesting in its own right .",
    "further motivation to study the @xmath0-model and particularly its critical point comes from hydrology . to make contact with that subject consider a singular @xmath0-model with zero injection and imagine that only a few beads in the top layer are loaded .",
    "the load then zig - zags downwards , perhaps along the lines shown in fig 2 .",
    "if we interpret these lines as tributaries merging to form a river we arrive at scheidegger s model @xcite which appeared in the hydrology literature more than thirty years ago .",
    "networks of tributaries in river basins are known empirically to be scale invariant structures that obey a variety of power laws .",
    "scheidegger networks too obey these laws and are in this statistical sense extremely realistic representations of river basins .",
    "an excellent discussion of river basin power laws is given in refs @xcite .",
    "ref @xcite presents some discussion of data ; ref @xcite provides a detailed comparison between real and scheidegger networks .",
    "here we wish to point out that non - singular @xmath0-models too can be interpreted as models of river networks . for example , consider a model in which the fractions can take only the values 0 , 1/2 and 1 with probability @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "this model reduces to scheidegger s as @xmath20 .",
    "it produces networks similar to scheidegger s except that occasionally streams split to form distributaries .",
    "thus this network is topologically distinct from scheidegger networks .",
    "more significantly , as we show below , a network with non - zero @xmath19 is not scale - invariant .",
    "this is reminiscent of a river network model studied by narayan and fisher @xcite . in their `` rocky - river '' model",
    "too the network is not scale invariant except if a model parameter is tuned to a special ( critical ) value .",
    "effectively this tuning parameter also controls river splitting .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that river splitting is a relevant perturbation that spoils the scale invariant structure of networks . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on showing that @xmath0-model networks with river splitting are not scale invariant .",
    "we do not explore whether such non - scale invariant networks are realised in nature ( for further discussion and speculation in this regard , however , see section vii ) .",
    "a quantum hall multilayer consists of layers of two - dimensional electron gases stacked vertically .",
    "multilayers can be realised by fabricating an appropriate gaas heterostructure @xcite .",
    "they are also realised naturally in some organic salts . in a quantum hall multilayer",
    "a sufficiently large magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the layers so that the lowest landau level in each layer is fully occupied . under this circumstance",
    "the only important electronic states in each layer are the chiral edge states that propagate in one direction only as shown in fig 3(a ) .",
    "these edge states are coupled by tunneling between layers .",
    "thus the surface of a multilayer is covered by a chiral sheath of coupled edge states .",
    "these surface states control the electrical transport properties of the multilayer .",
    "a central question from a quantum transport point of view is whether these surface states are localized or extended in the direction of the field @xcite .",
    "fig 3(b ) shows a network model of the multilayer surface introduced by saul , kardar and read @xcite and studied by many authors subsequently . in this model",
    "it is assumed that tunneling between edges takes place only at discrete nodes ( dashed vertical lines in fig 3b ) that appear at regular intervals along an edge .",
    "the edges are separated by nodes into horizontal segments called links .",
    "the wavefunction has a definite value on each link .",
    "each node is visited by two incoming links and by two outgoing links .",
    "each node is characterised by a @xmath21 s - matrix that relates the wavefunction on the outgoing links to the incoming amplitudes .",
    "once the s - matrices are specified , given the wavefunction through a vertical slice , we can propagate it to the right .",
    "the s - matrices are chosen at random from some ensemble to incorporate the effect of disorder . to fully specify the model it is necessary to choose a distribution for the s - matrices .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal direction @xcite .",
    "the directed network model above is quantum mechanical but in the limit of infinite circumference and for a special choice of disorder , saul , kardar and read have shown that it reduces to a _ classical _ model , the @xmath0-model with uniform distribution of fractions and zero injection @xcite . in section vi we discuss some respects in which more generic models of the multilayer surface , that do not reduce to classical models , still do show behaviour similar to the @xmath0-model @xcite . at the same time",
    "we show that in case of finite circumference quantum interference effects become important and there is little to be learnt from the study of the classical @xmath0-model . instead",
    "a mapping to a ferromagnetic supersymmetric spin - chain has proved fruitful in this case @xcite . in section",
    "vi we discuss aspects of this mapping .",
    "a detailed summary of our results is given in section vii .",
    "the reader interested in first obtaining an overview of the paper or interested only in the results should proceed directly to section vii .",
    "coppersmith _ et al . _ analysed the distribution of load @xmath22 at very large depth where presumably a steady state is achieved @xcite . here",
    "we study how the distribution evolves as a function of depth to this asymptotic steady state .",
    "we assume that a uniform load is applied to the top layer , @xmath23 in this section we neglect the weight of each bead ( the injection term ) . in partial support of this neglect",
    "we note that in the experiment of ref @xcite typically a total load of 7600 n was applied to the bead pack . in comparison",
    "we estimate that the weight of a single bead was less than a mn ; of the entire pack , less than 100 n. however , right at the critical point injection is a relevant perturbation , and at sufficiently large depth must be taken into account even if the weight of a single bead is small .",
    "we return to the effects of injection in section iv .    to make the problem tractable we study not the entire distribution @xmath24 but only its lowest non - trivial moment . with the neglect of injection it follows that the total load on every layer is the same ; the @xmath0-model dynamics ( eq 1 ) just shuffles this load .",
    "hence the average load in layer @xmath2 @xmath25 the lowest non - trivial moment is therefore the variance @xmath26 since a uniform load is applied to the top layer the variance in that layer vanishes .",
    "as the load propagates downward , the fluctuations must grow and saturate .",
    "our purpose is to analyse this evolution for different distributions @xmath14 , particularly those that are close to the singular distribution .",
    "right at the critical point the asymptotic distribution @xmath17 is believed to be a power law .",
    "if we assume that it does not have a well defined variance , then by analogy to critical phenomena we surmise that close to the critical point the variance must diverge as @xmath27 here @xmath19 measures the distance of a distribution @xmath14 from the singular distribution ; @xmath19 will be defined precisely below .",
    "we also expect that the depth - scale @xmath28 at which the steady state is attained will diverge as the critical point is approached .",
    "thus @xmath29 @xmath28 is a vertical correlation length that diverges as the critical point is approached . combining eqs ( 5 ) and ( 6 )",
    "we expect that close to the critical point the fluctuations must have a scaling form @xmath30 to be consistent with eq ( 5 ) we expect that the scaling function @xmath31 const as @xmath32 . for short times",
    "we expect that the system should behave as it would at the critical point .",
    "the @xmath19 dependence should cancel and so we expect @xmath33 for @xmath34 so that @xmath35 at the critical point .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will confirm that eq ( 7 ) and these inferences are valid .",
    "we will determine the exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the scaling function @xmath38 .",
    "as an aside to experts we note that it may have been more natural to name the exponents @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these names follow from a more general scaling hypothesis for the entire distribution ( eq 174 ) .",
    "however in this section we have elected to make the more restricted hypothesis eq ( 7 ) and to give the exponents single letter names taking care to avoid common exponent names such as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "consider the correlation function @xmath43 we assume there are @xmath44 beads in each layer and we impose periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "ultimately we are interested in taking @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath46 is even for both @xmath47 even and @xmath47 odd .",
    "in terms of the correlation function the variance is given by @xmath48 the correlation function obeys a remarkably simple evolution equation .",
    "this equation can be solved by straightforward classical analysis to yield the evolution of the variance .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain the entire correlation function by this method , and thereby obtain information on the horizontal correlation length , but we do not attempt this here .    to analyse the evolution of the correlation function we write @xmath49 to obtain the second line of eq ( 10 ) we have used eq ( 1 ) .",
    "four terms result ; we have written only one for illustration . to obtain the third line it is crucial to observe that @xmath50 depends only on fractions in the layers above .",
    "it is not correlated with the fractions in layer @xmath2 , allowing us to factorise the average as shown .    to perform the average",
    "we need information about the distribution @xmath14 . by symmetry for any choice of distribution @xmath51 for the variance",
    "we write @xmath52 @xmath53 is a parameter that characterises the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "for example , @xmath54 for the uniform distribution .",
    "for the singular distribution the parameter takes its maximum possible value @xmath55 . since the fractions for different beads",
    "are assumed to be independently distributed we conclude @xmath56    substituting eq ( 13 ) in eq ( 10 ) we obtain @xmath57 in the second line of eq ( 14 ) the other terms have been unveiled .",
    "recall that @xmath46 takes even integer values .",
    "it is convenient to replace @xmath58 to obtain @xmath59    eq ( 15 ) is the main result of this subsection .",
    "it governs the evolution of the correlation function .",
    "we wish to solve it subject to the initial condition @xmath60 the initial condition follows from the definition of @xmath61 ( eq 8) and the assumed uniform load on the top layer .",
    "note that the distribution @xmath14 enters the evolution equation only through the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "since the parameter takes its maximum value @xmath55 for the singular distribution we may define @xmath62 as the distance of a distribution @xmath14 from the critical point .",
    "it is easy to verify that a steady state solution to eq ( 15 ) is @xmath63 assuming this is the unique steady state towards which our initial condition evolves , eq ( 18 ) reveals that the variance does diverge as the singular distribution is approached . using eq ( 9 ) @xmath64 comparing eq ( 5 )",
    "we see that the exponent @xmath65 .",
    "eq ( 18 ) also reveals that in steady state the fluctuations in load are uncorrelated for all pairs of beads including neighbours .",
    "this is in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "a full solution of evolution dynamics needs more work .",
    "schematically eq ( 15 ) states @xmath66 the strategy we adopt here is to seek the eigenvectors of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and to expand the initial correlation vector @xmath69 in terms of the eigenvectors , @xmath70 the correlation vector at depth @xmath2 is then @xmath71    a complication we must negotiate is that @xmath67 is non - hermitian . according to the standard theory of biorthogonal expansion ( briefly recounted in appendix a ) to execute the plan above we must _ prove _ that the eigenvectors of @xmath67 span the vector space .",
    "then we must find the eigenvectors of @xmath72 , called the left eigenvectors of @xmath67 in this context .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath72 are the complex conjugate of the eigenvalues of @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath73 @xmath74 denotes the left eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath75 .",
    "having completed these tasks we may write the completeness relation @xmath76 using eq ( 25 ) we conclude that the expansion coefficients in eq ( 22 ) are determined by the left eigenvectors : @xmath77    implementing the plan we first write the eigenvalue equation for @xmath67 @xmath78 note that for @xmath79 eq ( 27 ) may be interpreted as the schrdinger equation for a free particle on a tightbinding lattice , familiar from elementary solid state physics . for non - zero @xmath53",
    "the particle may be viewed as scattering off a ( non - hermitian ) barrier at the origin .",
    "thus we seek a solution of the scattering form @xmath80 here @xmath81 .",
    "the first line of eq ( 27 ) then yields the eigenvalue @xmath82 the next three lines yield the scattering coefficients @xmath83 there are also scattering solutions to eq ( 27 ) corresponding to the fictitious particle coming in from the right @xmath84 by symmetry the scattering coefficients for this state are also given by eq ( 30 ) .",
    "there are no bound state solutions to eq ( 27 ) .",
    "the scattering solutions we have found all have real eigenvalues . in principle , since @xmath67 is non - hermitian , complex eigenvalues are also possible .",
    "however it turns out there are no solutions with complex eigenvalue that are biorthonormalisable .",
    "it will be seen that the scattering solutions we have found constitute a complete set .",

    "finally we would like to re - express eq ( 41 ) in terms of standard special functions .",
    "some of the manipulations will prove useful later in the analysis of injection .",

    "@xmath318 is the dispersion relation , the eigenvalue at wave vector @xmath328 . from eq ( 121 )",
    "we see that the energy level spectrum is a continuous band between zero and one .",
    "the momentum space green s function for this tight - binding lattice would normally be written @xmath330 comparing eq ( 127 ) to eq ( 122 ) we see that @xmath319 is essentially the green s function with @xmath331 .",
    "it is familiar from quantum mechanics that the real space green s function at the origin , @xmath332 regarded as a function of ( complex ) @xmath333 , has a branch cut running from @xmath334 to @xmath335 , the interval that supports the eigenvalue band .",
    "it is not difficult to use the familiar arguments to conclude that , regarded as a function of complex @xmath100 , @xmath336 has a branch cut along the line @xmath337 to @xmath338 ( onto which the segment [ 0,1 ] maps under the transformation @xmath331 ) .",
    "the analytic properties of @xmath339 will prove useful in the next sub - section .",
    "in this subsection we study the evolution of the variance in the large depth scaling limit . thus @xmath113 and @xmath19 is zero or very close to it throughout .",
    "an advantage of studying the large depth limit is that we do not have to calculate @xmath323 exactly ; it is only necessary to calculate the leading behaviour as @xmath340 .",
    "one way to understand this is to consider the critical case @xmath137 . in this case",
    "we expect that at great depth @xmath341 it is easy to show that for @xmath342 , the @xmath100-transform is @xmath343 plus less singular terms .",
    "thus for a function that behaves as @xmath344 for large @xmath2 also the @xmath100-transform is @xmath345 if we know the leading singularity of @xmath323 as @xmath340 we can use eq ( 130 ) to read off the large depth behaviour .",
    "another way to see that we only need the behaviour of @xmath346 as @xmath340 is to consider inverting the @xmath100-transform by the contour integral method of appendix b. this is accomplished by folding the contour over the branch point of @xmath323 at @xmath337 and integrating along the cut . in that",
    "integral @xmath347 is weighted by a factor that decays extremely rapidly away from @xmath337 at large depths .",
    "our goal therefore is to analyse the @xmath340 behaviour of @xmath348 since by a straightforward re - arrangement the integral in eq ( 126 ) simplifies to @xmath349 g(\\vec{p},z ) = \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{z }",
    "\\right ) g(z ) + \\frac{1}{z}.\\ ] ] insight into the behaviour of @xmath350 can be gained by expanding @xmath318 around @xmath351 to obtain @xmath352 if we set @xmath337 in eq ( 133 ) the integrand diverges as @xmath353 for @xmath354 ; it is regular in more than two dimensions .",
    "thus in more than two dimensions @xmath350 has a branch point at @xmath337 but there is no actual divergence . in two dimensions or less",
    "there is an actual divergence .",
    "the leading behaviour of @xmath350 above two dimensions is thus simply obtained by setting @xmath337 in eq ( 131 ) : @xmath355 in two dimensions we can obtain the singularity by recognising @xmath350 to be a jacobi elliptic integral .",
    "square lattice green s functions are known to be related to jacobi s elliptic functions ; but since our lattice features next - nearest neighbour hopping , in addition to the customary nearest neighbour hopping , we outline the analysis in appendix d. the result is that for @xmath340 @xmath356 for @xmath357 we obtain the singular behaviour of @xmath350 in appendix d. the result is @xmath358 an important feature revealed by this calculation is that the singular behaviour of @xmath350 is controlled by the long wavelength behaviour of @xmath359 for all @xmath357 ; it breaks down as @xmath360 .",
    "although it is instructive to do the calculation for continuous @xmath276 to examine the @xmath360 limit , the only case that is physically relevant is of course the integer dimension @xmath361 .",

    "we set @xmath137 and substitute eqs ( 132 ) , ( 134 ) , ( 135 ) and ( 136 ) in eq ( 126 ) . except in two dimensions the @xmath100-transforms",
    "may be inverted by inspection of eq ( 130 ) . for",
    "two dimensions we must resort to the method of appendix b and finally obtain @xmath363 as indicated by the simple steady state solution , at the critical point the fluctuations grow without bound as a power of @xmath2 for all dimensions .",
    "the exponent becomes independent of @xmath276 for @xmath364 revealing @xmath278 as the upper critical dimension .    by substituting eq ( 132 ) and ( 136 ) in eq ( 126 )",
    "we can also obtain the behaviour of @xmath327 away from the critical point for less than two dimensions . inverting the @xmath100-transform by the method of appendix",
    "b we find @xmath365 here the exponents @xmath366 and the scaling function @xmath367 with @xmath368 a dimension dependent constant .",
    "again , only the result for @xmath361 is physically meaningful ; in this case eq ( 140 ) coincides with the result of section ii .",
    "in summary the main results of this section are that for all distributions , except the singular , at sufficient depth the load fluctuations saturate and ( in agreement with experiment ) there are no horizontal correlations in load ( eq 117 ) .",
    "the saturation value of the load variance diverges as the critical point is approached . at the critical point",
    "the load fluctuations grow without bound as a power of depth ( eq 137 ) . below two dimensions this exponent depends on dimensionality ; above two dimensions it is constant , revealing @xmath278 as the critical dimension . at the critical dimension",
    "the growth of fluctuations is tempered by a logarithmic factor as might be expected at a critical dimension .",
    "we have also evaluated the scaling function that describes the growth and saturation of load fluctuations near the critical point for @xmath357 .",
    "in this section we turn to the chiral wave models that are believed to adequately describe the surface electronic states of a quantum hall multilayer .",
    "we begin by examining the circumstances under which the quantum network model of saul , kardar and read @xcite discussed in section i is equivalent to a @xmath0-model .    following saul , kardar and read ,",
    "the first step is to identify pairs of links ( joined by vertical grey bars in fig 9 ) as `` beads '' .",
    "the `` load '' on a bead is the total probability that the electron is on either of its two constituent links .",
    "load propagates from left to right now rather than top to bottom as it did in our earlier depictions of the @xmath0-model . for this reason we will label the vertical co - ordinate @xmath3 and the horizontal co - ordinate @xmath2 here ( see fig 3 ) .    to analyse how load propagates consider an elementary vertex of the saul , kardar and read model shown in fig 9 .",
    "the wave function amplitudes are related via @xmath369 here @xmath370 is a random @xmath21 su(2 ) rotation matrix .",
    "saul , kardar and read assumed the @xmath370-matrices were drawn from the invariant distribution for the su(2 ) group @xcite .",
    "the loads on beads a , b and c are respectively @xmath371 , @xmath372 and @xmath373 . by unitarity @xmath374 .",
    "thus bead a sends a fraction @xmath375 of its load to neighbour b and the remainder @xmath376 to neighbour c.    a key feature of the saul , kardar and read model is that the distribution of the fractions , @xmath14 is independent of the input amplitudes @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "this follows from the assumed group invariant distribution for the @xmath370-matrices .",
    "it is this feature that allows the saul , kardar and read model to be mapped onto a @xmath0-model .    to derive the distribution of the fractions recall that an su(2 ) matrix may be parametrized @xmath379 with @xmath380 real and subject to @xmath381 . if we take @xmath382 then @xmath383 . from the invariant distribution for su(2 ) matrices , @xmath384 it is not difficult to show that the fraction @xmath375 follows the uniform distribution , @xmath385 for @xmath386 .",
    "now suppose the wave function is known through the vertical slice @xmath314 .",
    "we could propagate the wave function @xmath2 slices to the right using the quantum saul , kardar and read model .",
    "alternatively we could calculate the load in the initial layer and propagate it to the right using the @xmath0-model with uniform distribution . either way the load we obtain in layer",
    "@xmath2 would be the same statistically .",
    "this is the sense in which the saul , kardar and read model is equivalent to the @xmath0-model .",
    "note that the @xmath0-model does not keep track of phase information .",
    "the mapping is useful only under circumstances that the phase information is unimportant .",
    "below we will discuss some problems of wave packet dynamics for which the mapping is useful .",
    "the mapping can also be used to study vertical transport in the quantum hall multilayer in the limit of large circumference but we do not discuss that application here .",
    "an obvious circumstance when the phase information is important and the mapping can not be used is if periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal @xmath2-direction , as would be appropriate for a multilayer in the fully phase - coherent , mesoscopic regime .",
    "phase information is needed to match the wavefunction after it is propagated around the circumference .",
    "we will develop this point in a more technical way in subsection vi c.    another case in which a quantum network model will map onto a @xmath0-model is if the wavefunctions and @xmath370-matrices are chosen to be real and the @xmath370-matrices are further assumed to be distributed over the subgroup of rotations about the @xmath387-axis with appropriate invariant measure .",
    "the fraction distribution @xmath388 for the @xmath1model that results . for most distributions of the @xmath370-matrix",
    "however it is not possible to obtain even the limited mapping between the quantum network model and the classical @xmath0-model obtainable in this and in the saul , kardar and read case .",
    "finally we present a convenient continuum model of the multilayer surface governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath389 since the equation is first order in @xmath2 , given the wavefunction at a fixed @xmath2 slice we can use it to propagate the wavefunction to the right , just as in the discrete network model . in the transverse direction the model is discrete and second -order .",
    "disorder is incorporated by taking the hopping elements @xmath390 to be random . for a discussion of the relationship between onsite and hopping disorder see ref @xcite .",
    "evidently this model can not be reduced to a classical @xmath0-model .      in this section",
    "we briefly discuss wave packet dynamics for the models of the previous section .",
    "mathematically this problem is identical to the motion of a wave - packet in a crystal with noise ( temporal randomness ) .",
    "it also bears formal resemblance to the directed polymer model , an important problem in statistical mechanics .",
    "hence it is a problem of general interest and has been studied since at least the 1970s from various points of view ( see ref @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "a considerable amount is now known .",
    "for the saul , kardar and read model wave - packet dynamics can be studied using the mapping to the @xmath0-model ; indeed the mapping was introduced for this purpose . in this section",
    "we will formulate the problem and summarize known results .",
    "these results reveal that the @xmath0-model and the continuum wave model introduced in the last section behave in qualitatively similar ways .",
    "consider an electron localized at @xmath391 at @xmath314 .",
    "this wavepacket can be propagated to the right using eq ( 143 ) .",
    "as it propagates it will broaden and its mean position will deflect . it is interesting to know how the breadth and deflection grow with displacement and to analyse the distribution of `` load '' at sufficiently great displacement that a steady state is reached .",
    "the root mean square width of the wave - packet grows as the square root of the displacement .",
    "this was derived for the continuum model in the 1970s @xcite and it is easy to show that the same form is obtained in the saul , kardar and read model .",
    "the root mean square deflection grows as the fourth root of the displacement .",
    "this result has been obtained numerically and analytically for both the saul , kardar and read @xcite and continuum models @xcite .    to compare the distribution of load , for the continuum model",
    "we define the load on an edge as @xmath392 . the asymptotic distribution of load , @xmath393 was obtained by coppersmith _ et al . _ for the @xmath0-model @xcite . for various distributions of the fractions ,",
    "@xmath14 , they found that @xmath393 decayed exponentially with @xmath9 with a power law prefactor that depended on the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "for the uniform distribution the prefactor was a constant .",
    "the corresponding result for the continuum wave model was obtained by ref @xcite by mapping the problem onto an su(1,1 ) quantum ferromagnet . here too the result for the load distribution is an exponential with a prefactor linear in @xmath9 .",
    "we have emphasized above that the equivalence between the saul , kardar and read model and the @xmath0-model is useful only when open boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal @xmath2-direction ; it breaks down for periodic boundary conditions needed to describe transport in phase - coherent multilayers .",
    "the importance of boundary conditions is also reflected in field theory formulations of these models . in ref @xcite the continuum model with open boundary conditions was mapped onto a heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "in contrast , with periodic boundary conditions a mapping to a supersymmetric analogue of the heisenberg ferromagnet was obtained in refs @xcite    in this section we derive the supersymmetric spin representation following the operator methods of ref @xcite .",
    "this derivation highlights the role of boundary conditions , the feature we wish to emphasize here .",
    "it only makes use of operator methods and is in this sense more elementary than the functional methods of ref @xcite .",
    "moreover mappings to supersymmetric spin models have recently been used fruitfully not only to study the multilayer but also to provide non - perturbative insights into various other problems of electron localization @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that the present derivation , with its emphasis on boundary conditions and its use of operator methods will prove of interest in this broader context also .",
    "we wish to evaluate @xmath394 , the green s function for the continuum model governed by the schrdinger equation , @xmath395 and subject to the periodic boundary condition @xmath396 here @xmath397 is the period in the @xmath2-direction . in ref @xcite , the green s function was calculated subject to the chiral boundary condition , @xmath398 for @xmath399 , leading to a simpler field theory formulation .",

    "the content of eq ( 167 ) is that to calculate the _ average _ diffuson we must create ( or for the other time order , annhilate ) a pair of r and a fermions and propagate the resulting state according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath449 .",

    "@xcite studied the entire distribution of load at very great depth where it was presumed that a steady state had been reached .",

    "our purpose is to study this evolution for all distributions of the fractions , @xmath14 , particularly those close to the singular distribution ( the critical point ) .    in section",
    "ii we consider the @xmath0-model in 1 + 1 dimensions without injection ( the weight of the beads is neglected ) . in this case",
    "the average load does not vary with depth since the total load is the same in every layer ; it is merely redistributed by the q - model dynamics . for the growth of the variance , by analogy to critical phenomena",
    ", we make the following hypotheses : for all distributions @xmath14 except the singular distribution we posit that the variance will saturate at sufficient depth . both the saturation depth and the saturated variance",
    "are expected to diverge as the distribution approaches the singular distribution .",
    "we introduce @xmath19 , a measure of the distance of a distribution @xmath14 from the singular distribution , and conjecture that the saturation depth @xmath28 will diverge as @xmath474 ; the saturated variance , as @xmath475 .",
    "more specifically , we expect that close to the critical point the variance will have a scaling form , eq ( 7 ) . for the singular distribution",
    "we expect that the variance will grow indefinitely as a power of the depth .",
    "close to the critical point and at depths shallow compared to the saturation depth the variance should grow as it would right at the critical point . from this and from eq ( 7 )",
    "we deduce a relationship between the critical exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the exponent that describes the growth of the variance right at the critical point ; namely we expect that at the critical point the variance will grow as @xmath136 . in sections",
    "iib and iic we derive an exact formula for the variance as a function of depth ( eq 46 ) and study its scaling limit ( @xmath113 , @xmath20 but with @xmath476 arbitrary ) .",
    "these calculations bear out all the expectations enumerated above , provide the precise form of the scaling function [ eq ( 50 ) and fig 4 ] and yield the exact exponents ( eq 49 ) .",
    "in section iii we characterise the critical point more fully by analysing the evolution with depth of the entire distribution of load right at the critical point in 1 + 1 dimensions . in the absence of injection",
    "the critical point is a simple model of random walkers that coalesce upon contact ; hence it is quite straightforward to derive these results .",
    "we present them because they illuminate the results of the previous section . at large depth",
    "it is found that the distribution of load consists of a large spike at zero load together with a smooth part [ eq ( 73 ) and ( 76 ) ] .",
    "it is overwhelmingly probable that the load on a bead is zero ; most of the weight of the distribution is in the spike .",
    "the smooth part follows the anticipated scaling form ( eq 53 ) .",
    "its width grows as the square root of the depth , consistent with the exponent found in section ii to describe the growth of the variance of load at the critical point .    in section iv the effect of injection",
    "is included .",
    "for simplicity we consider only 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we assume that the weights of the beads are independent and identically distributed random variables .",

    "close to the critical point we conjecture that the variance will have the form eq ( 78 ) .",
    "we are able to deduce all the exponents in eq ( 78 ) and to obtain some limiting behaviours of the scaling function through simple ( non - rigourous ) arguments .",
    "these conjectures are all verified by the exact calculation of sections iv a and iv b which provides the precise form of the scaling function [ eqs ( 99 ) , ( 102 ) and ( 103 ) ] and yields all the exponents [ eqs ( 80 ) , ( 81 ) and ( 84 ) ] .",
    "we find that beyond a crossover depth the variance ( normalized by the squared mean ) saturates .",
    "the saturation value and the crossover depth both diverge as the critical point is approached . at depths less than the crossover depth the variance grows as it would right at the critical point ( eq 106 ) .",
    "the behaviour at the critical point has many crossovers if the weight of the beads is small compared to the applied load . in this case",
    "at first the variance grows as the square root of the depth as it was found to do in section ii in the absence of injection . at greater depths",
    "there are crossovers to growth as @xmath2 and @xmath219 , as first the effects of large rare fluctuations in the weight of a bead and then mean injection assert themselves . ultimately at the critical point",
    "the variance grows with the 5/2 exponent but the depth at which this behaviour sets in can be very great if the mean injection is small .",
    "this depth diverges as @xmath477 .",
    "the crossover exponent 4/3 , deduced by simple arguments and then via exact calculation in section iv , agrees with the value previously obtained by a different method by majumdar and sire @xcite . in their work majumdar and sire only study the behaviour right at the critical point .",

    "the power is given by @xmath478 for @xmath357 .",
    "for all dimensions above two the growth is linear .",
    "this shows that @xmath278 is the upper critical dimension for this problem .",
    "for @xmath278 we find a linear growth of the variance tempered by a log factor as might be expected at the critical dimension .",
    "an intriguing feature of the critical behaviour we obtain is that it is exhibited at all .",
    "for ordinary continuous phase transitions the renormalization group provides a framework to understand the critical behaviour .",
    "we are not aware of any such framework for the @xmath0-model .",
    "random critical points are notoriously difficult to analyse in general .",
    "the feature that allows us to analyse the @xmath0-model is that the two point load correlation function [ defined by eqs ( 8) and ( 114 ) ] evolves with depth according to a simple linear equation . in section",
    "ii we analyse the evolution by expanding in the eigenvectors of an appropriate linear operator .",
    "there are some subtleties posed by the non - hermiticity of the linear operator , making it necessary to prove that its eigenvectors are complete ( further complicated by the infinite dimensionality of the vector space ) .",
    "nonetheless we like this approach because it parallels transfer matrix methods used for equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "we find that the large depth scaling behaviour is controlled by the low energy long wavelength eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian `` hamiltonian '' .",
    "another virtue of this approach is that with about the same effort it yields both the variance and the correlation functions .",
    "however we have left analysis of the correlation functions open for later work . here",
    "we focus entirely on the variance of the load . in section",
    "v we analyse the variance using another technique based on transform methods .",
    "our analysis , neglecting injection , confirms that the q - model has essentially no horizontal correlations in the steady state for any distribution except the singular .",
    "this agrees with experiments on bead packs .",
    "the bulk of our results however are concerned with the q - model close to the critical point .",
    "bead pack experiments such as those of ref @xcite appear to be far from the critical point .",
    "we estimate @xmath479 for this experiment .",
    "it is not obvious how to tune the parameter for bead packs to access the critical behaviour we analyse here .",
    "have also studied the horizontal steady state correlations of the @xmath0-model without injection away from the critical point @xcite .",
    "they employ a continuum limit and arrive at conclusions similar to eq ( 19 ) in section iib .",
    "the main focus of their work however is to explore a tensor model of stress propagation in granular matter , intended to supplant the @xmath0-model .",
    "interpreted in terms of river networks our results show that allowing a small amount of river splitting in a scheidegger network introduces a length scale in the vertical direction . on sufficiently long length scales",
    "such a network is not scale invariant .",
    "this resembles the finding of narayan and fisher @xcite . in their model",
    "too there was a parameter that controlled river splitting .",
    "their networks were not scale invariant unless river splitting was tuned to zero .",
    "however their model appears to be in a different universality class as its vertical correlation exponent is different from the value @xmath480 we obtain here in section ii .",
    "presumably the difference is because their rule for stream splitting was non - local and depended on the entire history of the network upstream from the split .    taken together with the model of narayan and fisher it appears that river splitting is a perturbation that spoils the scale invariance of river networks .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether such networks exist in nature .",
    "river deltas are one possibility .",
    "traced backwards they may constitute networks of merging streams that occasionally split . even for river basins it might be interesting to examine the extent to which streams split . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that some of the data against which river scaling laws are tested are based not on actual maps of the river network but on networks that are indirectly inferred according to certain rules from digital elevation data obtained from satellite images .",
    "the rules by which the network is inferred from the elevation maps exclude the possibility of splitting @xcite .    in summary",
    "the @xmath0-model is rich in applications and behaviour and yet analytically tractable by elementary means a combination of circumstances that invites further exploration . among the many problems that remain open we conclude by mentioning two : for the @xmath0-model beyond the saturation depth",
    "there is no correlation in the horizontal direction but in the vertical direction there are very strong and long ranged correlations @xcite .",
    "we have not obtained the precise form of these vertical correlations for the @xmath0-model either in steady state or at the critical point .",
    "it would be very interesting ( and straightforward ) to obtain these forms and the crossover between them .",
    "second it would be interesting to obtain the dynamics of the entire distribution of load near the critical point .",
    "we have not attempted to do this except right at the critical point .",
    "a natural scaling hypothesis is that the full distribution of load , neglecting injection , will be of the form @xmath481 the exponents in eq ( 174 ) are @xmath482 and @xmath483 .",
    "their values are fixed by our result for the variance away from the critical point derived in section ii and the result for the entire distribution at the critical point @xmath137 derived in section iii .",
    "we also know that for @xmath484 and @xmath485 , the presently unknown function @xmath486 has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath487 to be consistent with the critical point distribution ( eq 73 ) derived in section iii .    in the second part of this paper we turn to chiral wave models that are believed to describe the surface electronic states of a quantum hall multilayer .",
    "in section vi a we discuss circumstances under which the quantum network model of saul , kardar and read ( described in the introduction ) is equivalent to the @xmath0-model . in section vi b",
    "we compare known results about the behaviour of the @xmath0-model to a continuum chiral wave model that can not be mapped onto a @xmath0-model under any circumstance .",
    "the two are found to behave in qualitatively similar ways .",
    "a circumstance under which the mapping to the @xmath0-model is not useful is when periodic boundary conditions must be imposed in the chiral direction .",
    "physically this is because of the interference of electron paths that wind around the quantum hall multilayer .",
    "such long range interference can not be captured by the classical @xmath0-model . in this phase - coherent or mesoscopic regime , the chiral wave model has been studied via a mapping to a supersymmetric spin model @xcite . in section vi c",
    "we derive this mapping in a way that emphasizes boundary conditions .",
    "our derivation makes use of operator methods and is hence more elementary than the derivation of ref @xcite that makes use of mixed functional integrals over grassman and bosonic variables .",
    "we do not attempt further analysis of the superspin model here ; the interested reader should consult papers on multilayer transport , particularly refs @xcite and @xcite that provide a nice overview of the early work on this problem .",
    "mappings to superspin models have been useful not only in the study of the quantum hall multilayer but have also recently lead to new non - perturbative results and insights into other important problems of electron localization @xcite .",
    "hence it is hoped that our derivation , with its emphasis on boundary conditions and use of elementary operator methods , will be of interest in this general context .    _",
    "note added : _ while writing this paper we learnt of an",
    "_ e_-print by rajesh and majumdar on spatio - temporal correlations in the takayasu model and the @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "these authors derive many interesting results complementary to ours . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the behaviour close to the critical point . for the @xmath0-model rajesh and majumdar",
    "concentrate on length scales long compared to our vertical correlation length , @xmath28 ; the crossovers and scaling functions that we study are transients that are invisible in their asymptotic formulae .",
    "on the other hand they have derived both vertical and horizontal load correlation functions ; this paper is limited ( in practice but not in principle ) to the study of the variance of load . among their interesting findings",
    "are ( i ) they find power law correlations in the vertical direction both at the critical point and away from it addressing in part a question raised above .",
    "( ii ) they emphasize the interesting structure of the horizontal correlation function , including injection , at great depth .",
    "although the goals are a bit different , there are points of intersection between the two papers with regard to technique .",
    "rajesh and majumdar too exploit the linearity of the relation that describes the evolution of the correlations with depth and solve it using the method of section v. an overlapping result is a formula for the variance at the critical point in 1 + 1 dimensions including injection . at the large depths studied by rajesh and majumdar the last term in our eq ( 106 )",
    "should dominate .",
    "rajesh and majumdar obtain the same exponent 5/2 and the same numerical prefactor @xmath488 providing a nice check on both calculations .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge stimulating discussions with sue coppersmith and onuttom narayan .",
    "we thank onuttom narayan in particular for patient explanation of refs @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , for encouraging us to study the critical point and for explaining to us the significance of river splitting .",

    "first let us recall the principles of biorthogonal expansion ( see , for example , ref @xcite , p884 ) .",

    "consider its eigenvectors @xmath490 in context of biorthogonal expansion these eigenvectors are called the right eigenvectors .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the right eigenvalues are non - degenerate in this case .",
    "the bad news regarding the right eigenvectors is : ( i ) @xmath491 may be complex .",
    "( ii ) there is no guarantee that there are @xmath44 eigenvectors ( needed to span the vector space ) .",
    "( iii ) eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are not necessarily orthogonal .",
    "now consider the left eigenvectors , defined as the eigenvectors of @xmath72 .",
    "( i ) if @xmath491 is a right eigenvalue then @xmath75 is a left eigenvalue ( proof : the coefficients for the characteristic polynomials of @xmath67 and @xmath72 are complex conjugates of one another ) .",
    "( ii ) there are as many left eigenvectors as right .",
    "( iii ) left eigenvectors are orthogonal to right eigenvectors .    the last point merits elaboration .",
    "let @xmath492 denote the left eigenvector with left eigenvalue @xmath75 .",

    ". then we can prove the _ completeness _ relation @xmath498 the proof follows from the observation that if there are @xmath44 eigenvectors , any vector @xmath499 may be expanded as @xmath500 completeness then follows from biorthogonality , eq ( a3 ) .",
    "the problem in section iib presents some complications not present in the pedagogical discussion above . among them",
    "are degeneracy , an infinite dimensional vector space and a continuous spectrum .",
    "nonetheless the broad strategy is the same . in section iib",
    "we found left and right eigenvectors and we conjectured biorthogonality and completeness relations . to justify the analysis of section iib we must prove the completeness relation .",
    "that is the purpose of this appendix .",
    "note that we can not simply assume completeness is true  because the matrix @xmath67 is non - hermitian",
    "there are no theorems to guarantee it .",
    "nor can we prove completeness by counting eigenvectors as in the finite dimensional discussion above .",
    "the proof of completeness is remarkably simple and direct .",
    "we substitute the exact expressions for @xmath501 and @xmath502 that we have derived , eqs ( 28 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) , on the right hand side of eq ( 36 ) and verify the completeness relation by explicit evaluation of the integral .",
    "there are nine cases to consider corresponding to @xmath503 and @xmath504 .",
    "for illustration we analyse the case of @xmath505",

    "consider the series @xmath511 , @xmath512 its @xmath100-transform is defined as @xmath513 some @xmath100-transforms can be inverted by inspection . for example the inverse transform of @xmath514 is evidently @xmath515 in other cases the inverse transform can be found by performing the complex integral @xmath516 the contour @xmath517 must enclose the origin but no singularities of @xmath518 .    for illustration",
    "let us analyse @xmath519 needed to go from eq ( 43 ) to ( 44 ) in section iib . here",
    "@xmath518 has a pole at @xmath521 and a branch cut at @xmath337 ( see fig 10 ) .",
    "we deform the contour @xmath517 that encloses the origin to contours @xmath522 and @xmath523 that encircle the pole and pass above and below the branch cut .",
    "hence obtain @xmath524 the first term is the contribution of the pole ; the second , of the branch cut .",
    "the asymptotics of the functions @xmath525 defined by eq ( 103 ) are needed to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the scaling functions in sections iic and ivb .",
    "the large @xmath208 behaviour poses no difficulty .",
    "evidently @xmath526 for all @xmath3 .",
    "the small @xmath208 behaviour is a bit more subtle .",

    "the divergence signals that the asymptotic series is not a simple power series in @xmath208 .",

    "the integral over @xmath552 in eq ( d1 ) may be regarded as an integral around the contour sketched in fig 11 since the two vertical segments cancel by the periodicity of the integrand and the horizontal segment at infinity makes no contribution because the integrand vanishes along it .",
