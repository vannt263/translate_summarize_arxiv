    "however , extending such strategy to the whole qd array would imply different values of the excitonic transition in each qd , i.e. , @xmath350 .",
    "this , besides obvious technological difficulties , would constitute a conceptual limitation of scalability towards massive quantum computations .",
    "the problem can be avoided following a completely different strategy originally proposed by lloyd@xcite and recently improved in ref .",
