    "massive stars explode at the end of their lives as core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , which we observe and classify spectroscopically on the basis of their optical spectra near maximum light ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) .",
    "these phenomenological spectroscopic classes are related to the state of the progenitor star at the time of explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "supernovae coming from stars that retain most of their massive hydrogen envelopes until the time of explosion are classified as type ii , while those lacking hydrogen due to either stellar winds or interaction with a companion star are classified as types ib and ic .",
    "progenitors with only small amounts of hydrogen remaining in their outer envelopes explode as sne iib , a classification named because their spectra transition from type ii at early times to type ib at late times .",
    "sne  iib are up to @xmath311% of the core - collapse sn population in a distance - limited sample @xcite .",
    "classical sne  ib are a further 7% of the core - collapse supernova sample , although some of those objects ( such as sn 1999dn ; branch et al .",
    "2002 ) likely had weak h@xmath0  absorption in their early - time spectra from a small residual hydrogen envelope .",
    "we will use the catch - all term `` stripped - envelope supernovae '' @xcite to refer to sne from massive stars lacking the thick hydrogen envelopes of typical sne ii .",
    "the prototypical sn  iib , sn 1993j , occurred in m81 and was one of the brightest sne of the 20th century .",
    "its proximity and late - time brightness at all wavelengths due to strong interaction with circumstellar material ( csm ) enabled numerous detailed studies that make it the second - best studied core - collapse sn after sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one of the youngest and best - studied supernova remnants in the galaxy , cassiopeia a ( cas a ) , was recently revealed to have been a sn iib on the basis of spectroscopy of scattered - light echoes from the supernova @xcite .",
    "we gained the opportunity to study another nearby stripped - envelope sn in great detail when @xcite announced the discovery of a possible supernova at unfiltered magnitude 16.1 in the nearby ( @xmath4  mpc ; pastorello et al .",
    "2008 [ p08 hereafter ] ) galaxy ngc 4490 on 2008 march 3.45 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "the following night , the new object was spectroscopically confirmed as a peculiar sn ii @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic classification continued to evolve as the supernova aged , with @xcite identifying the incipient lines diagnostic of sne iib by march 9.6 and @xcite using near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of sn  2008ax  on march 14.5 to classify it as typical of sne ib .",
    "fortuitously , @xcite had imaged ngc 4490 on march 3.19 and did not detect sn  2008ax  to a limiting unfiltered magnitude of 19.5 ( p08 ) .",
    "the supernova must have risen by at least 3.4 mag in the six hours before the first detection by @xcite , setting a strict limit on the time of shock breakout . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume a time for shock breakout of sn  2008ax  of 2008 march 3.32 , halfway between the non - detection by @xcite and the discovery by @xcite .",
    "this unusually early discovery enabled rapid follow - up observations at all wavelengths .",
    "observations of sne at very early times are obtained only rarely , but they are important because they reflect the state of the outermost layers of the progenitor star , which are otherwise difficult to study , and provide a crucial link between studies of core - collapse sne and their progenitors .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical light curves presented by @xcite show the initial phase of rapid cooling of the stellar envelope after shock breakout , a short - lived phenomenon occurring immediately after explosion that has only been observed in a handful of core - collapse sne .",
    "the proximity of the host galaxy enabled @xcite and @xcite to identify a source at the position of sn  2008ax  in pre - explosion _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "unfortunately , the apparent progenitor appears to be blended with other nearby sources , making the interpretation ambiguous .",
    "@xcite found that the progenitor could be modeled as either a massive star that had lost most of its hydrogen envelope in a wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase or as an interacting binary star .",
    "we conducted an extensive spectroscopic campaign to observe sn  2008ax , starting two days after shock breakout and extending into the nebular phase .",
    "our earliest spectra are sensitive to the composition of the outermost layers of the progenitor , while the latest ones probe the inner core .",
    "in addition , five epochs of nir spectra were taken over the first two months after explosion , starting 10 days after shock breakout .",
    "the nir spectra of stripped - envelope sne are less well - studied than those at optical wavelengths , but they provide a different window into the explosion with strong lines from light and intermediate - mass elements that are blended or obscured at optical wavelengths . the importance of sn  2008ax  also led us to obtain three epochs of optical spectropolarimetry .",
    "our first two observations were obtained within 9 days of shock breakout and allow us to study the geometry of the outer ejecta , while our final epoch extends our study of the geometry to the early nebular phase .",
    "optical photometry of sn  2008ax  has been presented by p08 , as well as a series of seven optical spectra starting 10 days after shock breakout and a single nir spectrum obtained after maximum light .",
    "additional photometry and preliminary modeling of the light curve were presented by @xcite .",
    "late - time optical spectra of sn  2008ax  were studied in detail by @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also presented a large optical and nir dataset .",
    "@xcite presented uv and optical light curves , as well as x - ray and radio detections , enabling study of pre - sn mass loss of the progenitor .",
    "@xcite also showed two optical spectra taken near maximum light .    in this paper , we add to the previous studies of sn  2008ax  by presenting our large and well - sampled spectroscopic dataset .",
    "the observations are described in  2 and the detailed optical through nir spectral evolution is discussed in  3 .",
    "a highlight of our study are the three epochs of optical spectropolarimetry showing large line polarizations beginning shortly after explosion , which are analyzed in  4 . implications of these observations are discussed in  5 .",
    "we obtained a well - sampled sequence of low - resolution optical spectra of sn 2008ax starting two days after discovery and extending into the early nebular phase .",
    "spectra were obtained using the kast spectrograph on the lick 3-m telescope @xcite , the low resolution imaging spectrometer @xcite on the keck i 10-m telescope , and the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) on the keck ii 10-m telescope . two - dimensional image reduction and spectral extraction were performed using standard tasks in iraf .",

    "we used the noise level in the spectrum to set 3@xmath34 limits on the ews of any unresolved narrow emission lines of 0.050.15   , dependent on wavelength .",

    "the appearance of @xmath86678 and @xmath87065 in the first week after explosion and their increasing strength thereafter was a sign that the progenitor of sn  2008ax  did not have the thick hydrogen envelope of typical sne  ii and instead was partially stripped .",

    "the lack of strong p@xmath45 in our sn  2008ax  spectra taken as soon as 10 days after shock breakout , and the relative prominence of the helium lines being quite different from sn  1993j at similar epochs , led @xcite to classify sn  2008ax  as a sn  ib .",

    "this suggests that a substantial fraction of objects classified as sne ib might have similar amounts of hydrogen in their outer ejecta as sn  2008ax .",
    "another example is the sn  ib 2007y @xcite , whose earliest spectra show strong high - velocity h@xmath0  absorption , but by maximum light also closely resembled sn  2005bf .",

    "as discussed by @xcite , this has important implications for the nature of their progenitors .",
    "additionally , the division between spectroscopic classifications of objects as sne ib vs. iib may in some cases depend on the timing of the initial spectroscopy , although not for those sne whose progenitors retain as much hydrogen as sn 1993j .    while there is a small possibility that some other line is blended with h@xmath0  and comes to dominate the absorption feature at late times",
    ", we believe the simplest explanation is that it is due to h@xmath0  at all times . as an example",
    ", @xcite claimed that the increasing prominence of @xmath86580 relative to h@xmath0  explained the time evolution of the 6300    feature in the sn ib 1999dn , but @xcite presented arguments against the presence of strong in that particular object , including the weakness of any @xmath84745 absorption .",
    "in addition , the lack of lines in the nir spectra of sn  2008ax  ( see below ) suggests that carbon likely does not make a strong contribution to the optical spectrum as well .",
    "further evidence to support the h@xmath0  identification for the 6270    feature in sn  2008ax  can be seen from its velocity evolution , which we have listed in table  [ ax_veltab ] and plotted in figure  [ ax_velplot ] .",
    "our velocity measurements for the absorption minima are derived by taking the wavelength of the minimum flux of a spline fit to the absorption profile and applying the relativistic doppler formula for the velocity .",

    "the very high early - time velocity of the h@xmath0  absorption minimum in sn  2008ax  rapidly declined until day 14 , when it started to asymptotically approach a value of @xmath713,500 km  s@xmath9 , which is well above the photospheric and helium velocities , but within the range of variation shown by the other objects .",

    "even if h@xmath0  were blended with absorptions from those ions , the late - time velocities are a strong argument that h@xmath0  must be dominant .",
    "we have not plotted the h@xmath45  velocities in figure  [ ax_velplot ] because h@xmath45  was completely dominated by lines after about day 9 , but our last solid detection on day 9 also had an absorption minimum at about @xmath51 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the most natural explanation is that the 6270    feature is indeed due to h@xmath0  and that it formed in a low - mass hydrogen - rich layer in the outer ejecta .",
    "the hydrogen velocities never dropped below @xmath713,000 km  s@xmath9  because there was no hydrogen interior to that in the ejecta .",
    "@xcite also point out that lines forming at significantly greater velocities than the continuum photosphere ( a geometry they term `` detached '' line formation ) will have a characteristic profile with deep p - cygni absorption and a weak emission component .",
    "this seems consistent with the unusually deep absorption components of the balmer lines in sn  2008ax  at early times ( fig .",

    "typical values for the polarization efficiency of galactic dust @xcite imply a potential host isp of 1.5% for our adopted reddening .",
    "the galactic component of the reddening should contribute negligibly to the isp . in order to separate intrinsic sn polarization from isp",
    ", we must make some assumptions .",
    "early work on the sn iib 1993j assumed that the intrinsic polarization in the emission component of h@xmath0  should be zero @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this assumption was false , at least in the case of the peculiar sn iib 2001ig , in part due to blending of @xmath86678 with the peak of h@xmath0 .",
    "our spectra of sn  2008ax  at these early times ( gray lines in fig .",
    "[ ax_rawpolplot ] , blue in the online version ) do show developing lines , so we will heed the cautionary example of sn 2001ig and use another method to estimate the isp .",
    "@xcite were able to robustly measure the isp to sn 2001ig from spectropolarimetry obtained on day 256 . at that late epoch ,",
    "the optical depth to electron scattering in the sn ejecta should be small as the expansion of the sn and consequent decrease in electron density results in geometric dilution of the scattering probability . as a consistency check",
    ", no polarization modulations were seen across sn spectral features , indicating that the measured polarization was entirely due to isp .",
    "a similar method was successfully used by @xcite to correct the collected sn 1987a polarization dataset for isp .",
    "our final epoch of spectropolarimetry of sn  2008ax  was taken on day 99 and is plotted in figure  [ ax_latepolplot ] .",
    "strong polarization modulations are still seen at this late time , particularly across the nir triplet emission feature near 8600   , indicating that there are still both substantial asphericities present in the ejecta and a sufficient optical depth to electron scattering to add a component of intrinsic sn polarization to the isp to form the polarization signal we measure .",
    "the pattern of the polarization modulations , with decreases in polarization present at the strong emission lines ( particularly in @xmath53 ) , suggests a method to decompose the polarization .",
    "we expect that the continuum polarization we see at this late time is due to photospheric continuum light scattering off electrons relatively deep in the ejecta .",
    "the strong emission lines which become more prominent as the supernova transitions to the nebular phase are mostly due to material located exterior to the region of highest optical depth to electron scattering .",
    "the intrinsically unpolarized photons in the lines will travel unimpeded to the outside observer , acquiring a polarization only from the isp along the line of sight .",
    "a similar dilution effect was seen by @xcite in the emission components of nebular lines such as [ ] in sne  iip at late times .    with that in mind ,",
    "we selected three wavelength regions of 6230@xmath76350 , 7250@xmath77370 , and 8470@xmath78730    to represent the peaks of strong emission features from ( respectively ) [ ] @xmath86300 , [ ] @xmath87300 , and the nir triplet .",
    "integrating the observed polarization over those three windows gave consistent values for the stokes parameters , with a spread of @xmath30.1% in each , indicating that the peaks of the three lines do have similar polarizations of about 0.7% .",
    "we fit an isp curve to 20    bins of the stokes parameters from those three regions , following the functional form of @xcite with the modifications by @xcite .",
    "we fixed the peak wavelength of the isp curve to 5550    ( or , equivalently , we set @xmath58 ) because the limited number of data points being fit were all at longer wavelengths than the expected peak , so the peak wavelength was not well constrained .",
    "our measured values for ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) are ( 0.59% , @xmath70.52% ) , which we adopt whenever we correct our data for isp below , along with the functional form for isp of @xcite .",
    "this isp value has an uncertainty of 0.1% in each stokes parameter based on the spread in the polarizations at the three line peaks , which is probably more realistic than the small formal errors from the fit @xcite .",
    "figures  [ ax_n1lineplot ] and [ ax_n2lineplot ] show wavelength intervals around important lines in the isp - subtracted day 6 and 9 data in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "in addition to presenting the data in the @xmath61 plane , it is helpful to plot the isp - subtracted spectropolarimetry versus wavelength . to do that",
    ", we will first want to choose more optimal coordinates than stokes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are defined in reference to the position angle ( p.a . ) of north on the sky , which is unrelated to any property of the supernova .",
    "the strong line - polarization modulations seen in figure  [ ax_rawpolplot ] appear as strong , almost linear features in the @xmath61 plane in figures [ ax_n1lineplot ] and [ ax_n2lineplot ] . despite individually being almost linear in the @xmath61 plane ,",
    "the line polarization features collectively are not aligned and prefer different polarization angles .",

    "inspection of figure  [ ax_rawpolplot ] reveals that the wavelength interval of 7000@xmath77450    on day 9 is devoid of strong line features in either the flux spectrum or the polarization .",
    "this region falls between the p - cygni absorption troughs from @xmath87065 and @xmath87774 , and we regard it as representative of the line - free continuum .",

    "the isp - subtracted polarization in the peak of the polarization feature associated with the h@xmath0  absorption trough on day  9 ( 6190@xmath76230   ) is @xmath64% at an angle of @xmath65 , consistent with the polarization angle of our adopted continuum region .",

    "we will choose a new coordinate system of rotated stokes parameters ( rsp ; trammell et al .",
    "1993a ; tran 1995 ) which aligns @xmath69  with this p.a .",
    "if the ejecta were axisymmetric , @xmath69  would be a good estimator of the total polarization and @xmath70  would be near zero .",
    "deviations from zero in @xmath70  are a signature of deviations from axisymmetry .",
    "an additional motivation for choosing rsp is to avoid the statistical bias of the formal polarization ( @xmath71 ) to positive values .",
    "the rotated spectropolarimetry is plotted versus wavelength in figures  [ ax_day6rotplot ] and [ ax_day9rotplot ] .",
    "we will start our exploration of the line - polarization behavior of sn  2008ax  with h@xmath0  because it is the strongest line in the spectrum and can be used as a reference .",
    "in addition to the full spectropolarimetry in figures [ ax_day6rotplot ] and [ ax_day9rotplot ] , we have plotted @xmath69  and @xmath70  versus velocity for h@xmath0  and h@xmath45  in figures [ ax_day6velplot ] and [ ax_day9velplot ] .    ignoring for the moment the modulations in @xmath70 , the basic shapes of the h@xmath0  polarization features on days 6 and 9",
    "match the `` inverted '' p - cygni polarization features discussed above . to test the expectation of low polarization near the line peak at zero velocity ( or alternatively , our choice of isp ) , we integrated the polarization over 6600@xmath76700    to estimate the h@xmath0  peak polarization , while avoiding most of the effects of the @xmath86678 absorption @xcite .",
    "we obtain values for ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) of ( @xmath72% , @xmath73% ) and ( @xmath74% , @xmath75% ) on days 6 and 9 , respectively .",
    "these low values for the h@xmath0  peak polarization despite some contamination from @xmath86678 give us additional confidence that our derived isp is reasonable .",
    "similar peaks in polarization can be seen in @xmath69  associated with most of the p - cygni absorption features in figures [ ax_day6rotplot ] and [ ax_day9rotplot ] . in particular , there are clear features at h@xmath45 , the lines near 5000   , @xmath85876 , @xmath87774 , and the nir triplet , as well as weaker peaks due to @xmath86678 and @xmath87065 . in a purely axisymmetric system ,",
    "all of the line features would show the inverted p - cygni features in @xmath69  but no modulation in @xmath70 , which is in clear conflict with the strong features seen in @xmath70  for some lines in figures [ ax_day6rotplot ] and [ ax_day9rotplot ] .",
    "this is not an artifact of a poor isp correction or coordinate rotation .",
    "the @xmath61 line - polarization plots in figures  [ ax_n1lineplot ] and [ ax_n2lineplot ] show that different lines have quite different polarization behaviors which are not aligned and indicate that the geometry of the ejecta of sn  2008ax  was quite complex .",
    "in addition to the evidence for deviations from axisymmetry seen from the ensemble of line features , individual lines show that the spatial distribution or excitation of individual chemical elements is complex .",
    "for example , the h@xmath0  data points in the upper - left panel of figure  [ ax_n1lineplot ] are connected in order of wavelength by a line .",
    "if the h@xmath0  geometry were axisymmetric , the points would fall in a line .",
    "however , the modulation seen in @xmath70  manifests itself in this plot as a two - dimensional spread of the h@xmath0  points .",
    "this spread is not random , but shows a systematic trend with wavelength in a manner consistent with the @xmath61 `` loops '' first identified by @xcite in spectropolarimetry of sn  1987a .",
    "loops are not confined to h@xmath0 ; all the lines plotted in figures [ ax_n1lineplot ] and [ ax_n2lineplot ] show evidence for loop - like structure .",
    "@xcite proposed that individual clumps of @xmath44ni could result in h@xmath0  excitation asymmetries that produce wavelength - dependent polarization angle rotations across the line profile .",
    "while the loops in sn  1987a were seen in h@xmath0  and , subsequent work has found them to be ubiquitous in core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of loops and their implied velocity - dependent polarization angles has remained obscure .",
    "one possibility is that the clumpiness of the ejecta results in each isovelocity surface intersecting a somewhat different spatial distribution of each chemical element .",
    "however , if the clumps only existed on small scales , the polarization angles in different velocity bins would be essentially independent .",
    "the systematic rotation of the polarization angle with velocity implies that the relevant asphericities are coherent on larger scales .",
    "@xcite investigated the loop seen in the nir triplet of the sn ia 2001el and found that loops were generically produced by a line - scattering region with a misaligned axis of symmetry relative to the continuum and therefore that inversion of the observed stokes parameters for a single object was highly underconstrained . despite sn 2001el being a sn ia , the models of @xcite are surprisingly relevant to sn  2008ax , at least for h@xmath0 . in sn 2001el ,",
    "the geometry involved a high - velocity absorption from detached above the photosphere .",
    "as discussed above , the h@xmath0  line in sn  2008ax  is also detached from the photosphere in a high - velocity shell .",
    "the misaligned aspherical shell models of @xcite may therefore be quite relevant . with the long axis of the h@xmath0  loop being largely aligned with the continuum polarization",
    ", the h@xmath0  distribution likely has only a slight misalignment with the symmetry axis of the photosphere .",
    "while the models of @xcite may be able to explain loops seen in detached lines like h@xmath0 , the relevance of these models to lines forming closer to the photosphere ( such as ) is less clear .",
    "an additional difficulty is with the amplitude of the polarization modulation .",
    "a polarization of 3.4% in the h@xmath0  line is very high , particularly for a supernova being observed so soon after explosion .",
    "similarly large polarizations ( @xmath76% ) were seen in the trough of the nir triplet in sn 1987a @xcite , but only at late times ( day 100 ) .",
    "@xcite was unable to successfully model such a large line polarization .",
    "he invoked a special excitation asymmetry , especially to explain the differences between h@xmath0  and at that time .",
    "@xcite found similarly high polarization values in the lines in the peculiar sn ib / c 2005bf before maximum light and @xcite observed large ( @xmath77% ) calcium polarizations in sn 2008d .",
    "a common thread is that at the times of large line polarization , the lines in question formed at high velocities and were detached from the photosphere .",
    "evidently , such a high - velocity , detached - shell geometry is quite favorable for the production of significant line polarization .",
    "that the lines showing this effect are frequently due to calcium may just be due to the relative strength of calcium lines in supernova ejecta material at the low densities of most high - velocity material .",
    "one last factor to mention in the context of very strong line - polarization values is deviations of the geometry of the high - velocity material from a spheroid .",
    "partial photospheric obscuration at different velocity surfaces is responsible for the line polarization seen from a detached aspherical shell @xcite , but the polarizing effectiveness is limited by the spheroidal geometry .",
    "if the absorbing material has a geometry far from that of a spheroid , such as a toroid or large clumps , then partial obscuration can very effectively generate large polarizations @xcite .",
    "such non - spheroidal geometries could also result in the appearance of the h@xmath0  line being quite different in strength or velocity along other lines of sight .",
    "the polarization near h@xmath45  is more complicated than at h@xmath0 . on day 6 ,",
    "the locus of points in the @xmath61 plane ( fig .",
    "[ ax_n1lineplot ] ) is not linear or a simple loop .",
    "the long axis of the distribution is largely aligned with the h@xmath0  orientation , but not exactly .",
    "the peak polarization at the absorption minimum , integrated over 4610@xmath74650   , is @xmath78% at a p.a .",
    "of 157@xmath79 , which is slightly different from that at h@xmath0 .",
    "the right - hand panels of figure  [ ax_day6velplot ] show that the polarization peak is centered on the absorption minimum . unlike h@xmath0",
    ", @xmath69  does not go to zero near zero velocity .",
    "instead , @xmath69  remains high at velocities redward of the absorption minimum .",
    "similarly , the polarization in @xmath70  is elevated above zero .",
    "we interpret this behavior as being due to polarization induced by the superposed lines of multiplet 42 , which are visible as the three notches in the total - flux spectrum redward of h@xmath45  in figure  [ ax_day6velplot ] .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2008ax  was undergoing rapid evolution at this time . by our next epoch of spectropolarimetry , day 9 , both the spectrum and polarization near h@xmath45  had changed significantly .",
    "the total - flux spectrum in the right - hand panels of figure  [ ax_day9velplot ] shows that the absorption from h@xmath45  had significantly weakened as the photosphere had receded through the hydrogen envelope .",
    "meanwhile , the neighboring lines had strengthened .",
    "the polarization data points from this region are plotted in the lower - left panel of figure  [ ax_n2lineplot ] .",
    "the polarization feature clearly is no longer oriented similarly to h@xmath0  and prefers another direction which presumably reflects the iron distribution .",
    "the polarization in the core of the h@xmath45  absorption ( integrated over 4630@xmath74680   ) is @xmath80% at a p.a .",
    "of 163@xmath79 , but the polarization angle changes rapidly to the red as the effects of the lines manifest themselves .",
    "the other lines shown in figures  [ ax_n1lineplot ] and [ ax_n2lineplot ] also exhibit loops .",
    "the long axis of the @xmath85876 loop is largely aligned with the continuum and h@xmath0  polarization axis , although the loop is responsible for some deviation from that axis .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation across @xmath85876 is about 0.9% on day 9 .",
    "the polarization peak on day 6 ( 5630@xmath75700   ) has a polarization of @xmath81% at a p.a . of @xmath82 ,",
    "evolving on day 9 ( 5640@xmath75740   ) to a polarization of @xmath83% at a p.a .",
    "of @xmath84 . the p.a . on both nights is consistent with the h@xmath0  and continuum p.a .",
    "the weaker modulations ( @xmath85% ) associated with @xmath86678 and @xmath87065 also appear to be mostly in the direction of @xmath69 , although the lower significance of those features prevents us from studying any substructure .",
    "the loop formed by the nir triplet feature on day 9 is clearly not aligned with any other ion in the spectrum or with the continuum .",
    "this result is independent of any isp subtraction or rotation of coordinates .",
    "the relatively small wavelength dependence of isp means that isp subtraction approximates a shift of the origin of the @xmath61 plane .",
    "the differing behaviors of h@xmath0  and the nir triplet can also be seen in the uncorrected @xmath53 and @xmath54 spectropolarimetry plotted in the right - hand panel of figure  [ ax_rawpolplot ] . while the h@xmath0  trough polarization deviates from the continuum polarization in the positive @xmath53 , negative @xmath54 direction , the nir triplet absorption deviates in the negative @xmath53 , negative @xmath54 direction .",
    "the net polarization modulation , or the length of the long axis of the loop , is about 1.3% .",
    "a small polarization increase is evident in the @xmath87774 absorption trough in figure  [ ax_day9rotplot ] , although the noise is too high relative to the amplitude of the feature to see a loop if one were present .",
    "the integrated polarization over the 7550@xmath77700    interval is ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) = ( 0.97% , 0.03% ) , with error bars of 0.06% on each stokes parameter .",
    "this means that the polarization in the oxygen absorption is elevated by 0.33% above the continuum level , but has the same p.a .    in summary ,",
    "the hydrogen , helium , and oxygen lines in sn  2008ax  all have largely consistent orientations ( ignoring the small modulations in @xmath70  due to the loops ) , which they share with the continuum at red wavelengths .",
    "it is natural to identify this angle with the symmetry axis of the supernova ejecta .",
    "calcium and iron appear to have different orientations .",
    "sn  2008ax  is not unique in this respect @xcite , which we will discuss further below .      we have also corrected our late - time spectropolarimetry for isp , but we have chosen a new coordinate system to present the data .",
    "regions of high continuum polarization are evident in figure  [ ax_latepolplot ] between the nebular emission lines .",
    "we chose two such regions on either side of the nir triplet , 7850@xmath78250    and 8850@xmath79150   , and integrated the isp - subtracted stokes parameters .",
    "we obtained polarization angles of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "we chose to rotate our new coordinate system ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) to this preferred axis ( weighted average of 174@xmath223 ) and plotted the data in figure  [ ax_laterotplot ] .",
    "this method places most of the highest continuum polarization peaks into @xmath88 .",
    "if we had used the other rotated coordinate system , @xmath70  would have shown large deviations from zero .",
    "the basic pattern of high continuum polarization still holds in @xmath88 .",
    "the region of highest polarization is our continuum window of 8850@xmath79150   , which has a net isp - corrected polarization of @xmath90% , indicative of large asphericities in the inner core of the sn ejecta .",
    "the polarization dips down to nearly zero at the wavelengths of strong emission lines by construction due to our choice for the isp .    curiously , the polarization at bluer wavelengths is nearly zero in @xmath88 , but is systematically negative in @xmath89 .",
    "the integrated polarization over 5050@xmath75950    ( approximating the @xmath55 band ) is @xmath91% at a p.a .",
    "( prior to rotation ) of @xmath92 .",
    "is completely consistent with that of the continuum polarization angle measured on day 9 and used to rotate into our original ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) coordinates , but is inconsistent with the p.a . in our redder continuum windows .",
    "usually the consistency of the continuum polarization angle from early to late times would be interpreted as resulting from a single axis of symmetry in the ejecta , but the rotation of the continuum polarization angle with wavelength at late times shows that the inner ejecta do not have a simple axisymmetric geometry .",
    "while such a rotation is potentially a symptom of poor isp removal , the substantial scatter in the @xmath61 plane we observe shows that no single isp could align the wavelength - dependent continuum angle .",
    "perhaps the continuum polarization angle at late times is affected by individual clumps of @xmath44ni producing regions of enhanced electron scattering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55-band polarization angle could also be modified by the spatial distribution of the iron lines mostly responsible for the pseudocontinuum at those wavelengths .",
    "lastly , we note that one potential alternative method for determining the isp would be to assume that the polarization at blue wavelengths is nearly zero at late times under the hypothesis that the large amount of opacity should result in complete depolarization of the continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the low @xmath55-band polarization we do measure after subtraction of our preferred isp shows that this method would result in only a slightly different isp subtraction .",
    "if we had used the late - time @xmath55-band polarization to measure the isp and then rotated our early - time data into a coordinate system aligned with the day 9 continuum polarization , there would be a few negative consequences .",
    "specifically , the h@xmath0  line polarizations in our new @xmath69  vector would be somewhat offset such that the polarization peaks in the absorption troughs would still be at positive values of @xmath69  but the polarization at the line peaks would be at negative values of @xmath69 .",
    "such a polarization profile is certainly possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we prefer the result of our chosen isp making the polarization of the emission - line peaks at late times and in the h@xmath0  peaks at early times nearly zero . a small residual polarization in the @xmath55 band at late times may indicate that the iron responsible for the line opacity and depolarization of the continuum might not be physically located exterior to the continuum formation region and is instead cospatial with the scattering electrons such that some polarized flux can escape to the distant observer .",
    "the well - sampled spectroscopic sequences presented in  3 and by p08 and @xcite demonstrate that sn  2008ax  made a transition from the hydrogen - dominated spectra of a sn ii to the helium - dominated spectra of a sn ib , reflecting a progenitor that had lost most but not all of its hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "a key question is how much hydrogen the progenitor retained at the time of explosion .",
    "the progenitor system of the prototypical sn iib 1993j has been directly detected @xcite and determined to have been a k - type supergiant interacting with a b - type supergiant companion .",
    "the direct observations of the progenitor of sn  2008ax  are still ambiguous due to possible contamination from other stars and await final , late - time template images @xcite .",
    "however , the progenitor of sn  2008ax  was probably not similar to that of sn 1993j , and was either an even more highly stripped star in an interacting binary ( superposed on a stellar cluster ) or a wr star with a small residual hydrogen envelope ( a wnl / wnh star ; crockett et al .",
    "2008 ) , although @xcite argue that the wnh stars are still undergoing core h burning .",
    "the wr progenitor model may also have difficulty in explaining the shape of the bolometric light curve of sn  2008ax  @xcite . @xcite",
    "have recently proposed that sn  2008ax  is one of a group of sne  iib coming from compact wr - like progenitors , while sn  1993j is the exemplar of a different class of sne  iib which appear to come from more extended progenitors .",
    "@xcite observed modulations in the radio light curve of the sn iib 2001ig which they attributed to the interaction between the wr wind of the progenitor and a hot companion , a conclusion reinforced when @xcite found a supergiant star at the location of the supernova long after explosion , which they identified as the companion to the progenitor .",
    "@xcite instead preferred to interpret the variations in the radio light curve as signs of a variable wind from a single massive wr star .",

    "these observations were mostly taken at early phases , when the photosphere was in the hydrogen - rich outer envelope , while our sn  2008ax  data were taken when the photosphere was starting to recede through the helium core .",
    "@xcite found that the spectropolarimetry of sn 2001ig changed dramatically at a similar phase .",
    "we have compared our day 9 spectropolarimetry to sn 1993j @xcite in figure  [ ax_93jcompplot ] .",
    "the epoch of the sn 1993j observations was chosen to roughly match the strength of the lines with sn  2008ax  so that the photosphere would be at an approximately similar depth with respect to the helium - rich core .",
    "the first thing to note from the comparison in figure  [ ax_93jcompplot ] is that the polarization near 6600    in the peak of the h@xmath0  line is almost zero in sn  2008ax , as discussed above , but is @xmath98% in sn 1993j .",
    "this reflects the different assumptions used by @xcite to correct their sn 1993j data for isp . choosing a different isp for sn 1993j could lower the overall level of polarization , including the amplitudes of the peaks at the line features , and thus the inferred level of asphericity @xcite .",
    "the line features in the sn  2008ax  data are already clearly stronger than in sn 1993j , particularly at h@xmath0  and the h@xmath45/ blend .",
    "@xcite found that their spectra and spectropolarimetry of the sn iib 1996cb closely resembled those of sn 1993j and proposed that the objects had similar geometries oriented similarly with respect to our line of sight .",
    "they wondered if sne iib were a homogeneous subclass and whether those objects would have appeared differently from a different viewing angle .",
    "@xcite presented a single epoch of spectropolarimetry of the sn iib 2003ed and found that it was also broadly similar to sn 1993j .",
    "the sn 2001ig data of @xcite have some similarity to sn 1993j , but are more distinct than the other objects .    to the extent that our spectropolarimetry of sn  2008ax  resembles that of sn  1993j",
    ", it may be a result of the same basic phenomenon ( overlapping inverted p - cygni line polarization profiles ) in objects with similar spectral features .",
    "thus , the similarity between the spectropolarimetry of sne 1993j and 1996cb noted by @xcite may simply be a consequence of the close spectroscopic resemblance between those two objects @xcite .",
    "sn 2001ig was quite spectroscopically distinct from sn 1993j @xcite and had somewhat different polarimetry .",
    "as shown in  3 , sn  2008ax  is the least spectroscopically similar of these objects , and so the fact that it has the most distinct polarimetry might have been expected . furthermore , the speculation of @xcite about the appearance of sne iib from different lines of sight will be directly tested in one case due to the discovery of light echoes @xcite around the galactic sn iib cas  a @xcite , which have enabled the study of that explosion from different vantage points @xcite . if the high h@xmath0  polarization we see in sn  2008ax  is due to large clumps or a special geometry , the appearance of the h@xmath0  line could be quite different along other lines of sight .",
    "indeed , @xcite have found that the h@xmath0  velocity of the cas  a supernova was higher along one line of sight compared to others that they studied .",
    "our analysis of the full spectral evolution of sn  2008ax  (  3 ) found that the object was more similar to normal sne ib than to sn 1993j , so it is of interest to compare to the spectropolarimetry of those objects as well .",
    "unfortunately , sne ib are not as well represented in the literature .",
    "after the first detection of possible intrinsic sn polarization in the sn ib 1983n @xcite , the next sne ib observed spectropolarimetrically were sne 1997dq and 1998 t , both of which had substantial ( @xmath99% ) line - polarization features @xcite .",
    "however , none of those observations have been published .",
    "the only comparison sne ib are the unique sn ib / c 2005bf @xcite and sn 2008d @xcite .",
    "the sn ib / c 2005bf had many unusual and unique photometric and spectroscopic properties @xcite . however , our automated comparisons using snid in  3 found it to be the closest spectral match to sn  2008ax  near maximum light .",
    "single epochs of spectropolarimetry were obtained 6 days before @xcite and 8 days after @xcite maximum light .",
    "the early observations of @xcite show very large polarizations in the troughs of the h&k and nir triplet absorptions ( @xmath76% ) , with smaller ( @xmath100% ) features present at the @xmath85876 and lines .",
    "the line features decreased in strength by the time of the observations of @xcite , but at both epochs @xmath61 loops were observed in the and lines .",
    "one result common to the spectropolarimetry of sn 2005bf @xcite and sn 2008d @xcite is that the line features did not share an axis of symmetry .",
    "the loops observed in almost all well - detected lines show that the individual features have velocity - dependent angle rotations , but the overall range of angles occupied by the lines is different for different species .",
    "even the same lines observed at different epochs show rotations as the photosphere recedes .",
    "in particular ,",
    "the , , and lines show misaligned polarization angles in both objects .",
    "if the polarization feature near 4700    in our day 9 data is mostly due to , then our sn  2008ax  data show exactly the same phenomenon ( fig .",
    "[ ax_n2lineplot ] ) .",
    "interestingly , our @xmath85876 data are largely aligned with both the continuum and line - polarization angles of h@xmath0  and oxygen at that date .",
    "the continuum polarization we measure on day 9 ( @xmath62% ) is higher than that determined by @xcite for sn 2008d ( @xmath101% ) and @xcite for sn 2005bf at early times ( @xmath102% ) , although @xcite show that different isp assumptions for sn 2005bf could increase that value to @xmath103% . in the context of the oblate spheroidal models of @xcite",
    ", our sn  2008ax  continuum polarization implies that the photosphere on day 9 has a minimum axis ratio of about 1.15:1 .",
    "if we take the polarization in our reddest continuum window on day 99 ( 1.28% ) as representative of the late - time continuum photosphere , then the minimum asphericity in the core rose to @xmath335% .    also of interest to us",
    "is the evidence presented by @xcite of only small polarization increases ( @xmath104% ) associated with the high - velocity balmer absorptions in sn 2005bf .",
    "while our early - time spectropolarimetry of sn  2008ax  showed very large polarization modulations across h@xmath0 , we were unable to obtain spectropolarimetry near maximum light .",
    "at that time , the h@xmath0  line was significantly weaker and sn  2008ax  resembled normal sne ib with a strong 6300    feature .",
    "an interesting question for future research is the time evolution of polarization modulations at h@xmath0  in other stripped - envelope sne . if the spectroscopic similarities between sn  2008ax  and sn 2005bf are meaningful , then perhaps future sne ib observed near maximum light will also show weak h@xmath0  polarization even if the line were strongly polarized at early times , due to the decreased photospheric covering fraction or optical depth at late times . in this context , it is interesting to note that @xcite found a peak in the polarization ( @xmath105% ) of sn 2008d at 6260   , which they observed was at a rather red wavelength to be associated with the @xmath86355 absorption and tentatively suggested that it instead may have been due to weak high - velocity h@xmath0  absorption at @xmath10617,050 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the nebular - phase oxygen line profiles presented in  3.4 are asymmetric and some lines show multiple peaks . in particular , the double - peaked structure of the ] @xmath84571 emission line is strong evidence against the possibility of a largely blueshifted inner oxygen distribution , which was one possibility explored by @xcite . instead",
    ", the multi - peaked line profiles are likely a sign that models which invoke a clumpy inner oxygen distribution are more correct . clumping due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been invoked in the past to explain the multi - peaked line profiles observed in other stripped - envelope sne , including sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "the continuum polarization of 1.28% observed in the early nebular phase is also a sign that the inner ejecta of sn  2008ax  were highly aspherical .",
    "spectral modeling is necessary to determine how much of the polarization we measure at late times is due to global asphericities versus clumping in the ejecta .    our spectra of sn  2008ax  as it entered the nebular phase show the strong oxygen and calcium lines expected of an object that will develop into an oxygen - rich supernova remnant , while our earliest optical spectra demonstrated that a small amount of hydrogen was present in the outer layers of the ejecta .",
    "these properties are strongly reminiscent of the galactic supernova remnant cas  a @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified fast - moving nitrogen - rich ejecta knots that probably represent the outermost layers of the progenitor , which apparently were composed of a small amount of hydrogen , much like a wn star , and similar to one of the potential progenitor models for sn  2008ax .",
    "the discovery by @xcite that the spectrum of the supernova explosion giving rise to cas  a was similar to that of sn 1993j only strengthens the relevance of sn  2008ax  to cas  a. similarly , @xcite identified cas  a as a possible analog for sn 2005bf .",
    "however , @xcite identified cas  a as a member of the sn  1993j - like sne iib with extended progenitors , while sn  2008ax was a representative of their class of sne iib from compact progenitors .    optical and x - ray studies of emission from the ejecta of cas  a have shown dramatic compositional inhomogeneities on all scales , from small optical knots @xcite to the full remnant @xcite .",
    "iron - rich ejecta from the core have penetrated and overturned the silicon - rich layer that was situated above them in the progenitor @xcite , while not penetrating the overlying oxygen - rich ejecta @xcite .",
    "the overall appearance of the remnant is very aspherical and turbulent , with silicon - rich `` jets '' @xcite .",
    "the lack of a simple , well - defined symmetry axis in our early - time spectropolarimetry of sn  2008ax , along with the differing polarization angles associated with different chemical elements and the multi - peaked nebular line profiles , appears unsurprising in the context of the complex morphology of cas  a. we note that some evolution after explosion has occurred in that remnant due to deceleration by the surrounding gas @xcite , and possibly also by energy input from radioactive decay @xcite .",
    "cas  a should give pause to anyone attempting to interpret the geometry of distant sn explosions such as sn  2008ax  in a smooth , quasi - spherical or axially - symmetric fashion .",
    "@xcite have attempted to piece together a coherent picture of the cas  a observations in the context of a jet - induced explosion .",
    "this detailed study of sn  2008ax  was made possible by the luck of a robotic sn search taking an image of the nearby host galaxy only hours after shock breakout from the sn @xcite , with the further luck that the image obtained by another observer was able to bracket the time of explosion so tightly @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the fortuitous discovery of the x - ray burst accompanying sn 2008d @xcite , which allowed numerous groups to obtain detailed follow - up observations of that sn ib starting soon after explosion @xcite . only with the early discovery of sne",
    "can we hope to obtain crucial spectral information about the outer atmospheres of their progenitor stars .",
    "our first spectrum of sn  2008ax , taken only two days after shock breakout , is one of the earliest spectra of a supernova ever obtained and does not resemble any of the spectra of other core - collapse sne observed at such early times .",
    "strong and deep balmer absorptions were present , extending to very high velocities ( @xmath10733,000 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "we have presented an extensive sequence of optical and nir spectra of sn  2008ax  in  3 .",
    "our optical spectra were taken with a relatively high cadence during the first week after explosion and capture the very rapid spectroscopic evolution at early times .",
    "the progenitor of sn  2008ax  had only a very low - mass hydrogen envelope , so the balmer lines faded on the rise to maximum light and optical lines started to become prominent ( see also p08 ) .",
    "this spectroscopic transition defines sne iib .",
    "our nir spectra , starting only 10 days after shock breakout , showed little evidence of hydrogen and were dominated by the helium lines expected in a sn ib .",
    "@xcite found that the spectra of many sne ib exhibited an absorption near 6300    and presented arguments in favor of an identification with h@xmath0 .",
    "our early optical spectra of sn  2008ax  show unambiguous balmer lines , with the h@xmath0  absorption smoothly evolving into an absorption near 6270   . by maximum light ,",
    "the optical - through - nir spectra very closely resembled those of the sn ib  1999ex . if the first spectrum of sn  2008ax  had not been taken until maximum light or shortly afterwards , as is typical of most supernovae , it likely would have been classified as a sn ib with some hydrogen absorption , as were a few of our comparison objects ( fig .",
    "[ ax_heiplot ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the distinction between sne iib and ib may in part depend on the quality and timing of spectroscopic observations .",
    "the case of sn  1993j was not ambiguous because that object had a sufficiently thick hydrogen envelope for h@xmath0  to be clearly present at all times .",
    "at the other extreme , the sn ib 2008d was observed very shortly after explosion and never showed the strong balmer absorptions seen in sn  2008ax  ( fig .",
    "[ ax_earlyplot ] ) . however , most of the other objects plotted in figure  [ ax_heiplot ] appear to be intermediate between those two , and the distinction between those objects spectroscopically classified as sne ib and as sne iib may not be physically meaningful .",
    "if the sne ib had been observed as soon after explosion as sn  2008ax , then many of them likely would also have been classified as sne iib . our nir spectral sequence of sn  2008ax  ( fig .",
    "[ ax_irplot ] ) and the radio light curves of @xcite also support a closer correspondence of sn  2008ax  to typical sne  ib than to sn 1993j , despite the prominence of optical hydrogen lines at early times .    these observations of sn  2008ax  support the suggestion of @xcite that the spectra of objects classified as sne ib frequently exhibit some h@xmath0  absorption .",
    "therefore , the progenitors of many sne ib must explode with some hydrogen in their outer envelopes .",
    "the processes that consistently lead to such a small , but nonzero , amount of hydrogen in the outer envelope before explosion are not understood , and represent a challenge for stellar evolution models .",
    "resolution of the ambiguities in the direct detection of the progenitor of sn  2008ax  @xcite , along with studies of the progenitors of future stripped - envelope sne , will help clarify the situation .",
    "our three epochs of spectropolarimetry and the nebular line profiles demonstrate that sn  2008ax  showed strong asphericities starting shortly after explosion and continuing until the early nebular phase .",
    "the 3.4% polarization feature at h@xmath0  on day 9 was unusually strong and may indicate that the appearance of the h@xmath0  absorption could depend on the viewing orientation with respect to the object .",
    "after correction for isp , the hydrogen , helium , and oxygen distributions were found to be largely aligned with the continuum axis of symmetry , while the iron and calcium lines exhibited strong deviations from this axial symmetry .",
    "all lines with sufficiently good detections also showed loops in the @xmath61 plane indicative of velocity - dependent angle rotations of unknown origin .",
    "these deviations from axisymmetry appear to be common in stripped - envelope sne , but their cause is mysterious .",
    "detailed spectral synthesis , including polarization , of explosion models is necessary to understand whether those models are capable of reproducing these observations .",
