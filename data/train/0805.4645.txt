    "the majority of stars form in self gravitating cores within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "two important issues facing modern theories of star formation are the nature of turbulence in these clouds and the relative inefficiency of star formation . for excellent reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "these two issues are likely to be related .",
    "the star formation rate per free fall ( @xmath3 ) can be defined as the fraction of mass that is converted into stars within one free fall time at the mean density @xmath4 @xcite . in the absence of some form of support",
    ", most of the mass in gmc s would collapse into stars within a free fall time @xmath5^{1/2}$ ] giving an @xmath6 .",
    "observations however find surprisingly low values of @xmath3 s ( typically ranging from .01 to .1 ) .",
    "theoretical accounts for the low values of @xmath3 will rely on some form of support within the cloud to keep it from collapsing to form stars .",
    "supersonic turbulence is one means by which this can be achieved .",
    "turbulence in molecular clouds is inferred from larson s laws which are empirical relationships between line - widths and size observed in many star forming regions @xcite .",
    "turbulence has also been inferred from direct measurements of power spectra in molecular clouds across a wide range of scales @xcite . while turbulence can provide an isotropic pressure to support the cloud against self - gravity , both hydrodynamic and mhd turbulence decay quickly @xcite .",
    "thus if clouds are stable , long - lived structures supported against self - gravitational collapse by turbulence , those turbulent motions must be continually driven either internally via gravitational collapse and stellar feedback or externally via turbulence in the ism .",
    "feedback in the form of stellar outflows is one means of driving turbulence in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "if outflows are well coupled to the cloud then observational studies make it clear that combined outflow energy budgets are sufficient to account for cloud turbulent energy @xcite . analytical work by @xcite has explored the role of collimated outflow feedback on clouds .",
    "@xcite , in particular , developed a theory for outflow driven turbulence in which line - widths were predicted as functions of a global outflow momentum injection rate .",
    "@xcite have also considered the nature of feedback via outflows , concluding that these systems provide an important source of internal driving in dense star forming cores .",
    "early simulation studies also indicated that outflows could drive turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "more recent work by @xcite and @xcite have mapped out the complex interplay between star formation and turbulence concluding that outflows could re - energize turbulence .",
    "however , studies of single jets by @xcite came to the opposite conclusion in the sense that single jets will not leave enough supersonic material in their wakes to act as a relevant source of internal forcing .    in this letter",
    "we address the issue of outflow driven turbulence by focusing solely on the dynamics of cloud material set in motion by multiple transient collimated jets .",
    "we use a higher resolution of the outflows than previous studies to tease out the role of their dynamics in driving turbulence . following the dimensional analysis of @xcite we consider a cloud of mean density @xmath7 , with outflows occurring at a rate per volume @xmath8 with momentum @xmath9 .",
    "this then defines characteristic outflow scales of mass , length , and time : @xmath10 combining these gives other characteristic quantities .",
    "of particular interest is the characteristic velocity : @xmath11 assuming typical values for @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 yields supersonic characteristic velocities indicating that outflows contain enough momentum to drive significant supersonic turbulence .",
    "our simulations seek to explore a detailed realization of this idea .",
    "we note that these relations are for spherical outflows and provide appropriate order of magnitude estimates for collimated outflows .",
    "this work is the continuation of a series of studies on outflows and turbulence . in @xcite observations of dense gas in ngc 1333 showed numerous fossil outflow cavities with total energy and momenta consistent with re - energizing turbulence @xcite .",
    "most recently @xcite have carried out simulations of a single outflow cavity interacting with a turbulent medium .",
    "they conclude that outflow driven cavities are able to re - energize turbulent motions in their immediate environment provided such turbulent motions already exist to disrupt the cavity . here",
    "we numerically investigate the degree to which interacting outflow cavities are able to provide such a turbulent environment in regions typical of star forming clusters .",
    "future studies will include treatment of additional physics including magnetic fields ( carroll in prep . ) , self - gravity and radiation transport .",
    "we note the studies are relevant to broader question of turbulence driven by continuous vs discrete forcing @xcite    in section  [ numerical_model ] we describe the numerical model and the properties of individual outflows , in section  [ results ] we discuss the characteristics of outflow driven turbulence , and in section  [ conclusion ] we summarize the implications of outflow driven turbulence within molecular clouds .",
    "in this study we use a new reimann solving mhd code called astrocub .",
    "the code is 2nd order accurate in space and time and uses a non - split ctu method as described by @xcite .",
    "our current simulations were purely hydrodynamic and were performed on a periodic cube of length 1.5 pc for 1 myr at a resolution of @xmath12 using a polytropic equation of state ( @xmath13 ) to approximate an isothermal gas at 10 k. highly collimated bipolar outflows of momentum @xmath14 g cm s@xmath15 were launched at a constant rate @xmath16 @xmath17 s@xmath15 into an initially uniform environment of density @xmath18 g @xmath17 .",
    "the values for @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7 were chosen to approximate star forming regions like ngc1333 . using the scaling relations above , these define outflow scales of length @xmath19 , mass @xmath20 , and time @xmath21 .",
    "the simulation domain was chosen to be 4 times the outflow length scale so the corresponding outflow wave number @xmath22 where @xmath23 corresponds to the scale of the box .",
    "outflows were continually launched for 3 times the outflow time scale for a total of @xmath24 outflows launched during the simulation .",
    "the turbulence was then allowed to decay for another 3.7 myr which corresponds to 2.4 dynamical times ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in addition to the outflow - driven turbulence case we also carried forward a `` standard '' isotropically forced turbulence simulation as a control case . in this",
    "simulation turbulent motions where imposed at each timestep using a series of sinusoidal driving functions with an `` injection '' or `` driving '' scale of @xmath26    each outflow was launched with a @xmath27 half opening angle from a region 10 cells across corresponding to an outflow radius of 5800 au .",
    "the velocity , density , and duration of each jet were modeled on a @xmath28 star ejecting one - sixth of its mass at a velocity of 240 km / s giving @xmath29=40 km / s .",
    "the mass loss rate was chosen to be @xmath30m@xmath31/yr giving a jet density of .21@xmath7 and duration of .83 kyr .",
    "the actual outflows injected less momentum ( 80% ) and about twice the mass , however the total mass injected by all 192 outflows amounts to less than 3% of the ambient material and does not have a significant effect on the overall dynamics .",
    "( left ) , and at @xmath32 ( center ) as well as for the isotropically forced turbulence ( right ) .",
    "note the interaction of outflow shells at early times ( left ) and the presence of distinct `` holes '' in the turbulent density distribution at later times ( center ) .",
    "( the colorbars for the outflow driven turbulence and the isotropically forced turbulence cover the ranges [ .05 - 20]@xmath7 and [ .1 - 10]@xmath7 respectively ) ]",
    "figure [ logdcc ] shows density cross cuts from both the outflow driven and isotropically driven control simulations .",
    "examination of the outflow driven simulation shows that initially outflow cavities are able to expand into the quiescent environment without being disrupted and easily grow to pc size structures .",
    "since the outflows are bipolar , the total vector momentum injected by each outflow is zero , however , the total scalar momentum defined as @xmath33 grows steadily until the cavity interactions begin to dissipate momentum in the expanding shells .",
    "by @xmath34 the cavities have entirely filled the domain and by @xmath35 the system has reached a statistically quasi - steady state .",
    "comparison of the late time outflow driven simulation image and the isotropically forced simulation image show that both have reached states of highly disordered flows with structure present on a variety of scales . as we show below the visual impression of turbulence in both cases",
    "is supported by statistical measures of the flows as well as their time evolution .",
    "the comparison by visual inspection however is noteworthy because of the `` holes '' which appear in the outflow driven density distribution .",
    "these are created by fossil outflow cavities and exist until the cavities are subsumed by the turbulent motions @xcite or interact with another cavity .",
    "such shells have been observed in turbulent flows around star forming regions such as ngc1333 @xcite and point to an important morphological , rather than statistical , signature of outflow driven turbulence .    in figure",
    "[ 2dpdfs ] we show a plot ( upper left panel ) of the average scalar momentum density vs time .",
    "the scalar momentum density and time have been scaled to @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "initially the scalar momentum density injection rate is @xmath38 since the jets are not interacting . around @xmath39",
    "the expanding cavities begin to interact and scalar momentum begins to be dissipated . by @xmath40 the momentum dissipation rate balances the momentum injection rate and the system reaches a steady state .",
    "the average mass weighted velocity in our simulation is very close to @xmath41 corresponding to mach 4.8 or @xmath42 at @xmath35 the jets are turned off , and the scalar momentum density dissipation rate is shown to be approximately @xmath43 .    figure [ 2dpdfs ] also show the time development of the two - dimensional probability density functions for the gas density and mach number .",
    "the jets have stirred up all of the ambient material by @xmath44 and have reached a statistically steady state by @xmath45 .",
    "the steady state density and velocity pdf s are fairly log normal apart from the spikes associated with low density , high velocity material from successive outflow cavities . once the jets are turned off at @xmath35 the turbulence decays fairly rapidly .",
    "note that by @xmath46 the pdf s show no evidence of the expanding outflow cavities and are characteristic of a purely turbulent isotropic media .",
    "the development of log - normal density distributions in isothermal conditions is one measure of a turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "the four panels in figure  [ 2dpdfs ] demonstrate one of the key conclusions of our study : _ transient outflow cavities can set the bulk of initially quiescent material into random but statistically steady supersonic motions .",
    "_    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     consideration of the right hand panel of figure  [ spectra ] demonstrates that the spectrum of the outflow driven turbulence is quite different from the isotropically forced turbulence . at large scales ,",
    "the outflow driven spectrum rises slowly with @xmath47 from the box scale to around @xmath48 in a broad maximum before turning over and steepening to @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "the power law behavior continues all the way to the dissipation scale .",
    "the isotropically forced spectrum shows a sharp peak at the driving scale and then falls with shallower power law appropriate to a burgers model for compressible turbulence in which the random distribution of shocks gives a spectrum with @xmath51 without regard to the cascade of energy as in kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "@xcite suggested that a cascade of momentum in supersonic turbulence would also produce a @xmath52 .",
    "the reason for the difference between the outflow driven turbulent spectra and the spectra expected to be produced by shock - filled turbulence as well as a momentum cascade model , lies in the nature of the driving .",
    "since the shocks in the outflow driven turbulence are not randomly distributed ( i.e. opposing bow shocks associated with bipolar outflows ) , the turbulence though shock - dominated , should not be expected to follow a burgers model power law .",
    "in addition , because the turbulent turnover time scale at the outflow scale @xmath53 is equivalent to the time scale for an outflow to clear out a region of volume @xmath54 , the spectrum at scales below the outflow scale @xmath55 would not be expected to follow a momentum type cascade model either .",
    "the steep spectrum at sub outflow scales ( with @xmath1 corresponding to a velocity length scaling @xmath56 ) is consistent with the hubble type flow seen in the expanding cavities .",
    "the time evolution of the spectra ( for many outflows ) shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ spectra ] provides some insight .",
    "the steep slope of the spectrum at sub - outflow scales is present already by @xmath57 before the outflows have begun to significantly interact .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that the steep slope of the spectrum at later times @xmath35 arises from the volume swept - up by the multiple fossil outflow cavities rather than their interaction . in other words",
    ", we can interpret the steep spectra as due to expanding outflows that sweep up small - scale ( high @xmath58 ) eddies which effectively removes them from the flow .",
    "this effect would reduce the observed power on these scales and steepen the slope of the energy spectrum .      in order to clarify the behavior of outflow driven turbulence ,",
    "a single outflow simulation was run . in the right hand panel of figure  [ spectra ]",
    "we present the development of the velocity power spectra for this single jet .",
    "the six snapshots are equally spaced in log time . for each line the velocity power spectra peaks at approximately the outflow length scale which grows in time .",
    "note the slight secondary plateau at the outflow width scale .",
    "as the expanding cavity grows , the total kinetic energy decreases , and the energy shifts to larger scales . for an expanding outflow in a quiescent medium",
    "there is , of course , nothing to limit the growth .",
    "outflows in a turbulent medium however , will loose coherence when the momentum in the outflow is comparable to the turbulent momentum swept up by the expanding cavity .",
    "this statement is equivalent to the fact that once the outflows reach the scale @xmath59 they interact and are destroyed , converting their directed motion up to random motion . for spherical outflows , this will happen on scales @xmath60 .",
    "collimated outflows would in theory be able to grow to larger size structures before loosing coherence , however the momentum in the expanding sides of the cavities can be comparable to that in the head of the jet .",
    "in fact we find that after 1 , 2 , & 3 @xmath37 , the transverse momentum accounts for 30% , 40% , & 50% of the total momentum respectively .",
    "so a driving scale @xmath61 is still a fairly good approximation .",
    "one would expect the spectrum to fall off steeply for scales above the driving scale @xmath62 .",
    "both panels in figure  [ spectra ] however , show that multiple outflows inject their energy over a broad range of scales , and while each outflow injects most of its energy at @xmath63 , the shorter turnover times for scales closer to @xmath59 cause the spectra to flatten making identification of a single outflow driving scale difficult . to address this issue we consider combining a power law forcing function @xmath64 with a power law energy spectrum @xmath65 and a dissipation rate to smaller scales @xmath66 . with these relations",
    "we can look for the steady state solution for the energy at each scale :    @xmath67    using the above assumptions this equation implies @xmath68 .",
    "in other words , for @xmath69 a forcing function with a positive slope will result in an energy spectrum that would have a negative slope in the forcing region .",
    "this is likely the case in our simulations for scales close to , but shorter than , our nominal driving scale .",
    "recall that at the largest scales we found the outflow turbulent spectra had a positive slope with @xmath47 ) . here",
    "a relatively steep forcing function @xmath70 could peak at @xmath60 but reproduce the observed energy spectrum at @xmath71 .",
    "thus while our simulations do not begin with a specified forcing function and simply allow the interactions of outflow cavities to self - consistently establish a turbulent flow we can still draw broad conclusions about the spectral nature of the imposed forcing .",
    "there have been many simulations of turbulence in both the atomic and molecular ism @xcite . some of these focus on decaying turbulence while others explore driven turbulence . in the majority of these studies",
    "the turbulence is forced with a continuous , isotropic and predetermined spectra . in this paper",
    "we have focused on turbulence in sub - volumes of molecular clouds and considered the more realistic case of discrete , non - isotropic forcing in physical space rather than fourier space .",
    "our goal has been to address the ability of transient protostellar outflows , ( _ fossil cavities _ ) , to drive their surrounding media into supersonic turbulent motions .",
    "our results show conclusively that for reasonable values of outflow momenta @xmath9 and outflow rate per unit volume @xmath8 , outflows generate supersonic turbulence . we have found that the spectrum and physical properties of outflow driven supersonic turbulence differ from that produced by isotropic random forcing .",
    "we note first that we are able to broadly identify an outflow forcing scale @xmath59 which is of order of magnitude comparable with that predicted by @xcite .",
    "while the density pdf s are log - normal consistent with a isothermal turbulent flow @xcite , the spectra of outflow driven turbulence on scales smaller than @xmath59 is steeper then that expected from turbulent cascade model as in isotropically forced turbulence .",
    "we interpret this to be the result of overlapping outflow cavities preventing smaller scale structures from forming thereby facilitating a sort of bottleneck .",
    "the small scale spectrum is therefore dominated by the spectrum of outflows cavities themselves which follow a power law consistent with a hubble type flow . the departure from @xmath72",
    "velocity power spectra has been seen in other models with discrete forcing in the form of sn driven turbulence in the ism @xcite . in those models",
    "a broad shallow plateau associated at large scales was found which then turned over to a steep spectrum at smaller scales which was attributed to numerical dissipation .",
    "our results add weight to the argument that protostellar outflows can play a significant role in altering their star - forming environments @xcite .",
    "one must be careful not to over - interpret the current simulations which do not include a number of important physical processes such as magnetic fields and self - gravity .",
    "our goal in this initial study was to focus on one key aspect of the physics at work in low mass star forming environments ( multiple transient protostellar outflows ) in order explicate its mechanisms and energetics .",
    "the role of self - gravity , in particular , is likely to be important in determining the final turbulent state of the gas @xcite and magnetic fields may be able to transmit energy from regions of protostellar outflow to broader regions of the cloud @xcite . in spite of these important caveats ,",
    "our results clearly establish a baseline for understanding how outflows can strongly effect stellar birth in clusters which are , after all , the regions where stars actually form .",

    "hector arce , john bally , pat hartigan and tom ray were also generous with their time .",
