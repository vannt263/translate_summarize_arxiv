    "chandra _ and _ spitzer _ observations . by considering a sample of sources that reaches into the quasar regime ,",
    "the @xcite relation does a much better job at determining the x - ray to mid - ir ratio of luminous agn .",
    "however , there is a systematic problem with the mid - ir luminosities of the lowest luminosity agn being high , most likely due to host galaxy contamination within the _ spitzer _ beam .",
    "@xcite present an x - ray study of a sample of 44 mid - ir bright ( @xmath72  mjy ) objects with extreme mid - ir - to - optical flux ratios ( @xmath73 ) selected from an area of @xmath74 of the @xmath75  wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey with  or  coverage . by selection ,",
    "the sample is biased towards obscured agn , and their x - ray to mid - ir correlation , presented in figure  1 , was derived from the swire sample as well as additional type  2 quasars from the literature , where the intrinsic x - ray luminosities were derived from x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "perhaps unsurprising given the mid - ir selection bias to this sample , the @xcite relation is slightly offset towards decreased x - ray luminosity ( or increased mid - ir luminosity ) relative to the other relations plotted in figure  1 .",
    "we derive a new x - ray to mid - ir relation using the data sets from  2 , which span accurate measurements of these quantities from low luminosity (  2.4 ) to high luminosity (  2.1 ) .",
    "the sample also includes several agn samples of intermediate luminosity . doing a least - square polynomial fit to the data",
    ", we derive @xmath76 where @xmath67(2 - 10  kev ) is in units of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if we were to require the non - local samples to have x - ray luminosities @xmath79",
    "so as to avoid sources with possible host galaxy contributions to their mid - ir emission , the relation would be essentially unchanged ( changes @xmath80 dex ; , smaller than the dispersion in the relation shown in figure  2 ) over the range of interest .",
    "several prior analyses have considered how the optical and x - ray luminosities of agn scale over a wide range of agn power ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such relations are typically discussed with reference to the parameter @xmath81 , defined by @xcite as the slope of a nominal power law connecting the rest - frame 2500    and 2  kev monochromatic luminosities , @xmath82 . for unobscured agn",
    ", @xmath81 compares the emission power coming from the agn accretion disk ( at rest - frame 2500   ) relative to the emission power at rest - frame 2  kev , which is believed to originate from compton up - scattering of accretion disk photons by hot coronal gas of unknown geometry or disk - covering fraction .",
    "studies show that as 2500    accretion disk luminosity increases , the luminosity increases less dramatically at x - ray energies .",
    "the @xmath81 parameter thus probes the balance between accretion disks and their coronae , and provides a quantitative constraint on physical models of the structure and physics of agn nuclear regions .",
    "the scatter in @xmath81 is considerable , corresponding to a factor of @xmath83 range of x - ray luminosities observed for sources at a given uv luminosity . though some of this scatter is likely due to non - simultaneous observations at the two wavelengths ,",
    "studies show that most of the scatter is actually intrinsic @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath81 is not correlated with black hole mass , but is somewhat correlated with eddington ratio ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reports that there is no significant evolution of @xmath81 with redshift .",
    "we find a similar behavior here : as the mid - ir luminosity increases , the luminosity increases less dramatically at x - ray energies .",
    "agn mid - ir emission is generally believed to be primarily due to thermal radiation from a torus reprocessing accretion disk emission .",
    "previous results have shown that the mid - ir to bolometric luminosity of quasars , @xmath84 , decreases with increasing @xmath85 , an effect which is generally ascribed to the so - called receding torus model @xcite : if the scale height of the torus is independent of the radial size of the torus , but the inner radius of the torus increases with increasing agn luminosity , then the torus effectively covers a smaller solid angle for more luminous agn .",
    "thus , more luminous quasars are less likely to be seen as obscured , and will also have relatively diminished thermal ir emission from the obscuring torus . on the much smaller coronal scale ,",
    "we also see a trend of decreasing @xmath86 with increasing @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 reflects the competition of physics occurring on very different size scales , from the sub - parsec coronal scale , to the much larger obscuring torus scale , though a detailed investigation and modeling of this , accounting for various selection effects such as non - simultaneous x - ray and mid - ir imaging , is beyond the scope of the present work .    in summary",
    ", we have derived a new x - ray to mid - ir relation for agn which is appropriate for agn across a large range of luminosity , from local seyfert galaxies with @xmath67(2 - 10  kev ) @xmath88 out to the most powerful quasars known , with @xmath67(2 - 10  kev ) @xmath89 .",
    "previous explorations of this relation have generally emphasized either just local seyfert galaxies or just typical quasars , and no previous analyses have considered the most luminous quasars .",
    "the result is that extrapolations of the previous relations differ widely in certain regimes , particularly at the tip of the luminosity scale .",
    "the revised x - ray to mid - ir relation for agn will be beneficial for identifying and studying highly obscured agn , which will have their x - ray emission preferentially suppressed relative to their mid - ir emission .",
