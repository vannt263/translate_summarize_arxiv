    "the physics of the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model was the subject of intensive study for a number of years.@xcite more recently it has been realized that the bose - hubbard model can also be applied to bosons trapped in so - called optical lattices,@xcite and coarse graining@xcite , strong - coupling expansion,@xcite mean - field theories@xcite have been successfully applied to these systems in one-,@xcite two-@xcite and three - dimensional lattices.@xcite another essentially equivalent formulation is based on the gutzwiller wavefunction.@xcite also extension , based on a systematic strong - coupling approach of the bose - hubbard model beyond mean - field has been tried@xcite and experimentally confirmed.@xcite the progress comes from better computer resources and more efficient algorithm allows to use the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method for studies of the bh systems.@xcite    an optical lattices offer remarkably clean access to a particular hamiltonian and thereby serve as a model system for testing fundamental theoretical concepts and providing exemplar of quantum many - body effects.@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the ground state of a system of repulsively interacting bosons in a periodic potential can be either in a superfluid state ( sf ) or in a mott - insulting state ( mi ) , characterized by integer boson densities . because the phase of the order parameter and the particle number as conjugate variables are subject to the uncertainty principle @xmath1@xcite and the bosons can either be in the eigenstate of particle number or phase .",
    "the eigenstate of phase is a superfluid and that of particle number is a localized mott insulator .",
    "therefore the quantum mi - sf phase transition takes place as the particle density is shifted thus facilitating emergence of the superfluid from the mott insulating state .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the mean - field approach for the bose - hubbard model in a way to include particle number fluctuations effects and make the qualitative phase diagrams in two and three dimensions more quantitative .",
    "our method also improve the strong - coupling expansion that works well only for sufficiently large insulating gap.@xcite the key point of presented approach is to consider the representation of strongly interacting bosons as particles with attached  \" flux tubes  \" . in a consequence",
    "a boson is the composite object .",
    "this introduces a conjugate @xmath0 phase variable , which acquires dynamic significance from the boson - boson interaction . to facilitate this task",
    "we employ the functional integral formulation of the theory that enables us to perform the functional integration over fields defined on different topologically equivalent classes of the @xmath0 group , i.e. , with different winding numbers .",
    "an inclusion of the winding numbers is unavoidable in order to obtain a proper phase diagram .",
    "a similar method that is based on quantum rotor formulation was recently employed by one of us in the fermionic hubbard model.@xcite the nice feature of our approach is that all the expressions and handling are analytic .",
    "finally , we compare our results for systems at zero temperature with the outcome of the numerical simulations and found a very good agreement for the quantitative results regarding the behavior as we go from the superfluid phase to the mott insulating phase . in the framework of the introduced theory we are able to calculate the phase diagrams with high accuracy along whole critical line that separates mott insulator - superfluid phases .",
    "moreover , our approach gives a clear insight into the bose - hubbard model from a quantum field theory and emphasizes the impact of the topology of the phase variable on phase transitions .",
    "we show that the coulomb interaction ( as a main energy scale ) is governed the phase transitions in the bose - hubbard model .",

    "[ ntu ] that the competition between kinetic and interaction energy is the foundations of the quantum phase transitions in the bh model .",
    "increasing the value of the hopping term ( reducing the interaction energy ) leads to delocalization of the bosons thus the sharp steps of the mi state become indistinct and in consequence system is superfluid . in fig .",
    "[ ntu ] we observe the appearance of the mott - insulating lobes corresponding to curves from fig .",
    "the mi has a gap to density excitations and is an incompressible ( density plateaus in fig .",
    "[ ntu ] ) thus the chemical potential can be changed within a gap without changing the density . at the tip of the lobe at fixed integer density",
    "the transition is driven by the change of the @xmath121 ratio in a system composed of a fixed number of bosons .",
    "such a transition in a @xmath13-dimensional bh model lies in the universality class of the @xmath163-dimensional @xmath164 spin model .",
    "remain possibilities that the system can cross the superfluid - mott insulator phase boundary are called generic ( when we add / subtract a small number of particles ) and do not belong with the universality class of the @xmath164 spin model , so are characterized by different critical exponents .    the possibility to describe both",
    "the mott and sf phases in two dimensions can be also done using the strong - coupling expansion method.@xcite the obtained results are qualitatively comparable to our phase diagrams and show that both extensions of the bose - hubbard model beyond mean - field succeed in catching strongly interacting systems .",
    "besides , authors calculated the excitation energies and spectral weight and provided analytical formulas which expanded can be useful to determine the expected second order term in the momentum distribution.@xcite furthermore it seems that presented approaches can be in principle applied to more complicated situations .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the mott - insulator transition of the bose - hubbard model . to analyze a quantum phase transitions beyond mean - field theory we employed a @xmath0 quantum rotor approach and a path - integral formulation of quantum mechanics including a summation over a topological charge , explicitly tailored for the bh hamiltonian .",
    "the effective action formalism allows us to formulate a problem in the phase only action and obtain an analytical formulas for the critical lines .",
    "we have compared obtained results to existing numerical calculations and found them in a very good agreement .",
    "the formalism adopted here can be extended and applied to the other systems systematically .",
    "especially the effect of the competition between quantum effects in finite temperatures focuses our attention .",
    "considerations different geometries of the lattices are possible in the frame of our approach , as well . these topics will be considered in future publications .",
