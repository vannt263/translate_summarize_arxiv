    "the bose - hubbard model of lattice bosons with on - site interactions  @xcite is a widely used theoretical model for the description of a number of different physical systems , ranging from @xmath0he adsorbed in porous media  @xcite to granular superconductors  @xcite and josephson junction arrays  @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", the bose - hubbard model has attracted a renewed interest since its experimental realisation with ultracold atoms loaded in the periodic potential of an optical lattice @xcite . following the suggestion of @xcite ,",
    "this system has led to the observation of the superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transition @xcite and of quantum revivals of the matter field @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we propose a new tool for the study of the bose - hubbard model in the form of a quantum monte carlo scheme based on the stochastic evolution of a gutzwiller ansatz .",
    "this new scheme generalizes our previously proposed schemes based on a stochastic hartree ansatz  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that the hartree ansatz is not the optimal one for the study of a mott insulator state : the expansion of a mott - insulator state on hartree states involves an average over all the possible relative phases between adjacent sites , so that a large number of realizations is required for an accurate sampling of the state .",
    "furthermore , if one rises the on - site interaction strength to infinity so to realize the so - called impenetrable boson model , the rate of increase of the statistical error with time , being proportional to the strength of the atom - atom interactions , will diverge .    on the other hand , approximate analytical mean - field calculations based on a gutzwiller - type wavefunction have given predictions which are in reasonable agreement with the exact numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a suitable stochastic generalization of the gutzwiller mean - field equations could lead to an efficient quantum monte carlo scheme .",
    "the main difference with respect to the reformulation in terms of a stochastic hartree ansatz consists in the exchanged roles of the kinetic and the interaction energies : in the gutzwiller case , interactions can be fully taken into account by the deterministic evolution , while the noise is necessary to keep track of the correlations between different sites which are induced by the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "while the stochastic hartree reformulation was well suited for the study of weakly interacting bose gases  @xcite , the present gutzwiller scheme is expected to be more suited to the study of systems of strongly interacting bosons , such as the mott phase or the gas of impenetrable bosons .    in sec.[sec",
    ": gutz ] we review the bose - hubbard hamiltonian and we introduce the gutzwiller ansatz . in sec.[sec : timeevol ] we show how it is possible to find a suitable stochastic evolution of the gutzwiller wave function such that the stochastic evolution of the ansatz is equal , in the average , to the exact evolution given by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) . in sec.[sec : staterr ] we discuss the evolution of the statistical error of this stochastic reformulation of the many - body problem and , in particular , we show that the error remains finite at any time of the evolution .",
    "this guarantees that the stochastic gutzwiller reformulation can be actually used for numerical monte carlo calculations . in sec.[sec : imagtime ] , we extend the reformulation to the case of an imaginary - time evolution so as to obtain the thermal equilibrium state of the bose - hubbard system at a given temperature and chemical potential . a first application to the case of impenetrable bosons on a 1d lattice",
    "is presented , which shows the transition from a discrete tonks gas to the mott phase as the chemical potential is increased : the results are in good agreement with analytical calculations performed by means of fermionization techniques . for the sake of completeness , a brief discussion of these techniques is given in the appendix .",
    "in sec.[sec : spin ] we generalize the results to the case of several spin components .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec.[sec : conclu ] .",
    "in its simplest form , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath1 in which the spatial coordinate @xmath2 runs on a @xmath3-dimensional cubic lattice of @xmath4 points with periodic boundary conditions . with @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", we shall denote respectively the lattice spacing and the total lattice size along the @xmath7-th dimension .",
    "the on - site interaction is taken into account by the first term @xmath8 , which is proportional to the charging energy @xmath9 .",
    "the hopping from one site to a neighboring one is described by the other term @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 quantifies the amplitude of the hopping processes .",
    "the function @xmath12 is equal to one if @xmath2 and @xmath13 are neighboring sites , otherwise it vanishes .",
    "the annihilation operators @xmath14 satisfy the bosonic commutation rules @xmath15=\\delta _ { { { \\bf r } } , { { \\bf r}}'}$ ] .",
    "the generic gutzwiller ansatz can be written in terms of the complex wavefunctions @xmath16 as : @xmath17 this kind of states has been extensively used within mean - field theory to obtain approximate analytical results for strongly interacting bosons on a lattice : since the wave function has a factorized form , no correlations between different sites are included and the effect of @xmath10 can not be treated exactly .",
    "this is complementary to what happens in the case of a hartree ansatz where the mean field theory can deal exactly with the hopping hamiltonian , but not with the interaction one .",
    "the generality of the gutzwiller ansatz is however large enough to include glauber coherent states as well as fock states .",
    "a coherent state of macroscopic wavefunction @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , corresponds to a gutzwiller state with : @xmath21 on the other hand , a fock state in which each site has a well defined occupation @xmath22 corresponds to a gutzwiller wavefunction of the form : @xmath23 the gutzwiller ansatz is therefore much more flexible than the coherent state ansatz often used in quantum optics .",
    "its normalization is given by : @xmath24",
    "as the set of all gutzwiller states forms an overcomplete family , one can always assume that the initial state vector @xmath25 is a coherent superposition of gutzwiller states .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite for the case of a hartree ansatz , one can reabsorb the phases of the complex coefficients of this superposition by a redefinition of the gutzwiller wavefunctions , so that the initial state vector can be written as the average of the gutzwiller ansatz over some probability distribution for @xmath26 : @xmath27 where we represent this average by angular brackets @xmath28 . in the present section",
    ", we shall show that a suitable stochastic evolution can be found for the gutzwiller wavefunctions @xmath16 , such that a relation like ( [ eq : average0 ] ) holds at any time @xmath29 , in the sense that the exact state vector at time @xmath30 is given by the average over the ensemble of gutzwiller states resulting from all possible stochastic evolutions of the initial ensemble during the time @xmath30 : @xmath31    in the hopping hamiltonian @xmath10 , we first explicitely isolate the mean - field contribution by rewriting : @xmath32 { \\label{eq : h_j}}\\ ] ] in terms of the @xmath33-number mean - field @xmath34 .",
    "defined as : @xmath35 where the ket @xmath36 describes the state of the site @xmath2 : @xmath37 this corresponds to the general strategy , already implemented for the hartree - fock ansatz for bosons @xcite and for fermions @xcite , to have a deterministic evolution identical to the mean - field theory so that the stochastic part includes only deviations from mean - field .",
    "mathematically , as we shall see , this makes the noise term strictly orthogonal to the state @xmath38 , which is expected to minimize the growth rate of the statistical error .",
    "note that only the first term of the square bracket ( [ eq : h_j ] ) can induce correlations between different sites , and it is this term which will be taken into account with the noise term of the evolution .    the action of the total hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) on a gutzwiller state of the form ( [ eq : gutzwiller ] ) can then be written as : @xmath39\\ , \\big [ \\prod _ { { { \\bf u}}\\neq { { \\bf r } } }    \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\phi ( { { \\bf u}},n)\\frac{{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger } ( { { \\bf u}})^n}{\\sqrt{n ! } } \\big]\\ , { | 0 \\rangle } + \\\\+ \\frac{j\\,dt}{2i\\hbar}\\sum _ { { { \\bf r } } , { { \\bf r}}'}\\delta{^{(1 ) } } _ { { { \\bf r } } , { { \\bf r}}'}\\big[\\sum_{n , n'=0}^\\infty \\big(\\sqrt{n}\\,\\phi ( { { \\bf r}},n-1)-{\\bar \\psi}^ * ( { { \\bf r}})\\,\\phi ( { { \\bf r}},n)\\big ) \\big(\\sqrt{n'+1}\\,\\phi ( { { \\bf r}}',n'+1)-{\\bar \\psi } ( { { \\bf r}}')\\,\\phi ( { { \\bf r}}',n')\\big ) \\,\\frac{{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger } ( { { \\bf r}})^n\\,{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger } ( { { \\bf r}}')^{n'}}{\\sqrt{n!\\,n ' ! } } \\big]\\cdot \\\\ \\cdot\\big[\\prod _ { { { \\bf u}}\\neq { { \\bf r } } , { { \\bf r } } ' }     \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\phi ( { { \\bf u}},n)\\frac{{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger } ( { { \\bf u}})^n}{\\sqrt{n ! } } \\big]\\ , { | 0 \\rangle } , { \\label{eq : evol_h}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath40 have vanishing entries for @xmath41 , @xmath42,\\ ] ] @xmath43 and @xmath44 so to include all the on - site terms coming from both the interaction and the mean - field part of the hopping hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_j ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath45 appearing in the last term in ( [ eq : chi0 ] ) comes from the normalization ( [ eq : gutznormal ] ) of the gutzwiller state .",

    "it is easy to verify by direct substitution that a noise with the required correlation function ( [ eq : noisecorr ] ) can be obtained as : @xmath57 , { \\label{eq : mfs}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 being independent and zero - mean complex random variables such that : @xmath59 for the lattice here considered , the quasi - momentum @xmath60 is a @xmath61-component vector whose @xmath7th component is equal to @xmath62 , @xmath63 being an integer number @xmath64 .",

    "the error induced by imposing this cut - off is negligible provided a sufficiently large value of @xmath67 is adopted .",
    "as we have discussed in detail in  @xcite , formally imposing the correct value of the averages is not in general sufficient for a practical application : it is essential to prove the finiteness of the statistical error , which guarantees the convergence of the monte carlo simulation to the exact result in the limit of an infinite number of independent realizations .    as usual , the variance of the statistical error on the state vector of the system is defined in terms of the stochastically evolving gutzwiller ansatz @xmath68 and the exact state vector @xmath69 as : @xmath70    using the definition ( [ eq : average ] ) of the stochastic reformulation ,",
