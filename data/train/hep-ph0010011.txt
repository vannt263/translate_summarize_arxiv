    "strong final state interaction ( fsi ) effects are very important in the phenomenology of k meson decays . in the non  leptonic two",

    "wave @xmath5@xmath5 scattering generates a large phase shift difference @xmath6 between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 partial waves @xcite .",
    "this effect is taken into account by factoring out those phases in the usual decomposition of @xmath4 amplitudes with definite isospin @xmath7 and @xmath8 : [ eq : aidef ] a_i a a_i e^i^i_0 .",
    "the presence of such a large phase shift difference also signals a large dispersive fsi effect in the moduli of the isospin amplitudes , since their imaginary and real parts are related by analyticity and unitarity .",
    "intuitively , the behaviour of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 s  wave phase shifts as a function of the total energy of the two pions as reported in figure  [ fig : phaseshift ] suggests a large enhancement of the @xmath7 amplitude and a tiny suppression of the @xmath8 amplitude .    the numerical estimate of this dispersive fsi effect is a difficult task , since it is dominated by long  distance ( soft ) contributions and reduces to a non  perturbative problem .",
    "the size of the fsi effect can be roughly estimated at one loop in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , where the rescattering of the two pions in the final state produces an enhancement of about @xmath9 in the @xmath10 amplitude @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the one loop calculation still underestimates the observed @xmath11 phase shift indicates that a further enhancement should be produced by higher orders .",
    "it is then necessary to resum fsi effects .",
    "lattice determinations of @xmath4 amplitudes could in principle take into account _ automatically _ strong fsi effects .",
    "however , the direct measurement of @xmath4 amplitudes on the lattice is still afflicted by a series of problems .",
    "more recently , a possible solution to those problems which overcomes the maiani ",
    "testa theorem @xcite has been proposed @xcite . in the meanwhile ,",
    "most of the attempts up to date are based on the so called _ indirect _ method , i.e. a two  steps procedure where first the simpler @xmath12 matrix element is measured on the lattice and second , the physical @xmath1 matrix elements are obtained by using a lowest  order chpt relation between @xmath13 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "neither the first nor the second step include fsi effects .",
    "recently , the inclusion of one  loop chpt contributions has been investigated in this context @xcite .",
    "approaches based on effective low  energy models @xcite or the @xmath14 expansion @xcite do include some one - loop corrections and find larger values for the @xmath10 amplitude",
    ". however , the drawback in these cases might be the possible model dependence of the matching procedure with short  distance .    here",
    ", i discuss an approach to fsi effects in @xmath15 decays that has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "it is based on the omns solution @xcite for @xmath4 amplitudes , which permits the resummation of strong fsi effects to all orders in chpt . intuitively , what the omns solution does is to correct a local weak @xmath4 transition with an infinite chain of pion  loop bubbles , incorporating the strong @xmath16 rescattering to all orders in chpt .",
    "a few properties of strong fsi effects can be useful in order to understand how they enter the prediction of @xmath15 decays :    * the production of the two pions and their subsequent rescattering are two independent processes .",
    "the rescattering process only depends on the quantum numbers ( total isospin @xmath17 and total angular momentum @xmath18 ) of the two pions in the final state and on their total energy .",
    "* at centre  of  mass energies of the order of the k meson mass the elastic ( soft ) rescattering of the two pions is the dominant strong fsi effect .",
    "hence , strong fsi effects in @xmath15 amplitudes can be treated in a fully non  perturbative way .",
    "this implies that in the usual description of weak @xmath19 decays with operator product expansion ( ope ) , strong fsi effects can be treated without introducing any dependence on the factorization scale which separates short  distance and long  distance contributions .",
    "the last point means that the strong fsi problem in @xmath15 decays can be solved independently of the matching problem between short  distance wilson coefficients and long  distance weak matrix elements .",
    "the situation can be different for higher energy processes like rare @xmath20 decays such as @xmath21 , where , at the b meson mass , hard rescattering and soft inelastic rescattering contributions are expected to be the dominant strong fsi effects .    in section  [ omnes ] the general omns problem",
    "is formulated , while in section  [ kaon ] i review the omns solution for the @xmath4 amplitudes @xcite , mainly in the cp conserving sector .",
    "a few results for the cp violating amplitudes , relevant for the prediction of @xmath22 are also discussed .",
    "a new standard model prediction of @xmath22 with the inclusion of fsi effects is discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a generic amplitude ( or form factor ) @xmath23 , with two pions in the final state which have total angular momentum and isospin given by @xmath18 and @xmath17 , respectively , and invariant mass @xmath24 .",
    "the amplitude is analytic everywhere except for a cut on the real positive @xmath25 axis @xmath26 .",
    "below the first inelastic threshold , only the @xmath27 intermediate state contributes to the absorptive part of the amplitude and watson s theorem @xcite implies that the phase of the amplitude is equal to the phase of the @xmath28 partial  wave scattering amplitude , so that [ eq : wasim_el ] & & a^i_j = ( a^i_j ) _ 2 = e^-i^i_j a^i_j = + & & e^i^i_j a^i_j = a^i_j = a^i_j .",
    "cauchy s theorem implies instead that @xmath23 can be written as a dispersive integral along the physical cut : [ eq : disp ] a^i_j(s ) = 1_l   d z + . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : wasim_el ] ) in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) , one obtains an integral equation for @xmath23 of the omns type , which has the well  known omns solution @xcite ( for @xmath29 subtractions with subtraction point @xmath30 outside the physical cut ) : [ eq : nsub ] a^i_j(s ) = q^i_j , n(s , s_0 )   , where [ eq : in ] & & i^i_j , n(s , s_0 ) + & & ^_4m^2 _ dz(z - s_0)^n ^i_j(z ) z - s - i and [ eq : nsub_q ] & & + & & _ k=0^n-1 ( s - s_0)^k k ! .",
    "|_s = s_0 , for @xmath31 and with @xmath32 .",
    "the dispersive integral @xmath33 is uniquely determined up to a polynomial ambiguity ( that does not produce any imaginary part of the amplitude ) , which depends on the number of subtractions and the subtraction point .",
    "the simple iterative relation for the real part of @xmath33 [ eq : iter ] & & i^i_j , n(s , s_0 ) = i^i_j , n-1 ( s , s_0 ) + & & - ( s - s_0)^n-1_ss_0 i^i_j , n-1(s , s_0 ) ( s - s_0)^n-1 , shows that only a polynomial part of @xmath33 does depend on the subtraction point @xmath30 and the number of subtractions @xmath29 , while the non  polynomial part of @xmath33 , the one containing the infrared chiral logarithms , is universal ( i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath29 independent ) .",
    "thus , the omns solution predicts the chiral logarithmic corrections in a universal way and provides their exponentiation to all orders in the chiral expansion . the polynomial ambiguity of @xmath33 and the subtraction function @xmath34 can be fixed , at a given order in the chiral expansion , by matching the omns formula ( [ eq : nsub ] ) with the chpt prediction of @xmath23 .",
    "it remains a polynomial ambiguity at higher orders .",
    "notice that in the presence of a zero of the amplitude the omns solution can be found for the factorized amplitude @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a zero of order @xmath38 .",

    "those infrared logarithms are universal , i.e. only depend on the quantum numbers of the @xmath28 system in the final state . *",
    "the omns solution provides an evolution of the given amplitude from low energy values , where the chpt momentum expansion can be trusted , to higher energy values , through the exponentiation of the infrared effects due to fsi .    however , one difference between the omns solution for @xmath15 amplitudes and the scalar pion form factor , is that we need to consider an off - shell kaon of mass squared @xmath55 in the first case , instead of a physical momentum transfer @xmath25 .",
    "this generates a _ local _ ambiguity at higher orders in the chpt expansion ( see also @xcite for the explicit expressions at the next  to  leading order in chpt ) , which however has nothing to do with the omns procedure of resumming fsi effects .",

    "since there is a single strong phase , for a given isospin , the unitarity relation ( [ eq : wasim_el ] ) is valid for @xmath64 and @xmath63 individually and the omns problem can be solved separately for the two pieces . combining them ,",
    "one can write the result for the physical on - shell amplitude in the simpler form : [ eq : omnes_wa ] & & _ i _ i(m_k^2 ) = ( m_k^2-m_^2 ) a_i(m_k^2 ) + & & = ( m_k^2-m_^2 ) _",

    "( [ eq : nsub ] ) and can be split into the dispersive contribution @xmath68 and the phase shift exponential .",
    "notice also that the once  subtracted omns factor @xmath69 is universal because it only depends on the phase shifts @xmath70 , while for two subtractions the omns factor depends on @xmath71 for a given amplitude @xmath72 .",
    "however , given the smallness of the sub - leading @xmath73 contribution , it remains a good numerical approximation to take a global omns factor for @xmath74 also with two subtractions .    for each of the amplitudes @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( the octet and 27-plet @xmath7 amplitudes ) and @xmath77 ( with @xmath8 ) , the @xmath25 dependence can be written in a simple form : [ eq : s_dep ] a(s ) = a(0)\\ { 1 + g(s ) + o(p^4 ) } , where the one  loop functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 have been computed in ref .",
    "the main properties of the @xmath81 functions can be summarized as follows :    * the contribution from @xmath82 is always very small and exclusively due to non ",

    "all isoscalar @xmath85 functions contain exactly the same infrared @xmath86 contribution and the same contribution from the finite one  loop @xmath28 rescattering function @xmath87 @xcite which generates the absorptive part of the isospin amplitude below the inelastic threshold .",
    "this shows the universality of the infrared effects due to fsi . * the @xmath25 dependence of the one  loop correction at low values of @xmath25",
    "is dominated by the pure @xmath88 effect of elastic @xmath16 scattering .",

    "independent analysis still remains affected by the ambiguity due to the presence of _ local _ contributions , already for the on  shell amplitude .",
    "the omns factor can not fix that problem .",
    "the role of the omns factor remains that of providing an efficient resummation of large infrared effects due to fsi .",
    "the advantage of the omns exponentiation respect to the usual one  loop chpt computation is to control the uncertainty coming from higher order ( @xmath90 two  loops ) fsi effects .    taking a low subtraction point @xmath91 where higher  order corrections",

    "level formulae ( [ tree ] ) with the experimentally determined omns exponentials @xcite .",
    "the two dispersive corrections factors thus obtained @xcite are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where the errors are supposed to take into account a ) the uncertainties of the fits to the experimental phase shifts data used in the calculation of the omns factor and b ) the additional inelastic contributions above the first inelastic threshold .",
