    "the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem @xcite-@xcite , the accelerated expansion of the late time universe@xcite , the cosmic coincidence @xcite are challenges for the foundations of modern physics ( see also reviews on dark energy@xcite-@xcite , dark matter @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerous models have been proposed with the aim to find answer to these puzzles , for example : the quintessence@xcite , coupled quintessence@xcite , @xmath3-essence@xcite , variable mass particles@xcite , interacting quintessence@xcite , chaplygin gas@xcite , phantom field@xcite , tachyon matter cosmology@xcite , brane world scenarios@xcite , etc .. these puzzles have also motivated an interest in modifications and even radical revisions of the standard gravitational theory ( general relativity ( gr))@xcite,@xcite . although motivations for most of these models can be found in fundamental theories like for example in brane world@xcite , the questions concerning the einstein gr limit and relation to the regular particle physics , like standard model , still remain unclear .",
    "it is very hard to imagine that it is possible to propose ideas which are able to solve the above mentioned problems keeping at the same time unchanged the basis of fundamental physics , i.e. gravity and particle field theory .",
    "this paper may be regarded as _ an attempt to find a way for satisfactory answers at least to a part of the fundamental questions on the basis of first principles _ ,",
    "i.e. without using semi - empirical models . in this paper",
    "we explore a toy model including gravity and a single scalar field @xmath0 in the framework of the so called two measures field theory ( tmt)@xcite-@xcite . in tmt , gravity ( or more exactly , geometry ) and particle field theory intertwined in a very non trivial manner , but the einstein s gr is restored when the fermion matter energy density is much larger than the vacuum energy density@xcite,@xcite .    here",
    "we _ have no purpose _ of constructing a complete realistic cosmological scenario .",
    "instead , we concentrate our attention on the possible role tmt may play in resolution of a number of the above mentioned problems . the field theory model we will study here",
    "is invariant under global scale transformation of the metric accompanied with an appropriate shift of the dilaton field @xmath0 .",
    "this scale symmetry is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the tmt dynamics . except for a peculiar structure of the tmt action",
    ", the latter does not contain any exotic terms .",
    "the obtained dynamics represents an explicit example of @xmath3-essence resulting from first principles .",
    "the parameter space of the model allows to find different regions where the following different effects can take place _ without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions _ :",
    "\\a ) possibility of a power law inflation driven by a scalar field @xmath0 which is followed by the late time evolution driven both by a small cosmological constant and a scalar field @xmath0 with a quintessence - like potential ; smallness of the cosmological constant can be achieved _ without fine tuning of dimensionfull parameters_.    \\b ) in another region of the parameters , there is a possibility of the power law inflation ended with damped oscillations of @xmath0 around the state with zero cosmological constant ( we want to emphasize again that this is realized without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions ) .",
    "thus this scenario includes _ an exit from inflation together with resolution of the old cc problem_. this becomes possible because the basic assumptions of the weinberg s no - go theorem@xcite are generically violated in tmt models .",
    "\\c ) there is a region of the parameters where the model exhibits the possibility for a superacceleration phase of the universe : in the late time universe the dark energy density @xmath9 increases asymptotically ( as @xmath7 ) approaching from below to a constant value ; the equation - of - state @xmath10 and @xmath6 _ asymptotically approaches _ @xmath8 _ from below_.    the organization of the paper is the following : in sec.ii we present a review of the basic ideas of tmt .",
    "sec.iii starts from formulation of a simple scale invariant model containing all the terms respecting the symmetry of the model but without any exotic terms . in appendix",
    "a we present equations of motion in the original frame . using results of appendix a , the complete set of equations of motion in the einstein frame is given in sec.iii as well .",
    "it is shown there that if no fine tuning of the parameters is made , the effective action of our model in the einstein frame turns out to be a k - essence type action .",
    "we start in sec.iv from a simple case with fine tuned parameters where the non - linear dependence of the kinetic term disappears",
    ". then three different shapes of the effective potential are possible .",
    "for the spatially flat frw universe we study some features of the cosmological dynamics for each of the shapes of the effective potential . for one of the shapes of the effective potential ,",
    "the zero vacuum energy is achieved without any fine tuning . in sec.v",
    "we study the cosmological dynamics without tuning parameters . it is shown that there is the possibility of a superacceleration phase of the universe , and some details of the dynamics are explored .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to studying in more details the cc problems : a ) we discuss two mechanisms for resolution of the new cc problem ; b ) we analyze the difference between tmt and conventional field theories ( where only the measure of integration @xmath4 is used in the fundamental action ) which allows to understand why from the point of view of tmt the conventional field theories failed to solve the old cc problem . in appendix",
    "b we shortly discuss what kind of model one would obtain when choosing fine tuned couplings to the measures of integration in the action . some additional remarks concerning the relation between the structure of tmt action and the cc problem are given in appendix c.",
    "tmt is a generally coordinate invariant theory where _ all the difference from the standard field theory in curved space - time consists only of the following three additional assumptions _ :",
    "the main supposition is that for describing the effective action for gravity @xmath11 matter at energies below the planck scale , the usual form of the action @xmath12 is not complete .",
    "our positive hypothesis is that the effective action has to be of the form@xcite-@xcite @xmath13 including two lagrangians @xmath14 and @xmath15 and two measures of integration @xmath4 and @xmath16 or , equivalently , two volume elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "one is the usual measure of integration @xmath4 in the 4-dimensional space - time manifold equipped with the metric @xmath19 .",
    "another is the new measure of integration @xmath16 in the same 4-dimensional space - time manifold .",
    "the measure @xmath16 being a scalar density and a total derivative in string and brane theories see ref.@xcite . ] may be defined    * either by means of four scalar fields @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , ( compare with the approach by wilczek ) , @xmath22 * or by means of a totally antisymmetric three index field @xmath23 @xmath24    to provide parity conservation in the case given by eq.([phi ] ) one can choose for example one of @xmath20 s to be a pseudoscalar ; in the case given by eq.([aabg ] ) we must choose @xmath23 to have negative parity .",
    "some ideas concerning the nature of the measure fields @xmath20 are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a special case of the structure ( [ s ] ) with definition ( [ aabg ] ) has been recently discussed in ref.@xcite in applications to supersymmetric theory and the cc problem .",
    "it is assumed that the lagrangian densities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are functions of all matter fields , the dilaton field , the metric , the connection but not of the `` measure fields '' ( @xmath20 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "in such a case , i.e. when the measure fields enter in the theory only via the measure @xmath16 , the action ( [ s ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry . in the case given by eq.([phi ] ) these symmetry transformations have the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are arbitrary functions of @xmath27 ( see details in ref.@xcite ) ; in the case given by eq.([aabg ] ) they read @xmath28 where @xmath29 are four arbitrary functions of @xmath27 and @xmath30 is numerically the same as @xmath31",
    ". one can hope that this symmetry should prevent emergence of a measure fields dependence in @xmath14 and @xmath15 after quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "important feature of tmt that is responsible for many interesting and desirable results of the field theory models studied so far@xcite-@xcite consists of the assumption that all fields , including also metric , connection and the _ measure fields _ ( @xmath20 or @xmath23 ) are independent dynamical variables .",
    "all the relations between them are results of equations of motion .",
    "in particular , the independence of the metric and the connection means that we proceed in the first order formalism and the relation between connection and metric is not necessarily according to riemannian geometry .",
    "we want to stress again that except for the listed three assumptions we do not make any changes as compared with principles of the standard field theory in curved space - time . in other words , all the freedom in constructing different models in the framework of tmt consists of the choice of the concrete matter content and the lagrangians @xmath14 and @xmath15 that is quite similar to the standard field theory .",
    "since @xmath16 is a total derivative , a shift of @xmath27 by a constant , @xmath32 , has no effect on the equations of motion .",
    "similar shift of @xmath15 would lead to the change of the constant part of the lagrangian coupled to the volume element @xmath33 . in the standard",
    "gr , this constant term is the cosmological constant . however in tmt the relation between the constant term of @xmath15 and the physical cosmological constant is very non trivial ( see @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite ) .    in the case of the definition of @xmath16 by means of eq.([phi ] ) , varying the measure fields @xmath20 , we get @xmath34 since @xmath35 it follows that if @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a constant of integration with the dimension of mass . in what follows we make the choice @xmath40 .    in the case of the definition ( [ aabg ] ) , variation of @xmath23 yields @xmath41 that implies eq.([varphi ] ) without the condition @xmath36 needed in the model with four scalar fields @xmath20 .",
    "one should notice _ the very important differences of tmt from scalar - tensor theories with nonminimal coupling _ : + a ) in general , the lagrangian density @xmath27 ( coupled to the measure @xmath16 ) may contain not only the scalar curvature term ( or more general gravity term ) but also all possible matter fields terms .",
    "this means that tmt modifies in general both the gravitational sector and the matter sector ; b ) if the field @xmath16 were the fundamental ( non composite ) one then instead of ( [ varphi ] ) , the variation of @xmath16 would result in the equation @xmath42 and therefore the dimensionfull integration constant @xmath43 would not appear in the theory .",
    "applying the palatini formalism in tmt one can show ( see for example @xcite and appendix a of the present paper ) that in addition to the christoffel s connection coefficients , the resulting relation between connection and metric includes also the gradient of the ratio of the two measures @xmath44 which is a scalar field .",
    "consequently geometry of the space - time with the metric @xmath19 is non - riemannian .",
    "the gravity and matter field equations obtained by means of the first order formalism contain both @xmath45 and its gradient as well .",
    "it turns out that at least at the classical level , the measure fields affect the theory only through the scalar field @xmath45 .",
    "the consistency condition of equations of motion has the form of a constraint which determines @xmath46 as a function of matter fields .",
    "the surprising feature of the theory is that neither newton constant nor curvature appear in this constraint which means that the _ geometrical scalar field _",
    "@xmath46 _ is determined by the matter fields configuration _ locally and straightforward ( that is without gravitational interaction ) .    by an appropriate change of the dynamical variables which includes a conformal transformation of the metric",
    ", one can formulate the theory in a riemannian space - time .",
    "the corresponding conformal frame we call `` the einstein frame '' .",
    "the big advantage of tmt is that in the very wide class of models , _ the gravity and all matter fields equations of motion take canonical gr form in the einstein frame_. all the novelty of tmt in the einstein frame as compared with the standard gr is revealed only in an unusual structure of the scalar fields effective potential ( produced in the einstein frame ) , masses of fermions and their interactions with scalar fields as well as in the unusual structure of fermion contributions to the energy - momentum tensor : all these quantities appear to be @xmath45 dependent@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is why the scalar field @xmath46 determined by the constraint as a function of matter fields , has a key role in dynamics of tmt models .",
    "the tmt models possessing a global scale invariance@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite are of significant interest because they demonstrate the possibility of spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry .",
    "in fact , if the action ( [ s ] ) is scale invariant then this classical field theory effect results from eq.([varphi ] ) , namely from solving the equation of motion ( [ varphib ] ) or ( [ adl1 ] ) . one of the interesting applications of the scale invariant tmt models@xcite is a possibility to generate the exponential potential for the scalar field @xmath0 by means of the mentioned spontaneous symmetry breaking even without introducing any potentials for @xmath0 in the lagrangians @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the action ( [ s ] ) . some cosmological applications of this effect have been also studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "a dilaton field @xmath0 allows to realize a spontaneously broken global scale invariance@xcite and together with this it governs the evolution of the universe on different stages : in the early universe @xmath0 plays the role of inflaton and in the late time universe it is transformed into a part of the dark energy .",
    "according to the general prescriptions of tmt , we have to start from studying the self - consistent system of gravity ( metric @xmath19 and connection @xmath47 ) , the measure @xmath16 degrees of freedom ( i.e. measure fields @xmath48 or @xmath23 ) and the dilaton field @xmath0 proceeding in the first order formalism .",
    "we postulate that the theory is invariant under the global scale transformations : @xmath49 if the definition ( [ aabg ] ) is used for the measure @xmath16 then the transformations of @xmath20 in ( [ st ] ) should be changed by @xmath50 .",
    "this global scale invariance includes the shift symmetry of the dilaton @xmath0 and this is the main factor why it is important for cosmological applications of the theory@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we choose an action which , except for the modification of the general structure caused by the basic assumptions of tmt , _ does not contain any exotic terms and fields _ as like in the conventional formulation of the minimally coupled scalar - gravity system . keeping the general structure ( [ s ] ) , it is convenient to represent the action in the following form : @xmath51   \\label{totaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the action ( [ totaction ] ) there are two types of the gravitational terms and of the `` kinetic - like terms '' which respect the scale invariance : the terms of the one type coupled to the measure @xmath16 and those of the other type coupled to the measure @xmath4 .",
    "using the freedom in normalization of the measure fields ( @xmath20 in the case of using eq.([phi ] ) or @xmath23 when using eq.([aabg ] ) ) , we set the coupling constant of the scalar curvature to the measure @xmath16 to be @xmath52 .",
    "normalizing all the fields such that their couplings to the measure @xmath16 have no additional factors , we are not able in general to provide the same in terms describing the appropriate couplings to the measure @xmath4 . this fact explains the need to introduce the dimensionless real parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 and we will only assume that _ they have close orders of magnitudes_. note that in the case of the choice @xmath55 we would proceed with _ the fine tuned model_. the real positive parameter @xmath56 is assumed to be of the order of unity ; in all solutions presented in this paper we set @xmath57 . for newton",
    "constant we use @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "one should also point out the possibility of introducing two different pre - potentials which are exponential functions of the dilaton @xmath0 coupled to the measures @xmath16 and @xmath4 with factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "such @xmath0-dependence provides the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) .",
    "however @xmath60 and @xmath61 might be higgs - dependent and then they play the role of the higgs pre - potentials , but this will be done in the future publication .      in appendix",
    "a we present the equations of motion resulting from the action ( [ totaction ] ) when using the original set of variables .",
    "the common feature of all the equations in the original frame is that the measure @xmath16 degrees of freedom appear only through dependence upon the scalar field @xmath45 , eq.([zeta ] ) . in particular , all the equations of motion and the solution for the connection coefficients include terms proportional to @xmath62 , that makes space - time non riemannian and all equations of motion - noncanonical .",
    "it turns out that when working with the new metric ( @xmath0 remains the same ) @xmath63 which we call the einstein frame , the connection becomes riemannian .",
    "since @xmath64 is invariant under the scale transformations ( [ st ] ) , spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry ( by means of eq.([varphi ] ) which for our model ( [ totaction ] ) takes the form ( [ app1 ] ) ) is reduced in the einstein frame to the _ spontaneous breakdown of the shift symmetry _ @xmath65    notice that the goldstone theorem generically is not applicable in this model@xcite .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "in fact , the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) leads to a conserved dilatation current @xmath66 .",
    "however , for example in the spatially flat frw universe the spatial components of the current @xmath67 behave as @xmath68 as @xmath69 . due to this anomalous behavior at infinity",
    ", there is a flux of the current leaking to infinity , which causes the non conservation of the dilatation charge .",
    "the absence of the latter implies that one of the conditions necessary for the goldstone theorem is missing .",
    "the non conservation of the dilatation charge is similar to the well known effect of instantons in qcd where singular behavior in the spatial infinity leads to the absence of the goldstone boson associated to the @xmath70 symmetry .",
    "after the change of variables to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) and some simple algebra , eq.([app4 ] ) takes the standard gr form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the einstein tensor in the riemannian space - time with the metric @xmath64 ; the energy - momentum tensor @xmath73 is now @xmath74 where the function @xmath75 is defined as following : @xmath76 -v_{2}}{(\\zeta + b_{g})^{2}}. \\label{veff1}\\ ] ] putting @xmath39 in the arguments of @xmath77 we indicate explicitly that @xmath77 incorporates our choice for the integration constant @xmath39 that appears as a result of the spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry .",
    "we will see in the next sections that @xmath45-dependence of @xmath78 in the form of _ square _ of @xmath79 has a key role in the resolution of the old cc problem in tmt .",
    "the reason that only such @xmath45-dependence emerges in @xmath78 , and a @xmath45-dependence is absent for example in the numerator of @xmath78 , is a direct result of our basic assumption that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are independent of the measure fields ( see item 2 in sec.ii ) .",

    "if such the ratio between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is actually realized , then taking into account the fact that @xmath80 and @xmath81 describe the same matter and gravity degrees of freedom in a very similar manner , the question arises why @xmath80 is not dynamically negligible in comparison with @xmath81 . to answer this question we have to turn to the fundamental action ( [ totaction ] ) that it is convenient to rewrite in the following form @xmath265   \\label{totaction1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one can see that the ratio @xmath266 has an important dynamical role . analyzing the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) and cosmological dynamics studied in secs.iv and v it is easy to see that the order of magnitude of the scalar field @xmath267 is generically close to that of @xmath53 . in other words ,",

    "now we want to analyze some of the essential differences we have in tmt as compared with the conditions of the weinberg s no - go theorem and show what are the reasons providing solution of the old cc problem in tmt .",

    "the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) enables to see the physical meaning of tmt because the space - time becomes riemannian in the einstein frame .",
    "now we see that the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) plays also the role of a * regularization of the space - time metric * : the singular behavior of the transformation ( [ ct ] ) as @xmath322 compensates the disappearance of the original metric @xmath19 in the vacuum @xmath133 . as a result of this the metric in the einstein frame @xmath64 turns out to be well defined in all physical states including the @xmath314 vacuum state .",
    "the main idea of tmt is that the general form of the action @xmath323 is not enough in order to account for some of the fundamental problems of particle physics and cosmology .",

    "\\2 ) _ the new cosmological constant problem_. interesting result following from the general structure of the scale invariant tmt model with @xmath161 is that the cosmological constant @xmath163 , eq.([lambda ] ) , is a ratio of quantities constructed from pre - potentials @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath97 .",
    "such structure of @xmath163 allows to propose two ways ( see sec.vi ) for resolution of the problem of the smallness of @xmath163 that should be @xmath242 :    \\a ) the first way is a kind of a _ seesaw _ mechanism@xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath245 and @xmath246 then @xmath253 .",

    "if no fine tuning of the parameters is made in the fundamental action , namely if @xmath332 , then our tmt model has big enough regions in the parameter space where the super - acceleration phase in the late time universe becomes possible .",
    "the appropriate phantom dark energy asymptotically approaches a cosmological constant .",
    "however it is impossible to obtain _ a pure classical solution _ which connects the early universe power law inflation with the late time super - acceleration .",
    "this problem is apparently related with the toy character of the scenario where the role of the matter creation has been ignored : in tmt the fermionic matter generically contributes to the constraint equation for the scalar field @xmath45 and so can effect the field @xmath0 dynamics as well .      in this paper we have studied only classical tmt and its possible effects in the context of cosmology",
    ". however quantization of tmt as well as influence of quantum effects on the processes explored in this paper may have a crucial role .",
    "we summarize here some ideas and speculations which gives us a hope that quantum effects can keep the main results of this paper .",
    "recall first two fundamental facts of tmt as a classical field theory : ( a ) the measure degrees of freedom appear in the equations of motion only via the scalar @xmath45 , eq.([zeta ] ) ; ( b ) the scalar @xmath45 is determined ( as a function of matter fields , in our toy model - as a function of @xmath0 ) by the constraint which is nothing but a consistency condition of the equations of motion ( see eqs.([app1])-([app3 ] ) in appendix a and eq.([constraint2 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore the constraint plays a key role in tmt .",
    "note however that if we were ignore the gravity from the very beginning in the action ( [ totaction ] ) then instead of the constraint ( [ app3 ] ) we would obtain eq.([app1 ] ) ( where one has to put zero the scalar curvature ) .",
    "in such a case we would deal with a different theory .",
    "this notion shows that the gravity and matter intertwined in tmt in a much more complicated manner than in gr . hence introducing the new measure of integration @xmath16 we have to expect that the quantization of tmt may be a complicated enough problem .",
    "nevertheless we would like here to point out that in the light of the recently proposed idea of ref.@xcite , the incorporation of four scalar fields @xmath48 together with the scalar density @xmath16 , eq.([phi ] ) , ( which in our case are the measure fields and the new measure of integration respectively ) , is a possible way to define local observables in the local quantum field theory approach to quantum gravity .",
    "we regard this result as an indication that the effective gravity @xmath11 matter field theory has to contain the new measure of integration @xmath16 as it is in tmt .",
    "the assumption formulated in item 2 in sec.iia , that the measure fields @xmath48 ( or @xmath23 ) appear in the action ( [ s ] ) _ only _ via the measure of integration @xmath16 , has a key role in the tmt results and in particular for the resolution of the old cosmological constant problem . in principle",
    "one can think of breakdown of such a structure by quantum corrections .",
    "however , tmt possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry mentioned in item 2 of sec.ii which , as we hope , is able to protect the postulated structure of the action from a deformation caused by quantum corrections .",
    "another effect of quantum corrections is the possible appearance of a nonminimal coupling of the dilaton field @xmath0 to gravity in the form like for example @xmath333 .",
    "proceeding in the first order formalism of tmt one can show that the nonminimal coupling can affect the k - essence dynamics but the mechanism for resolution of the old cc problem exhibited in this paper remains unchanged .",
    "this conclusion together with expected effect of quantum corrections on the scale invariance ( see our discussion in the paragraph after eq.([veff=0 ] ) ) allows us to hope that the exhibited resolution of the old cc problem holds in the quantized tmt as well .",
    "quantization of tmt being a constrained system requires developing the hamiltonian formulation of tmt .",
    "preliminary consideration shows that the einstein frame appears in the canonical formalism in a very natural manner .",
