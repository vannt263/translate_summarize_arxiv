    "over the past two decades there has been a renewed interest in measuring fundamental dimensionless constants such as the proton to electron mass ratio @xmath0 and the fine structure constant @xmath1 in the early universe .",
    "modulo some possibilities discussed at this conference , impressive constraints on the variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been established over time periods that span a significant fraction of the age of the universe . here",
    "the implications of those constraints are examined in terms of the stability of three basic physics parameters , the quantum chromodynamic scale @xmath2 , the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath3 and the yukawa couplings @xmath4 .",
    "previous reports of a possible variation of @xmath1 @xcite spurred significant efforts to account for the variation in terms of varying @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these efforts form the basis of the present work except that the process is reversed in that constraints on the variability of the physics parameters is established in terms of the limits on the variability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "most of the earlier efforts limited the variabililty to only one of the physics parameters , usually @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast the work of @xcite considered the possibility of all three parameters varying . as",
    "such it is the primary reference in this work .",
    "there are relatively few constraints on the variation of @xmath0 since molecular spectra provide the primary limits on the variability of @xmath0 @xcite and only a few molecular spectra at high redshift exist . on the other hand radio observations of molecular spectra at moderate redshifts provide a significantly tighter constraint on @xmath0 than exists for @xmath1 .",
    "the current limits on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given below .",
    "the constraints on @xmath5 come from optical observations of redshifted electronic transitions of molecular hydrogen and from radio observations of methanol and ammonia molecules .",
    "the majority of the h@xmath6 observations are at redshifts greater than two where the ultraviolet rest frame transitions enter the optical bands and the current radio observations are all at redshifts less than one .",
    "the radio observations , however , are significantly more accurate than the optical h@xmath6 observations .",
    "the radio observations of methanol in pks1830 - 211 @xcite @xmath7 at a redshift of 0.88582 is currently the tightest constraint on a variation of @xmath0 . in spite of the relatively low redshift",
    "the look back time is greater than half the age of the universe .",

    "( see the contributions by webb et al . in these proceedings ) .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite , however , sees no variation at the @xmath16 at the @xmath8 level where the error is the rms of the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "this is a significantly lower constraint than the reported variation by @xcite of @xmath17 and consistent with no change in @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite attributes the difference to known wavelength calibration errors in the previous analysis in @xcite and @xcite . for the purposes of this work the limits on a variation of @xmath1 discussed in @xcite",
    "is taken as the primary limit .",
    "the numerical values of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 depend on the values of the physics parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the following follows the discussion of @xcite done for a different purpose but relevant to the current analysis .",
    "the connection between the fundamental constants and the physics parameters is probably most obvious for the proton to electron mass ratio @xmath0 where the physics parameters set the mass of the proton and electron .",
    "the fractional change of @xmath0 , @xmath18 by simple mathematics is @xmath19 the fractional change of the electron mass is easy since it is a fundamental particle whose mass is set by the higgs vev and the electron yukawa coupling such that @xmath20 therefore @xmath21 the mass of the proton , however , is much more complicated since it is a composite particle but the fractional change is easier since the ratio eliminates some of the terms . in @xcite",
    "the fractional change of the proton mass is given by @xmath22 both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are scalars of order unity whose sum by dimensional requirements should equal one to ensure that the proton has units of mass . combining ( [ eq - dme ] ) and",
    "( [ eq - dmp ] ) gives @xmath25 here the common assumption that although the yukawa couplings have different values their fractional changes @xmath26 should be the same is employed .",

    "a new model dependent parameter @xmath31 is introduced that can range between unity and in excess of 100 . in @xcite @xmath31",

    "for the purposes of this work that value is accepted partially since it is in the midrange of currently acceptable values .",
    "both ( [ eq - qhy ] ) and ( [ eq - dal ] ) effectively depend on two variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 which provides a mechanism for solving for @xmath32 as a function of the constraints on the variance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the model dependent parameters .",
    "various authors use different models and assumptions to set the value of @xmath31 .",
    "an example is @xcite who assumes that the variation in @xmath1 is produced by temporal changes of the gut unification scale @xmath34 which also makes the physics parameters time variable . in this model",
    "@xmath31 is given by @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are the beta function coefficients that scale @xmath37 .",
    "at the unification scale @xmath34 all of the beta functions are unified to @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "the different gauge couplings @xmath41 @xmath42 are then given by @xmath43 the gut scale @xmath34 is allowed to change but @xmath44 and @xmath45 are held constant where @xmath45 is the planck mass . at the unification scale @xmath31 is given by @xmath46 as @xmath38 becomes either positively or negatively large the value of @xmath31 approaches 36 , the value used in @xcite .",
    "the combination of constraints on the fractional variation of two fundamental constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 provides the opportunity to put constraints on the fractional variation of @xmath2 . eliminating @xmath33 from  [ eq - qhy ] and  [ eq - dal ] yields @xmath47 } + \\frac{d \\mu}{\\mu}\\frac{2}{9[(b-1)-\\frac{2}{9}a]}\\ ] ] where both factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 from ( [ eq - dmp ] ) have been retained . in @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49 . again invoking @xmath27 ( [ eq - dqcdn ] ) simplifies to @xmath50 eliminating @xmath32 provides a constraint on @xmath33 of @xmath51.\\ ] ] note that the leading terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq - dqcdab ] ) and ( [ eq - hvlim ] ) are identical .      at the expense of additional model dependence it is possible to individually constrain @xmath54 and @xmath26 . in the standard model",
    "there is an established relationship between the fractional variation of the higgs vev @xmath3 and the fractional variation of the yukawa couplings @xmath4 given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 the value of @xmath56 is model dependent so the constraints on @xmath54 and @xmath26 are doubly model dependent .",
    "these constraints come from using ( [ eq - s ] ) in ( [ eq - hvlim ] ) .",
    "the @xmath57 in the @xmath58 and @xmath5 terms in equations  [ eq - dnu ] and  [ eq - h ] simply reflect that limits on @xmath29 and @xmath59 are plus or minus the quoted error . as stated in section  [ s - mod ] the terms",

    "since the discussion has followed the work of @xcite the model used in that reference is used as an example for producing constraints on the physics parameters .",
    "it is also a constraint on the particular model as well .",
    "the values for the model dependent parameters in @xcite are @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( which add to one ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . note that with this parameter set and the observational constraints the common leading term , the @xmath1 term , in ( [ eq - dqcdab ] ) and ( [ eq - hvlim ] ) dominate the constraints on the parameters .",
    "the constraints are @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 the look back time for the constraints is the average look back time of the @xmath1 observations at a redshift of 1.54 equal to 9.4 gigayears or roughly @xmath68 of the age of the universe .",
    "the observational constraints are evaluated via rms summing of the @xmath8 @xmath1 and @xmath0 terms for each parameter .",
    "this assumes that the @xmath8 errors are centered on zero rather than the `` measured '' values of the observations .",
    "it was noted earlier that the @xmath31 model parameter has a range of model values .",
    "figure  [ fig - qcdr ] shows the variation of the limit on @xmath69 as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the observational constraints on the physics parameters are dominated by the @xmath1 term both because of its less stringent observational limit and by the larger coefficient in the model of @xcite .",
    "that model , however , predicts a relationship between a variation of @xmath1 and a variation of @xmath0 given by @xmath70 the model therefore predicts the fractional variation of @xmath1 should be smaller than the variation of @xmath0 by a factor of 1/36 .",
    "it is of some interest to see how the constraints on the physics parameters change if this model dependent limit of @xmath71 on the fractional change of @xmath1 is imposed .",

    "this constraint severely limits the parameter space of theories that predict significant fractional changes in @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4",
    "it is difficult to test for time variability of the primary particle physics parameters such as the quantum chromodynamic scale , the higgs vacuum expectation value and the yukawa couplings .",
    "it is , however , relatively easy to use spectra of objects in the early universe to test for time variability of dimensionless fundamental constants whose numerical values depend on the physics parameters .",
    "individually the constants only constrain a combination of the parameters but combining the observational constraints on the variability of two or more constants provides model dependent constraints on the fractional variability of the qcd scale and a combination of the fractional variability of the higgs vev and the yukawa couplings .",
    "introduction of an additional model dependent parameter sets limits on the fractional variability of the higgs vev and the yukawa couplings separately .",
    "the constraints on the fractional time variability of the physics parameters limits the parameter space of new physics theories that require a time variability of any of the three basic physics parameters .",
    "it is recommended that observed constraints on the variability of dimensionless fundamental constants become another important tool in evaluating the validity of non - standard physics and cosmology theories .",
