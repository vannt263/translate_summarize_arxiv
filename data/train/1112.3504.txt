    "there has long been interest in resonance effects which arise when collision partners form a long - lived intermediate complex @xcite .",
    "recently , this interest was reinforced by experimental progress in cold atomic and molecular collisions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "an isolated resonance can be associated with a pole of the scattering matrix either in the complex energy ( ce ) or the complex angular momentum ( cam ) plane .",
    "two types of poles are closely related and contain essentially the same amount of information . however , since observables of interest such as integral ( ics ) and differential ( dcs ) cross sections are given by partial wave sums ( pws ) over total angular momentum @xmath0 , the cam ( regge ) poles prove to be more convenient for identifying and quantifying resonance effects . transforming a pws into a sum of integrals , _",
    "e.g. _ , by means of the poisson sum formula , and then evaluating contributions from regge poles often allows to account for the resonance pattern observed in a dcs @xcite-@xcite or an ics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "applications of the cam approach range from elastic collisions of atoms with protons @xcite and electrons @xcite,@xcite to atom - diatom chemical reactions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "numerous techniques have been proposed for determination of regge pole positions and residues in single channel potential scattering ( for a review see @xcite ) , among others direct solution of the schroedinger equation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , or of the corresponding non - linear milne equation @xcite for complex values of @xmath0 . for realistic reactive systems",
    "the number of open channel is large , root search in the complex @xmath0 plane is not viable , and one has to resort to pade reconstruction of @xmath1-matrix elements @xcite .",
    "this leaves a class of systems with a relatively few channels , for which many of the single channel techniques do not work , and yet one wishes to avoid the use of pade approximants .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to propose a direct method for calculating cam poles positions and residues for such systems .",
    "these include , among others , inelastic and reactive systems at low energies , feshbach resonances , collisions involving two - level atoms @xcite , and spin flip scattering @xcite .",
    "we will also look for the evidence of non - adiabatic effects in the behaviour of regge trajectories . for recent efforts in this direction",
    "we refer the reader to ref.@xcite , where the amplitude - phase method of refs.@xcite has been extended to dirac electrons .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we give a brief description of the method which generalises the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to a multichannel case . in sect .",
    "iii we consider a two - channel case designed to mimic electron - atom scattering below the second excitation threshold .",
    "section iv considers the same problem in the adiabatic approximation . in sect .",
    "v we use the obtained pole positions and residues to evaluate resonance contributions to elastic and inelastic integral cross sections .",

    "consider a time - independent scattering problem described by @xmath2 coupled radial equations [ we set to unity the particle s mass , @xmath3 , and choose @xmath4 , thus converting to atomic units ( a.u , ) ] , @xmath5\\hat{i } + { \\hat{v}}(r ) \\ } { { \\bf \\psi}}(r)=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the energy , @xmath0 is the total angular momentum , @xmath7 is the unit matrix , and @xmath8 is an @xmath9 hermitian potential matrix , such that @xmath10 we will assume that the constant values @xmath11 are arranged in such a way that @xmath12 , and require that a solution of eq.([1 ] ) , given by a complex vector @xmath13^t$ ] , is regular at the origin , @xmath14 furthermore , we are interested in scattering solutions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which for large @xmath17 contain an incoming wave in only the @xmath18-th channel . assuming that the potential @xmath8 reaches its asymptotic form ( [ 2 ] ) sufficiently rapidly , as @xmath19 for the channel wavefunctions we have @xmath20 , { \\quad}n , m=1,2 ... n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the hankel functions of the first and second kind , respectively , @xmath23 , and the asymptotic wave vector @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 for",
    "now we will assume that all channels are open , @xmath26 so that all @xmath24 are real valued .",
    "for each real value of the energy @xmath6 we wish to find complex value(s ) @xmath27 , such that the @xmath1-matrix elements @xmath28 would diverge , @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic of the corresponding solution of eq.([1 ] ) ( regge state ) will contain only outgoing waves generated by the emissive complex centrifugal potential @xmath30/2r^2 $ ] .    in order to obtain regge trajectory(s ) @xmath31 we integrate eq.([1 ] ) for an arbitrary complex value of the angular momentum @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) sufficiently far into the asymptotic region , evaluate the @xmath1-matrix elements , and repeat the procedure until a ( regge ) pole of the @xmath1-matrix is found @xcite . with possible applications of the theory to electron - atom collisions in mind , we consider a potential matrix which has a coulomb singularity at the origin , so that its taylor expansion takes the form @xmath33 as in the one - channel case @xcite the singularity of @xmath8 prevents imposing the boundary condition ( [ 3 ] ) directly at @xmath34 .",
    "following @xcite we represent the solution of eq .",
    "( 1)as a power series , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , are constant vector coefficients satisfying recursion relations @xmath38 with @xmath39 , whose explicit solution reads @xmath40^{-1}\\sum_{l=0}^{j}\\hat{k}_l { { \\bf u}}_{j - l } , { \\quad}j\\ge0.{\\quad}{\\quad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the recursion scheme is initialised by specifying the so far undefined initial vector @xmath41 .",
    "this can be chosen in @xmath2 different ways , e.g. , ( the last subscript indicates the component of the vector @xmath42 ) @xmath43 to yield @xmath2 linearly independent solutions , whose values at some @xmath44 for a suitably chosen @xmath45 . @xmath46",
    "provide @xmath2 sets of initial conditions for eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "this can now be integrated numerically ( a nag integrator @xcite is used in this work ) to a sufficiently large @xmath47 where @xmath48 , { \\quad}n , m=1,2 ... n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constant matrices , to be determined numerically .",
    "the physical scattering states ( [ 4 ] ) are linear combinations of @xmath51 , @xmath52 with @xmath53 chosen so that the coefficients multiplying the hankel functions of the second kind ( incoming waves ) add up to @xmath54 i.e. , @xmath55 . as a result , for the @xmath1-matrix we have @xmath56_{nn'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is readily seen that the @xmath1-matrix elements diverge if and only if @xmath57 is singular , so that the condition for a regge pole at a ( real ) energy @xmath6 reads @xmath58 starting with a reasonable initial guess for @xmath32 and recalculating the l.h.s . of eq.([15 ] ) in each step , one can use a standard routine for finding zeroes of @xmath59 ( a nag root finder @xcite is used in this work ) to determine the accurate pole position @xmath31 .",
    "the residues @xmath60 are readily obtained by integrating eq.([1 ] ) for a value of @xmath32 close to @xmath31 and taking the limit ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "finally , in the case some of the channels are closed , with corresponding @xmath24 s in eq.([4a ] ) purely imaginary , equation ( [ 15 ] ) applies , and ensures that the regge state does not have components which grow exponentially as @xmath19 .",
    "after this brief summary , in the next sections we apply the method to a model two - channel @xmath61 problem .",
    "next we consider a two - channel scattering problem with a potential matrix defined by @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the potential shown in fig.1 can be seen as a crude model for an inelastic electron - atom collision below the threshold of the second inelastic channel .",
    "the diagonal terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two similar thomas - fermi type potentials , representing the interaction between an electron and an atom in the first excited and the ground state , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath67 is the excitation energy , and the interaction between the channels occurs in the outer layer of the atom , @xmath68 .",
    "regge trajectories ( curves @xmath69 vs. @xmath70 ) are shown in fig . 2 for arbitrary @xmath71 , @xmath72 a.u . , @xmath73 a.u . and",
    "@xmath74 a.u .",
    "for uncoupled channels ( @xmath75 ) , there are two regge trajectories , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . since the two potentials only differ by a constant shift @xmath67 , @xmath78 , and the two regge trajectories in fig . 2 coincide , as shown by the dot - dashed line .",
    "interaction between the channels removes the degeneracy and yields two distinct trajectories as shown in fig.2 for @xmath79 a.u .",
    ", @xmath80 a.u . , and @xmath81 a.u . (",
    "solid ) .",
    "the trajectory labelled @xmath82 exhibits a type of behaviour often seen in potential scattering @xcite . as the energy increases , so does @xmath76 , and the trajectory curves away from the real @xmath32-axis in a smooth manner . the second trajectory , labelled @xmath83 leaves the real axis much more rapidly , and shortly thereafter intersects itself , describing a loop in the first quadrant of the cam plane .",
    "this behaviour , to our knowledge not observed in one - channel scattering problems , is one of our central results . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate it to be a consequence of non - adiabatic effects .",
    "further insight can be gained by considering the two regge trajectories in the adiabatic approximation . diagonalising the potential matrix @xmath84 for each value of @xmath47 yields two adiabatic curves , @xmath85 shown in fig.1 by dashed lines .",
    "the first @xmath82 curve acquires an additional barrier , while the second one @xmath83 has an additional well , both roughly proportional to @xmath86 . neglecting non - adiabatic coupling , i.e. , replacing in eq.([1 ] ) @xmath87 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yields two uncoupled equations and two adiabatic regge trajectories shown in fig.2 by dashed lines .",
    "the first adiabatic trajectory is close to the exact trajectory @xmath82 in fig.2 , whose imaginary part grows slowly with the energy , since the corresponding metastable state is stabilised by the effective barrier shown in fig.1 .",
    "the second exact trajectory @xmath83 corresponds to the adiabatic trajectory for the barrierless potential @xmath88 . comparing these two regge trajectories",
    "suggests that self - intersection of the exact curve in fig.2 is caused by the non - adiabatic transitions not taken into account by the approximation ( [ 19])-([20 ] ) .",
    "one important application of the cam theory is in the identification and quantitative analysis of resonance patterns which occur in elastic , inelastic and reactive integral cross sections ( ics ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a resonance is likely to affect an ics at an energy @xmath89 for which the corresponding regge trajectory approaches a real integer value of the angular momentum @xcite,@xcite .",
    "( the requirement is readily understood if one recalls that at negative energies the condition for a true bound state is that @xmath0 take a physical integer value . )",
    "this condition is satisfied for the trajectory ( i ) in fig . 2 which approaches @xmath90 for @xmath91 a.u .",
    "next we use this example in order to check the accuracy of the pole positions and residues obtained in sect .",
    "the four icss are given by the partial wave sums @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the wave vector in the incoming channel , and @xmath94 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the pws ( [ 21 ] ) can be separated into the resonance and background contributions , @xmath95 where the resonance term is given by the mullholland formula @xcite , @xcite , @xcite    @xmath96}{1+\\exp(-2\\pi i \\bar{\\lambda } ) } , \\ ] ]    @xmath97 and a @xmath98 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "exact composition of the background term @xmath99 is described elsewhere @xcite , its essential property being smooth behaviour in the region where an ics is affected by the resonance .",
    "figure 3 shows the residues trajectories ( curves @xmath100 vs. @xmath101 first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) evaluated for the regge trajectory ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    the full icss given by the pws ( [ 21 ] ) , the resonance term ( [ 22 ] ) , and the background term obtained as the difference between the two , are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the resonance terms @xmath102 account for most of the resonance structure at @xmath91 a.u .",
    "we note that the trajectory ( i ) in fig .",
    "2 originates , at low angular momenta , from a bound rather than a metastable state of the two coupled wells .",
    "thus , as in the case of proton impact on neutral atoms @xcite and also electron - atoms collisions @xcite , one can expect eqs.([21a])-([22 ] ) to provide an efficient separation of the resonance contribution and to probe important physics .",
    "discussion of the distinction between two types of trajectories and a modification of the mulholland formula can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "extension of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to a multichannel case will be given elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we advocate a direct method for calculating regge pole positions and residues , suitable for systems with a relatively small number of channels .",
    "the method is applied to a simple model designed to mimic electron - atom scattering at energies between the first and the second excitation thresholds .",
    "it is shown that inter - channel coupling splits degenerate regge trajectories into ones approximately corresponding to the two adiabatic potentials . beyond the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "non - adiabatic effects are seen to be responsible for self intersection of the trajectory @xmath83 shown in fig.2 .",
    "the effect of loop formation has not , to our knowledge , been observed in single channel scattering .",
    "finally , the simple model developed here can be improved e.g. , by a careful choice of the potential matrix or by including , if necessary , additional @xmath0-dependent terms in eq.([1 ] ) . the possibility to use the method for a more accurate description of inelastic electron - atom scattering",
    "will be discussed in our future work .",
    "suffice it to say that this development promises a powerful approach to low - energy scattering with the possibility to probe regge resonances and the feshbach resonances occurring in bose - einstein condesates .",
