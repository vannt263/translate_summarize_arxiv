    "<S> of course , a detailed model in this direction is not easy to obtain and is out of the scope of this work .    in ref.@xcite we considered the possibility of generating a light tc scalar boson based on the use of the bethe - salpeter equation and its normalization condition , as a function of the @xmath28 group and the respective fermionic representation . in that work we discussed how difficult was to generate a light scalar composite ; what was possible , for example in the case of fermions in the fundamental representation , only for a specific ( and large ) number of fermions and moderate @xmath92 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a different possibility for generating a light composite in a type of see saw mechanism in a two - scale tc model , and a small scalar mass is again generated in similar conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the mixing mechanism that we propose here may be extended to models with more than one tc group , although it is also possible to envisage that in this case we shall need a more complex etc interaction in order to mix the different groups .    </S>",
    "<S> a point to be noted is that the possibility of obtaining a light composite scalar according to the approach discussed in ref.@xcite , first obtained in @xcite , is that this result is a direct consequence of extreme walking ( or quasi - conformal ) technicolor theories , where the asymptotic self - energy behavior is described by eq.(5 ) , this same behavior must also be present to generate a large mixing ( @xmath86 ) , necessary to obtain a light scalar boson mass of approximately a few hundred gev in a two - scale model . in this work we identified </S>",
    "<S> that , regardless of the approach used for generating a light composite scalar boson , the behavior exhibited by extreme walking ( or quasi - conformal ) technicolor theories is the main feature needed in any model to produce a light composite scalar boson . </S>"
