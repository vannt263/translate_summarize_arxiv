    "quantum chromodynamics describes the strong interactions of quarks of gluons .",
    "nevertheless , these particles are not experimentally detected as the physical states are formed by hadrons .",
    "few methods link the description in terms of qcd parameters to the properties of the hadronic bound states . among these are qcd sum rules @xcite , lattice",
    "qcd @xcite , chiral perturbation theory @xcite and the @xmath2-expansion @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on the method of qcd sum rules where the notion of quark - hadron - duality ( qhd ) plays a dominant role .",
    "the optical theorem provides the basis for connecting theoretical and phenomenological quantities .",
    "it relates physical measurable observables like the cross section for hadron production to theoretical quantities usually expressed by correlators of two- or three - point functions . in the euclidean domain",
    "this correlator can be theoretically calculated by means of the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "the leading terms are given by the perturbative expansion which is supplemented by the condensate contributions .",
    "this can be compared to the corresponding quantity extracted from experiment and in this way it is possible to extract information about the system or the qcd parameters .",
    "one of the limitations of the sum rules already becomes visible .",
    "approaching from a perturbative side , the correlator does not include real nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "consequently the analysis must be performed in a so - called ` sum - rule - window ' where the ope of the correlator is under control and the system still reacts sensitive to the hadronic parameters .",
    "furthermore , in practical applications the experimental spectral density is usually only known for the lowest ground states . to estimate the missing information on the phenomenological side , the integral over the experimental spectral density",
    "is then assumed to equal the integral over the theoretical spectral density above a certain threshold energy @xmath3 .",
    "this is the assumption of global quark - hadron - duality .",
    "though being one of the basic assumptions in qcd sum rules its range of applicability has only been scarcely explored .",
    "the foundation of qhd was laid in @xcite .",
    "whereas in semileptonic decays and lepton scattering the concept of duality is under active investigation , e.g. @xcite , qhd in the context of qcd sum rules has only recently be reinitiated by shifman , see @xcite and references therein .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss both the practical and conceptual aspects related to qhd .",
    "the main part will focus on the charmonium system where new measurements from bes @xcite in the region between 3.7 gev and 4.8 gev have improved the experimental situation significantly . since also the theoretical spectral density can be calculated this allows a thorough comparison and a stringent test of qhd .",
    "we finally extend these investigations to the upsilon system .",
    "the following section is dedicated to an estimate of the uncertainty related to the use of qhd . after a discussion of the theoretical contributions we give a description for the threshold parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the error on @xmath3 indicates the uncertainty related to the assumption of qhd . in section 3",
    "we investigate the charmonium cross section in more detail .",
    "apart from the @xmath4-resonances the non - resonant @xmath5-production has a significant impact on the cross section .",
    "we present a model description for this background and extract the resonance parameters of the @xmath6 .",
    "section 4 discusses the more conceptual issues since the notion of qhd in heavy - heavy - systems is far from trivial .",
    "the following section concentrates on the upsilon system .",
    "in particular , we give an estimate for the threshold parameter @xmath3 , present a model for the non - resonant @xmath7-production and check the validity of the ope .",
    "finally we summarise the results .",
    "in this work we investigate charm production in @xmath8-collisions @xmath9 via the optical theorem , the experimental cross section is related to the imaginary part of the correlator @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 the charm vector current is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the electric charge of the charm quark .    in principle one",
    "can calculate @xmath14 perturbatively , take the imaginary part and compare it to the measured cross section .",
    "however , a perturbative calculation of @xmath14 is valid only in the euclidean domain .",
    "an analytic continuation to the minkowski region neglects terms which are small in euclidean but can become important in minkowski .",
    "thus , with the assumption of global qhd , only smeared quantities can be compared .",
    "a further complication arises in the theoretical calculation of @xmath14 . in the deep euclidean domain",
    "the perturbative expansion works well .",
    "however , usually one is interested in a region closer to threshold . here",
    "the coulomb - like behaviour of the charmonium system shows up and the theoretical expansion converges badly .",
    "these large terms can be resummed with the help of the theory of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite . since we will employ the theoretical prediction for @xmath14 and the theoretical spectral density in this and the following chapters , first we briefly discuss these contributions and then return to a discussion of qhd .",
    "the theory of nrqcd provides a consistent framework to treat the problem of heavy quark - antiquark production close to threshold .",
    "the contributions can be described by a nonrelativistic schrdinger equation and systematically calculated in time - independent perturbation theory .",
    "the correlator is expressed in terms of a green s function @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of colours , @xmath18 and @xmath19 represents the pole mass .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is a perturbative coefficient needed for the matching between the full and the nonrelativistic theory .",
    "the contributions from nrqcd are summarised in the potential .",
    "the green s function obeys the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath21 here @xmath22 represents the coulomb potential and @xmath23 contains the nlo and nnlo corrections .",
    "details on the solution of this equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the green s function contains pole contributions below threshold and a continuum above threshold . in order to construct the theoretical continuum spectral density for the full energy range it is not sufficient to use the spectral density from nrqcd which is only valid for low velocities .",
    "in addition , one must include the results from perturbation theory which gives @xmath24 at large velocities . at intermediate velocities",
    "one can perform a matching between both regimes . in @xcite",
    "this procedure is described in detail .",
    "the resulting theoretical spectral density is shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.a ] and we denote the spectral density by @xmath25 .    this spectral density is supposed to give a good approximation to the experimental spectral density at high energies .",
    "decreasing the energy , one approaches the resonance region . here",
    "@xmath25 will fail to reproduce the resonances . but naively assuming qhd , a smearing of @xmath26 over a ` sufficiently large ' energy range should give a good approximation to the same smearing with @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the notion of qhd is more subtle and the naive expectation is not correct .",
    "the optical theorem relates the two representations by a dispersion relation which includes all values of the energy .",
    "so only the complete phenomenological result can be compared to the full theoretical result which also includes the poles of the green s function . in section 4",
    "we discuss the concept of qhd in more detail and present quantitative estimates for the individual contributions .",

    "[ fig:2.a ] we have plotted @xmath25 and the measured cross section in the energy range between @xmath27 . at these energies",
    "@xmath25 clearly lies above the data points . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from the theoretical poles turns out to be smaller than the contribution from the lowest @xmath4-states .    to test the accuracy of qhd from a comparison of the theoretical and phenomenological spectral densities we choose the moments",
    "@xmath28 the weight function @xmath29 corresponds to the one usually used in the moment sum rules to extract the quark masses .",
    "another popular weight function is @xmath30 which is used in the borel sum rules . since the analysis and the results are very similar in both cases we will not perform an independent analysis for the borel sum rules in this work . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are free parameters which can be used to move the sum rules to a region convenient for the analysis .",
    "large @xmath31 will improve the perturbative expansion while for small or even negative @xmath31 the analysis will react very sensitive to the bound states .",
    "small @xmath32 will result in a relative flat weight function and high @xmath32 put the emphasis on the low energy region . as will be discussed in chapter 4 ,",
    "@xmath33 should be taken to infinity to establish a precise relation between the phenomenological and theoretical part where they are connected by an euclidean quantity .",
    "however , in practice the cross section is only measured up to a certain energy so above this energy one has to rely on the theoretical prediction for @xmath24 .",
    "when comparing both parts the integral above this energy is then equal .",
    "the experimental cross section can be interpreted as non - resonant background production of @xmath34-mesons and resonances of breit - wigner form . for a comparison to @xmath35",
    "it is interesting to separate these two contributions . in the next section",
    "we will give a model description of the background production which has been plotted as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.a ] and discuss the charmonium cross section in more detail . in this section we focus our attention on the most important issue in actual sum rule calculations and the basic question of qhd : how well can the experimental cross section be approximated by the theoretical spectral density and how large is the error on @xmath36 ?",
    "the bes data have been given directly in terms of @xmath37 and we will use these values as our reference for the experimental cross section . from the measured spectral density",
    "the light quark contribution must be subtracted . at these energies the light quarks",
    "can safely assumed to be massless and the high energy approximation @xcite provides a good description .",
    "apart from bes , the resonance properties of the @xmath4-states have been extracted in @xcite and of the @xmath38-states in @xcite .    in order to test a typical problem in the sum rules",
    "let us now assume that the only information we had from the experimental side were the resonance properties of the first @xmath39 bound states . with the assumption of qhd , the contribution from the higher states",
    "is then given by the integration of the theoretical spectral density @xmath25 above a threshold @xmath3 .",
    "the above question can then be formulated in a different way : what value of @xmath3 must be taken ?",
    "since the qcd sum rules are used to extract the heavy quark masses , the choice of @xmath3 influences the central value of the masses .",
    "furthermore the uncertainty in @xmath3 translates directly to the error of the masses and it is therefore important to have a reliable estimate of this uncertainty .",
    "there is no rigorous justification for a particular choice of @xmath3 . as a heuristic rule",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath3 should be given by about 250 mev above the highest included resonance . in this section",
    "we want to check if - and to what extend - this rule is valid .",
    "it will turn out that particular care must given to a possible background contribution . in chapter 5",
    "we will then apply the results obtained in this section to estimate @xmath3 in the upsilon system where no experimental information is available to fix this parameter .    to determine @xmath3 in the charmonium system we now compare the quantities @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant",

    "the upper limit of the integration is taken to infinity , @xmath47 .",

    "furthermore we note that the rule ` highest resonance plus 250 mev ' is strongly violated .",
    "taking only the lowest pole , @xmath54 , this is no surprise .",

    "( [ eq:2.f ] ) we have neglected the non - resonant @xmath62-production .",

    "subtracting these two descriptions should therefore give an estimate of the background contribution .",
    "the drawback of both methods is clear : in the first one the result is model dependent where in the second one it was assumed that qhd could already be used for states with @xmath64 . to include the background contribution one could either add this background explicitly to the second part of eq .",

    "we have estimated the uncertainty connected with the use of qhd . in the charmonium system qhd",

    "however , in this case we describe @xmath5-meson production , so the phase space should rather be given by the phase space the @xmath5-meson than that of the charm mass .",
    "as described above , the production of @xmath78 is suppressed to @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , for higher energies the other heavier thresholds open . consequently a threshold of @xmath97 would probably overestimate the background in the intermediate energy range .",
    "therefore we fix the threshold parameter to @xmath98 .",

    "the theoretical expansion depends on the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 : large values of @xmath31 and small @xmath32 move the moments to a safe perturbative region and the expansion in @xmath121 converges well . in principle , @xmath116 could thus be calculated to high accuracy . however , this region is of little phenomenological interest .",
    "usually in sum rules analyses one is interested in extracting information on the ground state or the quark masses . in order to be sensitive to these parameters",
    "the analysis must be performed relatively close to threshold . in this case",
    "the perturbative expansion does not converge well any more since large terms appear reflecting the coulombic structure of the charmonium system .",
    "these potentially large terms can be resummed with the method of nrqcd which sets up a systematic framework to treat these non - relativistic corrections .",
    "the result is expressed in terms of a green s function and can be directly evaluated at @xmath117 .",
    "its imaginary part shows poles below and a continuum spectral density above threshold .",
    "this qcd - based theoretical description has to be confronted to the measured cross section to which it is related by the optical theorem .",
    "as described in the last section , its behaviour is very complicated : it contains two sharp resonances and several higher resonances which are shifted into the continuum .",
    "it is obvious that the theoretical and phenomenological spectral density do not equal each other . in the euclidean region",
    "the theoretical expansion is truncated  as a series in @xmath121 and in higher condensates .",
    "if one were able to calculate @xmath14 in the euclidean domain exactly , one could analytically continue the result to the minkowski domain and take the imaginary part .",
    "the theoretical spectral density would equal the hadronic cross section .",
    "however , in practice only the truncated expansion is analytically continued to values of positive @xmath122 .",
    "small neglected terms in the euclidean domain can become large in the minkowski region and change the spectral density significantly .",
    "the origin and behaviour of such contributions have been discussed in @xcite .    in the ope condensates",
    "appear , the leading contribution is given by the gluon condensate : @xmath123 the analytic form of the functions @xmath124 and @xmath125 can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , its contribution to the moments is small for values of @xmath32 and @xmath31 used in this analysis .",
    "its contribution grows if one comes very close to threshold , for @xmath126 or for very large @xmath32 since here the moments test the nonperturbative region .",
    "now we want to compare the size of the individual theoretical and phenomenological contributions .",
    "in fact , this comparison is done in qcd sum rules to extract the charm and bottom quark masses since the moments show a strong dependence on the value of the mass .",
    "we fix the @xmath127-mass to @xmath128 @xcite . for the comparison we use a range of values for @xmath32 and @xmath31 somewhat larger than in typical sum rule applications . in table",

    "it can be seen that the sensitivity of the moments on the mass decreases for large values of @xmath31 .",
    "the change is due to the pole contribution since the continuum spectral density is practically independent of the mass .",

    "an important parameter in sum rule calculations of the bottom mass is the threshold parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the phenomenological moments are determined from the first six @xmath38-resonances and the theoretical spectral density above @xmath3 . with no background production this parameter",
    "would be estimated to lie about 250 mev above the @xmath141 . however , the non - resonant background , where it is not already included in the resonance parameters , will effectively lower this threshold . in chapter 2 two ways to estimate this parameter",
    "have been discussed , by a model description for the background and by assuming qhd already for states @xmath143 . in the first one we use the background of eq .",
    "( [ eq:5.a ] ) . in the region between @xmath144",

    "we assume qhd for states with @xmath148 .",
    "the background from this ansatz would reduce the threshold to @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , taking the average between both estimates , we suggest that a reasonable estimate for @xmath3 would be given by @xmath150 .    as in section 4",
    "we can compare the contributions from the theoretical and phenomenological moments .",
    "again we evaluate the moments in a region where threshold effects are important . in table",
    "[ tab:5.a ] we have collected the moments from the different sources . as input parameter for the mass we have used @xmath151 @xcite . for the employed values of @xmath32 and @xmath31 the dominance of the poles is less pronounced than in the charmonium .",
    "the theoretical moments differ by about 5% from the phenomenological ones .",
    "thus they show a better convergence than in the charmonium system . at @xmath57 and @xmath132 the theoretical calculation of the moments should not be trusted any more .",
    "now we look at the influence of the bottom mass on the moments . with a @xmath127-mass of @xmath152 the total theoretical moments for @xmath57 vary from 0.93 ( for @xmath51 ) to 0.47 ( @xmath132 ) and from 0.99 ( @xmath51 ) to 0.80 ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath153 . for @xmath154",
    "the moments for @xmath57 increase from 1.19 ( @xmath51 ) to 1.23 ( @xmath132 ) and from 1.1 ( @xmath51 ) to 1.24 ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath153 thus showing again the strong influence of the quark mass .",
    "in this work we have explored the cross section of @xmath8collisions in the charmonium and upsilon energy region . the experimental situation for the charmonium",
    "has significantly improved with the new results from bes @xcite .",
    "this allows a thorough comparison of the theoretical and experimental description for this energy range .",
    "these investigations have been applied to heavy - heavy systems .",
    "apart from the general discussions it is not clear if the concrete results could be generalised to e.g. heavy - light or light - light states since the underlying physical systems are different and their properties are rather determined from the dynamics of the light quarks .",
    "the main part of the paper has investigated the charmonium energy range .",
    "we have given a prescription for the threshold parameter @xmath3 which is needed to describe the experimental spectral density for large energies .",
    "the error on this quantity was estimated to @xmath155 which includes a possible variation of @xmath3 with @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the phenomenological cross section can be described as breit - wigner resonances and a non - resonant background production of @xmath62-mesons .",
    "we have presented a model for this background production based on perturbative qcd .",
    "the masses , the hadronic widths and the partial @xmath43widths of the states @xmath6 have been extracted from the bes data .",
    "so we obtain a direct theoretical description of the experimental cross section in terms of few resonance parameters with a @xmath107 .",
    "qcd sum rules use the identity of the theoretical and phenomenological moments related by the optical theorem and can be used to extract e.g. the quark masses or the ground state properties . in order to be sensitive to these parameters",
    "the moments must be evaluated in a region not too far from threshold .",
    "thus the contributions from nrqcd form an essential part on the theoretical side reflecting the fact that the underlying system is a coulombic one .",
    "the different contributions from the poles and the continuum part have been compared for different values of @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "section 5 has been devoted to the upsilon system . here",
    "the experimental situation is dissatisfactory .",
    "however , the results of the previous sections could be used to investigate several properties of this system : a model description of non - resonant @xmath156-production has been presented and the threshold parameter @xmath3 estimated . we have compared the different contributions to the theoretical and phenomenological moments and investigated the effect of the bottom mass .",
    "unfortunately the cross section is not well measured in the region above the @xmath135 .",
    "a more detailed knowledge would allow a better test of qhd in this energy region .",
    "the two basic pictures of qcd are related by qhd : the hadronic world and a description based on perturbative qcd in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "thus a better understanding of qhd could provide further insight into the structure and behaviour of nonperturbative contributions .",
