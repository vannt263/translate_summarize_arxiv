    "this analysis , which is an update of @xcite , aims at extracting flavour - separated parton distributions from a global nlo qcd analysis of inclusive dis and drell yan cross sections .",
    "the data set used @xcite ranges from the cornerstone dis data of bcdms and nmc , including recent data form hera ( neutral and charged current from h1 and zeus ) , to the fixed - target drell - yan measurements of e866 , e605 and e772 . as for neutrino dis , ccfr cross section measurements - now available @xcite as a model independent result - together with the cdhsw data provide key constraints for the strange sea determination .",
    "the parton distributions @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,   are parametrised and evolved in the nlo fixed - flavour scheme .",
    "the strange sea is not constrained to have the same shape as the light sea , and @xmath8 is allowed with the condition @xmath9 that ensures zero net strangeness .",
    "details of the fit can be found in @xcite and in a forthcoming paper .",
    "our focus in this communication will be on the strange sea asymmetry @xmath10 .",
    "the requirement @xmath11   is not dictated by any symmetry of qcd , and qualitative models predict a significant asymmetry in the high @xmath12 region arising from long - living higher fock states containing intrinsic @xmath13 pairs @xcite .",
    "experimental constraints on @xmath10 come from charged current @xmath14 and @xmath15 cross sections : the quantity @xmath16(xu_v+xd_v)\\ ] ] valid at lo for an isoscalar target , exhibits the sensitivity to the strange sea asymmetry ( valence distributions are well constrained by other data ) .",
    "both ccfr and cdhsw provide high @xmath12 data : the latter tend to be higher for neutrinos ( see figure [ myfig ] ) , whereas the two series of data are in agreement for antineutrinos .",
    "the nutev collaboration has recently released new data on @xmath0 dis with dimuon production @xcite .",
    "these data are not statistically significant for @xmath17 but constrain the strange sea at small @xmath12 and affect indirectly the large-@xmath12 region because of the strange number sum rule @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , nutev data can not be included in a global cross section fit in the form they are published",
    ".    with both cdhsw and ccfr data sets we found that the strange sea asymmetry is @xmath19 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . removing the ccfr data leads to a larger asymmetry , @xmath20 , as already shown by our previous results @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the dominant systematic uncertainty ( flux normalisation ) for ccfr neutrino data is fitted to @xmath21 ( the data are scaled up by 4% ) , irrespectively of the assumptions on the strange sea . on the other hand",
    ", there is the well known problem of the cdhsw @xmath22 shape for @xmath23 which do not follow the qcd prediction .",
    "a reasonable attitude is to take both data sets into account in the global analysis keeping in mind that one of them or both may be affected by uncontrolled experimental effects .",
    "a recent study by cteq @xcite , which includes the nutev dimuon data , shows that these data drive a bump of @xmath24 in the medium - large @xmath12 region , in qualitative agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the nutev experiment uses a fit to the measured ratios of neutral current to charged current cross sections @xmath25 to extract .",
    "they obtain @xmath26 @xcite which is @xmath27 away from the fit result by the lep ewwg of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a related quantity is the paschos - wolfenstein ratio @xmath29 , given by @xmath30 at lo for an isoscalar target .",
    "discussion of the nutev determination of in the context of the present work is relevant since @xmath31 must be corrected if there is a fractional neutron excess @xmath32 or if @xmath8 . in this case",
    "@xmath31 reads @xcite     @xmath33   \\nonumber \\\\        & \\equiv &   \\frac{1}{2 } - \\sin^2 \\theta_{w } + \\delta r^{- } \\label{deltar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correction @xmath34 as well as a properly propagated error can be computed using the parton distributions of this analysis . with",
    "all data sets one obtains @xmath35 , without the ccfr data set the significant strange sea asymmetry leads to the value @xmath36 . whereas the nutev collaboration reports the value @xcite @xmath37 .",
    "taking the difference between these corrections one can roughly estimate the corresponding shift of : without the ccfr data the strange sea asymmetry has the required magnitude to reduce @xmath38 to @xmath39 , and with all data included @xmath40 , which is now @xmath41 away from the standard model fit value . here",
    "the reduction is due to the neutron excess correction which is larger in our case , but approximately half of this discrepancy can be understood by taking into account the experimental cuts and cross talk between nc and cc using the model described in @xcite .",
    "however for a realistic estimate a full mc study is required .",
    "another relevant point is the parton distribution uncertainty , which is found to be one order of magnitude larger than the reported nutev value .    since the @xcite the nutev collaboration have re - evaluated this parton distribution error adjusting the value @xmath42 to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "note that the error in the evaluation have been independently found and originally reported to the nutev collaboration by s. alekhin and s. kulagin .",
