    "blazars are believed to be radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which have a relativistic jet with its axis closely aligned to the line of sight . due to doppler boosting",
    ", the jet emission dominates that of the accretion disk ( and of the host galaxy ) over a large energy domain .",
    "it can extend up to the very high - energy ( vhe ) range ( @xmath0100@xmath1 ) in some cases .",
    "@xmath2 blazar observations offer the possibility of investigating the physics of jets more deeply , including particle acceleration and energy extraction in the vicinity of the agn s central `` engine '' .",
    "the identification of the vhe @xmath3-ray production region with the base of the jet is indeed suggested by their highly variable emission , which has been already observed down to sub - hour time - scales  [ @xcite ] , thus indicating a small spatial extension via a simple causality argument .    since the detection by the whipple observatory of markarian  421 ( mkn  421 ) [ @xcite ] and markarian  501 ( mkn  501 )  [ @xcite ] as the first extragalactic @xmath2 sources ,",
    "blazars have been intensively observed by ground - based cherenkov atmospheric @xmath3-ray detectors . the cat ( cherenkov array at thmis ) imaging telescope  [ @xcite ] , which operates above @xmath4 since autumn 1996 , has studied mkn  421 and mkn  501 in different states of activity .",
    "the complete analyses are detailed in the literature  [ @xcite ] ; here we present the main results of this work .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the light curves of these two blazars , as sampled by cat during their most active periods , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "both sources are highly variable and a few series of bursts can be distinguished .",
    "for instance , the flux of mkn  421 was measured at a level of @xmath5 above @xmath4 during the night of march 23/24 , 2001 ( jd 2451992 ) : this is comparable to the highest @xmath2 flux ever recorded by cat , i.e. , that of mkn  501 in the night of april 15/16 , 1997 ( jd 2450554 ) , which reached @xmath6 . during these flaring periods both sources underwent a large night - to - night variability on several occasions .",
    "mkn  421 is , however , unique since it has also exhibited important flux variations within a single night . as an example",
    ", its light curves for three nights from the 3@xmath7 to the 5@xmath8 february 2000 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "while the fluxes recorded by cat during the first and last nights were stable , the source activity changed dramatically in a few hours during the second night : it was reduced by a factor of @xmath9 in @xmath10  hour and by a factor of @xmath11 in @xmath12  hours .",
    "consequently , the @xmath3-ray emitting zone must be very compact , with a size @xmath13@xmath14  light - hours if one assumes a typical value of @xmath14 for the geometric doppler factor ( which reduces the time - scale in the observer frame ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , mkn  501 clearly showed a curved spectrum in 1997 , with a @xmath3-ray peak lying above the cat threshold .",
    "mkn  421 is less extreme : its 1998 time - averaged spectrum can be well fitted by a simple power - law with a differential index @xmath3@xmath15@xmath16 , but there is some indication of curvature for the 2000 spectrum due to a larger signal - to - background ratio  [ @xcite ] .",
    "the even higher statistics gathered in the single night of march 23@xmath7 , 2001 , yielded a more accurate determination of this curvature , with a differential spectrum @xmath17 .",
    "still preliminary at the time of the conference , this result has been confirmed since then  [ @xcite ] .    the question of spectral variability of @xmath2 blazars has been the subject of a long debate .",
    "the hardening of the mkn  501 spectrum during flares was firstly discovered by cat on the basis of a hardness ratio during its 1997 flaring period  [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) by the shift in the peak energy of the sed : @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 for the time - averaged spectrum and @xmath21@xmath19@xmath22 for the highest flare of april 16@xmath8 .",
    "recently , the hegra experiment observed a similar feature by comparing the 1997 and 1998 - 99 time - averaged spectra  [ @xcite ] . to address this question concerning mkn  421 , we compiled its spectral measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , in the @xmath23 plane of spectral parameters assuming a power - law shape @xmath24 ( this hypothesis is justified even in the case of a curved sectrum , see  [ @xcite ] for details ) . despite the general trend seen in this figure , definite conclusions on a possible spectral variability would be premature : simultaneous observations of more flares by different cherenkov telescopes are still needed in order to exclude possible systematic effects between experiments ( see  [ @xcite ] for a discussion ) .",
    "the multi - wavelength sed of mkn  501 can be explained by leptonic models  [ @xcite ] .",
    "the best example to date is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , where a homogeneous synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model fits well the x - ray and vhe spectra obtained by the beppo - sax satellite and cat for two dates in april 1997  [ @xcite ] . in this framework ,",
    "the cat observations of mkn  421 indicate that the peak energy of the inverse compton contribution to its sed is significantly lower than the telescope detection threshold .",
    "this is not surprising since _ (",
    "i ) _ the corresponding synchrotron peak is known to be lower than that of mkn  501 , and _",
    "( ii ) _ leptonic models predict a strong correlation between x - rays and @xmath3-rays .",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) by the correlated spectral hardening in both energy ranges between the two dates . as for mkn  421",
    ", a correlation has been observed many times  [ @xcite ] , but always in terms of integrated ( and not differential ) fluxes due to the lack of statistics .",
    "in addition the vhe spectral variability of mkn  421 has not been clearly proven yet .",
    "moreover , alternative scenarios based on an e@xmath25p plasma and proton - induced cascades in the jet are still successful in interpreting @xmath2 blazars seds  [ @xcite ] .",
    "the study of the dynamic aspects of blazar jet emission , including the temporal and spectral correlations between various wavelengths , is thus required in the future in order to accurately constrain existing models and to understand the particle acceleration and cooling processes occurring at the sub - parsec scale in jets .",
    "it should help in discriminating between these models and allow , in particular , to address more deeply the crucial problem of the plasma jet content .",
