    "we consider the motion of a rigid planar body , whose shape is not necessarily circular , immersed in a two - dimensional perfect fluid .",
    "we assume that the vorticity of the fluid vanishes , but we allow for a non - zero amount of circulation around the rigid body .",
    "this dynamical system is of fundamental importance in aerodynamics and was studied , among others , by chaplygin , kutta , lamb , and zhukowski ; see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a detailed overview of the literature and background information on this subject .",
    "a consequence of the non - zero circulation is the presence of a gyroscopic _ lift force _ acting on the rigid body , which is proportional to the circulation .",
    "this force is referred to as the _ kutta - zhukowski force_.    while various aspects of this dynamical system have been discussed throughout the fluid - dynamical literature ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite for a modern account ) , deeper insight into the hamiltonian structure of this system had to wait until the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors identified a hamiltonian structure for the equations of motion found by chaplygin and used this structure to shed further light onto the integrability of the system and to investigate chaoticity .",
    "this pioneering work raised several questions worth investigating in their own right .",
    "the first and foremost is that the non - canonical hamiltonian structure of the rigid body with circulation is obtained _ by inspection _ , which immediately begs the question whether there are other , more fundamental reasons as to why this should be so . in this paper",
    ", we address this question following the approach of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we model the dynamics of the rigid body moving in a perfect fluid as a geodesic flow on an infinite - dimensional manifold . on this space ,",
    "several symmetry groups act , and by performing successive reductions with respect to each of these groups , we obtain the hamiltonian structure and equations of motion for the rigid body with circulation in a geometric way .",
    "this approach is also used in @xcite to derive the equations of motion for a rigid body interacting with point vortices .    in this geometric approach ,",
    "the symmetry groups of the fluid - solid problem are the _ * particle relabeling symmetry * _ group ( the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid reference space ) , and the _ * special euclidian group * _ @xmath0 of uniform solid - fluid translations and rotations . symplectic reduction with respect to the former group",
    "is equivalent to the specification of the vorticity field of the fluid : in the problem considered here , this amounts to requiring that the external vorticity vanishes and that there is a given amount of circulation around the body .",
    "the group @xmath0 acts on the system by combined solid - fluid transformations .",
    "after poisson reduction with respect to this group , we obtain the hamiltonian structure of @xcite .",
    "one straightforward advantage of the geometric description is that it provides immediate insight into the dynamics , which might be harder to obtain by non - geometric means . as an illustration",
    ", we show that the symplectic leaves for the poisson structure obtained by @xcite are orbits of a certain _ * affine action * _ of @xmath0 onto @xmath1 , which we compute explicitly .",
    "we show that these leaves are paraboloids of revolution , hence providing a geometric interpretation of a result of chaplygin .",
    "an additional result of using geometric reduction is that we obtain a new interpretation for the classical kutta - zhukowski force . in particular , we show that the kutta - zhukowski force is proportional to the curvature of a natural fluid - dynamical connection , called the neumann connection , which encodes the influence of the rigid body on the surrounding fluid . in this way , we exhibit interesting parallels between the dynamics of the rigid body with circulation and that of a charged particle in a magnetic field : both systems are acted upon by a gyroscopic force , the kutta - zhukowski force and the lorentz force , respectively .",
    "the reduction procedure to recover the hamiltonian description of @xcite then turns out to be similar to the way in which @xcite derives the equations for a charged particle by including the magnetic field directly into the poisson structure .",
    "lastly , we also establish an analogue between the _ * kaluza - klein construction * _ for magnetic particles and the dynamics of the rigid body with circulation . in the conventional kaluza - klein description , the dynamics of the magnetic particle",
    "is made into a geodesic motion by extending the configuration space and including the magnetic potential into the metric .",
    "given the similarity between the lorentz and the kutta - zhukowski force , a natural question is then whether a similar geometric description exists for the rigid body with circulation .",
    "it turns out that this is indeed so : the extended configuration space in this case is a central extension of @xmath0 by means of natural cocycle , which is again related to the curvature giving rise to the kutta - zhukowksi force .",
    "this extension of @xmath0 is known as the _ * oscillator group * _ in quantum mechanics ; see @xcite .",
    "the rigid body with circulation is then described by geodesic motion on the oscillator group .",
    "our description of the rigid body with circulation as a geodesic flow on a central extension is similar to the work of @xcite , who showed that the korteweg - de vries equation can be interpreted as a geodesic motion on the virasoro group , an extension of the diffeomorphism group of the circle .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the similarity with the classical kaluza - klein picture can not be taken too far : in the kaluza - klein description , one modifies the metric to take into account the magnetic field , whereas we leave the metric on @xmath0 essentially unchanged and instead we deform the multiplication structure by means of a cocycle , giving rise to a central extension of @xmath0 .",
