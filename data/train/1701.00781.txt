    "since its formulation , quantum mechanics ( qm ) has always peaked the interest of individuals with its inherent mystery and its seemingly paradoxical , but experimentally reproducible , results . at the heart of this mystery",
    "is the superposition principle and the measurement problem .",
    "the situation has been nicely described by wallace @xcite : solutions of the measurement problem are often called ` interpretations of qm ' , the idea being that all such ` interpretations ' agree on the formalism and thus the experimental predictions \" , and thus the interpretation of qm in entropic dynamics @xcite _ _  _ _ will inevitably be discussed in the context of the measurement problem .",
    "ed differs from most physical theories . in most approaches to qm one starts with the formalism and the interpretation is appended to it , almost as an afterthought . in ed one starts with the interpretation , that is , one specifies what the ontic elements of the theory are , and only then one develops a formalism appropriate to describe , predict and control those ontic elements .",
    "for instance , to derive non - relativistic qm one starts from the assumption that particles have definite yet unknown positions and then one proceeds to derive ed as a non - dissipative diffusion .",
    "the solution to the measurement problem should address two problems : one is the problem of _ definite outcomes _ ( when and how does the wavefunction collapses ) , the other is the problem of the _ preferred basis _ , which is also known as the _ basis degeneracy problem_. ( for a review see @xcite . ) both problems as well as the interpretation of qm in ed will be addressed in the body of this paper .",
    "entropic dynamics ( ed ) derives laws of physics as an example entropic inference .",
    "this view is extremely constraining .",
    "for example , there is no room for quantum probabilities   probabilities are neither classical nor quantum , they are tools for reasoning that have universal applicability . related to this is the fact that once one claims that the wavefunction is an epistemic object ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 is a probability ) then its time evolution  the updating of @xmath1  is not at all arbitrary",
    ". the laws of dynamics must be dictated by the usual rules of inference .",
    "there is one feature of the unified bayesian / entropic inference approach that turns out to be particularly relevant to the foundations of quantum theory .",
    "the issue in question is von neumann s proposal of two modes of evolution for the wavefunction , either continuous and unitary as given by the schrdinger equation , or discontinuous and stochastic as described by the projection postulate ",
    "the collapse of the wavefunction .",
    "once one adopts the broader inference scheme that recognizes the consistency of bayesian updating with entropic updating @xcite the apparent conflict between the two modes of wavefunction evolution disappears : the wavefunction is an epistemic object meant to be updated on the basis of new information .",
    "when the system is isolated the evolution is obtained by a continuous entropic updating which leads to a unitary evolution described by the schrdinger equation .",
    "when , in a measurement , the information is in the form of discrete data the bayesian update is discontinuous and the wavefunction collapses .",
    "both forms of updating coexist harmoniously within the framework of ed @xcite .    in the von neumann measurement scheme ,",
    "the macroscopic measurement device is treated quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "the initial state of the measuring device is generally given as @xmath2 in indicating the device is in the ready  or reference  state .",
    "an interaction between the system , in an initial state @xmath3 and the measuring device leads to a state in which the system becomes entangled with the device s",
    "pointer  variable , @xmath4 the standard von neumann measurement scheme involves interactions such that the system and measurement device evolve into a special entagled state called a biorthogonal  state ( _ i.e. _ , there are no cross terms in eq.([vn a ] ) , @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) schlosshauer .",
    "thus , a measurement that finds the pointer variable in state @xmath7 seemingly allows the observer to infer that the system is in state @xmath8 .",
    "however , the right hand side of eq.([vn a ] ) can be expanded in some other basis .",
    "there is no ontological matter of fact about wihich outcome has been obtained .",
    "thus we have problems : not only we have a never observed phenomenon of macroscopic entanglement but we also have a _ problem of no definite outcomes _ also called the _ preferred basis problem _ or the _ basis degeneracy problem _ @xcite@xcite . in ed",
    "the collapse of the wave function involves a straightforward application of bayes theorem to find @xmath9 , the probability the system is in state @xmath8 given a detection of the pointer variable in state @xmath10 . in ed it is possible and convenient to introduce observables  other than position ( _ e.g. _ , momentum , energy , and so on ) but these are not attributes of the system , they are attributes of their probability distributions .",
    "while positions are ontic  elements , these other observables are purely epistemic ; they are properties of the wave function , not of the system @xcite .",
    "these ideas can be pushed to an extreme when discussing the notion of the weak value @xcite-@xcite of an operator @xmath11 in which the system is prepared in an initial state @xmath12 and post - selected in state @xmath13 , @xmath14weak values are complex and therefore strictly they can not be observed , and yet they may still be _",
    "inferred_. from the perspective of an inference framework such as ed the common reference to ` observables ' is misguided .",
    "it should be replaced by bell s term ` beables ' @xcite for ontic elements such as particle positions , and perhaps ` inferables ' for those epistemic elements associated to probability distributions .",
    "after a brief review of ed and of the simplest or direct type of measurement @xcite , we discuss the less direct types of measurement  the von neumann and weak measurements  in which information about the system is inferred by observation of another system , the pointer device , to which it has been suitably correlated .",
    "finally we discuss weak values in the context of ed .",
    "here we give a brief overview of ed emphasizing those ideas relevant to the measurement problem .",
    "( for a review with more extended references see ed . )",
    "the system consists of @xmath15 particles living in a flat euclidean space @xmath16 with metric @xmath17 .",
    "the positions of the particles have _ definite _ values which are however _ unknown_. we already see that ed differs from the copenhagen interpretation :",
    "in the latter , positions become definite only as a result of the measurement process .",
    "positions are denoted @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the particle and @xmath20 denotes the spatial coordinates .",
    "the microstate @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , is a point in the @xmath23 dimensional configuration space .",
    "the objective is to predict the particle positions and their motion .",
    "the first assumption is that particles follow continuous trajectories so that the motion can be analyzed as a sequence of short steps .",
    "we use the method of maximum entropy to find the probability @xmath24 that the particles take infinitesimally short steps from @xmath18 to @xmath25 .",
    "the information that the steps are infinitesimal is given by @xmath15 constraints , @xmath26(eventually we take the limit @xmath27 imposing continuous motion ) . to introduce correlations",
    "we impose one additional constraint , @xmath28where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is another small constant , and @xmath31 is the drift  potential .",
    "it is this single constraint acting on the @xmath23 dimensional configuration space that leads to quantum effects such as interference and entanglement .",
    "the physical nature of the @xmath31 potential need not concern us here .",
    "we merely postulate its existence and note @xmath31 is closely related to the phase of the wave function .",
    "affects the motion of particles it plays the role of a pilot wave or an electromagnetic field .",
    "indeed , @xmath31 is _ as real as _ the vector potential @xmath32 .",
    "the close relation between them is the gauge symmetry ( see @xcite ) . ]",
    "the result of maximizing entropy with an appropriate choice of lagrange multipliers leads to @xmath33~ , \\label{prob xp / x a}\\]]where @xmath34 is a normalization constant , @xmath35 is the time interval between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the @xmath38 s are particle - specific constants called masses ,  and @xmath39 is a constant that fixes the units of time relative to those of length and mass @xcite . once we have @xmath24 for an infinitesimal step we can ask how a probability distribution @xmath40 evolves from one step to the next step @xmath41 by considering , @xmath42 iterating this process for very short steps allows one to find the evolution of @xmath43 to be given by the fokker - planck equation ( an explication can be found in @xcite ) , @xmath44where @xmath45 is the velocity of the probability flow in configuration space or _ current velocity _ , @xmath46equation ( [ fp b ] ) describes a standard diffusion . to obtain a non - dissipative  dynamics the choice of drift potential @xmath31 must be revised after each step @xmath35 , which means that the drift potential , or equivalently , the phase  @xmath47 , is promoted to a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "the correct updating , @xmath48 , follows from requiring that a certain functional @xmath49 $ ] be conserved .",
    "the result is that the coupled evolution of @xmath50 and @xmath47 is given by a conjugate pair of hamilton s equations , @xmath51the ensemble  hamiltonian  @xmath52 is chosen so that the first equation above reproduces ( [ fp b ] ) in which case the second equation in ( [ hamilton ] ) becomes a hamilton - jacobi equation .",

    "the parameter @xmath55defines the value of planck s constant @xmath56 .",
    "the formulation of ed is now complete : combining @xmath50 and @xmath47 into a single complex function , @xmath57 with @xmath58 allows us to rewrite ( [ hamilton ] ) as a _ linear _ schrdinger equation,@xmath59    at this point we can adopt the standard hilbert space formalism to represent the epistemic state @xmath60 as a vector , @xmath61we can express @xmath62 in bases other than the position basis @xmath63 and we can write the schrdinger equation as a manifestly unitary evolution , @xmath64 for some suitably chosen @xmath65 .",
    "the particles have definite positions but their brownian paths are not smooth ; there is no momentum associated to the trajectories .",
    "one can define the usual quantum momentum  the operator that generates translations of the wavefunction .",
    "in general it does not have definite values .",
    "its values , which are inferred by the process of measurement and detection , are not an ontic  attribute of the particles but an epistemic  attribute of the wave function .",
    "the simplest type of quantum measurement , studied in @xcite , consists of the direct detection of the particle s position .",
    "since the wavefunction is purely epistemic , the collapse problem does not arise .",
    "the collapse  is nothing but a bayesian update from a prior to a posterior and in general the preferred basis problem for a single orthonormal vector does not apply @xcite . in this context ,",
    "a question of interest in ed is how do observables other than position arise was also answered in @xcite .",
    "consider , for simplicity , a particle that lives on a discrete lattice , so that if the state is @xmath66 in a more complicated  measurement the particle is subject to additional interactions right before reaching the position detector .",
    "such a complicated setup @xmath67 is described by a particular _ unitary _ evolution @xmath68 .",
    "the particle will evolve to the position @xmath69 with certainty provided it was initially in a state @xmath70 such that @xmath71 .",
    "since the set @xmath72 is orthonormal and complete , the set @xmath73 is also orthonormal and complete . to figure out the effect of @xmath67 on some generic initial state vector @xmath62 , expand as @xmath74where@xmath75 .",
    "then the state @xmath62 evolves according to @xmath68 into the new state at a later time @xmath76 , @xmath77which , invoking the born rule for _ position _ measurements , implies that the probability of finding the particle at the position @xmath78 is @xmath79 .    from a physics perspective",
    "there is nothing more to say but we can adopt _ a different language _ : we can _ say _ that the particle has been measured  _ as if _ it had earlier been in the state @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the setup @xmath67 is a complicated device that in principle measures  all operators of the form @xmath80 where the eigenvalues @xmath81 are _ arbitrary _ scalars .",
    "note that there is no implication that the particle previously had or now currently has the value @xmath81  this is just a figure of speech .",
    "von neumann measurements are explored briefly and bayes rule is used as an instance of  collapse \" in amplification processes @xcite .",
    "in this section , the von neumann and weak measurement schemes are naturally implemented into ed .",
    "we will attempt to be particularly careful in our word choice such that a _ measurement _ in ed involves first an _ interaction _ with an apparatus or with another auxiliary system with which it becomes entangled .",
    "this step does not collapse the wave function .",
    "then there is the actual _ detection _ , which is the step that collapses or localizes the distribution to the value detected by the observer .",
    "here we present ed s solution to the problem of _ definite outcomes _ and discuss the  collapse \" of the wavefunction .",
    "entropic dynamics is a theory of inference and the rules for probability updating are precisely the same as in any other inference problem .",
    "there is no such thing as quantum probabilities . the problem of  physical \" collapse is never encountered in ed for the same reason that it is not encountered in epistemic classical probability theory .",
    "no - one asks how the probability distribution of a die role collapses during measurement ; this just follows from the inductive logic expressed by bayes rule .",
    "when a particle with wave function @xmath82 is detected at @xmath83 with certainty the prior probability @xmath84 is updated to @xmath85 .",
    "a more realistic detector is represented ( for the purpose of inference ) by a likelihood function @xmath86 that gives the probability of a detection @xmath87 when the particle is at @xmath36 .",
    "then the probability that the particle was at @xmath36 given the detection event @xmath87 is given by bayes rule , @xmath88 an idealized device detects the presence of a particle in an infinitesimally small region centered around @xmath83 so the likelihood function in this case is @xmath89 and indeed @xmath90 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a von neumann measurement scheme @xcite is one in which a detection of the pointer variable in state @xmath91 gives @xmath92 with certainty and it potentially suffers from the _ preferred basis problem _ or equivalently the _ basis degeneracy problem _ @xcite .",
    "we circumvent this problem by using bayes theorem and a specific unitary evolution to entangle the system and measurement device via the weak measurement scheme @xcite . in ed",
    "the only positions are beables , all other ",
    "observables \" must be inferred from detections of position and strictly are properties of the wavefunction or probability distribution . in this sense ,",
    "quantities such as momentum or energy are not ontic ( in ed ) but rather are seen to be convenient parameters for expressing the probability distribution in question , that is , they are epistemic quantities verifying @xcite . for instance , an expectation value can be a useful parameter for expressing our knowledge of the state of a system but in general it is a property belonging to the probability distribution rather than being something persistently expressed through the system as an ontic variable is .",
    "the simplest pointer measurement device we can imagine in this framework uses the position of a single test particle @xmath36 as its pointer variable .",
    "the construction of a macroscopic pointer measurement device is an exercise in the central limit theory for a many particle system @xcite .    to avoid clutter we will neglect normalization factors until we reach the level of probability distributions near the end of the calculation .",
    "an ideal pointer measuring device in ed is one in which a test particle has a definite initial state , @xmath93 in position space and we will let @xmath94 for simplicity .",
    "we consider a more general case in which the test particle is in the initial state , @xmath95 which reproduces the ideal measurement device when @xmath96 after normalization .",
    "using the completeness relationship @xmath97 , the state of the test particle can be represented in momentum space as , @xmath98 the quantum system to be measured with the pointer device is a preselected or prepared superposition state of the eigenvectors of @xmath99 , @xmath100 we will consider a situation in which the measuring device is coupled to the system to be measured by a strong coupling or interaction hamiltonian , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the canonical conjugate of the pointer variable and thereby generates translations in the pointer variable @xmath103 and @xmath104 is a function with compact support near the time of measurement and integrates to unity @xcite .",
    "we can assume that the coupling hamiltonian will dominate over the full hamiltonian for the , assumed small , period of measurement .",
    "the time evolution of our entangled system is , @xmath105 @xmath106 which , in the position space representation , is @xmath107 this is a superposition of potentially overlapping gaussian distributions having peaks at the eigenvalues of @xmath11 .",
    "when the gaussian distributions overlap we have a so - called  weak measurement \" @xcite ; when the gaussian distributions are neatly resolved we have a `` strong '' or von neumann measurement .",
    "the joint probability of the system , @xmath108 in the present case , we may infer the probability the system of interest is accurately _",
    "describable _ by a particular eigenvector @xmath92 by making detections of the position of the pointer particle following notions from the  detection in ed : ... \" section and @xcite .",
    "this is given by the conditional probability , @xmath109 thus the detection of the test particle at @xmath110 allows us to infer the probability that the system is in a state with eigenvalue @xmath111 .",
    "bayes rule leads to a partial collapse because the initial state of the pointer variable is itself uncertain .",
    "in the limit that @xmath112 for @xmath113 ( after normalization ) we have an ideal ( von neumann ) measurement .",
    "the measurement always produces one of its eigenstates with probability @xmath114 , and from a detection of the position @xmath110 we can infer the eigenstate @xmath92 with probability 1 using ( [ 22a ] ) .",
    "because position is ontic in ed it always plays the role of the preferred basis , which eliminates the basis degeneracy problem .",
    "so far we have taken into account the uncertainty in the preparation of the pointer variable but we have assumed that the pointer variable @xmath36 of the test particle has been measured precisely . if the detection of @xmath36 is noisy then there is a second source of uncertainty quantified by @xmath115 given by equation ( [ detect ] ) .",
    "the probability of the value @xmath111 is @xmath116 by compounding a unitary detector @xmath117 from ( [ unitary ] ) , with the weak measurement devices above one can map a non - position pointer variable @xmath118 to a position pointer variable @xmath103 which in principle allows for a more robust set of operators @xmath119 to be measured .",
    "we may then consider coupling hamiltonians @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the fourier conjugate to @xmath118 , and before detection apply @xmath122 to put the pointer variable in the position basis .",
    "the weak value @xmath123 of a hermitian operator @xmath99 was first introduced by aharonov , albert , and vaidman @xcite ( aav ) in 1989 as an interesting application of a weak measurement which gives nonintuitive results ( recent review @xcite ) .",
    "what is particularly significant in aav s paper @xcite is not that they defined an odd quantity associated tor @xmath99 , but rather they found , after a series of approximations ( see @xcite ) a way in which @xmath124 could be `` measured . ''",
    "a weak value is a complex number which may lie outside the set of eigenvalues of @xmath99 when @xmath125 is sufficiently small . due to this",
    ", the interpretation of weak values has had a ",
    "colorful history `` @xcite , much of which can be summarized by the question , ' ' are weak values ontic properties of a particle ? \" .    in ed , variables other than position either are inferred from position ,",
    "are useful parameters in the position probability distribution of the particle , or may be a particularly convenient basis for representing the position space probability distribution @xmath126 due to the completeness relations . from this perspective",
    "it is clear that inferring @xmath124 does not indicate that the particle is ontically expressing @xmath124 .",
    "consider the final state of an entangled detector from ( [ ent ] ) , given we consider the state is post - selected into @xmath127 : @xmath128 which in the position space representation gives , @xmath129 given the set up configuration is in the desired range of validity @xcite . in the ed framework",

    "because @xmath124 appears as a parameter in the probability distribution of @xmath36 , we may consider @xmath132 and invert the problem to ask , ",
    "what is the probability the parameter @xmath124 has a certain value given a detection of the pointer particle at @xmath110 \"  that is we may use @xmath133-\\overline{x})^2}{2\\bigtriangleup^2/n}\\big)$ ] and the parameter estimation scheme in @xcite to find @xmath124 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "there are several potentially interesting weak values but in particular consider the operator @xmath134 post selected in a momentum state , @xmath135 which is proportional to the full wavefunction and @xmath136 is a constant that will be removed after normalization @xcite .",
    "et al _ show that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath137 are proportional to the position and momentum shifts of the pointer variable and claim they are measuring the wavefunction . from the ed perspective it is more appropriate to state that the value of the wavefunction at each @xmath36 is being inferred .",
    "if the value of @xmath137 is inferred with certainty then it is possible to solve for the phase of the wavefunction ( up to an additive constant @xmath138 ) and also infer the values of the drift potential and its derivatives .",
    "this provides a link to wiseman s use of weak values to measure the probability current in bohmian mechanics @xcite . especially in cases as exotic as the above , ed takes the standpoint that weak values and quantities other than position ( energy , momentum , etc . )",
    "are best considered as epistemic",
    " inferables \" rather than ontic beables or observables .",
    "we have discussed the von neumann and weak measurement schemes in the framework of entropic dynamics and have offered solutions to the problems of _ definite values _ and of the _ preferred basis_. from the perspective of ed quantum mechanics is a framework for updating probabilities , for processing information .",
    "when the quantum system is left undisturbed it evolves smoothly and the appropriate tool for updating is the schrdinger equation ; when the system is coupled to a measuring device the appropriate tool to handle information in the form of data is bayes theorem .",
    "there is no conflict : information of different types is handled differently .",
    "the fact that position plays a privileged role  positions are `` beables ''  provides us with a natural pointer variable . in ed quantities",
    "normally called `` observables '' such as energy and momentum , and the quantities called `` weak values '' are not ontic properties of the system .",
    "they are epistemic properties of the wave function .",
    "none of these quantities are beables and they can not be observed directly . instead they can be inferred by appropriate position measurements either of the system itself or of another system with which it is suitably entangled .",
    "such quantities should more appropriately be referred as \" inferables . ",
    "it is the explicit recognition of the ontic nature of positions vs the epistemic nature of other inferables that allows one to circumvent the paradoxes and confusion that have surrounded the problem of measurement .",
