    "analyzing causality is one of the central tasks of science since it influences decision making in such diverse domains as natural , social and health sciences .",
    "causality is the relationship between two events , if changes of one ( cause ) trigger changes of the other ( effect ) @xcite . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "a causal analysis model was developed for analyzing causality of multivariate and nonlinear data ( unlabeled in nature ) . in that model , different self - organizing maps ( soms )",
    "@xcite for input and output data sets were networked using a weight association based on the connection prototype feature vector similarity .",
    "given such soms , the similarity weights conditional on a given input could be assigned to the neurons of the output som .",
    "such a weighted som pattern of the output is described by two information types : @xmath0 the weight distribution and @xmath1 the property ( prototype feature vector ) distribution . for assessing output changes by input changes ,",
    "it is crucial to measure the property difference of weighted som patterns .",
    "there have been many attempts to measure the dissimilarity between two distributions ( patterns ) such as the minkowski and the shanon s entropy families @xcite , the quadratic form distance @xcite and the earth mover s distance ( emd ) @xcite . for weights with adaptive neurons in a weighted som pattern , we found the emd to be the most suitable method in measuring the dissimilarity of weighted som patterns .",
    "the emd , as the others , aims to provide a numerical value to define only a notion of the overall resemblance of patterns .",
    "it can not differentiate between weighted som patterns if they have the same dissimilarity but different properties .",
    "therefore , we introduce a method , called property emd ( pemd ) , to measure the property difference by individual feature differences in the pattern change . however , it is still difficult to represent and to compare the overall property dissimilarity in the change for high dimensional data .",
    "it is also difficult to observe possible feature values that gain the pattern change .    due to the limitations of quantitative approaches , we propose a visualization approach for measuring the property change of weighted som patterns along with the pemd .",
    "our visualization integrates colors and graphical shape objects of star glyph to represent the pattern information in the change . using this approach ,",
    "the property dissimilarity of weighted som patterns can be captured with the size and the direction of the change .",
    "possible feature values that gain the pattern change can also be observed by exploring regions of interest in weighted som patterns .",
    "ecological data is used to demonstrate that our approach is useful for the pattern property comparison in the pattern change .",
    "the experimental results show that our approach provides the change information considered for causal analysis in an effective visual way .",
    "a self - organizing map ( som ) @xcite projects high dimensional data onto a low dimensional ( typically @xmath2-dimensional ) grid map space . a set of neurons of the map , which are prototype feature vectors adaptively projected for original feature vectors , reflects the data properties . using the causal analysis model in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "a weight distribution is estimated on the property distribution of the output som for a given input .",

    "the perceptual dissimilarity between two weighted som patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be measured by observing the color properties in the highly weighted neurons .",
    "the patterns @xmath20 and @xmath21 are different patterns by their color properties although they have the same distance in relation to their changes from @xmath22 . the pattern @xmath23 shows the change in two perspectives by the two different color properties highlighted in @xmath24 .",
    "such differences can be measured using the @xmath4-dimensional color property .",
    "nonetheless , it is still difficult to estimate the size and the direction of the change with respect to the pattern property .",

    "the most used families of functions are the minkowski and the shanon s entropy families @xcite",
    ". however , these functions do not match perceptual dissimilarity well since they only compare weights of corresponding fixed bins @xcite .",
    "the families do not use the similarity information across neighboring bins such as adaptive neurons of weighted som patterns .",
    "when considering the information across bins , the quadratic form distance ( qfd ) @xcite and the earth mover s distance ( emd ) @xcite are the most used functions .",
    "however , the qfd tends to overestimate the dissimilarity of patterns as the weight of each bin is simultaneously compared with weights across all bins @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the emd uses the ground distance of feature vectors across bins for the minimum weight flow providing better perceptual matches .",
    "the emd , as the other functions , aims to provide a numeric value to define only a notion of the overall resemblance of patterns .",
    "the overall dissimilarity itself can not differentiate between weighted som patterns when the feature vector distance and the weight distribution have the same relation but different feature values such as @xmath20 and @xmath21 from @xmath22 in fig .",
    "this explains that such patterns can be further differentiated by the information of the pattern property in relation to the weight distribution .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to identify the two different properties in @xmath24 that gain the change to @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in an attempt to handle these issues ,",
    "we propose a visualization approach based on a metric using the emd to measure the property change of weighted som patterns .",
    "in this section , we propose a visualization approach that uses a metric for measuring the property difference of weighted som patterns in order to capture the change information based on the property dissimilarity .      in order to measure the pattern property difference",
    ", we introduce an extended function of the emd , called property emd ( pemd ) .",
    "the pemd measures the individual feature difference in the pattern change based on the capability of the emd for the pattern dissimilarity measure .    according to @xcite , the emd between two weighted som patterns @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 is defined as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ground distance function and @xmath31 is the minimum cost flow under constraints : @xmath32 : @xmath33 , @xmath34 : @xmath35 , @xmath36 : @xmath37 , and @xmath38 min@xmath39 . the weighted som patterns @xmath27 and @xmath28 are based on the same som ; thus , they have the same number ( @xmath9 ) of neurons and their weights equally sum to @xmath40 .",
    "based on the emd , the difference of a feature @xmath17 in @xmath28 for given @xmath27 can be measured by a function as follows : @xmath41 the direction of the feature change is accounted for by the difference measure . this distance",
    "is then defined as the resulting feature difference in the change normalized by the total work flow of the emd .",
    "the feature difference is normalized to avoid favoring larger differences between pattern changes in the comparison .",

    "the emd is also measured and scaled by the maximum emd of the data space for the dissimilarity comparison . as the results show in table [ tbl2 ] ,",
    "the individual feature differences can be used to explain the property difference between the patterns @xmath20 and @xmath21 changed from @xmath22 , which show the same emd .",
    "however , it does not explain that the patterns @xmath24 and @xmath23 are not the same as shown by the emd .",
    "this shows that the patterns can be further explained by possible feature values that gain the pattern change .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to compare the overall property dissimilarity if the dimensionality is high .",
    "therefore , we propose a visualization approach in the next section for better analyzing the pattern change of high dimensional data based on the property difference by the pemd .",
    "our visualization integrates colors and graphical objects , which are perceptually orthogonal @xcite , to represent the pattern dissimilarity of high dimensional data .",
    "hue colors and star glyph shape objects are used to view a weighted som pattern .",
    "the scaled hue colors in fig . [ fig : myapp]@xmath3 are used to indicate high weight by red and low weight by blue .",
    "the graphical object mapping of prototype feature vector into a star glyph shape represents a neuron property in a som .",
    "a star glyph @xcite has @xmath15 evenly angled branches emanating from a central point in the same ordering of @xmath15 dimensions .",

    "the pemd value for each feature is scaled in the range of [ @xmath44 for the visualization .",
    "the average of the pemd values is used to indicate the direction of the overall property change by applying it to the color saturation .",
    "the property shape is filled with the direction color ; red for increase , blue for decrease and white for no change .",
    "the property direction color can differentiate between property changes if they have the same property shape but opposite directions of any individual feature changes .",
    "the possible value changes in each feature can be visualized depending on the user selection of regions ( e.g. highly weighted regions ) .",
    "the possible value changes are indicated by red and blue for increase and decrease respectively ( empty dots for the reference pattern and full dots for the changed pattern ) .",
    "the line with red or blue from the center to 0.1 indicates the direction of the individual feature change for increase or decrease , respectively .",
    "the overall property dissimilarity of the patterns can then be captured by the property shape variation with the change information in the fixed orientation .",
