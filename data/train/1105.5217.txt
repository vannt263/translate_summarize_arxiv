    "atomic nuclei are known to exhibit a wide range of collective excitations  @xcite . amongst them , giant resonances ( grs ) are of particular interest in our understanding of collective motion in nuclei .",
    "macroscopically , they are associated to high energy modes of small amplitude vibration of the entire nucleus .",
    "microscopically , they can be described , in a first approximation , by coherent superpositions of one - particle one - hole ( 1p1h ) excitations  @xcite .",
    "giant resonances lie usually at energies above the light particle emission threshold . different kinds of decay are commonly distinguished .",
    "for instance , direct decay occurs when one particle is emitted leaving the daughter nucleus in a single hole state .",
    "however , the decay is sequential when two - particle two - hole ( 2p2h ) configurations are populated by the residual interaction .",
    "the direct decay by nucleon emission is of particular interest as the emitted nucleon can give a glimpse on the microscopic structure of the gr . as such",
    ", it is an experimental tool of choice to study grs  ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    collective motion in nuclei can be investigated with microscopic theories based on time - dependent energy - density - functional ( tdedf ) approaches .",
    "in particular , the time - dependent hartree - fock(-bogoliubov ) equations in their linearized version ( q)rpa  @xcite , have been widely used to study various gr strength distributions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . when a proper treatment of the continuum is accounted for ,",
    "those methods are also capable of describing direct neutron and proton decay .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate the link between the 1p1h structure of giant resonances and their direct - decay pattern . the scalar - isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) is studied in several closed - shell nuclei .",
    "the response to a scalar monopole excitation in the small amplitude regime is computed using the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) formalism @xcite , based on a modern skyrme functional  @xcite . to study gmr direct - decay ,",
    "the calculations are performed in a large spherical grid , allowing for a spatial separation of the nucleus from the emitted nucleons to the continuum .",
    "similar tdhf calculations have been performed in the past with schematic energy density functionals to study gmr widths and lifetimes from direct decay  @xcite .",
    "these quantities were extracted from the time evolution of the number of emitted nucleons . in the present paper ,",
    "new informations are obtained by computing energy spectra of the nucleons which are emitted in the direct - decay of the gmr .",
    "the structure of these spectra is then analyzed in terms of single - hole configurations of the @xmath0 daughter nucleus .",
    "theoretical framework and numerical details are presented in section  [ sec : framework ] .",
    "results obtained on several closed - shell nuclei are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "the one - body density matrix is used to compute expectation value of one - body operators for which tdhf is optimized  @xcite .",
    "information on vibrational modes such as energy can then be obtained through the evolution of their corresponding multipole moment .",
    "for instance , the excitation of a monopole mode @xmath7 on top of the ground state induces an oscillation of the expectation value of the monopole moment  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) creates ( annihilates ) a nucleon in @xmath11 with spin @xmath12 and isospin @xmath13 . in this mode",
    ", @xmath14 oscillates at a frequency @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ground state energy and @xmath17 the energy of the excited state .",
    "the linearization of the tdhf equation leads to the rpa  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "tdhf calculations in the small amplitude limit contain all the rpa residual interaction which is responsible for the collectivity of giant resonances .",
    "using tdhf codes ensures that the same edf is used to determine both the hf ground - state and the dynamics thanks to the structure of the tdhf equation .",
    "it is then equivalent to fully self - consistent rpa codes .",
    "in addition to energies of grs , tdhf has been used to study their strength distribution  @xcite , their life - time and escape width  @xcite , and their anharmonicities  @xcite .",
    "escape width and landau damping are accounted for in tdhf , however , two - body correlations responsible for the spreading width are neglected .",
    "inclusion of pairing correlations is possible in the tdhf - bogoliubov theory  @xcite , however its numerical applications  @xcite are time - consuming and prevent the use of large spatial grid as in the present study .",
    "the nucleus is assumed to be in its ground state at initial time .",
    "an external field @xmath18 is applied , where @xmath19 is the intensity of the perturbation and @xmath20 is its time profile .",

    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath34 which , in the particular case where @xmath35 , reduces to the strength function . for bound states ,",

    "the spectral response , @xmath41 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft_respfunc ] ) , can then be used to analyze microscopically the strength distribution of the gmr .",
    "the energy spectra of emitted ( free ) nucleons can be computed by evaluating overlaps between the single - particle wave - functions @xmath42 ( with degeneracy @xmath43 in spherical symmetry ) and spherical plane waves @xmath44 of energy @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the nucleon mass .",

    "the hf initial condition is computed in a @xmath59  fm box with the same radial spacing . at initial time , all single - particle wave - functions vanish for @xmath60 .    in principle",
    ", the nucleon spectrum should be determined at large distances from the nucleus to avoid any long - range interaction with the latter . in practice ,",
    "the integral in eq .",

    "note that the upper limit of the integral in the definition of the monopole moment in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorf ] ) is chosen to be @xmath61 to avoid a divergence of @xmath63 due to emitted nucleons .    to account for the finite size of the box , only spherical plane waves vanishing at @xmath62",

    "to avoid spurious peaks from this discretization , @xmath65 is convoluted with a normalized gaussian distribution in energy with a standard deviation of @xmath66  kev .",
    "to illustrate the method , let us start with a microscopic analysis of the gmr direct decay in @xmath67 .",

    "first we note that proton and neutron spectra have similar global features , as expected for light @xmath86 nuclei , although the proton spectra are shifted by @xmath87  mev due to the coulomb repulsion .",

    "using a simple single - particle decomposition , the microscopic structure and ( direct ) decay of the gmr in some spherical nuclei has been studied .",
    "the gmr strength was obtained by two techniques : @xmath100 from the real - time small amplitude monopole response and @xmath101 from the spectra of emitted nucleons . in @xmath101 ,",
    "each microscopic contribution has to be shifted by the single - particle energy of the hole state .    although both techniques lead to almost identical monopole strengths , their microscopic structure ( i.e. , their decomposition onto the single - particle quantum numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) may be very different .",
    "this is understood by the fact that , although gmr energies are usually above the nucleon emission thresholds , only part of the particle - hole states lie in the continuum . those which are bound are coupled to unbound states via the rpa residual interaction which is responsible for the collectivity of the vibration .",
    "this is illustrated , e.g. , in monopole spectra of neutron - rich tin isotopes : although both protons and neutrons contribute to the monopole vibration , only neutrons can be emitted because protons are more bound and have to overcome the coulomb barrier .",
    "a major improvement of the method would be to include two - body correlations , like pairing interaction and collision terms .",
    "the latter are known to be responsible for the additional spreading width of giant resonances as well as a fragmentation of their strength function  @xcite .",
    "they are also expected to modify the structure of the spectra of emitted nucleons by coupling 1p1h states to 2p2h .",
    "a first step would be to use the extended - tdhf @xcite or the time - dependent density - matrix  @xcite formalisms .",
    "because of computational limitations , spherical symmetry ( and thus , only monopole vibrations ) might be first considered .",
