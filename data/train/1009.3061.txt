    "a classical question in differential geometry is that of finding canonical metrics on manifolds . for example , the well - known yamabe problem asks whether a given smooth compact riemannian manifold @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , has a constant scalar curvature metric @xmath3 which is conformal to @xmath4 .",
    "this problem was posed by yamabe in 1960 , and a complete solution to the problem is due to the combined work of yamabe , trudinger , aubin , and schoen .",

    "constant scalar curvature metrics arise as critical points in a conformal class of the volume normalized einstein - hilbert functional . to see this , recall that the einstein - hilbert functional is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature of @xmath4 and @xmath7 is the volume form of @xmath4 . under a conformal variation @xmath8 ,",

    ", one can take the variation of the volume normalized @xmath11 functional : @xmath14    one might like to pose an analogue to the yamabe problem in a non - smooth setting ; for example , on piecewise flat manifolds .",
    "to do so , one would need a discrete notion of curvature and of conformal variations . in @xcite ,",
    "such concepts are defined on piecewise flat manifolds .",
    "the constant scalar curvature metrics in the piecewise flat setting should be somehow analogous to those in the smooth setting . therefore , these metrics are defined to be critical points of a discrete analogue of the einstein - hilbert functional defined by t. regge in 1961 @xcite .",
    "we will call this functional the einstein - hilbert - regge functional , and we will denote it @xmath15 . see @xcite for a survey of the study of this functional as an action for general relativity and of its use in the regge calculus and lattice gravity . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the @xmath15 functional converges to the @xmath11 functional in a certain sense .",
    "the idea of discretizing smooth geometric notions forms the basis for fields such as discrete differential geometry and discrete exterior calculus ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "the behavior of the @xmath15 functional was analyzed on the double tetrahedron .",
    "the double tetrahedron is the simplest triangulation of @xmath0 , and it is not simplicial .",

    "we will define a certain class of metrics on the boundary complexes of cyclic polytopes known as cyclic length metrics in  4 , and we will collect some combinatorial results . in  5 , we will show that the metrics do indeed have constant scalar curvature .",

    "the angles of a face are determined by the edge lengths via the cosine law .",
    "the dihedral angles of a tetrahedron can then be calculated from the angles at the faces using the spherical cosine law .",

    "however , in the discrete case , since the formula for volume of a simplex is quite complicated , one may also consider a normalization which is linear in the edge lengths .",

    "the vertex set @xmath252 yields a type @xmath164 tetrahedron , while the set @xmath253 gives a type @xmath254 tetrahedron .",
    "secondly , let @xmath255 .",
    "again , we simply list the tetrahedra containing @xmath42 and note their types .",
    "the vertex set @xmath253 generates a type @xmath256 tetrahedron .",
    "however , all of the sets @xmath249 ; @xmath250 ; and @xmath252 yield type @xmath140 tetrahedra .    for the third case ,",
    "let @xmath257 . in this case ,",
    "notice that only one of @xmath152 and @xmath248 can be vertices of a tetrahedron , unless @xmath258 and @xmath259 . for the former case , the vertex sets @xmath249 and @xmath250 yield tetrahedra of type @xmath260 ,",
    "whereas @xmath252 gives a type @xmath261 tetrahedron . in the latter case ,",
    "the analysis is the same , but notice that only one of @xmath246 and @xmath247 can be vertices .",
    "finally , let @xmath262 .",
    "since there are @xmath124 edges in @xmath110 , corollary  [ edgecor ] implies that there are @xmath263 tetrahedra containing both @xmath42 and an edge that is not local to @xmath42 in @xmath110 .",
    "notice also that the tetrahedron with vertices @xmath264 contains @xmath42 and is not one of the @xmath263 tetrahedra previously mentioned .",

    "therefore the edge curvature of any given edge depends only on the length of that edge , so edges with equal length have equal edge curvature . by remark  [ cl is vt ] , the metric is vertex transitive , so the sets of edge lengths of the edges incident to each vertex are the same .",
    "together , these facts imply that for all @xmath77 , @xmath266 is constant .",
    "[ vertexcurve ] let @xmath29 be a cyclic length metric on @xmath109 .",

    "[ vvlem ] let @xmath29 be a cyclic length metric on @xmath109 . for all @xmath77 , @xmath272 .",
    "we begin the proof by letting @xmath118 .",
    "recall the definition of @xmath273 as given in definition  [ csc def ] . for any vertex @xmath199 , @xmath274 .",
    "note that this sum is over all tetrahedra containing @xmath98 . by lemma  [ fourdis].1 ,",
    "each vertex is contained in exactly @xmath275 tetrahedra .",
    "more precisely , each vertex is contained in four of each type @xmath164 tetrahedra for @xmath276 and four tetrahedra of type @xmath140 .",
    "thus we can split up @xmath277 into @xmath123 partial sums , one for each type of tetrahedron .",
    "note that every tetrahedron of type @xmath164 is geometrically identical , so the sum @xmath278 only varies in regards to the choice of vertices .    in the tetrahedra of type @xmath164",
    ", a given vertex @xmath98 has each of the sets of possible incident edges appear one time . in other words ,",
    "the vertex @xmath98 `` plays the role '' of each of the vertices @xmath279 in figure  [ t_p tetra ] or figure  [ t_m^o tetra ] .",
    "there are four possible sets of incident edges .",
    "thus for all @xmath199 , the partial sums of @xmath277 with respect to the tetrahedra of type @xmath138 are equal . since this holds for every type @xmath138 for @xmath280 the total sums @xmath277 are equal for all @xmath281 .",
    "thus , @xmath273 is constant , so @xmath282 for all @xmath77 .",
    "recall that @xmath283 , so @xmath272 as required",
    "..    the proof for @xmath119 follows in the same way .",
    "the only difference is that a vertex @xmath98 is contained in only two type @xmath143 tetrahedra .",
    "however , in this case , notice that all of the vertices have the same sets of incident edge lengths ( see figure  [ t_m^e tetra ] ) , so again the sum @xmath273 equal to the same constant for all @xmath51 .",
    "we now prove the main theorem of this section ; namely that cyclic length metrics on @xmath109 have constant scalar curvature .",
    "let @xmath29 be a cyclic length metric on @xmath109 .",
    "this metric is both @xmath75 and @xmath80 ; i.e. it satisfies both eq .",
    "[ lcsc eqn ] and eq .",
    "[ vcsc eqn ]",
    ".    we will begin by showing this metric is @xmath75 . by corollary  [ vertexcurve ] and lemma  [ lvlem ] : @xmath284 for all @xmath77 .",

    "as mentioned in definition  [ csc def ] , @xmath75 and @xmath80 metrics occur at critical points of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 functionals within a conformal class .",
    "we have shown that cyclic length metrics on @xmath109 are both @xmath75 and @xmath80 , and we would like to know with what frequency these metrics occur ; i.e. in which conformal classes these cyclic length metrics appear .",
    "one may hope that they occur in every conformal class .",
    "however the next proposition shows that this is not the case .",
    "recall from definition  [ conf class def ] that a conformal class is equivalent to a choice of @xmath288 for all @xmath289 .",
    "then the edge lengths within this conformal class are given by @xmath290l_{ij}$ ] for @xmath42 .",
    "we begin by supposing that all conformal classes on @xmath109 admit a cyclic length metric , @xmath29 .",
    "choose a vertex @xmath205 and label the remaining vertices @xmath291 proceeding clockwise around @xmath110 .",
    "recall that in a cyclic length metric @xmath292 @xmath293 now consider the conformal class such that @xmath288=1 for all @xmath289 , except for @xmath294 .",
    "equation  [ eq el 1 ] implies both that @xmath295 and @xmath296 . substituting this into the first equality in equation  [ eq el 2 ] shows that @xmath297 . the equality @xmath298 then yields @xmath299 but this implies that @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "equation  [ eq el 2 ] then gives @xmath302 , which contradicts our choice of @xmath303 .",
    "therefore this conformal class does not admit a cyclic length metric .",
    "one would like to know if there is some sort of generalization of a cyclic length metric that has constant scalar curvature and that occurs in all conformal classes .",
