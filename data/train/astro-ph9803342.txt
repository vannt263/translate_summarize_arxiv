    "in this paper , we report the results of an ultra - high - resolution ( 0.32 @xmath5 ) absorption line study of two stars , hd  141569 and hd  157841 .",
    "both stars were chosen as background sources for detailed spectroscopic studies of high galactic latitude molecular clouds ( hlcs ) , as well as gas in the nearby halo .",
    "hlcs show structure , with dense clumps as small as 0.03 pc , which appear to be virially unstable ( pound et al . 1990 ) .",
    "some of these clouds appear to be embedded in the local hot interstellar medium as suggested by the probable detection of x - ray shadowing from two mbm clouds ( burrows and mendenhall , 1991 ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it is not clear what physical process or combination of processes is causing such enhanced molecular abundances .",
    "this has led some authors ( blitz , 1990 ) to conclude that hlcs may represent a completely distinct population of clouds .",
    "more recent work by gir et al .",
    "( 1994 ) indicates that hlcs are almost always located along filamentary or looplike hi structures and appear to have condensed from atomic gas in situ rather than having been entrained in the hi .",
    "these clouds are an important factor both in the composition and the energy balance of the nearby interstellar medium .",
    "they have molecular masses about 50 m@xmath12 and the molecular gas contribution of these high latitude clouds in the solar neighborhood up to 100 pc , is about 5000 m@xmath12 ( magnani 1993 ) .",
    "the relation and exchange of energy between the molecular gas in these clouds and the ambient highly ionized , moderately ionized and atomic gas is unclear although it has been suggested by blitz ( 1990 ) that compression of these clouds could lead to a phase transition of atomic hydrogen into molecular hydrogen .",
    "absorption line studies toward stars whose lines of sight intercept regions close to hlcs , probe the diffuse component of the ism associated with these high latitude clouds .",
    "typical values of the kinetic temperatures for the diffuse component of the ism range between 45 to 130 k ( savage et al . 1977 ) . to resolve absorption lines arising from clouds with cloud kinetic temperatures of @xmath13  = 50 k , a velocity resolution of 0.30 @xmath5",
    "corresponding to a resolving power r = 10@xmath14 is necessary .",
    "the ultra high resolution facility ( uhrf ) at the anglo australian telescope ( aat ) is currently the world s highest - resolution optical astronomical spectrograph ( diego et al . , 1995 , barlow et al . , 1995 ) and",
    "is ideal for studies of such cool , interstellar clouds .    we have begun a study of the spatial distribution and properties of atomic and molecular interstellar species towards hlcs at ultra high resolution ( velocity resolution = 0.32 @xmath5  ) , and have compiled a list of background stars with reliable photometric and spectroscopic data and lying in the line of sight to hlcs .",
    "we have already observed a small fraction of this sample , utilizing the uhrf ( blades et al .",
    "1997 ) , and in the following sections , we present uhrf observations toward hd  141569 and hd  157841 .",
    "hd  141569 has been variously classified as an isolated herbig ae / be star ( th@xmath15 et al .",
    "1994 ) and a b9.5v star by penprase ( 1992 ) and an aove star by dunkin et al .",
    "it is an emission - line star associated with an iras source , iras  15473 - 0346 , which is not exactly coincident with it .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of the star is 6.4",
    "@xmath5  ( frisch , 1987 ) . in the direction of hd  141569 , which is located in galactic coordinates at ( @xmath16 , @xmath4 ) = ( 4.@xmath172 , + 36.@xmath179 )",
    ", this translates into a lsr radial velocity of 20.1 @xmath5  .",
    "the star exhibits excess far - ir emission ( oudmaijer et al .",
    "1992 ) believed to arise due to emission from dust grains present in a circumstellar disk , and sylvester et al .",
    "( 1996 ) include it in their list of vega - like systems .",
    "a high galactic latitude dark cloud complex at ( @xmath16 , @xmath4 ) @xmath11 ( 4@xmath17 , 36@xmath17 ) lies close to the star in projection .",
    "this cloud complex includes the lynds dark clouds l  134 , l  183 ( which is also often referred to as l  134n ; henceforth we will refer to this cloud as l  134n ) and l  1780 .",
    "the dense molecular co core mbm  36 is located within l  134 , while the co core in l  134n is referred to as mbm  37 ( magnani et al . 1985 ) .",
    "of these two dark clouds , l  134n , centered at ( @xmath16 , @xmath4 ) = ( 6@xmath17.0 , 36@xmath17.8 ) and 2@xmath17 north of l  134 , lies closest to hd  141569 .",
    "hd  141569 lies well within the 100@xmath3 m emission contours of the l  134n dark cloud ( laureijs et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "penprase ( 1992 ) estimated a distance of 190@xmath18110 pc for hd  141569 based on spectroscopic and ubv and strmgren photometric data .",
    "there are various distance estimates to the l134 , l134n and l1780 complex : 100@xmath1850 pc , based on optical extinction and surface brightness observations by mattila ( 1979 ) , 110@xmath1810 pc based on photometric data by franco ( 1989 ) and 160 pc based on reddenings of a large number of stars in this direction by snell ( 1981 ) .",
    "the parallax of hd  141569 from the hipparcos catalogue is 10.10@xmath180.83  mas , corresponding to a distance of 99@xmath188  pc .",
    "this implies that the distance to the star is very similar to that of the l  134 , l  134n and l  1780 complex .",
    "penprase ( 1992 ) estimated an e(b  v ) of 0.12 @xmath18 0.09 for hd  141569 .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue lists tycho magnitudes which transform to give ( b  v ) = 0.078@xmath180.007 , which for an a0v star corresponds to an e(b  v ) of 0.10@xmath180.03 ( the uncertainty of 0.03 is due to the uncertainty in the ( b  v)@xmath19 calibration for dwarf stars ) .",
    "the star falls just outside the outermost co contours which trace mbm  37 , the co core in l  134n ( caillault et al . 1995 ) .",
    "based on available information , although hd  141569 appears to lie approximately at the distance of l134n and clearly does not lie within the dark cloud itself , it is not certain whether it lies in front of , or behind this dark cloud .",
    "this point is discussed further in @xmath20 3.1.3 . and",
    "our uhrf data indicate that hd  141569 lies beyond l  134n and mbm  37 .",
    "hd  157841 , a b9 star ( simbad database ) at ( @xmath16 , @xmath4 ) = ( 16@xmath17.8 , 15@xmath17.7 ) , lies in projection near the hlc , mbm  151 , which is located at ( @xmath16 , @xmath4 ) = ( 21@xmath17.5 , 20@xmath17.9 ) .",
    "we have searched the simbad database and related literature and have been unable to find any radial velocity measurement for this star .",
    "+ based on co velocity agreement , penprase ( 1993 ) suggested that mbm  57 located at ( @xmath16 , @xmath4 ) = ( 5@xmath17.1 , 30@xmath17.8 ) is related to mbm  151 , which is @xmath11 19@xmath17 away .",
    "photometric data of stars in the region around mbm  57 ( franco , 1989 ) , show an increase in extinction beyond 100 pc .",
    "penprase ( 1992 ) also observed this increase in the reddening and estimated a distance of 150 to 210 pc for the near edge of mbm  57 . assuming that mbm  57 and mbm  151 are related , the distance to mbm  151 is @xmath11 200 pc",
    ". the co ( j= 1@xmath210 ) lsr velocity of mbm  151 is 0.8 @xmath5  ( magnani et al . , 1985 ) .",
    "the region near hd  157841 has not been mapped in co and it is not known if there is any co emission present at the position of the star or in its vicinity . the hipparcos catalogue lists a parallax for hd  157841 of 5.70@xmath181.16",
    "mas corresponding to a distance of 175@xmath18@xmath22  pc .",
    "it also lists tycho magnitudes which transform to yield ( b  v ) = 0.213@xmath180.008 . for a b9v star ,",
    "this corresponds to an e(b  v ) of 0.28@xmath180.03 . in @xmath20 3.2.5 .",
    ", we identify the various components seen in the uhrf spectra toward hd  157841 .",
    "the spectra of hd  141569 and hd  157841 were obtained during april 25 to 28 , 1994 and july 14 and 15 , 1995 , using the uhrf at the coud focus of the 3.9-meter anglo - australian telescope . for details about the uhrf refer to diego et al .",
    "the configuration of the spectrograph was set to give close to the highest achievable resolution which is r = 938,000 @xmath18 15,000 .",
    "we used the 35-slice image slicer ( diego , 1993 ) at the entrance aperture .",
    "we masked the image slicer down to give 18 slices on the detector which allowed for the simultaneous detection of the inter - order background on either side of the stellar spectrum .",
    "the detector was a tektronics ccd ( 1024 @xmath7 1024 ) with a pixel size of 24 @xmath7 24 @xmath3 m .",
    "the width of each individual slice produced by the image slicer is about 30 pixels , and the 18 slices filled over half the detector format while the order background filled the remainder .",
    "the entire ccd was read out with eight times binning in the direction perpendicular to the dispersion .",
    "the instrumental set - up gave a wavelength coverage of 2.5 , requiring separate exposures for each of the na  i d lines .",
    "individual exposures were normally 1800 seconds , and the total integration times were 30 minutes each for the d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 spectra , 60 minutes for ca  ii k and 180 minutes each for the k  i and ch spectra .",
    "comparison exposures using a th - ar lamp were used to establish the wavelength scale and showed that the plate scale is linear with wavelength over the 2.5  coverage ( barlow et al.1995 ) .",
    "measurements of the 6328.160   stabilized he - ne laser line taken during the observing run confirmed that we achieved a resolution of 0.32 @xmath5(fwhm ) .",
    "standard iraf reduction packages were used to combine individual integrations after cosmic ray events and the inter - order background had been removed .",
    "a scattered light correction of 3.5% was applied to all the data , derived from observations of a highly saturated d line in a different star ( hd  24263 ) recorded during the same period .",
    "the scattered - light fraction for the ca  ii , ch and k  i lines is not the same as for the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines .",
    "in particular for the ca  ii k line , inspite of background subtraction ( by taking averages of the inter - order regions above and below the stellar spectrum ) , there may still be a residual of as much as 10% ( crawford et al . 1994 ) .",
    "we do not have observations of saturated ca  ii k lines as in the case of the na  i d lines and therefore do not have exact values for the scattered light fraction in the ca  ii line .",
    "however , we have compared our total equivalent widths with the values published by penprase ( 1993 ) , assuming that the penprase data has no scattered light contribution .",
    "the equivalent widths obtained for na  i and ch for both hd  141569 and hd  157841 are consistent with zero contribution from scattered light . for the case of the ca",
    "ii line , we estimate the contribution of scattered light to the measured equivalent widths to be @xmath11 15% for hd  141569 and @xmath11 8% for hd  157841 . for the case of the k  i lines ,",
    "we are not able to make such scattered light estimates since there are no published k  i equivalent widths for either star .",
    "we have not subtracted this correction for the ca  ii lines and estimate that the uncertainty due to scattered light has a small effect on the derived column densities ( @xmath23 10% ) and has almost no effect on the measured linewidths , which is our main concern in this paper .",
    "the spectra were normalized by fits of straight lines to sections without telluric or interstellar absorption .",
    "telluric absorptions around the d line region were removed by dividing by a uhrf telluric template spectrum of @xmath24  eri , which was rescaled so that the depth of individual telluric features matched those of unblended telluric lines in the spectra .",
    "rest wavelengths in air of 5895.9234  for d@xmath1 , 5889.9512  for d@xmath2 , 3933.663     for ca  ii k , 7698.974    for k  i and 4300.3133    for ch , were adopted from morton ( 1991 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios derived from the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation in the stellar continuum for hd  141569 are 20 for d@xmath1 , 28 for d@xmath2 and 10 for the ca  ii k , ch and k  i spectra . in the case of hd  157841 , the s / n values are 35 for d@xmath1 , 16 for d@xmath2 , 10 for k  i , 20 for ca  ii k and 42 for ch .",
    "we used the method of profile fitting developed by welty et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to derive the properties of the individual interstellar clouds .",
    "the essential assumptions are that each cloud is homogeneous and can be described by a column density @xmath25 , radial velocity @xmath26 , and a gaussian line of sight velocity dispersion characterized by the line width parameter @xmath4  =  ( 2k@xmath13/m  +  2@xmath27)@xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the r.m.s ( gaussian ) turbulent velocity along the line of sight .",
    "the intrinsic line profiles were calculated assuming a minimum number of velocity components and were then convolved with the instrumental response .",
    "the three parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath4 ) for each cloud were then determined by an iterative , nonlinear , least - square fit to the observed profile .",
    "the parameters were fine - tuned until a satisfactory fit was achieved .",
    "the main criterion of a satisfactory fit is that the r.m.s .",
    "deviation ( @xmath30 ) from the observed fit is comparable to the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation in the stellar continuum .",
    "the uncertainties were determined by varying one parameter while keeping others unchanged until the residual between the fit and observed profile goes beyond 3@xmath30 of the stellar continuum .",
    "+ for both hd  141569 and hd  157841 , we started with the k  i profile . to provide a good fit , one component was required for hd  141569 and two components for hd  157841 .",
    "we started with the components determined from the k  i fitting and added more components to generate good fits for the other lines . for the case of the ca  ii",
    "k profile , the prominent features coincide with the components seen in k  i but we needed to include additional components for both hd  141569 and hd  157841 to generate good fits . in the case of hd  157841 for example ,",
    "only one of the k  i components coincides with the ca  ii k components and we needed a minimum of 5 more components to achieve a good fit .",
    "for the na d@xmath1 line , the central part is saturated for both stars but in the case of hd  157841 for example , the four components derived from the ca  ii k fitting , were sufficient to obtain a satisfactory fit .",
    "the theoretical profile was calculated using the same parameters for the na d@xmath2 line and a satisfactory fit was obtained , confirming the choice of @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath4 parameters used in the na d@xmath1 fit .",
    "the ch r@xmath31 ( 1 ) line is split due to @xmath32-doubling in the @xmath33@xmath34 ground state of the molecule , with the two components being separated by 1.43 @xmath5   ( black & van dishoeck , 1988 ) .",
    "the two @xmath32 doublet components have equal strength which results in a symmetric absorption - line profile in the absence of additional unresolved velocity structure .",
    "the ch line is weak toward both stars and the s / n ratios of the spectra are probably not enough to clearly see this splitting .",
    "the slight asymmetry of the profiles suggests the possible presence of unresolved cloud structure .",
    "we have however used only one component to fit the ch profile for each of the stars .",

    "@xmath5  of our observations , the @xmath4 values derived for the 5 components ( listed in table 1 ) , is greater than 1.45 @xmath5  .",
    "welty et al . ( 1994 ) made a high resolution survey of interstellar na  i d@xmath1 lines towards 38 stars .",

    "hence there is the possiblity that the @xmath4 values reported in our paper are overestimates of the true @xmath4 values of individual clouds , caused by our inability to resolve the component structure due to the relatively low s /",
    "n of our spectra .",
    "however , on the other hand , our earlier uhrf observations on the hd  28497 sightline ( blades et al .",
    "1997 ) have s / n comparable to the s / n of the spectra presented here . in the case of hd  28497 , four of the 15 components detected in na  i had @xmath4 values ranging between 0.31 to 0.40 @xmath5  while we do not detect any component toward hd  141569 ( or",

    "the minimum detectable column density for na  i in the spectra presented in this paper is @xmath11 2 @xmath7 10@xmath52 @xmath48 which is about a factor 100 less than the column densities of the typical interstellar clouds studied by welty et al .",
    "one possiblity is that the large @xmath4 value components seen toward hd  141569 ( and hd  157841 ) are a superposition of several low column density ( @xmath51 2 @xmath7 10@xmath53 @xmath48 ) clouds , with overlapping velocities .",
    "these are not the typical interstellar clouds described by welty et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and it is unlikely that all the components seen in our spectra are due to such overlapping low column density clouds . for this reason , we conclude that the @xmath4 values we estimate in this paper probably reflect the true @xmath4 values of the individual clouds .",
    "seen in absorption only in ca  ii k , this weak component is relatively broad with @xmath4 = 4.5 @xmath5  .",
    "no h  i counterpart to this component is seen at position 5 .",
