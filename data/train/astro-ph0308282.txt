    "clusters of galaxies are formed in violent events , cluster mergers .",
    "these mergers can dramatically affect the observed properties of clusters , particularly in the x - ray band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "signatures of mergers include `` cold fronts '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , merger shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and multiple cool cores @xcite . the application of simple hydrodynamical analysis to these merger signatures allows the merger mach number and other aspects of the merger kinematics to be determined ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "merger mach numbers are modest , @xmath0 .",
    "mergers also provide interesting tests of the role of various physics processes in clusters .",
    "for example , very strong limits have been placed on the rate of thermal conduction and diffusion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities and viscosity @xcite .",
    "they also provide limits on the relative roles of thermal versus nonthermal pressure sources in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "the role of merger shocks in accelerating relativistic particles can also be studied @xcite .",
    "recently , the relative distributions of gas , galaxies , and dark matter in merging clusters have been used to limit the self - collisional cross - section of the dark matter @xcite ; collisional dark matter has been suggested to explain the mass profiles in dwarf galaxies and to resolve other problems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , merger effects can complicate the use of clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes .",
    "clusters provide a number of important cosmological tests , mainly because they are the only objects which are large enough to represent a fair sample of materials in the universe , yet small enough to be relaxed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most analyses of clusters for cosmology assume that they are equilibrium systems ; for example , the masses of clusters are often determined from hydrostatic equilibrium , or more simply by assuming an equilibrium relation between the cluster x - ray temperature or luminosity and the cluster mass . during major mergers ,",
    "clusters are not in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "also , compression and heating during a merger can produce a large transient increase in the x - ray temperature and luminosity @xcite .",
    "if equilibrium relations are applied to merging clusters , their masses can be greatly over - estimated @xcite",
    ". this can be particularly important for high redshift clusters ; in flux limited samples , merging clusters can be over represented due to their boosted x - ray luminosities .",
    "it is important to understand these effects by studying relatively nearby clusters where more detailed dynamical information can be determined .    in this paper , we present new _ xmm - newton _  observations of the abell 1644 cluster .",
    "our analysis of the _ einstein _",
    "observation suggested that this cluster was undergoing a major merger .",
    "@xcite classified a1644 as a double cluster with roughly equal components based on the _ einstein _  image . from a deprojection analysis of the _ einstein _  data , @xcite found that a1644 harbors a small cooling flow of about 12 solar masses per year .",
    "@xcite noted the possible presence of two components in the galaxy velocity distribution in the cluster , and listed two subclusters as part of this cluster .",
    "they also found that the cd galaxy had a large peculiar velocity , which suggests the possible presence of minor substructure .",
    "however , in the end they classified abell 1644 as a regular cluster .",
    "no evidence for substructure has been found in recent optical and near - infrared observations by @xcite .",
    "a1644 is located close to a region of high galaxy cluster density .",
    "it is about 15degrees north ( in galactic coordinates ) of the core of the shapley supercluster ( fig .",
    "[ i2mass ] ) at about the same redshift , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ , with its combination of high throughput , broad spectral band , good spectral resolution , and fairly large field of view is ideal for studying this merging system .",
    "a1644 was observed by _ xmm - newton _  for a total duration of 23ks during revolution 199 ( observation i",
    "d : 0010420201 ) on january 8 , 2001 .",
    "the epic - mos cameras were operated in full frame ( ff ) mode and the epic - pn camera in extended full frame ( eff ) mode .",
    "the thin1 filter was used in all epic observations for protection against optical light contamination .",
    "calibrated event files have been created with .",
    "the calibration index file has been created on may 7 , 2002 based on the most up to date calibration files available at that time .",
    "most further reduction and analysis steps have been performed using sas v5.3 and the package .",
    "_ xmm - newton _  observations in general suffer from periods of very high background similar to _ chandra _  observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are several possible ways to ` clean ' a data set of these flares .",
    "our method is based on the fact that we will use independent blank - sky observations (   [ backg ] ) to determine the main non - flare hard background component , the ` particle induced background ' ( pib ) .",
    "( the pib is distinct from the flares , which are believed to be produced by ` soft ' protons . )",
    "thus , we must be able to clean the blank - sky background observations in the same way as the source observation . when determining the lightcurve this requires ensuring a negligible ` contamination ' by emission from astrophysical sources because otherwise the sensitivity to flare detection varies between source and background observation .",
    "here we choose for the mos cameras the energy band 1012kev and for pn the band 1214kev similar to previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are dominated by pib ( background induced directly or through fluorescent instrumental lines by high energy particles ) and soft protons ( if present ) . note that this approach has the drawback of low statistics and furthermore assumes that the flare characteristics in this energy band are representative of those at lower energies as well . in   [ backg ]",
    "we test the effect of increased statistics and the latter assumption .",
    "times were binned in 100s intervals , which appears to be a reasonable compromise between good temporal resolution and low noise level .",
    "this time interval also is large compared to the read out cycles of the cameras .",
    "further only events with pattern @xmath2 12 and flag = 0 have been used to ensure a high rejection of potentially distorting events such as caused by hot / flickering pixels / columns or features close to ccd edges especially at the read out nodes .",
    "inspection of the resulting lightcurves showed no obvious flares in the pn data ( fig .",
    "[ lcpn ] ) .",
    "mos count rates were higher by up to a factor @xmath3 4 in the beginning of the mos observations compared to the remaining times ( fig .",
    "[ lcmos ] ) .",
    "mos exposures started earlier than those for the pn camera ; the lack of obvious flares in pn is consistent with the mos lightcurves for the overlapping time interval .",
    "the obviously contaminated times in the mos observations were removed by taking into account only events with arrival times @xmath4 95360200s ( _ xmm - newton _  time ) for all further steps .    before calculating mean count rates in order to test for background flares , conservative ` generic ' cuts have been applied on the count rates , @xmath5 . for pn ( mos ) only times with @xmath6 counts per 100s have been used .",
    "the lower threshold is especially important for pn data in order not to bias the calculation of the mean count rate by inclusion of counting mode times , times during which transmission of information for individual events of one or more ( most likely all four ) quadrants to the ground station does not occur .    for the final cuts , upper _ and _ lower thresholds",
    "are required in order to treat statistical fluctuations in both directions symmetrically . here",
    "we choose to define the good time intervals ( gtis ) by including only times where the count rates lie within @xmath7 2@xmath8 of the mean count rates .",
    "for the individual detectors the count rate limits for gtis are found to be 825 ( pn ) , 315 ( mos1 ) , and 215 ( mos2 ) counts per 100s .",
    "the effective exposure time ( live time ) after this procedure results in 11ks for pn and 13ks for mos1 and mos2 .",
    "depending on the nature of a detected event one should take into account vignetting caused by the baffles , mirrors , reflection grating array ( for the mos cameras only ) , etc .  in the analysis .",
    "for instance the x - ray photons from the target source ( a1644 ) and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) are vignetted in the same way .",
    "the soft protons show a different vignetting characteristic ( but hopefully we got rid of most of those in   [ flare ] ) and",
    "the pib is not vignetted at all if the spatial variation of the fluorescent lines caused by the camera material itself is not interpreted as a vignetting characteristic .",
    "the noise in the ccds , most easily visible as low energy events close to the ccd edges , is not vignetted , either .    in general , however , it s not easily possible to determine the nature of an individual event .",
    "the combination of methods for flare rejection , vignetting correction and background subtraction employed here aims at a proper treatment of all components for the spectral analysis .",
    "this strategy involves correcting _ all _ events for the vignetting expected for x - ray photons regardless of their nature at this point .",
    "the vignetting depends on detector position and energy .",
    "the vignetting correction has been accomplished with the sas task evigweight which adds a weight column to the events file .",
    "the value of the weight is determined for each event by taking into account the detector position and energy of the event .",
    "weights are assigned relative to the on - axis effective area so the weights have values @xmath4 1 . to accumulate images and spectra these weights",
    "are summed up , and errors are propagated including the vignetting correction .      in general , proper background subtraction is vital for an accurate spectral analysis of extended sources . in our case , the cluster emission fills most of the fields - of - view of the detectors , so it is difficult to determine the background from our observations .",
    "thus , we determine the background from so called blank - sky observations .",
    "the blank - sky observations are mostly high galactic latitude observations of regions with very few bright sources .",
    "several such observations have been combined for the epic cameras mostly for the thin filter in ( mostly ) ff mode @xcite to achieve good statistics and reduce the effects of cosmic / sample variance .",
    "we have made sure that for the energy range and signal - to - noise ratio in spectral fits here , the differences in charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) corrections between the pn ff and eff mode are not significant .",
    "the blank - sky observations are available at the _ xmm - newton _  calibration web page .",
    "the background observations have been recast on the sky in order to match the source observations using the sas task attcalc .",
    "this allows using sky coordinates for regional selections and at the same time estimating the background from the same detector regions as the source , which in turn ensures that the significant variation of the fluorescent line emission with detector position is properly taken into account . by treating the blank - sky backgrounds identically to the data ,",
    "the effect of incorrectly applying a vignetting correction to the pib ( in the source _ and _ background observations ) is removed .",
    "the same flare rejection method (   [ flare ] ) has been applied to the background observations .",
    "the count rate limits for gtis here are found to be 831 ( pn ) and 216 ( mos1 and mos2 ) counts per 100s .",
    "the pib shows variation of about 8% ( 1@xmath8 ) as well as a long term decrease of about 20% between the beginning of _ xmm - newton _  observations and january 2001 @xcite . in order to account for these variations , total field - of - view count rates of source and background observations",
    "have been calculated using the same energy , pattern , and flag selection criteria as for the gti determination (   [ flare ] ) .",
    "the source to background count rate ratios @xmath9 ( mos1 ) , @xmath10 ( mos2 ) , and @xmath11 ( pn ) have been found ( 1@xmath8 errors ) , consistent with the expected variation . for the calculation of these pib scaling factors the events",
    "have not been corrected for vignetting .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ flare ] , cleaning of flares in the high energy bands generally used does not necessarily imply that all flares have been removed .",
    "actually , we did find some weak remnant flares in the blank - sky observations when plotting lightcurves ( gti screened as described in   [ flare ] ) in broad energy bands ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore tested the variation in ( 1012kev ) source to background count rate ratios when calculating gtis in the energy bands 712 and 0.312kev for mos1 and mos2 .",
    "we found that the variation is less than the ( 1@xmath8 ) statistical uncertainty and conclude that the influence of remnant flares is negligible for calculation of background scaling factors here .    to check whether the limitation to high energy bands for the calculation of background scaling factors affects the results",
    "significantly we have calculated them also using the energy ranges 0.314kev ( pn ) and 0.312kev ( mos ) . in this case , of course , only the ccd parts shielded from x - ray photons ( and soft protons ) are usable .",
    "we found results consistent with the total field - of - view results for pn and mos1 and a slightly larger value for mos2 ( @xmath12 ) . in order to exclude the possibility that an imperfect correlation between the normalization of the continuum and the fluorescence lines ( dependent on detector position ) for the pib caused this slightly larger than expected variation , we also used the energy range 27kev to calculate the background scaling factors .",
    "the results were consistent with the broader energy range used previously .    in summary",
    ", following these tests the background scaling factors 0.96 ( mos ) and 0.88 ( pn ) have been assigned to the observations .",
    "most of the tests above yield results consistent with the expected statistical uncertainties . to account for the difference between mos and pn scaling factors",
    "a conservative 8% systematic error has been added to the full energy range of all background spectra .",
    "note also that it is implicitly assumed here ( and in most other works that follow similar procedures ) that the spectrum of the pib does not vary when its normalization changes .",
    "currently , there seems to be no strong evidence for significant spectral variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) apart from the fluorescence lines .",
    "the main drawback of this method is that in general one gets the background contribution from the cxb wrong .",
    "the pib dominates the hard part of the total background but the cxb is important for the lower energies . ideally one would estimate the difference in cxb contribution to source and background observations from a region with negligible source emission in the source observation or another observation very close by ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is not feasible in the case of a1644 since cluster emission fills the entire field of view and the only other _ xmm - newton _  observation within 5 degrees to date is likewise filled entirely with ngc  5044 s emission . here",
    ", we model a possible cxb difference in the spectral fitting procedure .    in order to estimate the spectral shape of a possible cxb difference between the source and background spectra we have extracted spectra from an irregular region with decreased cluster emission in the north - western part of the observation and fitted a two temperature model .",
    "a high temperature component which is supposed to account for the cluster emission and a low temperature , zero redshift , solar abundance component which should represent the cxb excess relative to the background observations .",
    "the model fits indicate that in this region the cluster emission still dominates .",
    "the ratio of the number of cluster photons to cxb photons equals about 4 in the energy range 0.310kev and about 2 in the energy range 0.30.5kev . a best fit value @xmath13kev is found for the low temperature component .",
    "this estimate is consistent with values from studies of soft excess emission in other clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of this component is uncertain ; @xcite argue that it is due to intergalactic gas located around clusters .",
    "our aim here is not to try to discuss the source of this soft cxb excess , but rather to determine its contribution to the cluster emission and account for it in the model fits (   [ spect ] ) .",
    "spectra from mos1 , mos2 , pn have been fit simultaneously . the same pattern and flag selections have been applied as for the generation of gtis , except that only single and double events have been used for the pn camera .",
    "the response matrices were m11_r7_im_all_2000 - 11 - 09.rmf , m21_r7_im_all_2000 - 11 - 09.rmf , and epn_ef2 + 0_sdy9.rmf for mos1 , mos2 , and pn respectively , in addition to on - axis ancillary response files created with the sas task arfgen .",
    "a comparison of individual pn single and double event spectral fits gives consistent results .",
    "the response of the pn camera depends on detector position .",
    "however , it has been verified that for the accuracy needed here , use of the epn_ef20_sdy0.rmf response matrix does not result in significant changes of best fit parameter values .",
    "individual fit results from the three cameras are consistent with each other .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ s point spread function ( psf ) is much improved compared to the psfs of previous satellites capable of spatially resolved spectroscopy , e.g. , _",
    "asca_. nevertheless , for objects with strong temperature and surface brightness gradients its effect can become important .",
    "however , the main emphasis in this work is on the comparison of different segments of spectra at the same radii from cluster centers . in this case",
    "radial psf effects should not cause any artificial differences .",
    "spectral fits have been performed within xspec  using a model ( wabs*mekal)+mekal .",

    "the overall flux from a1644 , which extends beyond _ xmm - newton _ s field - of - view , is @xmath81 @xcite based on rass  data .",
    "( a1644 was not observed in pointed mode with the ps . . )",
    "it is worth noting that a1644 has been treated as a single cluster in the hiflugcs@xcite and reflex @xcite catalogs , primarily due to the limited exposure time ( @xmath82 300s ) of the rass  at a1644 s position and the relatively small projected separation of the two cluster components .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  image indicates that the x - ray flux ( @xmath83 ) ratio between the main and sub clump is about 3:1 .",
    "this means instead of one cluster with @xmath84 one actually has two clusters with about @xmath85 and @xmath86 each .",
    "this could affect luminosity and mass functions significantly if such major mergers were common .",
    "the effect of an incorrect treatment would be to artificially increase the number of high mass clusters and decrease the number of low mass clusters . using the shape of the mass function to constrain the cosmic mass density , @xmath87 , and the amplitude of mass fluctuations ,",
    "expressed as @xmath88 , individually would then result in artificially low values for @xmath87 and high values for @xmath88 . with the ongoing analysis of the complete sample of hiflugcs  clusters with _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton _ , we will be able to quantify the fraction of such clusters and their influence on derived cosmological parameters , as well as to study the difficulty of estimating survey selection functions in the vicinity of bright clusters ( not only due to double clusters but also line of sight projections ) in general .",
    "a simple broad beam temperature estimate may be biased low compared to the ambient gas temperature due to cool emission in the dense ( high emissivity ) cores .",
    "for instance , the temperature in a large annulus around the main clump in a1644 ( 201325@xmath89 ) is 4.40kev . if we take this as the ambient temperature which is characteristic of the cluster gravitational potential , it is a factor of 1.15 higher than a broad beam temperature estimate including both clumps ( 3.83kev ) .",
    "since @xmath90 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this factor translates into an underestimate of a factor of 1.231.32 in the cluster mass .",
    "the surface brightness structure of both sub clumps is obviously messy .",
    "however , the radial temperature profiles ( figs .  [ tprofm ] and [ tprofs ] ) are smooth and appear rather similar to profiles of relaxed clusters ( e.g. , compare to fig .  1 in * ? ?",
    "this might suggest that a1644 is moderately relaxed , and that the temperature structure may not be strongly affected by the interaction of the two sub clumps .",
    "however , a more detailed examination of the thermal structure shows that the cluster is not at all relaxed . as the hr map ( fig .  [ hr ] ) indicates and figs .",
    "[ tregm ] and [ tregs ] confirm , the temperature structure is also quite complex .",
    "the region between the two clumps is significantly hotter than the region to the west of the main clump ( the region which appears least disturbed in x - ray surface brightness ) .",
    "this may indicate that the gas in the region between the clumps has been heated up by adiabatic compression or shocks .",
    "also , the core - within - a - core structure of the main clump ( fig .  [ ixmm ] ) may be caused by core oscillations induced by the passage of the sub clump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or possibly by a remnant of a previous merger .",
    "furthermore , both the surface brightness and temperature structure around the sub clump are peculiar . based on the x - ray image",
    ", the gas appears to be slightly compressed to the north and clearly elongated to the south and west .",
    "this suggests that this sub clump is moving through the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the main clump , and losing some fraction of its gas in a trail behind the core of the sub clump .",
    "given this dynamical picture what temperature structure might be expected ?",
    "one may expect heated gas in front of the sub clump ( projected roughly to the north ) due to adiabatic compression or shocks .",
    "one might also expect the trail to the south to consist of somewhat cooler , more metal - rich gas stripped from the sub clump .",
    "this appears to be consistent both with the hr map and with the extracted spectra in the sub clump regions r1 , r3 , and r5 .",
    "[ iopt ] and [ irad2 ] show that the x - ray peak of the sub clump and the optical center of the brightest galaxy coincide .",
    "this suggests that the sub clump has not passed through the core of the main clump ; if it had , the very high ram pressure would have stripped the sub clump core , which would lag behind the collisionless dark matter and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the angle of the cool , metal - rich gas trail also suggests an off - center collision .",
    "one concern with this picture is that the dense gas in the core of the sub clump would then be interacting with lower density gas in the outer parts of the main clump .",
    "would one expect the dense sub cluster to lose an observable amount of gas during its travel through the icm ?",
    "we have compared a1644 to a hydrodynamical simulation of a small cluster undergoing an off - axis merger with a larger cluster .",
    "this simulation was done completely independently ; no effort was made to adjust the initial conditions to match the observation of a1644 .",

    "there is hotter gas in front of the smaller cluster and cooler , ram - pressure stripped gas behind .",
    "this trail of stripped gas cools adiabatically as it expands .",
    "there is a hotter region to the southwest , which is similar to region r4 seen in a1644 .",
    "the larger scale @xmath91 distribution around the main cluster in the simulation is also similar to that observed in a1644 .",
    "there appears to be slightly cooler gas to the southeast in the simulation due to stripped gas from the smaller cluster , which agrees with the r8 region in the hr map and spectra .    the indication for an increased metal abundance in the cool trail of a1644 s sub clump makes other scenarios like cooling of intracluster gas onto the moving sub clump ( as seen in a1795 on much smaller scales , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) more difficult to reconcile with the data .",
    "note that the radio source in the center of the sub clump ( fig .",

    "the x - ray analysis is also supported by optical data on the cluster , and the resulting dynamical picture agrees very well with an independent hydrodynamical simulation of such an off - axis merger .",
    "the findings imply that we see gas that has been removed from the smaller sub cluster possibly by ram pressure from the motion through intracluster gas of the main clump , possibly augmented by the effect of the central radio source of this sub clump .    the code to create the x - ray temperature map made use of the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ; @xcite ) .",
