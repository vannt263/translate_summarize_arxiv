    "as is well known , the inflationary paradigm provides solutions to many cosmological problems such as the flatness problem , the horizon or causality problem , and also dilutes unwanted ( and unobserved ) relics @xcite .",
    "it also provides a natural mechanism of producing primordial perturbations that seed the inhomogeneities of the universe @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the quantum fluctuations of a classically homogeneous scalar field , the inflaton , source quantum fluctuations of the spacetime metric ( the inflaton will create density perturbations which will source the scalar fluctuations of the metric ) . during the process of inflation , this quantum fluctuation is amplified to become a classical fluctuation , and , at the end of inflation , the fluctuation in the metric induces the density fluctuations of matter that were produced during reheating .",
    "this primordial perturbation generated during inflation then is what gives rise to the formation of structure in the universe .    in this story ,",
    "the crucial quantities to be determined are the amplitude of the primordial density and tensor perturbations , as the growth of structure is dependent on their size .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the primordial perturbations can be inferred from careful observations of the history of the growth of structure . from this",
    "we expect that the density perturbation produced by inflation to be @xmath2 .    therefore , it is important to be able to accurately compute these perturbations in order to either preserve or rule out a given inflationary model .",
    "for the usual models of inflation , ricci scalar plus a single canonically normalized scalar field , there are two components that will determine this amplitude .",
    "as will be described in more detail below , the first is the form of a function , @xmath0 , which arises in the mukhanov - sasaki equation .",
    "this equation is satisfied by a mode function , @xmath3 , which arises by a redefinition of the co - moving curvature perturbation in momentum space , @xmath4 , upon having written the original action in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "since this equation is crucial to finding the curvature perturbation ( the same equation is also obeyed by the tensor modes ) , it is essential that one accurately specifies its form .",
    "the second component is the input from vacuum selection , which is equivalent to a boundary condition for the mukhanov - sasaki equation .",
    "for example , one avenue of study has been to alter the initial state to lie away from the standard bunch - davies vacuum@xcite .",
    "such alternative boundary conditions are typically chosen by conditions set at a given cut - off scale in either momentum or time .",
    "these choices will then manifest themselves in physical observables ( for example as new features in the power spectrum , or enhanced non - gaussianity ) which can allow one to gain knowledge of the initial state from observation .",
    "it should be mentioned that there exist arguments @xcite that the bunch - davies vacuum might be the most probable vacuum to produce the correct power spectrum from the perspective of technical naturalness , although this does not eliminate the possibility of deviations from the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "it is customary to characterize inflation as a period of time where the scale factor grew almost exponentially , a period called de sitter or quasi - de sitter inflation ( exact exponential growth of the scale factor , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 constant , is technically de sitter inflation , and nearly exponential growth is termed quasi - de sitter ) .",
    "if the universe inflates as a power law manner @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conformal time and @xmath9 is a constant , than the solution of the mukahanov - sasaki equation is known .",
    "notice that de sitter inflation correspond to @xmath10 the solution for general @xmath9 is given by a linear combination of bessel functions .",
    "the calculation for the perturbation amplitude has been well established for such a case.@xcite however , for most models of inflation , power law expansion happens only in a short period of time either at the beginning or the end of the inflation .",
    "thus this commonly used approximation may not apply to all inflationary models .",
    "if one insists on using the equations derived from the power law limit , one runs the risk of possibly ruling out phenomenologically viable models , or of preserving models that are ruled out by observational data .    in the present work we would like to address the possibility that the function @xmath0 inside the mukhanov equation deviates from the de sitter limit , and how that may affect one s choice of boundary conditions .",
    "it may be that before some point @xmath11 that using the de sitter limit is not consistent , and therefore placing boundary conditions at @xmath11 is more natural .",
    "we have thus expanded the standard method of computing the amplitude of the primordial perturbation for such a case .",
    "our method applies to those inflationary models that do not behave with power law ( at least partially ) expansion with some specific constraints in the background evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[standardmethod ] we review the standard calculation of primordial density and tensor perturbations where the de sitter limit is taken .",
    "we also explain the physical reasons behind the commonly chosen bunch - davies vacuum . in sec.[vacuumselection ] we introduce a new method of vacuum selection by applying this method to a specific inflation model .",
    "the principles of generalizing this method to other models is also given . in sec.[conclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "we will now outline the key ingredients for the calculation of the primordial perturbations by quantizing the comoving curvature perturbation as well as the tensor perturbation @xcite ( for a recent textbook treatment and lecture notes see @xcite ) .",
    "the theories we consider here contain an einstein - hilbert action and a canonically normalized scalar field , minimally coupled to gravity with an arbitrary self - interacting potential @xmath12 where @xmath13 and our metric signature is @xmath14 .",
    "we begin with the perturbed friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) metric including the most general perturbations@xmath15 dx^{i}dx^{j}\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 are small perturbations around homogeneous frw metric .",
    "we will be concerned with calculating the scalar @xmath19 , which is the gauge invariant comoving curvature perturbation .",
    "variation of the action eq.([action ] ) gives the einstein equations and the scalar field equation of motion , which at the background level are@xmath20 \\label{00}\\\\ &   \\frac{a^{\\prime\\prime}}{a^{3}}-\\frac{\\left (   a^{\\prime}\\right )   ^{2}}{a^{4}}=-\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{3}\\left [   \\frac{1}{a^{2}}\\left (   \\sigma^{\\prime } \\right )   ^{2}-v\\left (   \\sigma\\right )   \\right ] \\label{11}\\\\ &   \\frac{\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime}}{a^{2}}+2\\frac{a^{\\prime}}{a^{3}}\\sigma ^{\\prime}+v^{\\prime}\\left (   \\sigma\\right )   = 0 \\label{eom sigma}\\ ] ] where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time , @xmath8 , while a dot will indicate a derivative with respect to the coordinate time , @xmath21 .",

    "the equation is analytically solvable . in this special case @xmath0",
    "can be written as@xmath45 and the analytic solution for @xmath46 is given in terms of bessel functions @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two complex parameters .",
    "a well known example for this special case is that of power law inflation , @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "one then obtains @xmath52 , which gives @xmath53 or @xmath54 and the comoving horizon @xmath55 .",
    "pure de sitter expansion is the specific case of @xmath56 . for genuine de sitter inflation , @xmath57 vanishes , which leads to an exactly scale - invariant power spectrum that is now observationally disfavored @xcite",
    "this implies that inflation must deviate from the pure de sitter case .",
    "the solutions to eq.@xmath58 can be written either as linear combinations of bessel functions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , or hankel functions , @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 the wronskian condition eq.@xmath64 requires @xmath65 when the solution is expressed in terms of hankel functions , there is a natural place where the boundary condition may be imposed , that is when @xmath66 , or equivalently when the comoving wavelength is deep inside the comoving hubble radius .",
    "the asymptotic forms of the hankel functions become positive and negative frequency modes @xmath67 the fact that in the far past the solution approaches those of minkowski space can be seen in the behavior of @xmath0 displayed in fig.@xmath68    [ zppzfit ]    the vanishing behavior of @xmath0 in this asymptotic region ensures that solutions to eq.@xmath58 reduce to the minkowski type in the far past .",
    "thus , for these classes of inflationary models there is a natural boundary condition that the solution should approach the positive frequency ougoing mode with no incoming modes @xmath69 this form is seen to match that of @xmath70 in eq.([hankel ] ) .",
    "the boundary condition eq.([bc ] ) is known as the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite .",
    "this has the effect of setting @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eq.([v2 ] ) .",
    "this appears as a natural choice , as one may think intuitively that at the beginning of time , all the particles ( or positive frequency modes ) should move forward in time , thus eliminating the possibility of having a contribution from the @xmath73 term .",
    "we would like to stress that although @xmath74 is a legitimate limit formally , but physically there will exist a time where the physical wavelength will be comparable to the planck length where quantum gravity effects should take place .",
    "this means in that region , the background evolution can no longer be treated classically . due to the lack of a full quantum gravity theory ,",
    "the boundary condition may be imposed at some later time where the physical wavelength is greater than the planck length .",
    "the effect of setting the boundary condition at a finite time may be that the state does not reside in the ground state , but rather in some squeezed or distorted state @xcite .    for general energy contents of the universe ,",
    "the form of the scale factor will no longer be a simple power - law ( although during times where a single component is the dominant contributor to the stress - energy such as during matter or radiation domination , the power - law form is a good approximation ) . as an approximation",
    ", a standard analytic approach is to assume the expansion is approximately de sitter , @xmath75 , and therefore @xmath76 . together with the smallness condition of the second slow - roll parameter @xmath77 using eq.@xmath78 one finds @xmath79 under this assumption , the solution of the mukhanov - sasaki equation is @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are two complex parameters with four degrees of freedom , one of which is fixed by eq.([normalize ] ) ,",
    "two more by eq.([bc ] ) , leaving one irrelevant phase undetermined . with these conditions",
    ", the solution for the mode function is @xmath83 this leads to the well known relations for the scalar power - spectrum , @xmath84 , the spectral index @xmath85 , and the running of the spectral index @xmath86 @xmath87 note that each relation is to be evaluated at horizon crossing , @xmath88 ( or equivalently @xmath89 ) , due to the fact that the perturbation is frozen when the comoving wavelength becomes stretched outside the comoving hubble radius .",
    "the accuracy of this program strongly depends on the quality of how well the approximation of the curve @xmath0 compares with the true function @xmath0 .",
    "applying these equations to models where @xmath0 is not well fit by the power law and slow - roll approximations may result in serious deviations from the observable predictions .",
    "this is precisely the problem we will address in section [ vacuum ] . before doing",
    "so we will first give an overview of quantization in the tensor sector .",
    "the calculation for tensor perturbations mirrors that of the scalar perturbation .",
    "the starting point is once again the perturbed frw metric with a transverse , traceless tensor perturbation , @xmath90 ( we have omitted the scalar and vector perturbations seen previously which has no effect on the tensor mode evolution due to decoupling of the scalar , vector , and tensor sectors ) @xmath91    next , one expands the einstein - hilbert action to second order in the perturbation @xmath92\\ ] ] as in the scalar case , one expands @xmath90 in fourier space in terms of plane waves with modes @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the spin - two polarization tensors .",
    "one can then make the definition @xmath96 which leads to the action ( here we have set @xmath97 ) @xmath98\\ ] ] this action gives similar equations of motion as eq.@xmath99 @xmath100 for a scale factor of the power - law form , the calculation follows exactly as in the scalar case while the fit function in terms of slow - roll parameter is now@xmath101    in the case of quasi de sitter inflation , @xmath76 , the power spectrum for a single polarization of the tensor modes toward the end of inflation is @xmath102 which differs from the form of the scalar result in that the slow - roll parameter @xmath26 is absent in the denominator .",
    "the full power spectrum is then twice this ( due to two polarization states ) @xmath103 , which leads to a small tensor to scalar ratio @xmath104 when the slow - roll parameter is small .",
    "these results for the power spectra are obtained under the assumption that the expansion is de sitter or very nearly de sitter in the sense that eq.([desitter ] ) is true . to obtain a more accurate predication",
    "one must solve the mukhanov equation on a model - by - model basis using the exact @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) numerically , along with choosing a proper boundary condition accordingly . in the next section",
    "we will institute such a procedure in order to quantize models where eq.@xmath105 is not a good approximation .",
    "[ vacuum ]    the mode equation one needs to solve is @xmath106 one can obtain the analytic expression for @xmath107 from solving the background equations . for the scalar case @xmath107",
    "is given by @xmath108 , while for the tensor case it is @xmath1 .",
    "in the de sitter limit , its value is shown in eq.([desitter ] ) .",
    "in general , the background evolution is not tractable analytically , and for the few cases where the background solution is analytically solvable @xcite , the @xmath8 dependence in @xmath107 may be so complicated that finding an analytic solution for eq.([master ] ) becomes impossible .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the equation is equivalent to a time independent schrodinger equation in one dimension when @xmath8 is regarded as space coordinate and @xmath109 is the potential for the wave function @xmath110 this analogy will become apparent when we introduce our method of solving eq.@xmath111 , which is nothing but the usual wkb approximation in quantum mechanics .    under the condition that the background evolution of the metric is known for a particular inflationary model",
    ", one can determine whether the approximation eq.([desitter ] ) will be applicable for the model under consideration .",
    "if so , then the system may be solved using the standard approach outlined in the preceding section .",
    "however , this is not the case for a great number of inflationary models .",
    "one can understand that this is so because the mechanism used in stopping inflation may falsify the standard approximation .",
    "additionally , the initial conformal time can not always be pushed back to negative infinity where one would impose the bunch - davies boundary condition as is the case when the expansion is truly power - law .",
    "the essential idea of our method is that , since the information one needs in order to calculate observables to compare with experiment is the value of the mode function at horizon crossing ( which is much later than the asymptotic time @xmath74 ) , it may therefore be advantageous to place the physical boundary condition closer to the time where we require accurate information .",
    "imposing the boundary condition at negative infinity may lead to a situation where the approximate form for @xmath107 in eq.([desitter ] ) has deviated greatly from the actual solution due to the lengthy intervening period of evolution .",
    "although we are placing the boundary condition nearer the era of observable inflation , we will continue to mimic the idea of bd vacuum selection in that we look at the time @xmath112 where the wavelength of the mode is deep inside the horizon , and the effect of cosmic expansion is relatively small .",
    "the situation can then be approximated as physics in minkowski space .    in this section",
    "we will first demonstrate the method with an explicit example before going on to comment on considerations on applying the method in general .",
    "the model we use as an example has background evolution that is analytically solvable @xcite .",
    "this particular model provides an interesting picture where the big bang is connected to inflation with a specific time delay .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 is very different from the slow roll plus de sitter limit , while the term @xmath1 is asymptotically equal to the de sitter limit .",
    "we will apply our method to obtain the scalar power spectrum and constrain the tensor power spectrum from observation .",
    "our point here is to show that there exist examples such that @xmath108 can not be approximated by the standard fit function , thus there is a _ need _ of introducing new method of solving mukhanov - sasaki equation .",
    "we would like to point out this model does not provide a mechanism of stopping inflation , therefore , even though our method predicts the correct power spectrum in a certain parameter space , the phenomenologically viable parameter space is expected to change when the stopping mechanism is introduced . therefore the model in question may be viewed as a demonstration tool ( due to the attractive property that it is analytically solvable at the background level ) rather than a fully complete model .",
    "we begin with an action of the form eq.@xmath113 with the scalar potential @xmath114 the potential contains the dimensionless free parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the reduced planck mass as before .",
    "the background solution for all possible combinations of @xmath116 and @xmath115 has been classified in @xcite .",
    "we will use the case @xmath118 as an example to illustrate our method .",
    "the behavior of the scale factor of this model is to initiate expansion at @xmath119 where the scale factor is exactly zero .",
    "beginning at a later time , @xmath120 @xmath121 , there is an inflationary period , and finally , when @xmath8 approaches @xmath122 , the scale factor diverges . at this point the physical time ,",
    "@xmath123 , will also diverge .",
    "of course the finite value @xmath124 is not physically significant since @xmath8 can be translated by an arbitrary amount .",
    "the solutions for the background evolution of the scale factor @xmath125 and inflaton @xmath126 are as follows@xmath127 -\\frac{1}{4}\\left [   cn\\left (   \\widetilde{\\tau}\\right )   \\right ]   ^{2}\\right\\ } ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\label{ae}\\ ] ] and@xmath128   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{1-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}cn\\left (   \\widetilde{\\tau}\\right )   \\left [   \\frac{1+cn\\left (   \\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{\\tau}\\right )   } { 1-cn\\left (   \\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{\\tau}\\right ) } \\right ]   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right )   \\label{sigma as function of z and t}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130 is a free parameter of this model which determines the scale of @xmath131 , therefore @xmath130 can be chosen so that @xmath131 is normalized in the conventional way , @xmath132 . in the present application",
    "we will choose @xmath130 so that @xmath133    the term @xmath134 is the jacobi elliptic function@xcite . following the standard method , one needs to determine whether @xmath26 and @xmath44 are approximately constants .",
    "if so , following eqs.@xmath78 and @xmath135 , one can determine the fit function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "one can easily see that the asymptotic values of @xmath26 and @xmath44 approach the constant values @xmath136 and @xmath137 respectively",
    ". these values will result in the breakdown of eq.([standard fit ] ) for @xmath0 and @xmath138 for @xmath1 . from the above expression",
    "we can also compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the result is shown in the following plots along with the fitting function    the fit function plotted in fig.@xmath139 is the predicted fit function for @xmath1 which is @xmath140 , while the fit function for fig.@xmath141 is a quadratic function @xmath142 with parameters @xmath143    in the case of the scalar perturbation , since the formula for the standard fit function breaks down , we now introduce a new quadratic fit function according to the following rules . the parameter @xmath9 is designed to match the point where @xmath107 has slope zero while @xmath144 is designed to match the value of @xmath109 at @xmath112 .",
    "the value of @xmath145 is the only parameter in the fit function , but it has to be adjusted such that the curve of @xmath146 approaches the actual @xmath147 in the region of physical interest , namely the region where the mode exits the horizon .",
    "that is to say we want a better fit for @xmath148 .",
    "the region @xmath149 corresponds to the time before the beginning of observable inflation , or before about 60 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the perturbation generated during the preceding periods have yet to re - enter our horizon , thus they have produced no observable effect .",
    "( since the universe is currently accelerating again , it is not clear to what extent regions corresponding to time intervals before the last 60 e - folds will contribute to observable effects in the future . )",

    "as will be shown later , the phenomenologically viable parameter space requires @xmath131 close to one and @xmath115 close to zero .",
    "this means the boundary condition is close to a purely outgoing wave with smal amount of incoming wave , and thus close to the standard bd vacuum .",
    "it is interesting that a small amount of incoming waves is necessary to produce correct predictions . unlike the bunch - davies boundary condition , which is imposed at the beginning of time",
    ", our method imposes the boundary condition at a finite time , @xmath112 , where there is no reason to assume there only exists an outgoing mode .",
    "one may criticize that our method introduces too many new parameters in the boundary condition",
    ". however , this may also be the case if @xmath0 can be approximated by eq.@xmath78 where the standard bunch - davies condition is meaningful .",
    "this is because transplanckian physics could significantly alter the initial condition such that the bunch - davies condition is not valid at all @xcite .",
    "thus , although more parameters are introduced in our method , the freedom is not necessarily more than the standard method",
    ".    now we express @xmath131 and @xmath115 in terms of real parameters @xmath188 @xmath189 according to the proposed boundary condition , the mode function and its derivative are given by @xmath190 where @xmath191 . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath192 . in the example we are discussing @xmath193 ,",
    "thus this assumption is always true for this case .",
    "however , with a different fit function , it is conceivable that @xmath144 could be positive , giving the condition @xmath194 in such an instance . the idea behind",
    "this choice is that at @xmath112 , the equation becomes a harmonic oscillator with constant frequency @xmath195 . for a small period of time near @xmath9",

    "the mode function will be evaluated at horizon crossing , where @xmath88 .    in order to produce an observationally consistent spectral index and its running ,",
    "we find the parameters @xmath209 and @xmath207 are 0 and 0.075 respectively .",
    "the mode function then satisfies the boundary condition@xmath210 one can derive the spectral index as well as the running of the spectral index using definition eq.@xmath211 as function of conformal time     as a function of conformal time . ]     as a function of conformal time . ]    at @xmath212 the spectral index is @xmath213 , and the running of the spectral index is @xmath214 this is within the allowed value of wmap constraints @xcite .",
    "now , consider the tensor perturbation .",
    "the mismatch of the standard fit function is shown in fig.@xmath215 .",
    "the fit function @xmath216 is a good approximation in the asymptotic region .",
    "this is because the first slow - roll parameter is approaching zero when @xmath217 despite the success in the asymptotic region , the validity of bunch - davies boundary condition is questionable .",
    "the reason is that bunch - davies vacuum imposes a condition at a fictitious conformal time @xmath74 , while in the physical universe actually starts its expansion at a finite conformal time @xmath218 the limit @xmath74 is inapplicable in our model thus the mode function evaluated from the evolution of such , an ill defined boundary condition is not reliable . thus , we shall keep the standard fit function but abandon the boundary condition that is imposed at an unphysical time",
    ". we will proceed by obtaining a general solution of the mode function , and then subsequently use the observational constraints to restrict the possible parameters . since the power spectrum of tensor perturbations has yet to be observed ,",
    "experimentally what we have to constrain is the ratio of tensor perturbation to the scalar perturbation .",
    "the most general mode function for the tensor modes is @xmath219 from the definition @xmath220 one obtains @xmath221 together with p@xmath222 computed from eq.@xmath223 as well as the observational restriction on @xmath224 , one can deduce an upper bound for @xmath225 from the wmap7 data @xcite @xmath226 , which corresponds to @xmath227      we would like to comment on how to generalize this program , such that it may be implemented for a given background evolution of an inflationary model .",
    "there is no reason , _ a priori _ , that either eq.@xmath228 in the standard method , or a quadratic function , as introduced in the previous section , should be a good fit for @xmath108 in general .",
    "our proposal in this paper has been to point out that one should not apply the standard fit function to all inflationary models without carefully examining whether it is actually a good fit .",
    "if the analytic solution for the mukahanov - sasaki equation is not attainable , one may wish to find a fit function that is analytically solvable .",
    "there exist a number of analytically solvable fit functions for @xmath0 , the quadratic function introduced in the previous section is just one simple example .",
    "another more sophisticated example is the quartic function which renders eq.@xmath42 solvable by linear combinations of the heun triconfluent function .",
    "unfortunately in practice , the introduction of a more complicated fitting function , such as the quartic function , may reduce the predictivity of the model as there will tend to be more parameters in the fit function that require matching rules to pin down their values .",
    "however the rule of thumb is simple , the employed fit function should resemble the actual curve at the region of interest , which is the moment of horizon crossing .",
    "after that , one should impose the boundary condition at a meaningful time . as we have demonstrated , using the wkb approximation at the moment when @xmath0 is flat is one sensible choice .",
    "finally , one can use the current observational data for the tensor to scalar ratio to constrain tensor perturbation . however , since the power spectrum of the tensor mode has not been observed , the constraints from the tensor sector are not overly restrictive .",
    "in order to make predictions testable by observations , inflation needs not only a model , but suitable boundary conditions .",
    "some models of inflation do not seem to fall within the realm where the standard boundary conditions may be naturally applied . with this in mind , we have discussed the introduction of an alternative method which generalizes the standard approach of computing the scalar and tensor power spectra .",
    "it is suggests that for those models whose background is analytically solvable , one should re - examine their power spectrum using our method and find how does their spectral index compare with the results from standard method .",
    "in general , this procedure will introduce additional parameters into the model , thus allowing more accurate phenomenology , with the usual drawback that introduction of more parameters decreases predictivity .",
    "this new method is implemented on a model - by - model basis , hence the generic effects of this approach have yet to be determined . for the specific example discussed in this paper , we explored an inflationary model which has analytically solvable background dynamics .",
    "we introduced a quadratic fit ( of course , other models may require more complicated fitting functions)for the function @xmath108 which appears in the mukhanov - sasaki equation for the scalar modes , and imposed boundary conditions at finite conformal time , @xmath8 .",
    "it was found that near @xmath229 the spectral index and its running , both fall into a phenomenologically acceptable range .",
    "this calculation gives an example for the implementation of our approach , although the model in question is not fully realized in the sense that it lacks a proper accounting for the cessation of inflation in order to produce the requisite amount of e - fold expansion .",
    "the capacity for altering the calculation , and thus the values , of observables predicted by inflation via this new approach is clear",
    ". it may therefore be possible that models which were hitherto discarded may need to be re - investigated in the framework of this method .",
