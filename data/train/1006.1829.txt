    "an important issue in determining the feasibility of optimally constructing unitary transformations is how the required search effort scales with the hilbert space dimension of the system under control .",
    "whereas state control and maximization of observable expectation values have met with widespread success in experimental and computational incarnations @xcite , with search effort generally invariant to the hilbert space dimension @xcite , the achievement of high fidelity unitary transformations has proved more challenging @xcite , especially for large systems .",
    "recently , a series of fundamental studies have been carried out on the underlying properties of quantum control landscapes , defined as the map between the external control field and the objective fidelity @xcite .",

    "in particular , the observation of exponential scaling with hilbert space dimension for the @xmath212 and tensor product structures suggests that lie algebra depth of @xmath23 and @xmath24 should be considered , with the engineering goal being to make transitions between distant quantum states allowed .",
    "such hamiltonian design efforts may be facilitated by the methods of hamiltonian morphing @xcite , which allow the control hamiltonian to be continuously deformed while holding the gate fidelity and the control field fixed .",
