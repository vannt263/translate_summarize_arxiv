    "the roadmap for the development of the next generation lithography has been formulated by industry in the middle of the 1990s ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a goal was to follow moore s law in the reduction of a feature size by a factor of two in two years @xcite . during the last two decades",
    "the progress in the feature size reduction has been provided by reducing the wavelength of light sources ( lasers ) used .",
    "now conventional lasers reached their limit .",
    "immersion and photoresist technologies aiming for a feature size below the @xmath0 limit reached their boundaries as well .",
    "that is why it was decided to base the next generation lithography ( ngl ) on a completely new light source  a plasma source producing extreme ultraviolet light at the wavelength of 13.5 nm aiming for a feature size of 20 nm .",
    "microelectronic technology itself contains several challenging technologies inside such as mask , reticle , resist , stepper , etc .",
    "here we discuss only the problem of the light source .",
    "15 years of development of light sources for the ngl allowed to make significant progress , and a 20  w source for a beta - level euv scanner has been delivered to industry @xcite .",
    "however , it is generally accepted that the problem of light source for high volume manufacturing ( hvm ) is not solved yet .",
    "requirements for the source are not fixed but evolve with the evolution of all the other technologies involved .",
    "for instance , requirement for the average power ( after intermediate focus ( if ) , in - band spectrum @xmath1% around 13.5 nm , etendue of the source output @xmath2 3 mm@xmath3-sr ) has been increased nearly by an order of magnitude during the last ten years , and approaches two hundred watts .    during the last years we observed rapid progress in the development of vuv and x - ray free electron lasers .",
    "the jump in the wavelength was about five orders of magnitude , from 12 @xmath4 m in 1997 down to 0.12 nm in 2009 @xcite .",
    "flash ( free electron laser in hamburg ) at desy has produced unprecedented powers of euv radiation at wavelengths of 13.5  nm and 6.8 nm , target wavelengths for the next generation lithography ( ngl ) @xcite .",
    "several schemes for a dedicated fel - based radiation source for the ngl have been proposed during last years @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the potential application for the ngl of an accelerator and fel technology developed in the framework of the flash project at desy .",
    "we show that this technology allows to construct a free electron laser operating at the wavelength of 13.5 nm and 6.8 nm with an average power of several kilowatts .",
    "this becomes possible due to two main factors .",
    "the first one is high average power ( about 100 kw ) in the electron beam of a superconducting accelerator .",
    "the second important factor is undulator tapering allowing significant increase of fel efficiency above 2% . as a result",
    ", high average radiation power of about several kilowatts can be generated .",
    "additional application of the electron beam energy recovery would allow to increase the duty factor significantly such that the average radiation power will be in the multi - ten - kw range @xcite .",
    "spectral width of the radiation ( below 2% ) fits well to the requirements of the radiation source for the next generation lithography .",
    "a free electron laser is a system consisting of a relativistic electron beam and a radiation field interacting with each other while they propagate through an undulator @xcite .",
    "the undulator is a periodical magnetic structure forcing electrons to perform transverse oscillations .",
    "when an electron beam traverses an undulator , it emits radiation at the resonance wavelength @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the undulator period , @xmath7 is the electron beam energy , @xmath8 is the dimensionless undulator strength parameter , @xmath9 is the maximum on - axis magnetic field strength of the undulator , @xmath10 is the relativistic factor , @xmath11 is the velocity of light , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are charge and mass of the electron , respectively .",
    "the electromagnetic wave is always faster than the electrons , and a resonant condition occurs when the radiation slips a distance @xmath14 relative to the electrons after one undulator period .",
    "the fields produced by the moving charges in one part of the undulator react on moving charges in another part of the undulator .",
    "thus , we deal with tail - head instability leading to a growing concentration of particles wherever a small perturbation started to occur .",
    "more details on fel physics can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "fel devices can be divided in two classes : amplifiers and oscillators .",
    "fels based on oscillator principle are limited on the short - wavelength side to ultraviolet wavelengths primarily because of mirror limitations .",
    "free electron lasing at wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet can be achieved with a single - pass , high - gain fel amplifier .",
    "the fel collective instability in the electron beam produces an exponential growth ( along the undulator ) of the modulation of the electron density on the scale of undulator radiation wavelength .",
    "power gain in excess @xmath15 may be obtained in the short wavelength range .",
    "conversion efficiency of the kinetic energy of electrons to the vuv or soft x - ray radiation can be rather high , up to a few per cent .",
    "average power of the electron beam can be high as well , of the order of a hundred kilowatts . as a results , it becomes possible to generate high average power of the radiation at the level of a few kilowatts .",
    "modern accelerator technologies provide high efficiency of the conversion of the net electric power to the electron beam ( of about 10 per cent ) , thus allowing to obtain net efficiency of fel on the level of a fraction of per mille .",
    "as we already mentioned application of the electron beam recovery may significantly increase the net efficiency .",
    "an fel amplifier starting from the shot noise in the electron beam is a device in which the electron beam produces powerful radiation during single pass through an undulator @xcite .",
    "this type of devices is frequently referred as self amplified spontaneous emission fel ( sase fel ) @xcite .",
    "efficient operation of sase fels is possible with thorough design of all systems involved .",
    "here we describe the main systems related to the flash / tesla technology .",
    "the tesla project ( tev energy linear accelerator ) has been developed by an international tesla collaboration since the beginning of the 1990s .",
    "more than 50 institutions from 12 countries were involved in the development of superconducting accelerator technology for a high energy electron - positron linear collider and for a driver - linac for an x - ray free electron laser ( xfel ) @xcite . later",
    "the tesla collaboration has been transformed into the tesla technology collaboration ( ttc ) aiming at technical development for superconducting accelerators , and gave birth to two fel projects at desy : flash flash and the european xfel @xcite .",
    "all flash / tesla type accelerators are based on superconducting accelerator modules .",
    "each module contains eight superconducting sections .",
    "each section is approximately 1 meter long and operates at a resonance frequency of 1.3 ghz .",
    "the accelerating sections are cooled by liquid helium with temperature of 2 k. the accelerating gradient may be different for different sections , and may approach 40 mv / m for the best quality sections .",
    "the spread of accelerating gradients is defined by the production technology chain available , and there is clear tendency for improving the quality @xcite .",
    "project value for average gradient in the accelerating module for the european xfel is 24.3 mv / m @xcite . dedicated technological studies are on the way aiming at achieving an average accelerating gradient in excess of 35 mv / m @xcite .",
    "these developments are performed in the framework of international linear collider ( ilc ) project .    up",
    "to four accelerating modules are powered by one rf station consisting of klystron and modulator @xcite .",
    "average and peak power of the klystron are 150 kw and 10 mw , respectively .",
    "the accelerator operates in the burst mode . for the flash project macropulse repetition rate",
    "is 10 hz , macropulse duration is 1 ms , average beam load within macropulse may reach 10 ma .",
    "the total rf pulse length for the european xfel is 1.37 ms , of which 0.72 ms are required for filling the cavity with rf power , and 0.65 ms for electron beam acceleration .",
    "macropulse repetition rate may be increased for the price of macropulse length reduction .",
    "since the filling time remains the same , higher efficiency of the accelerator is achieved at a reduced repetition rate .",
    "the electron beam is produced in a laser driven rf gun@xcite .",
    "while the linear accelerator is superconducting , the rf gun operates at room temperature .",
    "an important figure of merit for the beam quality is the transverse phase space of the electron beam or emittance @xmath16 ( it is just the product of the beam size by the angle spread ) which should not be much larger than radiation wavelength .",
    "the physical parameters related to the quality of the injector is the normalized emittance , @xmath17 .",
    "current values of the normalized emittance achieved in the rf guns produced for flash and european xfel are in the range 0.4 - 1 mm - mrad depending on the bunch charge @xcite",
    ". these values are sufficient for effective generation of x - ray generation .",
    "effective operation of the vuv / x - ray fel amplifier requires a high value of the peak beam current of about a few thousand ampers .",
    "the typical value of the peak beam current in the rf gun is about a few tens of ampers .",
    "the required value of the peak beam current is achieved in the beam formation system . during initial stage of amplification",
    "the electron bunch is accelerated in an off - crest rf phase and gains energy chirp such that particles in the head of the bunch have less energy .",
    "this leads to the compression of the bunch when the electron beam passes through the bunch compressor - a dispersive element providing different path lengths for particles with different energy .",
    "additional installation of rf sections operating at a multiple frequency improves the quality of compressed bunches .",
    "auxiliary sections operating at a frequency of 3.9 mhz are used in flash and european xfel @xcite .",
    "two and three bunch compressor stages are implemented in the flash and exfel accelerators providing peak currents up to 2.5 ka and 5 ka , respectively @xcite .",
    "undulators are widely used as insertion devices at synchrotron radiation facilities around the world .",
    "the most popular undulators are designed using permanent magnet technology @xcite .",
    "this technology reached mature level and allows to build undulators with high quality of magnetic field required for fel applications : relative field errors below per mille level and trajectory errors on a few micron level @xcite .",
    "different field geometries ( planar or helical ) can be realized providing the possibility to generate radiation with required polarization properties ( linear or circular ) .",
    "currently the length of undulator systems at the fel facilities constitute tens of meters , and exceeds hundred meters for future projects ( see table  [ tab : undulators ] ) .",
    ".undulators for vuv / x - ray fels @xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : ngl - source-68 ]    . ,",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the fel is tunable radiation source , and there is a simple deal to go over to different wavelength , for instance , to the next target wavelength of 6.8 nm discussed in the ngl community .",
    "we restrict our study electron with energies of 1250 mev and 2500 mev , and use undulators optimized for generation of 13.5 nm radiation ( see previous section ) .",
    "tuning of the wavelength is performed by the increase of the undulator gap from 12 mm to 18 mm .",
    "magnetic field changes from 1 t to 0.7 t. evolution of the energy in the radiation pulse is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pz - ngl-68 ] .",
    "comparison of the pulse energies at 6.8 nm and 13.5 nm shows reduction of the pulse energy when going to shorter wavelength .",
    "partially this reduction relates to nonoptimal undulator : period length has been optimized for 13.5 nm .",
    "another factor is reduction of the fel gain and fel efficiency due to shorterning of the wavelength .",
    "fel elefficiency can be increased with the reduction of the electron beam emittance .",
    "curves 2 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pz - ngl-68 ] show gain curves of the sase fel driven by the electron beam with normalized emittance of 1 mm - mrad .",
    "output power in the case becomes to be comparabable with the case of the wavelength 13.5 nm and @xmath18 mm - mrad .",
    "recent developments of the laser driven rf gun demonstrated feasibility for generation of the beams with rms normalized emittance well below 1 mm - mrad @xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude that it is technically feasible to produce 2 kw level of the average radiation power at the wavelength of 6.8 nm .",
    "it is important that the same hardware ( accelerator and undulator ) is used for production of the radiation with wavelength of 13.5 nm and 6.8 nm .",
    "key parameters of the radiation : temporal and spectral structure of the radiation pulse , intensity distribution of the radiation ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : p0071027 ] and [ fig : n0071027 ] ) do not differ much from characteristics of the source tuned to 13.5 nm ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : p0024029 ] and [ fig : n0024029 ] ) .",
    "up to now two technologies for the light source are developed by industry : laser produced plasma ( lpp ) , and discharge produced plasma ( dpp ) @xcite .",
    "serious obstacle on the way to a hvm source is the small efficiency of these sources which requires deposition of huge power in a small volume .",
    "another problem is the mitigation of the plasma debris required for the protection of euv optics .",
    "an fel based radiation source has evident advantages .",
    "the process of light generation takes place in vacuum , and there is no problem to utilize the spent electron beam ( remove unused power ) .",
    "the problem of debris mitigation does not exists at all .",
    "there is no collector problem since the radiation is produced in the diffraction limited volume , and there is no problem with the transport of the radiation to the exposure tool .        laser and plasma radiation sources may operate only at a limited set of discrete wavelengths .",
    "each dedicated source operates at a fixed wavelength only . with a sase fel driven by 1 - 2 gev electron beam",
    ", the available wavelength range can span from about 100 nm down to a few nanometers .",
    "this feature can be helpful for instance , for optimization of a photoresist .",
    "it is important that the same hardware ( accelerator and undulator ) can be used for production of tunable powerful radiation as we demonstrated in our paper .",
    "average power of this `` clean '' euv radiation is in the range of a few kilowatts , an order of magnitude above present requirements for a hvm source .",
    "thus , one fel set up can replace a dozen of plasma sources .",
    "currently microelectronic industry uses an approach of a single source for a single tool ( stepper ) . in the case of using a powerful fel as the source we can modify this approach to a single source for multiple tools .",
    "we can discuss , for instance , transport of the photon beam to different tools allowing their quasi - simultaneous operation @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - tool ] ) .",
    "another option which is under discussion is generation of the radiation in several undulators quasi - simultaneously @xcite .    the parameter space considered in this conceptual study does not deviate much from project parameters of flash / tesla technology",
    "main idea was the demonstration of the capabilities of this technology to produce multi - kw level of output radiation power and show that properties of the radiation meet requirements of the next generation lithography .",
    "it is important that the described device can be constructed now without additional r&d using components developed for flash and european xfel .",
    "definitely , there is a room for further optimization of the source .",
    "this can be essential subject for joint collaboration between r&d departments of microelectronic industry and developers of accelerator and fel techniques .",
    "for instance , it is rather easy to increase average output power of the source by means of increasing the length of macropulse and corresponding reduction of the repetition rate . alternatively",
    ", macropulse repetition rate can be increased for the price of reduction of the output power .",
    "this kind of considerations has been already analyzed in the framework of the european xfel project @xcite .",
    "within long term of flash / tesla technology development we can discuss extensions towards increase of duty factor up to cw mode of operation .",
    "this activity is also performed in the framework of tesla technical collaboration .",
    "one of the problems to be solved is that of high duty cycle or cw injectors generating low emittance beams @xcite .",
    "the necessary replacement of klystrons by inductive output tubes ( iot ) seems to be possible @xcite .",
    "when the injector technology becomes available , the fel based radiation source can operate in cw mode .",
    "application of energy recovery will allow to go over to higher output radiation powers .",

    "we thank o. gushchin , e. saldin , and g. shirkov for their interest in this work .",
