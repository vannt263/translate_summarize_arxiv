    "the discovery of the hard x - ray transient event swift j16449.3 + 573451 ( `` sw j1644 + 57 '' hereafter , burrows et al . 2011 ) by the swift satellite ( gehrels et al .",

    "2011 ; bloom et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the sharp onset and gradual fade - away of x - ray flux refer to tidal disruption of a star by a dormant smbh ( bloom et al .",
    "2011 ; burrows et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the super - eddington x - ray luminosity ( burrows et al . 2011 ) , bright radio afterglow ( zauderer et al . 2011 ) , as well as a stringent historical x - ray flux upper limit suggest that a relativistic jet is launched from a smbh during the tde , which is not expected in most previous tde studies ( e.g. kobayashi et al .",

    "the emission of sw j1644 + 57 suggests that the jet is highly `` particle starved '' ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) , favoring a magnetically launched jet , likely launched via the blandford - znajek ( 1977 , hereafter bz ) mechanism ( lei & zhang 2011 ) , which extracts the spin energy of the bh through a magnetic field connecting the bh event horizon and a remote astrophysical load . from observational constraints ,",
    "lei & zhang ( 2011 ) found that the smbh in sw j1644 + 57 carries a moderate to high spin .    for such events , since the star initially has no knowledge about the bh spin orientation before being disrupted and accreted , it is most likely that the initial stellar orbit is mis - aligned with the equatorial plane of the spinning bh .",
    "a natural expectation is that at least the outer part of the accretion disk is also misaligned .",
    "the tilted disk surrounding a spinning bh is subject to the lense - thirring ( hereafter lt , lense & thirring 1918 ) torque .",
    "the combined action of the lt torque and the internal viscosity of the accretion disk would lead to a twisted and warped disk , with the inner part of the disk bent towards the bh equatorial plane due to the frame - dragging effect .",
    "this is known as the bardeen - petterson ( hereafter bp ) effect ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ) . for a fully developed bp disk ,",
    "the inner part of the disk tends to be aligned with the bh equatorial plane , while the outer part of the disk remains aligned with the original stellar orbital plane .",
    "the transition radius between these two regimes is the bp radius .",
    "the warped disks have been directly observed by water maser observations in ngc 4258 ( miyoshi et al .",

    "the apparent lack of correlation between the direction of the radio jets emanating from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the plane of the host galaxy disks ( kinney et al . 2000 ; schmitt et al .",
    "2002 ) can also be explained by disk warping .    besides this theoretical motivation",
    ", some curious observational facts also point towards the possibility of a warped disk .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported a rough period of 230 ks ( @xmath3 2.7 days ) in the long - term x - ray lightcurve , although with a @xmath4 significance .",
    "saxton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) gave a more thorough analysis and derived a similar period with higher significance .",
    "more importantly , a closer inspection suggests that the late x - ray lightcurve show dips . a natural mechanism to account for these dips would be a precessing jet , possibly caused by a warped bp disk ( see also saxton et al .",
    "stone & loeb ( 2012 ) discussed the similar topic , but did nt pay attention to these peculiar observational effects .",
    "they led to the conclusion that the stellar orbital plane is almost aligned with the bh equatorial plane due to the lack of observational evidence of jet precessing .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a model to interpret the quasi - periodic feature and the narrow dips observed in the lightcurve of sw j1644 + 57 within the framework of the bp mechanism . in section 2 , we first apply a mathematical method , i.e. stepwise filter correlation ( sfc ) method ( gao et al .",
    "2012 ) , to study the x - ray lightcurve data of sw 1644 + 57 .",
    "we confirm that a @xmath5-day quasi - periodic signal exists in the late lightcurve after the initial flaring phase .",
    "we then develop a numerical model in section 3 to study disk warping and jet precessing . in section 4 , we apply the observational data to constrain the model parameters , and found several parameter sets that can roughly reproduce the observations .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "two pieces of evidence hint towards the possibility of a precessing jet in sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "the first piece is the noticeable dips in the xrt lightcurve at late times .",

    "some deep dips are clearly visible .",
    "the dashed vertical lines mark the 2.7-day period ( see more below ) .",
    "one can see that the dips roughly track this period .",
    "dips are not easy to explain within models invoking emission , but would be naturally interpreted within the frame work of jet precession where the line of sight is allowed to move away from the emission beam .    the second piece of evidence is the rough 2.7-day periodicity , which was pointed out by burrows et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and confirmed by saxton et al .",
    "we investigate this independently using a new method , stepwise filter correlation ( sfc ) method , recently developed in our group ( gao et al .",
    "the sfc method is a signal processing algorithm which stepwisely filters signals above a frequency , and looks for correlation between the lightcurves of adjacent filtered lightcurves .",
    "if there is a spectral component around a particular frequency , the lightcurves before and after filtering this particular frequency can be very different , leading to a dip in the correlation curve .",
    "the details of this method and its application to grb lightcurves are presented in gao et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . here",
    "we apply the method to the xrt lightcurve of sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "we first perform an analysis to the entire lightcurve ( curve ( a ) of lower panel of fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "since the early lightcurve displays many erratic , bright x - ray flares , the signal is dominated by these high - frequency components , and the 2.7-day component can not be identified .",
    "these flares may be related to fallback of the stellar debris with high and fluctuant accretion rate ( cannizzo et al .",
    "if we remove the early data ( say , the first two days ) , the 2.7-day dip clearly shows up ( curve ( b ) of lower panel of fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we then gradually remove more and more early data points and everytime redo the sfc analysis ( curves ( c - e ) of the lower panel of fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the 2.7-day dip is always there .",

    "the dragging of the inertial frame ( frame dragging ) produced by a kerr black hole causes precession of a particle if its orbital plane is inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of the black hole .",

    "the torque tends to align the angular momentum of the matter in the disk with that of the bh , thus causing the inclination angle between the angular momentum vectors to decrease with decreasing distance from the bh .",
    "this is the bp effect ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ) , which is the combination of the lt effect and the internal viscosity of the accretion disk .",
    "the effect is more prominent in the inner part of the disk due to the short range of the lt effect .",
    "the outer part of the disk tends to remain in the orientation defined by the original stellar orbit .",
    "considering that the disk may be thick , stone & loeb ( 2012 ) suggested that the disk is not subject to the bp warping effect .",
    "this conclusion is based on an inferred large accretion rate , and a weak magnetic field viscosity as revealed in a grmhd simulation ( fragile et al .",
    "2007 ) . motivated by the observational evidence discussed in section 2 , in this paper",
    "we suggest that the disk can be thin , and the bp effect indeed plays a role , at least after the initial flares when the accretion rate drops significantly . to justify this assumption , we argue that the dynamical viscosity and magnetic stress in the disk can be larger than what is invoked by fragile et al .",

    ", zhuravlev & ivanov ( 2008 ) found that the bp effect can take place if the viscosity parameter @xmath47 is sufficiently large .",
    "more importantly , the absolute accretion rate of sw j1644 + 57 is not well constrained from the data .",
    "the previous estimates ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2011 ; lei & zhang 2011 ) were derived by normalizing the total x - ray fluence with the total mass of the star , and use the flux to derive the accretion rate under the assumption that all the mass of the star is accreted into the black hole . for an assumed stellar mass @xmath48 ,",
    "the peak accretion rate is around @xmath49 ( lei & zhang 2011 ; shao et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the late time ( when dips show up ) accretion rate is @xmath50 , about 2 orders lower .",
    "this corresponds to the eddington luminosity of a @xmath51 bh with disk efficiency of about 10% .",
    "however , the real accretion rate can be a factor of a few to 10 lower than this value .",
    "for example , the accreted star may be even less massive . also according to recent mhd simulations by yuan et al .",
    "( 2012a , 2012b ) , a hot accretion flow would have a strong mass outflow .",
    "the net accretion rate in the inner disk would be then significantly reduced .",
    "considering these factors , it is possible that the condition @xmath52 is satisfied , where @xmath53 is half thickness of the disk , and @xmath47 is the viscosity parameter .",
    "we could therefore assume that at least the inner disk is thin after the flare phase , so that the bp effect would come into play to warp the disk .",
    "for a warped disk , we follow the formalism of pringle ( 1992 ) .",
    "there are two viscosity parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath54 is the standard shear viscosity in a flat disk , and @xmath55 is the viscosity associated with the vertical shear motion describing the diffusion of warping distortion through the disk . in order to study the bp effect ,",

    ", warp propagation would occur in a diffusive way ( popatoizou & lin 1995 ) .",

    "roughly speaking , the disk becomes aligned with the bh spin at @xmath66 and keeps its original inclination for @xmath67 .",
    "scheuer & feiler ( 1996 ) have found an analytical steady - state solution to the above equation ( removing the time - dependent term @xmath68 ) , subject to various simplifying assumptions about the disk density distribution and the inner boundary condition .",

    "it is based on a first - order approximation and a small inclination angle ( @xmath69 ) assumption . in our modelling , instead of applying this solution , we solve the equations numerically following the numerical scheme outlined in pringle ( 1992 ) .",

    "a precessing disk would induce jet precession . in our model ,",
    "the relativistic jet is launched near the bh by the blandford - znajek process ( lei & zhang 2011 ) . however",
    ", the jet direction is not determined by the normal direction at the inner disk , but is rather defined by normal direction at an outer region in the disk near @xmath12 .",
    "this is because the magnetic field threading the disk would drive an outflow from the disk surface via the blandford & payne ( 1982 ) mechanism .",
    "a centrifugally driven outflow is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes an angle less than @xmath95 with the disk surface .",

    ", width=264,height=264 ]    finally , the observed x - ray lightcurve sw j1644 + 57 does not have strict periodic dips . in some phases",
    "the dips disappear , and in some phases the dips do not appear at exactly the predicted phase ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 , and fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we believe that this is related to some stochastic processes involved in accretion and jet launching .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath105 may vary with time , and @xmath12 may slightly vary at different epochs . in order to test this idea ,",
    "we carry out a range of simulations to the lightcurves .",
    "first , we introduce a small time - scale variability in the lightcurve overlapped on the @xmath168 envelope ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) , which may be a result of stochastic magnetic dissipation ( e.g. zhang & yan 2011 ) or fluctuations of accretion rate ( e.g. wang et al . 2006 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the function @xmath111 ( [ psit ] ) is taken as an oscillatory function of @xmath74 with frequency equal to the lt frequency .",
    "next , we introduce a variation of lorentz factor by allowing @xmath105 to randomly vary in the range of ( 2 , 25 ) during each precession period . we simulate four cases in fig.[fig7 ] , which correspond to `` a '' , `` b '' , `` c '' and `` d '' in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "we find that the change of lorentz factor can indeed result in the disappearance of dips at some epochs . the peaks and dips in fig.[fig7]a are well separated and are too spiky .",
    "the lightcurve in fig.[fig7]d on the other hand is too smooth , without clear evidence of dips .",
    "this suggests that they do not resemble the geometric configuration of sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "the other two cases , i.e. , figs.[fig7]b and [ fig7]c , give interesting quasi - periodic features with noticeable dips .",
    "even though we can not fully constrain the geometry of the sw j1644 + 57 system , we can say that it should resemble the conditions of these two cases based on the simulation results . in our calculation , a relatively large @xmath105 is needed to give significant dips .",
    "late time x - ray afterglow months after trigger no longer show significant dips with a 2.7-day period ( d. n. burrows , 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "this could be understood as due to a systematically reduction of @xmath105 at late epochs when luminosity drops significantly .",
    "in this paper , we propose that the sw j1644 + 57 jet launched from a smbh precesses .",
    "this comes from two independent arguments .",
    "first , a tidally disrupted star should not have knowledge about the spin direction of the bh before disruption , so that the original stellar orbit very likely has an inclination with respect to the equatorial plane of the bh .",
    "a rapidly spinning bh ( which is probably the main reason to launch a relativistic jet , lei & zhang 2011 ) tends to distort the accretion flow and warp the accretion disk due to strong lt frame dragging .",
    "this would naturally result in a precessing jet if the accretion rate is low enough .",
    "second , observationally two pieces of evidence hint towards a precessing jet : the rough 2.7-day periodicity and the noticeable lightcurve dips .",
    "we performed a sfc analysis to the observed 5 - 30 day x - ray lightcurve , and confirmed the 2.7-day rough period .",
    "we then carried out detailed theoretical modeling on disk warping and jet precessing , and inferred the underlying parameters of the jet system from the observational data .",
    "we found that due to disk warping , the original stellar orbit does not have to be nearly aligned with the bh equatorial plane ( cf .",
    "stone & loeb 2012 ) .",
    "rather , @xmath169 can be as large as @xmath163 . in order to reproduce the depths of the lightcurve dips and their distribution ,",
    "the lorentz factor should range from moderate values to values as high as 20 .",
    "the duty cycle @xmath131 , which describes the fraction of time when the line of sight intersects the jet , is found to be a moderate value , slightly smaller than 0.5 .    through simulations",
    ", we were able to reproduce lightcurves similar to the observed one .",
    "saxton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) interprets the diminishing dips in some periods as due to jet nutation .",
    "our sfc analysis does not show another quasi frequency that might be related to nutation .",
    "we attribute the diminishing dips to fluctuations in @xmath105 .",
    "the mis - match between the 2.7-day period and some dips is also understandable , since the outflow that collimates the jet may not always launched strictly from @xmath62 , or @xmath62 could vary stochastically during the event .",
    "a warp is also possible to propagate in a wave - like mode when @xmath170 or when the disk is rather thick ( papaloizou & lin 1995 , papaloizou & terquem 1995 , lubow & ogilvie 2000 ) .",
    "lubow , ogilvie & pringle ( 2002 ) found the solutions of wave - like warped disk . for a steady - state prograde disk",
    ", the inner disk still has a significant inclination angle .",
    "however , our modeling suggests that in order to reproduce data , a relatively small inclination angle at the inner disk is required .",
    "this model is therefore not favored .",
    "a steady - state retrograde on the other hand has a small - inclination angle at inner radii , which could be consistent with the data . since it is entirely possible that the incoming star comes from a direction to make a retrograde disk , and since the bz jet power does not sensitively depend on the orientation of the disk spin with respect to the black hole spin ( tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2012 ) , we believe that a retrograde disk with wave - like warping ( lubow et al . 2002 ) would be another possibility to interpret the phenomenology of sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "one major uncertainty in our model is viscosity . in our modelling , we have adopted @xmath73 throughout , and used eq.([nu2/nu1 ] ) to calculate the ratio @xmath171 .",
    "varying @xmath47 within a reasonable range ( @xmath102 required by the thin disk condition ) would not significantly change our results , since the numerical solutions are only sensitive to @xmath97 when @xmath78 and @xmath169 are given , while @xmath97 is constrained by the observed 2.7-day quasi - period .",
