    "according to @xcite , the concept of `` compact galaxies '' was introduced by @xcite , in order to refer to galaxies barely distinguishable from stars on the palomar sky survey plates . in a subsequent paper ,",
    "@xcite refined the definition of a `` compact galaxy '' to be any galaxy ( or part of a galaxy ) whose surface brightness is brighter than 20 mag arcsec@xmath3 in any chosen wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the term `` blue '' , as used by @xcite , refers to those galaxies satisfying the previous condition on both blue and red plates @xcite .",
    "later on , @xcite introduced the term `` blue compact dwarf '' ( bcd ) referring to those compact galaxies characterized by three main properties : low luminosity ( @xmath8 ) , small sizes ( diameters less than 1 kpc ) , and strong narrow emission lines superposed on a nearly flat continuum , similar to hii regions in spiral galaxies . as their name suggests ,",
    "the visible colors of bcds appear to be blue .",
    "the star forming rates in bcds are huge in comparison with those in dis ( between 0.1 and 1 @xmath9 yr@xmath10 , e.g. @xcite ) , and metallicities are low ( oxygen abundance between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , e.g. @xcite ) , suggesting young chemical ages .",
    "@xcite undertook the first systematic approach to study bcds , observing hi fluxes for a large sample ( 115 targets ) for which they derived hi profiles , neutral hydrogen masses and total masses . using the irtf 3 m telescope , @xcite observed in the near - inrared ( nir ) a smaller bcd sample ( 36 targets ) , deriving a color - metallicity relation and a well defined color - luminosity relation which suggested that star formation processes are intimately linked to total masses .",
    "@xcite pioneered nir surface photometry , observing 13 dwarfs in virgo including a few bcds .",
    "the author concluded that the nir colours of the bcds are paradoxically red , possibly indicating an intermediate - age stellar population .",
    "no simple evolutionary link between bcds , dis and des in the sample could be discerned .    using a 3-component decomposition scheme applied to the surface brightness profiles of 12 bcds",
    ", @xcite found that the size and luminosity of the purported starburst component depends upon the luminosity of the underlying component , as well as on the hi mass of the bcd . comparing the structural properties of bcds with those of other types of dwarfs",
    ", the authors found that for the same @xmath13 luminosity , the underlying component of a bcd has a central brightness brighter by @xmath14 1.5 mag and an exponential scale length smaller by a factor of @xmath14 2 than that of dis and des .",
    "employing some larger samples , other authors have derived total magnitudes , surface brightness profiles and profile decompositions in the visible @xcite and more recently in the nir @xcite . based upon a small sample ( 12 targets )",
    "observed in the nir , @xcite found a systematic excess of light in the @xmath15 band with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath0 and their previous observations in the visible , indicating that a stellar population of red giants dominates the flux .",
    "moreover , comparisons of the metallicity - color relations of bcds and globular clusters show very little difference , indicating that bcds are most probably old , in contradiction with previous results . employing a small sample ( 9 targets )",
    "observed in the nir , @xcite found that the morphology of bcds is basically the same as in the optical .    using hst and ground - based optical and nir data ,",
    "@xcite investigated i zw 18 , known to be the least chemically evolved star - forming bcd galaxy in the local universe , with an oxygen abundance of @xmath17(o / h)@xmath147.2 , or 1/50 of the sun @xcite . in the optical , its exponential profile is not due to an evolved stellar disc underlying its star - formation regions , but rather , due to extended ionized gas emission .",
    "the unresolved stellar component , though very compact , is not exceptional with respect to structural properties for intrinsically faint dwarfs .",
    "however , it differs strikingly from the red low surface brightness host of standard bcds .",
    "also , unlike more evolved bcds , the stellar component of i zw 18 is much more compact than the ionized gas envelope .    despite three decades of study at various wavelengths ,",
    "at least two basic questions remain open about bcds , namely their ages and possible evolutionary links between bcds , dis and des . in particular , how to decouple the diffuse underlying component from the young starburst regions remains a fundamental problem in studying dwarf galaxies .",
    "the solution is easier to achieve in the nir , which has the advantage of better tracing the diffuse component of bcds , whose flux in the visible is overwhelmed by young starbursts .",
    "about four years ago we started a long - term research programme to investigate the nir properties of dis and bcds @xcite .",
    "the first paper of this study , hereafter paper i , addressed the dis @xcite .",
    "based upon deep data derived from a sample of 34 field dis observed at cfht , we have recently found an universal law fitting their nir surface brightness profiles .",
    "we also found that these data permit the definition of a fundamental plane for the dis ( paper i ) .",
    "the second paper of this study approaches the bcds . to this end , we have acquired nir deep images of 16 bcds in the virgo cluster . using these data and our insights about dis , we employ surface photometry to address the nir morphology of bcds in an attempt to provide new insight regarding possible evolutionary links between dis and bcds .",
    "the organization of the present paper follows the one of paper i. in  [ sample ] we present the sample selection criteria , and in  [ observations ] our observations .",
    "the image reduction method is presented in  [ reduction ] .",
    "surface photometry will be addressed in ",
    "[ surface ] .",
    "photometric data are used in  [ properties ] to study the nir properties of bcds .",
    "conclusions are presented in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the bcd candidates were selected according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "common distance , i.e. members of the virgo cluster as defined by the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; @xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "classified as bcd or di / bcd , according to the literature ( i.e. , ned ) ; 3 .",

    "absolute magnitude between @xmath19 .    by restricting targets to the virgo cluster",
    ", we hoped to reduce scatter in distance - dependent parameters . by minimizing the density of intergalactic gas",
    ", we would avoid perturbations which might be caused by ram - pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "finally , by restricting the luminosity range , we hoped to be able to make a statistically relevant comparison with dis .",
    "we identified 16 bcds which satisfy these conditions .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .    in paper",
    "i , it was shown that nir surface brightness profiles of dis flatten toward the centre . however , two nearby galaxies classified as dis , namely ngc  1569 and ngc  3738 , display centrally - peaked surface brightness profiles .",
    "ngc  1569 , which has a distance modulus of @xmath20 ( paper i ) , is well known for its central starburst activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  3738 , which is located in the canes venatici i cloud at @xmath21 , also has been previously suggested to harbour stochastic star formation processes @xcite . due to their nir flux excesses at small radii",
    ", we add ngc  1569 and ngc  3738 to the virgo bcd sample in this paper",
    ". we will show that their surface brightness profiles suggest that they are bcds , not dis .",
    "between 2001 and 2004 we had 4 observing runs ( 21 nights in total ) on the 2.1  m telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional in the sierra san pedro mrtir ( oan - spm ) in baja california , mexico .",
    "the primary objective of the runs was to obtain deep imaging of a sample of virgo bcds in the nir , all of which have known or soon - to - be - known metallicities .",
    "all galaxies were observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands using the camila nir camera at the @xmath22 focus of the 2.1  m telescope .",

    "the weather during feb - mar at oan - spm was unstable throughout the four runs , with clear skies less than half the allocated time and only one night with photometric conditions .",
    "most of the allocated observing time was bright ( moon within 5 days of full ) , but this is less important when observing in the nir , as moonlight brightens the sky by about 0.3 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath1 and about 0.9 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath0 .    during the four runs , we imaged in @xmath0 and @xmath1 16 bcds in virgo .",
    "we took the data starting around local time 23h when the airmass was below @xmath26 .",
    "because of cirrus clouds most of the time , variable exposure times of 2070 min in @xmath1 and 1540 min in @xmath0 were used in order to reach @xmath27 mag arcsec@xmath3 and @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "these exposures were obtained by combining sequences of one - minute frames in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 . these one minute",
    "sub - exposures were acquired unguided . during the first run , we cycled the targets ( vcc 24 and vcc 324 in @xmath1 ) through the four quadrants of the chip . during the next three runs , we sampled the sky half as often as the targets in regions chosen randomly to be 4 to 5 arcmin away from the galaxies .",
    "each galaxy frame was dithered by about 3@xmath29 . in short , we adopted the following observing sequence : @xmath30 we present the observing log for all four runs in table  [ tbl-2 ] . in the last column",
    "we include the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , measured on a few stars in each reduced image .",
    "we observed ngc  1569 and ngc  3738 on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) in mar 2002 , using exposures tuned to match the same surface brightness limit as our oan - spm virgo observations .",
    "details of the observations and data reduction of these two galaxies are given in paper i.",
    "one bad pixel map was built for each run using flat field images taken with two different exposure times .",
    "it was applied as the first step in the data reduction process to all our raw images ( using the badpix task of iraf ) .    for each filter ,",
    "a flat field was built for each run from two series of twilight sky images taken with long and short exposure times .",
    "the low - signal flat was subtracted from the high- signal flat in order to produce the final flat field image .",
    "removal of the background represents the most important step in nir observations , especially when observing the outer regions of faint galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to remove the variable airglow and thermal contributions , the sky frame observed close to each science frame",
    "was subtracted from the science frame .",
    "the sky - subtracted galaxy frames were divided by the flat field , then leveled additively by forcing the corners to zero . finally , they were combined using the imcombine task in median mode , which eliminated the hot pixels , cosmic rays , and negative residuals that appear in the reduced frames after sky subtraction .",
    "the collection of iraf scripts created to reduce our data is available online .",
    "the reduced @xmath0-band images of the 16 virgo bcds observed are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ oanspm_galaxies ] .    throughout our runs , we planned to observe persson reference stars @xcite to calibrate our observations .",
    "as only one night turned out to be photometric , we derived the zero - point for each reduced image using 3 to 12 2mass stars appearing in each field . for most images",
    ", we estimate the zero - point errors to be less than 0.05 mag , with the maximum reaching about 0.2 mag in three sparsely populated cases : vcc 641 ( including only one 2mass star in the field ) , and vcc 144 and vcc 1313 ( with only two 2mass stars each ) .",
    "due to the relatively small telescope aperture and poor spatial resolution , it was not possible to resolve stars at the distance of virgo .",
    "we employed the task ellipse of the stsdas package under iraf to perform surface photometry .",
    "@xmath1 observations were more affected than @xmath0 by the poor weather conditions ( high humidity and cirrus ) , so we preferred to use images in @xmath0 to determine the ellipse fitting parameters .",
    "we used the ellipse task in two stages .",
    "first , we approximated the initial ellipse centres , ellipticities and position angles , but allowed them to vary freely with radius during the fitting .",
    "then we plotted the fits using isopall to analyze the outer isophotes where the underlying diffuse component is expected to reflect the geometry of the galaxy . at large",
    "radii ( e.g. , close to the semimajor axis given by ned ) , the fitting parameters can be regarded as constant , none of them showing isophotal twists or tidal distortions in the outer regions . using these values ,",
    "in the second stage we fixed the centre , ellipticity , and the position angle and repeated the fitting process for both bandpasses . setting the fitting parameters to be constant is a more robust approach to model a galaxy s brightness in its outer regions . in table",

    "this method is sensitive to the sky noise at large radii , to the imperfect manual cleaning of the field stars , and also to the starburst region at small radii where most of the sbps are seen to brighten abruptly .",

    "<S> a sample of 16 blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) in the virgo cluster has been imaged in the near - infrared ( nir ) in @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the 2.1 m telescope at oan - spm in mexico . </S>",
    "<S> isophotes as faint as @xmath2 = 24 mag arcsec@xmath3 and @xmath4 = 23 mag arcsec@xmath3 have been reached in most of the targets . </S>",
    "<S> surface brightness profiles can be fitted across the whole range of radii by the sum of two components : a hyperbolic secant ( sech ) function , which is known to fit the light profiles of dis , and a gaussian component , which quantifies the starburst near the centre . </S>",
    "<S> isophotal and total fitted nir magnitudes have been calculated , along with semimajor axes at @xmath2 = 23 mag arcsec@xmath3 and @xmath4 = 22 mag arcsec@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse underlying component and the young starburst have been quantified using the profile fitting . </S>",
    "<S> most color profiles show a constant color , between @xmath5 to @xmath6 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse component represents the overwhelming majority of the nir light for most bcds , the starburst enhancing the flux by less than about 0.3 mag . </S>",
    "<S> linear correlations were found between the sech scale length and the sech magnitude , and between the sech semimajor axis and the sech magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> overall , galaxies with more luminous diffuse components are larger and brighter in the centre . </S>",
    "<S> the central burst correlates with the diffuse component , with brighter bcds having stronger star - bursts , suggesting that more massive objects are forming stars more efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> bcds lie on the `` fundamental plane '' defined by dwarf irregulars ( diss ) in paper i , following the same relation between sech absolute magnitude , sech central surface brightness , and the hydrogen line - width @xmath7 , although the scatter is larger than for the dis . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> correlations between the sech absolute magnitude and the sech central surface brightness in @xmath1 for bcds and dis are equally good , indicating that bcd line widths may be enhanced by turbulence or winds . </S>"
