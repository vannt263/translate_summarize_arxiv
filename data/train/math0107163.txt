    "the subject of this exposition is the general theory of frobenius algebras with group actions .",
    "these structures arise when one is studying the algebraic structures stemming from a geometry associated to a physical theory with a global finite gauge group [ dw , dvvv , iv , v ] .",
    "the most prominent example of this type in mathematics is the gromov ",
    "witten theory of orbifolds [ cr ] , which are global quotients .",
    "the use of orbifold constructions is the cornerstone of the original mirror construction [ gp ] .",
    "the orbifolds under study in that context are so  called landau  ginzburg orbifold theories , which have so far not been studied mathematically .",
    "these correspond to the frobenius manifolds coming from singularities and are studied as examples in detail in the present paper .    a common aspect of the physical treatment of quotients by group actions is the appearance of so called twisted sectors .",
    "this roughly means that if one wishes to take the quantum version of quotient by a group action , one first has to construct an object for each element in the group together with a group action on this object and in a second step take invariants in all of these components . whereas classically one considers only the @xmath0invariants of the original object which constitutes the sector associated to the identity , the untwisted sector .",
    "we give the first complete axiomatic treatment , together with a natural geometric interpretation for this procedure , which provides a common basis for applications such as singularities with symmetries or laundau  ginzburg orbifolds , orbifold cohomology and quantum cohomology of global quotients and in a sense all other string  orbifold versions of classical theories .",
    "our treatment shows that the construction of twisted sectors is not merely an auxiliary artifact , but is essential .",
    "this is clearly visible in the case of the frobenius algebra associated to the singularity of type @xmath1 together with a @xmath2 action and the singularity of type @xmath3 with @xmath4 action , which are worked out in detail in the last paragraph .",
    "in particular the former example exhibits a version of mirror symmetry in which it is self  dual .",
    "the twisted sectors are the key in this mirror duality , since it is the sum of twisted sectors that is dual to the untwisted one .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop the theory of orbifold frobenius algebras along the now classical lines of atiyah , dubrovin , dijkgraaf and segal .",
    "i.e.  we start by introducing the algebraic structures in an axiomatic fashion .",
    "there is an important difference to the theory with trivial group in that there are two structures with slightly different @xmath0-action to be considered which are nevertheless present .",
    "these versions differ by a twist with a character . in the singularity version , on the non  twisted level , they correspond to the different @xmath0modules on the cohomology and the milnor ring [ wa ] . in physical terms ,",
    "these two structures are related by spectral flow . to be even more precise",
    ", one structure carries the natural multiplication and the other the natural scalar product .",
    "the next step is a cobordism realization of the theory .",
    "there are ramifications of the present exposition with [ fq , t ] , if the above mentioned character is trivial .",
    "this is , however , not necessarily the case and in the most interesting examples worked out in the last paragraph , this is not the case .",
    "the key structure here is a non  commutative multiplication on the sum of all the twisted sectors , even before taking invariants .",
    "this is a novel approach never considered before .    in order to apply our theory to landau ",
    "ginzburg models or singularity theory in a sense the original building blocks for mirror symmetry , we introduce a large class of examples , so  called special @xmath0frobenius algebras .",
    "this class contains the class of jacobian @xmath0frobenius algebras which in turn encompass the singularity examples and those of manifolds whose cohomology ring can be described as a quotient by a jacobian ideal .",
    "here it is important to note that everything can be done in a super ( i.e.  @xmath4graded ) version .",
    "this introduces a new degree of freedom into the construction corresponding to the choice of parity for the twisted sectors .",
    "lastly , we explicitly work out several examples including the transition from the singularity @xmath5 to @xmath6 via a quotient by @xmath4 , this is the first purely mathematical version of this correspondence avoiding path integrals . in this situation",
    "the presence of the ramond algebra explains the results obtained by [ wa ] in the situation of singularities with symmetries as studied by arnold .",
    "we furthermore show that @xmath7 leads to ( twisted)-group algebras .    for jacobian frobenius algebras",
    ", we also introduce a duality transformation which allows us to show that orbifolding plays the role of mirror symmetry .",
    "we show that the pair @xmath8 is mirror dual to @xmath9 via orbifolding by @xmath2 . applying the same principle to @xmath10",
    "we find the underlying frobenius algebra structure for the a ",
    "model realization of @xmath11 [ w , jkv ] .    in the case",
    "that the frobenius algebra one starts out with comes from a semi ",
    "simple frobenius manifold and the quotient of the twisted sector is not trivial , there is unique extension to the level of frobenius manifolds .",
    "this is the case in the above example of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the general theory presented here applies to the orbifold cohomology of global quotients , as worked out in [ fg ] , who found our postulated non  commutative structure in that situation .",
    "furthermore the theory of special g  twisted frobenius algebras in the case where g is the symmetric group sheds new light on the construction of [ ls ] , explaining the uniqueness and how the general structure of their multiplication is fixed [ k3 ] .",
    "recently the structure of discrete torsion was uncovered and explained in [ k4 ] to be given by forming tensor products in the sense introduced below with twisted group rings .",
    "the synthesis of these results and an application to the hilbert scheme can be found in [ k5 ] .",
    "this work is the written version of talk presented at the wagp2000 conference in october 2000 , which contained all algebraic constructions and examples in full detail , and the talk at the workshop on `` mathematical aspects of orbifold string theory '' in may 2001 , which contained the geometric cobordism part of the third paragraph .",
