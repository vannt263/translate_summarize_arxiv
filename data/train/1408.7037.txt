    "* for two recent reviews on different aspects of the smbh - host galaxy coevolution ) .",
    "essential points to study the galaxy evolution are the identification of agn in all states of accretion and obscuration and an accurate assessment of their physical properties , in order to infer their influence ( `` feedback '' ) on the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "the `` first order '' model proposed to explain their characteristics , known as the unified model @xcite , assumes that all the agn have a similar internal structure .",
    "the basic idea is that most of the observed differences are caused by the angle between our line of sight and the plane of the system . in particular",
    ", the toroidal obscuring material supposed to partially cover the nuclear engine along particular lines of sight regulates the possibility of observing in the optical spectrum both broad and narrow ( optically unobscured , or type  1 , agn ) or only narrow ( optically obscured , or type  2 , agn ) emission lines .",
    "confirmations of this schematic picture come from spectropolarimetric studies of optically obscured agn , and from x - ray observations ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , several authors suggested a possible evolution of the obscuration with cosmic time , connected with the smbh growth ( @xcite ; @xcite , recently updating the original model presented by @xcite ) in addition to the effects of different viewing angles .",
    "the main phase of efficient accretion would be characterized by agn heavily obscured by gas and dust ; this obscuring matter would be then swept away by the nuclear radiation , and the accreting smbh would shine as an optically luminous quasar ( qso ) for a brief period , until it runs out of gas .",
    "the final product of the sequence is a `` dead qso '' inside a passively evolving galaxy . in this scenario ,",
    "unobscured agn are a subsequent phase of obscured qso .    in the framework of the unified model",
    ", we expect that absorbed and unabsorbed accreting nuclei share the same intrinsic properties ( e.g. , luminosity , bh mass , and accretion rate ) .",
    "conversely , an evolutionary pattern for the two classes of agn would imply a difference in their physical properties .",
    "recently , a possible link between accretion and obscuration has been presented by @xcite and @xcite . by discussing the effects of accretion driven feedback on gas clouds in the innermost region of an agn",
    ", the authors proposed that dusty absorbing structures around an agn can be stable only for column densities @xmath8[@xmath2 ] , where @xmath5 is the agn eddington ratio , defined as the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the eddington luminosity[@xmath4 ] , represents the exact balance between inward gravitational force and outward radiation force acting on the gas , assumed to be of ionized hydrogen in a spherical configuration . ] .",
    "the assessment of the nuclear properties of absorbed agn is an issue that becomes more and more difficult as the amount of circumnuclear obscuring medium along the line of sight increases and does not permit a clear and direct view to the central energy source .",
    "in addition , at low nuclear luminosities a host contribution at optical - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths is expected to be increasingly noticeable , making even harder to isolate the nuclear component .",
    "x - ray surveys are one of the best approaches to search for obscured agn , since in this band the emission is less affected by absorption , if compared with the ultraviolet ( uv)-optical domain . in this paper",
    "we discuss the broad - band physical properties of all the x - ray absorbed qsos ( @xmath11@xmath2 , intrinsic @xmath3@xmath4 ; hereafter , xqso2 ) in the xmm-_newton _  bright serendipitous survey institutes in the esa community ; a full description of the role of the ssc is given in @xcite . ]",

    "briefly , for a fixed nuclear luminosity , the incident radiation would result on an easier sweeping away of the absorber when the medium is more dusty . assuming a dust - to - gas ratio constant during the process of `` cleaning '' , this translates in a `` forbidden region '' at high @xmath51and high `` classical '' @xmath5 ( i.e. , derived by assuming a distribution of gas composed only of ionized hydrogen ) . in this region , absorbing dusty gas clouds are unstable to radiation and absorption may be transient or variable . for lower `` classical '' eddington ratios , also quite dense absorbing clouds can survive to the radiation pressure ( `` long - lived clouds region '' ) .",
    "finally , sources with low @xmath51  ( @xmath371@xmath2 ) can accrete at high @xmath5 , being the absorption possibly associated with dust lanes , far away from the nucleus , so as to be retained by a gravitational mass large enough to balance also an intense nuclear emission .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nheddr ] we plot the xqso2s studied here ( red filled circles ) in the @xmath51-@xmath5 diagram ; the blue open squares mark the positions of the x - ray unabsorbed agn in the xbs with @xmath372@xmath4 .",
    "unlike in the previous sections , to properly fill the plane we do not restrict the comparison to agn with @xmath373@xmath2 , but we consider the whole sample studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath374@xmath2 ) . as evident from the figure ,",
    "our xqso2s populate the `` forbidden region '' proposed by fabian and collaborators ( the white part of the plot ) . the agreement found in sect .",
    "[ sect : cflbol ] between the different estimates of @xmath177 guarantees that this result does not depend on the method adopted to derive the bolometric luminosity .",
    "in particular , the small scatter found between the bolometric luminosities derived from equation  [ eq : lirlbol1 ] and from @xmath364 is not enough to move any source outside the `` forbidden region '' .",
    "the `` effective eddington limit '' drawn in fig .  [ fig : nheddr ] ( grey continuous line ) has been calculated for a grain abundance typical of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and under the hypothesis that the only inward gravitational force of importance is that from the central bh ( see * ? ? ?",
    "different assumptions can modify the shape of the `` forbidden region '' .",
    "the lower is @xmath51 , the stronger are the effects of a decreasing of the grain abundance ( e.g. , long - dashed grey line in fig .  [",
    "fig : nheddr ] ) . ratios of optical extinction @xmath131 to x - ray column density @xmath51  lower than the galactic dust - to - gas ratio are not unusual in agn @xcite ; in @xmath92 out of the @xmath96 xqso2s , for which we were able to properly model the nuclear properties , we find a dust - to - gas ratio lower than the galactic one ( we stress again that in sect .  [",
    "sect : sed ] the dust extinction from the sed modelling was derived independently of the value of @xmath51  from the x - ray spectra ) .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the presence of stars inwards from the dusty gas clouds close to the nucleus would increase the effective eddington limit by an amount proportional to the total enclosed mass , regardless of the amount of obscuration .",
    "near - ir high - resolution data for @xmath92 seyfert galaxies @xcite have revealed evidence for recent , intense , short - lived starbursts on few pc scale distance from the bh , leaving behind massive and vertically thick nuclear star clusters .",
    "we suggest here a further effect that could concur in reducing the proposed locus of short life : the estimation of the radiation pressure boost factor presumes isotropic emission from the accretion disk , while emission from an optically thick disk is , in principle , anisotropic .",
    "following e.g.  @xcite , the dependence from the polar angle @xmath375 of the radiation flux from a unit surface area of the disk can be expressed as @xmath376 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the assumption of isotropy , that adopts the radiation observed face - on as an estimate of the flux incident on the torus at an angle @xmath377 with respect to the axis of the system , overestimates @xmath378 by a factor @xmath379 : @xmath380 where @xmath381 is the angle between the rotation axis of the disk and the line of sight . as an example , for a @xmath382 , typical of type  1 agn , the incident radiation on the torus surface at an angle @xmath383 would be reduced by a factor of @xmath384 .",
    "this would reflect on an increasing in the `` effective eddington limit '' in this direction by a factor of @xmath385 .",
    "qualitatively , a combination of low grain abundance ( e.g. , of the order of one tenth of the ism abundance ) , enclosed mass higher than @xmath148 ( e.g. , twice the mass of the central bh ) , and anisotropy of the disk emission , would reduce the proposed `` forbidden region '' in the @xmath51-@xmath5 plane as marked by the dashed grey line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nheddr ] .",
    "in this paper , we presented a detailed analysis of the accretion properties of a complete sample of @xmath0 xqso2s ( column density @xmath1@xmath2  and x - ray luminosity @xmath3@xmath4 ; @xmath13 , plus one object at @xmath386 ) drawn from the xbs .",
    "the bright flux of these sources guarantees a high detection rate in a number of multiwavelength catalogues ( _ spitzer _ , wise , _ sdss _ , galex ) , thus allowing us ( in combination with proprietary observations ) to construct photometric broad - band sed from the optical range up to @xmath387 m ( observed frame ) , or even @xmath388 m ( observed frame ) . by analysing the sed with a combination of empirical templates",
    "we were able to separate the nuclear and the host - galaxy emission .",
    "for all the sources , we obtained the masses of the central black hole from the luminosity of the host galaxy , using the well - known scaling relations linking the bh mass and the host properties .",
    "to derive the nuclear bolometric luminosities , we used the properties of the x - ray unabsorbed high - luminosity agn ( @xmath389@xmath2and @xmath3@xmath4 ; xqso1s ) in the xbs .",
    "we compared their wise luminosity at @xmath390 m ( observed frame , a wavelength range where a powerful qso is expected to dominate over the host galaxy emission ) with the @xmath177 , derived from an optical / uv sed modelling ( an approach that does not include the ir emission ; * ? ? ?",
    "we found that in these high - luminosity unabsorbed qsos the bolometric luminosity and the w3 luminosity are well - correlated over @xmath189dex .",
    "the best - fitting relation has been then applied to the xqso2s , adopting as w3 luminosity the value derived from the nuclear component after correcting for the estimated absorption .",
    "the main results of our work can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "being the unabsorbed population in the xbs previously analysed @xcite , we could compare the two samples of xqso1s and xqso2s , looking for possible statistically significant differences .",
    "we found that x - ray - selected absorbed and unabsorbed qsos share the same intrinsic properties ( @xmath66 , @xmath177 , @xmath391 , @xmath148 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the wise - based @xmath177 have been compared with the ir - based @xmath177 , derived from the intrinsic ( i.e. , absorption - corrected ) @xmath392 as computed from the sed modelling .",
    "we found a good agreement between the two estimates .",
    "we conclude that the absorbed ad unabsorbed qsos in the xbs sample have similar observed torus - reprocessed luminosity - to - bolometric luminosity ratio .",
    "the xqso2s analysed here populate the proposed `` forbidden region '' in the @xmath393 vs. @xmath5 diagram .",
    "this result could imply a grain abundance much lower than in the local ism or the presence of stars inwards of the obscuring material with mass comparable to the mass of the bh .",
    "in addition , we propose that the anisotropy in the nuclear emission can also play a significant role .    in conclusion , our work suggests that the hypothesis of different evolutionary states for absorbed and unabsorbed qsos in addition to the basic unified model is not required , at least up to @xmath144 .",
