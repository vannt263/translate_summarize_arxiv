    "the coherent control of a single quantum emitter is a crucial element for the effective generation of single photons and even more for the generation of entanglement between the emitted photon and the radiating quantum system @xcite .",
    "it is thus of fundamental importance for future applications in quantum communication and information processing , like quantum networks @xcite or the quantum repeater @xcite .",
    "so far , a great variety of possible experimental schemes has been worked out , based upon the control of fluorescence from different kind of emitters , like ions @xcite , atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite , color centers @xcite or semiconductor structures @xcite .",
    "cold atoms - isolated from the environment by the use of standard laser cooling and trapping techniques - are outstanding candidates for future applications in quantum networking . on the one hand ,",
    "narrow - band atomic transitions can be used for the generation of single photons .",
    "on the other hand , due to the intrinsic clarity of the well defined internal level structure , atoms are also well suited for the realization of a long - lived quantum memory .",
    "in particular , a single laser cooled @xmath0rb atom , localized in a far - off - resonance optical dipole trap ( fort ) @xcite , lends itself to store quantum information in the level structure of the atomic ground state @xmath2 for a long time with a very small relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "the stored quantum information can in principle be converted to flying qubits ( photons ) at a wavelength of 780 nm - suitable for low - loss communication - and therefore be transmitted between specified remote locations . and",
    "most important , the spontaneous decay of a single @xmath0rb atom prepared in the @xmath3 hyperfine level can be used to generate entanglement between the spin state of the atom and the polarization of the emitted photon @xcite necessary for the scalable coupling of quantum memories @xcite .    in this paper , we report the observation and analysis of a single @xmath0rb atom in an optical dipole trap that operates at a detuning of 61 nm from atomic resonance .",
    "atoms stored in this fort have a very low photon scattering rate and therefore negligible photon recoil heating .",
    "confinement times up to 4 s are achieved with no additional cooling .",
    "because of the small trap volume , only a single atom can be loaded at a time @xcite . to prove this property",
    "the photon statistics of the detected fluorescence light has been studied with an hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) setup .",
    "the measured second order correlation function exhibits strong photon anti - bunching verifying the presence of a single atom in the trap .",
    "in addition the two - photon correlations show coherent dynamics of the population of the atomic hyperfine levels involved in the excitation process .",
    "the observed correlations can not be explained by the simple model of a two - level atom @xcite . in order to simulate the second - order correlation function of the measured fluorescence light",
    ", we numerically solve optical bloch equations based on a four - level model . within experimental errors",
    "we find good agreement of the theoretical predictions with the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the spectral properties of the emitted photons with a scanning fabry - perot interferometer ( fpi ) . due to the doppler effect",
    "we observe a broadening of the rayleigh scattered atomic fluorescence spectrum relative to the spectral distribution of the exciting laser light field .",
    "this broadening allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the trapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 @xmath1k .",
    "in our experiment the fort is generated by a gaussian laser beam of a single mode laser diode at a wavelength of 856 nm , which is focused down with a microscope objective ( located outside the vacuum chamber ) to a waist of @xmath4 @xmath1 m ( see fig . [",
    "bild : setup ] ) . for a laser power of 44 mw",
    "we calculate a trap depth of 1 mk and a photon scattering rate of 24 s@xmath5 @xcite . in order to load atoms into this fort ,",
    "we start with a cloud of laser cooled atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite .",
    "the mot is loaded from the thermal rubidium background gas produced by a dispenser operating slightly above threshold ( residual gas pressure below 10@xmath6 mbar ) .",
    "this provides a macroscopic reservoir of cold atoms with a typical temperature on the order of 100 @xmath1k .",
    "the dipole trap overlaps with the mot and thus by changing the magnetic field gradient of the mot we can adjust the loading rate of atoms into the dipole trap from 0.2 s@xmath5 , without quadrupole field , up to 1 atom per second at a magnetic field gradient of 1 g / cm . to assure optimal conditions for laser cooling in the dipole trap , the magnetic field is compensated below a residual value of 300 mg by three orthogonal pairs of helmholtz coils generating a suitable bias field .",
    "the fluorescence light scattered by atoms in the dipole trap region is collected with the focusing objective and separated from the trapping beam with a dichroic mirror .",
    "then it is coupled into a single mode optical fiber for spatial filtering and detected with a silicon avalanche photodiode ( apd ) . in this way it is possible to suppress",
    "stray light from specular reflections of the cooling beams and fluorescence light from atoms outside the dipole trap .    to load a single atom into the fort , we switch on the cooling and repump laser of the mot and measure the fluorescence counting rate from the dipole trap . if a cold atom enters the trap we observe an increase of the detected fluorescence count rate .",
    "typical photon counting rates are 500 - 1800 s@xmath5 per atom depending on the detuning and intensity of the cooling laser . from the overlap of the detection beam ( waist : @xmath7 @xmath1 m ) with the emission characteristics of the emitted atomic fluorescence we calculate an overall detection efficiency for single photons of 0.1 @xmath8 including transmission losses and the quantum efficiency of our si - apd .",
    "the fluorescence rate exhibits the typical telegraph - signal structure ( see fig . [ bild : singleatomtrace ] ) jumping between background intensity ( 450 s@xmath5 ) when no atom is in the trap and a defined intensity level ( 2250 s@xmath5 ) corresponding to one atom .",
    "other fluorescence intensities have hardly been observed .",
    "this effect is caused by light - induced two - body collisions , that together with the small dipole trap volume give rise to a blockade mechanism which assures that only a single atom is trapped per time . if a second atom enters the trap , inelastic two - body collisions @xcite lead to an immediate loss of both atoms @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , that so far , a random telegraph signal was considered typical , when the dark phase corresponds to the same atom as the bright one does , but with the atom being shelved in a so - called dark state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , here a single atom enters and leaves the trap . from the fluorescence trace in fig . [ bild : singleatomtrace ] we determined a 1/e lifetime in presence of cooling light of @xmath9 s. the mean lifetime without cooling light is @xmath10 s. due to interaction with the far - off resonant dipole trap laser field , spontaneous raman scattering leads to a change of the population occupation of an atom initially pumped to the f=1 hyperfine ground level .",
    "this hyperfine state changing scattering rate was determined in a measurement , similar to @xcite , to 0.1 s@xmath5 for a trap depth of 0.75 mk .",
    "to assure that the upper fluorescence level corresponds to a single trapped atom , we analyzed the non - classical properties of the emitted fluorescence light .",
    "for this purpose the second order correlation function @xmath11 was measured in an hanbury - brown - twiss configuration with two detectors behind a 50:50 beam splitter ( inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ bild : hbtmessung ] ) .",
    "the differences of detection times @xmath12 of photon pair events were recorded in a storage oscilloscope with a conditional trigger mode . to minimize background contributions ,",
    "the coincidences are acquired only at times , when the fluorescence exceeded a threshold of 1200 counts per second .",
    "a normalized distribution of time differences @xmath13 is equivalent to the second order correlation function as long as @xmath13 is much smaller than the mean time difference between two detection events @xcite . for correct normalization of the measured @xmath11 we divide the coincidences in each time bin @xmath14 by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mean count rates of the two detectors , and",

    "the correlation function shows an exponential decay from the asymptotic value 1.24 around @xmath20 to 1.0 for large @xmath13 with a time constant of 1.8 @xmath1s .",
    "this effect can be explained by the diffusive atomic motion in the intensity - modulated light field of our three - dimensional cooling beam configuration and was already studied in detail by gomer et al .",
    "@xcite with a single atom in a mot .    on short timescales ,",
    "most prominently we observe an uncorrected minimum value @xmath29 at zero delay ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "taking into account accidental coincidences due to the dark count rate of 300 @xmath30 of each detector , we derive a corrected minimum value @xmath31 . within our experimental errors",
    "this is compatible with perfect photon anti - bunching of the emitted fluorescence light and therefore proves the single atom character of our dipole trap .",
    "furthermore , we observe the signature of rabi - oscillations due to the coherent interaction of the cooling and repump laser field with the atomic hyperfine levels involved in the excitation process .",
    "the oscillation frequency is in good agreement with a simple two - level model @xcite and the amplitude is damped out on the expected timescale of the @xmath32 excited state lifetime @xmath33ns@xmath34 .",
    "the correlation function of a driven two - level atom shows its maximum value @xmath35 for @xmath13 close to zero @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the background corrected correlations in fig .",
    "[ bild : hbttheory ] show larger oscillation amplitudes up to a maximum value of 5 .",
    "this increase of the oscillation amplitude - already known from experiments with single ions @xcite - is a consequence of optical pumping among the two hyperfine ground levels @xmath36 and @xmath37 . to understand the consequences of this effect on the second order correlation function in detail one has to take into account the atomic level structure involved in the excitation process .",
    "for the fluorescence detection of a single atom in our dipole trap we use the mot cooling laser ( cl ) , red detuned to the unperturbed hyperfine transition @xmath38 @xmath39 ( inset of fig . [ bild : hbttheory ] ) by @xmath40 ( @xmath41 mhz is the natural linewidth ) . to avoid optical pumping to the @xmath42 hyperfine ground level we additionally shine in a repump laser ( rl ) on resonance with the unperturbed hyperfine transition @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "because the atom is stored in a dipole trap the ac stark - effect additionally shifts the cooling and repump light fields out of resonance .",
    "this leads to significant atomic population in @xmath36 and therefore to a breakdown of the two - level assumption .    for the following calculation",
    "we assume that the repump laser excites the @xmath45 level whereas the cooling laser can excite both hyperfine levels @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these couplings are characterized by the rabi frequencies @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . because the three pairs of counter - propagating circularly polarized cooling laser beams form an intensity lattice in space and due to the finite kinetic energy of the atom corresponding to a temperature of approximately 105 @xmath1k ( see next section ) it is quite complicated to correctly describe the internal and external dynamics of the atom in the dipole trap potential . in a classical picture the atom oscillates in the trap potential with an amplitude of several optical wavelengths .",
