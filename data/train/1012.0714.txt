    "electromagnetic field enhancement in nanoplasmonic structures plays an important role in a number of applications such as nano antennas  @xcite , single - photon emitters  @xcite , and surface - enhanced spectroscopy techniques in general  @xcite , including surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers )  @xcite .",
    "field localization is the key to understanding and further enhancing the resolution of sers , and the use of highly engineered surface plasmonic structures has been envisioned  @xcite .",
    "strong field enhancement has so far been inherently connected to singularities  @xcite .",
    "it is commonplace to study the plasmonic response using maxwell s equations with the bulk dielectric function of the metal , with an abrupt change at the air - metal interface  @xcite .",
    "though clearly neglecting surface and confinement effects for the electrons in the metal , this is a celebrated approximation which predicts the existence of surface plasmons forming the heart of nanoplasmonics .",
    "however , when samples involve true nano - scale feature - sizes , the validity of this approximation is challenged and new phenomena , such as non - local response and spatial dispersion  @xcite and inhomogeneous electron densities due to quantum confinement  @xcite are expected to play an important role .    in nanoscale metallic structures",
    "the electrons are subject to quantum confinement , which leads to a number of spectacular effects , such as the quantized conductance of atomic quantum - point contacts  @xcite , friedel oscillations and confinement of electrons to quantum corrals on noble metal surfaces  @xcite , and a size - dependent structure of nanocrystals  @xcite .",
    "light emission from stm has been used to reveal plasmonic properties of electrons confined to triangular islands on surfaces of noble metals  @xcite .",
    "all these studies clearly show that , at least at low temperatures , quantum confinement plays an important role leading to inhomogeneous electron densities at interfaces that differ from the piecewise constant bulk values .",
    "the qualitative optical consequences of an inhomogeneous electron density can be explored within lindhard s _ `` local density approximation '' _ for the dielectric function  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 accounts for the density variations relative to the bulk density of electrons @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the bulk plasma frequency . to mimic the ohmic damping we have included a damping rate @xmath4 and in the optical regime @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "while several studies have considered the consequences of local density variations for the surface - plasmon dispersion relation , the overall effects have been reported to be minor and for planar surfaces the surface - plasmon resonance at @xmath6 appears unaffected by the detailed density profile at the metal - air surface  @xcite .",
    "however , it remains an open question to which extent the detailed field distribution will be affected by a smoothly varying electron density in contrast to the discontinuous drop in the electron density assumed by the bulk approximation .",
    "zero - index phenomena in metamaterials are receiving increasing attention  @xcite , and the recent results by litchinitser _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show that for a metamaterial with the effective constitutive coefficients varying linearly , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a pronounced field enhancement will occur at @xmath9 where @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we show that plasmonic structures employing nature s own metals may support large field enhancement at the zero-@xmath11 surface appearing in the vicinity of the air - metal interface , where the real part of the polarization of the dilute electron gas will exactly balance the polarization of the vacuum background .",
    "as shown below , the particular position of the zero-@xmath11 surface depends on the frequency @xmath12 of the incident radiation , and may be either in air or in the metal , depending on the local geometry .",
    "the basic mechanism behind the field enhancement can be understood from the continuity condition for the electrical displacement field , which stipulates that @xmath13 be continuous ( here @xmath14 is the normal vector of a surface element ) . at the zero-@xmath11 surface the normal component @xmath15 thus has to diverge to keep the product @xmath16 finite .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindhard ] ) it follows that in the regions where @xmath17 vanishes , there will still be a small , but finite imaginary part : @xmath18 . for an electrical field",
    "@xmath19 incident at an angle @xmath20 we thus expect that the normal component @xmath21 is enhanced by a factor proportional to @xmath22 on the zero-@xmath11 surface .",
    "the intensity enhancement can then be estimated as @xmath23 we emphasize that this mechanism of field - enhancement is generic and robust as it only depends on the assumed continuous negative - to - positive variation of the dielectric function at the metal - air interface , in combination with a maxwell boundary condition  @xcite , rather than on the details of the excitation of strongly localized surface - plasmon resonances with pronounced sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "the low - temperature density profile for jellium is a function of @xmath24 only , with the radius of the free - electron sphere @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the bohr radius . the position - dependent electron density may be obtained self - consistently with the aid of density - functional theory  @xcite , thus taking into account both exchange and correlation effects in the inhomogeneous electron gas . in ref .",
    "@xcite , results are tabulated for a range of values of @xmath24 . the resulting density @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) for @xmath28 , a typical value for gold or silver . as seen",
    ", @xmath29 varies continuously on the length scale of the fermi wavelength rather than exhibiting a discontinuous drop at the surface of the metal ( @xmath9 ) . in the metal ( @xmath30 )",
    ", there are friedel oscillations near the surface , while for @xmath31 the decay of the density is caused by the finite value of the work function @xmath32 , which allows electron wave functions to penetrate into the classically forbidden region . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindhard ] ) , the dielectric function will inherit the friedel oscillations in the metal , as well as approach the value in vacuum outside the metal surface . as a consequence ,",
    "the dielectric function passes through zero just outside the metal surface [ green line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "similar spatial variations of the dielectric function have been reported in more elaborate studies of e.g. semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite and recently also in doped semiconductors  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath33",
    "the zero-@xmath11 surface appears at a distance of 0.25  nm from the surface ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "[ fig1](b ) illustrates the field enhancement in the case of a plane wave incident at an angle of @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical results were obtained by solving the wave equation @xmath35 with the aid of a finite - element method employing an adaptive mesh algorithm ( comsol multiphysics ) . a comparison with @xmath36 in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ( a ) shows that the field enhancement indeed occurs at the point where @xmath37 .",
    "we emphasize that this phenomenon has no counterpart within the classical bulk approximation of the dielectric function . for a realistic value of the damping ( @xmath38 ) the intensity",
    "may be enhanced by more than 3 orders of magnitude , which suggests that in a sers experiment the raman signal could be enhanced by 6 orders of magnitude  @xcite without the need for any geometry - induced localized resonances . to further test the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) we have explored the dependence on the angle of incidence as well as the particular value of the plasmon damping .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) illustrates how the peak height depends on damping .",
    "the enhancement is limited by the plasmonic damping with the slope of the dashed lines being in full accordance with the power ( -2 ) of @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "panel ( b ) illustrates the angle dependence with the dashed line showing the @xmath39 dependence of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , indicating a pronounced enhancement for oblique incidence .",
    "we next explore the field enhancement in the presence of strong confinement of electrons in metallic nanostructures . here",
    "we limit ourselves to a model of non - interacting electrons in wire geometries with nanoscale cross sections @xmath40 so that the problem effectively is two - dimensional .",
    "the energy states of the electron system are then given by @xmath41 with the transverse energy components being quantized and governed by a two - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath42\\psi_\\nu(x , y)={\\mathscr e}_\\nu\\psi_\\nu(x , y).\\ ] ] for the confinement potential @xmath43 we adjust the height in accordance with the work function of the metal @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the chemical potential .",
    "in equilibrium the states are populated according to the fermi ",
    "dirac distribution function and we find @xmath46 where @xmath47 is area and @xmath48 $ ] with @xmath49 being jonquire s polylogarithm function .",
    "equilateral triangular nano islands have been the subject of numerous investigations  @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we consider field enhancement in such a structure .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows results within the bulk approximation , where an artificial rounding of the corners has been added to circumvent the effect of an otherwise divergent electrical field  @xcite .",
    "clearly , field enhancement is modest since no pronounced surface plasmon resonances are excited .",
    "[ fig3](b ) on the other hand is based on the spatially continuously varying dielectric function of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lindhard ] ) and ( [ eq : jonquiere ] ) and shows a pronounced field enhancement along the zero-@xmath11 surface .",
    "we also note that while the geometry has arbitrarily sharp corners , the electron density and dielectric function themselves are still smooth , showing that quantum confinement provides a built - in smoothing even in the presence of sharp geometrical features .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) show in more detail the field enhancement along the lines indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . for the results in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the peak height clearly matches the one - dimensional results in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for an incident angle of @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , the result within the bulk approximation resembles typical results , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. the field enhancement is more modest . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , the incident wave propagates almost parallel to the zero-@xmath11 surface ( @xmath51 ) , thus causing a peak that is even higher at the two right - most corners of the triangle . on the other hand , at the left - most corner",
    "the wave has normal impact on the zero-@xmath11 surface ( @xmath52 ) so that no pronounced field enhancement is observed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the enhancement may occur either outside [ as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] or inside [ as in fig .  [",
    "fig3](b ) ] the metal , depending on the local geometry and the frequency relative to the plasma frequency .",
    "we predict that a large non - resonant field enhancement may occur at zero - epsilon surfaces near the air - metal interface .",
    "theoretically , the enhancement occurs in a wide class of models where the discontinuous jump of the dielectric function of the usual bulk description of at an air - metal interface is replaced by a continuous function @xmath53 that has the bulk values as limiting values away from the interface .",
    "we discussed two microscopic models for such a continuous variation at the interface .",
    "the predicted field enhancement has therefore no counterpart in the classical bulk treatment of plasmonic field enhancement , though it is intimately related to the familiar boundary condition for the electrical displacement field .",
    "in particular , for light impinging on an interface we discussed the dependence of the field enhancement on the angle of incoming light and on the damping in the metal . furthermore , the enhancement constitutes another mechanism for the enhancement of raman signals at metal interfaces ( sers ) .",
    "interestingly , feigenbaum _ et al .",
    "_ have recently reported their experimental observation of zero - index driven field enhancement at the surface of conducting oxides ( i.e. with lower electron density compared to good metals )  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the decay of the electron density into vacuum ( or more generally into a dielectric ) could have important implications also for nano - gap structures ( such as the gap formed between the corners of two nearby triangles  @xcite ) , where quantum tunneling of electrons will introduce a small but finite electron density inside the gap , thus also modifying the local dielectric function and the ability to support short - circuiting currents  @xcite .",
