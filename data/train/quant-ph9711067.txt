    "the detrimental effect of loss is a serious problem for optical communications based on transmission of nonclassical states of radiation .",
    "it is well - known that the results for the lossless case @xcite rapidly do not hold anymore for increasing losses @xcite . as a matter of fact , as shown in this paper , the `` nonclassical '' channels based on direct detection of number states and homodyning of squeezed states ",
    "channels that have been originally proposed in order to improve the capacity of the `` classical '' channel based on heterodyning of coherent states  both are much more sensitive to loss than the classical channel .",
    "they also have been shown @xcite to be easily degraded by additive gaussian noise , which models any kind of environmental effect due to linear interactions with random fields .",
    "hence , for long haul communications the great advantage of using nonclassical states is completely lost , since a minimum loss of 0.3db / km is unavoidable with the current optical - fiber technology . in the above scenario",
    "the optimization of the quantum channel in the presence of loss is the most relevant issue for achieving reliable communication schemes in practical situations .    through a systematic approach ,",
    "in this paper we evaluate the optimal _ a priori _ probability in the presence of loss , for both the squeezed - state and the number - state channels , and compare the relative effectiveness in terms of mutual information .",
    "although for sufficiently high average transmitted power even the optimized channels are anyway beaten by the heterodyne one , at low power levels the enhancement of the mutual information from optimization makes both nonclassical channels more effective than the heterodyne one . as we will see in the following , such improvement of the nonclassical channels is even more dramatic for very strong attenuation and gives rise to unexpected results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we introduce the master equation that models the effect of loss , and we shortly review the heterodyne channel . due to the peculiar form of the master equation  which keeps coherent states as coherent  in the presence of loss there is no need for optimization of the _ a priori _ probability , whereas the channel capacity only depends on the average photon number at the receiver . in sect .",
    "iii the optimal _ a priori _ probability for the squeezed - state channel is derived analytically .",
    "we show that the optimal fraction of squeezing photons rapidly decreases with loss , with a relative improvement of the mutual information up to 30 % at low power for @xmath2 . for total mean photon number @xmath3 the optimized squeezed - state channel beats the coherent - state one at any value of the loss .",
    "following hall @xcite , we also provide a general upper bound valid for any lossy channel that uses homodyne detection , a bound that , however , is never achieved by our optimized squeezed - state channel .",
    "iv is devoted to the optimization of the number - state channel . using the recursive blahut s algorithm @xcite ,",
    "we obtain an optimized _ a priori _ probability that departs from the usual monotonically - decreasing thermal - like behavior , and that , for attenuation @xmath1 , develops gaps of zero probability at intermediate numbers of photons .",
    "an intuitive explanation of this result can be understood as the effect of a loss so strong that it becomes more convenient to use a smaller alphabet of well - spaced letters in order to achieve a better distinguishability at the receiver .",
    "the sizeable improvement of the mutual information  over 70 % for high attenuation at low power  partially stems the detrimental effect of loss . in sect . v",
    "the main conclusions are drawn .",
    "the paper is accompanied by many optimality capacity diagrams ( figs .",

    "the communication channel based on heterodyne detection encodes a complex variable on a coherent state with gaussian _ a priori _ distribution .",
    "the heterodyne 3db detection noise is itself gaussian additive , and the gaussian form of the _ a priori _ probability density that achieves the channel capacity is dictated by the shannon s theorem@xcite for gaussian channels subjected to the quadratic constraint of fixed average power . under such constraint",
    "the variance of the optimal gaussian distribution equals the value of the mean photon number @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we briefly redraw the analytical derivation of this result , in order to show how the optimal _ a priori _ probability remains unchanged in the presence of loss .",
    "the effect of loss on a single - mode communication channel is determined by the master equation @xmath5\\hat\\varrho + \\gamma n_a l[a^{\\dag}]\\hat\\varrho \\simeq \\gamma l[a]\\hat\\varrho   \\;,\\label{loss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superoperator @xmath6 gives the time derivative of the density matrix @xmath7 of the radiation state ( in the interaction picture ) through the action of the lindblad superoperators @xmath8\\hat\\varrho = a\\hat\\varrho a^{\\dag}-{1\\over 2 }   ( a^{\\dag}a\\hat\\varrho+\\hat\\varrho a^{\\dag}a)$ ] @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath9 represents the damping rate , whereas @xmath10 denotes the mean number of thermal photons at the frequency of mode @xmath11 , and can be neglected at optical frequencies .",
    "we introduce the energy attenuation factor , or `` loss '' , defined as follows @xmath12 according to the evolution of the average power @xmath13 = \\hbox{tr}[a^{\\dag } a \\,e^{{\\cal l}_{\\gamma}t}\\hat\\varrho ( 0)]=\\eta\\langle a^{\\dag } a ( 0)\\rangle \\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more generally , @xmath14 gives the scaling factor of any normal - ordered operator function , namely @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the dual liouvillian , which is defined through the identity @xmath17 = \\mbox{tr}\\left[\\hat o ( e^{{\\cal l}_{\\gamma}t}\\hat\\varrho ) \\right ]   \\ ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] valid for any operator @xmath18 .",
