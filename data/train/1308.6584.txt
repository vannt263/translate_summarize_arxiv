    "galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) represent a key ingredient for the understanding of the evolution of the galaxy , both from a chemical and a stellar populations perspective . in particular , they represent the oldest systems in the milky way , and their relative ages accordingly play an important role in constraining the galaxy s formation timescale ( e.g. , salaris & weiss 2002 ; marn - franch et al . 2009 ; dotter et al .",
    "a major advantage encountered in the study of gcs is the frequent presence of large rr lyrae populations , which are of great interest due to several properties , including a relative narrow range in magnitude ( which makes them excellent standard candles to determine distances ) and also the presence of correlations between their pulsation properties and the properties of the gcs to which they belong ( see , e.g. , zorotovic et al .",
    "2010 and cohen et al .",
    "2011 , for some recent examples ) .",
    "another remarkable characteristic of the rr lyrae stars in gcs is the oosterhoff dichotomy ( oosterhoff 1939 , 1944 ) , which consists in the sharp division of the ggc system into two groups , according to the average period of their ab - type ( i.e. , fundamental - mode ) rr lyrae population : oosterhoff type i ( ooi ) , with @xmath3  d , and oosterhoff type ii ( ooii ) , with @xmath4  d. this dichotomous behavior applies exclusive to galactic globulars , since nearby extragalactic systems somehow preferentially occupy a period range that is intermediate between groups ooi and ooii ( catelan 2009 ; catelan et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this sense",
    ", the oosterhoff dichotomy provides important information that must be taken into account , when studying the early formation history of the milky way and its dwarf satellite galaxy system . in this context , obtaining a complete census of variability in ggcs is especially important , for it may help identify outliers in the oosterhoff dichotomy context , and hence potentially point to gcs of extragalactic origin .    perhaps surprisingly , after more than a century of ggc variability studies , there is still a large number of gcs which lack time - series analyses , particularly using modern techniques . in this sense , the advent of ccd detectors , combined with sophisticated crowded - field photometry and image subtraction techniques ( e.g. , stetson 1987 , 1994 ; alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ; bramich 2008 ) has proven of key importance for unveiling the presence of large numbers of previously unknown variable stars in gcs , particularly in their crowded cores .        according to the dec .",

    "very recently , bramich et al .",
    "( 2011 ) published the results of time - series imaging of this cluster , performed with difference imaging , and updated the cluster s variable star census . in the framework of our long - term project to complete the census of variable stars in ggcs ( catelan et al .",
    "2006 ) , and with the advantage of a longer time - baseline based on archival and new images , we have revisited the variability content of .",
    "importantly , with the large number of images used and a large field of view ( fov ) , we were able to obtain a much deeper , spatially resolved , high - precision cmd , which allowed us to study several properties of the cluster , including its surface brightness profile and the presence of extratidal stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] our data and data analysis techniques are described . in section  [ sec : extratidal ] we analyze the structural parameters of the cluster .",
    "section  [ sec : cmd ] provides our analysis of the different branches of the cmd . in section  [ sec : age ] , we compare our results with another well - studied gc of similar metallicity , namely m3 ( ngc  5272 ) , in order to position m72 in a relative age scale , compared with other ggcs . in section  [ sec : variables ] , we discuss our findings regarding the cluster s variable star population . we close in section  [ sec : conclu ] with a summary of our results",

    "the observational material for this study consists of 1,139 individual ccd images from 18 observing runs .",
    "these images are contained within a data archive maintained by pbs , and include   among others   images obtained specifically for this project .",
    "notable among these is one series of exposures dating from 2007 april 7 through 2007 august 3 : observations were taken on 42 of these 110 nights , with no gap greater than eight nights .",
    "summary details of the 18 observing runs are given in table 1 .",
    "considering all these images together , the median seeing for our observations was 1.4 arcseconds ; the 25th and 75th percentiles were 1.2 and 1.6 arcseconds ; the 10th and 90th percentiles were 1.0 and 1.8 arcseconds .",
    "the photometric reductions were all carried out by pbs using standard daophot / allframe procedures ( stetson 1987 , 1994 ) to perform profile - fitting photometry , which was then referred to a system of synthetic - aperture photometry by the method of growth - curve analysis ( stetson 1990 ) .",
    "calibration of these instrumental data to the photometric system of landolt ( 1992 ; see also landolt 1973 , 1983 ) was carried out as described by stetson ( 2000 , 2005 ) .",
    "if we define a `` dataset '' as the accumulated observations from one ccd chip on one night with photometric observing conditions , or one chip on one or more nights during a single observing run with non - photometric conditions , the data for m72 were contained within 83 different datasets , each of which was individually calibrated to the landolt system . of these 83 datasets ,",
    "60 were obtained and calibrated as `` photometric , '' meaning that photometric zero points , color transformations , and extinction corrections were derived from all standard fields observed during the course of each night , and were applied to the m72 observations .",
    "the other 23 datasets were reduced as `` non - photometric '' ; in this case , color transformations were derived from all the standard fields observed during the course of the observing run , but the photometric zero point of each individual ccd image was derived from local m72 photometric standards contained within the image itself .",
    "the different cameras employed projected to different areas on the sky , and of course the telescope pointings differed among the various exposures .",
    "the wfi , wfc , mosaic2 , and emmi imagers , in particular , consist of mosaics of non - overlapping ccd detectors . therefore , although we have 1,139 images , clearly no individual star appears in all those images .",
    "in fact , no star appeared in more than 169 @xmath11-band images , 200 @xmath12 images , or 190 @xmath14 images .",
    "considering the entire area surveyed , the _ median _",
    "number of observations for one of our stars is 13 in @xmath11 , 34 in @xmath12 , and 35 in @xmath14 . in the immediate vicinity of the cluster ( within a radius of order 7 arcminutes ) , however , most stars appeared in at least 100 images in each of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 .",
    "there were insufficient @xmath10- and @xmath13-band images to define local standards in the m72 field , so we have not calibrated the @xmath10 or @xmath13 data and make no use of them here .",
    "in addition , during the 2008 august observing run on the ctio blanco 4 m telescope , three exposures ( 24 individual ccd images ) were obtained in a ddo51 filter .",
    "this bandpass measures the strength of a molecular band of mgh and the `` b '' triplet lines of neutral magnesium , and can be used as a gravity / metallicity discriminator in very cool stars to distinguish likely member giants from foreground field dwarfs .",
    "while we do not employ the ddo51 data in the current investigation , we may revisit these data in a future study .",
    "still , even though we do not make use of the @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and ddo51 data in our photometric analysis , these images were included in the allframe reductions for the additional information they give on the completeness of the star list and the precision of the astrometry .",

    "2011 , hereafter w11 ; correnti et al . 2011 ; carballo - bello et al . 2012 ; salinas et al .",
    "this result is not entirely surprising , for two main reasons .",
    "first , the number of wide - field ccd observations of ggcs has increased dramatically since the classical studies dealing with the structural parameters of these objects were published ( e.g. , grillmair et al .",
    "second , clusters are expected to undergo tidal disruption in the course of their lives , due to their interactions with the galaxy as they orbit in the halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and direct evidence for this is being increasingly found in many ggcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , there is growing evidence that many ggcs may indeed have been much more massive in the past , some possibly being the remains of disrupted dwarf galaxies acting as building blocks in the hierarchical scenarios for galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to study the structural parameters of and to find the level of contamination by field stars , we followed the method described in w11 , which is based on a similar dataset , and with a large fov that extends more than 30  from the cluster center .",
    "first , we identify an _ acceptance box _ in the @xmath20 , @xmath12 plane , as shown in figure  [ accbox ] .",
    "we used the @xmath20 , @xmath12 plane , as suggested by w11 , because of its stronger sensitivity to temperature , allowing a more robust determination of the ridgeline ( more details on the ridgeline construction are given in sect .",

    "the contamination from field stars inside the box is small but not negligible .",
    "we did not include in the acceptance box the blue straggler star ( bss ) population , since they will have a very small effect in the estimation of overall number counts in the cluster , and certainly will not affect the outer radii , due to its mostly central concentration .",
    "more details on the bss population are given in section  [ sec : bss ] .",
    "once the acceptance box has been defined , the field is divided in concentric annuli , each with a radius of 50 , in order to study the radial density profile inside and outside the acceptance box .",
    "since the cluster is not centered in the fov , the limit radius considered to be complete is the greatest circle within the fov , this is @xmath31 , which corresponds to the edge closer to the center of the cluster .    in figure  [ surfdensfield ] ( _ top panel _ )",
    "is plotted the logarithmic surface density of all stars outside the acceptance box , as a function of the inverse of the radial distance .",
    "based on the assumption that in the outermost annuli the presence of true cluster members is negligible , it follows that the mean density value of the last points provides a reasonable estimate of the surface density of field stars outside the acceptance box .",
    "this leads to an estimated field contribution of @xmath32 .",
    "we then calculated the fraction of stars inside and outside the box .",
    "in this case , the fraction of counts in each case is not affected by incompleteness of the sample at radii greater of @xmath2 , so we extended the annuli to the complete fov .",
    "this fraction is shown in figure  [ surfdensfield ] ( _ middle panel _ ) . the asymptotic value ( at larger distances ) of the logarithm of this fraction approaches @xmath33 .",
    "combining this number with the surface density of field stars outside the box , we obtain that the surface density of field stars is @xmath34 , comprised of @xmath32 outside the box and @xmath35 inside the box .",

    "1995 , and @xmath41 is the limit of our study . figure  [ radii ] shows that there is still a trace of ( mostly main sequence , ms ) stars belonging to the cluster at radial distances further than @xmath37 and even further than @xmath40 .",

    "they conclude that these stars are probably unbound due to ongoing stripping episodes ; furthermore , they speculate that gcs may not have an observable limiting radii .",

    "the presence of field stars and background galaxies is clear , especially in the zone occupied by red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and the redder and fainter part of the cmd . to produce a tighter cmd , we applied standard selection criteria used before in similar studies based on allframe photometry ( see stetson et al .",
    "the initial cut was to consider stars with @xmath44 0.1 .",
    "stars with values @xmath45 larger than 0.1  mag are mostly very faint stars ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we then used the allframe index ` sharp ` , which gives an estimate of the residuals from the psf fit .",
    "we selected stars with @xmath47 , which removed the contamination due mostly to background galaxies and very poorly measured stars . in order to obtain an accurate ridgeline and to study the more evolved populations , we applied one more cut , based on the radial distance of the stars from the cluster center ( e.g. , stetson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ vradius ] shows the distribution in magnitude of stars as a function of radial distance .",
    "the upper plot shows stars with @xmath48 , whereas the lower panel shows those with @xmath49 . for the sake of clarity , we have marked in the upper plot the limits at @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "this figure suggests that the detection limit for stars with good photometry within the magnitude range @xmath53 is at a radius of @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , we can consider that the detection limit for stars with @xmath55 is constant from radii greater than @xmath56 until @xmath57 , where there appears to be a break before field contamination increases at fainter magnitudes .",
    "we summarize all these considerations by applying the following radial selection criteria :    @xmath58    we remark that , as stated in the previous section , the limit of @xmath59 does not correspond to the cluster s tidal limit , and it is used only for the purpose of obtaining a cleaner cmd .    in figure  [ bvi ]",

    "the reason for this discrepancy is unknown ; however , we note that the coordinates provided in our work match reasonably well those provided by b11 .",
    "to avoid confusion regarding the variable census , we kept their catalog identification for this variable .      * v27 and v35 : * these variables were detected by dickens & flinn ( 1972 ) , being originally classified as ab - type rr lyrae ; however , in the study of b11 they appeared out of their fov , so even though they include them in their final catalog , no new periods could be determined .",

    "* v38 and v42 : * according to b11 , sawyer ( 1953 ) and dickens & flinn ( 1972 ) discovered that these stars were variable , but they were unable to provide a light curve because v38 is in the proximity of a saturated star , and v42 was itself saturated . in our analysis , v38 shows no sign of variability . in the case of v42",

    "such short periods for bright rgb stars are quite unusual . the proximity of the period to 1  d renders the derived period suspicious . on the other hand , barring saturation effects , the variability amplitude , of order 0.5  mag in @xmath11 , 0.3  mag in @xmath12 , and 0.2  mag in @xmath14 , seems quite significant .",
    "* v39 : * this star shows no variability in b11 , mostly due to outlier photometric measurements . in this study , we found evidence of variability , and its light curve was phased with a period of 0.426785  d. the morphology of the light curve suggests a rrab classification .",
    "the blazhko ( 1907 ) effect might also be present .",
    "however we note that the star is fainter than the bulk of the cluster s rr lyrae population , with @xmath596 .",

    "* v51 : * b11 listed a period of 0.357335  d , although they noted that the period is not reliable due to poor phase coverage and blending .",
    "in fact , the light curve they provided does not show the maximum . here",
    "we provide a more reliable period of 0.548599  d , and our well - sampled light curve is shown in figure  [ figvar2 ] .",
    "the number of sx phe stars in gcs has increased markedly in recent years .",
    "these variables are of particular interest because they are located in the bss zone in the cmd .",
    "recently , cohen & sarajedini ( 2012 ) compiled an updated sx phe stars catalog in gcs , establishing a period - luminosity relation for the sample . in the future",
    ", it is hoped that the pulsation properties of sx phe stars will help understand bss formation and evolution .    in our study",
    ", we have recovered all 3 sx phe stars found in b11 .",
    "using period04 ( lenz & breger 2005 ) to analyze the fourier diagrams , the periods found correspond to the frequency of the largest amplitude oscillation , and the pulsation mode could not be identified in two cases , v55 and v56 , with @xmath12 amplitudes of 0.22 and 0.08  mag , respectively .",
    "since there are no non - radial pulsators with @xmath597 ( cohen & sarajedini 2012 ) , v55 is likely a radial pulsator .",
    "however , the argument does not go in the other direction : double radial - mode pulsators may have @xmath598 , and even some fundamental - mode sx phe may have small amplitudes . in the case of v54 , we detected two significant frequencies , with a ratio of @xmath599 , which are likely to correspond to the fundamental mode ( @xmath600 ) and the first radial overtone ( @xmath601 ; olech et al .",
    "this result is consistent with what b11 found for these stars .",
    "the periods of v54 and v56 are slightly different from b11 , while for v55 we obtained a good agreement ( see figures  [ figsxphe ] for the phased light curves )",
    ". it should be noted that in the case of v56 we could not phase the light curve convincingly enough , and the period may not be reliable .",
    "the amplitude found by period04 , @xmath602  0.08 , is comparable with the error in the photometry . to close",
    ", we note that v54 appears to be slightly brighter than the limits of the bss region , as defined by b11 ( based on harris 1993 ) .",
    "we present the most comprehensive study of the cmd and variable star content of the ggc to date , based on new and archival @xmath0 ccd images .",
    "our cmd reaches almost four magnitudes below the turn - off level , which allowed us to conclude that m72 has the same age as m3 ( which has a similar metallicity and hb morphology ) , to within the errors .",
    "based on the measured rgb color and slope , we infer that the cluster has a metallicity @xmath1 } \\simeq -1.50 $ ] in the new uves scale .",
    "we firmly detect the cluster s blue straggler population , which is found to be more centrally concentrated than the rgb component .",
    "we also find evidence of extratidal cluster stars being present out to @xmath2 , or about twice m72 s tidal radius , and speculate that tidal tails associated with the cluster may exist .",
