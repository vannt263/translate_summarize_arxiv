    "rf - torsion is the first algebraic - topological invariant which can distinguish the homeomorphism types of homotopy - equivalent lens spaces known at that time ( cf .",

    "ray and singer @xcite introduced what we now call ray - singer analytic torsion associated to de rham complex twisted by a flat vector bundle @xmath1 over a compact oriented riemannian manifold @xmath2 .",
    "they constructed this new analytic invariant in term of the zeta function for hodge laplacian , and they conjectured that rf - torsion and the analytic torsion should be equivalent for unitary representations .",
    "this conjecture was proved by cheeger @xcite and mller @xcite independently by using different methods . in 1992",
    "bismut and zhang @xcite and mller @xcite simultaneously considered its generalizations .",
    "mller extended his result to the case where the dimension of the manifold is odd and only the metric induced on @xmath3 is required to be flat .",
    "bismut and zhang generalized the original cheeger - mller theorem to arbitrary flat vector bundles with arbitrary hermitian metrics .",
    "there are also various extensions to the equivariant case ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , bismut and zhang @xcite extended their results in @xcite to the equivariant situation .",
    "in @xcite , bismut and lott constructed what we now call bismut - lott torsion form ( bl - torsion ) for smooth fibrations with compact fiber as generalization of ray - singer analytic torsion , which will be discussed in detail later .",
    "inspired by the work of bismut and lott , igusa @xcite can finally complete the construction of higher rf - torsion by using the parameterized morse theory .",
    "the reader refers to the books of igusa @xcite and @xcite for more information about the higher igusa - klein torsion ( ik - torsion ) .",
    "a second version of higher rf - torsion ( dww - torsion ) was defined by dwyer , weiss and williams @xcite in the homotopy theoretical approach .",
    "bismut and goette @xcite obtained a family version of the bismut - zhang theorem under the assumption that there exists a fiberwise morse function for the fibration in question .",
    "goette @xcite , @xcite did more work towards the precise relation on bl - torsion and ik - torsion .",

    "* @xmath05 ) , igusa established the additivity formula and the transfer formula for ik - torsion .",
    "roughly speaking , the additivity formula of ik - torsion corresponds to the gluing formula of bl - torsion , and the transfer formula of ik - torsion corresponds to the functoriality of bl - torsion with respect to the composition of two submersions , which has been established by ma @xcite .",
    "the main results of igusa in @xcite were first developed and announced during the conference @xcite on the higher torsion invariants in gttingen in september 2003 . to study the gluing problem of bl - torsion",
    "was proposed as an open problem during this conference in order to clarify the relation between bl - torsion and ik - torsion .",
    "once we have established the gluing formula for bl - torsion , then it will imply basically that there exist a constant @xmath4 and a cohomology class @xmath5 such than @xmath6 , when they are well - defined as cohomology classes .",
