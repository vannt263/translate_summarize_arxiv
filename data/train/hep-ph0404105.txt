    "in the last few years , a new partial resolution of the hierarchy problem in particle physics has been proposed .",
    "this proposal , known as _ the little higgs _",
    "mechanism  @xcite , introduces new symmetries at the tev scale , preventing the quadratic running of coupling constants and postponing the hierarchy problem by at least an order of magnitude in energy .",
    "any potential solution to the hierarchy problem deserves serious attention and the little higgs paradigm has therefore generated a lot of interest .",
    "the basic idea is to make the electroweak higgs particle a pseudo - goldstone boson of a higher symmetry group .",
    "this construction means that quadratic divergences in the higgs mass cancel to one loop .",
    "thus , the higgs remains weakly - coupled beyond the electroweak scale , perhaps up to 10 tev .",
    "almost all work on this topic concerns the construction and phenomenological analysis of effective theories implementing the little higgs idea . in this letter",
    "we adopt a different approach and focus on the nonperturbative structures that may be present in specific little higgs models .",
    "each little higgs model introduces a new symmetry group at the tev scale .",
    "some of the new symmetries are local and some global and the group is spontaneously broken down to that of the standard model at electroweak scales . for us",
    "this raises the natural question of the possible existence of topological defect solutions in the low - energy theory .",
    "there exists a wealth of literature concerning topological defects which is well summarized in  @xcite . here ,",
    "for completeness , we merely provide a lightning review of the main concepts necessary for the analysis we perform in the rest of the paper .",
    "consider a field theory described by a continuous symmetry group @xmath1 which is spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath2 .",
    "the space of all accessible vacua of the theory , the _ vacuum manifold _ , is defined to be the space of cosets of @xmath3 in @xmath1 ; @xmath4 .    in general , the theory possesses a topological defect if some homotopy group @xmath5 is nontrivial , where , in particular , @xmath6 lead to domain walls , cosmic strings , monopoles or textures respectively .",
    "applying these conditions to the electroweak theory , a particularly useful example here , the vacuum manifold is the space of cosets @xmath7/z_2 \\right \\}/u(1)_q \\ , \\ ] ] which is topologically equivalent to the three - sphere , @xmath8 , with vanishing zeroth , first and second homotopy groups .",
    "thus , the electroweak model does not lead to walls , strings , or free magnetic monopoles .",
    "it does however , lead to texture , which exists because @xmath9 is nontrivial .",
    "it also contains confined magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "further , while the topological structure of the models may be of intrinsic particle physics interest , when one considers such models in the context of the expanding , cooling universe , the possibility of the cosmic creation of topological relics of the little higgs phase is raised .",
    "such structures may serve three possible purposes .",
    "they may , of course , have no observable consequences in today s universe .",
    "alternatively , they may yield specific observable signatures and indeed may even aid in the resolution of some cosmological problems .",
    "finally , in the most extreme case , it is possible that topological remnants of the little higgs phase may predict a cosmological catastrophe , which may be used to bound specific models .",
    "historically these considerations were considered natural in the case of new symmetry groups at the grand unified scale and can have interesting effects  @xcite in the presence of the other approach to the hierarchy problem - supersymmetry . here",
    "we initiate an analogous program of study for the little higgs paradigm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : littlest ] we consider as a prototypical example the _ littlest higgs _ model and describe its symmetry groups . in section  [ structure ]",
    "we examine in detail the symmetry breaking structure and in section  [ sec : topdef ] we identify the topological and embedded defects that result .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and comment on the possible cosmological consequences of the topological aspects of the little higgs models .",
    "we consider the  littlest higgs \" model @xcite .",
    "the model is constructed by starting with a purely global @xmath10 theory for a scalar field @xmath11 that is a @xmath12 symmetric , complex matrix .",
    "the transformation law for @xmath11 is @xmath13 note that @xmath14 and that @xmath11 is multiplied on the right by @xmath15 , not @xmath16 .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath11 is @xmath17               -v(\\sigma ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 where @xmath19 has dimensions of mass and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "the full global symmetry group of this lagrangian can be seen by noting that there is an extra set of transformations , corresponding to multiplication of @xmath11 by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a real parameter , under which @xmath24 is also invariant .",
    "modding out by the discrete set of symmetries common to both @xmath10 and to this new @xmath25  namely by the center of @xmath10  reveals the full symmetry group to be @xmath26}{z_5 } \\ .\\ ] ]    for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath11 is @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "given the above analysis of the gauge groups , the subgroup left unbroken by the above vev is then easily calculated , yielding the full symmetry breaking scheme as @xmath30}{z_5 } \\longrightarrow so(5)\\times z_2 \\ . \\label{su5xu1}\\ ] ] where the left - over @xmath0 is due to transformations with @xmath31 .",
    "in other words , the symmetry breaking is @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 model above is provided simply as a motivation for the construction of the actual model .",
    "the next step in constructing the littlest higgs model is to introduce gauge fields .",
    "however , instead of gauging the full @xmath33 only a @xmath34 subgroup is gauged .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ littlestlag ] ) becomes @xmath35-v(\\sigma )             - \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{j=1}^2 [ ( w_j^{a\\mu\\nu})^2 + ( b_j^{\\mu\\nu})^2 ] \\ , \\ ] ] where the covariant derivative is given by @xmath36 \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath37 are the coupling constants corresponding to the two @xmath38 subgroups of @xmath10 and @xmath39 are those corresponding to the two @xmath25 subgroups , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath38 and @xmath25 gauge fields .",
    "thus one has gauged a @xmath42 ^ 2 \\equiv k$ ] subgroup of @xmath10 .",
    "what remains of the global @xmath33 symmetry is merely the @xmath25 factor written explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ su5xu1 ] ) .",
    "the generators of the first @xmath38 , the second @xmath38 , the first @xmath25 and the second @xmath25 , embedded into @xmath10 , respectively are  @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the pauli spin matrices .    in this way",
    "the gauging has diminished the symmetry of the model from @xmath33 to @xmath45 where the subscript @xmath46 denotes that the symmetry is global .",
    "note that the potential of the model continues to be given by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) and still carries the full @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "this fact is important for us and we will describe its consequences more fully in the next section .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ littlestgaugelag ] ) of the little higgs model in has the peculiar feature that the symmetries of the gradient and potential terms are different . before proceeding to elaborate this feature ,",
    "let us consider the standard electroweak model where a similar feature is present .    in the electroweak model ,",
    "the potential is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the standard model higgs field and @xmath49 are its real - valued components .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath50 from which it is clear that the continuous symmetry of the potential is @xmath51 , which is isomorphic to @xmath52 , with subscripts conforming to conventional notation is often called the `` custodial '' symmetry . ] .",
    "of course , in the electroweak theory only the @xmath53 factor and a @xmath25 subgroup of the second @xmath54 factor are gauged .",
    "this diminishes the symmetry of the model to the electroweak symmetry group @xmath55/z_2 $ ] .",
    "however , since the gauging affects only the gradient terms , the potential retains the full @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "once @xmath56 gets a vev , this symmetry is spontaneously broken down to @xmath57 , while the gauged electroweak symmetry group is broken down to @xmath58 .",
    "these considerations may be summarized in the following chart @xmath59/z_2 & \\rightarrow & su(2)_{l+r }        \\cr   \\downarrow      & \\downarrow        & &     \\downarrow    \\cr { \\rm gauge : } & [ su(2)_l \\times u(1)_y]/z_2   & \\rightarrow   &   u(1)_q             \\end{array}\\ ] ]    now consider the vacuum structure of the electroweak model .",
    "@xmath60 is minimized on a three sphere , namely , @xmath61 .",
    "the manifold obtained by symmetry considerations , @xmath62/z_2\\}/u(1)_q$ ] is also three dimensional but it is important to realize that this is merely a coincidence .",
    "we shall see that in the littlest higgs model , in which a similar structure exists , such a coincidence does not occur .",
    "the electroweak model does not contain any topological defects .",
    "however , if @xmath53 is left ungauged the theory does contain stable semilocal defects  @xcite for the following reason .",
    "as above , the minimum of the potential remains an @xmath8 , on which there are special orbits that are gauged ( fig .",
    "[ ewfigure ] ) .",
    "( if there are gradients of @xmath56 along these orbits , they can be completely compensated by a gauge field . )",
    "these orbits are @xmath63 s and hence are topologically non - trivial . a field configuration that lies on such a gauge orbit can be deformed to a constant field everywhere but the deformation costs gradient energy since the configuration needs to be lifted off the orbit and contracted on the @xmath8 .",
    "if the scalar couplings are large compared to the gauge couplings , then this energy cost is large enough to stabilize the field configuration , as has been explicitly seen in the case of semilocal and electroweak strings .",
    "since the defect is stable due to an interplay between global and gauge symmetries , such defects are called semilocal cosmic strings . for the electroweak model with @xmath53 left ungauged , the electroweak semilocal string is stable provided @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the masses of the higgs scalar and the vector boson .    . if only the @xmath25 group of the electroweak symmetry group is gauged , the manifold is better viewed as the hopf fibration of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "then there are topologically non - trivial paths corresponding to orbits of the gauged @xmath25 .",
    "field configurations that lie in the gauge orbit are trivial in the full @xmath8 , yet to deform them to a trivial field configuration requires gradients that can not be compensated by the gauge field .",
    "hence the deformation costs energy and this is why topological defects corresponding to the gauged orbits can be stable even in the full model .",
    "such defects are called `` semilocal''.,width=240 ]    we now move on to the littlest higgs model . here",
    "the potential @xmath67 is invariant under the full @xmath33 group , while the lagrangian as a whole respects a @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "the potential is minimized on a @xmath68 dimensional manifold @xmath69 .",
    "however , the vacuum manifold @xmath70 corresponding to the full lagrangian is isomorphic to a coset space @xmath71 this is only a @xmath72 dimensional space . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ semilocalfigure ] , @xmath73 and so non - trivial topological features of @xmath70 need not be non - trivial in @xmath74 . therefore , in order to discuss topological defects in the model we need to ( i ) find any non - trivial topological features of @xmath70 and ( ii ) check if this non - trivial topology in @xmath70 can be trivialized in the full manifold @xmath74 . of course",
    ", if such a trivialization is not possible then the topological defect solution in @xmath70 is a genuine topological defect in the full theory .",
    "however , if the topology of the configuration is trivial in @xmath74 , then the topological defect in @xmath70 may still be a semilocal defect of the full theory and may be stable over some parameter range . as we shall now see , the littlest higgs model has both topological and semilocal strings .",
    "the chart for this model corresponding to the one shown above for the electroweak model is : @xmath75/z_5 & \\longrightarrow & so(5 ) \\times z_2     \\cr \\downarrow                            & \\downarrow      &   & \\downarrow   \\cr { \\rm gauge : }    & k \\times u(1)_{g } & \\longrightarrow &                        \\ { [ su(2)_l\\times u(1)_y ] /z_2 \\ } \\times z_2",
    "\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{su5chart}\\ ] ] where , as defined earlier , @xmath76/z_2 \\}^2 \\ .\\ ] ]",
    "for the lagrangian  ( [ littlestgaugelag ] ) the structure of the unbroken symmetry groups was best elucidated in a basis in which @xmath77 ( see the discussion below eq .",
    "( [ gglobal ] ) ) .",
    "however , at this stage it is simpler to use a different basis in which the vev is given by @xmath78 the symmetry breaking scheme is still as shown in eq .",
    "( [ su5chart ] ) and it is straightforward to check that the unbroken generators corresponding to the @xmath53 remaining after the symmetry breaking are @xmath79 ( see eq .",
    "( [ generators ] ) ) . similarly the unbroken @xmath80 has generator @xmath81 .",
    "we are now in a position to find the topological defects in the littlest higgs model .",
    "first consider the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath82 factor in the symmetry breaking .",
    "the @xmath82 factor spontaneously breaks to a @xmath0 subgroup . since @xmath83 , the group of integers under addition , it is clear that the model contains global @xmath25 strings .",
    "an appropriate ansatz for these objects is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a real profile function for the global string .",
    "similarly , in the gauged @xmath25 sector there is a cosmic string configuration corresponding to the broken @xmath25 symmetry whose generator is @xmath86 which is orthogonal to @xmath81 , the generator of @xmath80 .",
    "let us define @xmath87 then an ansatz for the string is @xmath88 where , in terms of the hypercharge gauge fields in eq .",
    "( [ covderiv ] ) , @xmath89 and @xmath90 with all other fields vanishing . here",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are real profile functions , obeying the usual second order ordinary differential equations satisfied by the nielsen - olesen vortex , with boundary conditions @xmath93^{1/2}\\mu \\ .\\ ] ]    this string has a tension @xmath94 and carries a magnetic flux associated with the gauge field @xmath95 given by @xmath96    note that these solutions may not be the least energy solutions for the given topology .",
    "for example , the presence of bosonic condensates could change the energy per unit length .",
    "however , the existence of a condensate is a model - dependent question .",
    "this second string is not apparent in the global symmetry breaking shown in the top line of eq .",
    "( [ su5chart ] ) since @xmath97 is trivial .",
    "clearly this is because the string configuration can be deformed to the trivial configuration by using transformations belonging to the full @xmath10 .",
    "thus the second string is a semilocal string .",
    "the stability of the semilocal string depends on the relative importance of the potential energy to the gradient energy .",
    "if the scalar coupling constants are large , it is favorable to minimize the potential energy even at some cost of gradient energy .",
    "if the gauge coupling constant is large , it is most favorable to have vanishing gradient energy .",
    "the stability condition that is analogous to the electroweak condition is that @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the scalar and vector masses in the model . in terms of the coupling constants : @xmath101      we now turn briefly to another defect solution in the littlest higgs model .",
    "although the symmetry breaking scheme is somewhat complicated , as described in  ( [ su5chart ] ) , it is clear that a subset of the scheme involves @xmath102 , effected by the symmetric tensor representation @xmath103 .",
    "however , it is relatively simple to show that @xmath104 = z_2 \\ , \\ ] ] ( for example by using the exact homotopy sequence which yields @xmath105 = \\pi_1[so(5)]$ ] ) .",
    "hence , the theory contains a particularly interesting type of magnetic monopole  a @xmath0 monopole ( see for example  @xcite ) . because these monopoles correspond to a @xmath0 homotopy group , the monopole and the antimonopole are identical .",
    "if the only symmetry breaking was the global @xmath102 , then these monopoles would carry a purely global non - abelian @xmath106 charge .",
    "however , since the littlest higgs model involves gauging subgroups of the @xmath10 , the resulting monopoles will be partially gauged .",
    "consider an @xmath107 subgroup of @xmath10 that lies in the upper @xmath108 block of @xmath10 group elements .",
    "when @xmath11 gets a vev proportional to @xmath109 , the @xmath107 subgroup breaks down to @xmath110 , and this symmetry breaking too leads to @xmath0 monopoles .",
    "therefore , to construct the monopoles , we need only consider the symmetry breaking @xmath111 . now",
    "an @xmath112 subgroup of this @xmath107 is gauged .",
    "but this is the maximal non - trivial subgroup of @xmath107 .",
    "the scalar field of a @xmath0 monopole on the two sphere at infinity , is given by the action of elements of @xmath107 on some chosen vev , say proportional to @xmath109 .",
    "however , since none of the @xmath107 elements commutes with all the elements of the @xmath112 maximal subgroup , at least some of the angular gradients can be compensated by suitable gauge fields .",
    "this is what we mean by `` partial gauging '' .",
    "an explicit solution of the partially gauged @xmath111 monopole is not known but would be very interesting to work out , especially if the monopole carries some electromagnetic field distribution after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "little higgs models provide a new logical possibility for explaining the stability of the weak scale . in such models",
    "the hierarchy problem is postponed by an order of magnitude , pushing the relevant scale up to around @xmath113 tev . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the nonperturbative structure of these models , in particular their topological defect structure , as a complement to detailed studies of their low - energy phenomenology .",
    "this seems to be a natural study to perform , since little higgs models make use of new gauge and global symmetries at the tev scale , and thus inherently involve new symmetry breaking schemes that one expects to be realized during the thermal evolution of the expanding universe .    given the large number of possible ways to implement the little higgs paradigm , we have chosen to focus on one of the simplest such examples , the _",
    "littlest higgs _ model .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the existence of three distinct structures .",
    "the first is a global abelian cosmic string solution , topologically stable , arising from the breakdown of a global @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "the second is a more subtle object ; a semilocal gauge string , embedded in the larger group structure of the gauge sector of the theory .",
    "this object is not topologically stable , but may be stable dynamically , depending on the values of the coupling constants in the theory .",
    "the final object is what we describe as a partially gauged @xmath0 monopole , which is also topologically stable .",
    "we have constructed the appropriate ans \" atze for the scalar fields and the gauge fields making up these defects . in the case of the semilocal string",
    "we have also identified the gauge flux carried by the defect .",
    "what remains to be done is a careful analysis of the possible cosmological implications of our findings .",
    "clearly tev - scale strings and monopoles will have negligible gravitational effects ( for example , one does not expect them to play a role in structure formation . )",
    "however , the microphysics of such objects may be important in some circumstances .",
    "one example is their potential role in weak scale baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility arises if the strings are superconducting .",
    "as originally pointed out by witten  @xcite , it is possible for cosmic strings to carry supercurrents along them .",
    "these may be due to the presence of a scalar condensate on the string , to fermion zero modes along it , or even more exotic types of superconductivity .",
    "the evolution of a network of such superconducting cosmic strings can differ from a nonsuperconducting one .",
    "in particular , the supercurrent along loops of string builds up as the loop radiates away its energy .",
    "this can affect the endpoint of loop evolution . in some cases",
    "the supercurrent can become large enough to destabilize the loop . in others ,",
    "the current can compete with the tension of the string loop and result in stable remnants , known as _ vortons _",
    "@xcite that constrain the theory  @xcite or even may act as dark matter  @xcite . these latter suggestions depend crucially on the fermionic content of the theory , and particularly on the potential existence of fermion zero modes on the strings , leading to superconductivity .",
    "such effects require a model - specific analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper and which we therefore reserve for future work .",
    "although we have also demonstrated the existence of a partially gauged @xmath111 monopole , as we have commented , the explicit solution is not known .",
    "an interesting future direction is to explicitly construct such a solution , since it is possible that the monopole carries some electromagnetic field distribution after the electroweak symmetry breaking , perhaps resulting in cosmological consequences .",
