    "with the advent of magnetic spectrometers , it became possible to study hypernuclei through the reconstruction of missing mass .",
    "hypernuclei with one strange quark ( s=1 sector ) have long been studied using this method quite successfully .",
    "similarly to production of s=1 hypernuclei in ( @xmath12,k@xmath2 ) and ( k@xmath1,@xmath13 ) reactions , the ( k@xmath1,k@xmath2 ) reaction can be used to create s=2 hypernuclei .",
    "dover and gal found the @xmath4-nucleus potential well depth to be @xmath14  21  mev  24  mev based on their analysis of emulsion data  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 single - particle @xmath8 states are expected to be bound for the values of the potential within that range . although bound @xmath4-nucleus states would be broadened by the conversion @xmath17 , calculations have indicated that their widths could be a few mev or less  @xcite .",
    "recently reported evidence for bound @xmath4 hypernuclei produced in the ( k@xmath1,k@xmath2 ) reaction at @xmath18  = 1.6  gev / c on a scintillating - fiber target ( kek e224 )  @xcite .",
    "their missing - mass resolution was not sufficient to resolve discrete hypernuclear states but their data seemed to favor a @xmath4-nucleus potential well depth of @xmath14 16  mev .",
    "they concluded that a value of 24  mev for the potential was improbable .",
    "the 1.8 gev / c k@xmath1 beam at the ags was used to create doubly strange ( s=2 ) systems in e885 via the @xmath19 reaction at @xmath18  = 1.8  gev / c . a high k@xmath1 flux and a thick diamond target  @xcite combined to give a sensitivity to s=2 states of 1.5 counts per nb / sr as compared to 0.05 counts per nb / sr for e224  @xcite .",
    "although the experimental resolution in e885 was somewhat better than the e224 resolution ( 4.2  mev / c@xmath20 r.m.s . vs. 5.6  mev / c@xmath20 r.m.s . for hydrogen kinematics ) , it too was insufficient to resolve discrete hypernuclear states . nevertheless , an estimate of the cross section can be made ; the excitation - energy spectrum can be compared to the theoretical predictions for different potential well depths folded with our experimental resolution .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ setup ] the experimental setup for e885 is described and the event reconstruction is briefly discussed . in order to make cross section estimates and compare the data with theory , the missing - mass spectrum needs to be normalized .",

    "the k@xmath1 beam was delivered by the ags d6 beam line@xcite at a rate of @xmath21 k@xmath1/spill with a 1:1 k/@xmath22 ratio . the spill duration and",
    "repetition rate were 1.6 s and 1000 spills / hour , respectively ( 44% duty factor ) .",
    "the purity and intensity of the kaon beam provided by the ags d6 beam line greatly exceeded that available elsewhere .",
    "the beam was focused in the vertical direction by the last beam line quadrupole magnet onto a synthetic diamond target , @xmath23 with a density of @xmath24 .",
    "diamond was used as the target material in order to enhance the @xmath8 stopping rate ( a property not important for the direct production discussed in this paper ) ; the resulting compactness of the target also allowed the application of tighter geometric cuts .",
    "the momentum of the incident particle was measured using information from a scintillator hodoscope , mp , located in the beam line at the exit of the first mass slit ( not shown in fig .  [ exp ] ) and",
    "information from 3 drift chambers ( id1 - 3 ) located downstream of the last beam line magnet .",
    "the amplitude in the ic cherenkov counter , along with the measured particle momentum and the beam line time - of - flight , were used to suppress triggers from pions .",
    "additional details regarding the experimental apparatus can be found in ref .",

    "the momentum of the outgoing k@xmath2 was measured in the 1.4  t 48d48 magnetic spectrometer . the amplitude in the fc cherenkov counter , along with the measured momentum and it - bt time - of - flight ,",
    "was used to select kaons .",
    "in addition to pions , protons were another source of background in the spectrometer . to reduce the hardware trigger rate , an aerogel cherenkov counter , fc0 , was used to suppress protons ; its refraction index was selected to be sensitive to kaons but not protons from inelastic events .",
    "the measured mass spectrum for a sample of secondary particles is shown in fig .",
    "this shows that the kaons were cleanly separated from the pions and protons that passed the hardware triggers after goodness - of - fit and vertex cuts were applied .",
    "the pion peak in fig .",

    "these events were virtually eliminated by an additional software cut on fc pulse height .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the measured momenta of the incident and secondary particles allow the calculation of the missing mass .",
    "our data were normalized to the known forward - angle cross section of free @xmath8 production on hydrogen ( contained in a ch@xmath25 target ) . due to the low statistics in the bound region ,",
    "only angle - averaged differential cross sections could be obtained .",
    "these angle - averaged cross sections are denoted here as @xmath26 .",
    "we present results averaged over @xmath27 , corresponding to the full acceptance of the spectrometer , and for @xmath28 .",
    "the normalization effectively scaled the diamond target results to agree with the @xmath8 production off carbon in a ch@xmath25 target , which was , in turn , normalized to the @xmath4 production off hydrogen in the ch@xmath25 target .",
    "this procedure corrected for differences in the event reconstruction efficiency between the low - intensity ch@xmath25 running and the high intensity diamond target running .",
    "these differences were brought about , in part , by tight multiplicity cuts on detector mp .",
    "the scale for the excitation - energy spectrum was set using the equation : @xmath29 where the normalization factor is given by    @xmath30    the following definitions were used :    * @xmath31  angle - averaged double - differential cross section for hypernuclear production on carbon .",
    "* @xmath32  number of hypernuclear - production events in an excitation energy interval  @xmath33 from the diamond target .",

    "* @xmath41  number of events of free @xmath8 production on carbon in diamond target .",
    "* @xmath42  angle - averaged differential cross section of @xmath8 production on hydrogen .",
    "since the spectrometer acceptance for hypernuclear production varies very little with energy over the small region of interest about zero excitation energy , instead of the energy - dependent acceptance @xmath43 , the acceptance was calculated for a fixed excitation energy of @xmath44  mev . the angle - dependent acceptance used to determine @xmath43 was generated with a monte carlo simulation and is shown as the solid line in fig .",

    "the following values for the normalization factor @xmath47 , giving the angle - averaged differential cross section per event were obtained : @xmath48 this factor relates the counts per mev to the angle - averaged differential cross section per mev .",
    "the statistical errors given for the normalizing factor @xmath47 were due mostly to the limited amount of calibration data , namely the number of free @xmath8 production events on hydrogen and carbon in the ch@xmath25 target . the systematic uncertainty , excluding the uncertainty of the elementary cross section of @xmath8 production on hydrogen , is expected to be below the statistical error .",
    "the uncertainty of the elementary cross section for @xmath8 production on hydrogen does not affect the comparison between data and theory because the theoretical dwia calculations are normalized to the same elementary cross section .",
    "thus the data - to - theory ratio is insensitive to the assumed elementary cross - section .",
    "data sets were taken with two different ch@xmath25 targets and were used to study the missing - mass resolution .",
    "the first set used an 8  cm long target and the second set , which was acquired over a shorter time period , used a 13  cm long target . the first data set was used to study the spectrometer s intrinsic resolution and , in particular , to evaluate the tails of the resolution function .",
    "the second set was used to derive the width of the resolution function . the contribution of energy - loss effects to the resolution for the 13  cm long ch@xmath25 target",
    "is expected to be similar to the contribution from the 5  cm long diamond target .",
    "due to the two - body nature of @xmath8 production on hydrogen , the missing mass spectrum is a peak , whose width equals the experimental resolution , on top of a background from @xmath8 production on carbon .",
    "in addition to the peak width , we are also interested in the tail of the resolution .",
    "the study of the resolution tails is important ; the small hypernuclear - production signal is not well separated in missing mass from the large signal of free @xmath8 production .",
    "the background under the hydrogen peak , consisting of @xmath8 production on carbon , is subtracted using the missing - mass spectrum of the carbon target . the resulting background - subtracted spectrum is shown in fig .  [ sub ] .",
    "the width of the peak from a gaussian fit is 3.8  mev / c@xmath20 r.m.s .. it can be seen from the plot that the resolution is reasonably close to being gaussian .",
    "the missing mass resolution for the 13  cm ch@xmath25 target was measured to be 4.2  mev / c@xmath20 r.m.s . for hydrogen kinematics .",
    "the mass resolution is a function of the target mass .",
    "the resolution specific to @xmath8 production on hydrogen ( which we measure directly ) was used to infer the missing - mass resolution for carbon kinematics using simple kinematical considerations .",
    "a factor of 1.45 relates the missing - mass resolutions in carbon and hydrogen kinematics .",
    "this value results in a missing - mass resolution for carbon kinematics of 4.2  mev / c@xmath491.45 = 6.1  mev / c@xmath20 .",
    "the peak of @xmath8 production on hydrogen was also used for the energy - scale calibration .",
    "the position of the peak was adjusted to be at the @xmath8 mass value and the accuracy of the energy - scale calibration for the diamond target was estimated to be better than 0.5  mev .",
    "the theoretical ( k@xmath1,k@xmath2 ) double differential cross section for @xmath9 production , @xmath50 , was calculated , for both bound and unbound @xmath8s , in the kapur - peirls framework which was developed originally for an estimate of the @xmath51 strength function  @xcite .",

    "further details of the calculation can be found in the recent references  @xcite and @xcite in which the ( k@xmath1,k@xmath2 ) cross sections for the @xmath55c and @xmath56o targets have been estimated for @xmath57  gev / c .",
    "the calculation was performed for @xmath58 and a series of woods - saxon @xmath8 well depth parameter values : v@xmath59 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , and 20 mev . the radius and skin depth of the @xmath4 potential",
    "were fixed at @xmath60  fm and @xmath61=0.65 fm . the proton wave function in the @xmath62 target",
    "was generated using a woods - saxon potential with v@xmath63 = 50  mev , @xmath60  fm and @xmath64=0.65  fm .",
    "the elementary @xmath8 production cross section was set to 35@xmath65b / sr to be compatible with the normalization of our experimental data .",

    "figure  [ exc_spec ] shows experimental excitation energy histograms for @xmath55c(k@xmath1,)x for two different limits on the scattering angle of the outgoing , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the data clearly show an enhancement around zero excitation energy when compared to a monte carlo simulation based on quasi - free @xmath4 production which has been normalized to the total number of @xmath55c(k@xmath1,)x events ( curve qf ) .    in the same figure , the @xmath9 production theoretical curves for several @xmath4 potential well depths , folded with the 6.1  mev  r.m.s .",

    "@xmath76 is less sensitive to the model of angular dependence because the spectrometer acceptance is fairly flat over this region but drops rapidly for @xmath80 as shown in fig .",
    "[ angular ] ; we present the results for both the entire acceptance and for @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ exc_spec ] .",
    "visual inspection shows that the theoretical curve for the value of the @xmath4-nucleus potential well depth v@xmath67  =  14  mev agrees with the data reasonably well in the region of excitation energy and much better than the curve for v@xmath67  =  20  mev . if any of the observed signal results from direct two-@xmath78 production without an intermediate @xmath81 state , the discrepancy between the v@xmath67  =  20  mev results and the remaining experimental signal becomes even larger .",
    "the comparison of data to theory in the bound region can be quantified by considering the results for the angle - averaged cross section integrated over the excitation region .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the dwia calculation predicts a yield more than a factor of two larger than the measured cross section in this region when a @xmath4-nucleus potential well depth of 20  mev is used .",
    "events due to @xmath4 production off the hydrogen contained in the target and target - area scintillators produce a small peak at @xmath14 + 90 mev in excitation energy ; this peak represents only a few per cent of the total events and thus this contamination does not affect the analysis near zero excitation energy .",
    "background in the region of negative values of excitation energy can be divided into two groups :    * flat background caused by particle misidentification , severe tracking errors , etc .",
    "such background might have some structure over a wider region of missing mass , but on a small , @xmath14  100  mev scale , it should be flat .",
    "this was confirmed when observing the background in the bound region obtained by using a loose set of cuts ( hence considerable background contamination ) .",
    "* leakage from e@xmath820 due to finite missing - mass resolution .",
    "background of the first kind can be easily estimated by observing the region further below zero where leakage becomes negligible .",
    "there are 6 events in the interval of excitation energy [ -80  mev,-40  mev ] for @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ exc_spec ] ) . since the flatness of the background",
    "was confirmed by loosening the cuts , an extrapolation can be made that the number of background events of the first kind in the excitation - energy region [ -20  mev,0  mev ] is about 3 .",
    "it can be concluded then that the background of the first kind contributes only a small fraction of the total signal in the @xmath4 hypernuclear production region , and it is ignored when comparing the data to theory",
    ".    background of the second kind is taken into account when the theoretical cross section is folded with the experimental resolution . the number of events in the e@xmath830 region that leak from the e@xmath820 region depends on the shape and magnitude of the excitation - energy spectrum for e@xmath820 and on the resolution function shape .",
    "we found that the signal observed in the bound region can not be explained by leakage from the e@xmath820 region .",
    "this is already evidenced by the good agreement between the data and theory for v@xmath67  =  14  mev in the e@xmath830 region , since non - zero cross section of hypernuclear production is essential to explain the events in the bound region .",
    "we , however , made two additional checks to demonstrate it .",
    "first , a monte carlo excitation - energy spectrum , where only free @xmath8 production is simulated and no events in the e@xmath830 region are produced , was folded with the measured experimental resolution .",
    "it was found that only @xmath14 10 events are expected to have e@xmath830 for @xmath45 ( the observed number is 67 ) .",
    "second , a different resolution function was tried with very large tails added to the basic gaussian resolution function . even with those large tails , which are clearly ruled out by the resolution measurement , the signal in the bound region due to leakage was still a few times below the observed level",
    "the measurement of the missing mass in the ( k@xmath1,k@xmath2 ) reaction on carbon in e885 allowed the determination of the excitation - energy spectrum of directly produced s=2 systems .",
    "the signal in the missing - mass region below the threshold for free @xmath8 production was examined in order to extract information on the existence of @xmath4 hypernuclei and the strength of the @xmath4-nucleus potential .",
    "our analysis has shown that the events in the bound region of the missing - mass spectrum could not be explained by non - s=-2 background or effects of limited resolution , and these events are consistent with hypernuclear production .",
    "possible sources of the signal in the bound region are the production of one or two @xmath78s in the continuum or double-@xmath78 hyperfragments .",
    "the threshold for @xmath84be + @xmath78 is estimated to be at e  @xmath14  -27  mev .",
    "this channel may dominate the other two-@xmath78 channels since the two - step ( k@xmath1,@xmath22),(@xmath22,k@xmath2 ) process involves one low - momentum @xmath78 and one high - momentum @xmath78 .",
    "its cross section is expected to be several orders of magnitude larger than the production cross section for double-@xmath78 hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "no quantitative estimate of the contribution of these processes in this kinematic regime has been made and final interpretation of the excitation spectrum in terms of one - step @xmath4-hypernuclear production verses two-@xmath78 production without an intermediate @xmath4-state requires additional theoretical work .",
    "a comparison of the data and the theoretical calculations for the cross sections of @xmath4 hypernuclear production , folded with the experimental resolution , shows a reasonable agreement of the data and theory for v@xmath67  =  14  mev in the region of excitation energy -20  mev@xmath83e@xmath830  mev and a significant disagreement between the data and theory for v@xmath67  =  20  mev .",
    "these results are consistent with the conclusions of ref .  @xcite .",
    "if a significant portion of the events in this region correspond to two-@xmath78 production without an intermediate @xmath4 hypernucleus , the discrepancy between the calculation using this well depth and our results would be even larger .",
    "we conclude that the results are consistent with the theoretical predictions when a potential depth of 14  mev or less is assumed .",
    "the accuracy of dwia , which was used for the cross section calculation , was nominally assumed to be 30% in ref  @xcite .",
    "although the dwia framework has been successful in describing the production of single-@xmath78 hypernuclei using the ( @xmath12,k@xmath2 ) and ( k@xmath1,@xmath13 ) reactions , it is possible that that the dwia accuracy for the ( k@xmath1,k@xmath2 ) reaction is worse due to the higher momentum transfer",
    ". therefore a value for the @xmath4-nucleus potential well depth as high as 20  mev , though less favored , can not be completely ruled out .",
