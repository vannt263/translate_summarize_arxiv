    "the sine - gordon equation ( sge ) is a nonlinear equation which is encountered in various contexts @xcite . as an example , is can be shown that the classical string on a two - sphere is more or less equivalent to the sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "mikhailov @xcite has considered a system which can be understood as a t - dual to the classical string on a two - sphere .",
    "he has shown that there is a projection map from the phase space of this model to the phase space of the sine - gordon model .    one traditional way to obtain sge in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "is in the context of differential geometry and the theory of surfaces .",
    "the fundamental forms of a surface are not independent of each other and must satisfy the gauss - codazzi equations . it can be easily shown that the gauss - codazzi equations lead to the sine - gordon equation for a surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "the spatial shapes of the surfaces corresponding to the one and two soliton solutions have been shown in @xcite .",
    "the sge can be written in the following form , using an appropriate choice of coordinates : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant parameter . in this form",
    ", sge is a relativistic equation , which can be obtained from the following lagrangian density : @xmath2 the energy momentum tensor can be obtained from the noether s theorem @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the minkowski metric for the 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "the sge is an integrable equation .",
    "an integrable system has as many constants of motion as the number of the system s degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "since the sge have infinite degrees of freedom ( as in any other continuous medium ) , its integrability means that it has infinitely many constants of motion .",
    "integrable equations have peculiar solutions named solitons ( or kinks in the case of sge ) .",
    "solitons are localized waves which do not disperse as they move in the nonlinear medium .",
    "they also preserve their shape after the collision with other solitons or localized inhomogeneities in the medium .",
    "it is usually claimed that a soliton reobtains its initial velocity after collision with another soliton and only a phase shift results form the collision @xcite . for the system we will investigate in this paper",
    ", we will show that this claim is indeed not correct .",
    "the one soliton solution ( kink ) of ( [ sge2 ] ) is @xmath5 this solution can be obtained by different means ( e.g via backlund transformations or by direct integration and applying a lorentz boost ) .",
    "the effective width of a kink at rest is about @xmath6 .",
    "the total energy and linear momentum of a single soliton ( kink ) of the sge can be obtained from the following relations : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is related to the kink velocity via the @xmath9 , and the kink s rest energy ( mass ) is given by @xmath10 .    for one soliton solutions , it can be shown that : @xmath11 in this respect and other respects to be discussed , the kink behaves like a classical relativistic particle , although it is an extended object and has wave nature inherent in it .",
    "many applications have been found for 1 + 1 dimensional sge ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "some generalizations of this equation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we will introduce the stepwise sine - gordon equation in which the parameter @xmath1 is different for negative and positive values of the scalar field @xmath12 . by applying appropriate boundary conditions , we derive relations between the kink velocities before and after interactions .",
    "we investigate the possibility of formation of heavy soliton pairs from light ones and vise versa . in section [ sec4 ] , we briefly study the relation between the simplex structure and topological charges of different solutions . in section",
    "[ static ] , we apply boundary conditions to static , periodic and quasi - periodic solutions .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "by the stepwise sge , we mean imposing the following condition on equation ( [ sge2 ] ) : @xmath13 for each of the regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the scalar field @xmath12 satisfies ( [ sge2 ] ) with the corresponding value of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the region needing particular attention is the boundary region separating the @xmath16 and @xmath17 regions . if we have @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 ( or vice versa )",
    ", we can show that the following boundary condition holds : @xmath22 in order to arrive at this boundary condition , we can integrate the dynamical equation from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and let @xmath25 . in a similar way ,",
    "if the two regions @xmath26 and @xmath27 connect to each other at @xmath28 , we obtain the following junction condition : @xmath29 this boundary condition is obtained by integrating the dynamical equation over @xmath30 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and letting @xmath25 .",
    "these conditions provide the key relations for studying the dynamics of two soliton interactions in the stepwise sge .    like the conventional sg equation ,",
    "the stepwise sge is a relativistically covariant equation .",
    "one expects the boundary conditions mentioned above to be expressible in a manifestly covariant form .",
    "this is indeed the case . in deriving equations ( [ jun1 ] ) and ( [ jun2 ] )",
    ", we have assumed that the boundary between @xmath16 and @xmath17 regions occur at @xmath33 or @xmath28 hyper - surfaces . in the examples which will follow ,",
    "this assumption is actually fulfilled .",
    "however , in an arbitrary frame of reference , where the boundary between these two regions occurs at @xmath34 , the junction conditions should be written in the covariant form @xmath35 applied at @xmath36 ( the - and + signs correspond to either sides of the boundary ) .",
    "the free kink - anti - kink solution of the sge for @xmath37 is @xcite : @xmath38 this solution holds for @xmath21 ( with _ _",
    "i__=1 ) and @xmath19 ( with _ _",
    "if we write the suitable parameter for each interval , namely @xmath39 in the sge in each region , then by use the first boundary condition ( [ jun1 ] ) we easily obtain @xmath40 it can be shown that @xmath41 is related to the soliton s velocity far from the interaction region via @xmath42 and therefore using the relation @xmath43 , we can rewrite equation ( [ kak2 ] ) as @xmath44 this equation shows the energy conservation in annihilation of a free kink - anti - kink pair and the creation of another one with different masses .",
    "this process has been shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the kink - anti - kink solution for @xmath45 is @xmath46 from the sign of @xmath47 , we can distinguish two regions : @xmath48 where @xmath49 imposing the boundary condition ( [ jun1 ] ) we get : @xmath50 which leads to equation ( [ kak4 ] ) . from equation ( [ bkak3 ] )",
    ", we can write @xmath51 it is clear that we have no breather in the case @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case",
    ", the breather will decay to free light pairs .",
    "this case is illustrated in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "so , we distinguish two cases for @xmath54 : +    *   @xmath55 . in this case",
    "one breather turns into another breather with a different oscillation period .",
    "*   @xmath56 . in this case",
    "one breather decays into a free one with lighter rest mass .",
    "let us coin this phenomenon , which is the most important result of this work , as the soliton gun ( see fig .",
    "this phenomenon is apparently similar , to the annihilation of @xmath57 bound pair and the creation of a free @xmath58 pair .    by suitable choice of initial conditions , it is possible to create a heavy breather via light kink - anti - kink collision .",
    "this breather then decays back to the initial free pair .",
    "this is similar to the _ resonance _ phenomenon in elementary particle physics .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath37 . using the kink - kink solution @xmath59 and applying the boundary condition ( [ jun2 ] ) , after a little calculation we obtain @xmath60 or @xmath61 after the collision , the velocity of each kink will change ( see figure [ fig4 ] )",
    "this is in contradiction with the old idea that solitons will reobtain their initial velocities after collision and only a time delay results .",
    "since our system is relativistic , we can consider a reference frame observer in which one of the solitons is at rest before the collision and acquires a velocity after the collision .",
    "this is similar to the collision of a billiard ball to another ball initially at rest .",
    "simplexes are r - dimensional geometrical structures , which are shown by the symbol @xmath62 . for example",
    ", a 0-simplex @xmath63 is a point or a vertex , and a 1-simplex @xmath64 is a line or an edge .",
    "a 2-simplex @xmath65 is defined to be a triangle with its interior included and etc .",
    "the set of finite number of simplexes in @xmath66 which are properly fitted together is called simplical complex and denoted by @xmath67 . by properly , we mean that : + i ) an arbitrary face of a simplex of @xmath67 belongs to @xmath67 , that is , if @xmath68 and @xmath69 then @xmath70 .",

    "r - chain _ and is shown with @xmath79 . + a _ boundary _",
    "@xmath80 of @xmath81 is an @xmath82 -chain defined by : @xmath83 where the point @xmath84 under hat is omitted .",
    "the @xmath85 is called the _",
    "boundary operator_. the boundary of an r - chain is a set of @xmath82-chains .",
    "we can also define _ r - cycle _ , which is an r - dimensional orientated complexes which has no boundary namely if @xmath86 is a r - cycle , then @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "+ we can consider each soliton of the stepwise sine - gordon equation as a 1-chain in @xmath12 space .",
    "the classical vacuum of the potential of the system is @xmath88 , which are discrete points .",
    "the kink solution is an oriented simplex or chain,@xmath89 and the anti - kink can be shown as a chain in the form @xmath90 .",
    "if we act the boundary operator on the one soliton solution ( kink ) , we obtain @xmath91 @xmath92 is the topological current which is identically conserved ( @xmath93 ) . the topological charge in the sine - gordon system can be written as : @xmath94 = ~\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\partial_{1}~\\left(\\varphi(+\\infty),\\varphi(-\\infty)\\right).\\ ] ] it is clear that topological charge can be obtained directly by applying the boundary operator on the soliton - chain .",
    "the topological charge for the different solutions discussed in pervious sections are as follows . for kink @xmath95 , anti - kink @xmath96 , kink - kink @xmath97 , breather and free kink - anti - kink @xmath98 .",
    "the topological charge is quantized and is independent of the @xmath99 parameters in the stepwise sge . + in a similar way",
    ", we can consider multi - soliton solutions as complexes in the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "if we define the sine - gordon equation on @xmath100 instead of @xmath101 , the single valuedness condition of @xmath12 implies that there could be no single soliton solutions , and the multi soliton solutions are as _ _",
    "it is natural that the total charge of the multi soliton solutions on a compact manifold is zero @xmath102 . in other words ,",
    "the total topological charge of the sine - gordon equation ( ordinary or stepwise ) , on the compact space @xmath100 is always zero .",
    "it is well - known that the sg system has also static , periodic and quasi - periodic solutions which can be interpreted as a chain of kinks and anti - kinks or a chain of kinks ( anti - kinks ) .",
    "these are given by jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "consider the first integral of the static sg equation : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is an integration constant .",
    "for single soliton solutions , it is easily seen that @xmath105 due to boundary conditions at @xmath106 . for @xmath107 ,",
    "the static solutions can be expressed in terms of the jacobi sn functions @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are integration constants , and @xmath111 is an integer .",
    "this solution oscillates around @xmath112 , which corresponds to a lattice of alternating kinks and anti - kinks . as @xmath113 , the distance between neighboring kinks and anti - kinks increases , and in the limit @xmath114",
    ", we will have an isolated kink ( or anti - kink ) solution .    for @xmath115",
    ", we will have the following static solution : @xmath116 this solution corresponds to a lattice of kinks , with the distance between the kinks increasing as @xmath113 .",
    "based on the fore - mentioned solutions , we now turn to the stepwise sg equation with @xmath117 and @xmath118    we must now apply the boundary conditions at @xmath119 , where @xmath119 s are the solutions of @xmath120 .",
    "we can distinguish several categories of static solutions for the stepwise sg equation . among different possibilities ,",
    "let us introduce the following four cases :    * kink lattice , attached to a single kink .",
    "the boundary condition leads to : @xmath121 + a sample solution is shown in figure [ chainkink ] . *",
    "kink , smoothly attached to a part of the kink - antikink chain and then to an anti - kink ( figure [ kinkperant ] ) .",
    "the boundary condition leads to @xmath122 this is an interesting solution , since it is a non - topological , static soliton with zero topological charge .",
    "it is well - known that the conventional sg system does not have a static , zero charge ( non - topological ) solution .",
    "* kink chain , smoothly attached to a part of the kink - antikink chain and then to an anti - kink chain ( figure [ chainperchain ] ) .",
    "the boundary condition leads to @xmath123 * kink chain attached smoothly to another kink chain ( see figure [ chainchain ] ) : @xmath124",
    "in this paper , we studied the stepwise sine - gordon system in which the mass parameter @xmath1 is different for positive and negative values of the scalar field . by applying appropriate boundary conditions at the boundary between the two regions , which are derived from the field equation , we extracted the relation between the soliton velocities before and after the collision .",
    "similar to the boundary conditions in electrodynamics or in the schrdinger equation , the boundary conditions of the stepwise sge are obtained by integrating the field equation across the boundary between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 regions .",
    "these relations are consistent with energy and momentum conservation relations for the system under consideration .",
    "we considered different cases and showed that in such a system , it is possible to transform a heavy pair of solitons to a light pair and vise versa .",
    "the concept of soliton gun was introduced for the first time . in this process , a heavy bound pair annihilates into a free low mass pair , moving at high velocities .",
    "since the kinks belonging to different ( @xmath16 and @xmath20 ) sectors have different rest energies ( masses ) , they can not retrieve their initial velocities after the collisions .",
    "the stepwise sge is therefore an interesting system for studying the collisions between solitons of different rest energies .",
    "the similarity of the kinks and classical particles is further demonstrated in the framework of the stepwise sge .",
    "we emphasize that in this system , the initial soliton velocities are not necessarily retrieved after the collisions .",
    "the application of boundary conditions to static , periodic and quasi - periodic solutions was also worked out , leading to new results , not present in the conventional sg system .",
