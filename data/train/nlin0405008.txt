    "chaos that arises naturally in hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space is a source of unstable behaviors when resonances overlap . achieving the control of these systems by reducing or even suppressing",
    "chaos is a long standing and crucial problem in many branches of physics . among the various methods which have been designed to control hamiltonian chaos , two different frameworks must be distinguished  : hamiltonian flows ( continuous time )  @xcite , and symplectic maps ( discrete time )  @xcite .    a method for controlling hamiltonian flows has been proposed in refs .",
    "its aim was to find a small control term @xmath0 for the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is integrable , in order to have a more regular dynamics for the controlled hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "an explicit algorithm to construct a control term of order @xmath4 making the controlled hamiltonian integrable was devised .",
    "the main advantage of this approach to control is the robustness of the control term @xmath0 , which means that one can tailor another control term @xmath5 which is close to @xmath0 such that @xmath6 the controlled hamiltonian @xmath7 is still more regular than @xmath8 and @xmath9 this control terms satisfies some specific requirements of the experiment like a partial knowledge of the potential @xmath10  @xcite or the localization of the control in a phase space region  @xcite .",
    "let us stress that this method differs from other methods by the fact that the controlled dynamics is hamiltonian  : this makes it relevant to the control of inherently hamiltonian systems  @xcite such as beams of charged test particles in electrostatic waves  @xcite , two - dimensional euler flows  @xcite or the geometry of magnetic field lines  @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "the problem we address is to set up a control theory in a similar way for symplectic maps .",
    "we consider two - dimensional symplectic maps @xmath11 on the cylinder @xmath12 which are @xmath13-close to integrability .",
    "our aim is to find a small control term @xmath0 such that the controlled symplectic map @xmath14 is more regular ( closer to integrability ) than @xmath15 . in what follows ,",
    "we develop algorithms for finding control terms of order @xmath4 .",
    "we describe two approaches to the control of symplectic maps  : one approach ( in section  [ sec2 ] ) is designed for maps which are generated by lie transforms .",
    "we show that it is possible to obtain an explicit expression for a formal control term which makes the controlled map integrable .",
    "this approach extends in an obvious way to @xmath16-dimensional symplectic maps .",
    "however , since this approach is difficult to handle in practice , we develop a second one ( in section  [ sec3 ] ) for maps which are written in mixed coordinates ( i.e.  half implicitly , half explicitly ) .",
    "this second method is used for practical purposes since numerous area - preserving maps are written in such form .    in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we apply our control method to two examples  : the standard map to benchmark our method , and the tokamap , which imposes an additional restriction on the type of control .",
    "we compute analytically the control term and show numerically the phase portrait of these maps and the associated controlled maps .",
    "as the formal expansion may generate undesirable side - effects in phase space , we also discuss suitable modifications of the control terms .",
