    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most powerful explosions in the universe and are observationally characterized with intense short flashes primarily in a high - energy band ( so - called `` prompt emission '' ) and long - lived afterglows observed from x - ray to radio wavelength . the grb afterglow is believed to involve a relativistically expanding fireball ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interstellar matter ( ism ) influences the fireball shell after it has been collected and considerable energy is transferred from the shell to the ism .",
    "the energy transfer is caused by two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "it is also believed that the forward shock produces long - lived afterglows and the reverse shock generates short - lived bright optical flashes(e.g .",
    "* ) and/or intense radio afterglows(e.g .",
    "a number of afterglows have been monitored densely in x - ray and optical bands since launch of the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , and significant number of afterglows showed the different temporal evolutions in x - ray and optical bands .",
    "these results indicated that the simple forward shock model can not explain their behavior altogether , and additional processes are required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . inverse - compton scattering and/or reverse shocks may play the important role to solve the problem .",
    "@xcite suggested the local inverse - compton scattering to describe the x - ray faster decay comparing with that of optical .",
    "@xcite introduced a synchrotron self - inverse compton radiation from a reverse shock to explain x - ray flare and its early afterglows .",
    "thus , confirming the existence of reverse shocks at particularly longer wavelengths and ascertaining their typical occurrence conditions is critical .",
    "because the expected lifetime of reverse shock at longer wavelengths is substantially longer than those at optical wavelengths , decoding radiations into forward and reverse shock components is possible .",
    "in addition , numerous rapid optical follow - ups are missing the reverse shock components ; although , several successful detections at optical wavelengths have been made .",
    "the possible reason of the missing reverse shock component would be that typical reverse shock synchrotron frequency is much below the optical band .",
    "submillimeter ( submm ) observations are the key element to catch reverse shock and to understand emission mechanism of grb afterglows . searching for reverse shock emission in the submm wavelength would test this possibility .",
    "these submm observations also provide clean measurements of source intensity , unaffected by scintillation and extinction .",
    "however , no systematic submm observational studies in the early afterglow phase exist .",
    "this has remained so in reverse shock studies for some time .",
    "one of the main reasons the absence of dedicated submm telescopes and strategic follow - ups with rapid response that involve employing open - use telescopes for this challenging observations .",
    "in addition , it is nearly impossible to have rapid ( several hrs after the burst ) follow - ups with current open - use telescopes that require manual preparation of the observational scripts .",
    "in addition to this technical problem , sensitivities of current submm telescopes except alma are not good enough to detect number of afterglows in the submm band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , rapid careful target selections are required to conduct effective submm follow - up observations using open - use resources .",

    "the submm afterglow exhibited a flat evolution with slight brightening between the first and second periods .",

    "swift_/bat data @xcite , we confirm that grb120326a with @xmath82 fluence ratio in the 25 - 50 kev and 50 - 100 kev bands falls into the x - ray rich grb family .    the abundance of the multi - color optical light curves for estimating the jet break time suggests that grb120326a is a favorable target for evaluating @xmath83@xcite and @xmath84@xcite relations",
    "here , @xmath84 is the correlation between the intrinsic spectrum peak energy @xmath85 and the jet collimation - corrected energy in the prompt phase , @xmath86 .",
    "the closure relation of the observed optical temporal decay and the spectral indices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that , of all the @xmath87 options , the optical results are consistent with both the fast and the slow cooling and both the wind and the ism medium , as long as @xmath88 and @xmath89 lie below the optical band . here ,",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 are the characteristic synchrotron frequency and the cooling frequency based on the standard forward shock synchrotron model .",
    "thus , the jet opening angle and the jet corrected energy are estimated using @xmath90 as @xmath4 and @xmath91 erg by assuming the circumburst density @xmath921.0 @xmath93 and the energy conversion efficiency @xmath94 , to covert the measured jet break time @xmath90 to the jet opening angle , we used the formulation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ relation ] , grb120326a obeys the @xmath83 and @xmath84 relations within @xmath95 confidence level .",
    "therefore , grb120326a belongs to the typical long duration grb family , even with a low @xmath81 .",
    "based on the closure relations , the observed temporal evolution and spectral features of the optical afterglow are well consistent with those of the forward shock synchrotron model . the fact that @xmath88 and @xmath89 both lie below the optical band , implies that within the standard synchrotron model , x - ray afterglow therefore lie in the same spectral regime as the optical emission , and that the standard model therefore predicts the same temporal and spectral shape for x - rays as for the optical .",
    "however , the observed x - ray light curve shows a significant deviation from the predicted behavior of the standard model and appears to require an additional component . using the testing method of the forward shock model using the decay index ( @xmath96 ) relation between the optical and x - ray@xcite",
    ", we find that grb120326a is a clear outlier ( @xmath97 ) and the origin of the x - ray afterglow could differ from that of the optical . for conducting a more rigorous analysis , we selected the normal optical decay phase as from @xmath98 s to @xmath99 s. the optical light curve in this phase is well fitted with a simple power law function with an index of @xmath100 .",
    "for the time range , we forced to fit the x - ray light curve with the simple power law function and obtained the decay index of @xmath101 .",
    "hence , this event remained outlier ( @xmath102 ) and the x - ray emission could have a extra component such as x - ray flare on the forward shock synchrotron emission .    to check the excess in the x - ray light curve , we shifted optical light curve to the x - ray band with the factor @xmath103 by assuming the x - ray and optical lie on the same segment of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "we used @xmath104 with @xmath105 error of 0.15 estimated from the optical observations and the closure relation .",
    "as shown in figure [ lc ] , the shifted light curve shows a significant gap with that of observed x - ray and the gap is rather smaller after @xmath106 s. one of the main reasons of the gap is no consideration of the intrinsic extinction for the optical component at the burst site due to lack of spectral coverage in the optical observations .",
    "if the main x - ray component after @xmath107 is originated from the same segment of forward shock synchrotron radiation with optical ( as sharing the similr decay index with those of optical ) , @xmath108 mag with the smc extinction curve is required to fill up the smaller gap after the @xmath107 s. the extinction value of @xmath108 mag is rather larger comparing with other majority of optically bright events ( @xmath109 mag ) @xcite .",
    "we also added the shifted optical light curve with @xmath110 that provides the upper limit of the forward shock synchrotron radiation under the @xmath87 condition ( figure [ lc ] .",
    "although these imply that adjustment of @xmath111 and introducing extinction may be the solution to explain the gap after @xmath107 , there remains a significant x - ray excess between @xmath112 and @xmath107 s.    the forward shock synchrotorn model based on the optical afterglow is also impossible to explain the submm emission .",
    "based on the closure relation , the slow decay observed in the submm light curve requirs @xmath113 ( _ i.e_. fast cooling condition for both ism and wind types ) .",
    "hence , @xmath114 is required to satisfy the closure relation for the submm and optical afterglows all together .",
    "in addition to the closure relation , the observed flux densities ( both in the submm and optical bands ) at @xmath115 s and the temporal decay index in the optical bands tightly constrain the range of characterized frequencies as @xmath116 hz and @xmath117 hz to make the fast cooling condition . with these conditions , we find that even a drastic case ( e.g. @xmath118 and @xmath119 with very high density of @xmath120 several @xmath121 @xmath122 ) can not meet the condition and that the origin of submm component also could differ from that of the optical .",
    "thus , additional radiation is required to explain x - ray and submm emissions all together .      to describe the entire spectral energy distribution",
    ", we performed modeling for the optical light curves and spectra by using the boxfit code @xcite that involved two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical jet simulations to determine the burst explosion and the synchrotron radiation parameters with a homogeneous circumburst medium .",
    "hence , hereafter , we only consider the ism condition and do not verify whether ism or wind condition is favorable .",
    "this code also performs data fitting with the downhill simplex method combined with simulated annealing .",
    "based on the observational results , we fixed as @xmath123 and a power - law electron spectrum of slope @xmath124 .",
    "the observing angle was also fixed as @xmath125 . by using only the optical data with the code , we determined the optimal modeling parameters to describe the optical light curves as @xmath126 erg , @xmath127 @xmath122 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 . to adjust the model function , we also set the jet opening angle as a free parameter and then @xmath130 provided favorable agreement ( @xmath131 for @xmath132 ) with observing the light curve .",
    "the solid line in figure [ lc ] indicates the best model function for the @xmath48 band light curve , which also well agreed with the analytical model function .",
    "this opening angle adjustment is reasonable because @xmath123 was estimated by considering the conical jet .",
    "additional note is that the post jet - break closure relation is no longer valid under the consideration of detailed spreading of the jet @xcite .",
    "however , we are not concerned about this , since we were able to achieve the good fit with the simulation - based fit models . with the adjusted jet opening angle ,",
    "grb120326a still obeyed the @xmath84 relation .",
    "we also attempted to determine the optimal solution by using optical and submm data with the code .",
    "however , no sufficient solution describe the temporal evolution of submm and optical afterglow all together was determined by the @xmath133 evaluation with @xmath134 iterations .",
    "all of trials provided reduced @xmath133 greater than 13 .",
    "this is consistent with the forward shock testings described above .",
    "we generated the forward shock synchrotron model spectrum by using the box fit with the best modeling parameters for the light curve .",
    "figure [ lcsed ] shows the sed at @xmath115 s after the burst .",
    "the spectrum in the x - ray and submm exhibited substantial excesses from the best model function and indicated that the afterglow spectrum required additional radiation components .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the result of the @xmath135 relation and the shifted optical light curve to the x - ray band with factor @xmath103 .      a solution that explains the x - ray excess and the different origin of the submm emission is to introduce synchrotron self - inverse compton radiation from reverse shock .",
    "this is one of the most feasible method to deal two notable observed properties all together . assuming the deceleration time is near the x - ray light curve peak at @xmath136 s , the initial lorentz factor @xmath137 is estimated as @xmath138 , which is consistent with the thin - shell case ( @xmath139 )",
    "here , @xmath140 is the critical lorentz factor that distinguishes thin shell models where the reverse shock remains newtonian , from thick shell models @xcite .",
    "this lower @xmath137 might be associated with the low @xmath141 property .",
    "it might also originate from the cocoon fireball as part of two - component jet in the collapsar framework ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this case , thermal radiation is expected to arise in the optical light curves @xcite .",
    "however , the observed optical light curves show no excess in the late phase .    using the estimated parameters described in above , we calculated the model function for synchrotron self - inverse compton radiation from reverse shock under the thin - shell condition described in @xcite . for this calculation",
    ", we assumed @xmath142 , and peak flux densities of reverse and forward shocks as @xmath143 mjy and @xmath144 mjy , respectively .",
    "figure [ lcsed ] shows the calculated spectrum for the reverse shock and inverse compton components at @xmath115 s with the obtained key parameters of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "although the observed x - ray flux was slightly brighter than calculated self - inverse compton component , the total spectrum including forward shock was sufficiently described the overall properties of the afterglow . because @xmath149 , the expected decay index of the reverse shock component in the observed submm band was @xmath150 , which was consistent with the slow temporal evolution of the submm afterglow ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the relatively shallower evolution than that of expected also implies the smooth transition of @xmath152 in the observing band , unlike the sharp break in figure [ lc ] .",
    "this could be same with other spectrum break such as non - existence of sharp cooling break in afterglow spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed x - ray decay ( @xmath153 ) and spectrum ( @xmath154 ) indices were also basically consistent with the expected values ( @xmath1552.8 and @xmath156 ) for @xmath157 .",
    "we conducted multi - wavelength observations of a typical long duration grb 120326a , including rapid observations using sma .",
    "our sma observation successfully made the fastest afterglow detection among seven submm afterglows at 230 ghz , and monitored from @xmath76 to @xmath77 s. the submm afterglow showed considerably slower temporal evolution ( @xmath158 ) which is unlikely to be explained by the forward shock synchrotron model .",
    "based on our dense optical observations , we presented the optical afterglows were well fitted by the broken power - law model and the forward shock synchrotron model is feasible to explain the properties . with the boxfit code",
    ", we also found the reasonable model function within the forward shock synchrotron model under the assumption of ism circumburst medium . using the simple testing method of the forward shock model with temporal decay indices of optical and x - ray afterglows",
    ", we found the origin of the x - ray afterglow could differ from that of optical .",
    "our joint spectrum fitting for prompt emission using _ swift_/bat and _ suzaku_/wam also characterized the event and find that current event obey the @xmath83 and @xmath84 relations with in @xmath95 confidence level .    based on the detection and the slow decay of the afterglow in submm , we introduced the synchrotron self - inverse compton radiation from reverse shock and find that this is a plausible idea to explain the diversity .",
    "this successful modeling could benefit other grbs .",
    "similar to grb120326a , numerous events exhibited no apparent jet breaks in x - ray band and different temporal evolutions between the x - ray and optical .",
    "these observational properties imply that additional component such as reverse shock and its synchrotron self - inverse compton radiation make the different temporal evolution and hide obvious jet break in x - ray . because of a lack of submm observations for these samples , interpretation from the same picture for these events was difficult .",
    "thus , further rapid follow - ups and continuous monitoring with submm instruments such as sma and atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) will enable systematic testing of the reverse shock and self - inverse compton radiation .",
