    "the function of a protein often requires dynamic changes between different three - dimensional conformations .",

    "more recently , tsai _ et al . _ @xcite suggested an alternative mechanism in which the ligand selects and stabilizes a complementary protein conformation from an equilibrium of low - energy and higher - energy conformations .",

    "these experiments provide evidence for a pre - existing equilibrium of conformations that is shifted by the binding or unbinding of a ligand , as suggested in the selected - fit mechanism of protein binding @xcite . for the binding of myosin to actin ,",
