    "in order to prevent rapid proton decay a new quantum number called r - parity is conserved in susy models , with two clear consequences for susy searches with atlas .",
    "the first one is the lightest supersymmetric particle is absolutely stable , giving a signature of missing energy in the detector .",
    "secondly we expect susy events to exhibit relatively large multiplicity of high @xmath0 jets , as susy particles with strong interaction couplings have highest production rates at the lhc and these will go through long decay chains .",
    "furthermore it was decided to study susy with different search strategies based on exclusive requirement of zero , one or more leptons .",
    "+ the aim of the described studies was to develop data driven techniques to estimate the major standard model ( sm ) backgrounds such as w / z bosons with associated jets , top quark pair production and jet production from qcd processes .",
    "susy should show up as an excess over the predicted sm events in the so - called `` signal '' region , where new physics may be present .",
    "the prediction is done by extrapolating from a `` control '' region , which should be as close as possible to the signal region , give an unbiased estimate , have sufficient statistics and small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the first requirement has the effect of contaminating the control region with susy events , which results in overestimating the sm background in the signal region , but this contamination can be taken into account .",
    "+ we assumed the lhc running with @xmath1 and a collected integrated luminosity of @xmath2 . due to space limitations the methods described in this note are a subset of all the methods developed and the reader is referred to @xcite for a complete description .",
    "the one - lepton search mode requires an isolated lepton .",
    "this will strongly suppress the qcd background that dominates over other processes by orders of magnitude and has high theoretical and instrumental uncertainties .",
    "a lepton in our studies is either an electron or a muon with @xmath0 of at least @xmath3 . to avoid overlap with the di - lepton mode",
    ", we veto events with a second identified lepton with a @xmath0 of more than @xmath4 . assuming r - parity conservation we demand at least four jets with @xmath5 and @xmath6 out of which one jet must have @xmath7 .",
    "the missing transverse energy @xmath8 should be larger than @xmath9 and above @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the effective mass .",
    "our last selection criterium is that transverse sphericity @xmath12 is larger than @xmath13 .",
    "all definitions of variables can be found in @xcite .",
    "after the selection the only non - negligible backgrounds left are w bosons with associated jets ( w+jets ) and top quark pairs .",
    "the latter we divide into two categories : semileptonic ( @xmath14 ) and dileptonic ( @xmath15 ) top quark pairs , as these have different shapes and yields .",

    "+ taking physics features into account we construct probability density functions ( p.d.f.s ) that model each of the three main backgrounds in the three observables .",
    "for example the semileptonic @xmath20 shows a clear peak in @xmath17 if we find the correct three quarks from top quark decay .",
    "+ for a broad range of susy parameters it was observed that the shapes of low @xmath8 and low @xmath21 distributions have little dependence with the chosen model point .",
    "thus we can construct a model - independent ansatz shape to describe the susy contamination at low energy .",
    "+ the combined model used in the fit is the addition of p.d.f.s of each background sample and the susy ansatz shape with a yield parameter for each separate component .",
    "the first step in the procedure is to fit the @xmath8 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 distributions with shapes obtained from monte carlo simulation . to make it more data - driven is to release in the fit as many of the shape parameters as possible .",
    "figure [ fig : combfit - fitfixedshape ] shows the result of the fit with floating yields and floating shape parameters to @xmath22 of data .",

    "@xmath8 will then point to or away from this poorly reconstructed jet . to reject these qcd events the value of the difference in azimuthal angle between the @xmath8 vector and each of the three highest-@xmath0 jets",

    "the @xmath32 with associated jets process is one of the main backgrounds in the no - lepton search . to estimate its shapes and",

    "+ four corrections must be applied to get a correct estimate , as summarized by this formula :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the corrected number of events per bin of @xmath8 , @xmath38 is the raw number of control sample events as a function of @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the kinematic correction due to extra selection criteria , @xmath41 is the fiducial correction since we can not detect leptons beyond @xmath5 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are corrections for lepton reconstruction efficiency as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath0 and finally we correct for the difference in branching ratios of the z boson . +",
