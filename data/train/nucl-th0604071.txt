    "it is expected that above a critical temperature , @xmath2 mev , qcd undergoes a chiral phase transition where the relevant degrees of freedom change from mesons and baryons to a phase of strongly coupled quarks and gluons , the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "this new phase of matter is being searched for in a number of ultra - relativistic heavy ion facilities .",
    "there are a number of current observations in favor of the sqgp , ranging from hydrodynamical flow ( soft probes ) to jet quenching ( hard probes ) .",
    "however , most of these observations are blurred by the fact that the space - time evolution of the sqgp is short and its conversion to hadronic matter is involved .",
    "since the latter dominates the final stage of the evolution , it is producing competing signals that interfere with those from the sqgp . in this respect ,",
    "dilepton and photon emissions are interesting probes of the collision region as neither interact strongly with the medium produced in these collisions , thus they probe the _ early _ stages of the collision .",
    "this is in contrast to hadronic observables which thermalize along with the collision region thus providing information only on the late ( or freeze - out ) stage of the collision .",
    "making quantitative predictions of the production rates of dileptons and photons is difficult for a number or reasons .",
    "since the temperature produced in typical heavy - ion collisions is in the range of 200 - 300 mev which is about the qcd scale factor , @xmath3 , the differential cross sections can not be computed in a weak - coupling expansion .",
    "another uncertainty is detailed knowledge of the evolution of both hadronic matter and quark gluon phase produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in addition there is also a background of dileptons from other processes not occurring in the quark - gluon plasma such as hadronic decays .    in the past",
    "there have been a number of experiments probing photons and dileptons created in hadronic collisions .",
    "one of the most recent experiments was the ceres ( na45 ) taking place as the cern sps collider which looked for dielectrons .",
    "it was found that the dielectron production exceeded the theoretical expectations for _ conventional _ processes in both hadronic and qgp matter  @xcite , especially in the mass region @xmath4",
    "a number of theoretical analyses were put forward to explain this excess based on effective lagrangians with medium modification  @xcite and dropping vector meson masses  @xcite .",
    "model independent emission rates constrained by the strictures of broken chiral symmetry and data were unable to account for the excess rate reported by na45 @xcite .",
    "however , the large statistical and systematic errors reported by na45 in exactly the excess region , did not allow for a definitive conclusion as to the theoretical nature of the emissivities .",
    "in this letter we revisit these issues in light of the recently reported dimuon data from the na60 collaboration using in - in collisions at 158 gev / nuc  @xcite .",
    "these data have far better statistics , which gives much better constraints on any medium modification to the vector mesons @xcite .",
    "we use the model independent analysis in  @xcite to analyze these data , whereby the emissivities are constrained by broken chiral symmetry in a dilute hadronic medium , and by non - perturbative qcd in the sqgp .",
    "the collision expansion and composition are extracted from an underlying hydrodynamical evolution set to reproduce the cern sps conditions .",
    "the rate of dilepton emission per unit four volume for particles in thermal equilibrium at a temperature t is related to the thermal expectation value of the electromagnetic current - current correlation function  @xcite . for massless leptons with momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",

    "[ eq : rate ] is multiplied by    @xmath15    to compare the theoretical dilepton production rates with those observed in heavy ion collisions , the rates must be integrated over the space - time history of the collision region and then finally integrated over the dilepton pair s transverse momentum and rapidity in order to compare with the yields measured by the na60 collaboration .",
    "the final expression for the rates is given as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the dilepton invariant mass , y is the dilepton pair rapidity , @xmath18 is the spatial rapidity , @xmath19 is the dilepton pair transverse momentum ( with @xmath20 defined as the angle between @xmath19 and the fluid element s velocity ) , x is the hadron fraction , r is radial coordinate ( with @xmath21 set by the freeze - out temperature ) , and @xmath22 is the experimental acceptance taking into account that the ceres detector covers a limited rapidity in the interval @xmath23 in the lab frame .",
    "the integration over @xmath24 and @xmath1 was done over the full hydrodynamic simulation of the fireball as described below .",
    "@xmath25 can be found by considering the two invariants @xmath26 and @xmath27 constructed from the dilepton momentum and fluid 4-velocity which can be expressed as :    @xmath28    giving    @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the transverse fluid velocity which is taken from the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the acceptance function has a complicated dependence on @xmath32 and y , but since our rates are y - independent we have used an acceptance with @xmath33 and @xmath19 dependence built to specifications provided by the na60 collaboration @xcite . without detailed hadronic data available ( such as transverse mass spectra and hbt analysis ) a careful consideration of hadronic input , such as freeze - out temperature , can not be made . therefore there is a large uncertainty in the overall normalization of the yields , which depends strongly on @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the assumption of boost invariance can also affect the normalization as the acceptance probes very specific rapidities .",
    "the approach taken here is to normalize our results to the excess data in the peripheral centrality windows which fixes the normalization in the central bins .",
    "at temperatures t@xmath36t@xmath35 lattice calculations have predicted that the relevant degrees of freedom consists of ( strongly ) interacting quarks and gluons . in order to compute the dilepton production rates as one would expect from a conventional phase of quark - gluon plasma we use the born qq annihilation term @xcite which for massless quarks is    @xmath37\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the number of colors , @xmath39 the charge of the quarks , and @xmath40 .",
    "it should be mentioned that  [ eq : bornqqbar ] reduces to the well - known vacuum result @xmath41 at t=0 and that the finite temperature rate is always smaller then the t=0 rate due to pauli blocking .",
    "it has also been seen in lattice simulations that near the critical temperature @xmath42 there are still substantial chromoelectric and chromomagnetic condensates present leading to additional non - perturbative effects .",

    "even though there are various approaches to calculating production rates , they differ in the way in which the current - current correlation function in eq .  [ eq : rate ] is approximated and evaluated .",

    "one of the main results , following from the assumption of a central - plateau structure in the rapidity distribution is that of boost invariance , stating that the initial conditions and thus the subsequent evolution of the system are invariant with respect to a lorentz boost .",

    "as given by the vanishing of the divergence of the energy - momentum stress tensor one must have an equation of state ( eos ) relating the local values of the pressure , energy density , and baryon density ( @xmath93 ) .",
