    "in this section , we consider minimal theoretical schemes which can lead to `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillations and study their consequences .",
    "we will consider the minimally replicated standard model gauge group i.e. @xmath23\\times [ su(3)'_c\\times su(2)'_l\\times u(1)'_y]$ ] where the unprimed group operates in the visible sector and the primed group operates in the mirror sector .",
    "the two sectors communicate only via gravity as well as via very weakly interacting particles .",
    "if the only communications between the two sectors were via gravity , the effective @xmath3 operator @xmath24 would have a strength of @xmath25 and would lead to oscillation times which are minuscule and of no consequence .",
    "we therefore need other interactions between the two sectors in a way that respects gauge invariance and renormalizability in order to get sizable @xmath26 .",
    "we outline two such models below .",
    "both the models will build on the basic particle content of the mirror model given below ( for the nonsupersymmetric case ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly in the above table , the fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 are singlets under both the gauge groups and mirror partners of each other .",
    "if they are electroweak singlets , they could couple to particles in either sector@xcite .",
    "a simpler version of the theory where the sectors communicate only via the term mixing the @xmath27 with @xmath28 can be obtained if there is an extra @xmath29 in both sectors , such that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are nonsinglets under this and there is a connector field @xmath30 with quantum numbers such that we have the coupling @xmath31 allowed .",
    "the vev of the @xmath30 field would then connect the two sectors .",
    "in any case we will assume that the interaction lagrangian for the model to consist of two terms : @xmath32 where @xmath33 in each sector will have the standard form with usual yukawa couplings as follows : @xmath34 the gauge couplings and the above yukawa couplings do not lead to @xmath3 oscillation and we need to add an effective dimension 6 operator in each sector plus a connecting term : @xmath35 given these interactions , having sizable @xmath3 transition and also nonvanishing neutrino masses puts constraints on the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the model . in the case at hand",
    "we have @xmath38 conserved .    in this model ,",
    "the neutrino is a dirac fermion due to @xmath39 conservation , with a mass in the range of 0.1 ev connecting the @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is given by the usual seesaw diagram except that instead of a majorana mass for the right handed neutrino , we have the @xmath37 interaction .",
    "this gives @xmath42 this implies that @xmath43 gev@xmath16 .",
    "the six quark operator leading to @xmath3 oscillation has the strength : @xmath44 @xmath45 is related to the @xmath3 transition operator roughly by the formula @xmath46@xcite ( all in gev units ) .",
    "putting all this together and requiring that @xmath47 sec .",
    "implies that @xmath48 gev .",
    "for @xmath49 , we must have @xmath50 gev .    to see the meaning of this scale m",
    ", we can imagine a higher scale theory , where there is a particle connecting the two quarks and the @xmath51 whose exchange would lead to the interaction @xmath52 .",
    "this particle would be a color triplet and must have mass @xmath53 gev in order to have required `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation .",
    "it must couple only to the @xmath54 and @xmath55 and not to any other fermion of the standard model to be consistent .",
    "for example if it coupled to @xmath56 it would lead to extremely fast proton decay and will therefore be ruled out .",
    "the existence of such a low mass particle could be searched for in colliders and thereby provide a test of the possibility of `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation .",
    "this particle will decay to two jets and will imitate the squark in an r - parity violating supersymmetric theory .",
    "present experiments would eliminate any such particle below a 100 gev .",
    "but in such a case , one will have to add extra symmetries to explain why they do not couple to each other . ]",
    "since the neutrino is a dirac fermion , observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will rule out this model .",
    "it will not lead to any oscillation between active and sterile neutrinos and as such can not accommodate the lsnd results .",
    "therefore if miniboone confirms the lsnd results , this model will be ruled out . furthermore , there is no neutron - anti - neutron oscillation in this case .",
    "the model above can be modified to incorporate a majorana neutrino as well as the lsnd results as follows .",
    "if the @xmath38 symmetry responsible for neutrino being a dirac fermion can be broken by adding a mass term @xmath57 , this model leads to majorana neutrinos in each sector . furthermore ,",
    "if we assume that mass parameters @xmath58 are different from those in the mirror sector , one could make the mirror neutrino masses to be larger ( say @xmath59 ev ) thereby making it possible to accommodate the lsnd results in the usual manner@xcite .",
    "in such a version , the high scale sector is mirror asymmetric which would go more naturally with asymmetric inflation whereas the tev scale low energy sector is fully mirror symmetric , so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the same mass .",
    "let us discuss what constraints are imposed on this model by a `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation .",
    "a new feature of this model compared to the previous model is that it will lead to oscillations between @xmath8 and @xmath60 with a strength @xmath61 which gives @xmath62 to be consistent with the present lower limit on @xmath63 sec.@xcite with @xmath64 sec .",
    ", we must have @xmath65 making the @xmath27 and @xmath27 a pseudo - dirac pair .",
    "this is a very high degree of fine tuning of parameters .",
    "one could interpret this as follows : ( a ) if the @xmath3 oscillation time scale is as fast as second and ( b ) if the mirror neutrinos are responsible for explaining the lsnd results and/or the neutrinos are established to be majorana fermions , then @xmath66 oscillation time should not be very much higher than its present lower limit of @xmath67 seconds without making the level of fine tuning much worse . a search for @xmath66 would then provide a test of this model .",
    "the constraint of a low mass color triplet scalar particle can be avoided if we consider the following supersymmetric model . another way to look at",
    "it is to ask if the low mass scalar triplet of the previous sections could be a superpartner .",
    "this assumption has other constraints that we discuss below .",
    "this model is based on the same particle content as in table i except for the fact that each field in the table is to be understood as a superfield that contains a fermion as well as a boson in it and there will be two higgs fields @xmath68 as required in mssm . the neutrino masses in this model could arise from the existence of the @xmath27 field as in the nonsupersymmetric case and become a dirac fermion or they could alternatively arise from the r - parity violating terms in each sector .",
    "the @xmath3 oscillation in this case arises from the presence of bino - mirror - bino mixing ( bino being the superpartner of the @xmath69 gauge field of the standard model ) so that the neutrino mass and the @xmath3 oscillation are decoupled from each other leading to very different character for this model .",
    "the superpotential of this model is given by @xmath70 the communication between the visible and the mirror sector is done via the bino mixing term @xmath71 as already mentioned .",
    "this term is gauge invariant but breaks supersymmetry softly and is allowed .",
    "a typical feynman diagram giving rise to @xmath3 oscillation is shown in fig . 1 and has the strength @xmath72 for @xmath73 gev , and @xmath74 tev",
    ", we get the constraint @xmath75 gev .    in this case",
    "there is another constraint coming from the fact that a gluino mediated graph can lead to @xmath76 oscillation and present bounds on this process imply that @xmath77 this implies that for @xmath78 sec .",
    ", the gluino has to be superheavy ( @xmath79 gev for @xmath80 gev . )",
    "this represents a severe degree of fine tuning and is ceratinly different from the conventional supersymmetry scenarios .",
    "-@xmath81 mixing . ]",
    "-@xmath81 mixing . ]",
    "if we accepted this scenario , there are cosmological implications which put further constraints .",
    "this has to do with a class of new effects in the model that lead to mixing between normal and mirror higgs fields via radiatively induced interactions of type @xmath82 .",
    "they arise at the one loop level via diagrams of type in fig.2 .",
    "this effect can be estimated to be @xmath83 in the simplest assumption of @xmath84 tev .",
    "note that this estimate is independent of the gluino mass .",
    "the value of @xmath85 will have implications for cosmology and maintaining the temperature asymmetry between the two sector@xcite that we discuss below .",
    "we saw from the above discussion that a transition time @xmath86 sec .",
    "corresponds to a strength of the six quark operator of order of @xmath87 gev@xmath88 .",
    "this has to be consistent with another requirement of the mirror models that the asymmetry in the temperatures must be maintained down to the bbn epoch . to ensure this",
    ", we must have the process @xmath89 induced by the @xmath3 operator must be out of equilibrium all the way down to the same epoch . to see what constraint it imposes on the model , we note that the out of equilibrium condition is given by : @xmath90 this implies that above a temperature of @xmath91 gev , the @xmath3 interaction will bring the visible and the mirror sectors into equilibrium , which is undesirable from the point of view of bbn .",
    "this means that the reheat temperature of the universe after inflation must be less than 300 gev .",
    "this of course puts other constraints on the model e.g. how to generate baryon asymmetry etc .",
    "in the particular case of the supersymmetric model , the induced @xmath92 can also lead to transitions between the visible and the mirror sector .",
    "the strength of this transition is @xmath93 . comparing this with the hubble expansion rate , the out of equilibrium condition gives that for the first case @xmath94 gev , the two sectors are in equilibrium .",
    "clearly this is in contradiction with the same constraint from @xmath3 transition .",
    "this would imply that the supersymmetric model for fast @xmath3 transition given above is incompatible with cosmology unless further fine tuning of parameters is imposed ( such as vanishing @xmath95 terms for instance ) .",
    "we now turn to discuss some phenomenological implications of having a `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation .",
    "first we consider the propagation of reactor neutrons .",
    "clearly the deficiency here is the `` short length '' over which the grenoble neutrons propagate which for these hypothermal neutrons amounts to a @xmath96 time interval .",
    "this is so since one needs to strongly shield the earths magnetic field so as not to quench to much even slow oscillations like the above @xmath97 oscillations with oscillation time of @xmath98 .",
    "however much faster ( say @xmath99 ) @xmath100 oscillation rates of the type considered here could survive much larger -say @xmath101 gauss fields .",
    "far longer propagation of order the neutron @xmath102 minutes lifetime are experienced by neutrons detected during solar flare . travelling with mildly relativistic speeds",
    "the @xmath103 million km distance from sun spots to earth they could readily oscillate into @xmath9s in the intervening space which have @xmath104 gauss .",
    "this yields a factor two reduction in the neutron flux which however can not be ascertained unless we have an accurate knowledge of the neutron flux at the source .",
    "note however that a satellite located at a few earth radii distance would detect some flux of up going neutrons even when the solar flare occurs at the opposite hemisphere and is completely eclipsed by the earth .",
    "the point is that all the n s making up @xmath105 of the initial flux penetrate through the earth and then -just like in @xcite super - gkz scenario some fraction therefore will oscillate back into neutrons . clearly to optimize the @xmath106 oscillations the satellite",
    "should be located as far as possible , increasing travel time and minimizing the b fields .",
    "unfortunately for distances @xmath107 the solid angle and the frequency and duration of the eclipsed solar flares will be minimal .",
    "consider however a generic satellite which is just   one earth radius where the magnetic field ( falling like @xmath108 ) is @xmath109 gauss . along the way to it @xmath110 of the @xmath9s",
    "will have reconverted back into ordinary neutrons- and during total eclipse even such a weak signal delayed by just @xmath111 sec may be detectable . in this short note",
    "we have not attempted to see if there are indeed enough relevant data of this type , or in connection with reactor , pulsed intense neutron beams which could potentially impact on the @xcite suggestion . and",
    "@xmath112 are the propagating states does not ( like in the @xmath113 system ) prolong the life time of the antisymmetric combination .",
    "the reason being that the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 -unlike the kaon and anti - kaon- decay into different final states @xmath114 and the decay amplitudes can not ( negatively ) interfere . ]",
    "in this brief note we have explored to what extent neutron - mirror neutron oscillation , a phenomenon which is in principle possible in the mirror models , can be realized in the context of realistic models .",
    "we find that while a `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation can be realized in a nonsupersymmetric model , it imposes a nontrivial constraint on the model of having a 10 - 1000 gev color triplet scalar boson in the visible sector which could be detected at the lhc .",
    "we also note that if @xmath3 oscillation time is as fast as one second and lsnd result is explained by mirror neutrinos , then @xmath66 oscillation should be observable unless the parameters of the model are severely fine tuned .",
    "we also show that cosmology of these models require that the reheat temperature after inflation in these models must be less than 300 gev .",

    "<S> we comment on a recently discussed possibility of oscillations between neutrons and degenerate mirror neutrons in the context of mirror models for particles and forces . </S>",

    "<S> we also find that the reheat temperature after inflation in generic models that give fast @xmath3 oscillation be less than about 300 gev in order to maintain the required relative coolness of the mirror sector .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.0 in    oscillations of electrically neutral particles such as the @xmath4 ( to @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ( to @xmath7 ) mesons and the neutrinos have provided us with a wealth of information about the nature of fundamental interactions . </S>",
    "<S> if baryon number is not a good symmetry of nature ( as is implied by grand unified theories ) , other oscillation phenomena can take place among electrically neutral systems e.g. neutron - anti - neutron oscillation@xcite and hydrogen - anti - hydrogen oscillation@xcite . in the context of mirror universe models@xcite where there is an identical copy of both the forces and matter of the standard model present side by side with the known forces and matter , </S>",
    "<S> a new possibility arises whereby a neutron ( @xmath8 ) can oscillate into its mirror partner @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> since the mirror particles are supposed to have only gravitational or similarly suppressed interactions , the mirror neutron will not be detected by our measuring devices and the process @xmath3 will cause the disappearance of the neutron </S>",
    "<S> . clearly , such an @xmath3 oscillation will have phenomenological and astrophysical implications .    </S>",
    "<S> recently berezhiani and bento @xcite have pointed out that all observations are consistent with the possibility that neutrons can oscillate to mirror neutrons on a very short time scale of about one second and that @xmath3 oscillations with this rate can allow some super gzk@xcite ultra high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays to reach us providing that the cosmic microwave background temperature in the mirror sector is significantly lower , by say @xmath10 than in our visible sector . </S>",
    "<S> the paper@xcite correctly pointed out that :    \\i ) the strict bounds@xcite on @xmath11 utilizing the resultant nuclear excitation and gamma emission do not apply here as @xmath12 oscillations inside nuclei is forbidden by energy conservation ;    \\ii ) the grenoble bounds @xcite on the neutron -anti - neutron oscillation rate @xmath13 coming from the absence of dramatic anti - neutron annihilation events also does not apply to @xmath12 oscillation .    </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath3 oscillation rate as large as @xmath14 would of course imply a reduction of the reactor neutron flux by as much as 1% . </S>",
    "<S> in view of other neutron loss mechanisms at this level which can amount to as much as 5% or more , @xmath15 sec@xmath16 . can be used as a crude upper bound on the rate and is presumably not inconsistent with observations .    </S>",
    "<S> coming to galactic propagation of neutrons , first point to note is that since the lorentz enhancement of the magnetic field compensates for time dilation , in order to have unquenched @xmath12 oscillations that would allow super gkz cosmic rays ( cr ) @xcite on earth , requires that along most of the @xmath17 mega parsec distance travelled by the neutron , the b field must be smaller than @xmath18 gauss . </S>",
    "<S> while this seems like a severe demand , the authors of @xcite argue that it is conceivably achieved in large extragalactic patches .    </S>",
    "<S> our purpose in this brief note is to discuss some theoretical implications of having a relatively `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation in the context of simple mirror models . </S>",
    "<S> we also note some new phenomenological and cosmological consequences of this possibility .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider two consider two classes of mirror models : one without supersymmetry and the other with supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that in the context of non - supersymmetric models , simplest realizations of `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillations together with a nonvanishing neutrino mass would require the existence of light ( @xmath19 gev ) color triplet boson . </S>",
    "<S> this could provide an interesting test of the model . in the presence of supersymmetry </S>",
    "<S> , a new class of models can be constructed where the ordinary and mirror bino s @xmath20 and @xmath21 mix to give @xmath3 transition . </S>",
    "<S> these models lead to new phenomena such as @xmath22 as well as higgs - mirror - higgs mixing with interesting implications . in this case , there exist severe constraints on the supersymmetry breaking parameters of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that such `` fast '' @xmath3 oscillation times would require that the reheat temperature after inflation has to be lower than about 100 gev in order to maintain the required relative `` coolness '' of the mirror sector in such models . </S>",
    "<S> such low reheat temperatures would necessitate the existence of new mechanisms for the origin of matter .    </S>",
    "<S> we also make a phenomenological remark that fast @xmath3 transitions lead to the interesting possibility of having neutrons effectively `` tunnel '' through large amount of material . </S>",
    "<S> this for instance could lead to an upward flux of neutrons from the earth during solar flares . </S>"
