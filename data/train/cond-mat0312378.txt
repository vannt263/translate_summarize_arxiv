    "recently , the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity has been observed in a number of materials , including , uge@xmath0,@xcite urhge,@xcite and zrzn@xmath0.@xcite the experiments so far have ascertained the presence of bulk superconductivity , and various thermodynamic and transport properties have been measured , but little is known yet about the detailed nature of the superconducting state .",
    "an obvious possibility is spin - triplet pairing induced by ferromagnetic fluctuations , but other mechanisms have also been proposed.@xcite one interesting aspects of the experiments , which may provide a clue about the origin and the nature of the pairing , is that the superconductivity is observed only on the ferromagnetic side of the magnetic phase boundary .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to early theories of superconductivity induced by ferromagnetic fluctuations , which predicted that this type of superconductivity would be equally strong on the paramagnetic side of the magnetic phase boundary.@xcite however , in a recent paper,@xcite to be referred to as i , it has been shown that the presence of magnons in the ferromagnetic phase can lead to a drastic enhancement of the superconducting @xmath1 compared to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "clearly , more properties of the superconducting state must be studied in order to differentiate between different possible pairing mechanisms . in this context",
    ", an interesting result is the recent measurement of the specific heat in urhge.@xcite taken at face value , this experiment shows a single transition into a superconducting state , and a low temperature specific heat that is linear in the temperature , which suggests that a fraction of the electrons remain in a fermi - liquid state at low temperatures .",
    "similar behavior has been observed in uge@xmath0.@xcite    to date all of the theoretical work has assumed only the simplest type of superconducting order for a given pairing mechanism , with the main goal being to determine the phase boundary for superconductivity .",
    "for example , in i the present authors assumed an ordering of spin - triplet cooper pairs with spins oriented in the direction of the magnetization .",
    "let us denote the gap function for this ordering by @xmath2 .",
    "previous work on helium-3 in a magnetic field@xcite suggests that at some point , the cooper pairs with spins oriented opposite to the magnetization , characterized by a gap function @xmath3 , will form as well .",
    "more generally , the complete phase diagram for these systems will likely be complicated and involve ferromagnetism coexisting with several types of superconducting order.@xcite    our goal in this paper is three - fold .",
    "first , we develop a formal theory that enables us to consistently describe ferromagnetism coexisting with two types of superconducting order .",
    "the superconductivity in our theory is caused by ferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "our goal is to derive an equation of state , analogous to the strong - coupling or eliashberg equations of conventional superconductivity , that describes both up - spin and down - spin superconducting order , as well as a consistent magnetic equation of state in the presence of superconductivity .",
    "a major complication is that , because the superconductivity is itself caused by a fluctuation effect , a simple mean - field theory is not sufficient , and fluctuations need to be taken into account .",
    "the fluctuations that cause superconductivity within our theory are described by the spin susceptibility tensor .",
    "our second goal is therefore to develop a theory for the spin susceptibility , both in a pure ferromagnetic phase , and in coexisting ferromagnetic and superconducting phases .",
    "the pairing potential for superconductivity involving only @xmath2 and @xmath3 is given by the longitudinal susceptibility , @xmath4 .",
    "however , the transverse susceptibilities , @xmath5 , are also needed because they enter the normal self energies , and because they couple to @xmath4 via mode - mode - coupling effects .",
    "in fact , as shown in i , within the framework of our theory it is this mode - mode - coupling mechanism , which exists only in a magnetically ordered state , that causes the superconductivity to be observable only in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we will see that the magnons , which are described by @xmath5 , have an interesting dispersion relation in the superconducting state and , under certain conditions , can become effectively massive .",
    "a striking feature of the mass is that it is proportional to the inverse square of the magnetization , and thus singular for small magnetization .",
    "we give estimates showing that this result should be observable with neutron scattering .",
    "our third goal is to discuss the phase diagram for superconductivity and magnetism , based on the above results . in a theory that allows for pairing of both up - spin and down - spin electrons ,",
    "one expects a phase diagram that is qualitatively shown in fig .",

    "the two superconducting phases have been drawn to end in the same point for simplicity , but this will not necessarily be the case.,width=226 ]    oberves a transition from a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase to a normal conducting ferromagnetic ( ncfm ) one .",
    "with decreasing temperature , the system enters a ferromagnetic superconducting state where only up - spin electrons are paired ( scfm i ) .",
    "finally , with further decreasing temperature , down - spin electrons are paired as well ( scfm ii ) . in general the coupled magnetic and superconducting equations of state",
    "are very complicated to solve . for the points we want to make ,",
    "however , a complete solution is not needed .",
    "our aim here is to compute , for our proposed pairing mechanism , the relative magnitudes of the transition temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the phase boundaries between the ncfm phase and the scfm i phase , and between the scfm i phase and the scfm ii phase , respectively .",
    "generically we find that these transition temperatures are close to one another .",
    "experimentally this suggests that , for example , any specific heat measurement should find two closely spaced transition signatures .",
    "this result is in conflict with the naive interpretation of the specific heat measurement in urhge noted above .",
    "a possible alternative interpretation of the data consistent with our theory will be discussed below .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ii ]",

    "( [ eqs:3.5 ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the gaussian approximation effectively treats the superconducting gap as a fixed external field .",

    "the magnitude of this effect will depend on the detailed parameters of the material in question , but it clearly can be substantial : assuming a value of @xmath2 on the order of the superconducting @xmath1 , or @xmath134 , a value of @xmath115 on the order of 10 times the magnetic @xmath1,@xcite or @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , we find that the prefactor in the dispersion relation is enhance by a factor of 100 over its value in the normal conducting phase .    for larger wave numbers , @xmath137 , we have _ ( k ) .",

    "the gaussian theory approximates this behavior by a true gap , ignoring the asymptotic regime . in the limit @xmath99 the asymptotic regime shrinks to zero , and the gaussian theory becomes qualitatively correct .",

    "the wave number region where one expects this shoulder is given by g_^-2 < k^2 < g(_/)^2_m^-2 .",

    "second , we add some comments about our prediction of two superconducting transitions that are separated only by a small temperature interval . within our model , we have found this prediction to be very robust , especially given that all of our approximations have a tendency to overestimate the suppression of @xmath7 compared to @xmath6 .",
    "even an ( artificial ) increase of the gap in the transverse susceptibility by a factor of 10 does not make a visible change in fig .",

    "it is interesting to note that such a split transition , with two closely spaced discontinuities in the specific heat , has been observed in upt@xmath144,@xcite but only after a long period of gradually increasing sample quality .",

    ", one also has to keep in mind that the ground state will not be homogeneous , due to the formation of a spontaneous vortex state.@xcite normal electrons in the vortex cores are a possible source of a residual specific heat coefficient .",
    "this effect has been neglected in the current theory and will be pursued in a future publication .",

    "the singularity is therefore a result of a coupling between the particle - hole excitations and the magnetic and superconducting goldstone modes .",
    "it is very similar in nature to , e.g. , the anomalous magnetization dependence of the magnon stiffness in a normal conducting ferromagnetic phase that was discussed in ref ..    in conclusion , we summarize our results .",
    "we have presented a consistent and self - contained theory for the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in itinerant electron systems .",
    "we have presented a field - theoretic formulation of this problem that allows for the determination of both the magnetic and the superconducting equation of state in a systematic loop expansion .",
    "this method , which utilizes ma s procedure for generating equations of state , remedies some shortcomings of the earlier theory presented in i , which relied on a minimization of the free energy .",
    "the self - contained character of the theory is achieved by means of explicit expressions for the magnetic susceptibility , which is needed as input for the generalized eliashberg equations .",
    "these expressions have been evaluated in ferromagnetic phases , both normal conducting and superconducting ones .",
    "this is a generalization of the theory for the magnetic susceptibility that was developed in i , and it explicitly takes into account the feedback effects that are characteristic for any purely electronic mechanism for superconductivity .",
    "we have explicitly evaluated this theory to one - loop order , and for a model that allows for two components of the superconducting order parameter , one each for cooper pairs consisting of up - spin electrons and down - spin electrons , respectively .",
    "the limitations of this one - loop approximation , which neglects superconducting fluctuations and uses a zero - loop expression for the magnetic susceptibility , have been discussed by means of a phenomenological lgw theory that complements our microscopic theory . we have found that , for generic parameter values , the two superconducting transitions that describe the pairing of up - spin and down - spin electrons , respectively , occur close to one another , with transition temperatures that typically differ by only on the order of 10% .",
    "this suggests that , if the superconductivity observed in urhge is indeed of a spin - triplet p - wave type mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations , then the broad feature observed in the specific heat near the temperature of the resistive transition@xcite should contain two transitions that are close together . if samples of improved quality should show only one sharp discontinuity in the specific heat , then this would be a strong argument against the type of pairing we have assumed in this paper .",
    "a caveat is provided by our assumption of parabolic bands , however , as discussed above .",
    "the presence of spin - triplet superconductivity has further been shown to drastically change the structure of the dispersion relation of the ferromagnetic magnons . in materials with a small exchange splitting this effect is observable with neutron scattering , and can also be used as a probe for the nature of the superconductivity .",
