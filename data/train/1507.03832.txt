    "for the high controllability and purity of quantum gas , it has been the popular platform to investigate novel quantum phenomena since it was realized in experiment .",
    "the cold atoms can be frozen to the zero point oscillation in transverse with highly anisotropic magnetic trap or two dimensional optical lattices @xcite , and thus the cold atoms become a one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum gas of strong correlation in longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "the interactions between atoms will be the effective 1d contact interaction depending on the @xmath0-wave scattering length and its strength can be tuned from the weakly interacting regime to the strongly interacting regime with feshbach resonance technique and confinement induced resonance . in this way the bose gas of strong repulsive interaction , tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas @xcite , can be realized , and offer researchers an opportunity to investigate the quantum many body physics of previously so - called toy model .",
    "besides the realization of arrays of 1d gases , jacqmin etc.s experiment realized a single 1d bose gas close to the strongly interacting regime and the atom number fluctuation measurements can be performed in small slices of gases @xcite .",
    "this allow us to study the properties of 1d bose gas related with temperature and the interplay effect between interaction and temperature .",
    "theoretically the unconfined 1d bose gas of contact interaction corresponds to the lieb - liniger model and can be exactly solved with bethe - ansatz method in the whole interacting regime at zero temperature and at finite temperature @xcite . combining the exact solution of integral model with local density approximation we can study the 1d quantum gas confined in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the exact wave function of strongly interacting tg gas in a harmonic trap can be obtained with bose - fermi mapping method @xcite .",
    "so far most previous research focus on the ground state properties of 1d bose gas .",
    "its properties at finite temperature were not the focus of research although the temperature effect is important .",
    "the investigation of ground state properties show that as the atomic interaction becomes strong the ground state density profiles of bose gas evolve from the bose properties to the  fermionized \" characters same as the polarized free fermi gas @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the equilibrium state of 1d bose gas is coherent quasicondensate in weakly interaction regime , and the gas reaches fermonized tg regime in strongly interacting regime .",
    "although the tg gas show the same density profiles as free fermi gas , the density matrix and the momentum distribution exhibit the typical bosonic properties @xcite .",
    "based on two - body correlation the interacting 1d bose gas can be classified as various physical regimes with the change of temperature and interaction @xcite , and the interplay between interaction and temperature is an important topic . at low temperature",
    "the 1d bose gas might be in the strongly interacting tg regime , a coherent regime or a fully decoherent quantum regime .",
    "although the finite - temperature effect can not be discounted , the theoretical determination of correlations , energy , and momentum scales at finite temperature has only been partially investigated @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will investigate the tg gas trapped in a harmonic trap at finite - temperature . with thermal bose - fermi mapping method the pair distribution function , the reduced one - body density matrix ( robdm ) , the occupation of natural orbitals , and momentum distributions are evaluated for different temperature . as a comparison",
    "the corresponding result of polarized free fermi gas are also exhibited .",

    "the quantum gas becomes an effective one - dimensional many body quantum system .",

    "the investigation of robdm shows that at low temperature there exist odlro in tg gas similar to the properties of zero temperature case , while the odlro vanish at high temperature .",
