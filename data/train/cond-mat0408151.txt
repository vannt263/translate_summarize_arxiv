    "recently , there has been considerable interest in the field of spintronic applications .",
    "they range from various approaches in logic and memory elements to quantum computation.@xcite many spintronic device concepts rely on the so - called das - datta spin transistor , @xcite where the transfer of spins between the spin - polarized source and drain contacts is controlled by the gate bias through the perpendicular ( i.e. , confining ) electric field in the quantum well ( qw ) channel .",
    "experimentally , the efforts have concentrated mainly on @xmath0-type iii - v devices ; in particular , those with ingaas qws .",
    "the reasons for this preference are ( 1 ) easy control of electron spin states in this material@xcite and ( 2 ) availability of iii - v diluted magnetic semiconductors.@xcite much less attention has been paid to the hole - based spintronic applications , whose rationale actually originates from the considerations related to the bulk semiconductors .",
    "indeed , in bulk cubic semiconductors the top of the valence band at the brillouin zone center is four - fold degenerate ( including spin ) , and hybridization of the hole states for finite wavevectors depends on the direction of the wavevector . as a result , hole scattering is supplemented by simultaneous change of spin , and the so - called elliott - yafet mechanism of spin relaxation is very effective.@xcite in fact , the hole spin relaxation rate is close to the momentum relaxation rate ; i.e. , nonquilibrium spin relaxes too fast to allow control in any realistic device .",
    "this picture is not exactly correct in the case of two - dimensional ( 2d ) holes confined in a qw , where the degeneracy at the zone center is partially lifted due to quantization .",
    "moreover , the hole spectrum in an asymmetric qw is completely nondegenerate for nonzero wavevectors , qualitatively resembling that of electrons .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for 2d holes in gaas qws were analyzed , for example , in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , we address the problem of the hole spectrum and spin relaxation in strained sige qws .",
    "previously , spin splitting in such qws was estimated based on the observation of the circular photogalvanic effect@xcite and transport measurements.@xcite in ref .",
    ", possible sources of spin splitting proportional to the in - plane hole wavevector were examined briefly . here , we present quantitative calculations of spin splitting based on the luttinger hamiltonian approach .",
    "we take into account the biaxial strain inherent in the sige heterostructures which gives rise to stronger splitting of the hole subbands .",
    "we consider both the cases of tensile and compressive strain resulting in the light - hole ( lh)-like and heavy - hole ( hh)-like ground state , respectively .",
    "based on the results for spin splitting , we analyze the spin - relaxation process for 2d holes . for asymmetric qws",
    ", it is found that the dyakonov - perel mechanism is more important than the elliott - yafet mechanism . according to our calculations ,",
    "the hole spin mean - free path in a strained si qw can be as large as a micron at room temperature .",
    "this estimate suggests the feasibility of p - type spintronic applications based on si , particularly in view of recent advances in group - iv magnetic semiconductors.@xcite",
    "first , we need clarify what we mean by the term `` spin '' . due to the degeneracy at the zone center , the spin - orbit interaction leads to strong hybridization of the hole states and the total angular momentum must be considered .",
    "if some asymmetry is introduced such as the confinement in a qw , the degeneracy between the lh and hh states is lifted at least partly .",
    "when the resulting doublet is well separated energetically from the other states , it can be treated by using a spin hamiltonian with the effective spin @xmath1 .",
    "so , in speaking of spin states , we mean the states of this quasi - degenerate doublet .",
    "let us describe the model used in our calculations .",
    "we consider the case of a qw grown along the @xmath2 $ ] direction that is subject to biaxial strain .",
    "we start from the following @xmath3 effective - mass hamiltonian : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the luttinger hamiltonian with @xmath6 corresponding to the part with @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the contribution due to the biaxial strain , @xmath9 is the confining potential which forms the qw , and @xmath10 is the @xmath3 unity matrix . the explicit expression for @xmath11 is not provided since it is readily available in the literature ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "note , however , that in the following the top of the hh band is used as the reference energy . as in @xmath12 theory , @xmath13 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "following the conventional notation,@xcite we choose the _ zeroth - order _ ( i.e. , unperturbed ) wavefunctions as @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where the plane - wave factors @xmath17 $ ] are omitted for simplicity . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , the first subscript of @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) denotes the doubly degenerate states for @xmath7 , @xmath0 is the subband number , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 represents the lh , hh , or spin - split ( ss ) states , respectively .",
    "in fact , if the strain is strong enough such that the corresponding strain energy @xmath24 is comparable to the spin - orbital gap @xmath25 in the bulk material , the so - called lh and ss states are hybridized even for @xmath7 .",
    "hereafter , we term the states `` lh '' and `` ss '' which take the genuinely light and spin - split nature in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "this hybridization is evident from the eigenvalue equations for the lh and ss envelope functions @xmath27",
    ": @xmath28 @xmath29 here @xmath30 stands for @xmath21 or @xmath23 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are parameters of the hole spectrum,@xcite @xmath33 is the free electron mass , @xmath34 is the @xmath35 unitary matrix , and the deformation energy mentioned previously is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the deformation potential constant and @xmath38 is the strain tensor .",
    "the envelope functions for hh states @xmath39 are determined by the conventional schrdinger equation with an effective mass @xmath40 .",
    "in general , further steps require numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) to obtain the spectrum and envelope functions of lh and ss states .",
    "considerable simplification is possible , however , if the quantization energy is much less than @xmath24 or @xmath25 , which is often the case for strained sige qws . under this approach ,",
    "it is adequate to use an `` effective mass '' approximation for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , which treats the nondiagonal part of @xmath41 containing the @xmath42-derivatives as a perturbation .",
    "subsequently , we obtain @xmath43 here the spectrum @xmath44 and the envelope functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 are determined by the conventional schrdinger equation with the effective masses @xmath47\\right)^{-1 } , \\\\",

    "the effective hamiltonian for the quasi - degenerate ground subband can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 are pauli matrices .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath59 is proportional to the product @xmath69 for the terms proportional to @xmath60 and to the product @xmath70 for those proportional to @xmath61 , where @xmath27 and @xmath71 are the envelope functions obtained as a solution of schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath9 and appropriate effective masses . for a symmetric @xmath9 , the products of this kind are zero and the spin splitting vanishes in accordance with the general symmetry requirements .    based on these results for hole spectrum , we can calculate the related spin relaxation rate .",
    "basically , two mechanisms of relaxation must be addressed .",
    "the first is the dyakonov - perel mechanism.@xcite it is related to spin precession with a frequency @xmath72 , which changes randomly due to rapid electron transitions in the momentum space . for this mechanism ,",
    "the spin relaxation times for the @xmath30 , @xmath73 , and @xmath42 spin components obey the following relation @xmath74 . for non - degenerate carriers",
    ", it is given as @xmath75 in this equation , @xmath76 is the boltzmann distribution function and @xmath77 is an average characteristic time of electron scattering;@xcite in the following , we will assume it to be equal to the electron momentum relaxation time .",
    "another dominant source of spin relaxation is the elliott - yafet mechanism .",
    "it is caused by hybridization of the hole states at the finite wavevectors . using the results for hole wavefunctions , an order - of - magnitude estimate in a strongly asymmetric qw",
    "is obtained for the ratio of elliott - yafet relaxation time @xmath78 to @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the characteristic energy of hole confinement , typically of the order of few tens of mev .",
    "the expression suggests that the dyakonov - perel mechanism provides the major contribution to spin relaxation in the case of well - defined quantized energy levels .",
    "of course , this is not true for weakly asymmetric qws , where the dyakonov - perel mechanism can become less important .",
    "as a specific example , we consider sige inversion layers .",
    "the first case corresponds to a thin ge layer grown on sige , and the second a si layer on sige ; an insulator is placed on top in each case .",
    "such structures have been studied extensively due to their perspective applications in p - type enhanced - mobility metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors.@xcite hole confinement in these devices is achieved by a strong perpendicular electric field and the insulator as schematically illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the barrier at the left - hand side is assumed to be infinitely high .",
    "the deformation energy in this case is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the elastic constants of the qw material ( i.e. , si or ge ) , @xmath37 is the deformation potential constant , and @xmath85 is the relative mismatch in the lattice parameters . for the case of a relaxed sige buffer ,",
    "the ground state in the si qw is lh - like with @xmath86 , while the ge qw with @xmath87 has a hh - like ground state .",
    "note that the band discontinuity at the si / sige or ge / sige interface is not a well - defined quantity since not only the band gap but also the spin - orbit energy @xmath25 are different across the interface . in our calculations , we assume that the confining electric field is strong enough to shift the holes away from the interface .    in figs .  3 and 4",
    ", we show the obtained spin splitting and spin relaxation rate @xmath88 as a function of the confining electric field at @xmath89 k. figure  3 presents the case of a si / si@xmath90ge@xmath91 structure , while fig .",
    "4 is for ge / si@xmath91ge@xmath90 .",
    "the momentum relaxation time @xmath77 of @xmath92 s is used , which corresponds roughly to the reported values of hole mobility.@xcite the material parameters are taken from ref .  .",
    "the spin splitting is calculated for the absolute value of the wavevector corresponding to the in - plane kinetic energy of @xmath93 along the @xmath94 $ ] ( dotted line ) or @xmath95 $ ] ( dashed line ) direction , respectively . for the case of a si qw , the main contribution to @xmath96 at room temperature is due to the terms proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "this is because the @xmath60-linear term is proportional to @xmath32 , which is small in the case of si . on the other hand ,",
    "the main contribution to @xmath96 in the ge qw is from the hh@xmath97lh coupling since the spin - orbital gap @xmath25 in ge is large .",
    "note that the mixing between valence and conduction band states can noticably influence spin splitting in the latter case ( i.e. , the ge qw).@xcite for a si qw , this is less likely to be important since the direct band gap is 3.5  ev , much larger than that for ge ( 0.9  ev).@xcite    as can be seen for the figures , the valence band of a ge qw is characterized by spin splitting comparable to that for electrons in iii - v qws .",
    "simultaneously , the hole spin relaxation time is quite short . in contrast , spin splitting and the relaxation rate for holes in a strained si qw are much smaller .",
    "the reason for this is a weak spin - orbit interaction in si , which is characteristic for light elements . in particular , the @xmath61 contribution to @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath25 , which is as little as 44  mev for si .",
    "hence , it can be suggested that by applying a moderate longitudinal electric field , hole spin in a strained si qw can be transferred over a distance of a micron or so without the loss of coherence . on the other hand ,",
    "spin relaxation can be tuned effectively by modulating the confining electric field .",
    "it is important to note once more that in unstrained structures , say conventional @xmath98-type si / sio@xmath99 inversion channels , spin relaxation is expected to be much faster due to relatively small subband separation and , as a result , strong hybridization of the hole states at finite wavevectors .",
    "we predict that spin splitting of 2d holes and the related spin relaxation time in strained sige qws can be effectively controlled by the structure composition and the degree of qw asymmetry . for field - effect transistor - like",
    "structures,@xcite spin splitting depends strongly on the value of the perpendicular electric field .",
    "in particular , the hole spin relaxation time in a strained si qw channel can be in the hundred picosecond range at room temperature , making it suitable for spintronic applications .",
