    "the electromagnetic properties of classical vacuum ( i.e. , empty space ) are characterized by its permittivity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , _ anti  vacuum _ has permittivity @xmath2 and permeability @xmath3 l02a . the perfect lens , as conceptualized by pendry pendry01 , consists of a slab of anti  vacuum sandwiched by two slabs of vacuum .",
    "while this perfect lens is an idealization which can never be fully realized in practice l02b , the concept of the perfect lens has spawned much theoretical and experimental work within the past few years on negative refraction and metamaterials .",
    "indeed , interest in this area continues to escalate , with negatively refracting metamaterials having now entered the visible frequency regime dolling . aside from metamaterials ,",
    "negative refraction occurs in biological scenarios tavenga , and there is the possibility of negative refraction arising in special ml04 and general lms05 relativistic scenarios .",
    "a fundamental characteristic of vacuum is that its constitutive parameters are invariant under a lorentz transformation .",
    "a straightforward derivation reveals that the constitutive parameters of anti  vacuum are also invariant under a lorentz transformation .",
    "therefore , the vacuum / anti  vacuum / vacuum perfect lens is lorentz covariant .",
    "a canonical formulation for the perfect lens has also been developed , wherein the two constituent materials are linear , homogeneous , orthorhombic materials l02b , ls03 . in this letter",
    ", we address the question : is this canonical perfect lens invariant under a lorentz transformation ?",
    "the canonical perfect lens comprises a slab of material labeled @xmath4 , sandwiched between two slabs of a material labeled @xmath5 , as schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "with respect to an inertial frame of reference @xmath6 , material @xmath5 occupies the regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while material @xmath4 occupies the region @xmath9 .",
    "both materials move with a common and uniform velocity @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum ; thus , the direction of relative motion is parallel to the interfaces between material @xmath5 and material @xmath4 .",
    "the materials @xmath5 and @xmath4 are linear and homogeneous . with respect to an inertial reference frame @xmath13 that also moves at velocity @xmath14 relative to @xmath6 , their frequency ",

    ", we see that the phasors at @xmath32 and @xmath33 are related as @xmath34 as described elsewhere l02b , ls03 , the solution of the problem of the canonical perfect lens involves finding the thicknesses @xmath35 and @xmath36 for material @xmath5 , and the thickness @xmath37 for material @xmath4 , such that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    the apparently simplest route to satisfying the perfect - lens condition is to ensure that the matrixes @xmath42 and @xmath43 commute for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "a straightforward calculation reveals that holds for the reference frame @xmath6 when @xmath47 in particular , since the conditions and hold for arbitrary @xmath11 , the canonical perfect lens is lorentz covariant .",
    "thus , not only is a perfect lens comprising slabs of vacuum , anti  vacuum , and vacuum lorentz covariant , but combinations of linear , homogeneous , and orthorhombic mediums @xmath5 and @xmath4 can be found such that a perfect lens made thereof is also lorentz covariant .",
