    "it has been shown in @xcite that the scaling exponent of any binary - input memoryless symmetric channel ( bmsc ) with @xmath8 lies between 3.579 and 4.714 , where the upper bound @xmath10 was shown by an explicit construction of polar codes ( see  @xcite for a looser upper bound @xmath36 ) .",

    "therefore , we are motivated to study the scaling exponent of polar codes for bmcs with cost constraints , and in particular eh cost constraints .",
    "our main result shows that for the binary - input eh channel which can also be viewed as a bmc subject to additional eh cost constraints , @xmath10 remains to be a valid upper bound on the scaling exponent of polar codes .",
    "our result thus implies that the eh constraints do not worsen the rate of convergence to capacity ( as quantified by the scaling exponent ) if polar codes are employed .",
    "this main result is proved by leveraging the following three existing results : scaling exponent analyses for bmscs @xcite , construction of polar codes designed for binary - input memoryless asymmetric channels @xcite , and the save - and - transmit strategy for eh channels @xcite .",
    "our overarching strategy is to design the energy - saving phase to be sufficiently short so as not to affect the scaling exponent , yet long enough so that the error probability of the resultant code is not severely degraded relative to the case without eh constraints .",
