    "<S> only a small contribution of @xmath59 is left after renormalization for @xmath60 , and it goes to zero in the limit of @xmath61 .    </S>",

    "<S> this fact tells us the reason why it was believed that higgs mechanism was indispensable for massive gauge bosons . a loop of the @xmath15 state has a symmetry factor @xmath68 , because it is effectively a real scalar field @xmath54 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the ghost loop has factor @xmath69 , which is twice as much as needed . </S>",
    "<S> this excessive correction is inevitable because anti - commuting field can not have kinetic term of the form @xmath70 , but only @xmath71 is possible . to eliminate this overcorrection , </S>",
    "<S> another unphysical field of mass @xmath29 is required . </S>",
    "<S> that is the higgs field .    even in the limit of @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the ghosts give twice excessive correction over the effect from negative norm states ( i.e.  @xmath15 states ) . </S>",
    "<S> what does it eliminate ? </S>",
    "<S> originally , ghost fields are introduced as a trick to make only picking transverse polarizations up consistent@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the ghosts should be canceling not only @xmath15 states but also @xmath23 states .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , the amplitude of scattering of particles giving rise to final state that include @xmath23 state does not vanish even in @xmath73 limit . </S>",

    "<S> the amplitude gets i m^ ^*_(k_1 ) ^*_(k_2 ) & = & - ig^2 ^*_(k_1 ) m^-1 f_abc ( k_1 ^ 2 g^- k_1^k_1 ^ - m^2 g^ ) & & d_(k_3 ) |v(p_+ ) t_c _ u(p ) , where we have used v _ k_2^ = - ( k_1 ^ 2 g _ </S>",

    "<S> still , @xmath26 states will not appear in our theory , since our propagator ( [ prop ] ) does not include @xmath26 polarization of mass @xmath27 , and @xmath15 states are too heavy to appear . </S>",
    "<S> now let us calculate the amplitude for two longitudinal final bosons . for calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we define @xmath86 with this , we have ^l_(k_1 ) ^l_(k_2 ) = -k_1 k_2/m^2 + ^l_(k_1 ) k_2/m + k_1 ^l _ ( k_2)/m + ^b_(k_1 ) ^b_(k_2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we already calculated that the second and the third term is zero , and the fourth term is negligible in @xmath73 limit , since @xmath87 is proportional to m. then we get m^ ^l*_(k_1 ) </S>",
    "<S> ^l*_(k_2 ) = - m^ k_1k_2/m^2 , and the amplitude of the final state being two @xmath23-polarized bosons is finite and equal to ( [ ss ] ) in the @xmath73 limit . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the probability of having @xmath23 state particles is finite as @xmath73 , since @xmath88 keeps constant even though elements of @xmath89 get infinitely large in this limit . ) </S>",
    "<S> now we see that the ghosts are eliminating this appearance of @xmath23 states too by that excessive factor @xmath90 .    only when @xmath91 , it is possible to remove not only @xmath15 states but also @xmath23 states from the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why it was possible only for massless cases to quantize gauge theories using ghosts . </S>",
    "<S> let us see it in an actual calculation . </S>",
    "<S> for the states with momentum @xmath92 , the transverse polarization vectors are @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> if we boost these state by @xmath95 into @xmath21 direction , their momentum gets @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> then the polarization vector @xmath93 is boosted into @xmath97 where @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not transversely polarized in this lorenz frame since its spatial component is not orthogonal to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> using the longitudinal and transverse polarization vectors of this frame ^l(k ) & = & 1 m ( |k| , ) , ^t(k ) & = & 1|k| ( 0 , k_3 , 0 , -k_1 ) , vector @xmath99 is decomposed as = m k_1 |k| ^l + ^t . </S>",
    "<S> [ mix ] thus , when the theory is massive , transverse polarization will be mixed with @xmath23 polarization by boosting , and then we can not make covariant theory without @xmath23 states . only when the theory is massless , it is possible to remove @xmath23 states by hand , because the coefficient of @xmath100 in ( [ mix ] ) goes to zero </S>",
    "<S> . then the conventional gauge theory with ghosts is consistent despite its excessive correction that eliminates @xmath23 states .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we see that two different kinds of gauge theories are possible when @xmath91 . both of the theories satisfy unitarity and have positive norms and positivity of energy . </S>",
    "<S> one kind is the conventional massless theories with ghosts only . </S>",
    "<S> the other is @xmath73 limit of our theory , which includes @xmath23 states with finite probability . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath73 limit in the conventional higgsed gauge theories with fixed higgs mass gives the same as the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the former are isolated theories , i.e.  they are possible only when @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are possible for general @xmath27 including @xmath73 limit . since both satisfy physical requirements , determining which is correct needs experimentation .    </S>",
    "<S> it has long been thought that proving quark confinement in qcd is very difficult . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that this difficulty comes from choosing wrong one of the two theories . </S>",
    "<S> we think that lattice qcd agrees with our theory , because the continuum limit in the lattice theories is essentially taking @xmath72 limit for massive theories on the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 polarization states may be restated as helicity@xmath101 states . </S>",
    "<S> we now know that these states have finite probability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even in such theories as gravity and supersymmetry , we should consider adopting other helicity states than the highest and lowest helicity states .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the forms of mass terms that were impossible before are possible in our theory . </S>",
    "<S> for example , all the gauge bosons in a representation of @xmath3 could not have the same mass except for @xmath102 in the conventional theories . to restore the physical freedoms which were removed by the ghost fields , we need @xmath103 higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> since higgs field in the fundamental representation has only @xmath104 real freedoms , it is impossible for all the gauge bosons to have mass except for @xmath102 ( higgs - kibble model ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs field is in adjoint representation , the gauge boson related to the unbroken generator will remain massless . </S>",
    "<S> our theory , however , does not have such limitation related to higgs mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> if we apply our method to the electroweak theory@xcite , we obtain a renormalizable theory , which gives the same physical results as the conventional higgsed theory under the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> our lagrangian is _ std & = & - 1 4 ( _ a_- _ a_- ig [ a _ , a _ ] ) ^2 -1 4 ( _ b_- _ b_)^2[lstd ] + & & - 1 2 ( _ a^a)^2 - 1 2 ( ^b_)^2 + 1 2 m_w^2 ( ( a^1_)^2 + ( a^2_)^2 + ( a^3_- _ w b_)^2 ) , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are @xmath32 and @xmath107 gauge fields respectively , @xmath108 is weak boson mass , and @xmath109 is weinberg angle . </S>",
    "<S> unitarity and renormalizability are obvious in this theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we do nt have negative norm states in this theory ( [ lstd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us call the unbroken @xmath110 gauge symmetry @xmath111 and the corresponding gauge boson  photon \" . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 polarization states of other gauge bosons will not have any effect , because they are simply heavy as is the case of higgs - kibble model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the photon @xmath15 states and @xmath23 states will be neither emitted nor absorbed as they did nt in qed , because the breaking of @xmath111 is proportional to @xmath112 , and negligible when @xmath113 is very large .    </S>",
    "<S> this theory ( [ lstd ] ) agrees with the conventional higgsed electroweak theory when the energy level is much lower than the higgs mass @xmath114 and @xmath113 is very large . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between these two theories in the @xmath115 gauge is the ghost and higgs fields . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs fields and heavier ghosts will not appear because of their heavy mass @xmath116 and @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the massless ghost corresponding to photon will be cancelled with the @xmath15 states and @xmath23 states owing to brs symmetry@xcite related to @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , </S>",
    "<S> the two theories agree in that @xmath15 and @xmath23 states will have no physical effect .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us consider the letponic part of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the trouble is that the fermion mass terms explicitly break @xmath0 symmetry . in the conventional understanding </S>",
    "<S> , brs symmetry should be conserved to prevent appearance of negative norm states . </S>",
    "<S> then , consistent theories are obtained@xcite only when we introduced mass terms via the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , our theory do nt need such mechanism and may simply introduce fermion mass terms , because the negative norm states are ruled out by simply giving unphysically large mass .    99    t. d. lee , c.n . </S>",
