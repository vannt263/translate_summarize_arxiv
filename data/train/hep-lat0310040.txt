    "a direct calculation of hadronic properties from qcd is a fundamental objective in particle physics .",
    "strong correlations among quarks make a reliable analytic calculation difficult even for basic properties of hadrons such as the mass spectrum and decay constants . so far numerical simulation based on the lattice formulation of qcd",
    "is the only reliable way toward this goal .",
    "a systematic study of lattice qcd carrying out both the chiral and continuum extrapolations requires a huge amount of computations , however .",
    "the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations have been performing a series of large scale simulations of qcd adopting the fastest computers available .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration have been mainly using the cp - pacs computer . a dedicated parallel computer with the peak performance of 614 gflops .",
    "the cp - pacs was designed and developed in 1996 at the center for computational physics , university of tsukuba @xcite .",
    "the main engine for the jlqcd collaboration is the supercomputers at the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) .",
    "the central computer since 2000 is the hitachi sr-8000/f1 with 100 nodes achieving the peak speed of 1.2 tflops @xcite .    as the first step , the cp - pacs collaboration carried out an extensive study of qcd in the quenched approximation , in which the effects of dynamical quark pair creations and annihilations are suppressed @xcite . performing the first well - controlled chiral and continuum extrapolations on lattices with the spatial extent of about 3 fm ,",
    "the limitation of the quenched approximation was clearly proven : the light hadron mass spectrum deviates from the experiment by o(10% ) .",
    "the next natural step is to incorporate the effects of dynamical @xmath0 , @xmath1 quarks ( two flavor full qcd ) .",
    "the results of systematic studies by the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations @xcite show that the discrepancies in the hadron mass spectrum observed in the quenched study are largely reduced by the dynamical @xmath0 , @xmath1 quarks .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of dynamical quarks .    in two flavor simulations , however ,",
    "the third @xmath2 quark is treated in a quenched approximation yet . on the other hand",
    ", we do expect that contribution of dynamical @xmath2 quark is not small because its mass is of the same order of magnitude as a typical energy scale of gluon dynamics : @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , introduction of the dynamical @xmath2 quark in the simulation is the last major step left towards a fully realistic simulation of qcd .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : computers ]    the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations have started a systematic study of three flavor full qcd .",

    "summing up these numbers , we may use about 2.5 tflops to simulate three flavor qcd .    in this paper ,",

    "with the wilson - type ( staggered - type ) lattice quarks , the exact hmc algorithm exists only for the cases of even ( four times integer ) number of flavors . because an exact algorithm for odd number of flavors was not known before , inexact r - algorithm has been adopted in previous studies of three flavor qcd . to avoid possible unexpected systematic errors , however , it is highly desirable to adopt an exact algorithm for large scale simulations .",
    "recently , several exact algorithms for odd flavors have been proposed : the multi - boson algorithm @xcite and the polynomial hybrid monte carlo ( phmc ) algorithm @xcite , both based on polynomial approximation for the quark matrix and for its determinant .",
    "we adopt the phmc algorithm extending it to clover - improved wilson quarks .",
    "we made a systematic test of several variants of the phmc algorithm @xcite .",
    "we found that , with appropriate improvements , the phmc algorithm is equally efficient as the hmc algorithm for the case of two - flavor qcd .    from this study , we decide to adopt the phmc algorithm for the @xmath2 quark and the hmc algorithm for degenerate @xmath0 , @xmath1 quarks .",
    "note that , because the @xmath2 quark is heavy , the problem of negative determinant at very small quark masses is automatically avoided .",
    "together with additional improvements , we find that the overall cpu time to simulate one trajectory of three flavor qcd is only about 1.5 times more than that for two flavor qcd using our previous hmc code at the same @xmath0 , @xmath1 quark masses .",
