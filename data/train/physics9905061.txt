    "electron acceleration has been an important issue in plasma physics and astrophysics . in solar physics , for instance , the acceleration of electrons as well as of ions has received a great deal of attention ; in solar flares , gamma rays with energies of several tens of mev , which are emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high - energy electrons , are often observed @xcite , @xcite . in astrophysics , much more energetic electrons have been discussed . from the observations of x - rays and gamma rays ,",

    "furthermore , the transverse electric field in the shock wave can accelerate all particles of all kinds of ( minority ) heavy ions to nearly the same speed @xcite , @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : xyzg ] displays time variations of ( @xmath265 ) , @xmath18 , @xmath36 , and @xmath266 of electrons in a shock with @xmath267 ; ( @xmath265 ) is the @xmath56 position in the wave frame .",
    "the lengths are normalized to the electron skin depth @xmath268 .",

    "two typical examples are presented here .",
    "the thick lines show an electron that was accelerated , and the thin lines represent an electron that was not accelerated ; even the low - energy electron here has energy @xmath270 in the shock region and @xmath271 behind the shock . in all of the four panels , the low- and high - energy electrons both",
    "have small - amplitude , cyclotron oscillations with short periods , @xmath272 ; note that the cyclotron period depends on @xmath266 as well as the field strength @xmath273 . at the same time",

    "( simulations show that this period increases with @xmath7 . to observe this oscillation as many times as possible ,",
    "we have chosen here the case where @xmath7 is not so large . ) for comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] , we show the times corresponding to points b , c , d , and e. from the long - period oscillation of ( @xmath276 ) in the top panel , we see that the electron that will become high energy is reflected and then trapped by the shock wave . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantity ( @xmath276 ) of the low - energy electron keeps decreasing , which means that this particle passes through the shock region without strong interactions .",
    "the second panel shows that the @xmath18 position of the accelerated electron also oscillates , while the third one shows that @xmath36 increases rapidly after the reflection .",
    "the average value of velocity @xmath277 over the period from @xmath278 to 400 is @xmath279 , and the value of @xmath277 at maximum @xmath266 is @xmath280 .",
    "the maximum @xmath266 in the bottom panel is @xmath281 .    by the lorentz transformation of these data",
    ", we can find @xmath282 and @xmath90 in the wave frame . at the time and position of maximum @xmath7 ,",
    "they are @xmath283 @xmath284 and @xmath285 @xmath286 .",
    "this confirms our statement in the previous section that @xmath287 is the dominant component in @xmath282 there ; i.e. , @xmath288 .",
    "according to the theory , ( [ eq:230a ] ) , electron energies can be extremely high at some angles and shock speeds . to examine this prediction ,",
    "we have carried out several simulations with different values of the propagation angle @xmath289 , keeping other parameters unchanged ; @xmath290 , @xmath231 , and @xmath291 .",
    "figure [ fig : angle ] shows the maximum value of @xmath7 as a function of the propagation angle @xmath289 . here",
    "the electron energy takes the highest value at the angle @xmath292 . for these simulation parameters ,",
    "( [ eq:230a ] ) predicts that @xmath7 takes a peak value at @xmath293 .",
    "thus the theory and simulation are in good agreement .",

    "( [ eq:230a ] ) predicts that @xmath7 takes large values for @xmath297 .",
    "again , the theory and simulation are in good agreement .",
    "we have studied electron motion in a shock wave propagating obliquely to a magnetic field .",
    "first , we analytically discussed electron motion in an oblique shock wave .",
    "it is pointed out that , if an electron is reflected near the end of a large - amplitude pulse , it would gain a great deal of energy from the electric field formed in the wave . the condition for the reflection",
    "is then examined .",
    "further , the maximum energy of a reflected electron is estimated , and its dependence on plasma parameters is discussed .",
    "next , we investigated the shock evolution and associated electron acceleration by using a one - dimensional , relativistic , electromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion and electron dynamics .",
    "it was shown that an oblique shock can produce ultra - relativistic electrons ; lorentz factors with @xmath0 have been observed . as the theory predicts , at certain propagation angles",
    "electron energies become extremely high . the electron reflection and",
    "resultant acceleration takes place when the wave amplitude is large and the magnetic field is rather strong , @xmath298 .    in the present paper ,",
    "strong electron acceleration has been demonstrated . as future work",
    ", it would be desirable to develop further the quantitative theory for large - amplitude oblique waves .",
    "the evaluation of the electric field strength along the magnetic field will be especially important , which will enable us to estimate the maximum energy more accurately .",
    "from the view point of nonlinear wave propagation , motion of trapped electrons and their effects on the wave evolution are also quite interesting .",
    "we here describe relations among the physical variables , using the approximation appropriate for low - frequency magnetosonic waves with small amplitudes ( for the details of the calculations , see ref .",
    "we assume quasi neutrality , @xmath299 and use the following stretched variables @xmath300 @xmath301 ( @xmath302 is the wave propagation speed in the long - wavelength limit in a finite beta plasma ) and expansion @xmath303",
    "@xmath304 @xmath305 then , we can express the lowest order perturbations in terms of @xmath306 as @xmath307 ( n _ 1 / n _ 0 )   , \\label{eq : rq6}\\ ] ] @xmath308 here @xmath309 is the sound speed , @xmath310 with @xmath311 ( @xmath312 or @xmath313 ) the specific heat ratio and @xmath314 the equilibrium pressure .",
    "we can obtain kdv equation by proceeding to the next order , @xmath315 .    the relations ( [ eq : rq6 ] ) and ( [ eq : rq7 ] ) are valid , even when the wave profile is not soliton - like .",
    "that is , perturbations propagating in the same direction with @xmath316 have the relations ( [ eq : rq6 ] ) and ( [ eq : rq7 ] ) .",
    "for a nonrelativistic , small - amplitude oblique magnetosonic wave , the electric field parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath8 , has been analytically obtained @xcite . however , for a large - amplitude wave , it will be quite difficult to obtain @xmath8 in a rigorous manner . here , on the basis of a simple physical picture , we will give a rough estimate of the parallel electric field @xmath8 in a relativistic , large - amplitude , oblique shock wave .",
    "further , by using it , we will obtain the maximum value of the quantity @xmath99 .",
    "we consider in the wave frame . in the fluid model , the equation of motion",
    "may be written as @xmath317 here the pressure term is neglected .",
    "the subscript @xmath318 refers to ions @xmath319 or electrons @xmath320 . the time derivative @xmath321 is defined as @xmath322 we denote by @xmath323 the unit vector along the magnetic field",
    ". then multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) by @xmath323 , we have @xmath324    let @xmath325 be the time when a fluid element is at the leading edge of the shock ( the location where the shock profile begins to sharply rise ) and @xmath326 be the time when it is at the point @xmath196 ; @xmath196 is the location where the electric potential and magnetic field take their maximum values .",
    "then , integrating from @xmath325 to @xmath326 , we find for the ions @xmath327 here the bracket indicates the mean value over the time period ( @xmath328 ) , and @xmath329 is the shock width .",
    "we have a relation ( @xmath330 . for oblique shocks , @xmath329 will be of the order of the ion inertial length , @xmath331 .",
    "the velocity at time @xmath325 is @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is the unit vector in the @xmath56 direction .",
    "the velocity @xmath334 will be slowed down by the longitudinal electric field .",
    "thus @xmath335 will be smaller in magnitude than @xmath336 . because @xmath243 is large at the point @xmath196 and @xmath337",
    ", the unit vector @xmath338 is nearly parallel to the @xmath108 direction .",
    "consequently , the inner product ( @xmath339 ) will be quite small ; here we neglect the @xmath108 component of @xmath340 .",
    "since the @xmath56 component of @xmath341 is given by @xmath342 , we have @xmath343 this gives the strength of the parallel electric field as @xmath344 because @xmath345 is smaller than @xmath294 , the range of @xmath346 is expected to be @xmath347 , except maybe for extremely strong shock waves .",
    "in fact , if we assume a simple time dependence of @xmath334 @xmath348 \\ \\ \\   \\mbox{for } \\ \\ \\   t _ 1 \\le t \\le t _ 2 , \\label{eq : vix}\\ ] ] with @xmath349 a constant ( @xmath350 ) , then , after integrating over time , we have @xmath351 .    the lorentz factor for",
    "the fluid ion will be close to unity",
    ". accordingly , for instance , if the ion fluid velocity @xmath352 is decreased to a value @xmath353 , then the value of the content in the parentheses would be about 1/4",
    ".    the electron speed will be @xmath354 when the electrons encounter the shock and will be close to the speed of light when they are at the point @xmath355 .",
    "if we assume that the electron velocity is nearly parallel to the field line in the shock region , then ( @xmath356 ) can be neglected .",
    "hence we have @xmath357 the second term on the left - hand side , @xmath358 , can be neglected compared with the first term @xmath359 .",
    "the ions and electrons will have nearly the same time period ( @xmath328 ) to keep charge neutrality .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : a7 ] ) in ( [ eq : a8 ] ) yields @xmath360 at @xmath361 , @xmath183 can be estimated as @xmath362 ( for reflected electrons the sign is reversed ) . for a large - amplitude shock ,",
