    "at sufficiently large angular distances from the centre of any galaxy image , the surface - brightness contribution due to the galaxy becomes , at some point , indistinguishable from the surface - brightness of the surrounding sky .",
    "the limit on reliable observation is determined primarily by the noise and often corresponds to those points at which the galaxy s surface brightness has fallen to several percent of the sky , though limits in the region of 0.1% of the sky are measurable on occasions .",
    "although total magnitudes are required for many astrophysical applications , it is therefore not possible to measure them directly .",
    "instead , estimates are normally obtained by means of extrapolating model profiles fitted to those parts of the galaxy - light profiles ( whether surface - brightness or integrated ) that can be measured reliably .",
    "however , galaxies of different morphological type have very different profile shapes , and a wide range of models have generally had to be invoked . in kron",
    "s ( 1980 ) system though , the flux due to a galaxy is measured to _ very _ large radial distances , so that different models do not need to be invoked .",
    "such a procedure has its advantages , but at the very large radial distances involved , the signal due to the galaxy is often such a small fraction of the noise that large random errors can not be avoided .",
    "an alternative approach to profile extrapolation is @xmath2-low - resolution imaging so that , in theory at least , all target galaxies essentially become point sources and yield images of almost identical structure .",
    "total magnitudes then become a simple function of the full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the image point - spread function . in practice",
    ", the fwhm of the point - spread function has to be much larger than the intrinsic angular sizes of the target galaxies for this method to yield reliable magnitudes .",
    "however , the wider the point - spread function is , the lower the mean surface - brightness of each image becomes and the greater the errors due to the noise become . in the compilation of their _ catalog of galaxies and clusters of galaxies _ , zwicky et al .",
    "( 1961 , 1963 , 1965 , 1966 , 1968 ) measured their total magnitudes visually from _ out - of - focus _ photographic plates .",
    "out - of - focus images generally have a complicated point - spread function , but as long as they exhibit little variation across a single plate or ccd frame , this should not be a problem .",
    "the new system presented in this paper combines both approaches .",
    "we believe that it can yield very large numbers of reliable total - magnitude measurements very efficiently , and that it is therefore particularly suitable for galaxy - survey work .",
    "in his pioneering study , hubble ( 1930 ) found that the surface - brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies ( which he measured along either the major or minor axes ) seemed to be well fitted by the law :    @xmath3    where an elliptical - galaxy profile can be uniquely described by two terms : @xmath4 ( a central surface brightness ) and @xmath5 ( a scale length ) .",
    "the main problem with this law is that its integrand with respect to @xmath6 diverges as @xmath6 increases , and it is therefore unsuitable for extrapolation to large @xmath6 .",
    "an alternative representation was proposed by de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) :    @xmath7\\},\\ ] ]    where an elliptical - galaxy profile can be uniquely specified by @xmath8 ( the effective radius which contains half the galaxy s light ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the surface brightness at @xmath10 .",
    "this representation has the advantage of a convergent integrand :    @xmath11    however , it has the disadvantage that strictly , the total luminosity needs to be known before the effective parameters can be evaluated .",
    "a move away from wholly empirical functions was made by king ( 1966 ) .",
    "king s models were constructed with tidally truncated globular star clusters in mind but have also been applied to elliptical galaxies .",
    "they assume that at all points within a stellar system , the frequency distribution of stars as a function of position and velocity can be described by an isothermal gaussian minus an offset . at any position within the system ,",
    "the offset is chosen so as to ensure that the frequency distribution is zero for stars with velocities equal to and in excess of the local escape velocity .",
    "this succeeds in reducing an otherwise infinite isothermal space distribution of stars to one with a finite radius .",
    "nevertheless , the empirical law of de vaucouleurs actually offers a better description of tidally unperturbed galaxies than does king s model .    despite the intricate structure exhibited by many spiral galaxies",
    ", it has long been realised , e.g. by de vaucouleurs ( 1958 ) that their smoothed light profiles could be separated into two components : a central component approximately obeying an @xmath12 law is raised varies considerably and is often much higher than 0.25 . ]",
    "( corresponding to the spheroidal bulge , denoted @xmath13 ) and a more extended component approximately obeying an exponential law ( corresponding to the disc , denoted @xmath14 ) :    @xmath15\\ } \\ ; + \\ ; \\sigma_{0,d } \\exp [ -(\\frac{r}{r_{0,d}})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 ( the central surface - brightness due to the disc alone ) and @xmath17 ( the scale length of the disc component ) uniquely describe the disc component .",
    "the contribution due to this exponential component decreases as one progresses from late - type spirals to earlier types , but is not completely absent from lenticular objects or even classical ellipticals .",
    "this trend in galaxy - profile characteristics from early through late types was exploited by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1976 , 1991 ) during the compilation of their _ second _ and _ third reference catalogs of bright galaxies _ ( hereunder rc2 and rc3 respectively ) .",
    "their elaborate and widely - used scheme for extrapolating both aperture and surface - photometry measurements of galaxies , in order to estimate total magnitudes , is known as the @xmath1 system .",
    "although the @xmath1 system has been used successfully to extrapolate the profiles of well resolved images of classical galaxies , its applicability to dwarf galaxies ( as well as ellipticals intermediate between true dwarfs and true classicals ) and to low - resolution images ( of all galaxy types ) is questionable .",
    "there appear to be at least three major limitations to the @xmath1 system , the main consequences of which are summarised by young ( 1997 ) and will be dealt with in more detail by young et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . + ( 1 ) the scheme does not take into account the possibility that galaxies with profiles steeper than exponentials exist .",
    "as is evident from young & currie ( 1994 , 1995 ) many dwarfs have profiles that _ are _ steeper than exponentials and some even have profiles as steep as gaussians .",
    "these objects are therefore beyond the scope of the @xmath1 system which necessarily over - estimates their luminosities .",
    "+ ( 2 ) a morphological classification must be attempted first in order to be able to select the most appropriate extrapolation model for each galaxy concerned .",
    "this is normally done by eye .",
    "many non - classical elliptical galaxies ( including some with some characteristics of irregulars ) e.g.  ic  3475 , 3349 , 3457 and 3461 , were classified as @xmath12-law objects by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1976 , 1991 ) and their profiles extrapolated accordingly .",
    "in fact ic  3475 has a very exponential profile as demonstrated by vigroux et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , and the other three objects listed have profiles slightly steeper than an exponential as demonstrated by young & currie ( in press ) .",
    "this means that whilst these objects could be accommodated by the @xmath1 system if it were treated as objects with exponential profiles , their luminosities were in fact severely over - estimated by of the order of 100% in both the rc2 and the rc3 ( young , 1997 ; young et al .",
    ", in preparation ) because of limitations in the morphological typing procedure .",
    "the need to estimate the profile shape by eye before an extrapolation can be performed is therefore a serious short - coming of the @xmath1 system .",
    "+ ( 3 ) no account is taken of atmospheric or instrumental effects that degrade the resolution of a galaxy image and thereby modify its _ measurable _ surface - brightness profile .",
    "clearly a low - resolution image of a particular galaxy is likely to have a more gaussian - like profile than is a high - resolution image of the same galaxy .",
    "this makes the @xmath1 system difficult to apply consistently to images of different resolution and even to images of almost identical galaxies at widely differing distances .",
    "a worthy alternative to the @xmath1 system has long been the kron ( 1980 ) system , in which the rate of growth of the signal with respect to the signal itself is considered as a function of radial distance from the centre of each galaxy image .",
    "the light is then measured within a circular region of a radius corresponding to the point at which the logarithmic derivative of the light growth curve becomes smaller than the _ same _ upper limit for all target galaxies . in practice",
    "there are strong constraints on the suitable values for this limit , and the range of suitable values generally require an aperture of radius equal to about twice the effective ( half - light ) radius .",
    "the fraction of the total light within this aperture ( which in practice is typically of the order of 95% ) is then assumed to be constant for all galaxies , and total magnitudes can be obtained by extrapolating the measured aperture magnitude values by the same amount ( which in practice simply means adding typically about @xmath180.05 mag .",
    "to each aperture magnitude ) .",
    "the kron system has two major advantages over the @xmath1 system , namely that the magnitude measurement process is independent of galaxy morphological type and that atmospheric effects that degrade image resolution and distort galaxy luminosity profile shapes are taken into account .",
    "however , it does have at least three major drawbacks",
    ". + ( 1 ) large random errors are present due to having to measure luminosity growth curves and [ even harder ] their derivatives , out to very large radial distances where the signal due to the galaxy is a very small fraction of the noise .",
    "note that the kron system does not take the signal - to - noise ratio as a function of radial distance into account at all .",
    "this can be a particularly serious problem when dealing with low - surface - brightness galaxies such as dwarfs . + ( 2 )",
    "the need for very large apertures restricts which objects can be measured in crowded fields when undesirable galaxy or stellar images lie adjacent to the target objects . for this reason",
    "the kron system has mainly been applied to field galaxies rather than cluster ones .",
    "+ ( 3 ) unlike the @xmath1 system which is based on aperture and surface photometry measurements that can be extracted from the literature in their published form , one can not compute kron - system total magnitudes without access to the original digital - image data .",
    "despite the existence of the elaborate @xmath1 and kron systems , most large machine surveys of galaxies have , understandably , adopted simpler algorithms for extrapolating large numbers of isophotal magnitudes to totals . in the apm southern - sky survey of maddox et al .",
    "( 1990 ) the majority of galaxy images were assumed to be seeing dominated , and therefore to have approximately gaussian profiles ( on average at least ) .",
    "this was a particularly efficient method , as knowledge of an isophotal magnitude and the angular area of that isophote was sufficient to specify the parameters of a gaussian profile uniquely ; as described in detail in maddox et al .",
    "however , such an approach is only applicable to unresolved galaxy images from sufficiently small and/or sufficiently distant objects .",
    "in addition to the extrapolation systems discussed in this section , there are of course others .",
    "however , such systems have generally only been applied to limited galaxy samples of a particular morphological type .",
    "this system was first adopted by young ( 1994 ) and young & currie ( in press ) in the compilation of their _ virgo photometry catalogue _ ( hereunder vpc ) ; as well as by young & currie ( 1995 ) , drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and young ( 1997 ) ; who all quote @xmath0-system total magnitude values from the vpc .",
    "the @xmath0 system is a system for extrapolating surface - brightness profiles of sufficiently low resolution , to @xmath20 where @xmath6 is reduced radial distance ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this means that high - resolution images ( those of non - nucleated dwarf and intermediate ellipticals excepted ) must be smoothed sufficiently _ prior to _ any surface - brightness profile being parametrized , but has the important advantage that low - resolution images can be measured even if their profiles are significantly distorted by e.g.   seeing effects or poor sampling .",
    "although alternative smoothing functions can be used , we recommend a [ radially - symmetric two - dimensional ] gaussian function .    in order to generate",
    "an extrapolated total @xmath0-system magnitude from a low - resolution surface - brightness profile , srsic s ( 1968 ) law is adopted :    @xmath22,\\ ] ]    in which @xmath23 is the surface brightness in linear units of luminous flux density at @xmath6 , @xmath24 is the central surface brightness and @xmath25 is the angular scalelength .",
    "the extrapolated central surface brightness is therefore : @xmath26 in mag.arcsec@xmath27 , whence the equivalent expression in logarithmic surface - brightness units is :    @xmath28    enabling values of @xmath29 and @xmath25 to be obtained by linear regression when the optimum value of @xmath30 has been derived .",
    "the analytical solution    @xmath31    then yields an estimate of the total luminous flux within the pass - band concerned .",
    "clearly , this generalisation incorporates not only the @xmath12 law ( @xmath32 ) but also exponentials ( @xmath33 ) and gaussians ( @xmath34 ) as well as both intermediate and more extreme cases .",
    "although it is a one - component model , galaxies exhibiting two - component [ or yet more complicated ] structure can be comfortably accommodated by this scheme after their images have been smoothed sufficiently .    for the benefit of readers wishing to use this extrapolation system ,",
    "a listing of the relevant fortran code can be found in appendix a. the subroutine extrapol.for : ( 1 ) increments the profile - curvature parameter @xmath30 , and attempts ( for each @xmath30 ) to fit srsic s law to a surface - brightness profile defined by elliptical isophotes ( @xmath35 , @xmath36(@xmath6 ) , @xmath37 ) ; ( 2 ) quantifies the quality of the fit obtained for each value of @xmath30 ; and ( 3 ) integrates the volume beneath the surface defined by the best - fitting profile form ( after rotation through 2@xmath38 radians about @xmath39 ) to @xmath20 , thereby yielding a total - magnitude estimate .",
    "it calls the subroutine fit and the function gammln , both from press et al .",
    "note that fit actually fits a straight line of the form @xmath40 , _ not _ one of the form @xmath41 .",
    "also , in order to reduce the dependence on other subroutines and functions , we removed the lines : + q=1 . and q = gammq(0.5*(ndata-2),0.5*chi2 ) , + from this subroutine and removed the parameter q from line 1 .    although @xmath0-system total magnitudes can not generally be derived directly from high resolution surface photometry of bright galaxies in the literature , they can be derived from surface photometry of virtually all galaxies fainter than @xmath42 mag .  provided that the resolution of the photometry [ after smoothing ] is coarser than about 4.-0.27em-0.02em5 ( fwhm ) . in the compilation of their vpc ,",
    "young & currie ( in press ) found that a reasonable amount of smoothing of their plate - scan data was necessary simply in order to prevent the fragmentation of images during the image segmentation process .",
    "they found that the minimum degree of smoothing required by the segmentation software was actually sufficient for the derivation of @xmath0-system total magnitudes from the surface - brightness profiles of all unsaturated galaxies with enough isophotes above the limiting one for the fits to be performed .",
    "in this section , we test the stability of the @xmath0 system with respect to morphological type , size of atmospheric seeing disc , degree of smoothing and limiting isophote .",

    "each digital image was embedded in a very much larger array of pixels ( in which each pixel in the surrounding grid was set to zero ) before any convolution was performed .",
    "the moffat function was chosen on this occasion in order to simulate both the effect of poor seeing on nearby objects and the effect of average seeing on distant objects .",
    "note that in adopting a moffat function here , we are actually applying a very much more stringent test on the stability of the @xmath0 system than we would have been had we adopted the gaussian function that we recommend for the purpose of smoothing .",
    "this is because the moffat function is a much more complicated function than the gaussian one , being similar to the gaussian at small radial distances but falling off much more slowly at larger radial distances .",
    "godwin s ( 1976 ) image - segmentation software , as outlined by carter & godwin ( 1979 ) , was used in order to fit elliptical isophotes of 0.25 mag.arcsec@xmath27 separation ( each defined by a mean radius @xmath6 , an ellipticity and a position angle ) to all of the synthetic low - resolution images . the isophotes were weighted according to the simple algorithm : @xmath63 for @xmath64 or @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting synthetic surface - brightness profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "[ profs ] together with the best fitting srsic model profiles ; whilst the corresponding model parameters are tabulated in table  [ fits ] , which also lists those model parameters obtained when different limiting isophotes were applied .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ profs ] and table  [ fits ] , srsic s model yields very consistent results for all of the synthetic images except for the two highest resolution images of the classical elliptical ( which , at 12th magnitude is in fact a very bright object ) and the highest resolution image of the dwarf elliptical . in these three",
    "cases one - component profile models appear not to be completely adequate .",
    "however , once the resolution of a galaxy image has been degraded sufficiently , even if purely by seeing effects , the @xmath0-system total magnitudes obtained do appear to be stable typically to a couple of percent or so , irrespective of morphological type , the size of the seeing disc , or the limiting isophote  provided that the limiting isophote is not so bright that there are too few isophotes to fit .",
    "note that under normal circumstances , when the seeing disc is _ not _ almost as large as the galaxy image itself and the resolution of the image can be deliberately degraded by convolution with a gaussian function ( or even a simple hanning function ) , the level of stability with respect to image resolution must be even greater than this .",
    "this is because the synthetic surface - brightness profile obtained by convolving any galaxy image with a gaussian function of large fwhm , must be more gaussian than the original profile and therefore more likely to be well described by srsic s law ( as the gaussian function , unlike the moffat function for example , can be perfectly described by srsic s law ) .",
    "we also tested the system for stability with respect to different weighting schemes for the isophotes , and found that whilst altering the weightings had very significant effects on the @xmath56 values obtained , and reasonably significant effects on which best - fitting parameters were adopted , the effects on the total magnitude values obtained were only at the one or two per cent level  for realistic weighting schemes at least .",

    "radii were then computed for further [ circular ] isophotes that were multiples of 0.25 mag.m@xmath27 fainter than the brightest isophote .",
    "the results of attempts to fit not only srsic s law , but also the gaussian and @xmath12 laws , to the brighter isophotes of these model profiles are shown in table  [ fitmoffat ] .",
    "for these fits , the adopted weighting scheme was : @xmath82 , where @xmath29 is the peak central surface brightness at @xmath39 in units of mag.m@xmath27 .",
    "note that although moffat did not quote plate - scale values , we were still able to investigate the _ fractional _ differences between the extrapolated total - luminosity estimates and the true luminosities represented by the two - dimensional radially - symmetric moffat surfaces .    from table",
    "[ fitmoffat ] , it is clear that , as one would expect , the @xmath12 law always severely over - estimates the light due to a point - spread function represented by a moffat profile .",
    "it is also evident from the same table that an extrapolation of srsic s model generally yields a significantly better estimate of the total light due to a typical point - spread function than does an extrapolation of a strictly gaussian model .    in the above comparisons",
    ", we have of course applied a very stringent test to @xmath0-system and gaussian - law extrapolations , by invoking pure moffat functions to describe the unresolved images . in practice , as in the compilation of the vpc for example , the structures of the unresolved images should really be described by the product of three functions , the sampling function a moffat function and the smoothing function , all convolved with one another .",
    "provided that the smoothing function is a single - component function that falls off steeply with increasing radial distance , such as a gaussian function , better results should be obtainable using srsic s model ( or even a strictly gaussian model ) than those tabulated in table  [ fitmoffat ] .",
    "this is because a pure moffat function is less amenable to being described by a srsic function ( or the gaussian case thereof ) than is a moffat function that has been deliberately smoothed .",
    "the @xmath0 system is therefore applicable to point - source galaxy images as well as resolved - galaxy images . while it can not offer a perfect fit to a typical unsmoothed point - spread function ,",
    "it does generally offer significantly better results than those that can be obtained by invoking a purely gaussian model .",
    "we have presented a new procedure for obtaining total - magnitude estimates from unsaturated galaxy images .",
    "this method involves first smoothing two - dimensional digital images numerically ( ideally convolving them with a two - dimensional radially symmetric gaussian function of sufficient fwhm ) , in order to produce lower - resolution images , which are then parameterised using elliptical isophotes .",
    "the rationale behind this is that even the faintest isophotes of the synthetic lower - resolution images ( which can not be measured accurately or at all in practice ) become distorted in a predictable manner by the smoothing process .",
    "the second stage involves modeling the resulting surface - brightness profiles with srsic functions , and extrapolating the best - fitting functions to infinite radial distances .",
    "we have also demonstrated the system s high level of stability with respect to galaxy morphological type , limiting isophote and the size of the seeing disc ( and thereby degree of smoothing too [ provided one does not under - smooth ] , as typical smoothing functions cause distortions that are more easily accommodated by the fitting procedure than those distortions caused purely by seeing effects ) .",
