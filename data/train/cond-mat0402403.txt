    "last , we find that the zero - temperature cross - over in magnetic field is inextricably linked to the existence of an inverted specific heat anomaly within the vortex liquid phase@xcite . the latter accounts for the experimental observation of a similar thermal anomaly inside the vortex liquid phase of the high - temperature superconductor ybco@xcite .",

    "noticably absent from the above calculations is the effect of magnetic coupling between planar vortices across layers .",
    "this in general reduces the entanglement of vortex lines across layers , and it will therefore increase the inter - layer phase coherence , eqs .",

    "@xcite shows , however , that the effect of magnetic coupling can be accounted for by a renormalization up in the 2d disorder scale , @xmath58 .",
    "last , a sharp and possibly first - order disorder - driven decoupling transition has been found numerically at zero temperature for the vortex lattice with magnetic interactions , but with no josephson coupling@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the disorder - driven dimensional crossover found here in the zero - temperature limit survives the addition of weak magnetic coupling .",
    "we conclude that random point pinning of the vortex lattice in layered superconductors results in a 2d-3d crossover transition at low temperature that separates strong from weak superconductivity across layers ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the disorder - driven phenomenon suggests the following physical picture : although the tension for a line of dislocations in the defective vortex lattice is null on both sides of the crossover , the scale of the roughness in the line is large compared to the inter - layer spacing in the 3d phase , while it is of order or less than the inter - layer spacing in the quasi-2d phase .",
    "scaling suggests that such quenched - in disorder is established first at separations between layers of order @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the physical anisotropy parameter ."
