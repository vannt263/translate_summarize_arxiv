    "traditionally , spiral galaxies have three main components : a dynamically hot bulge , a dynamically cold disk ( which can sometimes be divided into `` thin '' and `` thick '' components ) , and a mysterious dark matter halo . however , measuring the mass of each component separately is a challenge , especially in a galaxy s extreme outer regions where the dark matter halo dominates . even in late - type spirals with minimal bulges ,",
    "the mass profiles of the dark halos can not be decoupled from the visible disk mass using rotation curves alone @xcite .",
    "most analyses have therefore relied on the `` maximal disk '' hypothesis , wherein the disk mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0 ) is assumed to be constant with radius , and as large as possible to account for the rotation in the inner parts of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "is the disk @xmath0 really constant and maximal ?",
    "perhaps the best way to break the disk - halo degeneracy is to measure the surface mass of a disk directly from the @xmath4  motions of stars . in systems where the primary stellar motion is circular ,",
    "the phase - space distribution of stars in the direction perpendicular to the plane is fixed by the disk s gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "for example , in the milky way , star counts and velocity measurements toward the galactic pole initially suggested that the stellar disk is roughly isothermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this were indeed the case , then the integrated face - on stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , would be related to the disk surface mass , @xmath5 , by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant , @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath9 is the scale height of the stars @xcite .",
    "since surveys of edge - on galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that @xmath9 is roughly constant with radius , measurements of @xmath1 can produce estimates of disk mass that are independent of a galaxy s rotation curve .",
    "absorption line studies have shown that , in the inner regions of spirals , @xmath1 generally follows the exponential law expected from a constant @xmath0 disk @xcite . however , these surveys were limited by surface brightness , and do not extend more than @xmath22  scale lengths from the nucleus . to probe the outer regions of disks , where the dark matter halo is more important , some other technique is required . planetary nebulae ( pne ) are ideal tools for this purpose : pne are extremely bright in [ ] , abundant out to @xmath105  disk scale lengths , measurable to @xmath22  km  s@xmath11  with fiber - fed spectrographs , and present in all stellar populations with ages between @xmath12 and @xmath13  yr . moreover",

    "the analysis of 140  pn velocities in the moderately inclined ( @xmath30 ) local group spiral m33 yielded a similarly surprising result : by assuming a constant scale - height for the galaxy s disk , @xcite concluded that the disk mass - to - light ratio actually increases with radius , going from @xmath31 in the inner regions to @xmath32 at @xmath33  kpc .",

    "before we can translate our pn velocities into disk mass , we need to adopt some form for the phase - space distribution of stars perpendicular to the disk .",
    "this is not an entirely settled question , even in the milky way .",
    "as described by @xcite , the vertical structure of stars in a galactic disk can be parameterized by a family of models @xmath54 which have isothermal ( @xmath55 ) and exponential ( @xmath56 ) distributions as their limiting cases . depending on the value of @xmath57 , poisson s equation",
    "yields different constants for the relationship between the disk mass surface density and the integrated face - on velocity dispersion .",
    "in other words , in equation  ( [ isothermal ] ) , @xmath58 has argued that the intermediate ( @xmath59 ) case best fits star counts in the milky way , especially at low @xmath4 , where the superposition of many stellar populations , each with their own value of @xmath1 , blend together . to take this blending into account , @xcite combined several isothermal components to find a result similar to the exponential case .",
    "however , when initial mass functions and star formation rates were considered , @xcite found that a single exponential was insufficient to model the galaxy s vertical structure .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that in a sample of 61 edge - on spirals , 60% have vertical distributions that are best fit by the sech@xmath60 law .",
    "however , unlike the milky way star counts , these measurements were the result of a fit to surface brightness , and therefore represent a solution that is weighted by luminosity ( actually , by the inverse of the stellar mass - to - light ratio ) , rather than the actual mass density of stars .",
    "while pn observations do not strictly sample mass , neither do they produce results that are luminosity - weighted .",
    "generally speaking , pne are excellent tracers of light , but only in populations where the mass - to - light ratio changes slowly with age , i.e. ,  in systems older than @xmath61  gyr @xcite .",
    "younger populations , which may dominate the luminosity of a galaxy , produce no planetary nebulae whatsoever .",
    "thus , the distribution of pne should be closer to one that is space - weighted , rather than one that is luminosity weighted .",
    "given these issues we chose to model our disks using an intermediate ( @xmath62 ) vertical distribution .",
    "this assumption increases our derived disk masses by 17% over the isothermal case , while decreasing it by @xmath63 compared to exponential distributions .    with the vertical distribution set , we next needed to establish the values of @xmath9 appropriate for our sample of galaxies .",
    "since all of our targets are low - inclination systems , their vertical scale heights are not directly observable .",
    "consequently , in order to constrain @xmath9 , we had to use correlations with other measurable quantities , such as disk scale length ( @xmath3 ) and disk surface brightness .",
    "several studies have investigated these trends , generally finding @xmath64 for large , non - interacting late - type spirals , such as those observed in our survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite have explored the behavior of @xmath65 versus hubble type .",
    "both studies find that , though later - type spirals generally have larger @xmath9 values than earlier type objects , they also have larger values of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , while scd galaxies have @xmath64 , the sab systems have ratios as low as @xmath25 . finally , @xcite have examined the dependence of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath66-band central surface brightness , @xmath67 , finding @xmath68 this relation has a substantial amount of scatter , but if we use the radial surface brightness profiles of the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) large galaxy atlas websiteto estimate @xmath67 , then the implied values of @xmath65 for the galaxies in our sample range from @xmath25.6 to @xmath27.5 .",
    "table  [ tabhz ] summarizes our initial estimates for @xmath9 , based on the galactic scale lengths given in table  1 . in  7",
    ", we will further investigate the plausibility of these numbers using stability arguments applied to the observed pn kinematics .",
    "we will also consider whether the use of a single value of @xmath9 is appropriate , or whether `` flaring '' must be considered in the extreme outer disks of galaxies .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath69 ) of a planetary nebula rotating in the disk of a galaxy is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the galactic systemic velocity , @xmath72 the disk inclination , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are the pn s component velocities in the radial ( @xmath76 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath77 ) , and vertical ( @xmath4 ) directions .",
    "note that even though our galaxies are nearly face - on , the effect of rotation is still considerable .",
    "this is easily seen in the left panels of figure  [ onbands ] , which display our measured pn velocities superimposed on an [ ]  @xmath78  image of each galaxy .",

    "the location of the maximum of each sinusoid indicates the position angle of the principal axis , while the amplitude of the curve places a limit on @xmath82 .",
    "this rotation must be removed before @xmath1 can be isolated .",
    "fortunately , the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) collaboration has recently used the very large array ( vla ) to create very high resolution velocity maps of four of our five spirals .",
    "moreover , @xcite have made a similar hi map for ic  342 , though with lower resolution .      to remove galactic rotation from our pn velocities , we first needed to define each disk s three dimensional geometry , and deproject the coordinates from the plane of the sky to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we started with literature values for each galaxy s position angle , inclination , and rotation curve , and then iteratively refined the parameters to fit the vla hi velocity maps . in some cases , this meant changing the quoted position angle of the major axis by a few degrees ; at other times , the inclination or rotation amplitude required modification .",

    "two different position angles were needed , one for the inner disk ( pa = @xmath96 ) , and one for the system s outer ring ( pa = @xmath97 ) . finally , to model the known isophotal twists of m83 , we started with the warped disk model of @xcite , which extends well beyond our survey area , and then adjusted the parameters to fit the higher resolution things data .",
    "the axes in the middle panels of figure  [ onbands ] illustrate our final values for the galactic position angles .",
    "we do note that just because our hi residuals exhibit no systematic trend with azimuth or radius , that does not mean that a map of the stellar velocity would be just as well - behaved .",
    "however , it is likely that the two are linked .",
    "* and references therein ) have found that disks which contain warps in hi often have stellar warps as well . moreover , in at least one case ( ngc  5907 ) , both warps have similar orientations @xcite .",
    "thus , our procedure of modeling the disk orientation using hi data should be valid .",
    "once the geometry of the disk was set , we subtracted off the hi rotation from the observed pn velocities .",
    "this generated the velocity residuals shown in figure  [ vres0phi ] .",
    "as the figure illustrates , the hi rotation curves do not remove all trace of systematic behavior from the velocities .",
    "in particular , the pn velocities of m83 and m94 now show a low - amplitude convex bowing with respect to @xmath98 azimuth .",
    "this is the signature of asymmetric drift , i.e. ,  the lag between the circular velocity , as measured by the gas , and the average azimuthal velocity of the stars . by using the hi data to define rotation , we oversubtracted the stars mean azimuthal motion .",
    "to estimate the amplitude of this effect , we can use the velocities of the pne themselves . because galactic disks are cold systems , the @xmath99 term of equation  ( [ vlos_eq ] ) clearly dominates .",
    "thus , to a first approximation , @xmath100 obviously , at @xmath101 and @xmath102 the solution to this equation is undefined , but if we exclude pne within @xmath103 of the minor axis and bin by radius , we can derive mean values of @xmath74 over the entire disk of the galaxy . these values can then be compared to the observed motion of the gas .",
    "this analysis confirms the results of figure  [ vres0phi ] : that asymmetric drift is negligible in ic  342 and m101 , @xmath215  km  s@xmath11  in m74 , between 20 and 40 km  s@xmath11  in m83 , and between 40 and 50 km  s@xmath11  in m94 .",
    "are these velocities reasonable ?",
    "it is important to note that asymmetric drift is extremely difficult to measure , so very few estimates exist in the literature . in the solar neighborhood , where the rotational velocity is @xmath104  km  s@xmath11 , the asymmetric drift is @xmath105  km  s@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this is roughly twice the value found by @xcite from radial velocity measurements of pne in the small , late - type spiral m33 ( @xmath106  km  s@xmath11 ) . for the large sb spiral m31 ( @xmath107  km  s@xmath11 ) ,",
    "pn measurements yield values of @xmath108 between 40 to 50  km  s@xmath11  @xcite , and in the barred lenticular ngc  1023 ( @xmath104  km  s@xmath11 ) , @xmath109  km  s@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "these estimates suggest that asymmetric drift is usually 10 - 20% of the rotation velocity in late - type galaxies and slightly larger in earlier systems .",
    "both correlations make sense : in the milky way , asymmetric drift is correlated with stellar population , since older stars have had more time to scatter @xcite , and the amount ( and amplitude ) of this scatter depends on the speed of rotation .",

    "we have used a single drift value for each galaxy ; this is consistent with the pn data of m31 , m33 , and ngc  1023 , which suggest that the asymmetric drift within a galaxy is roughly constant with radius .",
    "we also list the `` best fit value '' for each object , i.e. ,  the one that minimizes our residual line - of - sight pn velocity dispersions while still being in the range between 0.1 and @xmath112 ( see next section ) . as figure",
    "[ vres0phi ] and table  [ tabasd ] indicate , our galaxies exhibit a range of drift velocities .",
    "m83 , which is a strongly barred galaxy and the fastest rotator in our sample , has the largest value of @xmath108 . in m94 , which is an early - type system ( hubble type sab ) , @xmath108 is also rather large , @xmath240  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , ic  342 and m101 both have rather low values for the asymmetric drift .",
    "this suggests that their disks are relatively young , an idea supported by the fact that these two galaxies are the latest systems in our sample ( hubble types scd ) .",
    "finally , the asymmetric drift for m74 is slightly higher than expected ; however , due to the galaxy s extremely low inclination ( @xmath113 ) , this number is very uncertain .",
    "we will revisit our estimates of @xmath108 in  9 , when we have measurements for the disks radial and perpendicular velocity dispersions .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ onbands ] display our pn line - of - sight velocities with the hi gas rotation and our best - fit asymmetric drift values removed .",
    "the data show no trend with @xmath77 , indicating that the adopted drift values are reasonable .",
    "we note that the results that follow depend very little on the exact values of @xmath108 : because our galaxies all have low - inclinations , 10 to 20  km  s@xmath11   changes in the asymmetric drift have almost no effect on the final values for the @xmath4 component of the velocity dispersion .",
    "after the removal of rotation , our next step was to exclude those objects not part of the general disk population .",
    "since all five of our program galaxies are disk - dominated systems , the vast majority of the pne should be rotating close to the galactic plane .",
    "however , a few halo objects may be present , and these objects can greatly distort our measurement of the disk velocity dispersion .",
    "for example , a halo pn will typically orbit at a velocity close to @xmath114 , but with some random orientation in the galaxy . for a nominal rotation speed of @xmath2200  km  s@xmath11",
    ", this implies a velocity of @xmath2100  km  s@xmath11  with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "this is much larger than the expected value for velocity dispersion of disk stars .",
    "still , identifying halo pne can be difficult .",
    "depending on the orientation of its orbit , a halo pn can have a line - of - sight velocity that mimics that of the disk .",
    "more importantly , if the disks of our program galaxies are anything like that of the milky way , we can expect a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath240  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "thus a typical halo planetary may have a velocity that is only @xmath22.5  @xmath115 away from the mean of the disk population .",
    "nevertheless , we can identify obvious halo candidates via a sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "for each pn , we identified its 15 closest neighbors ( in radial distance ) and , using those objects , we estimated the local disk velocity dispersion .",
    "any pn more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean ( where @xmath115 is defined from the disk dispersion and pn velocity uncertainty added in quadrature ) , was flagged as a possible halo contaminant and eliminated from the analysis .",
    "formally , this means that out of our entire sample of @xmath2550  pne , we may be improperly excluding as many as @xmath211  disk objects . however , given the deleterious effect that halo pne may have on our results , we feel that @xmath116 is a reasonable threshold for pn exclusion .",
    "the top panels of figures  [ icrsds3]-[m101rsds3 ] show the velocity residuals of all our pne and identify those objects with discrepant velocities .",
    "even with our harsh @xmath116 condition , very few pne are excluded from the analysis . in m74 ,",
    "pn  127 is an obvious ( @xmath26@xmath117 ) outlier and pne  66 , 96 , and 146 also appear to be contaminating halo objects . in ic  342 ,",
    "pne  42 , 98 , and 111 are likely halo interlopers , while in m83 pne  8 , 43 , 48 , 50 , 102 and 175 have the kinematics of the spheroidal component . despite the fact that m94 is an sab galaxy , only three of its pne ( 26 , 63 , and 102 ) are questionable :",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the galaxy s bulge is small , and that our pn identifications were largely confined to the galaxy s outer regions where the disk dominates .",
    "finally , none of the pne in m101 s kinematic sample have discrepant velocities : although pn  51 is a possible halo object , we had already excluded it from the analysis due to its large measurement error .",
    "with rotation removed and the halo pne eliminated from the analysis , we could examine the kinematics of the galactic disks .",
    "we started by assigning an equal number of pne per radial bin ( 16 per bin in ic  342 , m74 , and m83 , 18 per bin in m94 , and 15 per bin in m101 ) , and computing the line - of - sight velocity dispersion within each bin . according to equation  ( [ isothermal ] ) , this function should be a declining exponential with a scale length twice that of the light _ if _ the following conditions hold true :    the uncertainties in our velocity measurements are small compared to @xmath1 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity residuals are dominated by the motions of stars in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the scale height , @xmath9 , is constant over the region of the survey .",
    "the disk mass - to - light ratio , @xmath0 , is constant over the region of the survey .",
    "the scale length , @xmath3 , is constant over the region of the survey .",
    "the middle panels of figures  [ icrsds3]-[m101rsds3 ] compare our dispersions to such an exponential .",
    "it is immediately obvious that in ic  342 and over the inner @xmath23 scale lengths of m74 and m94 , the measured velocity dispersion falls off exactly as expected for a constant @xmath0 disk .",
    "this result is consistent with that found from integrated - light absorption line spectroscopy , although the latter technique has never probed radii larger than @xmath22  scale lengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the outer bins of m94 , the velocity dispersion does not fall off .",
    "instead it asymptotes out at @xmath230  km  s@xmath11 , a value that is an order of magnitude greater than the @xmath23  km  s@xmath11  median error of the data .",
    "this behavior is also present in the outer regions of m83 : if one ignores the low dispersions of the second and third bins ( which are affected by the galaxy s outer lindblad resonance ) , then the dispersion profile is consistent with a declining exponential in the inner regions , and a constant value at large radii . only m101 does not follow the pattern : its line - of - sight velocity dispersion is almost flat over @xmath24  optical scale lengths .    before discussing this behavior further ,",
    "we consider four possible systematic errors which could be associated with our measurements .",
    "measurement errors provide a lower limit to our observed disk velocity dispersion .",
    "if these errors were large , it could produce a plateau in the observed dispersion curve .",
    "however , as demonstrated in paper  ii , the uncertainties quoted for our pn velocities are accurate , and significantly smaller than the measured disk dispersion ( see the dotted lines in figures  [ icrsds3]-[m101rsds3 ] ) . alternately ,",
    "if some intrinsic property of the pne themselves limited the precision of our measurements , we would again see a plateau in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if the measured radial velocity of an ( asymmetrical ) pn depended on its orientation , then we would expect the dispersion profile to have an artificial floor .",
    "of course , any such floor would need to be less than the @xmath212  km  s@xmath11  value recorded in the outer disk of m74 .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to conceive of how a forbidden line with a @xmath220  km  s@xmath11  symmetric velocity width could yield a @xmath212  km  s@xmath11  velocity error which depends on viewing angle . in any case , since this floor should be the same in every galaxy , it can not explain dispersions of 20 to 30  km  s@xmath11  seen in m83 , m94 , and m101 .",
    "one other possible error comes from the small ( @xmath25  km  s@xmath11 ) uncertainties associated with the hi measurements used to remove rotation , and with our estimated values for asymmetric drift .",
    "such an error is suppressed by @xmath79 , but it can still affect our values for @xmath38 . to investigate this problem , we performed a series of experiments , in which the asymmetric drift was allowed to vary between 0 and 50  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "these simulations showed that our line - of - sight dispersion measurements are insensitive to errors in the global rotation , changing by only a couple of km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this type of error can not be responsible for the dispersion profiles observed in the figures .",
    "papers  i and ii describe the criteria used to identify the planetary nebulae used in this analysis .",
    "the data were well scrutinized , and any bias in the selection process was made on the side of eliminating valid pne rather than including possible contaminants .",
    "nevertheless , it is still conceivable that compact , high - excitation hii regions have slipped into the kinematic sample .",
    "the most serious case is for m101 , where we have included six objects whose spectra may contain some contamination from a kinematically distinct source , and six other objects with questionably bright h@xmath14 lines .",
    "however , even without these objects , m101 s line - of - sight velocity profile is flat with radius .",
    "in addition , during our m74 and m83 observations , we obtained spectra of a significant number of suspected hii regions . to examine the effect these objects can have on our results",
    ", we repeated the analysis of these two spirals , while including 21 and 63 contaminating sources , respectively .",
    "as expected , the addition of a younger population decreases the observed dispersion . in m74 ,",
    "the new , contaminated @xmath38 was smaller , but within the uncertainties , still consistent with the results from the uncontaminated data .",
    "in m83 where we added three times the number of contaminants , the dispersion again decreased , especially in the inner two bins and the outermost bin , where most of the interlopers are located .",
    "nevertheless , the general shape of the dispersion profile remained the same .",
    "the results confirm that the addition of a young population  i component can only decrease the dispersion ; it can not explain the relatively high values of @xmath38 in the outer disks of our galaxies .",
    "since spiral galaxies are known to have dust at low galactic latitudes , one might wonder if internal extinction could affect the results of our survey . practically speaking , a thick layer of dust",
    "would preferentially dim those pne near the galactic plane and on the far side of the galaxy , while leaving objects with large @xmath4 distances on the near side unaffected . in the case of an isothermal disk ,",
    "@xmath1 is independent of @xmath4 , so dust would have no effect on our results .",
    "however , for intermediate and exponential disks , the observed velocity dispersion increases with height above the plane @xcite .",
    "consequently , a thick layer of dust could theoretically drive dispersion measurements towards higher values .",
    "however , such a model is unlikely , as it is inconsistent with the number of pne we observe ( since the dust would extinguish large numbers of pne below our detection limit ) , and the distribution of pn [ ] /h@xmath14 line ratios ( see papers  i and ii ) .",
    "moreover , because the radial scale length of dust is usually larger than that for the stars @xcite , it is the dispersion measurements in the inner disk that would be most effected .",
    "@xcite have discussed the situation in more detail and found that dust can not explain the flat velocity dispersions at large galactic radii .",
    "warps are known to exist in the outer regions of spiral galaxies and an undetected change in inclination could propagate into incorrect values of @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , one of the main reasons we adjusted the geometric parameters when fitting the vla hi velocity maps was to remove warping as a cause for concern . as indicated in  4.1 and the central panels of figure  [ onbands ] , only m83 and",
    "m94 required anything other than a simple , flat disk . however , since these are the best examples of flat dispersion profiles , it is important to re - examine this possibility .",
    "m94 s fit required two components , one for the galaxy s interior regions ( @xmath118  kpc ) , and one for the outer disk , so it is unlikely that our warping model could be an issue in this system . the model for m83 , however , was based on previous hi analyses by @xcite and @xcite , and was much more complicated . yet despite this complexity , warping only slightly alters the dispersion measurements and the overall effect on @xmath119 is minimal . specifically , if we assume a simple , flat disk , and re - run the analysis of m83 s pne , the results are essentially the same .",
    "even a moderate amount of warping can not be responsible for the velocity dispersions seen in the figures .",
    "the velocity dispersions shown in the middle panels of figures  [ m74rsds3 ] through [ m101rsds3 ] suggest that the outer disks of galaxies may not be simple constant scale height , constant @xmath0 exponentials . however , to confirm this result , we would like to extract @xmath1 from the line - of - sight measurements . to do this , we began by breaking down the observed velocity dispersion into its three orthogonal components : the radial ( @xmath39 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath40 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath1 ) velocity dispersions , i.e.,@xmath120 ( note that the ( known ) observational uncertainty of each velocity is explicitly included via the @xmath121 term . ) we then removed @xmath40 from the equation by taking advantage of the fact that the motion of stars in a cold disk can be approximated by the superposition of a circular orbit with movement in a small ellipse with frequency @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the circular velocity inferred from the motions of the hi gas @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal and radial velocity dispersions are therefore related by @xmath124 the line - of - sight dispersion can then be written as a function of two variables : @xmath39 , which modulates with position angle in the galaxy , and @xmath1 , which does not .",
    "we can therefore determine the likelihood that a particular combination of these two variables will generate an observed set of pn velocities .",
    "figures  [ iccon]-[m83con ] display the relative probabilities of such an analysis . for the calculation , we have constrained the ratio of the two dispersions to lie in the range @xmath125 , where the upper limit comes from the physics of disk scattering , since both theory @xcite and observations @xcite require @xmath39 to dominate .",
    "the lower limit is a consequence of the buckling or `` fire hose '' instability , which can occur in a cold disk @xcite .",
    "these limits are responsible for the cone - like shapes of the diagrams .",
    "as the figures show , the shapes of the likelihood probabilities vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "this reflects differences in galactic inclination . in m74 , which is extremely close to face - on ( @xmath126 )",
    ", @xmath38 is almost entirely due to @xmath1 , and @xmath39 is essentially unconstrained .",
    "conversely , as the disks become more inclined , our sensitivity to @xmath39 grows at the expense of our measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "the bottom panels of figures  [ icrsds3]-[m101rsds3 ] marginalize these likelihoods over radial dispersion to find the most likely values of @xmath1 and their @xmath127 uncertainties . once again",
    ", the black curves indicate exponential laws with twice the scale length of the @xmath76-band light .",
    "as expected for low - inclination systems , the @xmath1 profiles track those of the line - of - sight dispersions extremely well .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath38 is roughly constant across the face of each galaxy , ranging from @xmath20.76 in ic  342 to @xmath20.86 in m74 . for ic  342 and m74 ,",
    "the disks are well - fit by a constant scale height , constant @xmath0 model .",
    "in contrast , the data for m83 and m101 do not follow the expected exponential : in these objects , either the scale length , scale height , or mass - to - light ratio is changing . finally , m94 appears to be a hybrid : while the inner @xmath24 scale lengths can be fit with a simple model , the outer regions demand an additional term .",
    "one additional constraint can be applied to the data . in order for our thin stellar disks to be stable against axisymmetric perturbations",
    ", they must satisfy the @xcite criterion @xmath128 if we combine this relation with equation  ( [ isothermal ] ) , we obtain a new constraint on the possible values of @xmath39 and @xmath1 @xmath129 where @xmath130 for intermediate disks , @xmath9 is the stellar scale height , and @xmath131 is the epicyclic frequency given by equation  ( [ kappa ] ) .",

    "unfortunately , it is also the galaxy with the poorest velocity sampling , with only 60 pn measurements , including 12 objects whose velocities may be compromised by nearby emission .",
    "nevertheless , since the system s inclination is only @xmath217@xmath80 , the probabilities produced by our analysis ( figure  [ m101con ] ) are relatively flat , and the corresponding values of @xmath1 are reasonably well - defined .",

    "alternatively , we can assume that @xmath9 is constant , and ascribe the flat velocity dispersion to a change in the galaxy s disk mass - to - light ratio .",
    "m101 has a central @xmath76-band surface brightness of @xmath176 @xcite , and almost no foreground extinction ( @xmath177 ; * ? ? ?",

    "these values are reasonable : the surface mass is consistent with that inferred from the hi rotation curve @xcite , and @xmath0 falls midway between that of the blue , late - type spiral ic  342 , and that for the earlier m74 system . however , when we adopt these numbers and use the observed @xmath76-band disk scale length of @xmath25  kpc , the velocity dispersion at @xmath217  kpc implies a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath181 .",
    "this is an extremely large value for an actively star - forming disk .",
    "again , we note that due to the limited number of planetary nebulae discovered in the @xcite survey , the velocity field of m101 is poorly sampled . with only four bins of 15  pne each ,",
    "there is not enough information to model the galaxy with both a variable @xmath9 and changing @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , with such a limited number of objects , our analysis is susceptible to the effects of disk substructure .",
    "for example , if some of the pne targeted in our survey actually belong to the remnants of a disrupted companion galaxy ( like the milky way s sagittarius dwarf ) , then our derived disk mass measurements would be in error .",

    "the result is the high - quality dispersion profile seen in figure  [ m94rsds3 ] , which clearly shows an exponential decline over the galaxy s inner regions , followed by a flattening which begins at @xmath24  disk scale lengths .    unlike the galaxies of the previous sections",
    ", m94 does not have a simple surface brightness profile : while the galaxy s inner disk follows an exponential law , its outer regions are dominated by the luminosity of a faint stellar ring @xcite .",
    "have recently analyzed m94 s profile using 3.6  @xmath184 m surface brightness measurements from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings ; * ? ? ?",
    "their data show that the galaxy s disk is best modeled by an inner , rapidly falling exponential ( scale length @xmath185  kpc ) , which is abruptly replaced at @xmath186  kpc by an almost constant surface - brightness ( scale length @xmath187  kpc ) envelope .",
    "the surface photometry of @xcite confirms this result : in the @xmath76-band , m94 has a rapidly declining inner disk ( @xmath185  kpc ) , a uniform brightness outer ring ( @xmath188  kpc between 4.6 and 7.0  kpc ) , and a slowly declining outer disk ( @xmath189  kpc ) .",
    "thus , in the classification scheme of @xcite , m94 is a type",
    "iii `` antitruncated '' spiral , whose disk surface brightness declines with one slope in its inner regions , and a different , shallower slope at larger radii .",
    "roughly 30% of all spirals , and @xmath250% of all early - type spirals fall into this category @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our pn number counts support the classification of m94 as a type  iii object , as there are far too many planetary nebulae at large radii to be explained by a single exponential law .    while the cause of the break in type  iii disk galaxies is unclear , one possibility is that it is due to the increased importance of the thick disk at large radii @xcite .",
    "our kinematic study is consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "since early - type spirals typically have @xmath190 @xcite , m94 s disk scale height should be relatively large , @xmath191  pc .",
    "indeed , as figure  [ m94con ] illustrates , a 300  pc scale height satisfies the @xcite stability criterion throughout the inner regions of the galaxy , while values much smaller than @xmath2200  pc do not .",
    "however , outside @xmath24  kpc , no thin - disk value of @xmath9 is stable ; at these radii , significantly larger scale heights , even as high as 900  pc , are needed . in m94 s outer regions ,",
    "the light we see must be coming from a thick disk .",
    "based on these data , we decided to model the galaxy using two separate kinematic populations . within 3.8  kpc",
    ", we assume that most of the pne are part of the galaxy s thin disk with @xmath191  pc ; outside of 5  kpc , we allow the thick disk to dominate , and set the scale height to 3  times that of the thin disk , i.e. ,  900  pc .",
    "such a ratio agrees with observations of the milky way @xcite and ngc  891 @xcite , and is consistent with the range of values found by @xcite for a sample of 34 edge - on galaxies . in between these two extremes , we define a transition zone , where the effective scale height increases linearly with radius .",
    "the gray curve in the lower panel of figure  [ m94rsds3 ] illustrates our thin disk - thick disk model , with each component having a fixed mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this curve is an excellent fit to the data .",
    "the central disk velocity dispersion implied by our fit is @xmath144  km  s@xmath11 ; when combined with m94 s central @xmath76-band disk surface brightness ( @xmath192 ; * ? ? ? * ) and",
    "foreground extinction ( @xmath183 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this yields a thin - disk mass - to - light ratio of @xmath193 .",
    "our thick - disk mass - to - light ratio based on this same @xmath76-band surface photometry and the outer three bins of figure  [ m94rsds3 ] is @xmath194 .",
    "these values are reasonable , given the galaxy s early hubble type .",
    "the barred spiral m83 is the galaxy for which we have the widest spatial coverage ( @xmath225  kpc ) and the largest set of high - precision pn velocities ( 162 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is also the object with the most puzzling dispersion profile . as figure  [ m83rsds3 ] illustrates , except for its innermost bin , m83",
    "s @xmath1 values remain virtually unchanged from @xmath26 to @xmath220  kpc , a region which spans @xmath24  disk scale lengths .",
    "one reason for this behavior may be the presence of the system s strong bar , as the structure s outer lindblad resonance is located between our second and third velocity bins ( at @xmath195 or @xmath26.83  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "since all the stellar velocities in the area are affected , it is quite possible that our derived value for the region s",
    "@xmath1 is an underestimate .",
    "these points should therefore be excluded from the analysis .",
    "the rest of m83 s dispersion profile is not as easy to interpret . unlike m94",
    ", m83 shows no evidence for a type  iii anti - truncated disk or a flattened surface - brightness profile at large radii .",
    "indeed , according to de jong ( 2008 , private communication ) , the galaxy s @xmath196-band surface brightness profile declines with a single exponential scale length of 80@xmath197 ( 1.88  kpc ) over the entire region of our survey .",
    "thus , the relatively large velocity dispersion in the outer disk can not be explained by an excess of stellar mass in the region .",
    "another puzzle comes from the galaxy s rather small radial scale length .",
    "although m83 is the fastest rotator in our sample ( with a @xmath114 of 255 km",
    "s@xmath11 ) , it also has the second smallest value of @xmath3 : 2.45  kpc in @xmath76 and 1.88  kpc in @xmath196 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de jong 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "if the scale length to scale height ratio is similar to that of other galaxies , i.e. ,  @xmath198 @xcite , then this implies a value for @xmath9 near @xmath2200  pc .",
    "however , as figure  [ m83con ] demonstrates , scale heights as small as this yield solutions for @xmath1 that are unstable to axisymmetric perturbations @xcite . as a result ,",
    "any attempt to fit the data by varying @xmath9 while keeping @xmath3 constant leads to either an unphysically large scale height , an exceptionally low value of @xmath65 , or a large central velocity dispersion that is completely inconsistent with the galaxy s rotation curve .    given these difficulties , we chose to model m83 with a two component , thin disk - thick disk model .",
    "for the galaxy s thin disk , we adopted a scale length of 4.0  kpc , a central velocity dispersion of @xmath199  km  s@xmath11 , and a scale height of 400  pc ; for the systems thick disk , we assumed @xmath200  kpc , @xmath201  km  s@xmath11 , and @xmath202  pc .",
    "as the curve in the lower panel of figure  [ m83rsds3 ] indicates , this type of model , although arbitrary , does do a good job of reproducing the observed behavior of @xmath1 .    if we adopt this model , and use a central @xmath76-band disk surface brightness of @xmath203 @xcite and a foreground galactic extinction of @xmath204 @xcite , then m83 s central disk mass - to - light ratio becomes @xmath205 , where the 50% uncertainty is a conservative estimate . in keeping with the galaxy s hubble type",
    ", this value is intermediate between the lower values of ic  342 and m101 and the high values for m74 and m94 . of course , because the galaxy s surface brightness declines with radius while its @xmath4 velocity dispersion does not , the inferred value for @xmath0 increases dramatically in the galaxy s outer regions .",

    "although these numbers have a degree of systematic uncertainty due to our lack of knowledge about the disks vertical structure , they are nonetheless in the range expected for normal , star - forming stellar populations .",
    "our measurements of the disk velocity ellipsoids are quite uncertain .",
    "since the galaxies in our sample were selected on the basis of their low inclination , our ability to measure @xmath39 , the disk velocity dispersion in the radial direction , is very limited .",
    "consequently , as figure  [ shapes ] illustrates , a marginalization over the likelihoods of figures  [ iccon]-[m83con ] places few constraints on @xmath208 , especially in our two most face - on galaxies , m74 and m101 .",
    "the trend toward higher @xmath208 in the three more inclined systems is likely a numerical artifact caused by switching from @xmath39-@xmath1 space to ( @xmath208)-@xmath1 space for this analysis .",
    "finally , the data in figure  [ shapes ] can be used to confirm our estimates of each galaxy s asymmetric drift .",
    "the full expression for the drift velocity in a stellar disk is @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the stellar density @xcite .",
    "however , if the disk is roughly isothermal with constant @xmath9 , then the epicyclic approximation gives @xmath211 finally , figure  [ shapes ] suggests that the shape of a disk s velocity ellipsoid does not change much with radius . in this case",
    ", the application of equation  ( [ isothermal ] ) creates a very simple expression for asymmetric drift @xmath212 where we have substituted in @xmath3 by assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio in the stellar disk .",
    "this equation yields roughly constant asymmetric drift velocities throughout the three disks where our assumptions appear valid . in the inner regions of our earliest spiral",
    ", m94 , equation  ( [ jeans2 ] ) implies an asymmetric drift velocity of @xmath109  km  s@xmath11 , exactly the value assumed in  4.2 .",
    "conversely , in the two latest galaxies in our sample , our derived values for the drift velocity , @xmath213  km  s@xmath11  ( for ic  342 ) and @xmath28  km  s@xmath11  ( for m101 ) are slightly lower than the values assumed above ( 20 and 25  km  s@xmath11 , respectively ) . of course , given the uncertainties associated with our estimates of @xmath39 , the numbers are still consistent .",
    "finally , the face - on nature of m74 and disturbed rotation curve of m83 ( due to its bar ) , preclude statements about the asymmetric drifts in these galaxies .",
    "however , it does appear that our assumption of asymmetric drift being between 10% and 20% of the rotation speed is valid .",
    "most analyses of the rotation curves of spirals galaxies make use of the maximal - disk hypothesis , wherein the rotation curve near the center of the galaxy is assumed to be defined entirely by the potential of a thin disk .",
    "our measurements of @xmath1 allow us to test this assumption and probe the distribution of the systems dark matter halos .",
    "the circular velocity produced by an exponential disk with radial scale length , @xmath3 , and central surface mass , @xmath214 , is given by @xmath215 \\label{disk_vc0}\\ ] ] where @xmath216 and @xmath217 and @xmath218 are modified bessel functions @xcite . when combined with equation  ( [ isothermal ] ) , this implies a relation between the disk s rotation speed , @xmath4-velocity dispersion , and scale length to scale height ratio , i.e.,@xmath219 , \\label{disk_vc1}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 for a disk with a vertical distribution intermediate between exponential and isothermal .",
    "since the rotational velocities of our disks are well measured @xcite , and the behavior of @xmath65 with hubble type and rotation speed is known from the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our measurements of @xmath220 place an immediate constraint on the importance of dark matter near the centers of galaxies .",
    "the result of this analysis is illustrated in figure  [ rotcurves ] and summarized in column 7 of table  [ tabhz ] . in brief",
    ", the five disks examined in this survey display a range of properties , depending on the hubble type of the system .",
    "the disks of our latest galaxies , ic  342 and m101 , are clearly sub - maximal , requiring scale - length to scale - height ratios @xmath221 to attain the maximal condition .",
    "unless these disks are extremely thin ( 100  pc for ic  342 and 60  pc for m101 ) , their dark matter halos must be contributing significantly to the potential of their inner regions . in the sc galaxies m74 and m83 , the situation is not as clear . for m74 s disk to be maximal , @xmath222 ( i.e. ,  @xmath223  pc ) .",
    "although this seems significantly larger than the value of @xmath28 expected for an sc galaxy @xcite , the two values can be forced into marginal agreement if one assumes that the vertical structure of the disk is exponential , rather than intermediate or isothermal .",
    "similarly , m83 has a requisite scale ratio near the edge of the range expected for sbc galaxies , @xmath64 .",
    "only the sab galaxy m94 , with its high surface - brightness bulge has a disk that can be considered maximal : if we model the galaxy s inner regions with an @xmath191  pc disk and a @xmath224 @xcite bulge ( @xmath225  kpc ) , then the rotation curve of the central @xmath21.5  kpc is entirely explained by baryons .",
    "we note that with this simple model , the mass - to - light ratio of m94 s inner disk is actually greater than that of its bulge ; however , if the disk s vertical structure is modeled as isothermal , rather than intermediate , or if the disk s scale height is smaller than @xmath2300  pc , then the mass - to - light ratios come into much better agreement .    since four of our galactic disks are sub - maximal ,",
    "it is a simple matter to remove the contribution of their rotation curves and examine the potential of the remaining dark matter component .",
    "when describing halo distributions , two models are generally considered : one following the predictions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) and one obeying a pseudo - isothermal ( iso ) law @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve for the former is given by @xmath226 } } , \\label{nfw}\\ ] ] where @xmath227 , @xmath228 is the radius at which the density contrast over the background exceeds 200 , @xmath229 is the circular velocity at @xmath228 , and @xmath230 is a concentration parameter , which physically should always be greater than 1 .",
    "in contrast , the rotation curve for the pseudo - isothermal law is @xmath231 } , \\label{iso}\\ ] ] where @xmath232 is the central density of the halo and @xmath233 is the core radius .",
    "figure  [ rotcurves ] fits both these profiles to our residual rotation curves . as the figure illustrates , the isothermal model fits the data extremely well with mean variances of 0.24 , 0.17 , 0.04 , and 4.52  km@xmath234  s@xmath165 for ic  342 , m74 , m101 and m83 , respectively . ( in m83 , the lack of pn identifications in the central @xmath21  disk scale length limits the accuracy of our extrapolation . )",
    "in contrast , the nfw fits are all very poor , with large mean variances ( 39.2 , 37.2 , 8.51 , and 174.8  km@xmath234  s@xmath165 for these same four galaxies ) , unphysical concentration indices ( @xmath235 ) and density distributions that overpredict the inner rotation curve . as in the case of low - surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the inner rotation curves of normal spirals are not well represented by nfw profiles .",
    "in contrast to the galaxies inner regions , the outer disks of spirals are not constant @xmath0 , constant @xmath9 systems . as the data of m83 , m94 , and perhaps m74 show , in these distant regions , it is the product of surface mass times scale height that appears constant .",
    "specifically , in m94 , the ratio of @xmath236 has one value in the galaxy s inner regions , and another larger value in the outer disk , and in m83 , the ratio blows up at large radii .",
    "( the same effect can be seen in the outer regions of m33 @xcite , though the larger inclination of this galaxy creates an ambiguity in the interpretation . ) at radii greater than @xmath23  disk scale lengths , the disks of spiral galaxies are either flaring , increasing their mass - to - light ratio , or changing their luminosity profile from that of a single scale - length exponential .    to some extent , all three of these phenomena must be happening .",
    "since many galaxies have large hi envelopes , an increase in the disk mass - to - optical light ratio at large radii is not unexpected .",
    "however , measurements from the things survey @xcite demonstrate that this effect is minor : even in the outer regions of m83 and m94 , hi contributes no more than @xmath210% of the kinematically - estimated disk mass",
    ". similarly , many spirals do not have simple exponential disks in their outer regions .",
    "in m94 , a shallowing of the surface brightness profile was recorded by @xcite and sings @xcite , and this excess luminosity goes a long way towards explaining the system s mass - to - light ratio .",
    "unfortunately , not all spirals have such breaks , and the disk of m83 appears to follow the same exponential over the entire range of our survey . finally , stability arguments demand that some flaring occurs in the outer parts of spirals . in all of our galaxies ( except ic  342",
    ", whose data only extends to @xmath22  disk scale lengths ) , @xmath9 likely increases past @xmath23 disk scale lengths , in order to satisfy the @xcite criterion against axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "is there any direct evidence for flaring in the outer disks of spirals ?",
    "studies of edge - on galaxies have generally found that galactic scale heights are roughly constant with radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even when radial gradients have been found , they have generally been small , and linked to the presence of the thick disks of early - type systems @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have mostly been confined to the systems bright inner regions . in ngc  891 , which has extremely deep surface photometry derived from individual star counts , a thick , highly - flattened",
    ", low surface brightness structure does extend well beyond the limits of the galaxy s thin disk @xcite .",
    "mechanisms do exist which can cause the scale height of stars to increase rapidly at large radii .",
    "@xcite have shown that self - gravitating disks acting under the influence of hi and h@xmath237 gas and a dark matter halo can develop moderately large scale height gradients in their outer regions ( @xmath238  disk scale lengths ) .",
    "alternatively , flared - disks and higher than expected values of @xmath1 can be caused by interactions with halo substructures .",
    "in fact , model  f by @xcite , which simulates the heating of the milky way s disk by a population of @xmath2300 moderately massive ( @xmath210@xmath239 ) dark matter subhalos , produces a velocity dispersion profile that is an excellent match to that seen in m83 and m94 @xcite .",
    "recent simulations by s. kazantzidis ( 2009 , private communications ) confirm this result , as they reproduce the full @xmath1 profiles of the two galaxies extremely well .",
    "thus , the flaring inferred by our kinematic data is certainly plausible .",
    "an analysis of 550 precise pn velocities has yielded kinematic mass estimates throughout the disks of five low - inclination spiral galaxies . in the inner regions of ic  342 , m74 , and m94",
    ", we find that the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the galactic disk exponentially decays with a scale length twice that of the optical light .",
    "while our observations of the remaining two galaxies yield ambiguous results ( due to a lindbland resonance in m83 and a poorly sampled velocity field in m101 ) , the data are consistent with expectations from a constant scale height , constant mass - to - light ratio disk . in the later - type ( scd )",
    "systems , these disks are clearly sub - maximal , with surface mass densities less than a quarter that needed to reproduce the central rotation curves . in",
    "earlier ( sc ) galaxies , this discrepancy is smaller , but still present ; only the very - early sab system m94 has evidence for a maximal disk .",
    "when we subtract off the disk contribution from the hi rotation curve , we infer the potential of the galaxies invisible dark halos in all our galaxies except m94 .",
    "( the uncertainties in the contribution of m94 s bright bulge preclude such an analysis in this earliest galaxy in our sample . ) in all four cases , these halos are best fit with a simple pseudo - isothermal model ; nfw profiles are poor fits to the data , as they always overpredict the residual rotation curve .",
    "as in the analysis of low surface - brightness and dwarf galaxies , we find no evidence for central dark matter cusps in our systems .",
    "interestingly , once outside of @xmath23  disk scale lengths , the @xmath4-direction velocity dispersion of galactic disks no longer declines , but instead stays constant with radius .",
    "this behavior , coupled with stability arguments , suggests that the disks of spiral galaxies flare substantially at extremely large radii , and may have strongly increasing mass - to - light ratios . whether this flaring is related to the increased importance of the thick disk , or heating of the thin disk by halo substructure ,",
    "is unclear at the present time . to further investigate this phenomenon ,",
    "deep surface photometry of the extreme outer disks of edge - on galaxies is needed .",
    "our kinematic mass estimates for galactic disks are consistent with expectations .",
    "the galaxies with the latest hubble types ( ic  342 , m101 ) have the smallest mass - to - light ratios , while earlier systems ( m74 and m94 ) have values of @xmath0 greater than one .",
    "unfortunately , at this time , no deep , multi - band optical and ir surface photometry exists for any of our galaxies .",
    "once these data are acquired , we will be able to compare our kinematic values for @xmath0 to stellar mass - to - light ratio estimates from population synthesis models .",
    "such a confrontation will not only produce a better constraint on galactic populations , but also will improve our knowledge of the phase - space distribution of galactic disks .",
