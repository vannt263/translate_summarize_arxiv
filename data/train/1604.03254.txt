    "under the currently popular @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite , the large - scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies emerges when the initial density fluctuations grow with time through gravitational attraction between galaxies . the @xmath0cdm cosmological model has been successful in reproducing the lss at @xmath6 , showing the promise of the @xmath0cdm cosmology to explain our universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the growth of lsss has not been thoroughly tested yet with observational data at @xmath7 .",
    "lsss stretch from several tens of mpc to a few hundred mpc , but there is a lack of data sets that are deep and wide enough to cover such structures at high redshifts . so far , high - redshift lss studies have been limited mostly to galaxy - cluster - scale structures ( @xmath812 mpc ) , with mixed results .",
    "some results show agreements with the @xmath0cdm cosmology models @xcite , but others suggest too many massive clusters at @xmath9 @xcite .    with the advance of large and deep imaging surveys , it is now possible to extend the test of the cosmological formation of lsss to scales much larger than before .",
    "specific predictions have been made about superclusters at high redshift .",
    "a supercluster represents the most massive structure in the universe with sizes of up to @xmath5100200 mpc , containing filaments , multiple galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "several studies have pointed out that superclusters are useful objects to test cosmological models @xcite .",
    "so far , only a handful number of superclusters have been found at @xmath10",
    ". the cl 1604 supercluster at @xmath20.91 has 8 member clusters and groups that have velocity dispersions in the range of @xmath5280 to 820 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "another supercluster is identified at @xmath11 in the elais - n1 field , containing 5 clusters @xcite .",
    "a compact supercluster , rcs 2319 + 00 @xcite , stands as the most massive supercluster found at @xmath20.9 with the summed mass of members exceeding @xmath12 @xcite , and a separation between the member clusters is less than 3 mpc .",
    "finally , the lynx supercluster at @xmath13 contains two x - ray clusters and three groups confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .    in order to unveil lsss and other interesting high - redshift objects ,",
    "we have been conducting the infrared medium - deep survey ( ims ; i m , m. , et al .",

    "the ims is a deep ( @xmath14 ab mag ) and wide ( @xmath15 deg@xmath16 ) near - infrared ( nir ) imaging survey that combines deep @xmath17-band imaging data with other optical / nir survey data , making it possible to find lsss at @xmath10 . here , we report the discovery of a new , massive supercluster at @xmath18 in the ssa22 area as the first result , and discuss if such an lss is compatible with cosmological simulation predictions .",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters for the flat universe with @xmath190.27 , @xmath20=71 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , and @xmath210.8 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system . in addition , all distance scales are physical scales based on the angular diameter distance , unless otherwise noted .",
    "our work is based on wide and deep data sets for the ssa22 field ( @xmath2222@xmath2317@xmath2400@xmath25 and @xmath26002000 ) from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",

    "the 80% point - source detection limits are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the cfhtls , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 for ukidss dxs and ims @xcite .",
    "sources were detected using sextractor @xcite in dual mode , and the unconvolved @xmath17-band images were used for the detection and to measure the @xmath17-band total magnitude . in addition , 2diameter apertures were applied to psf matched images to derive aperture magnitudes for the color measurement . for this work",

    "photometric redshifts ( @xmath38 ) were derived using the _ le phare _ software @xcite after training the data using spectroscopic redshifts with flags of 3 , 4 , 23 , and 24 from the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ; * ? ? ?",

    "the threshold corresponds to approximately 4@xmath54 above the mean density , if we fit the @xmath49 distribution with a gaussian function in linear scale at @xmath55 .",
    "we group galaxies whose cells have @xmath56 and are adjacent to each other as a possible overdense area .",

    "msg candidates from different redshift bins are merged into a single candidate if the projected separation between them is less than 2 mpc , and their redshift bins overlap with each other .",
    "we estimated the fraction of bona fide member galaxies in this approach using a galaxy mock catalog of galform @xcite .",
    "for this , we randomly scatter mock galaxy redshifts with @xmath39 above , and then select galaxies with @xmath57 and within 1.0 and 1.5 mpc radii from central galaxies of 346 massive halos at @xmath58 , where @xmath59 indicates the halo redshift .",
    "the average fractions of bona fide members among selected galaxies are 50% and 30% for 1.0 and 1.5 mpc , respectively .",
    "therefore , we select msg candidates , only if they have at least 25 galaxies ( @xmath60 ) within a 1.5 mpc radius and the photometric redshift uncertainty and with @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is characteristic magnitude ) . in total , there are 691 msg candidates .    in order to identify supercluster candidates",
    ", we count the number of msg candidates within a 10 mpc radius and the photometric redshift uncertainty from each msg candidate .",

    "multi - object spectroscopy was performed on 2014 september 23 , using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on the magellan / baade telescope in its f/2 mode of a field that covers a 27.4 diameter field of view at @xmath2222@xmath2313@xmath2408@xmath25 and @xmath26004024 .",
    "of supercluster candidates described in the previous section , we chose the target field due to its unusually high concentration in a small area : six prominent ( @xmath63 ) and nine less significant ( @xmath64 ) msg candidates , within a photometric redshift range of @xmath65 .",
    "slitlets were assigned to galaxies in prominent candidates first , and then to those in less significant candidates . in order to choose target galaxies for the spectroscopy",

    "the integrals of the normalized pdfs within the uncertainty range ( @xmath39 ) from the candidate redshift were calculated as the probability for each galaxy belonging to the cluster @xcite .",
    "galaxies with probabilities @xmath660.5 were selected as potential members .",
    "spectra of potential members were taken using the 200 lines mm@xmath4 grism with the wb56009200 filter ranging from 5600  to 9200 .",
    "one slit mask was used for the observation with 1@xmath676slitlets . in total ,",
    "320 slitlets were assigned for galaxies including potential msg members ( 80% ) and field galaxies ( 20% ) .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath68600 .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 2.5 hours ( 30 minutes@xmath675 ) under @xmath50.9 seeing .",

    "the flux calibration was performed using an f5-type star that was also included in the slit mask .",
    "the redshift of each galaxy was determined with the _ specpro _ software @xcite .",

    "if only a single emission line was detected , we considered this as the [ oii ] line .",
    "if the identified line was not [ oii ] , e.g. , such as h@xmath71 , h@xmath72 , [ oiii ] or h@xmath73 , it would likely be accompanied by another line at shorter or longer wavelengths and be at a redshift that is difficult to explain the continuum shape ( i.e. , at a redshift that is very different from photometric redshifts ) .",
    "we successfully determined the redshift of 217 galaxies , implying a success rate of @xmath570% .",
    "the success rate is @xmath580% for galaxies at @xmath74 . among successful spectroscopic measurements ,",
    "51% comes from a single emission , and 7% comes from ca h&k absorption lines .      using the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , we determine the membership of each galaxy . for this process",
    ", we follow the iterative algorithm described in @xcite . first , we select galaxies within a 1 mpc radius from the cluster position determined by the photometric redshift method in   [ finclu ] .",
    "then , we calculate the bi - weight mean ( @xmath76 ) and scale ( @xmath77 ) of redshifts of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "we exclude galaxies with @xmath78 or the relative rest - frame radial velocity greater than 3500 kms@xmath4 .",
    "this process is repeated until no more galaxies are excluded . finally , the dispersion ( @xmath79 ) is calculated by the gapper method due to the small number of members and then converted into the velocity dispersion ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath80 are estimated by the jackknife resampling . through this process , we identify three galaxy clusters at @xmath81 with @xmath82470 kms@xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath83 at the cluster redshift @xcite .",
    "table  [ tcl ] lists the properties of the confirmed clusters based on two different radii of 1 mpc and 1.5 mpc for the comparison .",
    "independently , we estimated the uncertainty in @xmath80 by randomly selecting 100 times 11 and 7 spectroscopic members within a 1 mpc radius of the centers of two galaxy clusters at @xmath84 containing @xmath520 - 30 galaxies each with @xmath85490 - 650 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we find that the standard deviation from this exercise to be 160 km s@xmath4 and 320 km s@xmath4 for the 11 and 7 member cases , respectively , which are consistent with or smaller than the jackknife resampling errors in table  [ tcl ] .",
    "figure 1a shows example spectra of cluster members in the three confirmed clusters .",
    "vertical lines indicate locations of [ oii ] ( blue ) , ca h&k ( red ) , and h@xmath49 ( magenta ) lines .",
    "figure 1b displays the spectroscopic redshift distribution of confirmed members for each cluster .",
    "the fraction of members of which spectroscopic redshifts are determined by a single line is 55% , 29% , and 0% for imscl j2212 + 0045 , imscl j2213 + 0052 and imscl j2213 + 0048 , respectively .",
    "note that the velocity dispersion based only on red galaxies could decrease as much as @xmath550% of that from both blue and red galaxies @xcite .",
    "when we did a similar analysis on two clusters where at least 5 and 4 red galaxies ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) are available ( j2212 + 0045 and j2213 + 0048 ) , @xmath80 becomes 200@xmath88149 and 1117@xmath88464 km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath80 values in table  [ tcl ] could be overestimated .",

    "of our clusters , imscl j2213 + 0052 and imscl j2213 + 0048 have counterparts in their list , considering a matching radius of 3  ( @xmath51.5 mpc at @xmath75 ) and @xmath89 .",
    "interestingly , all the new clusters are massive and located at redshifts of @xmath20.9080.920 .",
    "in addition , the maximum projected angular separation between galaxy clusters is 16.78 , which corresponds to @xmath515 mpc ( comoving ) at the cluster redshift .",
    "the proximity of the three massive clusters suggests that this is a supercluster .",
    "compared to galaxy clusters in the cl 1604 supercluster with a maximum velocity dispersion of @xmath5800 km s@xmath4 , the supercluster presented here may encompass one or more clusters that are more massive and is more comparable to the rcs 2319 + 00 supercluster members ( 7101200 km s@xmath4 ) and members in the elais - n1 field ( 6601000 km s@xmath4 ) . additionally , the maximum projected angular separation is similar to that for the three most massive clusters in cl 1604 ( 16.24 ) , larger than rcs 2319 + 00 ( 7.62 ) , and smaller than the elais - n1 supercluster ( 32.45 ) .",
    "this new supercluster in the ssa22 field may be one of the most massive structures ever found at @xmath20.9 .",
    "we summarize the properties of the known superclusters in table  [ tcl ] .",
    "in order to see if there are more structures beyond the confirmed clusters through a galaxy density map , we apply the voronoi tessellation technique described in   [ finclu ] to the redshift bin at @xmath90 , the mean redshift of the confirmed clusters .",
    "then , we make a grid map with a grid cell size of 500 kpc across the entire ssa22 area and calculate the mean value of local densities ( @xmath49 in   [ finclu ] ) for each grid .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "comparing the density map and the distribution of spectroscopic samples , it seems that the supercluster extends the northeast direction .",
    "note that no spectroscopic redshifts are available in the southwest area .",
    "the density map suggests that the supercluster possibly extends to a much larger scale .",
    "first , we search for dark matter halos grouped similarly to our confirmed clusters from the millennium simulation @xcite with the wmap-7 cosmology @xcite .",
    "we use 15 snapshots from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , each with a 0.32 gpc@xmath95 cube ( i.e. , five times the volume of our data at @xmath1 ) . at @xmath96 , the first structures with properties comparable to the new supercluster form , i.e. , those containing at least three halos , each in excess of @xmath97 .",
    "two such structures appear at this redshift .",
    "by @xmath42 , three or four such structures have formed . when translated to our survey volume",
    ", the simulation suggests @xmath50.60.8 superclusters at @xmath1 .",
    "if we use the millennium simulation with @xmath98 , the number is comparable in this redshift range .",
    "second , we calculate the predicted number of superclusters based on the supercluster mass function of @xcite . as a conservative estimate",
    ", we set the supercluster mass at @xmath99 . using their mass function at @xmath100 ,",
    "the predicted number of superclusters with @xmath101 in the 20 deg@xmath16 area with @xmath1 is @xmath50.6 .",
    "the expected numbers of superclusters from the models are consistent with the number of superclusters we identified so far .",
    "however , there are still two more supercluster candidates in the ssa22 field , and extended structures as discussed in   [ lss ] may contain more superclusters . on the other hand , considering the uncertainty of cluster masses , the clusters can be lighter .",
    "if so , the observation and the model predictions can be reconciled since lighter superclusters are more abundant than heavier ones in models . to understand if there is any tension between observed superclusters and @xmath0cdm models , it is necessary to do a more thorough analysis of larger cosmological simulations and an intensive spectroscopic mapping of these large structures .",

    "<S> the @xmath0cdm cosmological model successfully reproduces many aspects of the galaxy and structure formation of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> however , the growth of large - scale structures ( lsss ) in the early universe is not well tested yet with observational data . here , </S>",
    "<S> we have utilized wide and deep optical  near - infrared data in order to search for distant galaxy clusters and superclusters ( @xmath1 ) . from the spectroscopic observation with the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on the magellan telescope , </S>",
    "<S> three massive clusters at @xmath20.91 are confirmed in the ssa22 field . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , all of them have similar redshifts within @xmath30.01 with velocity dispersions ranging from 470 to 1300 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as the maximum separation is @xmath515 mpc , they compose a supercluster at @xmath20.91 , meaning that this is one of the most massive superclusters at this redshift to date . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy density map implies that the confirmed clusters are embedded in a larger structure stretching over @xmath5100 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0cdm models predict about one supercluster like this in our surveyed volume , consistent with our finding so far . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are more supercluster candidates in this field , suggesting that additional studies are required to determine if the @xmath0cdm cosmological model can successfully reproduce the lsss at high redshift . </S>"
