    "these features can be explained by the fact that in nearly adiabatic regions convection is more efficient in the cgm s formulation ( see details in heiter et al , 2002 ) .",

    "kcgm and ecgm models have very similar convective structures .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the kcgm model results in a value of @xmath4 close to that required for the atmosphere ( @xmath36 ) .    for the kmlt model",

    "in contrast for the kcgm the discontinuity is much less important . these features",
    "are again directly connected with the differences between between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "_ conclusion _ : both the kmlt and the kcgm models reproduce the balmer line profile and the solar radius and luminosity but the cgm model models the transition between the region of high convective efficiency ( the interior ) and the region of low efficiency ( the atmosphere ) in a much better way than the mlt treatment .",
    "results of the calculations of the excitation rates @xmath0 are presented in fig .",
    "the excitation rates @xmath0 inferred from the observations by chaplin et al ( 1998 ) are also represented for comparison .    for the mlt treatment , the rates p do significantly depend on the properties of the atmosphere .",

    ", they clearly favor the cgm treatment with respect to the mlt one .    the remaining discrepancy between computed and observed p ( fig .",
