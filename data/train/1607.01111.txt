    "mentioned work , experimental study showed that the nano - structured fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 can be potentially used as photovoltaic material@xcite . a similar study on highly crystalline nano - structured fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 was performed experimentally by park and co - workers@xcite .",
    "it is quite certain that there are interesting features that can be established in the olivine structure other than the well - known magnetic properties .",

    "the self - consistent calculations included spin - orbit coupling . since the calculations using standard local - density ( lda ) or generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) schemes for the exchange - correlation potential underestimate the band gaps of semiconductors , we have used the tran - blaha modified becke - johnson@xcite potential ( tb - mbj)@xcite on top of gga - pbe(perdew - burke - ernzerhof ) @xcite , which is quite good at reproducing the experimental band gaps . for k - space integrations ,",

    "the valence band maximum ( vbm ) is at @xmath43 and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) is observed along @xmath44 for fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 , which result in an indirect band gap semiconductor , in agreement with the earlier work@xcite .",
    "similar behaviour of indirect band gap is also seen in fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 along @xmath44 of vbm and at @xmath45 in cbm .",
    "but fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 is found to be a direct band gap semiconductor with the vbm and cbm both occurring at @xmath45 point . as indicated previously",
    ", the octahedron formed by @xmath12 and @xmath2 provides the hybridisation between @xmath46 states . according to the octahedronl crystal field splitting ,",
    "the @xmath47 orbitals are divided into three filled @xmath48 and empty doublet @xmath49 states .",
    "the representation of the crystal field splitting of @xmath12-@xmath50 is shown schematically in fig .",
    "3 . the filled triplet states of @xmath48 will contribute to the vbm as non - bonding states , with very small contribution from @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the empty doublet states of @xmath51 interact with the chalcogen-@xmath53 states and form the bonding states below the vbm .",
    "the higher energy states of @xmath51 and chalcogen-@xmath53 forms the anti - bonding states which contribute to the cbm .",
    "the crystal field splitting is very similar to that of the prototype rh@xmath0zno@xmath9 , in the low spin state of the @xmath54@xcite .",
    "the @xmath55-states reside much below in the valence band .",
    "the corresponding density of states ( dos ) of all the compounds is shown in fig .",
    "4 . from this figure",
    ", it is evident that at both the band edges , @xmath47 states are more dominant in all the compounds , but in the case of valence band , we also find the chalcogen-@xmath53 states to contribute a little ( see fig .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath12 and @xmath17 states at the vbm and cbm is almost very similar to that of the pyrite , since the @xmath55 character in fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 is much below the valence band .",
    "this shows the evidence of similarity between the olivine fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and pyrite fes@xmath0@xcite . to further analyse the contribution of each element to the total dos",
    ", we have also plotted the orbital resolved dos e.g. @xmath56-projected dos of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 , which is shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) .",
    "the slight difference observed in the contribution of the two @xmath12 states in the dos at the fermi level may be due to the different orientation of the fech@xmath57 octahedron resulting in different bond lengths of @xmath58 and @xmath59 with sulphur as mentioned above .",
    "the states below @xmath60 in the valence band are due to the @xmath52 orbital . the crystal orbital overlap populations ( coop )",
    "analysis of fe@xmath0sis@xmath9 has also shown similar type of bonding@xcite .",
    "we further investigated the nature of bonding among the elemental species in fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and the charge density plot is shown in fig .",
    "this shows that the bonding between @xmath36 is a weak covalent bond , while @xmath61 form strong covalent bond .",
    "the covalent bonding between @xmath36 is comparatively stronger along @xmath6 and @xmath7- axes of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "5(b ) and 5(c ) ) , which might indicate a better flow of charge carriers along these two axes compared to the other axis @xmath62 .",
    "this might be due to the presence of edge - sharing octahedron along the @xmath6-axis which is layered through @xmath7-axis , resulting a strong covalent bonding between @xmath36 along the @xmath6- and @xmath7- axes , while along the @xmath62-axis the effect of edge and vertex sharing is weak which eventually lower the covalent bonding nature along this direction .",
    "in addition , it is to be noted that lattice parameter is larger along the @xmath62-axis leading to lesser interaction resulting in weak bond along the respective crystallographic direction , leading to a weak charge flow resulting in low electrical conductivity along @xmath62-axis which is discussed in the later section . from the band structure of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9",
    "it is quite evident that the dispersion of bands along the three crystallographic directions i. e. @xmath45-x , @xmath45-y and @xmath45-z are very flat in nature , which can result in a sharp increase in the dos at the band edges .",
    "we observe almost an identical increase in dos at both the edges in all the compounds , which might indicate a favourable condition for the band dependent properties like thermopower for both the carriers .    the basis of the present study is to predict the thermoelectric properties of fe@xmath0gech@xmath9 as a function of carrier concentration at various temperatures .",
    "for this purpose one need to study the effective mass of both the carriers at the band edges .",
    "we have calculated the effective mass at the conduction and valence band edges by fitting the energy of the respective bands to a quadratic polynomial in the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath63 .",
    "the calculated effective mass of the bands along @xmath64 , @xmath44 and @xmath65 directions are shown in table - i .",
    "lower values of the effective mass are observed for cbm compared to vbm .",
    "the effective mass values of both vbm and cbm ( except along @xmath65 of cbm ) are found to decrease from sulphur to tellurium among the investigated compounds along the three directions mentioned above .",
    "effective mass of the carriers of both fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 are almost similar ( slightly lesser for fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 ) which is because of the similar band structure of these two compounds , whereas in the case of fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 we find the effective mass of the carriers to be lower , resulting from the highly dispersive bands along the specified directions as mentioned above .",
    "the higher values of the effective mass of the carriers at both band edges might indicate a high thermopower in fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 . with this preliminary idea",
    ", we have calculated the transport properties for optimised doping levels of the carriers and is discussed in the next section .",
    "the effective mass values of the olivine fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 are higher in comparison with the marcasite and pyrite fes@xmath0 , which shows that the thermopower of olivine type of minerals may have higher value than the marcasite and pyrite , which is seen in the present calculation and the same is explained in the next section .",
    "we now look into the thermoelectric properties of fe@xmath0gech@xmath9 .",
    "the uniform increase in dos at both the edges suggest that these materials might show favourable thermoelectric properties for both the carrier concentrations .",
    "this allow us to calculate the carrier concentration dependent thermoelectric properties such as thermopower ( @xmath17 in @xmath66 @xmath67 ) and electrical conductivity scaled by relaxation time ( @xmath68 in @xmath69 ) using boltztrap code within the limit of rba and csta as mentioned in section - ii at various temperatures for both electrons and holes . as mentioned earlier , the olivine type structure is non - cubic , and it becomes very important to analyse the direction dependent thermoelectric properties e.g. along @xmath62 , @xmath6 and @xmath7- directions . from the earlier studies it is quite evident that the direction dependent thermoelectric properties are very important due to the anisotropic nature of the systems@xcite .",
    "for example , the delafossite type ptcoo@xmath0 and pdcoo@xmath0 revealed the importance of the anisotropic nature of the thermoelectric properties , where we can find a huge difference in the thermoelectric properties along the in - plane and out - of - plane directions@xcite .",
    "keeping in view of the above consideration , we have calculated the direction dependent thermoelectric properties such as @xmath17 and @xmath68 , and are presented in fig .",
    "6 - 8 , for all the compounds for both the holes ( n@xmath70 for holes ) and electrons ( n@xmath71 for electrons ) as carriers . from the thermopower of all the compounds , we observed that there is no bipolar conduction seen in the case of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "6(a ) and 7(a ) ) because of the higher band gaps ( @xmath72 ) , whereas in fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "8(a ) ) we see a bipolar conduction at higher concentration in the case of holes and at lower concentration in the case of electrons .",
    "the reason for the bipolar conduction in fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 may be because of low band gap ( @xmath73 ) . from fig .",
    "6 , it is clear that the thermopower of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 is found to vary from @xmath74 for the optimum hole concentration of @xmath75 , whereas for electrons , it is found to be @xmath76 , and the range of the thermopower values are apparently very high at 300 @xmath13 and 500 @xmath13 temperatures in comparison with the traditional thermoelectric materials@xcite .",
    "for example the commercially used thermoelectric material bi@xmath0te@xmath26 has a thermopower of @xmath77 at room temperature@xcite , and we find the same value of the thermopower even at the high concentration around @xmath78 in fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 at room temperature ( the thermopower value is still higher at lower concentrations ) .",
    "this shows that fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 might be having a very high thermopower for both the carriers . in the case of fe@xmath0gese@xmath9",
    ", the thermopower is found to be slightly lower compared to fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 because of the effective mass being smaller as seen from table - i , but it is also shown to be more promising for both the carriers . in the case of fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 , we found a lower thermopower values compared to the other two chalcogens , which is because of the lower values of the effective mass of the carriers in this compound .",
    "thermopower is found to be below @xmath79 at a hole concentration of @xmath80 , whereas we found slightly higher values compared to holes in the case of electrons .",
    "but there exist a bipolar conduction in the case of electrons at lower concentration region .",
    "anisotropy in thermopower is seen in all the compounds along all three crystallographic axes .",
    "we also observed that the anisotropy is found to increase as we move down the chalcogens for both the carriers .",
    "earlier experiments on fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 have shown a bulk thermopower of @xmath81 at room temperature and from our study also , we find the same value of thermopower at room temperature for the following concentrations of @xmath82 along @xmath62-axis , @xmath83 along @xmath6-axis and @xmath84 along @xmath7-axis for the holes@xcite . the above mentioned concentrations along the three directions can be achieved well within the experimental conditions for the semiconductors . in case of the electrons we found the carrier concentration to be below @xmath80 for the same thermopower of @xmath81 at room temperature .",
    "the calculated thermopower of @xmath81 for fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 at room temperature is in good agreement with the measured single crystal bulk thermopower of @xmath81 at a concentration around @xmath85@xcite .",
    "this shows that the predicted thermopower values are in line with the experimental results . in comparison with the marcasite fes@xmath0 ( @xmath86 )",
    ", the thermopower of olivine type fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 ( @xmath87 ) has higher value at a hole concentration of @xmath78 .",
    "we find a similar value of the thermopower of pyrite fes@xmath0 ( @xmath88 ) with that of the olivine type fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 ( @xmath88 ) at the same concentration as mentioned above .",
    "this indicates that olivine can show better thermoelectric performance if it possess high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity . the electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time",
    "is discussed in the succeeding section .    the electrical conductivity , in all the compounds is found to be more for electrons compared to the holes .",
    "the difference in the electrical conductivity for the electrons is almost one order more compared to the holes .",
    "we also observe a huge anisotropy along @xmath62-axis compared to the @xmath6 and @xmath7-axes .",
    "the @xmath68 along the @xmath62-axis is almost two orders lower throughout the optimum concentrations for both the carriers for all the compounds .",
    "this might due to the higher value of lattice parameter @xmath89 compared to @xmath90 and @xmath91 and also weak covalent bonding nature along this direction compared to other two axes as mentioned earlier .",
    "a similar situation of lower electrical conductivity along the direction of larger lattice parameter was also found in the case of @xmath92 crystal@xcite . as seen in the bonding ,",
    "the interaction or the extent of hybridisation along the @xmath62-axis is also lesser .",
    "we found a significantly lower anisotropy between the @xmath6 and @xmath7-axes in all the compounds .",
    "this eventually confirm that the thermoelectric performance of the investigated compounds show better applications along the @xmath6 and @xmath7-axes compared to the @xmath62-axis .",
    "the value of electrical conductivity is found to increase as we move down the chalcogen group throughout the hole concentration .",
    "but in the case of electrons it is found to be a non - monotonic variation , where it decreases from fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 to fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 followed by an increase in fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 within the optimum electron concentration .",
    "electrical conductivity of fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 is found to be slightly higher compared to fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 in the case of electrons .",
    "but the bipolar nature of thermopower as seen in fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 will not make it suitable for good thermoelectric performance .",
    "this allow us to state that among the investigated olivine type of structures both fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 emerge as good thermoelectric candidates for both the charge carriers . in order to understand the lower values along the @xmath62-direction",
    ", we further estimated the order of the mobility scaled by the relaxation time ( @xmath93 ) and is shown in fig .",
    "9 . from this figure",
    "it is quite evident that the mobility of both carrier concentrations along the @xmath62-axis is very low compared to the other two axes , which resulted in two orders lower electrical conductivity along @xmath62-axis .",
    "the lower value of the mobility along the @xmath62-axis is consistent with the charge flow as mentioned in the section iiia .",
    "we further studied the power - factor ( @xmath94 ) of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 and is shown in fig .",
    "6(c ) and 7(c ) .",
    "the power factor for electrons ( above @xmath95 ) is slightly higher compared to the holes ( below @xmath95 ) for fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 , and it is because of the high electrical conductivity of electrons compared to the hole concentration of @xmath96 .",
    "but in the case of fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 we find nearly equal values for both electrons as well as holes ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the calculated power factor of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 are found to be almost similar to the marcasite and pyrite structures of the fes@xmath0@xcite and fese@xmath0@xcite .",
    "however , we have seen earlier that the thermopower of olivine type fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 has higher value compared to the marcasite and almost nearly equal value with pyrite fes@xmath0 , but we find a lower values of power factor which is because of the lower electrical conductivity of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 , compared to marcasite ( @xmath100 ) and pyrite ( @xmath101 ) ( all the values are at @xmath78 hole concentration ) . even though electrical conductivity of olivine is lower , they possess almost comparable power factor with that of pyrite fes@xmath0 which implies that one need to improve the electrical conductivity of olivine to get a better te performance . in general , we find the olivine type of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 to be good thermoelectric candidates along the crystallographic directions of @xmath6 and @xmath7-axes .",
    "overall , the less dispersive bands along the high symmetry directions is responsible for the higher thermopower in olivine fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 .",
    "we find a thermopower of above @xmath102 at @xmath103 and @xmath104 at a concentration of @xmath78 in both the compounds .",
    "this higher values of thermopower together with the assumption that these materials might possess low thermal conductivity can certainly lead to good thermoelectric performance . as suggested by tritt et .",
    ", the minimum thermopower a material should possess to have a @xmath105 in the considerable range of around @xmath106 , assuming zero lattice thermal conductivity @xcite . in the present case , we find the thermopower to be high in both fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 , even at the higher carrier concentration of @xmath78 for both electrons and holes .",
    "earlier studies on fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 show this compound to possess a high absorption coefficient ( @xmath107)@xcite which imply their usage as a good photovoltaic absorber , which is almost similar to the pyrite fes@xmath0 . in the present study we also found a better thermoelectric performance of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 compared to marcasite and pyrite fes@xmath0 .",
    "this allow us to state that olivine type compounds can be used as an alternate energy source of material for both thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications .",
    "we further look forward for the experiments in order to validate the proposed nature of the solar thermoelectric behaviour of the investigated systems .",
    "we present here the thermoelectric properties of olivine structure type of fe@xmath0gech@xmath9 ( ch = s , se and te ) based on the boltzmann semi - classical transport equation using first principle calculations .",
    "the investigated thermoelectric properties showed fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 and fe@xmath0gese@xmath9 to have a high thermopower above @xmath108 even at room temperature and above , which is unusual and can be placed in different regime of the thermoelectric family .",
    "we found a good agreement between the calculated hole concentration with the experimental measured carrier concentration of fe@xmath0ges@xmath9 at room temperature .",
    "the other interesting feature of these materials is the negligible anisotropy in the thermopower for the above two compounds , whereas electrical conductivity is two order less along @xmath62-axis compared with other two axes of @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "bipolar thermoelectric nature is observed in fe@xmath0gete@xmath9 because of the narrow band gap .",
