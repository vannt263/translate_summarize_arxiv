    "during the last decade particle physics cosmology matured from the realm of speculation to that of testable predictability . the next generation of satellite and balloon borne experiments will provide an unprecedented test of the fundamental ideas of early universe cosmology and will validate or rule out current theories of structure formation and other aspects of the cosmology of the early universe@xcite .",
    "standard big bang cosmology is based on a homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe and is confirmed by observations : i ) redshifts of objects far away have been measured and confirm hubble s law of expansion , ii ) the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) has been measured to be an almost perfect blackbody with temperature @xmath1 and is a remnant of the early hot and dense stages of evolution after the big bang , iii ) light element abundance of @xmath2 which is consistent with what is predicted by nucleosynthesis .",
    "the cmbr gives evidence of homogeneity and isotropy on scales larger than about 100 mpc , with small temperature fluctuations @xmath3 on angular scales that range from @xmath4 to about @xmath5@xcite .",
    "this high degree of homogeneity and isotropy on large scales presents one of the important puzzles of standard big bang cosmology , i.e. the horizon problem .",
    "distances in a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic cosmology are measured with the frw metric @xmath6 with @xmath7 the comoving or cosmic time and @xmath8 the scale factor .",
    "physical distances along null geodesics determine the limit of causal correlations .",
    "these are given by @xmath9 this distance determines the causal horizon , events that are separated by distances larger than @xmath10 can not be causally correlated by microphysical processes .",
    "another important physical scale is the hubble radius @xmath11 . in the cases of interest ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath12 are proportional and we will call @xmath12 the horizon indistinguishably .",
    "let us consider a physical distance today @xmath13 over which the cmbr determines homogeneity and isotropy to one part in @xmath14 . at a time",
    "@xmath7 earlier , the size of this patch is given by @xmath15 ( where we have chosen @xmath16 ) .",
    "for a matter or radiation dominated universe ( most of the life of the universe ) , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 for radiation , @xmath19 for matter domination ) . the horizon size ( or hubble radius )",
    "is given by @xmath20 and the ratio @xmath21 increases as we evolve back to an earlier epoch .",
    "thus at some time in the far past , the scale @xmath13 will become larger than the horizon .",
    "in particular , if @xmath22 this scale will be larger than the horizon near the time of decoupling of matter and radiation , at red - shifts @xmath23 , and therefore it is extremely difficult to explain how such a region which was causally disconnected at decoupling can be so homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this is the essence of the horizon problem@xcite .",
    "inflation was proposed over a decade ago to solve long standing problems of standard big bang cosmology such as the homogeneity and horizon problems@xcite .",
    "inflation corresponds to a stage of exponential expansion of the universe during which the hubble radius ( horizon ) remains constant and physical scales grow exponentially .",
    "thus , in this scenario , microphysical scales smaller than the horizon over which causal processes establish correlations cross the horizon during the inflationary stage .",
    "after the inflationary stage and through particle physics processes ( reheating ) , the universe becomes radiation and matter dominated and the scales that had crossed outside the hubble radius during the inflationary stage , re - enter the horizon .",
    "perturbations on these scales then grow under gravitational ( jeans ) instability to form the large scale structures that we see today .",
    "thus the inflationary proposal solves the homogeneity and horizon problems by allowing scales to cross the horizon _ twice _ , from being subhorizon initially becoming superhorizon during inflation , and re - entering the horizon during the period of radiation or matter domination .    quantum field theory combined with particle physics models provides the framework to implement the inflationary idea . for an inflationary stage",
    "the equation of state has to be dominated by a term similar to a cosmological constant leading to a negative pressure . through the einstein - friedmann equations , this yields to an exponential expansion of the scale factor .",
    "there are many different inflationary scenarios : ` old ' , ` new ' , ` natural ' , ` hybrid ' etc.@xcite , but despite the plethora of different implementations of the original idea , there are some robust features of inflation common to practically all models : i ) inflation predicts a _ flat _ universe , i.e. the total energy density at all times is the critical energy density , ii ) an almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar density perturbations , with amplitudes that are bound by the cmbr inhomogeneities @xmath24 , iii ) approximately scale invariant spectrum of gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) .",
    "the next generation of satellites ( map / planck ) will provide more stringent bounds on temperature inhomogeneities and a firmer determination of the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations , and the next generation of gravitational wave detectors ( ligo , virgo , lisa ) may detect the gravitational waves and their spectrum .",
    "determinations of the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations will provide stringent bounds on inflationary models based on particle physics scenarios and probably will validate or rule out specific proposals .",
    "although the general features of inflation seem robust and universal , the implementation of the inflationary stage as well as the departure from scale invariance of the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations depend on the concrete model and its dynamics . in this article",
    "we focus on the study of the dynamics of specific new inflationary scenarios that lead to an inflationary stage after a phase transition .",
    "an appealing new inflation scenario envisages a phase transition at gut scales that provides an inflationary stage@xcite .",
    "the concept is an extension of well understood features of phase transitions in model field theories and has been studied within the context of inflationary cosmology in a fixed background by linde and vilenkin@xcite and guth and pi@xcite .",
    "consider a scalar field theory ( we will neglect fermions , gauge fields and other exotic components in the discussion ) with a typical ` mexican hat ' potential that allows for broken symmetry states .",
    "if the system is originally at very high temperature , larger than critical , i.e. @xmath25 , the ` effective ' potential has a minimum when the expectation value of the scalar field ( the order parameter ) vanishes .",
    "as the temperature cools below critical , the effective potential develops minima away from the origin and the expectation value of the scalar field will roll toward the minima , i.e. the equilibrium values .",
    "consider as a relevant example the following scalar potential @xmath26\\;\\phi^2 + \\frac{m^4}{4\\lambda } , \\label{veff } \\\\",
    "m^2[t ]           & = & m^2\\left[\\frac{t^2}{t^2_c}-1\\right ] ,   \\label{masoft } \\\\",
    "t(t )   & = & \\frac{t_i}{a(t ) } \\ ; \\ ; ; \\ ; \\ ; t_c \\propto \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the time dependence in the temperature results from considering a resummation of the fluctuation contribution to the effective mass in an frw cosmology at finite temperature@xcite , akin to the hard thermal loop resummation . assuming that the heat bath arises from particles and radiation at high temperature and that at temperatures larger than the critical the system is in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with @xmath27 , einstein s equation for the hubble ` constant ' becomes @xmath28,\\ ] ] with @xmath29 being a constant that depends on the particle content of the theory . at the time at which the phase transition takes place , that is when @xmath30 , the universe is still dominated by radiation , since @xmath31 for weakly coupled theories .",
    "thus we reach the first conclusion : that if a phase transition is driven by the cooling of the expanding universe , such a phase transition will occur during the radiation dominated era .",
    "the inflationary period of exponential ( de sitter ) expansion will occur when @xmath32 when the vacuum energy dominates , which will happen after several e - folds of radiation dominated expansion , once the effective temperature has red - shifted to almost zero .",
    "the small inhomogeneities of the cmbr restrict the scalar self coupling in these models to be @xmath33@xcite ( this will also be understood later when we compute the amplitude of scalar perturbations ) , and assuming lte may be unjustified in these weakly coupled theories .",
    "however , even _ if _ lte holds for short wavelength modes of the field theory it is unlikely to hold for the long wavelength modes .",
    "the reason for this is the following : at the phase transition when @xmath34 the hubble constant is @xmath35 ) $ ] . assuming the de sitter stage of exponential inflation to occur at a gut scale",
    ", this implies that @xmath36 with the result that at the time of the phase transition @xmath37 , i.e. the horizon size is much smaller than the compton wavelength of the scalar particle .",
    "this prevents thermalization of long wavelength modes even when the short wavelength modes may be strongly coupled to the bath and reach lte .",
    "thus our second conclusion : the phase transition will be strongly supercooled , with the long wavelength modes falling quickly out of lte , even when lte prevailed for short wavelength modes .",
    "the dynamics must necessarily be studied away from quasi - equilibrium and any approach based on effective potentials will miss important physics .    thus the phase transition can be described as a sudden quench from the high temperature phase at @xmath38 into the low temperature phase with @xmath39 on time scales much shorter than the microscopic time scales for thermalization and relaxation@xcite .",
    "if the initial state was disordered in the sense that the expectation value of the order parameter is zero , then the phase transition occurs with the order parameter sitting at the top of the potential .",
    "because of the symmetry @xmath40 a state with @xmath41 will maintain vanishing value of the order parameter under the dynamics , and the rolling of the field down its potential hill necessary to end the inflationary stage must be understood as a consequence of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "we have argued previously@xcite that under these circumstances long wavelength fluctuations will grow almost exponentially in a manner very similar to spinodal decomposition and phase separation in condensed matter systems .",
    "the quantum fluctuations as measured by the equal time two - point correlation function of the field @xmath42 must grow@xcite in such a way that the mean square root fluctuation of the field @xmath43 will eventually sample the minima of the potential and reach an equilibrium state .",
    "that is to say that at long times , when a quasi - equilibrium state has been achieved , it must be that @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the quantum fluctuations must become _ non - perturbatively _ large .",
    "hence we reach a third conclusion : if the expectation value of the scalar field is at the top of the potential hill with vanishingly small velocity during the inflationary epoch , quantum fluctuations that are responsible for the process of phase separation will grow non - perturbatively large .",
    "therefore the dynamics must necessarily be studied within a non - perturbative framework .",
    "although new inflationary scenarios were previously studied@xcite , our work is rather different in that it addresses the description of the dynamics _ including _ self - consistently and non - perturbatively the non - equilibrium growth of quantum fluctuations and their effect on the dynamics of the scale factor .",
    "having reached this conclusion on the non - perturbative growth of the quantum fluctuations one is presented with unsettling puzzles : typically the scalar field is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is assumed to be the zero mode or expectation value of the scalar field and @xmath47 the _ small _ quantum fluctuations that are ultimately responsible for metric perturbations .",
    "inflation terminates when @xmath46 rolls down the potential hill and reaches the minimum , oscillating about it and eventually decaying into lighter particles leading to the reheating stage .    however , the scenario that is envisaged here is that of a quenched or supercooled phase transition in which @xmath48 throughout the evolution and the fluctuations grow to be very large and to eventually sample the minima of the potential .",
    "therefore one is led to the questions : a ) what is truly rolling down ?",
    ", b ) how does inflation end ? , c ) how sensitive is the dynamics to the initial value of the expectation value of the scalar field ?",
    ", d ) if the fluctuations grow to become non - perturbatively large will not they provide a large contribution to the energy momentum tensor and modify the frw dynamics ?",
    ", e ) can one make sense of small fluctuations to calculate density perturbations ? .",
    "even when the initial value of @xmath49 , an inflationary stage requires that it be sufficiently small for the energy density to be dominated by the vacuum term . under these circumstances",
    "the quantum fluctuations will nevertheless grow , and the dynamics must address not only the rolling of the expectation value , but also the growth of spinodal fluctuations .    the goal of the present work is to answer all of these questions .",
    "we will see below that it is precisely the large fluctuations that provide the sensible answers to all of the questions above , thus reconciling the naive picture of a scalar field rolling down the hill .",
    "furthermore , a detailed analysis of the dynamics will allow us to quantify the answer to these questions and , in particular , will allow a profound interpretation of the effective zero mode , its initial conditions , and the small fluctuations that will provide the small density perturbations .",
    "having recognized the non - perturbative dynamics of the long wavelength fluctuations we need to study the dynamics within a non - perturbative framework .",
    "we require that such framework be : i ) renormalizable , ii ) covariant energy conserving , iii ) numerically implementable .",
    "there are very few schemes that fulfill all of these criteria : the hartree and the large @xmath0 approximation@xcite .",
    "whereas the hartree approximation is basically a gaussian variational approximation@xcite that in general can not be consistently improved upon , the large @xmath0 approximation can be consistently implemented beyond leading order@xcite and in our case it has the added bonus of providing many light fields ( associated with goldstone modes ) that will permit the study the effects of other fields which are lighter than the inflaton on the dynamics .",
    "thus we will study the inflationary dynamics of a quenched phase transition within the framework of the large @xmath0 limit of a scalar theory in the vector representation of @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that the universe is spatially flat with a metric given by eq .",
    "( [ frw ] ) . the matter action and lagrangian density are given by @xmath51 \\label{action}\\ ] ] @xmath52 @xmath53 where we have included the coupling of @xmath54 to the scalar curvature @xmath55 since it will arise as a consequence of renormalization@xcite .",
    "the gravitational sector includes the usual einstein term in addition to a higher order curvature term and a cosmological constant term which are necessary to renormalize the theory .",
    "the lagrangian density for the gravitational sector is therefore : @xmath56.\\ ] ] with k being the cosmological constant . in principle",
    ", we also need to include the terms @xmath57 and @xmath58 as they are also terms of fourth order in derivatives of the metric ( fourth adiabatic order ) , but the variations resulting from these terms turn out not to be independent of that of @xmath59 in the flat frw cosmology we are considering .",

    "however , the leading order contribution can be obtained equivalently by invoking the factorization@xcite :    @xmath75    to obtain a large @xmath70 limit , we define@xcite @xmath76 where the large @xmath70 limit is implemented by the requirement that @xmath77 the leading contribution is obtained by neglecting the @xmath78 terms in the formal limit .",
    "the resulting lagrangian density is quadratic , with linear terms in @xmath79 and @xmath72 .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by imposing the tadpole conditions @xmath80 and @xmath81 which in this case are tantamount to requiring that the linear terms in @xmath79 and @xmath72 in the lagrangian density vanish .",

    "it proves illuminating to pass to conformal time variables in terms of the conformally rescaled fields ( see @xcite for a discussion ) in which the mode functions obey an equation which is very similar to that of harmonic oscillators with time dependent frequencies in minkowski space - time .",
    "it has been realized that different initial conditions on the mode functions lead to different renormalization counterterms@xcite ; in particular imposing initial conditions in comoving time leads to counterterms that depend on these initial conditions .",

    "the renormalization then proceeds much in the same manner as in reference@xcite ; the quadratic divergences renormalize the mass and the logarithmic terms renormalize coupling constant and the coupling to the ricci scalar .",

    "we can provide a criterion to separate classical from quantum dynamics by analyzing the relevant time scales , estimated by neglecting non - linearities and backreaction effects . considering the linear evolution of the zero mode in terms of dimensionless variables , and considering @xmath157 ( @xmath163 simply corresponds to a shift in origin of time ) ,",
    "we find @xmath164 the non - linearities will become important and eventually terminate inflation when @xmath165 .",
    "this corresponds to a time @xmath166 if @xmath167 is much smaller than the spinodal time @xmath168 given by eq.([spinodaltime ] ) then the _ classical _ evolution of the zero mode will dominate the dynamics and the quantum fluctuations will not become very large , although they will still undergo spinodal growth . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath169 the quantum fluctuations will grow to be very large well before the zero mode reaches the non - linear regime . in this case the dynamics will be determined completely by the quantum fluctuations .",
    "then the criterion for the classical or quantum dynamics is given by @xmath170 or in terms of dimensionfull variables @xmath171 leads to _ classical dynamics _ and @xmath172 leads to _",
    "quantum dynamics_.    however , even when the classical evolution of the zero mode dominates the dynamics , the quantum fluctuations grow exponentially after horizon crossing unless the value of @xmath162 is very close to the minimum of the tree level potential .",
    "in the large @xmath173 approximation the spinodal line , that is the values of @xmath162 for which there are spinodal instabilities , reaches all the way to the minimum of the tree level potential as can be seen from the equations of motion for the mode functions .",
    "therefore even in the classical case one must understand how to deal with quantum fluctuations that grow and become large after horizon crossing .",
    "the time evolution is carried out by means of a fourth order runge - kutta routine with adaptive stepsizing while the momentum integrals are carried out using an 11-point newton - cotes integrator .",
    "the relative errors in both the differential equation and the integration are of order @xmath109 .",
    "we find that the energy is covariantly conserved throughout the evolution to better than a part in a thousand .",
    "figures ( 1 - 3 ) show @xmath174 vs @xmath175 , @xmath176 vs. @xmath175 and @xmath177 vs @xmath175 for several values of @xmath178 with larger @xmath179 corresponding to successively lower curves .",
    "figures ( 4,5 ) show @xmath180 and the horizon size @xmath181 for @xmath182 and we have chosen the representative value @xmath183 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show clearly that when the contribution of the quantum fluctuations @xmath174 becomes of order 1 inflation basically ends , and the time scale for @xmath184 to reach @xmath151 is very well described by the estimate ( [ spinodaltime ] ) . from figure 1 we see that this happens for @xmath185 , leading to a number of e - folds @xmath186 which is correctly estimated by ( [ spinodaltime ] , [ efolds ] ) .",
    "figure 3 shows clearly the factorization of the modes after they cross the horizon given by eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) .",
    "the slopes of all the curves after they become straight lines in figure 3 is given exactly by @xmath187 , whereas the intercept depends on the initial condition on the mode function and the larger the value of @xmath188 the smaller the intercept because the amplitude of the mode function is smaller initially .",
    "although the intercept depends on the initial conditions on the long - wavelength modes , the slope is independent of the value of @xmath178 and is the same as what would be obtained in the linear approximation for the _ square _ of the zero mode at times long enough that the decaying solution can be neglected but short enough that the effect of the non - linearities is very small .",
    "notice from the figure that when inflation ends and the non - linearities become important all of the modes basically saturate .",
    "this is also what one would expect from the solution of the zero mode : exponential growth in early - intermediate times ( neglecting the decaying solution ) , with a growth exponent given by @xmath189 and an asymptotic behavior of small oscillations around the equilibrium position , which for the zero mode is @xmath190 , but for the @xmath191 modes depends on the initial conditions .",
    "all of the mode functions have this behavior once they cross the horizon .",
    "we have also studied the phases of the mode functions and we found that they ` freeze ' after horizon crossing .",
    "this is natural since both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath192 obey the same equation but with different boundary conditions .",
    "after the physical wavelength crosses the horizon , the dynamics is insensitive to the value of @xmath178 for real and imaginary parts and the phases become independent of time .",
    "again , this is a consequence of factorization .",
    "the growth of the quantum fluctuations is sufficient to end inflation at a time given by @xmath154 in eq .",
    "( [ spinodaltime ] ) .",
    "furthermore figure 4 shows that during the inflationary epoch @xmath193 and the end of inflation is rather sharp at @xmath154 with @xmath180 oscillating between @xmath194 with zero average over the cycles , resulting in matter domination .",
    "figure 5 shows this feature very clearly ; @xmath176 is constant during the de sitter epoch and becomes matter dominated after the end of inflation with @xmath195 , with @xmath196 the time at the end of inflation .",
    "there are small oscillations around this value because both @xmath197 and @xmath198 oscillate .",
    "these oscillations are a result of small oscillations of the mode functions after they saturate , and are also a feature of the solution for a zero mode .",
    "this remarkable feature of factorization of the mode functions after horizon crossing can be elegantly summarized as @xmath199 with @xmath200 a real function that obeys the zero mode equation ( [ zeromode ] ) , @xmath201 the physical momentum , and @xmath202 a complex constant . since the factor @xmath203 depends solely on the initial conditions on the mode functions , it turns out that for two mode functions corresponding to momenta @xmath204 that have crossed the horizon at times @xmath205 , the ratio of the two mode functions at time @xmath206 is @xmath207 .",
    "then if we consider the contribution of these modes to the _ renormalized _ quantum fluctuations a long time after the beginning of inflation ( so as to neglect the decaying solutions ) , we find that @xmath208 , where ` small ' stands for the contribution of mode functions associated with momenta that have not yet crossed the horizon at time @xmath175 , which give a perturbatively small ( of order @xmath209 ) contribution .",
    "then it is clear that after several e - folds from the beginning of inflation , we can define an ` effective zero mode ' as @xmath210^{\\frac{1}{2}}. \\label{effectivezeromode}\\ ] ] although this identification seems natural , we emphasize that it is by no means a trivial or ad - hoc statement .",
    "there are several important features that allow an _ unambiguous _ identification : i ) @xmath211 $ ] is a fully renormalized operator and hence finite , ii ) because of the factorization of the superhorizon modes that enter in the evaluation of @xmath211 $ ] , @xmath212 ( [ effectivezeromode ] ) _ obeys the equation of motion for the zero mode _ ,",
    "iii ) this identification is valid several e - folds after the beginning of inflation , after the transient decaying solutions have died away and the integral in @xmath95 is dominated by the modes with wavevector @xmath98 that have crossed the horizon at @xmath213 .",
    "numerically we see that this identification holds throughout the dynamics but for a very few e - folds at the beginning of inflation .",
    "this factorization determines at once the initial conditions of the effective zero mode that can be extracted numerically : after the first few efolds and long before the end of inflation we find @xmath214 where we parametrized @xmath215 to make contact with the literature .",
    "we find numerically that @xmath216 for a large range of @xmath217 and depends on the initial conditions of the long wavelength modes .",
    "the factorization of the superhorizon modes ( that dominate the integral ) implies that @xmath218 we also find numerically that even when @xmath157 this factorization phenomenon is very robust , and after a few e - folds from the beginning of inflation the dynamics is completely determined by the effective zero mode @xmath219 we have checked numerically that the dynamics of the scale factor and equation of state obtained from the full quantum problem is exactly equivalent to that obtained from the classical problem in terms of @xmath220 .",
    "we have also checked numerically that the estimate for the classical to quantum crossover given by eq.([classquandyn ] ) is quantitatively correct .",
    "thus in the classical case in which @xmath221 we find that @xmath222 whereas in the opposite , quantum case @xmath223 .",
    "we have run the numerical evolution of the scale factor with only the _ classical _ equation for @xmath224 with the proper initial conditions and found that it coincides within our numerical error with the evolution obtained by the full system of equations in either the classical or quantum case .",
    "this remarkable feature of the zero mode assembly of long - wavelength spinodally unstable modes is a consequence of the presence of the horizon",
    ". it also explains why despite the fact that asymptotically when the fluctuations sample the broken symmetry state , the equation of state is that of matter . since the excitations in the broken symmetry state are massless goldstone bosons one would expect radiation domination .",
    "however , the ` assembly ' phenomenon , i.e. the redshifting of the wave vectors , makes these modes behave exactly like zero momentum modes that give an equation of state of matter domination ( upon averaging over the small oscillations around the minimum ) .",
    "having recognized the effective classical variable that can be interpreted as the component of the field that drives the frw background and rolls down the classical potential hill , we want to recognize unambiguously the small fluctuations .",
    "we have argued above that after horizon crossing , all of the mode functions evolve proportionally to the zero mode , and the question arises : which modes are assembled into the effective zero mode and which modes are treated as perturbations ? in principle every @xmath225 mode provides some spatial inhomogeneity , and assembling these into an effective homogeneous zero mode seems in principle to do away with the very inhomogeneities that one wants to study .",
    "however , scales of cosmological importance today have first crossed the horizon during the last 60 or so e - folds of inflation .",
    "recently grishchuk@xcite has argued that the sensitivity of the measurements of @xmath24 probe inhomogeneities on scales @xmath226 times the size of the present horizon .",
    "therefore scales that are larger than these and that have first crossed the horizon much earlier than the last 60 e - folds of inflation are unobservable today and can be treated as an effective homogeneous component , whereas the scales that can be probed experimentally via the cmb inhomogeneities today must be treated separately as part of the inhomogeneous perturbations of the cmb .",
    "thus a consistent description of the dynamics in terms of an effective zero mode plus ` small ' quantum fluctuations can be given provided : a ) the total number of e - folds @xmath227 , b ) all the modes that have crossed the horizon _ before _",
    "the last 60 - 65 e - folds are assembled into an effective _ classical _ zero mode via @xmath228^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , c ) the modes that cross the horizon during the last 6065 e - folds are accounted as ` small ' perturbations .",
    "the reason for the requirement a ) is that in the separation @xmath229 one requires that @xmath230 .",
    "as argued above after the modes cross the horizon , the ratio of amplitudes of the mode functions remains constant and given by @xmath231 with @xmath232 being the number of e - folds between the crossing of the smaller @xmath233 and the crossing of the larger @xmath233 .",
    "then for @xmath234 to be much smaller than the effective zero mode , it must be that the fourier components of @xmath235 correspond to very large @xmath98 s at the beginning of inflation , so that the effective zero mode can grow for a long time before the components of @xmath235 begin to grow under the spinodal instabilities .",
    "in fact requirement a ) is not very severe ; in the figures ( 1 - 5 ) we have taken @xmath236 which is a very moderate value and yet for @xmath237 the inflationary stage lasts for over 100 e - folds , and as argued above , the larger @xmath128 for fixed @xmath209 , the longer is the inflationary stage .",
    "therefore under this set of conditions , the classical dynamics of the effective zero mode @xmath212 drives the frw background , whereas the inhomogeneous fluctuations @xmath47 , which are made up of fourier components with wavelengths that are much smaller than the horizon at the beginning of inflation and that cross the horizon during the last 60 e - folds , provide the inhomogeneities that seed density perturbations .",
    "having identified the effective zero mode and the ` small perturbations ' , we are now in position to provide an estimate for the amplitude and spectrum of scalar metric perturbations .",
    "we use the clear formulation by mukhanov , feldman and brandenberger@xcite in terms of gauge invariant variables .",
    "in particular we focus on the dynamics of the bardeen potential@xcite , which in longitudinal gauge is identified with the newtonian potential .",
    "the equation of motion for the fourier components ( in terms of comoving wavevectors ) for this variable in terms of the effective zero mode is@xcite @xmath238   \\dot{\\phi}_k+\\left[\\frac{k^2}{a^2(t)}+ 2\\left(\\dot{h}(t)-h(t ) \\frac{\\ddot{\\phi}_{eff}(t)}{\\dot{\\phi}_{eff}(t)}\\right)\\right]\\phi_k = 0 . \\label{bardeen}\\ ] ]    we are interested in determining the dynamics of @xmath239 for those wavevectors that cross the horizon during the last 60 e - folds before the end of inflation . during the inflationary stage",
    "the numerical analysis suggests that to a very good approximation @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the value of the hubble constant during inflation , leading to @xmath242 \\ ; ; \\ ; \\beta= \\nu-1 \\ ; . \\label{solbardeen}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath243 are determined by the initial conditions .",
    "since we are interested in the wavevectors that cross the horizon during the last 60 e - folds , the consistency for the zero mode assembly and the interpretation of ` small perturbations ' requires that there must be many e - folds before the _ last _ 60 .",
    "we are then considering wavevectors that were deep inside the horizon at the onset of inflation .",
    "mukhanov et .",
    "al.@xcite show that @xmath244 is related to the canonical ` velocity field ' that determines scalar perturbations of the metric and which is quantized with bunch - davies initial conditions for the large @xmath98-mode functions .",
    "the relation between @xmath239 and @xmath245 and the initial conditions on @xmath245 lead at once to a determination of the coefficients @xmath246 and @xmath247 for @xmath248@xcite @xmath249 \\dot{\\phi}_{eff}(0 ) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2h_0 } } \\frac{1}{k } \\ ; ; \\ ; b_k = 0 .",
    "\\label{coeffs}\\ ] ]    thus we find that the amplitude of scalar metric perturbations after horizon crossing is given by @xmath250 \\dot{\\phi}_{eff}(0 ) \\left(\\frac{2h_0}{k}\\right)^{\\nu -\\frac{3}{2 } } e^{(2\\nu-3)h_0t}. \\label{perts}\\ ] ] the power spectrum per logarithmic @xmath98 interval is given by @xmath251 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath252 displays the unstable growth associated with the spinodal instabilities of super - horizon modes and is a hallmark of the phase transition .",
    "this time dependence can be also understood from the constraint equation that relates the bardeen potential to the gauge invariant field fluctuations@xcite , which in longitudinal gauge are identified with @xmath47 . to obtain the amplitude and spectrum of density perturbations at _ second _ horizon crossing we use the conservation law associated with the gauge invariant variable@xcite @xmath253 which is valid after horizon crossing of the mode with wavevector k. using this conservation law , and the relation that during the inflationary stage @xmath254 , and assuming matter domination at second horizon crossing and @xmath255@xcite , we find @xmath256 where @xmath257 determines the initial amplitude of the effective zero mode ( [ effzeromodein ] ) .",
    "we can now read the power spectrum per logarithmic @xmath98 interval @xmath258 leading to the index for scalar density perturbations @xmath259 we remark that we have not included the small corrections to the dynamics of the effective zero mode and the scale factor arising from the non - linearities .",
    "these are expected to lead to perturbatively small @xmath260 corrections to the index ( [ index ] ) .",
    "the spectrum given by ( [ amplitude ] ) is similar to that obtained in references@xcite although the amplitude differs from that obtained there .",
    "we emphasize an important feature of the spectrum : it has more power at _ long wavelengths _ because @xmath261 .",
    "this is recognized to be a consequence of the spinodal instabilities that result in the growth of long wavelength modes and therefore in more power for these modes .",
    "this seems to be a robust prediction of new inflationary scenarios in which the potential has negative second derivative in the region of field space that produces inflation .",
    "it is at this stage that we recognize the consistency of our approach for separating the composite effective zero mode from the small fluctuations .",
    "we have argued above that many more than 60 e - folds are required for consistency , and that the ` small fluctuations ' correspond to those modes that cross the horizon during the last 60 e - folds of the inflationary stage . for these modes @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the time of horizon crossing of the mode with wavevector @xmath98 since the beginning of inflation . the scale that corresponds to the hubble radius today @xmath264 is the first to cross during the last 60 or so e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "smaller scales today will correspond to @xmath265 at the onset of inflation since they will cross the first horizon later and therefore will reenter earlier .",
    "the bound on @xmath266 on these scales provides a lower bound on the number of e - folds required for these type of models to be consistent : @xmath267 where we have written the total number of e - folds as @xmath268 .",
    "this in turn can be translated into an upper bound on the coupling constant using the estimate given by eq.([efolds ] ) .",
    "the program of reconstruction of the inflationary potential seeks to establish a relationship between features of the inflationary scalar potential and the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "this program , in combination with measurements of scalar and tensor components either from refined measurements of temperature inhomogeneities of the cmb or through galaxy correlation functions will then offer a glimpse of the possible realization of the inflation@xcite .",
    "such a reconstruction program is based on the slow roll approximation and the spectral index of scalar and tensor perturbations are obtained in a perturbative expansion in the slow roll parameters@xcite @xmath269 we can make contact with the reconstruction program by identifying @xmath162 above with our @xmath270 after the first few e - folds of inflation needed to assemble the effective zero mode from the quantum fluctuations .",
    "we have numerically established that for the weak scalar coupling required for the consistency of these models , the cosmologically interesting scales cross the horizon during the epoch in which @xmath271 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath272    with these identifications , and in the notation of@xcite the reconstruction program predicts the index for scalar density perturbations @xmath273 given by @xmath274 which coincides with the index for the spectrum given by the power spectrum per logarithmic interval @xmath275 with @xmath252 given by eq.([amplitude ] ) .",
    "we must note however that our treatment did not assume slow roll for which @xmath276 .",
    "our self - consistent , non - perturbative study of the dynamics plus the underlying requirements for the identification of a composite operator acting as an effective zero mode , validates the reconstruction program in weakly coupled new inflationary models .",
    "we have studied the non - equilibrium dynamics of a new inflation scenario in a self - consistent , non - perturbative framework based on a large @xmath70 expansion , including the dynamics of the scale factor and backreaction of quantum fluctuations .",
    "quantum fluctuations associated with superhorizon modes grow exponentially as a result of the spinodal instabilities and contribute to the energy momentum tensor in such a way as to end inflation consistently .",
    "analytical and numerical estimates have been provided that establish the regime of validity of the classical approach .",
    "we find that these superhorizon modes re - assemble into an effective zero mode and unambiguously identify the composite operator that can be used as an effective expectation value of the inflaton field whose _ classical _ dynamics drives the evolution of the scale factor .",
    "this identification also provides the initial condition for this effective zero mode .    if the model allows many more than 60 e - folds we provide a criterion that allows the identification of the small perturbations that give rise to scalar metric ( curvature ) perturbations .",
    "we then use this criterion combined with the gauge invariant approach to obtain the spectrum for scalar perturbations .",
    "we find the index to be less than one , providing more power at long wavelength as a result of the spinodal instabilities .",
    "we argue that this ` red ' spectrum is a robust feature of potentials that lead to spinodal instabilities in the region in field space associated with inflation .",
    "finally we made contact with the reconstruction program and validated the results for these type of models based on the slow - roll assumption , despite the fact that our study does not involve such an approximation . a more detailed version of this article with a discussion of the issue of decoherence is forthcoming@xcite .",
