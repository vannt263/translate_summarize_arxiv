    "a universal scaling limit of random planar maps has recently been identified by le gall  @xcite ( triangulations and @xmath2-angulations , @xmath3 ) and miermont  @xcite ( quadrangulations ) as a random geodesic metric space called the _ brownian map _ @xmath4 . in this work ,",
    "we establish properties of the brownian map which are a step towards a complete understanding of its geodesic structure .",
    "the works of cori and vauquelin  @xcite and schaeffer  @xcite describe a bijection from well - labelled plane trees to rooted planar maps .",
    "the brownian map is obtained as a quotient of aldous  @xcite _ continuum random tree _ , or crt , by assigning brownian labels to the crt and then identifying some of its non - cut - points , or _ leaves _ , according to a continuum analogue of the _ cvs - bijection _",
    "( see section  [ s_bm ] ) .",
    "the resulting object is homeomorphic to the sphere @xmath5 ( le gall and paulin  @xcite and miermont  @xcite ) and of hausdorff dimension 4 ( le gall  @xcite ) and is thus in a sense a random , fractal , spherical surface .",
    "le gall  @xcite classifies the geodesics to the root , which is a certain distinguished point of the brownian map ( see section  [ s_bm ] ) , in terms of the label process on the crt ( see section  [ s_simple ] ) .",
    "moreover , the brownian map is shown to be invariant in distribution under uniform re - rooting from the volume measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 ( see section [ s_bm ] ) .",
    "hence , geodesics to typical points exhibit a similar structure as those to the root .",
    "it thus remains to investigate geodesics from special points of the brownian map .",
    "a striking consequence of le gall s description of geodesics to the root is that any two such geodesics are bound to meet and then coalesce before reaching the root , a phenomenon referred to as the _ confluence of geodesics _ ( see section  [ s_at ] ) .",
    "in fact , the set of points in the relative interior of a geodesic to the root is a small subset which is homeomorphic to an @xmath8-tree and of hausdorff dimension 1 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we call a subset @xmath9 a _ geodesic segment _ if @xmath10 is isometric to a compact interval",
    ". the _ extremities _ of the geodesic segment are the images , say @xmath11 and @xmath12 , of the extremities of the source interval , and we say that @xmath13 is a geodesic segment between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( or from @xmath11 to @xmath12 if we insist on distinguishing one orientation of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we will often denote a particular geodesic segment between @xmath14 as @xmath15 $ ] , and denote its relative interior by @xmath16-\\{x , y\\}$ ] .",
    "( since there might be more than one such geodesic segment , we will be careful in lifting any ambiguity that might arise from this notation . )",
    "we define @xmath17 and @xmath18 $ ] similarly .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "the _ geodesic net _ of @xmath11 , denoted @xmath20 , is the set of points @xmath21 that are contained in the relative interior of a geodesic segment to @xmath11 .",
    "although geodesics to the root of the brownian map are understood , the structure of geodesics to general points remains largely mysterious .",
    "indeed , the main obstacle in establishing the existence of the brownian map is to relate a geodesic between a pair of typical points to geodesics to the root .",
    "a compactness argument of le gall  @xcite yields scaling limits of planar maps along subsequences , however the question of uniqueness remained unresolved for some time .",
    "finally , making use of le gall s description of geodesics to the root , le gall  @xcite and miermont  @xcite show that distances to the root provide enough information to characterize the brownian map metric .",
    "let @xmath13 be a geodesic between points selected uniformly according to @xmath22 .",
    "( by the confluence of geodesics phenomenon , the root of the map is almost surely disjoint from @xmath13 . ) in  @xcite the set of points @xmath23 such that the relative interior of any geodesic from @xmath24 to the root is disjoint from @xmath13 is shown to be small compared to @xmath13 .",
    "hence , roughly speaking , `` most '' points in `` most '' geodesics of the brownian map are in a geodesic to the root .",
    "( see the discussion around equation ( 2 ) in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) for precise statements . )    in this work , we show that for _ any _ two points @xmath14 , points which are in a geodesic to @xmath11 but not in a geodesic to @xmath12 are exceptional .",
    "hence , to a considerable extent , the geodesic structure of the brownian map is similar as viewed from any point of the map , providing further evidence that it is , to quote le gall  @xcite , `` very regular in its irregularity . ''",
    "[ t_net - nwd ] almost surely , for all @xmath14 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 coincide outside a closed , nowhere dense set of zero @xmath22-measure .",
    "furthermore , for most points @xmath19 , the effect of small perturbations of @xmath11 on @xmath20 is localized .",
    "[ t_net - cts ] almost surely , the function @xmath26 is continuous almost everywhere in the following sense .    for @xmath6-almost",
    "every @xmath19 , for any neighbourhood @xmath27 of @xmath11 , there is a sub - neighbourhood @xmath28 so that @xmath29 is the same for all @xmath30 .",
    "the _ uniform infinite planar triangulation _ , or uipt , introduced by angel and schramm  @xcite , is a random lattice which arises as the _ local limit _ of random triangulations of the sphere .",
    "the case of quadrangulations , giving rise to the uipq , is due to krikun  @xcite .",
    "we remark that theorem  [ t_net - cts ] is in a sense a continuum analogue to a result of krikun  @xcite ( see also curien , mnard , and miermont  @xcite ) which shows that the `` schaeffer s tree '' of the uipq only changes locally after relocating its root .",
    "next , we find that the union of all geodesic nets is relatively small .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the set of points in the relative interior of a geodesic in @xmath4 .",
    "we refer to @xmath32 as the _ geodesic framework _ and @xmath33 as the _ endpoints of the brownian map_.    [ t_frame ] almost surely , the geodesic framework of the brownian map , @xmath34 , is of first baire category .",
    "hence , the endpoints of the brownian map , @xmath35 , is a residual subset .",
    "this property of the brownian map is reminiscent of a result of zamfirescu  @xcite , which states that for most convex surfaces  that is , for all surfaces in a residual subset of the baire space of convex surfaces in @xmath36 endowed with the hausdorff metric  the endpoints form a residual set .      recall that the cut locus of a point @xmath37 in a riemannian manifold  first examined by poincar  @xcite  is the set of points @xmath38 which are endpoints of maximal ( minimizing ) geodesics from @xmath37 .",
    "this collection of points is more subtle than merely the set of points with multiple geodesics to @xmath37 , and in fact , is generally the closure thereof ( see klingenberg  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1.14 ) ) .    in the brownian map",
    "this equivalence breaks completely .",
    "indeed , almost all ( in the sense of volume , by the confluence of geodesics phenomenon and invariance under re - rooting ) and most ( in the sense of baire category , by theorem  [ t_frame ] ) points are the end of a maximal geodesic , and every point is joined by multiple geodesics to a dense set of points ( see the note after the proof of proposition  [ p_mul ] ) . moreover , whereas in the brownian map there are points with multiple geodesics to the root which coalesce before reaching the root , in a riemannian manifold any ( minimizing ) geodesic which is not the unique geodesic between its endpoints can not be extended ( see , for example , the `` short - cut principle '' discussed in shiohama , shioya and tanaka  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  1.8.1 ) ) .",
    "we introduce the following notions of cut locus for the brownian map .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "the _ weak cut locus _ of @xmath11 , denoted @xmath40 , is the set of points @xmath21 with multiple geodesics to @xmath11 .",
    "the _ strong cut locus _ of @xmath11 , denoted @xmath41 , is the set of points @xmath21 to which there are at least two geodesics from @xmath11 that are disjoint in a neighbourhood of @xmath12 .",
    "we will see that for most points @xmath11 , it holds that @xmath42 ( proposition [ p_s = c ] ) .",
    "however , in some sense , @xmath41 is better - behaved than @xmath40 for the remaining exceptional points , and we will argue in section  [ s_cut - pf ] below that @xmath41 is more effective at capturing the essence of a cut - locus for the metric space @xmath43 .    the construction of the brownian map as a quotient of the crt gives a natural mapping from the crt to the map .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the root of the map .",
    "cut - points of the crt correspond to a dense subset @xmath45 of hausdorff dimension 2 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "le gall s description of geodesics reveals that @xmath46 is almost surely exactly the set of points with multiple geodesics to @xmath44 ( see section  [ s_simple ] ) .",
    "more specifically , for any @xmath21 , the number of connected components of @xmath47 is precisely the number of geodesics from @xmath12 to @xmath44 .",
    "this is similar to the case of a complete , analytic riemannian surface homeomorphic to the sphere ( see poincar  @xcite and myers  @xcite ) where the cut locus @xmath48 of a point @xmath11 is a tree and the number of `` branches '' emanating from a point in @xmath48 is exactly the number of geodesics to @xmath11 .    since the strong cut locus of the root of the brownian map corresponds to the crt minus its leaves",
    " that is , almost surely @xmath49 , where @xmath44 is the root ( see section  [ s_simple ] )  it is a fundamental subset of the map .",
    "we obtain analogues of theorems  [ t_net - nwd],[t_net - cts ] for the strong cut locus .",
    "[ t_cut - nwd ] almost surely , for all @xmath14 , @xmath41 and @xmath50 coincide outside a closed , nowhere dense set of zero @xmath22-measure .",

    "every @xmath19 , for any neighbourhood @xmath27 of @xmath11 , there is a sub - neighbourhood @xmath28 so that @xmath52 is the same for all @xmath30 .",
    "theorem  [ t_cut - cts ] brings to mind the results of buchner  @xcite and wall  @xcite , which show that the cut locus of a fixed point in a compact manifold is continuously stable under perturbations of the metric on an open , dense subset of its riemannian metrics ( endowed with the whitney topology ) .    as for the geodesic nets in theorem  [ t_frame ] ,",
    "we show that the union of all strong cut loci is a small subset of the map .",
    "[ t_locus ] almost surely , @xmath53 is of first baire category .",
    "we remark that gruber  @xcite ( see also zamfirescu  @xcite ) shows that for most ( in the sense of baire category ) convex surfaces @xmath54 , for any point @xmath55 , the set of points with multiple geodesics to @xmath11 is of first baire category .",
    "since for typical points @xmath19 , @xmath41 is exactly the set of points with multiple geodesics to @xmath11 ( that is , @xmath56 , see proposition  [ p_s = c ] ) , theorem  [ t_locus ] shows that this property holds almost surely for almost every point of the brownian map .",
    "that being said , there is a dense set of atypical points @xmath57 such that every @xmath58 is connected to _ all _ points outside a small neighbourhood of @xmath11 by multiple geodesics ( see proposition  [ p_mul ] ) .",
    "next , we investigate the structure of geodesic segments between pairs of points in the brownian map .    for @xmath14 ,",
    "the _ geodesic network _ between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , denoted @xmath59 , is the set of points in some geodesic segment between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "geodesic networks with one endpoint being the root of the map ( or a typical point by invariance under re - rooting ) are well understood . as discussed in section  [ s_cut ] , for any @xmath21",
    ", the number of connected components in @xmath47 gives the number of geodesics from @xmath12 to @xmath44 .",
    "hence , by properties of the crt , almost surely there is a dense set with hausdorff dimension 2 of points with exactly two geodesics to the root ; a dense , countable set of points with exactly three geodesics to the root ; and no points connected to the root by more than three geodesics . by invariance under re - rooting , it follows that the set of pairs that are joined by multiple geodesics is a zero - volume subset of @xmath60 ( see also miermont  @xcite ) .",
    "hence the vast majority of networks in the brownian map consist of a single geodesic segment .",
    "furthermore , by le gall s description of geodesics to the root and invariance under re - rooting , geodesic segments from a typical point of the brownian map have a specific topological structure .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "let @xmath61 denote the open ball of radius @xmath62 centred at @xmath11 .",
    "we say that the ordered pair of distinct points @xmath63 is _ regular _ if any two distinct geodesic segments between @xmath11 and @xmath12 are disjoint inside , and coincide outside , a punctured ball centred at @xmath12 of radius less than @xmath64 .",
    "formally , if @xmath13 and @xmath65 are geodesic segments between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then there exists @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "for typical points @xmath11 , all pairs @xmath63 are regular ( see section  [ s_simple ] ) .",
    "we note that this notion is not symmetric , that is , @xmath63 being regular does not imply that @xmath69 is regular .",
    "in fact , observe that @xmath63 and @xmath69 are regular if and only if there is a unique geodesic from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",

    "hence , any points @xmath71 in the relative interior of @xmath13 are joined by a unique geodesic .",
    "consequently , any geodesic segment @xmath65 to @xmath11 that intersects the relative interior of @xmath13 at some point @xmath24 coalesces with @xmath13 from that point on , that is , @xmath72 .",
