    "the properties of the fluctuations and correlations in spatially extended patterns out of thermodynamical equilibrium were studied long ago in the context of hydrodynamic systems @xcite .",
    "more recently there has been a new surge of interest in the field of nonlinear and quantum optics since lugiato and castelli pointed out the existence of a purely quantum phenomenon in a spatial stationary dissipative structure @xcite , the reduction of fluctuations below quantum limits in the difference between the intensities of the two fourier modes of a stripe pattern . since then , the properties of the fluctuations and correlations of stripe patterns in different nonlinear optical models have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "stripe patterns in these systems appear as supercritical transitions , and close to the threshold for pattern formation the harmonics of the fundamental wave vectors can be neglected . therefore considering the homogeneous mode and",
    "the two modes of the stripes for each field is enough and simplifies the problem allowing for an analytic treatment .",
    "the problem considering the whole infinite set of transverse modes in optical stripe patterns has been addressed numerically in @xcite . at difference with the few modes approximation ,",
    "the continuous problem makes evident the role of the so called soft modes in the fluctuations of the near field .",
    "however a very good agreement between the few modes approximation and the continuous treatment is still found for the correlations of the fluctuations of the far field mode intensities close to threshold .    due to the additional complexity",
    ", fluctuations and correlations in hexagonal optical patterns have been much less studied @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these two papers use an approximation in few modes to describe the pattern . however hexagonal patterns generally appear sub - critically , with a finite amplitude and therefore harmonics are not negligible even at threshold . strictly speaking , an approximation in which only the homogeneous mode plus the six modes of the hexagons are considered is not fully justified .    in this paper",
    "we will treat the case of a subcritical hexagonal pattern using a continuous model , i.e. , avoiding any restriction to a reduced number of spatial modes .",
    "in particular , we consider an optical cavity filled with a nonlinear isotropic kerr medium .",
    "this situation is described by the lugiato - lefever model @xcite in which a turing instability was described for the self - focusing case .",
    "this pattern - forming instability leads to a hexagonal pattern in the 2d transverse plane .",
    "we find that the fluctuation of the near field are dominated by the two goldstone modes associated to the translational invariance in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions , and by the soft modes arbitrarily close to them in infinitely large systems .",
    "we also show that the modes that dominate the near - field fluctuations do not contribute at all to the far - field intensity fluctuations .",
    "we identify the modes responsible for the far - field intensity correlations and we find : ( a ) strong correlations between arbitrary pairs of wave vectors of the pattern , but stronger between those forming a @xmath0 angle ; ( b ) anti - correlation between the zero wave vector of the spectrum of fluctuations and any wave vector of the pattern .",
    "while the anti - correlation of the homogeneous mode with the off - axis wave vectors can be understood in terms of energy conservations , the common microscopic interpretation of the far - field intensity correlations in terms of emission of twin photons would naively suggest that the strongest correlation is between the wave vectors forming a @xmath1 angle .",
    "in fact , the total transverse momentum conservation involve always at least four modes simultaneously and give some hints about how the correlations should be , but does not identifies the pairs with stronger correlations .",
