    "the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) is an optically selected galaxy redshift survey which extends to a redshift of 0.2 and which is composed of a total of 6 alternating @xmath10 slices , 3 each in the north and south galactic caps .",
    "now completed , the lcrs contains 26,418 galaxy redshifts , of which 23,697 lie within the official geometric and photometric limits of the survey .",
    "accurate @xmath7-band photometry and sky positions for program objects were extracted from ccd drift scans obtained on the las campanas swope 1-m telescope ; spectroscopy was performed at the las campanas du pont 2.5-m telescope , originally via a 50-fiber multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) , and later via a 112-fiber mos . for observing efficiency ,",
    "all the fibers were used , but each mos field was observed only once .",
    "hence , the lcrs is a collection of 50-fiber fields ( with nominal apparent magnitude limits of @xmath11 ) and 112-fiber fields ( with nominal apparent magnitude limits of @xmath12 ) ; see * figure  1*. thus , selection criteria vary from field to field , but these selection criteria are carefully documented and therefore easily taken into account . observing each field only once , however , created an additional selection effect : the protective tubing of the individual fibers prevented the spectroscopic observation of both members of galaxy pairs within 55  arcsec of each other .",
    "hence , groups and clusters can be undersampled , potentially causing physical groups to be split by a `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithm and resulting in the mis - estimate of general group properties .",
    "we will return to this problem in the next section .",
    "in constructing the lcrs group catalogue , we have considered only those lcrs galaxies within the official geometric and photometric borders of the survey ; we have furthermore limited this sample to galaxies having redshifts in the range @xmath13 and luminosities in the range @xmath14 ( see * figure  2 * ) .",
    "moreover , each of the @xmath15 galaxies which were excluded from lcrs redshift catalogue due to the fiber - separation effect has been re - introduced into the sample by assigning it a redshift equal to the redshift of its nearest neighbor convolved with a gaussian of width @xmath16  km  s@xmath2 ( roughly the mean line - of - sight velocity dispersion of a cleaned lcrs group sample which excludes these 55-arcsec `` orphans '' ) .",
    "the re - included galaxies subscribe to all the same limits imposed upon the original sample .",
    "the group catalogue was extracted using a standard `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithm ( huchra & geller 1982 ) modified for comoving distances and for field - to - field sampling variations . to take into account the latter , the projected separation and velocity difference linking parameters ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , were scaled according to the following equations ( which assure that the ratio @xmath19 is independent of environment ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , for a given fiducial field at at given fiducial redshift , and where @xmath23 is a linking scale which takes into account variations in galaxy sampling rate .",
    "it is defined by @xmath24^{-1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the number density of galaxies one would expect to observe at redshift @xmath26 in field @xmath27 for a homogeneous sample having the same selection function and sampling fraction as the lcrs redshift catalogue ; @xmath28 is @xmath29 for a given fiducial field at a given fiducial redshift . due to the simple field characteristics , we have chosen the fiducial field to have 100% sampling , flux limits of @xmath30 , and the same luminosity function as the lcrs northern 112-fiber sample ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) ; since it is roughly the median redshift of the survey , we have chosen the fiducial redshift @xmath31 to be 30,000  km  s@xmath2 .    finally , to avoid group - member incompleteness at the extremal distances of the sample",
    ", only groups within @xmath32 were admitted into the final group catalogue .",
    "the full catalogue contains 1495 groups and includes 35% of the lcrs galaxy sample ( * figures  3 * and * 4 * ) .",
    "a statistical sample of 394 groups was extracted from the full sample by culling groups which either were too close to a slice edge , had a crossing time greater than a hubble time , had a corrected velocity dispersion of zero or less , or contained a 55  arcsec `` orphan '' .",
    "some of the characteristics of the statistical sample are listed in * table i * , including medians of the following group properties :    * the group line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath33 , corrected for relativistic effects ( harrision 1974 ) and for estimated random errors in the lcrs redshifts . * the mean pairwise separation ,",
    "@xmath34 \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the comoving distance to the group , @xmath36 is the angular separation between group members @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the respective weights for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath41^{-1}\\ ] ] this weighting factor helps to counteract a bias resulting from a group straddling two fields with different galaxy sampling characteristics . * the harmonic radius , @xmath42^{-1 }   \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] * the crossing time for the group , @xmath43 in units of the hubble time ( @xmath44 ) . *",
    "the group s virial mass , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the gravitational constant . * the total group luminosity in the lcrs @xmath7-band , @xmath47 , corrected via the selection function to account for galaxies not observed by the lcrs .",
    "* the group mass - to - light ratio in the lcrs @xmath7-band , @xmath48 .",
    "the above definitions are very similar to those used by ramella , geller , & huchra ( 1989 ) , but modified to take into account cosmological effects ( due to the lcrs sample depth ) and field - to - field sampling variations .",
    "* table i * lists the properties of lcrs groups from the whole statistical sample , of those groups from just the 50-fiber fields , of those groups from just the 112-fiber fields , and of those groups which straddle the border of a 50-fiber and a 112-fiber field ; also tabulated are the general properties from an earlier incarnation of the lcrs @xmath49 group catalogue [ tucker 1994 ( t94 ) ] .",
    "the 50-fiber - field groups appear to be typically a little larger than the 112-fiber - field groups in both projected size ( @xmath50 & @xmath51 ) and velocity extent ( @xmath52 ) , indicating that the _ effective _ linking scale for the 50-fiber fields may be systematically larger than that for the 112-fiber fields , in spite of efforts to avoid such a bias . on the other hand ,",
    "much of the apparent divergence of the 50/112 group properties can be attributed to this sample s aberrantly high median velocity dispersion ( e.g. , recall @xmath53 ) , which in turn may be due to the small size of the 50/112 statistical sample or to the difficulties of properly extracting groups which straddle the border between a 50-fiber and a 112-fiber field .    finally , for comparison",
    ", we have also listed in * table i * the median group properties from several other group catalogues .",
    "these include those based upon the the original cfa redshift survey [ cfa1 ; nolthenius & white 1987 ( nw87 ) ; noltenius 1993 ( n93 ) ; moore , frenk , & white 1993 ( mfw93 ) ] , the southern sky redshift survey [ ssrs ; maia , da  costa , & latham 1989 ( mdcl89 ) ] , and the cfa extension to @xmath54 [ cfa2 ; ramella , geller , & huchra 1989 ( rgh89 ) ; ramella , pisani , & geller 1997 ( rpg97 ) ] .",
