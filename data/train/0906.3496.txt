    "a common feature of spatially extended systems that are driven far - from - equilibrium is spatiotemporal chaos where the dynamics are aperiodic in space and time  @xcite .",
    "important examples include the dynamics of the atmosphere and climate  @xcite ; fluid convection  @xcite ; the convection of biological organisms in the oceans  @xcite , the transition to chaos in excitable media  @xcite ; and the complicated dynamics of systems of reacting , advecting and diffusing chemicals  @xcite . despite intense theoretical and experimental investigation",
    "many important challenges remain regarding how to characterize , control , and predict the dynamics of these large complex systems .",
    "a unifying feature of many of these systems is that the dimension of the attractors describing their dynamics in phase space is very large .",
    "this severely limits the use of sophisticated techniques of chaotic time - series analysis  @xcite and of powerful geometry based descriptions of dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the use of lyapunov exponents to compute the fractal dimension does not suffer from these limitations and provides an important window into fundamental aspects of the dynamics of high dimensional chaotic systems .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of lyapunov exponents are inaccessible to experimental measurement using currently available techniques which leaves their numerical computation as an important way to gain new insights .",
    "a physical understanding of the dimension and how it varies with system parameters can provide fundamental knowledge regarding the underlying nature of spatiotemporal chaos that can be used to guide the development of improved theoretical descriptions for experimentally accessible systems .",
    "a defining feature of chaos is the sensitive dependence of the system dynamics on initial conditions and the exponential separation of nearby trajectories in phase space  @xcite .",
    "the rate of separation is quantified by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents @xmath0 where @xmath1 with @xmath0 arranged in descending order and @xmath2 is the total number of degrees of freedom in the system . for partial differential equations , although the phase space is infinite , the value of @xmath2 is expected to be very large but finite corresponding to the dimension of the inertial manifold ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . for a system of coupled ordinary differential equations , as we study here , the value of @xmath2 is equal to the number of independent variables .",
    "the summation of the first @xmath3 exponents ( where @xmath4 ) describes the growth of an @xmath3-dimensional ball of initial conditions in @xmath2-dimensional phase space .",
    "the exact interpolated number of exponents required for the sum to vanish is the dimension of the ball that will neither grow nor shrink and is an estimate of the fractal dimension @xmath5 of the strange attractor . using a linear interpolation yields the well known kaplan - yorke formula @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the largest integer such that the sum of the first @xmath7 lyapunov exponents is non - negative  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath5 is an approximate value of the number of degrees of freedom acting in the system  @xcite .",

    "more precisely , @xmath5 increases linearly with the volume of the system @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a characteristic length and @xmath10 is the number of spatially extended dimensions .",
    "the extensivity of @xmath5 is a consequence of spatial disorder .",
    "if two subsystems are sufficiently far apart their coupling is weak and they contribute independently and additively to the overall dimension  @xcite .",
    "cross and hohenberg  @xcite used this to define a natural chaotic length scale as @xmath11 where a volume @xmath12 will contain , on average , one degree of freedom .    using the above arguments",
    ", one intriguing possibility is that underlying spatiotemporal chaos are structures of volume @xmath13 .",
    "this raises an interesting question : how does the dimension vary for changes in system volume that are smaller than @xmath12 ?",
    "one possibility is that @xmath5 is proportional to the system size only on average . in this case",
    ", the variation of @xmath5 would have a stepwise structure with system size where the steps correspond to the addition of new degrees of freedom as the system grows large enough to accommodate them .",
    "a smoother transition may also be possible where the new degrees of freedom are able to stretch or compress to match the system size . in light of this , the variation of @xmath5 for small changes in system size can shed important physical insight upon the basic nature and composition of spatiotemporal chaos  ( c.f .",

    "extensive chaos was found in large periodic boxes  @xcite and in finite cylindrical domains  @xcite yielding a natural chaotic length scale @xmath15 corresponding approximately to the width of a convection roll pair",
    ". however , such calculations are very expensive and it remains unclear if a fluid system such as rayleigh - bnard convection is microextensive .    the approach we take is to study the dynamics of a periodic lattice of coupled variables ( discrete in space and continuous in time ) whose equations of motion were originally developed by edward lorenz in 1996 with the dynamics of the atmosphere and fluid convection in mind  @xcite .",

    "the lorenz-96 model is a simple model developed by edward lorenz in 1996 to study difficult questions regarding predictability in weather forecasting  @xcite .",

    "the discrete variables are coupled spatially and their equation of motion includes contributions relevant to fluid systems including a quadratic nonlinearity , dissipation , and a constant external forcing .",
