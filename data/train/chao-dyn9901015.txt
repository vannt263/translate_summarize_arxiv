    "zaslavskii _ et al _ @xcite studied the behavior of particles in the wave packet of an electric field in the presence of a static magnetic field . for a broad wave packet with sufficiently uniform spectrum",
    ", one may show that the problem can be stated in terms of an electrically kicked harmonic oscillator . for rational ratios between the frequency of the kicking field and larmor frequency associated with the magnetic field",
    "the phase space of the system is covered by a mesh of finite thickness ; inside the filaments of the mesh , the dynamics of the particle is stochastic and outside ( in the cells of stability ) , the dynamics is regular .",
    "this structure is called a stochastic web .",
    "it was found that this pattern covers the entire phase plane , permitting the particle to diffuse arbitrarily far into the region of high energies ( a process analogous to arnold diffusion @xcite ) .",
    "since the stochastic web leads to unbounded energies , several authors have considered the corresponding relativistic problem .",
    "longcope and sudan @xcite studied this system ( in effectively @xmath0 dimensions ) and found that for initial conditions close to the origin of the phase space there is a stochastic web , which is bounded in energy , of a form quite similar , in the neighborhood of the origin , to the non - relativistic case treated by zaslavskii _",
    "et al_. karimabadi and angelopoulos @xcite studied the case of an obliquely propagating wave , and showed that under certain conditions , particles can be accelerated to unlimited energy through an arnold diffusion in two dimensions . since an accelerated charged particle radiates , it is important to study the radiative corrections to this motion .",
    "we shall use the lorentz - dirac equation to compute this effect .",
    "we compute solutions to this equation for the case of the kicked oscillator . at low velocities , the stochastic web found by zaslavskii _",
    "et al_@xcite occurs ; the system diffuses in the stochastic region to unbounded energy , as found by karimabadi and angelopoulos@xcite .",
    "the velocity of the particle is light speed limited by the dynamical equations , in particular , by the suppression of the action of the electric field at velocities approaching the velocity of light @xcite .",
    "in the present study we will consider a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field , and kicked by an electric field .",
    "the effect of relativity , as well as the radiation of the particle , will be considered .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the `` on mass shell '' case .",
    "the fundamental equation that we use to study radiation is the lorentz - dirac equation @xcite , is @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( or 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , and the derivative is with respect to @xmath9 , which can be regarded as proper time in the `` on - mass - shell '' case .",
    "@xmath10 is the antisymmetric electromagnetic tensor . the first term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is the relativistic lorentz force , while the second term is the radiation - reaction term .",
    "note that the small size of the radiation coefficient ( @xmath11 ) leads to a singular equation that requires special mathematical treatment , as well as physical restrictions , as will be shown in the succeeding sections .",
    "following zaslavskii _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the magnetic field is chosen to be a uniform field in the @xmath8 direction , and the kicking electric field is a function of @xmath6 in the @xmath6 direction , @xmath12 originally , zaslavskii _ et al _ chose a uniform broad band electric field wave packet which can be expanded as an infinite sum of ( kicking ) @xmath13-functions ( @xmath14 is the frequency of the central harmonic of the wave packet , @xmath15 is the wave number of the central harmonic , and @xmath16 is the frequency between the harmonics of the wave packet ) @xmath17 which , for @xmath18 , becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",

    ", one has first to integrate over the @xmath13 electric kick and then to integrate the equations of motion between the kicks , where only a uniform magnetic field is present and there is no electric field up to the beginning of the next kick .",
    "in the case of a uniform magnetic field from eq .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) reduce to three coupled differential equations , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( charge of the electron ) .    using a complex coordinate@xcite , @xmath26 , eqs .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) can be written as , @xmath27 we wish here to constrain the radiatively perturbed motion to the `` mass shell '' ; to do this , it is very convenient to use hyperbolic coordinates , @xmath28 since the `` on mass shell '' restriction ( see @xcite for further discussion ) , @xmath29 is then automatically satisfied .",
    "the complex coordinate @xmath30 then becomes , @xmath31 and the equations of motion eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) can be written as , @xmath32 as pointed out earlier , in the case of a singular equation ( such as eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) ) , one has to consider physical arguments as well as mathematical arguments .",
    "there are several suggested methods to avoid the `` run away electron '' problem @xcite .",
    "one of the most frequently used , especially useful for scattering problems , assumes @xcite that the particle loses all its energy after a sufficiently large time , and the run away parts of the solution are set to zero ; the equations of motion can then be written as an integral equation .",
    "another method , which permits the study of problems with only non - asymptotic states @xcite , uses an iterative singular perturbation integration that leads to the stable solution . since the integration we must use is over a finite time , it is impossible to use an asymptotic condition ( e.g. @xmath33 at @xmath34 ) .",
    "the sokolov and ternov approach @xcite is more suitable for our purpose , since it can be implemented for bounded time integration , and the mathematical solution is simple . in this method , in the first step , the perturbation terms in eq .",

    "the solution is @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the actual ( normalized ) velocity , and @xmath38 is the decay time for the energy of the particle .    to get an estimate for the radiation during one cycle , we will refer to the maximal uniform magnetic field that can achieved today in a laboratory , which is in the laboratory . ] @xmath39 .",
    "if , for example , @xmath40 , then @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . thus , it is clear from eq .",

    "the time @xmath45 between the kicking is of the order of the period , the energy loss between consecutive kicks is very small . at much higher field strengths , a qualitatively different behavior may occur , for which the energy loss may be very high during a single cycle , and the resulting motion may be modified to reflect a nonrelativistic behavior , or it may entirely stop before the next kick . this behavior may result in a stochastic web of a somewhat different type .",
    "the time between the kicking is measured according to the observed time along the motion , @xmath46 .",

    "if the initial velocities are small , i.e. @xmath108 , the additional factor is close to 1 , and thus the structure of the web should not change . in the radiative and relativistic case , as well as the non - radiative relativistic case , conditions ( [ e42 ] ) and ( [ e43 ] )",
    "become , @xmath109 for sufficiently large initial velocities the above conditions do not hold anymore , and the web structure is not observed .    in this section",
    "we will compare ( qualitatively ; a quantitative treatment for the diffusions rate will be studied elsewhere ) the diffusion of the non - radiative particle and the radiative particle .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that a radiative particle will diffuse more slowly than a non - radiative one , since the radiation effects act like friction , and are thus expected to `` stop '' the particle . however , this naive explanation is not true , as we will demonstrate below .    in order to investigate the above assumption ,",
    "we have chosen a four symmetry structure ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we used the same initial conditions for all cases ; just the kicking strength @xmath110 has been changed .",
    "the initial conditions were @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and the number of iterations was @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the results as follows : the first column is the non - radiative case , the second column is the radiative case , and the third column is the total velocity versus the iteration number ( the circles indicates the non - radiative case and the squares the radiative one ) . in the first row @xmath116 , in the second @xmath117 , and in the third @xmath118 .    as can be seen clearly from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the web structure is valid for the radiative case ( top panel , first column ) .",
    "the web structure is also exists in the other cases ; the web cells are very small and they are difficult to see .",
    "although the radiative particle and the non - radiative particle start from the same initial conditions they behave differently .    in some cases the diffusion rate of the radiative case is larger then the diffusion rate of the non - radiative case , for example , in the top and the bottom panels after @xmath119 iterations the radiative particle reaches a higher velocity then the non - radiative one . on the other hand , in the middle panel",
    "the radiative particle is slower then non - radiative one .",

    "this would be beyond the scope of the present paper and will be considered elsewhere .    when the velocity of the particle reaches close to the velocity of light it actually stops growing ( according to evolution in the time @xmath5 ) although it increases its energy . in fig .",

    "in the present paper we have investigated the effect of radiation on the stochastic web . under the restriction of small magnetic fields ( @xmath128 )",
    "an iterative map was constructed .",
    "moreover , the effect of radiation on the stochastic web is very small because of the small magnetic field .",
    "qualitatively , the non - radiative and the radiative cases have similar web structure . despite of the naive expectation that the diffusion rate in the radiative case should be smaller then non - radiative case , one can find cases in which the opposite effect is observed .",
    "although it seems the effect of radiation is not qualitatively significant under laboratory conditions , it might have a strong effect in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "such a magnetic field could occur near or in a neuron star ( or other heavy stars ) and it can cause a large radiation correction to the motion of the particle . in that case",
    "one does not expect to have a web structure even when the particle has very small velocity , since the particle might move from the unstable fixed point and thus destroy the web structure . on the other hand ,",
    "another scenario can take place ; the magnetic field may be so strong that the particle almost stops its motion before the next kick , and under some symmetry conditions it can diffuse to the large energy regime .",
    "the described scheme can reflect new phenomenon not previously predicted , and could give some insight to the stellar systems .    in the present study we did not consider the radiation during the @xmath13 kick because of lack of proper technical methods as well as analytical knowledge .",
