    "the determination of the physical basis of the emergence of glassy relaxation when a liquid is supercooled under its melting point represents a subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "striking aspects of such behavior are the fact that the dynamic observables change dramatically with the supercooling ( while static quantities show at most very mild differences ) and that the dynamics varies by orders of magnitude from one region of the system to another @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these systems slows down very fast in this regime ( as temperature is reduced ) and the relaxation has been believed to proceed by means of cooperatively relaxing regions whose time scales and sizes grow considerably as the temperature is decreased @xcite .",
    "this heterogeneous scenario has been corroborated by the discovery , both experimentally and theoretically , of the existence of dynamical heterogeneities @xcite .",
    "some studies identified cooperative motions of a small number of particles ( a few percent ) which move collectively , often in a string - like fashion , by a distance close to the particle diameter @xcite .",
    "more recently , collective motions of a significant fraction of the particles of different regions of these systems which form relatively compact clusters have been found @xcite .",
    "these very rapid and sporadic events , which were termed `` democratic motions '' , drive the system from one metabasin ( mb ) of its potential energy surface , a group of similar closely related structures @xcite , to another while the structural relaxation ( the so - called @xmath0 relaxation ) is performed by a small number of such events . these relatively compact clusters (",
    "`` democratic '' clusters or d - clusters @xcite ) have been identified in different glassy systems like a binary lennard - jones system and supercooled water @xcite and represent natural candidates for the cooperatively relaxing regions proposed long ago by adam and gibbs @xcite . a recent inhomogeneous mode - coupling theory of dynamical heterogeneity",
    "has related them to the ( fractal ) geometrical structures carrying the dynamical correlations at timescales commensurable with that of the @xmath0 relaxation @xcite .",
    "additionally , a recent experimental and computational work in a glassy polymer provided experimental support to the mb - mb transitions and d - clusters @xcite .",
    "even when it would be intuitively expected that the dynamical heterogeneities are related to structural heterogeneities in the sample , the determination of the existence of a causal link between structure and dynamics remains as another main open problem in the field @xcite .",
    "a recent beautiful idea holds the promise to shed some light in this regard @xcite . by means of the isoconfigurational ensemble ( ic )",
    "it has been determined that the propensity of the particles ( their tendency to be mobile ) is in fact determined by the initial configuration of the sample and that the particles with the higher propensity are not homogeneously distributed within the sample but arranged in relatively compact clusters @xcite .",
    "the time extent of the influence of the local structure on the dynamics has also been shown to be on the order of the mb residence time , a timescale shorter than the @xmath1relaxation time ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . in a previous work",
    ", it has been shown for the binary lennard - jones system that the high propensity regions of a given initial configuration represent unblocked regions wherein d - clusters occur in the subsequent dynamics ( for any given isoconfigurational realization or trajectory initiated in such configuration ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to complete this picture by revealing the fact that not only the local structure constraints the resulting dynamics but to elucidate the role of the d - clusters in reformulating the spatial variation of propensity for motion , thus making evident the mutual transference of constraints between structure and dynamics . to this end , and by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the binary lennard - jones model we shall generate many ics at different times over a given trajectory ( thus determining the spatial distribution of propensity on configurations at different times of the trajectory ) and we shall show that at the times when the d - clusters occur the system shows the greater changes in propensity , thus producing a clear propensity de - correlation .",
    "we performed a series of md nve simulations for a widely used model of fragile glass former : the binary lennard - jones system consisting of a 3d mixture of 80 % @xmath3 and 20 % @xmath4 particles , the size of the @xmath3 particles being 47 % larger than the @xmath4 ones @xcite .",
    "we shall show results from systems at temperature @xmath5 , density of 1.2 and @xmath6 particles @xcite .",
    "this system size avoids the interference of results from many different subsystems ( metabasins ) while being free of finite size effects , as shown in ref .  .",
    "we have also simulated a large system ( @xmath7 particles ) which yielded an equivalent dynamical behavior ( however , in order to look for mbs and d - clusters , one has to study the behavior of subsystems of @xmath6 and thus , the large system should be decomposed in many small subsystems wherein to apply the concept of mb @xcite ) .",
    "given this fact , in the rest of this work we shall refer to a system of @xmath6 . at low temperatures ( close and above the critical temperature predicted by the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition , @xmath8 ) this system presents dynamical heterogeneities @xcite : a small number of particles move cooperatively a distance that is comparable to the inter - particle distance .",
    "these `` fast moving '' ( or `` mobile '' ) particles are not homogeneously distributed throughout the sample but are arranged in clusters usually made of string - like groups of particles @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is most heterogeneous at time @xmath9 defined by the maximum in the non - gaussian parameter @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which measures the deviation of the self part of the van hove function ( the probability at a given time of finding a particle at distance @xmath12 from its initial position ) from a brownian behavior @xcite .",
    "this quantity is located at the end of the @xmath13 - beginning of the @xmath0 relaxation ( the crossover from the caging to the diffusive regime in the mean - squared displacement @xmath14 plot ) and constitutes the characteristic time for dynamical heterogeneities ( in this case @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , @xmath9 depends strongly on temperature and grows quickly as we move towards @xmath17 @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath0 relaxation is driven by a series of a few mb - mb transitions which are triggered by the occurrence of large compact clusters of medium - range - mobility particles called democratic particles @xcite .",

    "we now describe briefly the distance - matrix method to study mb dynamics ( see refs .   for details )",
    ": we perform an md simulation and record equally - spaced configurations ( for example 101 configurations , as in refs .  ) for an @xmath0-relaxation total run time ( @xmath18 , thus consecutively recorded configurations are separated in time by @xmath19 % @xmath20 ) and build the following distance matrix @xcite , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the position of particle @xmath23 at time @xmath24 ( since @xmath25 this is a triangular matrix ) .",

    "thus , we used 150 particles .",
    "however , we also found the same qualitative results for small subsystems immersed in a big one , thus ruling out the possibility for finite size effects ( we repeated the study for subsystems of 150 particles within a large system of 8000 particles , that is , we focused only on a portion of the large system ) .     for @xmath5 .",

    ", we would expect a distance matrix with a dark main diagonal and a continuous fading as we move away from such diagonal .",
    "however , from the island structure of this matrix a clear mb structure of the landscape is evident .",
    "that is , islands are made up of closely related configurations ( low @xmath29 ) which are separated from the configurations of other islands by large distances .",
    "in other words , the dynamics of the system is inhomogeneous in time . we can estimate the typical residence time in the mbs for this @xmath30 ( from island sizes ) as qualitatively on the order of @xmath9 .",
    "given the small system size we expect this to be a good estimate ( however , this timescale clearly depends on system size , since for a large system different subsystems would be undergoing mb - mb - transition events at different times ) .",
    "thus , mb - mb transitions ( the crossings from one island to another and which last 10 % to 20 % of @xmath9 ) are fast events compared to the times for the exploration of the mbs .",
    "the study of mb - mb - transition events has been done previously @xcite , revealing the decisive role of large compact d - clusters of medium - range - mobility particles .",

    "@xmath24 are not uniform throughout the sample and high propensity particles are confined to certain ( relatively compact ) regions @xcite .",
    "thus , while particle mobility is not reproducible from run to run , the spatial variation in the propensity is completely determined by the initial configuration , reflecting the influence of structure on dynamics @xcite . while the mean value of the propensity [ @xmath55 depends on the length of the time interval in which it is calculated ( @xmath41 ) , the spatial variation of propensity does not depend on it for times not too small ( down to 10 % @xmath9 or even less ) @xcite .",
    "in other words , if one calculates the propensity at @xmath56 or higher ( of course that for very long times larger than @xmath2 when the system becomes diffusive , the propensity distribution gets uniform ) or if one does it for a timescale of 10 % @xmath9 , the particles with high and low propensity are the same in any case . in this work",
    "we chose a time @xmath57 % @xmath9 to calculate propensity since at this short time the ic trajectories do not have time to abandon the local mb ( perform a d - cluster ) and we can safely say that we are sampling the short - time vibrations ( without interference of the dynamics at larger times ) . a propensity much greater than the mean value , a great tendency to be mobile , is thus a clear indication that the particle is not `` comfortable '' in its actual position ,",
