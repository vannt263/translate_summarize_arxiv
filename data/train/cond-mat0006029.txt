    "quantum mechanics in an imaginary magnetic field ( imf ) has been studied by various authors , after hatano and nelson @xcite pointed out its relevance in describing the competition between drift and pinning for a vortex in the presence of columnar defects .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian with imf is a convection - diffusion operator ; operators of this type occur as well in models of driven population dynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . due to the convection term , parity is violated and the wave function is exponentially magnified along a given direction ; as a consequence , it can keep a localized character provided its decay , generated by the disordered potential , wins over the imf amplification .    in the zero - imf reference",
    "hamiltonian the decay , if disorder does not violate parity , is characterized by the inverse of a single localization length on both sides . with convection , when the decay is exactly compensated by the imf magnification factor , the wave function becomes delocalized .",
    "the spectrum at the critical point bifurcates , and is distributed along a d=1 curve in the complex plane . this scenario was proved to be valid with various potential distributions ( gaussian , box , cauchy ) ; it has been confirmed for lattice models with disordered hopping @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the hermitean case",
    ", one can turn the eigenvalue problem into a langevin equation , and determine the spectral properties @xcite from the steady state distribution of the langevin problem .    here",
    "we generalize this approach to complex - valued stochastic equations , as needed when dealing with non - hermitean hamiltonians .",
    "rather than starting with a gaussian @xmath0-correlated potential , which would lead to a langevin equation , we consider a piecewise constant potential @xmath1 , a model originally studied by benderskii and pastur @xcite in the hermitean case .",
    "the reasons for our choice will become clear in the sequel . if , e.g. , @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath1 describes equally engineered trapping defects in an homogeneous medium .",
    "we assume that free segments and trapping segments are independent random variables , with fixed average length @xmath5 respectively .",
    "although the stochastic equation is no longer of langevin type , the probability distribution still satisfies a differential equation .",
    "this equation allows for an adiabatic approach , which would be impossible with white noise .",
    "we can thus reduce the phase space to a one - dimensional attractor @xmath6 , strongly simplifying the search for steady state .",
    "the `` dynamic variable '' of the stochastic equation is the logarithmic derivative @xmath7 of the wave function . from the mean value @xmath8",
    "one extracts the inverse of the localization length , as well as a wavenumber .",
    "generically we find that the localization length decreases when @xmath9 departs from the real axis , and increases with @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior implies that , in the presence of an imf , at a critical value of @xmath10 the system delocalizes ; the contour lines of @xmath11 determine then the mobility edge in the complex energy plane .",
    "three different regimes ( low , high and intermediate @xmath10 ) will be analyzed in the next three sections .",
    "the eigenvalue problem @xmath12 for a d=1 hamiltonian @xmath13 with disordered potential @xmath1 translates into a langevin equation for the logarithmic derivative @xmath14 of the wave function @xmath15 : @xmath16 as is well known , one can limit the analysis to real - valued wave functions .",
    "the deterministic part of the equation is invariant under space inversion @xmath17 ; hence , if the statistical properties of @xmath1 are also invariant , the backward and forward @xmath18-evolution of @xmath14 are equivalent , i.e. they approach the same steady state .",
    "one defines the lyapunov exponent @xmath19 : @xmath20 where the average is over @xmath1 ; @xmath21 is always positive for disordered potentials with rapidly decaying correlations @xcite .",

    "consistently , one has indeed @xmath24 and a non - even steady state distribution @xmath25 .",
    "let us now examine how this picture is changed upon adding an external ( constant ) imaginary magnetic field ( imf ) . in the hamiltonian ,",
    "this is mimicked by : @xmath26 , implying @xmath27 in eq .",

    "[ a1 ] is restored , but the boundary conditions are changed : e.g. , in the case of a double - sided problem , from @xmath35 , one has @xmath36 .",
    "we are not going to study the spectrum , but rather the vanishing of the `` effective '' lyapunov exponent @xmath37 . in order to do that it is sufficient to study the steady state distribution @xmath38 of eq . [ a1 ] with @xmath39 ,",
    "obtain @xmath40 and from it the contour lines of @xmath11 .",
    "notice that from the analysis a new object emerges , @xmath41 , a sort of wavenumber of delocalized solutions .    in the search for steady state",
    ", we adopt an adiabatic approach .",
    "this is possible with our model potential , due to a property of eq .",
    "[ a1 ] with @xmath42 .",
    "let us discuss this property first .",
    "equation [ a1 ] has two time - independent solutions ( respectively stable and unstable critical point ) . if we denote with @xmath43 one of the square roots of @xmath9 , the critical points are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , ( the suffixes @xmath46 meaning stable and unstable respectively , with @xmath47 ) .",
    "it is easily verified that the equation can be explicitly solved , for arbitrary initial conditions . after some algebra one obtains the announced property : the solutions satisfy an exact relation of the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants .    as a model potential ,",
    "we take @xmath1 two - valued , piecewise constant , @xmath52 .",
    "the lengths of the @xmath53 intervals are two independent random variables with distributions @xmath54 .    in order to write the analog of equation [ a1 ] ,",
    "we first introduce an independent stochastic variable @xmath55 , which assumes the values @xmath56 with distributions @xmath57 .",
    "the probability @xmath58 of @xmath55 satisfies the rate equation : @xmath59 since @xmath55 stays on the l - th channel an average `` time''@xmath60 .",
    "the equation we looked for is then : @xmath61 and , in components : @xmath62 as is well known , from eq.[a1 ] , if @xmath1 is gaussian , one gets a fokker - plank equation for the probability .",
    "equation [ a3 ] is no longer of langevin type , but one can show that the probability distribution still satisfies a differential equation .",
    "the details of the derivation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the original paper @xcite . in terms of the probability @xmath63 one has : @xmath64 we finally state our adiabatic approximation .",
    "we assume that the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 are very small with respect to the characteristic `` frequencies '' of the two deterministic evolutions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively associated with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "such frequencies , as one easily realizes , are the square roots @xmath71 of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "let us examine the low @xmath10 case . in both deterministic systems",
    "we assume @xmath74 .",
    "this regime is out of the physical region since it implies @xmath75 ; in spite of that , its analysis will be found to be useful in the sequel .    upon averaging eq .",
    "[ a2 ] over the variable b , which is fast varying with respect to a when @xmath74 , the factor @xmath76 reduces to unity , and we obtain : @xmath77 when @xmath55 is kept constant .",
    "we now proceed to determine the steady state of eq .",
    "we first eliminate the @xmath78-dependence from @xmath79 and @xmath80 by means of eq .",
    "[ b1 ] , then average over @xmath78 , and obtain : @xmath81 here @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are averaged over @xmath78 .",
    "the sum of the two equations gives : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "it is readily verified that only with @xmath86 the positivity of the @xmath87 s is preserved .",
    "when @xmath88 is large enough the flow is in the negative @xmath89 direction on both channels ; it turns positive for @xmath90 respectively .",
    "let us assume , without loss of generality , @xmath91 .",
    "a simple inspection of the hopping between channels shows that the particle gets trapped in the interval @xmath92 ; the probability is zero outside .",
    "notice that upon including an indeterminacy in the radii of the two circular attractors we would get a non zero probability flow .",
    "apart from the normalization factor @xmath93 , the solutions have the form : @xmath94^{\\mu_{0 } } \\cdot \\big [ |{{z_{r } - \\epsilon^{(1)}_{i } }   \\over{z_{r } - \\epsilon^{(1)}_{i}}}|\\big]^{\\mu_{1}}\\\\ \\mu_{l } & = & { c_{l } \\over { 4 \\cdot \\epsilon^{(l)}_{i}}}\\nonumber\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath95 has an integrable power law singularity at the @xmath96-th channel s stable point , and a zero at the opposite channel s stable point .",
    "if we denote with @xmath97 and @xmath98 the integrals of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , they must satisfy the global equilibrium condition : @xmath101 we determined the solution in the region @xmath102 under this condition .",
    "the power exponent of the distribution is a function of the ratio @xmath103 , i.e. it is shaped by the average `` residence times '' over the two channels . the mean value @xmath104 is increasing with the ratio @xmath105 , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "since larger ratios imply larger values of @xmath106 , this simply means that the lyapunov exponent increases with disorder , as it should be .",
    "any boundary condition @xmath107 with @xmath108 lying outside the interval @xmath92 can not be fulfilled : the density of states must then be zero in this regime , as anticipated .",

    "[ a2 ] the variable a is now fast varying with respect to b. the average over a gives : @xmath111 from which : @xmath112 in a single channel , the metastable attractor is a couple of parallel lines : one through the stable , the other through the unstable critical point .",
    "furthermore , the lines are orthogonal to the segment connecting such points .",
    "it appears that , in going from the low to the high energy limit , the attractor undergoes dilatation in the direction of such lines .",
    "this effect can already be seen in fig.2 , referring to the low energy regime .",
    "an indeterminacy arises , about the line currently occupied by the `` particle '' : @xmath113 the single channel situation is illustrated in figs.3 and 4 , where we display the vector field and the probability distribution for eq .",

[ c11 ] ; the term is of the order @xmath119 .",
