    "recent publications @xcite on the theoretical description of spin waves in the hubbard - model demonstrate an increased interest in the subject .",
    "the hubbard - model , originally introduced in 1963 by hubbard and others @xcite , is one of the best investigated models in many - body - theory .",
    "it is commonly accepted to be the simplest model to hold for the itinerant as well as the localized character of the valence electrons in partially filled 3d - shells of transition and rare earth metals such as ni , fe , co. despite the continuing interest only a handful of exact statements can be given on the possibility of a ferromagnetic groundstate .",
    "actually the model appears not to be very convenient for ferromagnetism .",
    "the exact solution of the @xmath0 hubbard - model @xcite suggests the ground - state to be an antiferromagnetic one as well as the fact that in all dimensions the half - filled hubbard - model can be mapped onto the antiferromagnetic heisenberg - model in the strong coupling regime @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the bandwidth and @xmath3 the interaction strength .",
    "furthermore the mermin - wagner - theorem @xcite forbids the existence of magnetic long range order for @xmath4 at finite temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the zero - bandwidth limit excludes a ferromagnetic solution because @xmath6 is always valid @xcite , herein @xmath7 is the occupation number of @xmath8(@xmath9)-spin .    if at all , we expect a ferromagnetic phase to occur in the strong coupling regime @xmath1 , away from exact half - filling in @xmath10 .",
    "the simple hartree - fock approximation ( hf ) is able to deliver a ferromagnetic ground state in the hubbard - model as long as the interaction strength is sufficiently large or respectively the density of states at the fermi - surface @xmath11 is considerably high , manifested in the famous stoner - criterion @xmath12 .",
    "well known fact that hf - theory overestimates the existence of spontaneous ferromagnetism .",
    "in particular the curie - temperatures are orders of magnitude too high but nevertheless hf points in the right direction .",
    "a more sophisticated approach beside others is the spectral - density - ansatz ( sda ) @xcite based on harris s and lange s @xcite statements who have shown that the spectral density is dominated by two strongly developed peaks at the centre of the band @xmath13 and at @xmath14 when a finite hopping probability is taken into account .",
    "sda basically is a two - pole ansatz of the form @xmath15 , where the in the first place unknown parameters , spectral weights @xmath16 and peak positions @xmath17 , are fitted via the exactly calculable spectral moments @xcite .",
    "the sda - approximation results in a much more reliable phase - diagram and more trustworthy curie - temperatures than hf - approximation . in a single particle theory , however , collective excitations are not present .",
    "the study of these excitations in itinerant ferromagnets requires the examination of the transversal magnetic susceptibility .",
    "collective excitations have a strong influence on the stability of the ferromagnetic phase in particular at higher temperatures since the excitations of magnons tend to destroy the magnetic ordering .",
    "this is the reason for our interest in describing collective excitations in the hubbard - model .    facing the complexity of the many - body problem",
    "one usally has to apply one or more suitable and reasonable approximations in order to find physically interpretable results .",
    "certain sequences of such approximations will be presented in the following sections . in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we will develop the theory for the magnetic susceptibility which results in the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "rpa combines ladder - approximation of the two - particle green function with the hf - approximation of the one - particle green function and is discussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] we will combine ladder - approximation of the two - particle green function with the more sophisticated sda - approach of the one particle green function which makes a further approximation necessary , namely a screened interaction @xmath18 , but will result in physically reasonable behaviour of the collective mode .",
    "this is a new approach to the at the beginning mentioned spin wave problem and discussed in detail .",
    "we present our results in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec5 ] and discuss them with respect to results of different authors and will finally close with a short summary and an outlook in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec6 ] .",
    "we use the so - called one band hubbard - hamiltonian where orbital degrees of freedom are neglected for simplicity .",
    "it reads in second quantized form in fourier - space as @xmath19 the operators @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) in ( [ eq : hubbard_hamilton_k ] ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for fermions in @xmath22-space .",
    "spin waves are collective excitations of the solid s state electronic system .",
    "the group of conduction electrons take on a coherent quantum state which is described as a gapless excitation with energy @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the wavevector of a so - called spinwave .",
    "the spin wave dispersion usually behaves as @xmath25 for small @xmath26-values , where @xmath27 is the stiffness constant .    in order to describe the excited system",
    "we make use of the retarded polarisation propagator and will analyze it with help of a diagramatic technique . in our case",
    "the polarisation propagator is the transversal magnetic susceptibility .",
    "it is a two - particle green function and given in energy representation by @xmath28 where the spin - operators are @xmath29 within matsubara formalism @xcite , which is a generalisation of the green function formalism to the imaginary time scale , this two - particle quantity is given by @xmath30\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\hat{\\chi}^{+-}_{q}(e_n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time - ordering operator @xmath31 in ( [ eq : ru : g2 ] ) , for wich a generalized wick s theorem exists @xcite , sorts operators in a product of operators by their time - arguments .",
    "matsubara - frequencies , denoted by subscript @xmath32 , are given by @xmath33 one obtains the retarded form of ( [ eq : ru : g2 ] ) , the actual interesting quantity , simply by analytical continuation .",
    "the poles of ( [ eq : ru : g2 ] ) yield the spin wave excitation spectrum .",
    "diagramatically ( [ eq : ru : g2 ] ) is represented by the graph given on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : renorm ] . the representation with help of the vertex part ( shaded triangle on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : renorm ] ) is very handy because it allows an approximate partial summation .",
    "representation of the polarisation propagator with help of the vertex function ]    the vertex part plays a similar role as the selfenergy in a single particle theory .",
    "the doubly lined propagators on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : renorm ] indicate that we have to use the full single particle green function @xmath34 instead of the free green function @xmath35 indicated by singly lined propagators as on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : renorm ] .    for the vertex part we have to find a practicable and physically reasonable approximation . summing up the ladder graphs ( see fig .  [",

    "now , finding ( [ eq : lambda ] ) solves the problem .",
    "this task can be fullfilled by first rewriting ( [ eq : lambda ] ) with help of the spectral representation of the matsubara function , i.e. we use @xmath41 and write for @xmath40 : @xmath42 for technical reasons we introduce two other abbreviations namely , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "the polarisation propagator then becomes @xmath45 .",

    "we did not make any statement about the one - particle spectral densities in ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) . on account of the complexity of the many - body problem we have to apply a suitable approximation for the single particle spectral densities in ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) . in the following section we will do exactly this with the hf - approximation .",
    "evaluation of ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) requires a three - dimensional summation over wavevectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",

    "this is due to the fact that the expression @xmath66    where @xmath67    is true for any @xmath51-dependent function whose @xmath65-dependence is only given by a @xmath68-dependence .",
    "this procedure allows us to apply the numerical formulas given by jelitto @xcite for the bloch density of states ( bdos ) .",
    "picture [ fig : bdos ] shows the bdos for the fcc and bcc - lattice resulting from these formulas .",

    "useful is the following representation of the hf - spectral density @xmath73 the propagator ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) reduces with ( [ eq : hf_specdens ] ) and @xmath74 to @xmath75 for @xmath70 one easily can perform the summation over wave vectors because @xmath76 the condition for the denominator of ( [ eq : n_vert ] ) to be zero is @xmath77 or equivalently @xmath78 here @xmath79 denotes the magnetisation .",
    "one immediatly sees that this condition is fullfilled only for @xmath80 which means that using hf - theory a well defined gapless excitation exsists .",
    "edwards @xcite already stated that excited states with one reversed spin in bandferromagnets must have an energy of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a @xmath83-independent constant that contains the correlation energy .",
    "clearly in hf - theory this is the case . in the event of transitions between majority- and minority - spin band",
    "the excitation energy is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the rigid exchange splitting energy of the hf - theory .",
    "in this section we will use the sda - theory as the single particle input for the two particle propagator ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) .",
    "compared to hf - approximation sda is a real many - body theory able to deliver ferromagnetism in the hubbard - model and tested by means of comparison to different advanced many - body theories concerning ferromagnetism in the hubbard - model .",
    "comparison of sda , modified - alloy - analogy ( maa ) and modified - perturbation - theorie with the numerical exact quantum - monte - carlo - simulation@xcite indicates that the qualitative behaviour of the sda phase - diagram is correctly displayed .",
    "furthermore are the curie - temperatures orders of magnitude lower than in hf - theory and therefore much more reliable .",
    "hf - theory overestimates the occurence of ferromagnetism in the hubbard - model , although the tendency is right , in a incredulous manner .    though one can not simply check the validity of the theory by putting the sda - selfenergy ( or equivalently the spectral density ) for @xmath70 into the expression ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) because the selfenergy in sda consists of a stoner or hf - like part and a spin dependent rest",
    "this spin - dependence prevents us from being able to check the validity in a similar manner as with hf - theory .",
    "@xmath86    the spin dependence of the second term of ( [ eq : sda_selbstenergie ] ) is mainly given by the so called band shift @xmath87 .",
    "this spin - dependence in sda - theory is the main improvement and leads to a shift of @xmath8- and @xmath9-quasipartical - density of states ( qdos ) , for further details on the sda see @xcite .",
    "however , the similarity of ( [ eq : sda_selbstenergie ] ) to the stoner self energy let us hope that connecting sda with ladder approximation could work out and might even hold an improvement .",
    "but numerical evaluation of ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) using sda - theory as input in form of a sum of weighted @xmath88-functions shows negative excitation energies which are unphysical .    with no apparent reason both approximations , the ladder approximation for the two - particle propagator and the sda for the single particle propagator are not fully compatible .",
    "the idea now was to introduce an effective coulomb interaction @xmath18 in order to replace the hubbard - u in ( [ eq : n_vert ] ) and hopefully be able to shift the negative excitation energies to the right energetic position .",
    "this was done numerically via the condition @xmath89 indeed , replacing the hubbard-@xmath3 in the polarisation propagator ( [ eq : n_vert ] ) with @xmath18 given by the above condition the unphysical behaviour could be repaired .",
    "the susceptibility ( [ eq : n_vert ] ) now is to look at as @xmath90 the term @xmath91 in ( [ eq : mrpa ] ) is ( [ eq : zwrgbns ] ) with the appropriate input of the sda - single particle density of states .",
    "the introduction of the effective or screened interaction of course is to rate as yet another approximation .",
    "but the interaction in a two particle theory not necessarily has to be the same as the interaction in a single particle theory .",
    "it is the essence of a two particle theory to take additional correlations into account .",
    "hf - theory for instance neglects the correlation between particles of opposite spin .",
    "this can be seen by the diagramatical representation of the self - energy in hf - theory , where the exchange - interaction part does not contribute to the self - energy .",
    "the only contribution to the hf - self - energy comes from the direct coulomb - term , wich describes the interaction of an electron with an effective field caused by the other particles in the system .",
    "the contribution coming from the exchange - interaction , however , is taken into account in ladder approximation as can be seen from ( [ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "diagramatically spoken we did nothing else than another renormalization in order to be able to use sda - theory .",
    "the broken lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] now has to be imagined as broken double lines indicating an effective interaction in the vertex .",
    "the effective potential as a function of the bare hubbard-@xmath3 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vofufcc ] for the @xmath55-lattice at @xmath92 and three different band - occupations .",
    "@xmath93 for band occupations @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 at @xmath92 ]    since the effective potential seems to saturate for larger values of @xmath3 we restricted ourselves to @xmath3-values up to @xmath98 .",
    "the sda - qdos is mainly given by two wheighted @xmath88-like peaks .",
    "this two - peak structure is conserved in our mrpa - method .",
    "this can be seen from fig.[fig : sda ] , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are plotted for @xmath70 and @xmath101 as a function of energy .",
    "upper graphs : @xmath99 for @xmath70 and @xmath102 , the two - peak structure of the two - particle spectral density is clearly visible in the upper left graph ; the lower graph shows @xmath103 to indicate the poles of ( [ eq : n_vert ] ) ]    the effect of the sda is that the upper set of @xmath26-dependent curves , i.e. the one shifted by @xmath104 as aresult of the sda - input , shows a dispersion too .",
    "this set could be identified as optical modes which are not present in rpa - theory .",
    "calculations for the real substances fe @xcite and ni @xcite , however , indicate that a separation between acoustical and optical modes about @xmath104 is one order of magnitude to large .",
    "that is why we only did look at the low lying excitation mode .",
    "in this section we present the results of mrpa and rpa .",
    "the latter one we used as the established ",
    "theory for our purposes .",
    "in mrpa we restricted ourselfs to the @xmath55-lattice since an asymmetric quasi particle density of states ( q - dos ) supports the tendency towards a ferromagnetic alignement of the spins in the hubbard - model @xcite .",

    "[ fig : sda_eofx ] @xmath107 is plotted for rpa and mrpa for fixed band occupations in either case .",
    "we see that in rpa theory the magnon energy at the edge of the fbz continuously increases up to a maximum and afterwards decreases with higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "in mrpa the magnon energy at the edge of the fbz decreases continously with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this is in contrast to a statement given by bnemann et.al.@xcite where the authors found the opposite behaviour using ( multiband ) rpa namely increasing @xmath27 with increasing @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite using their recently developed multiband gutzwiller - ansatz .",

    "[ fig : hf_tcofn+tvonn ] .",
    "figure [ fig : hf_tcofn+tvonn ] compares hf - phase diagrams with the corresponding phases where the spin wave mode , indicated by subscript sw , exsists for three interaction strengths @xmath3 for the @xmath53-lattice .",
    "one example shows a similar behaviour for the @xmath55-lattice .",
    "numerically we distinguished the sw phase by looking at the stiffness or the magnon energy at the edge of the fbz respectively .",
    "this means that whenever the stiffness @xmath27 becomes negative the ferromagnetic state breaks down .",

    "[ fig : hf_tcofn+tvonn ] .",
    "since stoner - theory overestimates the possibility of ferromagnetic ordering in the hubbard - model the lack of the single particle theory is compensated by the corresponding two - particle theory and even results in new curie - temperatures .",
    "this feature of the rpa is also described for the case of neel - temperatures @xcite .    in the modified theory mrpa the influence of the collective mode on the shape of the @xmath109-phase diagram can be seen from fig .",

    "[ fig : sda_tcofn ] can be seen that the @xmath111-curves have their peaks for @xmath112 .",
