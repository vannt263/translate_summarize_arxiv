    "problems of convection induced by an internal heat source have been experimentally ( e.g. [ 5 ] ) and numerically ( e.g. [ 4 ] ) studied by many researchers .",
    "the investigations concerned the effects of the heating and cooling rate , many investigations were performed for different conditions imposed on the lower and upper boundaries . in these cases",
    "it is difficult to compare the evaluations of the heat fluxes in the heated fluid layer with the ones from the classical convection . the extent of the convection cells when the rayleigh number increases are greater than the ones in the classical rayleigh - bnard convection problem .",
    "these problems are very important for the study of the motion in the atmosphere , influencing all other processes that take place here .    in this paper a horizontal layer of viscous incompressible fluid with constant viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 is considered [ 6 ] . in this context , the heat and hydrostatic transfer equations [ 6 ] are @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the heating rate , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the potential temperature , pressure and density in the basic state . in the fluid ,",
    "the temperature at all point varies at the same rate as the boundary temperature , so the problem is characterized by a constant potential temperature difference between the lower and the upper boundaries @xmath8 .",
    "taking into account ( [ eq : heat ] ) this leads to the following formula for the potential temperature distribution [ 6 ] @xmath9.\\ ] ]    in nondimensional variables the system of equations characterizing the problem is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the velocity , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the temperature and pressure deviations from the basic state [ 6 ] , @xmath14 is the grashof number , @xmath15 is the prandtl number and @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the heating ( cooling ) rate of the layer .",
    "the boundaries are considered rigid and ideal heat conducting , so the boundary conditions read @xmath17",
    "our analytical study has two major steps : we deduce the eigenvalue problem associated with ( [ eq : ecuatie_nond])-([eq : b_conditions ] ) and then , we solve this problem using a modified method based on fourier series expansions of chandrasekhar [ 1 ] type . in [ 6 ]",
    "the numerical investigations concerned the vertical distribution of the total heat fluxes and their individual components for small and moderate supercritical rayleigh number in the presence of a uniform heat source .    in order to deduce the eigenvalue problem",
    "let us consider the viscous incompressible fluid confined into a rectangular box bounded by two rigid walls : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "first we deduce the eigenvalue problem governing the linear stability equivalent to this problem .",
    "we assume that any unknown function in ( [ eq : ecuatie_nond ] ) is of the form from [ 3 ] @xmath21 @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the box sizes . here",

    "using ( [ eq : normal_modes ] ) we have @xmath31 applying to the equation @xmath32 the curl operator , the system ( [ eq : ecuatie_nond ] ) becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the boundary conditions are @xmath35 from @xmath36 , taking into account the boundary conditions ( [ eq : eigen_bc1 ] ) , we get @xmath37 . replacing this expression in @xmath38",
    ", we obtain @xmath39 . in this way ,",
    "the system ( [ eq : eigen_1 ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ eq : eigen_bc1 ] ) reduce to the following two - point problem @xmath40 @xmath41",
    "taking into account the boundary conditions imposed for the normal component of the velocity and for the normal component of the derivative of the velocity , a method based on fourier series expansions upon complete sets of orthogonal trigonometric functions that satisfy all boundary conditions it is not possible to apply . in this way , at first , we expanded the unknown function @xmath42 upon a complete set of orthogonal chandrasekhar type functions ( see chandrasekhar [ 1 ] ) , but here these functions introduced an extraperiodicity to the problem leading to the lose of one of the physical parameters , e.g. the heating ( cooling ) rate @xmath16 .    in order to avoid this problem , let us modify the system ( [ eq : eigen_2 ] ) by a translation of the variable @xmath43 , @xmath44 , such that the eigenvalue problem becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 , with the boundary conditions @xmath47    eliminating the unknown function @xmath42 between the two equations from ( [ eq : eigen_3 ] ) , the following differential equation in the unknown function @xmath48 only @xmath49 is obtained , with @xmath50    using the same method described in detail in [ 1 ] , we introduce a new function @xmath51 and rewrite the equation ( [ eq : ecuatie_in_t ] ) as a new system in the unknown functions @xmath48 and @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the rayleigh number . the rayleigh number is an eigenvalue in ( [ eq : sistem_simplu ] ) and @xmath54 represent the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "we are interested in finding the smallest eigenvalue in ( [ eq : sistem_simplu ] ) , defining the neutral manifold .",
    "taking into account the boundary conditions for @xmath48 , we set @xmath55  @xmath56 where @xmath57 is found from the equation @xmath58 equation ( [ eq : ecuatie_neomogena ] ) has the solution @xmath59 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] the unknown coefficients @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are obtained from the system followed by imposing to the function @xmath57 to satisfy the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath48 @xmath66 replacing the obtained expressions for the coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 in the equation @xmath70 and imposing the condition that the obtained equation be orthogonal to the functions @xmath71 , @xmath72 with respect to the inner product of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , we obtain an infinite system of algebraic linear equations in @xmath75 .",
    "the secular equation is obtained by imposing the condition that the determinant of this system to vanish , i.e. @xmath76\\big\\| , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath77}{\\pi^{2}(l - k)^{2}(l+k)^{2}}\\ \\ \\",

    "in this case , a first approximation for the rayleigh number @xmath80 is obtained by taking @xmath81 and imposing to the first - order minor in the matrix associated with the infinite algebraic system in @xmath75 to vanish [ 1 ] .",

    "we performed numerical evaluations for the rayleigh number for the second and the third approximation , i.e. @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "the numerical results are presented in table 1 .    from the approximate numerical evaluations",
    "it can be seen that when the wavenumber @xmath85 is increasing , the approximate rayleigh number is also increasing .",
    "when the wavenumber is kept constant an increase in the heating ( cooling ) rate parameter leads to a decreasing of the rayleigh number .",
    "moreover , for values of the parameter @xmath16 greater than a certain value ( stabilized around 10 ) , the third approximation is greater , yet not very different , from the one obtained in the second approximation .    in fig.1 the approximate neutral curve for the parameter characterizing the heating rate @xmath86",
    "is presented .",
    "when both parameters are varying the approximate neutral surface is obtained ( fig.2 ) .

    "the obtained numerical results are also presented in table 1 .",
    "however the approximations are limited by the difficult evaluation of the associated matrix for a large number of functions in the expansion sets .",
    "also , in this cases , the convergence it is not always assured .",
    "the advantage in using this method is that the expressions of the neutral manifolds are easy to obtain .",
    ".,width=188,height=170 ]    when @xmath87 the problem reduces to the particular case of rayleigh - bnard convection and the numerical evaluation lead us to a critical value similar to the classical value for the rayleigh number , i.e. @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the stability of the mechanical equilibrium of a fluid layer , namely a problem of convection with uniform internal heat source in a parallelipipedic box .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is obtained and then investigated in order to obtain the secular equation which gives the approximate stability limits .",
    "numerical investigations were performed in order to establish the influence of the two parameters , the wavenumber and the parameter characterizing the heating ( cooling ) rate on the approximate values of the rayleigh number : when the heating ( cooling ) rate is increasing , the domain of stability is decreasing and an increase in the wavenumber enlarge the domain of stability .",
    "we pointed out that the first approximation does not work in this case and remarked that some other classical method do not work either in this case ."
