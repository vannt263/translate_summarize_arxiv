    "there are about 100 accretion - powered x - ray pulsars are known to date and many paper have been devoted as to the study of individual sources as to the reviews ones .",
    "reference @xcite were the first , who summarized the spectra and pulse profiles for the x - ray pulsars and proposed an empirical model to describe their spectra .",
    "subsequently , reference @xcite gave an overview of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "granat ( @xcite ) and comptongro ( @xcite ) data were used to investigate the pulse profiles and the evolution of the pulse periods .",
    "reference @xcite used the rxte data to analyze the pulsars whose spectra exhibited the cyclotron lines .",
    "here we shortly report results of the broad band spectral analysis of the x - ray pulsars observed by the integral observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the full review with detailed description of results for individual sources with corresponding references can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this work we used the integral observations from orbit 23 ( mjd 52629 , december 21 , 2002 ) to orbit 239 ( mjd 53276 , september 28 , 2004 ) ; these were the publicly available at that moment data and the data of the russian quota obtained as part of the galactic plane scanning ( gps ) , the galactic center deep exploration ( gcde ) , and the observations in the general program .",
    "the publicly available observations of the x - ray pulsar v0332 + 53 that were performed from orbit 272 ( mjd 53376 , january 6 , 2005 ) to orbit 278 ( mjd 53394 , january 24 , 2005 ) were used as an exception .",
    "data from the isgri detector of the ibis telescope and from the jem - x monitor were used for the analysis .",
    "for all of the detected x - ray pulsars we constructed light curves in the energy range @xmath2 kev and analyzed their variability .",
    "we constructed average spectra for persistent sources and analyzed the dependence of the spectrum on the source s state for pulsars with variable fluxes : if the spectrum did not change , we also provided an average spectrum ; otherwise , we gave the spectra of different states .",
    "to fit the spectra , we used a standard ( for pulsars ) empirical model that includes a power law with a high - energy cutoff ( @xcite ) . in certain cases ,",
    "the standard model did not describe the pulsar s spectral shape quite accurately .",
    "therefore , we introduced some additional components when fitting the spectrum : low - energy photoelectron absorption , an iron emission line described by a gaussian profile , a resonance cyclotron scattering feature .",

    "because of the low statistics data for these pulsars we used a simple power law with the photon index @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , to fit their spectra . for the pulsar ax  j1820.5 - 1434",

    "it worth mention that there are a number of features near energies @xmath88 kev in spectra reconstructed from the jem - x data that are attributable to the flaws in the current response matrix of the instrument , that makes it difficult to identify the iron emission line and to determine its parameters .",
