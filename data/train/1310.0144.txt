    "one of the spectacular phenomena associated with many classes of astrophysical objects is the formation of outflows and jets .",
    "systems which have been associated with winds and jets are active galactic nuclei ( agns e.g. , m87 ) , young stellar objects ( ysos e.g. , hh 30 , hh 34 ) , high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb e.g. , ss433 , cyg x-3 ) , black hole x - ray transients ( e.g. , grs 1915 + 105 , gro 1655 - 40 ) and low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb e.g. , cir x-1 ) . in most of the cases like ysos , x - ray binaries and agns ,",
    "the accretion disc is associated with the production of outflows and jets . in case of ysos , such as hh 30 @xcite ,",
    "the disc - jet connection has been established . in case of black hole candidates like microquasars and agns",
    ", jets have to originate from the accretion disc , since black holes do not have any atmosphere or hard surface .",
    "what is even more intriguing , is that the entire accretion disc does not seem to participate in the generation of the outflow or jet .",
    "vlbi observations of m87 @xcite have shown that the jet originates from the immediate vicinity ( @xmath0 ) of a black hole .",
    "moreover , recent detailed observations of various microquasars also show , that the jet states are strongly correlated with the spectral states of the associated accretion disc @xcite .",
    "so the physics of accretion disc is crucial to understand how the jets are launched .",
    "the thin disc , also known as the shakura - sunyaev @xmath1 disc ( ss disc ) or ` standard ' disc , was the first successful disc model to explain the thermal component of the spectra coming from the black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "however , the inner boundary of the disc was _ ad hoc _ , and the ss disc was unable to explain the hard non - thermal part of the spectra . since the inner boundary condition around a black hole is necessarily transonic , models with significant advection gained popularity , and since discs with advection tends to be hotter , it became a candidate to explain high energy radiations .",
    "out of all the disc models in the advective domain , adaf ( advection dominated accretion flow ) gained overwhelming popularity @xcite , and is a model characterized by a flow which is mostly subsonic and radiatively inefficient .",
    "however , it has been shown earlier , that more than one sonic point may exist for inviscid advective flow ( liang & thompson , 1980 ; chakrabarti , 1989 ) , and was later confirmed for viscous flow too @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that , the adaf type solutions are a subset of the general advective solutions @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , in the multiple critical ( or sonic ) point mcp domain of the energy - angular momentum parameter space , matter passing through the outer sonic point may undergo centrifugal barrier induced shock transition @xcite .",
    "a shocked accretion disc solution has various advantages .",
    "numerical simulations established that , the unbalanced thermal gradient term along the vertical direction in the post - shock region of the disc , drives bipolar outflows @xcite . in a model solution starting with sub - keplerian ( advective ) and",
    "keplerian matter , @xcite showed that the soft , hard and the intermediate spectral states can be satisfactorily explained .",
    "the post - shock disc inverse - comptonizes the intercepted soft photons to produce the hard power - law tail and produces the so - called hard spectral state , while absence of or weakened post - shock disc produces essentially the soft spectral state .",
    "these assertions are vindicated by observations @xcite , and also by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , oscillating and transient shocks explain the low - frequency quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) and its evolution during spectral state transitions @xcite .",
    "various outflow models exist in the literature @xcite which concentrate on collimation and acceleration of outflows .",
    "however , very few addressed the most important issue of the outflow rate as a function of the inflow parameters .",
    "@xcite attempted to estimate the outflow rate by considering simple hydrodynamical equations such as those applicable to conical inflows and outflows .",
    "the work of @xcite was later extended to rotating inviscid flows @xcite , as well as the viscid flows @xcite .",
    "majority of these works mentioned above , however , used a constant polytropic index and did not consider the variation of it from a large distance to the black hole and from the disc phase to the jet phase . realistically , at large distances away from the central object , matter should be cold , but as it dives into the central object its thermal and kinetic energy increases .",
    "a flow with an equation of state described by a fixed @xmath2 ( adiabatic index ) need not describe the behaviour of accreting matter properly from infinity to the horizon , because for ultra - relativistic non - degenerate gas @xmath3 , and that for non - relativistic one , it is @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2 takes intermediate values for trans - relativistic thermal energy .",
    "the equation of state ( hereafter , eos ) of a single species relativistic gas was computed by @xcite , which gave the correct description of the flow in all temperature range , and we call the eos as rp ( relativistically perfect )",
    ". however , rp is a combination of modified bessel s functions and which makes its usage non - trivial and fairly expensive from computational point of view .",
    "hence many workers proposed approximate eos for single species flow , which are close to rp and yet easy to use @xcite .",
    "for the very first time blumenthal & mathews ( 1976 , hereafter bm76 ) , used the eos of @xcite and solved for radial accretion in general relativity .",
    "following the suggestions of @xcite , @xcite proposed an eos of multi - species flow composed of electrons , protons and positrons , although eos for electron - proton flow was suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed in a general relativistic investigation that , a purely electron - positron adiabatic flow is the slowest , thermally least relativistic flow , compared to flows containing protons and leptons , and consequently , electron - positron flows do not show accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that electron - proton ( equal number of electrons & protons ) flow is not the most relativistic case .",
    "however , when the proton number density is @xmath5 of the electron number density , the flow becomes most relativistic .",
    "therefore , an estimation of the outflow rate from the inflow parameters using an equation of state of a fully ionized flow would be an important contribution . in this paper , we precisely do this .",
    "the plan of our paper is the following : in the next section , we present the assumptions and equations governing inflow and outflow from accretion discs around black holes . in section 3",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of critical point behaviour and solution of accreting flow .",
    "we then present our results exhibiting the dependence of outflow rates on flow composition , energy and angular momentum of the accretion disc .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we carry out discussion and make concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a fully ionized , adiabatic , rotating and accreting axisymmetric disc around a schwarzschild black hole . for mathematical simplicity , space - time around the black hole",
    "is described by the paczyski - wiita ( hereafter pw ) pseudo - newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "we have used pw potential in order to simplify our calculations while retaining all the essential qualitative features of strong gravity . moreover ,",
    "it is easier to incorporate more complicated physics in pseudo - newtonian scheme .",
    "earlier investigations of disc - jet system had been to employ general relativity and fixed @xmath2 eos , or general relativity with relativistic eos , or pw approach with fixed @xmath2 eos .",
    "so far , the approach with pw potential which is coupled with a variable @xmath2 eos was not attempted and ours is the first to do so .",

    "thermally , the most relativistic flow is when @xmath135 .",
    "as has been explained earlier , the flow starting with the same @xmath110 implies a flow starting with the same sound speed at infinity .",
    "since the sound speed is a measure of the thermal speed , if we compare two flows with the same thermal speed , the constituent particles will transfer less average kinetic energy ( thermal energy ) in the flow where these particles are lighter .",
    "therefore , the temperature of @xmath128 flow is lesser than the flow containing both electrons ( and/or positrons ) and heavier protons .",
    "the temperature of @xmath128 is so low that the lower inertia of the flow can not compensate for its lack of thermal energy and therefore thermally it is the least relativistic , while the flow with some amount of protons are more relativistic . although the conclusions are consistent with the previous papers @xcite , in this paper , we derived the analytical form of the adiabatic equation of state for multispecies flow ( eq .

    "[ enar.eq ] ) , as well as for outflow ( eq . [ scripto_md.eq ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath128 flow is not hot enough , they show only one physical sonic point , and has been shown in this paper . however , the flow with some amount of protons show formation of multiple sonic points and shocks .",
    "post - shock disc drives bipolar outflows .",
    "the mass outflow rate is calculated self - consistently and is found to be around a few percent .",
    "interestingly , the mass outflow rate is also generally higher for flows with @xmath179 . since , the shock forms at a larger distance for flows with a higher angular momentum , the mass outflow rate is also generally lower for high angular momentum flow .",
    "the mass outflow rate depends on many factors , the shocks location , the angular momentum , energy or composition of the accretion flow . if the shock location is smaller ( say for lower angular momentum ) , the compression ratio is larger , and the mass outflow increases .",
    "but we have shown that the mass outflow rate do not increase monotonically with the compression ratio , rather the mass outflow rate peaks at some intermediate value .",
    "we also plotted the parameter space for the shock in presence of the mass loss . due to the loss of matter",
    ", the post - shock pressure is reduced , and therefore the entire range of parameters for which steady shock condition is satisfied ( the so - called shock - domain ) for flow without mass loss , also shrinks . hence there is a possibility of mass loss induced shock instability too . since shocks do not form for @xmath126 or @xmath128 flow , purely @xmath128 jet solutions are not found , although lepton dominated ( @xmath208 ) jets are possible . it must be noted that a purely @xmath128 flow is essentially a flow described by fully ionized single species eos . at temperatures",
    "@xmath209 the flow is likely to be fully ionized . a fully ionized flow comprised of similar particles",
    "can only be @xmath128 flow . however , at the same time , an accretion disc from large distances to the horizon and made up of only the pair plasma is not likely to happen in nature .",
    "we compared @xmath128 flow with other flows containing protons , only to show the stark contrast between a physically plausible flow and a flow which is not viable .",
    "moreover , it is to be noted that in principle , @xmath105 should be computed from physical processes self - consistently and not supplied as a parameter . in a given disc",
