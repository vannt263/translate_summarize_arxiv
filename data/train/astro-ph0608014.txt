    "depending on the selection techniques used , some 10 - 30% of luminous quasars show blueshifted broad absorption lines ( bals ) indicative of substantial outflows . by carrying away angular momentum , these outflows may be a fundamental part of the accretion process , and they may also be important for chemically enriching the interstellar and even intergalactic mediums .",
    "there is still no consensus about the nature of bal quasars , however , although many possibilities have been discussed ( e.g. weymann et al . 1991 ) .",
    "one possibility is that quasars only possess such high - velocity outflows during a relatively short - lived evolutionary phase during which they blow material out of the nuclear region ( e.g. , voit et al .",

    "2000 ; gregg et al . 2002 ; gregg et al .",
    "another is that bal quasars and normal quasars may be unified through orientation as for some other agn classes . in this popular equatorial paradigm ,",
    "bals are seen in quasars viewed at high inclination angles such that the line of sight passes through an equatorial wind ( e.g. , hines & wills 1995 ; cohen et al .",
    "1995 ; goodrich & miller 1995 ; murray & chiang 1995 ) .",
    "polarimetry can be a useful tool for testing the latter idea , `` unification by orientation , '' because scattering processes leading to polarization when geometric asymmetries are present .",
    "antonucci ( 1983 ) first pointed out that seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies both display optical polarization , but in the type 1 galaxies the polarization electric vector is parallel to the radio axis , while in type 2 galaxies the two are perpendicular , suggesting different geometries for the two types and helping to lead to the unification of seyfert galaxies through orientation .",
    "spectropolarimetry of ngc 1068 ( antonucci & miller 1983 ) showing a type 1 broad - lined spectrum in polarized light made the case compelling .",
    "broad - lines and continuum may be scattered by a polar scattering region along the jet axis , leading to perpendicular angles , while equatorial scattering in a seyfert 1 leads to the parallel angles .",
    "this work has been greatly expanded in recent years ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2004 ) and also applied to radio - loud agns at both low and high redshift ( e.g. , cimatti et al . 1993 ; cohen et al .",

    "very few have shown extended jets permitting this test .    in order to pursue questions concerning the nature of bal quasars , we searched for bal quasars with extended radio structures by examining sloan digital sky survey quasars ( schneider et al .",

    "the observations were split into four 300s exposures , each at a different orientation of the half - wave plate ( 0@xmath2 22.5@xmath2 , 45@xmath2 , 67.5@xmath2 ) .",

    "we reduced the data using standard iraf procedures .",
    "we extracted the spectra with identical 4  wide apertures for the o and e - rays , and re - sampled all 8 individual spectra ( o and e - rays for the 4 half - wave plate positions ) to the same linear dispersion ( 2.6 / pix ) in order to calculate the polarization in identical spectral bins .",
    "we used the procedures of vernet ( 2001 ; see also vernet et al .",
    "2001 ) , which are based on the method described by cohen et al .",
    "we checked the polarization angle offset between the half - wave plate coordinate and the sky coordinates against values obtained for the polarized standard stars bd_12_5133 and ngc  2024  nir1 and the unpolarized standard star gd  50 ; our values are within @xmath4 from the published values , and the polarization percentage within 0.1% .",

    "the c iv bal has a balnicity index ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) of 1073 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the homogenized radio data available through the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) shows that the radio spectrum of pks @xmath5 is steep , with a radio spectral index @xmath12 = @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "averaging over the central spectral region where the signal - to - noise ratio is high and the data are well behaved , pks 0040 - 005 shows intrinsic continuum polarization ( @xmath15 ) at a well - defined position angle(@xmath16 ) .",
    "the polarization is intrinsic . the interstellar polarization ( isp ) from aligned dust grains is expected to be very low toward this sight line , since the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) extinction e(b - v ) is only 0.017 mag , and the maximum isp polarization should be less than @xmath17 ( serkowski et al .",
    "1975 ) , or 0.15% .",
    "furthermore , the polarization rises in the c iv bal trough bottom ( and perhaps lyman @xmath12 ) showing that the polarization must be intrinsic . rising polarization in trough bottoms",
    "is seen in many bal quasars and has been interpreted as the result of the scattered line of sight being less absorbed than the direct line of sight ( e.g. , ogle et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "while we prefer an explanation of scattering as the origin of the polarization , the data quality is insufficient to completely rule out synchrotron emission .",
    "the polarized flux spectrum is noisy and not inconsistent with a power - law .",
    "pks 0040@xmath0005 is a steep spectrum fr ii radio source with strong lobes and a weak core , suggestive that it is not being viewed directly jet on which is usually required for synchrotron to be important , but the polarization level here is relatively weak and it is possible and has been seen in other sources ( schmidt & smith 2000 ) .",
    "we argue below , under the assumption that the polarization arises from scattering , that pks 0040@xmath0005 and its bal outflow is not seen at a particularly high inclination angle .",
    "the case for this is only stronger if the polarization is from beamed synchrotron .",
    "the position angle of the continuum polarization ( @xmath16 ) is close to parallel to the large - scale radio axis ( @xmath18 ) , a difference of 15@xmath2 , and is the first bal quasar found with this property . in analogy to the seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies / quasars , this suggests a geometry in which pks 0040@xmath0005 is not seen edge - on , but at some modest inclination angle ( consistent with the smallish but double - lobed radio structure ) , and the scattering takes place in an equatorial scattering region .",

    "( 2004 ) .",
    "lamy & hutsemkers ( 2004 ) explored the concept of a `` two component wind '' for bal quasar outflows , that included both equatorial and polar outflows , and had support from theoretical models ( e.g. , proga 2000 , 2003 ; pereyra et al .",
    "2004 ) , which are variations of the disk wind of murray et al .",
    "lamy & hutsemkers ( 2004 ) were trying to explain not only some correlations they found in the polarimetric properties and their relationship to bal properties , but also the source of the polar scattering region .",
    "the fact that sometimes polarization angle rotations are seen across emission lines in bal quasars , or with changes in wavelength , is suggestive that more than one scattering path is likely present .",
    "our observation of pks @xmath5 fits into this picture , and in fact its other properties are also consistent with the relationships lamy & hutsemkers ( 2004 ) report : the continuum polarization is low which corresponds to a large bal detachment and weak absorption in the polarized flux spectrum .    we can compare the alignment in pks @xmath5 to other bal quasars .",
    "table 1 summarizes the optical polarization properties and radio position angles of bal quasars for which both quantities have been reported .",
    "references provided for each are relevant to the discovery or classification , or provide details for the information given in the table .",

    "2001 ) . when type 2 objects are restricted to those with scattering polarization , the radio and polarization axes are perpendicular .    before our observation of pks",
    "0040@xmath0005 , it would have been easy to conclude based only on the available angle differences that bal quasars were , like type 2 agns , seen edge - on .",
    "there are some selection effects at work , however , with so few bal quasars having this measurement available",
    ". a `` jet on '' quasar will be a smaller radio source than it would with the jet in the plane of the sky ( as would young sources ) , and will be less likely to be resolved in first maps .",
    "furthermore , sources dominated by equatorial rather than polar scattering often have weak polarization due to larger dilutions from the face - on quasar ( although dust present in some bal outflows , especially low - ionization bal quasars , may also reduce dilution ) , and for agns seen directly face - on the scattering polarization is expected to be zero .",
    "for instance , the highly polarized low - ionization bal quasar first j1556 + 3517 ( brotherton et al .",
    "1997 ) has a flat and variable radio spectrum , signs of a jet - on source , but has not been resolved even with vlbi ( jiang & wang 2003 ) .",
    "while our spectropolarimetry of pks 0040@xmath0005 represents only one data point , it joins a growing list of observations that pose problems for the equatorial paradigm .",
    "the present observation is not the only evidence against simple orientation schemes . over the last decade ,",
    "evidence against edge - on geometries has emerged from several avenues , the strongest involving radio emission .",
    "the properties of radio sources have long been understood to depend greatly upon how they are seen .",
    "barvainis & lonsdale ( 1997 ) and becker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) pointed out that bal quasars have both flat and steep radio spectra .",
    "typically , jet - on sources with optically thick beamed synchrotron radiation have flat radio spectra , while edge - on sources are dominated by optically thin radio lobe emission which has a steep spectrum .",
    "the first study was on formally radio - quiet objects , but the becker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample has radio - loud objects of both types .",
    "furthermore becker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) noted that very few of the radio - selected bal quasars were extended at first survey resolutions compared to similarly selected , unabsorbed quasars .",
    "some of these bal quasars were compact steep spectrum sources , which have been hypothesized to be young sources ( odea 1998 ) .",
    "gregg et al . ( 2002 ) and gregg et al . ( 2006 ) , studying examples of fr ii bal quasars developed this idea into an evolutionary hypothesis , that a bal phase evolves into a radio - loud phase , with only a short temporal overlap .",
    "zhou et al . ( 2006 ) find a number of bal quasars associated with radio sources that vary on relatively short timescales indicating extreme brightness temperatures that can only be explained by beaming within 20 degrees of the jet direction .",
    "another radio oddity for bal quasars is noted by white et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , reporting that bal quasars on average seem to have higher average radio fluxes than unabsorbed quasars ( it should be noted that the majority are not radio loud ) .",
    "these radio properties seem quite difficult to explain in terms of a single preferred orientation .",
    "additionally , at optical / ultraviolet wavelengths , bal quasars have been noted to lie at an extreme of the `` eigenvector 1 '' of boroson & green ( 1992 ) , showing an excess of broad optical fe ii emission and a deficit of [ o iii ] emission ( boroson 2002 ; yuan & wills 2002 ) .",
    "turnshek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) followed up on this idea , using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to obtain ultraviolet spectra of quasars with weak [ o iii ] emission , finding approximately 1/3 of these to show c iv bals .",
    "telfer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conducted an hst imaging survey for extended narrow - line regions they expected to see if bal quasars were edge - on quasars , but no such extensions were found .",
    "the weak nlr emission in particular is difficult for orientation models to explain , since the spectra of edge - on type 2 objects are remarkable for their prominent narrow emission lines .",
    "x - ray observations of bal quasars may also be problematic for the equatorial paradigm .",
    "punsly ( 2006 ) points out that the absorbing columns measured with x - ray telescopes toward bal quasars are not smaller than those toward type 2 quasars .",
    "disk wind models predict they should be , and punsly argues that the observational selection effects seem insufficient to account for this inconsistency .",
    "finally , we have omitted one object from table 1 that may also have aligned axes and a polar bal outflow , but the situation is not clear cut .",
    "markarian 231 has appeared in the literature with both small ( antonucci 1983 ) and large @xmath19 ( smith et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the vlba observations of ulvestad et al .",
    "( 1999 ) may indicate a jet direction ( @xmath365@xmath2 ) quite different from the large scale radio structure ( @xmath35@xmath2 ) , which may be an issue of general concern , although mrk 231 is not radio - loud like the high - redshift entries in the table .",
    "another difficulty involves the fact that the polarization angle rotates significantly in the far ultraviolet ( smith et al .",
    "1995 ) , and that in mrk 231 and other objects it is not always clear at what wavelength the polarization position angle should be compared to the radio position angle .",
    "angle rotations indicate multiple scattering axes in a number of bal quasars , and type 1 seyferts can show both polar and equatorial scattering ( smith et al . 2004 ) .",
    "supporting a polar outflow in mrk 231 , punsly & lipari ( 2005 ) claim there is an outflow aligned with the small - scale jet angle based on two - dimensional spectroscopy of the blue wing of h@xmath12 .",
    "pks 0040@xmath0005 is a radio - loud bal quasar with low but intrinsic continuum polarization .",
    "the electric vector of the continuum polarization is close to parallel to the position angle of the quasar s extended radio structure .",
    "this is naturally explained as the result of scattering in an equatorial region with a face - on geometry , just as in seyfert 1 and broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "our result , taken in conjunction with other results in the literature , seems to be the end of the popular but apparently too simple idea that bal outflows are always equatorial .",
