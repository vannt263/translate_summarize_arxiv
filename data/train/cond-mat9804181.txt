    "the venerable problem of a random walk on a regular @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic , infinite lattice continues to generate considerable interest @xcite-@xcite , from both novel quantities associated with the simple walk and new variations of the walk itself . in the simplest case ( which is called plya walk @xcite )",
    ", the walker moves to one of the nearest neighbor sites with probability @xmath2 at each time step .",
    "one of the variations involves a `` taboo '' site , to which the walker may never visit .",
    "the question that is usually asked refers to the probability @xcite , @xcite ( `` taboo probability '' ) of the walker visiting a certain site on the @xmath3-th step without having visited the taboo site on any of the erlier steps @xmath4 .",
    "an alternative way to think about the taboo site is to consider it as an irreversible trap , so that the above question translates into a question on the survival probability .",
    "a slightly different situation is when the walker arriving at a neighboring site of the taboo , is let to remain stationary , with probability @xmath2 , instead of moving into the forbidden site .",
    "all these variations belong to the chapter of lattice walks with `` defective '' sites in the theory of lattice walks @xcite . in this paper , we investigate a further case of walks with a defective site , namely , the walker _ hopping over _ this special site . since it is no longer `` taboo '' ( in the above sense ) , it will be referred to as the `` hop - over '' site .",
    "we write the master equation for such a walk , with @xmath5 arbitrary hop - over rates .",
    "thanks to translational invariance , we may choose to locate the hop - over site at the origin .",
    "in fourier space , we obtain a closed expression , in terms of the inverse of a matrix , for the probability distribution generating function , given a particular initial position @xmath6 .",
    "similar to the derivation of `` taboo probabilities '' , the straightforward way to find the hop - over probabilities would rely on a study of return probabilities and first passage times . in this approach , probabilities of returning to the neighborhood of the origin _ without _ hopping over it are exploited in infinite sums over individual hop - over attempts .",
    "a similar method was used for solving the related problem of tagged diffusion @xcite .",
    "our present approach is different , considerably simpler and more compact in terms of formulas . instead of infinite sums",
    ", only the inverse of a certain @xmath7 matrix needs to be computed . in @xmath8 , where this walk displays the most interesting characteristics ,",
    "the inversion is quite simple .",
    "we are also able to keep track of both the direction and the frequency of the hop - over attempts . as a result , an interesting application is the diffusive behavior of a tagged particle @xcite .",
    "such a tag may also be thought of as a `` passive walker '' , namely , a particle which remains inert until it is forced to exchange places with a normal , `` active '' random walker . in metals or alloys , an impurity atom can play the role of a tag , while a vacancy diffuses as a typical walker @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we will discuss how to map the hop - over problem to the tagged walk . finally , from the frequency of hop - over attempts , we can compute the distribution of `` hits '' received by the tag .",
    "we present two related applications : the first studies the rate of disordering of the surface of an a - b alloy , with a certain type of interactions , due to the wandering of a surface vacancy , while the second investigates the asymptotic time evolution of the disorder caused by a single brownian vacancy in an initially completely phase seggregated , two - species system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the model and the master equation",
    "are carefully defined ( sections 2.1 and 2.2 ) and the explicit solution is presented allowing for the extraction of the statistics on the hop - over events ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "section 3 presents the relationship to the tagged diffusion problem with its complete solution through the techniques of section 2 .",
    ", along with two associated applications presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary and possible generalizations .",
    "for completeness , we devote the first subsection to definitions , notations , and some well known properties of a random walk on a lattice .      on a infinite @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice ,",
    "the sites are labeled by @xmath9 while the set of 2d lattice vectors is denoted by @xmath10 . a walker , performing a pure random walk of plya type @xcite , @xcite moves from a site to one of the @xmath5 nearest neighbor sites at each time step ( i.e. , from @xmath9 to @xmath11 ) with probability @xmath12 . if @xmath13 , the walker remains stationary with probability @xmath14 .",
    "given an initial position @xmath6 we are interested in the probability distribution of finding the walker after @xmath3 steps at site @xmath9 : @xmath15 . here , the superscript @xmath16 reminds us that this is the distribution for `` free '' diffusion .",

    "we summarize their properties here .",

    "let us place the hop - over site at the origin .",
    "the probability for the walker to hop from @xmath51 to @xmath36 will be denoted by @xmath52 . by keeping this rate different from @xmath12",
    ", we will be able to log the different hop - over attempts .",
    "clearly , @xmath53 , the distribution with such a site , will be a polynomial in the various @xmath52 s .",

    "we will return to these considerations in more detail below .",
    "again , we let the walker start at @xmath6 , which is not the origin , i.e , @xmath56 the subsequent evolution of @xmath57 is governed by the following master equation : @xmath58    \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\sum_{\\{{\\bf a}\\}}\\delta _ { { \\bf s},{\\bf a } } \\left [ p_{{\\bf a}}p_n^h(-{\\bf a}|{\\bf s_0 } ) -\\left(p_{-{\\bf a}}-p\\right )   p_n^h({\\bf a}|{\\bf s_0})\\right ]   \\label{mehop } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right shows that the walker never visits the forbidden site ( @xmath59 ) and that , away from the neighborhood of the origin , it performs a simple plya walk ( a `` free walk '' ) . the latter term describes the possibility of hop - over , when the walker finds itself on a nearest neighbor site of @xmath60 ( see fig.1 . )    going over to ( @xmath61 ) space by ( [ gendeff],[gendefp ] ) , this equation becomes @xmath62   e^{i{\\bf k\\cdot } { \\bf a}}\\quad .",

    "note that a quite a few sums over @xmath88 decouple .",

    ", this expression shows the non - trivial effect of a single hop - over site on the random walk explicitly .",
    "the various terms can be easily interpreted : the second term removes the ( free ) walks which pass through the origin , while the last two takes into account walks which land on a neighbor . if we take the usual continuum limit ( the lattice spacing @xmath95 , unit time - step @xmath96 , such that @xmath97 ) of this expression , the effect becomes vanishingly small",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising , since a single site can not affect the properties of the random walker in the large distance , long time limit .",
    "however , buried in this approach is a non - trivial question , namely , the statistics associated with the hop - overs ( how often and in which direction does the walker hops over the origin ) . that is the subject of the next section .",
    "next , we turn to a study of the statistics of the hop - overs . note that , due to the longer jumps ( across the origin ) , the walker suffers an _ extra _ displacement when compared to the simple free walk .",
    "we define the variable @xmath98 as the _ negative _ of this extra displacement , for reasons that will become obvious later",
    ". we will also be interested in the number of times a hop - over jump has occurred .",
    "thus , we define @xmath99 as the probability that , starting from @xmath6 , the walker arrives at site @xmath9 after @xmath3 steps ,    * having performed @xmath100 hops over the origin and * suffering a total `` extra '' displacement equal to @xmath101 .    as usual",
    ", it is more convenient to work with generating functions in fourier space .",
    "accordingly , we trade the variables ( @xmath102 ) and ( @xmath103 ) for their conjugates : ( @xmath104 ) and ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we can write : @xmath106",
    "once @xmath107 is known , the inverse transforms will lead us to the distribution itself : @xmath108    to arrive at an expression for @xmath109 , we first study a more detailed distribution : @xmath110 , i.e. , the probability of the walker makes exactly @xmath111 hops from @xmath112 to @xmath36 ( for each @xmath36 ) . here",
    "@xmath113 denotes the set of @xmath5 numbers associated with the different directions of hop - over .",
    "since each hop - over may occur only with probability @xmath52 , and the events are independent , we conclude that @xmath114 must contain the factor @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is product over all the @xmath5 nearest neighbors .",
    "meanwhile , the extra displacement is just @xmath117 , so that @xmath118 in terms of generating functions , this expression becomes : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the generating function and fourier transform of @xmath121 .",
    "armed with these considerations , we interpret the expression ( [ ph ] ) physically .",
    "expanding @xmath69 in a power series in the @xmath52 s , we see that @xmath57 itself is a power series in these rates .",
    "naively , it is tempting to identify these co - efficients with @xmath122 .",
    "however , there is an _ implicit _ probability for the walker to _ remain _ at the site @xmath51 :",
    "@xmath123 so that the co - efficient of @xmath52 also includes paths that avoid the origin . another way to see",
    "this difficulty is through the original master equation ( [ mehop ] ) , in which a particular @xmath52 appears twice , once in the `` gain '' of @xmath124 and once in the `` loss '' of @xmath125 .",
    "of course , both of these terms represent the _ same _ jump .",
    "therefore , to avoid double counting , we can label one of them by @xmath126 and , only at the end , set @xmath127 .",
    "let us emphasize that , with @xmath128 , total probability will not be conserved .",
    "but this is precisely the trick for distinguishing making a hop - over jump from _ not _ making one .",
    "for definiteness , let us choose to label the `` gain '' term by @xmath129 .",
    "a little care leads us to a modified version of ( [ gamma ] ) : @xmath130 from which we can find @xmath131 note that the overline over a quantity symbolizes the dependence on both sets of rates : @xmath132 and @xmath76 .    with this trick , we can associate the co - efficient of @xmath133 , in a power series expansion of @xmath134 , with walks that include @xmath111 hop - overs ( jumps from @xmath112 to @xmath36 ) .",
    "now , we must pick out these co - efficients and then multiply them with the correct weight : @xmath135 .",
    "this is accomplished by applying @xmath136 for each @xmath36 , so that @xmath137    substituting eq .",
    "( [ invertna ] ) back into ( [ karacsony ] ) , we see that the dependence on the variables @xmath111 factorizes .",
    "performing the sums over each @xmath111 , we arrive at : @xmath138 i.e. , @xmath139 in other words , @xmath140 is nothing but @xmath141 with all the @xmath142 s simply replaced by @xmath143 .    from expression ( [ phtilde ] ) for @xmath134 , we write explicitly : @xmath144 where @xmath145 + p\\left ( e^{i{\\bf k\\cdot } { \\bf a }   } -1\\right )   \\label{repgt}\\ ] ] and @xmath146    due to the extra factor @xmath147 , it is difficult , even for the isotropic hop - over walk , to invert @xmath148 in arbitrary @xmath149 however , since most of the interesting effects occur in @xmath8 ( where the return probability approaches unity for large times ) , the @xmath150 matrix can always be inverted .      finally , if we are interested in the simple hop - over problem in which all the rates are identical , then we simply set all @xmath52 s to @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", we should also retrieve the pure random walk if we _ subtract _ the extra displacements due to the hop - overs .",
    "in other words , let us consider the probability of finding the walker at @xmath151 , regardless of how many hop - overs occured or their directions .",
    "thus , we study @xmath152 again , it is easier to study the generating function in fourier space : using @xmath153 as the variable conjugate to @xmath154 , we see that the above sums result in : @xmath155 setting in ( [ repgt ] ) @xmath156 for each @xmath36 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 we see that @xmath159 .",
    "thus , from ( [ phtilde ] ) , we obtain @xmath160 justifying our expectation that , if we _ subtract _ the displacements due to hop - overs , the simple random walk re - emerges .",
    "the problem of tagged diffusion has been solved previously @xcite ( in two - dimensions),@xcite ( in @xmath0-dimensions ) , using a `` direct '' approach , i.e. , by keeping track of all the possible ways for the tag to be displaced by a random walker . in this section",
    ", we will first show that the above analysis can be applied to provide a new approach to this venerable problem . as examples of applications of our results ,",
    "we devote the latter subsections to the dynamics of two particular physical systems .      for completeness ,",
    "let us describe tagged diffusion in terms of a `` passive '' random walker .",
    "returning to our infinite @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice , we place two walkers , one active and one passive . respectively , we label them b ( for brownian ) and t ( for tagged , or tracer , particle ) . the former performs the simplest random walk , as in section 1.1 with @xmath38 . when b attempts to move to the site occupied by t , the two simply exchange places .",
    "thus , t does not move except when it is `` kicked '' by b. in this sense , the motion of t could be called `` passive '' and will be referred to as a `` _ brownian driven walk _ '' .",
    "the mathematical properties of this pair of walkers are contained in the joint probability latexmath:[\\[\\phi _ n^\\nu ( { \\bf r},\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\rho$ }    @xmath154 and t at site @xmath162 , on the @xmath3-th step of b and the @xmath100-th step of t. note that , @xmath100 just represents the number of `` kicks '' t received from b. the last arguments refer to the initial condition , i.e. , t being at the origin @xmath59 and b at site @xmath163 .    from the description",
    "above , it is clear that , _ relative to _",
    "t , b is performing a random walk with a hop - over site .",
    "thus , @xmath164 of the previous section , provided @xmath165 , and @xmath166 which is just the position of b relative to t. of course , we expect the results following this approach to be identical to those from the more `` direct '' approaches in @xcite and @xcite . to be brief , here we will present only a certain projection of the distribution @xmath167 , and compare the results with those in ref .",

    "of course , for @xmath199 , the scaling analysis above implies that @xmath200 in @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively . above two dimensions , the return probability of the random walker remains less than unity as @xmath46 , so that @xmath182 decays exponentially in @xmath100 .      in some binary alloys ,",
    "an ordered state consists of a and b atoms occupying alternate sites on a cubic lattice . under appropriate conditions ,",
    "an atom can not move unless a vacancy comes in contact and exchanges places with it ( also coined as the ` vacancy - mechanism ' ) @xcite-@xcite . therefore",
    ", each atom can be regarded as a passive walker , while the vacancy plays the role of an active walker .",
    "more precisely , consider a monolayer , composed of a and b atoms in a square lattice , adsorbed on a substrate which interacts strongly with these atoms in such a way that the ground state ( of the monolayer ) is a simple checkerboard configuration ( antiferromagnetic state , in the spin language ) . to simplify the problem further",
    ", we suppose that the _ intra_layer interactions are negligible .",
    "a similar arrangement may be realised by a binary alloy in a nacl structure on a simple cubic lattice , with extreme anisotropic interactions .",
    "if the interactions are much stronger along the c - axis and we are focusing on a ( 0,0,1 ) surface , the surface atoms will experience a much larger interaction with the bulk than with their neighbors on the surface . for clarity",
    ", we will distinguish the surface atoms from bulk ones , through labeling the former by a / b and the latter by a / b .",
    "the ground state , is shown in fig . 2a , with only ab and ba bonds ( and , of course , ab and ab ones ) . given our assumptions , bb or aa bonds , considered as `` mismatches '' , will be more costly .",
    "thus the movement of the vacancy can cause such excitations ( fig .",
    "2b ) . in a typical system",
    ", the vacancy will not perform a pure random walk , since its movements will be governed by these excitation ( or de - excitation ) energies .",
    "however , if subjected to sufficiently high temperatures , we could neglect this dependence and approximate the vacancy by a brownian particle .",
    "= 3.4 in    focusing on such a vacancy wandering in our monolayer , we can investigate the evolution of the excitation energy through the creation of the mismatches .",
    "in particular , the analysis above can be applied to answer the following question : after a long time ( @xmath203 ) what is the expected excitation energy caused by this vacancy ? being proportional to the expected number of `` mismatches '' , this energy shift can be found readily . note that , though the discussion above is clearly based on a @xmath8 surface adsorbed on a @xmath204 bulk , our considerations will be applicable in any @xmath149    first , let the _ vacancy _",

    "then we tag _ each _ atom simply by its initial location . alternatively , using ( [ srrho ] ) , we may use @xmath6 ( instead of @xmath205 ) to label the particle _ uniquely_. after the vacancy has taken @xmath3 steps , atom ` @xmath206 ' has suffered @xmath100 displacements with probability @xmath207 , which is found in ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath100 is odd , there is a `` mismatch '' for that particle .",
    "the _ expected _ total number of mismatches is therefore expressed by : @xmath208 \\phi _ n^\\nu ( { \\bf s_0})\\ ; ,   \\label{mismnr}\\ ] ] where the prime on the summation symbol means that @xmath209 is excluded .",

    "the @xmath46 behavior can then be extracted by exploiting the discrete tauberian theorem ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , pp . 118 . ) .    in @xmath201 , where we have a linear chain of atoms ( adsorbed on a two dimensional bulk ) ,",
    "we find that the expected number of mismatches grows like : @xmath216 it is interesting to compare this result to the _ expected number of distinct sites _ visited in an @xmath3-step walk , which is a well known quantity @xcite . in @xmath201",
    ", it grows like : @xmath217 thus , we find that @xmath218 as @xmath46 , i.e. , _ half _ of the visited sites will have mismatches . these results are hardly surprising , since , at any time , only the string of atoms between the walker and its initial position are `` mismatched '' .    for @xmath8 , the physical case ,",
    "the results are more interesting . with the help of the same theorem",
    ", we find : @xmath219 whereas @xcite @xmath220 so that ( [ wow1d ] ) proves to be valid in this case also .",
    "though bulk materials in 4 or higher dimensions are not physical , we may nevertheless consider the number of expected mismatches in @xmath221 .",
    "here , @xmath222 is finite , leading to @xmath223 comparing it with @xmath224 we find , instead of ( [ wow1d ] ) , a more `` interesting '' result : @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the probability that the walker ever returns to its starting site , another well known quantity in the theory of random walks .",
    "actually , eqn .",
    "( [ wow3d ] ) is in fact valid for any @xmath227 for @xmath228 , the walk is recurrent , i.e. , @xmath229 , reducing ( [ wow3d ] ) to 1/2 . only for @xmath230 , is the walks transient , where @xmath231 .",
    "an alternative way to display ( [ wow3d ] ) is to quote the ratio of particles performing an even number of exchanges with the hole to those `` visited '' an odd number of times . clearly , this ratio is simply @xmath226 .",
    "these remarks give an intuitive explanation for ( [ wow3d ] ) .",
    "since the random walk is recurrent in @xmath232 , every particle is sure to be _ revisited . _",
    "therefore , there should be as many particles visited an odd number of times as those visited an even number of times , on the average .",
    "however , for @xmath233 , a certain amount of the particles will be visited only _",
    "once_. thus , the particles visited an odd number of times should be larger .",
    "as another example of how our results can be applied in disordering dynamics , we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the disorder induced by a single brownian vacancy @xcite .",
    "since the most interesting case is @xmath8 , we will limit our study here .",
    "the initial configuration is a completely phase segregated system , i.e. , an infinite square lattice , with the upper half plane filled with one type of particles ( white ) and the lower half with the other type ( black ) . a single vacancy ( the active random walker )",
    "is placed in the white region at the interface between the two half planes ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and labeled as the origin of our coordinate system . as the vacancy wanders , particles will be drawn into the opposite phases , leading to disordering . in the following",
    ", we will show that , after @xmath3 steps taken by the wanderer , the `` disorder - profile '' parallel and perpendicular to the interface scales as @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "the scaling functions are combinations of exponentials and a modified bessel function .",
    "= 3.4 in    let us focus on the black particles .",
    "one definition of disorder is the density of black particles in the upper half plane .",
    "thus , we seek @xmath236 the probability of finding a black particle at location @xmath9 , after @xmath3 steps of the vacancy .",
    "since each particle performs a `` passive '' random walk independent of the others , we may simply track the movements of each black particle and sum over all those which reach @xmath9 .",
    "as in previous sections each black particle can be labeled uniquely by its initial position @xmath6 .",
    "since we are not interested in neither the location of the vacancy nor the frequency of a particle being kicked it is clear that we should sum over the vacancy s position and the frequency of the hits the black particle receives .",
    "summing over all the black particles , we see that @xmath237 where @xmath238 denotes summation over the @xmath6 s in the lower half plane only , and @xmath154 is the walker s position after @xmath3 steps relative to the site @xmath6 . in terms of the generating function ( c.f . eqns .",
    "( [ togen ] ) and ( [ toback ] ) ) , we have @xmath239 where the sums over @xmath240 and @xmath154 have been carried out and the explicit dependence on @xmath6 restored .",
    "referring to eqns .",
    "( [ elso])-([explgammap ] ) , we have @xmath241 @xmath242 and @xmath243    at this point , we will restrict our attention to @xmath8 only .",
    "clearly , there is no interesting behavior in @xmath201 . on the other hand",
    ", the random walk being transient in @xmath244 disorder will be confined in the large time limit .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the matrix ( [ linvint ] ) is @xmath150 and must be inverted laboriously .",
    "the calculations involved from ( [ sumgf ] ) to ( [ linvint ] ) are reasonably straightforward , but extremely lengthy .",
    "we shall present only the final result obtained in the @xmath203 limit .    for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath245 , we obtain @xmath246 it is clear that the complete disorder is the final state , given by @xmath247 , i.e. , `` complete gray '' .",
    "as expected , this value is approached from below if @xmath248 , and from above if @xmath249 .",
    "since the frequency of `` kicks '' scales as @xmath235 , we see that the decay follows @xmath250 rather than the typical decay of a random walk , i.e. , @xmath251 .    instead of fixed @xmath9 , we seek a scaled distribution . for this",
    "we note first that disorder _ along _ the interface should arise relatively quickly , since it depends only on the presence of the random walker , which wanders afar as @xmath252 . on the other hand , disorder in the vertical direction ( from the origin )",
    "relies entirely on the wandering of the passive walkers , so that it will occur at the @xmath235 time scale .",
    "the appropriate scaling variables turn out to be @xmath253 while the final result is @xmath254 \\ln { 8n } = sgn(y)k_0(|x|)e^{-|y|}+   { \\cal o}\\left ( \\frac{1 } { \\sqrt{\\ln { n}}}\\right )    \\label{last}\\ ] ] where @xmath255 denotes the sign of @xmath256 and @xmath257 is the modified bessel function .",
    "note that the square bracket on the left hand side is a measure of the disorder , since @xmath258 is the step function that represents the initial probability distribution for finding black particles .",
    "finally , since @xmath259 for large @xmath260 , we see that the decay in both directions are dominated by exponentials ( in the scaling variables @xmath261 and @xmath256 ) .",
    "we have presented a study of a class of random walks on a @xmath0 dimensional hypercubic lattice in which the walker hops from site to nearest neighbor site with one exception .",
    "it _ hops over _ a particular site . in case",
    "the hop - over rates are isotropic , the full probability distribution was found explicitly . we have also investigated the statistics associated with the hop - overs , so that we can find both how often and in which direction the hop - overs occur .",
    "the latter study can be readily applied to the behavior of a tagged particle , which moves only if a mobile vacancy were to exchange places with it .",
    "all previously known results of tagged diffusion are easily recovered in this simpler , novel approach .",
    "finally , we showed how this study can be applied to two physical examples of the vacancy mediated disordering process .",
    "though we have focussed only on infinite systems , our methods are readily generalizable to finite ( periodic ) lattices . in three or higher dimensions ,",
    "such a generalization is crucial , since the random walk is transient , so that an infinitesimal density of vacancies can not give rise to system - wide dynamics .",
    "one way to estimate the effects of finite density is to consider finite systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "another interesting generalization is the _ biased _ random walk . with a bias",
    ", there would be little reason to study hop - over walks on an infinite lattice , since the walker never returns to the hop - over site .",
    "by contrast , on a _ finite _ lattice , the walker will `` run into '' the special site periodically . in the steady state ,",
    "i.e. , for times large compared to the traverse time , we can expect an asymmetric distribution around the `` defect '' .",
    "if the hop - over rates are also biased , say , in the opposite direction , it may be possible for an effective binding to occur .",
    "this problem can be mapped into a limiting version of the biased diffusion of two species introduced sometime ago @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to examine the walker - defect distributions and check if long range correlations @xcite also appear .",
