    "ion - solvent mixtures play a central role for various important soft matter systems such as colloidal suspensions , polymer solutions , biochemical reactions , and electrochemical cells . for most of these systems",
    "the presence of an appropriate amount of ions is crucial for their functioning .",
    "therefore the general question arises of how and to what extent ions alter the properties of a solvent .",
    "more than a century ago the considerations by arrhenius concerning the colligative properties of ionic solutions @xcite seemed to imply that the interactions of ions with their fluid environment have only a mild effect in the sense that adding salt merely modifies the composition of the ion - solvent mixture .",
    "a few decades later , after more accurate measurements had been carried out , this simple picture was questioned .",
    "bjerrum , debye , and hckel pointed out that electrostatically induced ion - ion correlations are expected to influence the ion distribution and the equation of state of electrolyte solutions @xcite .",
    "since then , the debye - hckel theory has been widely used , e.g. , in plasma physics and as an ingredient of the dlvo theory ( named after derjaguin , landau , verwey , and overbeek ) of colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "within debye - hckel theory the solvent is considered to be a uniform dielectric continuum which influences the coulomb interaction between the ions via a certain permittivity but which is otherwise inert . recently",
    "the issue of the mutual influence of ions and the solvent has been taken up again , studying the solubility of ions and the double - layer structure in a near - critical solvent @xcite , possible salt - induced changes of the solvent structure @xcite , and effects of the inhomogeneities of the permittivity close to interfaces @xcite .    these investigations require a model for the solvent at least on the mesoscopic scale as well as a description of the ion - solvent interaction . to this end",
    "one can split the pair potential between the species into the long - ranged electrostatic monopole - monopole contribution and into the remaining contributions of shorter range , which we shall refer to as chemical contributions . in the vast majority of the theoretical studies of dilute electrolyte solutions ,",
    "ions are described as point - like particles whose chemical contributions to the interactions with the solvent are modeled locally within the so - called bilinear coupling approximation ( bca ) .",
    "this amounts to a local density approximation for the chemical contribution to the excess free energy which is bilinear in the particle number densities . within the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite the ion size is accounted for by means of hard - core exclusion and solvation is modeled by non - local interactions within the so - called random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "in fact , the bca can be considered as the local version of the rpa , which is expected to be reliable only for interaction energies small compared with the thermal energy @xcite . however , the ion - solvent interaction is typically of the order of some tens of the thermal energy @xcite .",
    "therefore the application of the bca or of the rpa to ion - solvent mixtures is questionable @xcite .    in the following",
    "we show that for realistic values of the parameters the bca and the rpa indeed lead to unphysical results .",
    "since non - local models are notoriously complicated it seems worthwhile to investigate the possibility of local descriptions of ion - solvent interactions . in order to demonstrate that valuable improvements within the class of local models are possible , we propose an alternative local density approximation ( lda ) the predictions of which are in qualitative agreement with experimental results and which does not lead to the artifacts introduced by the bca . without presenting the details which will be expounded below , this lda",
    "has already been applied successfully in a recent study of the effective interaction between two planar substrates in contact with a near - critical binary liquid mixture and in the presence of salt @xcite . as far as the phase behavior , the bulk structure , and the asymptotic interfacial structure of the solvent",
    "are concerned , our results are equivalent to replacing the bare interaction energies used within the bca by effective ones which saturate for large values of the bare interaction energies . within this lda , and in contrast to the bca , more realistic estimates of the magnitude of salt - induced effects can be obtained , which are expected to be important for interpreting and designing experiments and for considering applications .    in the following , after introducing the model and the lda in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and in appendix  [ appa ] , bulk systems are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : bulk ] , where we focus on the phase diagram and on the structure of the correlation functions .",
    "similarities and differences between the proposed lda and the bca are highlighted and compared with the available experimental data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interface ] interfacial structures as well as critical adsorption in semi - infinite planar systems are discussed . for critical adsorption important qualitative differences between the lda and the bca",
    "are revealed , with the predictions of the former being in agreement with the corresponding qualitative experimental findings , whereas those of the latter are not .",

    "[ sec : colloids ] an application of the proposed lda to colloidal interactions in near - critical electrolyte solutions is discussed and compared with alternative approaches described in the literature .",

    "the arguments above lead to the assertions that , within lda , one has @xmath446",
    "( i.e. , decreasing water adsorption upon adding salt ) independently of the sign of the surface charge @xmath57 ( because the last term on the right - hand side of eq .   dominates ) , whereas within bca @xmath451 is expected to change sign upon changing the sign of @xmath57 ( because the first term on the right - hand side of eq",
    ".   dominates ) .",
    "more interestingly , using an antagonistic electrolyte ( i.e. , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 having opposite signs ) such as @xmath452 ( @xmath453 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath454 ) the first ( ion solubility ) contribution on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is dominating such that @xmath455 and @xmath57 are expected to have the same sign . in this case , upon adding salt , the amount of adsorbed water either decreases or increases depending on the sign of the surface charge .",
    "this is in contrast to electrowetting where the water adsorption increases with the magnitude but independent of the sign of the surface charge @xcite . within the bca approach of ref .",
    "@xcite the difference for cations and anions with respect to their solubility contrasts in the two pure solvent components is neglected ( i.e. , @xmath456 so that @xmath219 ) to the effect that the reported capillary condensation - like adsorption of water between two equally charged walls at variable distance should be independent of the sign of the surface charge .",
    "the analysis above implies that the same property is expected to occur for sufficiently small values of @xmath457 , but the adsorption may depend on the sign of the surface charge if @xmath457 becomes of the order unity .",
    "the interactions between colloidal particles in a fluid medium comprise dispersion forces , direct screened coulomb forces , steric forces , as well as solvent - mediated interactions , which are commonly referred to as solvation forces .",
    "if the thermodynamic state of the fluid medium is moved towards a critical point , e.g. , the critical demixing point of a binary liquid mixture , the fluctuation induced long - ranged , and universal critical casimir force emerges ; this singular contribution to the solvation force dominates @xcite . in the presence of a sufficiently strong adsorption preference of colloids or of confining walls for one of the components of the solvent",
    "the critical casimir force depends only on the relative _ signs _ of the surface fields @xmath315 acting on the order parameter at these surfaces ( and on the geometry of the latter ) but not on non - universal material parameters .",
    "the critical casimir force is attractive ( repulsive ) if the surface fields have equal ( opposite ) signs .    while being investigated theoretically for quite some time @xcite , the direct experimental verification of the critical casimir effect has been achieved only recently for a single colloidal particle dispersed in a mixture of water and 2,6-dimethylpyridine close to a planar wall @xcite . in that study",
    "the measured effective colloid - wall interaction potential was interpreted in terms of a superposition of a repulsive screened coulomb force and the critical casimir force . within this picture",
    "the direct electrostatic repulsion dominates for temperatures @xmath83 which deviate from @xmath154 more than a few tenth of a kelvin , whereas an increasingly strong casimir attraction ( repulsion ) occurs for symmetric ( antisymmetric ) boundary conditions upon approaching the critical point ( @xmath458 ) .",
    "recently these experiments have been modeled within rpa , which provides a satisfactory fitting of the experimental curves in refs .",
    "however , this approach involves a large number of model parameters @xcite , which limits the conclusiveness of these fits .",
    "the influence of adding salt onto the effective colloid - wall interaction has been studied recently @xcite using the same experimental setup as in refs .",
    "it turns out that with @xmath459 of @xmath194 the casimir attraction for symmetric boundary conditions starts to dominate the direct electrostatic repulsion already several kelvin away from the critical point ( instead of tenths of a kelvin as for the salt - free solvent ) .",
    "moreover , for antisymmetric boundary conditions , for which both the direct electrostatic and the critical casimir forces are expected to be repulsive , in the presence of salt an attraction has been detected within an intermediate temperature range .",
    "the latter observation demonstrates that , under certain conditions , assuming the simple superposition of the direct electrostatic and the critical casimir forces is insufficient to understand the actual effective interaction .",
    "based on the ginzburg - landau - like description in eq .  , which follows from the full model given in eq .",
    ", we have identified a mechanism giving rise to the aforementioned unexpected attraction for antisymmetric boundary conditions in the presence of salt @xcite . for @xmath460",
    "the cations and anions are separated close to the surfaces , where the order parameter @xmath461 is non - uniform .",
    "this gives rise to dipolar layers , which can interact with the surface charges at the distant surface .",
    "these dipole layers are expected to contribute significantly to the effective interaction if the direct electrostatic interaction is weak ; this is the case for antisymmetric boundary conditions , for which the hydrophobic wall is expected to be weakly charged .",
    "if the direct electrostatic interaction is strong , which is expected to occur for symmetric boundary conditions with hydrophilic surfaces , the dipolar layers do not significantly contribute to the effective interaction .",
    "in that case the sole effect of adding salt is to reduce the debye length and thereby to weaken the direct electrostatic repulsion relative to the critical casimir force . therefore , with salt the onset of effective attraction occurs at temperatures @xmath83 further away from @xmath154 than in the salt - free case @xcite .",
    "a conceivable alternative mechanism for the emergence of an effective attraction in the case of antisymmetric boundary conditions has been proposed which is independent of differences in the solubility of cations and anions @xcite .",
    "it has been argued within rpa that a charged wall ( of either polarity ) accumulates an increased number of ions compared to an uncharged wall . due to this enhanced total density of ions ( which are hydrophilic independent of their sign ) a charged wall should , from a distance ,",
    "appear increasingly hydrophilic upon adding salt such that for certain system parameters an underlying actually hydrophobic character of a wall might be overcompensated and turn into an effectively hydrophilic wall ; actually hydrophilic walls remain so upon adding salt @xcite .",
    "such a salt - induced apparent hydrophilicity , which would occur on the surfaces of all dissolved colloids , would in turn lead to effectively symmetric boundary conditions and thus to attractive solvation forces .",
    "however , according to fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , even in the presence of salt the excess adsorption follows the actual preference of the surface field , also upon approaching @xmath154 . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : critad ] , it is not possible to calculate the excess adsorption within bca ( and rpa ) for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , because for them within this approach the uniform bulk state is thermodynamically unstable .",
    "thus fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] demonstrates that within lda salt - induced apparent hydrophilicity does not occur ( i.e. , @xmath440 does not become negative ) .",
    "therefore there is reason to expect that salt - induced apparent hydrophilicity is an artifact of the bca and the rpa .",
    "in addition , by means of surface plasmon resonance it has been checked experimentally that the adsorption preference , in particularly of hydrophobic substrates , is not altered by adding salt @xcite .",
    "therefore , for antisymmetric boundary conditions of the order parameter , there are doubts that salt - induced apparent hydrophilicity can serve as an explanation for the experimentally observed effective attraction within an intermediate temperature range .",
    "recently , additional numerical studies within bca have been performed suggesting that ion - induced  precipitation ",
    "@xcite or non - linearities @xcite influence the effective colloid - colloid interaction .",
    "however , our results in secs .  [ sec : bulk ] and [ sec : interface ] concerning the reliability of bca point towards the possibility that those proposed effects are artifacts of the bca due to an overestimation of the ion - solvent coupling . therefore it would be worthwhile to reconsider the aforementioned proposed effects within lda , which has been shown to be consistent with presently available experimental evidence .",
    "we have derived a local density approximation ( lda ) for the density functional of point - like ions interacting locally with a binary liquid mixture acting as a solvent ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , which for large free energies of transfer of the ions improves the frequently used bilinear coupling approximation ( bca ) .",
    "it turns out that within the proposed lda , and in contrast to the bca , the influence of ions on the bulk phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , the critical point ( fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) , and the bulk structure ( figs .  [ fig:4][fig:6 ] ) is predicted to be weak .",
    "this is in agreement with the presently available experimental data .",
    "the interfacial structure at distances from a charged wall less than a few particle diameters can be predicted by neither bca nor lda , because none of these two local models accounts for the layering due to packing effects which dominate in actual fluids at such short distances .",
    "but , within both bca and lda , further away from the wall the system can be described reliably in simple terms of a uniform permittivity and an effective surface field .",
    "this description nonetheless captures the actual structure as obtained from the full numerical minimization ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) . upon approaching the critical point the subleading ( but not the leading ) contribution to critical adsorption",
    "is found to be sensitive to system and materials parameters such as the bulk ionic strength , solubility properties , surface charges , and the permittivities of the solvent components ( fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "if a salt disturbs the molecular arrangement of the solvent molecules only at small distances , it is modeled here by _",
    "point - like _ ions which interact _ locally _ with the solvent .",
    "such a salt does neither significantly alter the bulk phase behavior nor the bulk structure or the asymptotic decay of density profiles at walls .",
    "but it contributes to the interfacial structures up to distances of the order of the debye length @xmath462 as well as to critical adsorption in subleading order .",
    "if the solvent is moved thermodynamically towards a critical point , where the bulk correlation length @xmath422 diverges , the ratio @xmath463 of the range @xmath462 of the ion - related surface structure and @xmath422 becomes small , such that the leading , universal critical behavior of the solvent is not altered by adding salt@xcite .    whether the description of a given electrolyte solution within a local model is justified or not does not depend on the salt alone but on the combination of salt and solvent .",
    "experimentally observed effects in binary liquid mixtures due to adding salt , such as the shift of the critical point , depend sensitively on the type of mixture ( compare ref .",
    "@xcite for water+2,6-dimethylpyridine and ref .",
    "@xcite for heavy water+3-methylpyridine ) .",
    "moreover , the measured critical point shifts exhibit a strong dependence on the size of the ions ( compare ref .",
    "@xcite for alkali halides and ref .",
    "@xcite for sodium tetraphenylborate ) .",
    "these evidences in combination with the present analysis , which implies a weak influence of the ionic _ charge _ , lead to the conclusion that steric effects might play an important role for the ion - solvent interaction .",
    "this interpretation is supported by reports of critical point shifts of similar magnitude in binary liquid mixtures due to adding non - ionic impurities @xcite .",
    "consequently it appears as if it is mostly the property of an ion to be a structure maker or a structure breaker and only to a lesser extent its electric charge which determines the influence of a salt onto the properties of the solvent . in order to obtain",
    "quantitatively reliable predictions for electrolyte solutions , a larger effort has to be devoted to study the steric and chemical influence of ions on the solvent .    in summary , for ions dissolved in a binary",
    "solvent the bulk phase diagrams ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , the critical point shifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , the bulk two - point correlation functions ( figs .",
    "[ fig:4][fig:6 ] ) , the surface structures ( fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) , and critical adsorption ( fig .  [ fig:9 ] ) have been investigated within a novel local density approximation ( lda ) for the ion - solvent interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the commonly used bilinear coupling approximation ( bca ) turns out to strongly overestimate the influence of ions on the solvent properties in cases of realistic solvation free energies , whereas the lda introduced here , in agreement with various available experimental data , predicts small effects .",
    "although the presented lda is expected to be more accurate than the bca , the former requires the same and not more parameters than the latter . according to its derivation",
    ", the lda is expected to be reliable for small ionic strengths and on length scales larger than the particle size . both available and possible",
    "future experiments have been discussed to probe and to explore the reliability and the range of validity of the present theoretical approach .",
