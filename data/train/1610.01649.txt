    "in this paper we discuss a unified approach developed recently in @xcite towards the compensated compactness theorems in nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations ( pdes ) , with applications to the weak rigidity of isometric immersions of riemannian manifolds into euclidean spaces with lower regularity .",
    "compensated compactness has played an important role in the study of nonlinear pdes arising from fluid mechanics , calculus of variations , and nonlinear elasticity ; _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite and the references cited therein . the _ div - curl lemma",
    "_ introduced by murat and tartar @xcite is the cornerstone of the theory , which reads in the simplest and original form as follows :    [ proposition : murat - tartar ] let @xmath1 be two sequences of vector fields on @xmath2 such that @xmath3 assume that @xmath4 is pre - compact in @xmath5 and @xmath6 is pre - compact in @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath8    two distinctive approaches have been developed in the literature to prove lemma [ proposition : murat - tartar ] : one is via harmonic analysis , and the other is based on the hodge ( de rham ) decomposition theorem ; see @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "both approaches depend crucially on the geometry of the euclidean spaces or riemannian manifolds ; see  2 for a detailed exposition .",
    "see also whitney @xcite ( chapter ix , theorem 17a ) for an early version of the div - curl type lemma in the language of his _ geometric integration theory_.    one of our crucial observations in @xcite is that the div - curl lemma can be reformulated via a functional - analytic approach in generic banach spaces with two general bounded linear operators in place of _ div _ and _ curl_. indeed , all the necessary properties we need for _ div _ and _ curl _ in order to conclude the lemma can be extracted as two simple , abstract conditions : one is algebraic , and the other is analytic .",
    "both conditions can be naturally formulated in terms of operator algebras on banach spaces .",
    "this leads to the generalization of the existing versions of the div - curl lemma , and provides the third approach to the theory of compensated compactness .",
    "in addition , combining the functional - analytic compensated compactness theorem together with the ellipticity of the laplace - beltrami operator , we are ready to obtain an gemoetrically intrinsic div - curl lemma on riemannian manifolds . throughout this paper ,",
    "the term `` _ intrinsic _ '' means `` _ independent of local coordinates _ '' on riemannian manifolds .    as an application of the new div - curl lemma",
    ", we analyze the weak rigidity of isometric immersions of riemannian manifolds into euclidean spaces .",
    "the problem of isometric immersions / embeddings has been of considerable interest in the development of differential geometry , which has also led to the important developments of new ideas and methods in nonlinear analysis and pdes ( _ cf . _",
    "moreover , it is well - known in differential geometry that the gauss - codazzi - ricci ( gcr ) equations are the compatibility conditions for the existence of isometric immersions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the gcr equations can be viewed as a first - order nonlinear system of geometric pdes for the second fundamental forms and normal connections . however , in general , the gcr equations are of no type , neither purely hyperbolic nor purely elliptic .    the weak rigidity problem for isometric immersions can be formulated as follows : given a sequence of isometric immersions of an @xmath9-dimensional manifold with a @xmath10 metric , whose second fundamental forms and normal connections are uniformly bounded in @xmath11 , whether its weak limit is still an isometric immersion with the same @xmath12 metric .",
    "this rigidity problem has its motivation from both geometric analysis and nonlinear elasticity : the existence of isometric immersions of riemannian manifolds with lower regularity corresponds naturally to the realization of elastic bodies with lower regularity in the physical space .",
    "see ciarlet - gratie - mardare @xcite , mardare @xcite , szopos @xcite , and the references cited therein .    in @xcite",
    ", we have proved that the solvability of the gcr equations in @xmath13 is equivalent to the existence of @xmath14 isometric immersions on riemannian manifolds .",
    "this is done by employing the cartan formalism , also known as the method of moving frames .",
    "we have shown that both the gcr equations and isometric immersions are equivalent to the structural equations of the cartan formalism .",
    "then , by exploiting the _ div - curl structure _ of the gcr equations and the cartan formalism , we have deduced the global weak rigidity of these geometric pdes , independent of local coordinates of the riemannian manifolds .",
    "now , in view of the equivalence theorem established above , the weak rigidity of isometric immersions is readily concluded .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in  @xmath15 , we first formulate the functional - analytic compensated compactness theorem in banach spaces and give an outline of its proof , and then deduce a geometrically intrinsic div - curl lemma on riemanian manifolds as its corollary .",
    "two generalizations of the latter result are also discussed . in  3 , we collect some background on differential geometry pertaining to the gcr equations and the cartan formalism .",
    "finally , in  4 , we show the weak rigidity of isometric immersions , together with the weak rigidity of the gcr equations and the cartan formalism .",
    "in this section we first discuss a functional - analytic compensated compactness theorem . as its consequence ,",
    "we deduce a geometrically intrinsic div - curl lemma on riemannian manifolds .    to establish the original div - curl lemma , lemma [ proposition : murat - tartar ] , as well as its various generalizations ( see @xcite and the references cited therein ) , the following distinctive approaches have been adopted :    the first approach , developed by murat and tartar in @xcite , is based on _",
    "harmonic analysis_. it is observed that the first - order differential constraints , namely the pre - compactness of @xmath16 and @xmath6 in @xmath17 , lead to the decay properties of @xmath18 in the high fourier frequency region .",
    "coifman - lions - meyer - semmes in @xcite extended this lemma by combining the exploitation of this observation with further techniques in harmonic analysis , including hardy spaces , and commutator estimates of bmo functions and riesz transforms .",
    "the second approach is based on the _",
    "hodge decomposition_. robbin - rogers - temple in @xcite observed that , by writing @xmath19 @xmath20 can be decomposed into a weakly convergent part and a strongly convergent part , and similarly for @xmath21 ( also see the exposition in evans @xcite ) .",
    "for this , the advantage can be taken of the first - order differential constraints , the commutativity of the green operator @xmath22 on @xmath2 with divergence , gradient , and curl , and most crucially , the ellipticity of @xmath23 , so that , for @xmath18 , the pairing of the weakly convergent parts pass to the limits via integration by parts , and the pairings of other terms can be dealt with directly . to wit",
    ", the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath23 defined for differential forms on any oriented closed riemannian manifold @xmath24 is always elliptic , and it has a decomposition similar to : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the exterior differential and @xmath27 is its @xmath28-adjoint ( _ cf . _  6 in @xcite for the details ) , so that the div - curl lemma is ready to be generalized to riemannian manifolds .",
    "the third approach , which is the main content of this section , is _ functional - analytic_. as aforementioned , the existing div - curl lemmas are formulated in terms of vector fields or local differential forms on euclidean spaces ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , and some generalizations to riemannian manifolds are available ( _ cf . _ @xcite ) .",
    "for example , kozono - yanagisawa @xcite obtained a div - curl lemma using functional - analytic results on @xmath29 , as well as a geometric version , with emphasis on the weak convergence of vector fields up to the boundary of the domain or compact riemannian manifold , which requires the divergence and curl of the vector fields are bounded in @xmath28 .",
    "one of our key observations is that , for the `` usual '' div - curl lemmas  with the exception of certain end - point cases , _ e.g. _ , theorem [ thm _ generalised critical case , div curl lemma ] , the specific _ geometry _ of euclidean spaces or manifolds plays no essential role .",
    "based on this observation , we have formulated and established a general compensated compactness theorem through bounded linear operators on banach spaces in @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "it may be stated as follows : if two bounded linear operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 between banach spaces satisfy two conditions : one is algebraic ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are _ orthogonal _ to each other ) , and the other is analytic ( @xmath32 determines _ nearly everything _ ) , then a result in the spirit of lemma [ proposition : murat - tartar ] holds , with _",
    "div _ and _ curl _ replaced by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we now discuss the functional - analytic compensated compactness theorem on banach spaces , as well as its geometric implications .",
    "for some background on functional analysis , we refer to @xcite .",
    "let us first explain some notations : in the sequel , @xmath33 is a hilbert space over the field @xmath34 so that @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are two banach spaces over @xmath37 .",
    "we use @xmath38 , to denote the dual banach and hilbert spaces . in what follows",
    ", we consider the bounded linear operators : @xmath39 for their adjoint operators , we write @xmath40 by @xmath41 , we mean the duality pairings on suitable banach spaces , and notation @xmath42 without subscripts is reserved for the inner product on @xmath33 .",
    "for any normed vector spaces @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45",
    ", we write @xmath46 for a sequence @xmath47 in @xmath43 as a subset , and @xmath48 for a compact embedding between the normed vector spaces . we use @xmath49 to denote the norm in @xmath43 , write @xmath50 for the strong convergence of sequences under the norm , and write @xmath51 for the weak convergence .",
    "@xmath52 is the closed unit ball in @xmath43 , and @xmath53 is the open unit ball .",
    "moreover , for a linear operator @xmath54 , its kernel is written as @xmath55 , and its range is @xmath56 .",
    "finally , for @xmath57 as a vector subspace , its _ annihilator _ is defined as @xmath58 .",
    "to proceed , we define the following linear operators : @xmath59 { { s^\\dagger}\\vee{t^\\dagger } } : ( y\\bigoplus z)^*\\cong y^*\\bigoplus z^ * \\mapsto { \\mathcal{h } } , \\qquad & ( { { s^\\dagger}\\vee{t^\\dagger}})(a , b ) : = { s^\\dagger}a + { t^\\dagger}b \\end{cases}\\ ] ] for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the direct sum @xmath63 is always endowed with the norm : @xmath64 . also , it is direct to see that @xmath65 .",
    "our compensated compactness theorem is formulated in the following :    [ thm_abstract compensated compactness ] let @xmath66 be a hilbert space over @xmath37 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 be reflexive banach spaces over @xmath37 , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 be bounded linear operators satisfying    1 .",
    "orthogonality : @xmath71 2 .   for some hilbert space @xmath72",
    "such that @xmath33 embeds compactly into @xmath73 , there exists a universal constant @xmath74 so that , for all @xmath60 , @xmath75    assume that two sequences @xmath76 satisfy the following conditions :    1 .   @xmath77 and @xmath78 in @xmath33 as @xmath79 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath80 is pre - compact in @xmath67 , and @xmath81 is pre - compact in @xmath68 .",
    "then , after passing to subsequences if necessary , @xmath82    we now sketch the main steps of the proof here .",
    "the interested readers are referred to @xcite for the details .",
    "claim : _ @xmath83 has finite - dimensional kernel and closed range_. as @xmath67 and @xmath68 are reflexive , @xmath84 is also a reflexive banach space .",
    "this observation guarantees that all the assumptions ( op 1)(op 2 ) and ( seq 1)(seq 2 ) remain valid , provided that @xmath85 is replaced by @xmath84 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are surjective .",
    "thus , once step 1 has been established , we can assume that @xmath32 is _ fredholm _ in the subsequent arguments .    indeed ,",
    "to show @xmath86 , by the classical riesz lemma , it suffices to check that the closed unit ball of @xmath87 is compact in the norm topology of @xmath85 . to this end , let @xmath88 be the compact embedding in ( op 2 ) .",
    "then , for any @xmath89 such that @xmath90\\cap \\bar{b}_{{\\utilde{{\\mathcal{h}}}}}$ ] , the same condition yields @xmath91 therefore , the unit ball of @xmath92 $ ] in @xmath73 is finite - dimensional , and the same conclusion holds for @xmath87 as @xmath93 is an embedding .    to show @xmath94 as a closed subspace",
    ", we take any sequence @xmath95 such that @xmath96 in the norm topology of @xmath85 and argue that @xmath97 .",
    "this follows from the following _ coercive estimate _ : there exists a universal constant @xmath98 such that @xmath99    the estimate in is obtained via a contradiction argument , by taking into account of the finite - dimensionality of @xmath87 and the @xmath100-homogeneity of",
    ". then we decompose @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103^\\perp$ ] . in view of the inequality : @xmath104 we find that @xmath105 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath73 , which converges to some @xmath106 . then it is direct to check that @xmath107 , which leads to the claim in step @xmath100 .",
    "notice in passing that we have obtained the following decomposition of @xmath33 along @xmath32 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the topological direct sum of the banach spaces , with the summands being orthogonal with respect to the inner product on @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , note that only the _",
    "assumption ( op 2 ) on @xmath30 and @xmath31 has been used in step 1 .    from now on , @xmath32 is assumed to be surjective and with finite - dimensional kernel . in this step , we decompose each of the two sequences @xmath20 and @xmath110 into three parts : an @xmath30-free part , a @xmath31-free part , and a remainder in the finite - dimensional space @xmath87 .",
    "this is done via the _",
    "generalized laplacian_.    indeed , we define operator @xmath111 as follows : @xmath112 then , thanks to eq . and",
    "@xmath113^\\perp$ ] , we find that @xmath114 also has finite - dimensional kernel and closed range and , as in step 1 , @xmath114 can be assumed as surjective .",
    "denote by @xmath115 the canonical projection onto the first coordinate , which is a finite - rank ( hence compact ) operator .",
    "then our decomposition of @xmath20 and @xmath110 are given as follows : @xmath116 { \\bar{u}}= \\pi_1({\\bar{u } } ) + { s^\\dagger}a + { t^\\dagger}b , \\qquad & { \\bar{v}}= \\pi_1({\\bar{v } } ) + { s^\\dagger}\\tilde{a } + { t^\\dagger}\\tilde{b } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] for some @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "applying the _ algebraic _ condition ( op 1 ) of operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the inner products become : @xmath119 \\langle { \\bar{u } } , { \\bar{v}}\\rangle = \\langle \\pi_1({\\bar{u } } ) , \\pi_1({\\bar{v}})\\rangle   + \\langle { s^\\dagger}a , { s^\\dagger}\\tilde{a}\\rangle + \\langle { t^\\dagger}b , { t^\\dagger}\\tilde{b}\\rangle . \\end{cases}\\ ] ] owing to the compactness of @xmath120 , @xmath121 as @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , to conclude the theorem , it remains to establish @xmath123 which is the content of the next step .    to prove the convergence in , we start with the following two observations :    1 .",
    "the left - hand side of can be expressed in terms of the generalized laplacian : @xmath124 2 .   multiplying @xmath30 to @xmath125 and @xmath31 to @xmath126 in and invoking ( op 1 ) , we have @xmath127 so that @xmath128    now , as @xmath129 and @xmath130 are pre - compact by assumption ( seq 2 ) , it suffices to show the boundedness of @xmath131 in the norm topology of @xmath132 to reach the conclusion . furthermore , in view of the specific form of the expression involved in , it is enough to exhibit one particular representative @xmath133 in the co - set @xmath134 such that @xmath135 , where @xmath74 is independent of @xmath136 .",
    "as @xmath137 is uniformly bounded in the norm topology of @xmath85 , owing to the weak convergence of @xmath20 and @xmath110 assumed in ( seq 1 ) , the desired result follows from a standard result in functional analysis , which is claim @xmath138 in the proof of theorem 3.1 in @xcite .",
    "this completes the proof .    with the hindsight ,",
    "let us now explain the motivation for theorem [ thm_abstract compensated compactness ] and its relations with the earlier versions of the div - curl lemmas .",
    "consider a @xmath139-dimensional oriented closed manifold @xmath140 ( differentiable , or of weaker sobolev regularity , not necessarily riemannian ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath141 the space of differential @xmath142-forms on @xmath140 , @xmath143 the hodge - star , @xmath144 the exterior differential , and @xmath145 the tonic operator , _",

    "the `` orthogonality '' of _ div _ and _ curl _ in the sense of ( op 1 ) in theorem [ thm_abstract compensated compactness ] , which follows from the cohomological chain condition @xmath149 , @xmath150 , is a purely algebraic relation .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that a compensated compactness theorem with greater generality and abstractness is available .",
    "moreover , the hodge decomposition approach to the div - curl lemma initiated by robbin - rogers - temple in @xcite makes use of the laplacian @xmath23 on flat @xmath2 .",
    "if we take @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 with suitable localizations if necessary , the classical div - curl lemma ( lemma [ proposition : murat - tartar ] ) is immediately recovered .",
    "our generalized laplacian @xmath114 extends the flat laplacian and , more generally , the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath23 on manifolds , in view of eqs . .",
    "the fredholmness of @xmath23 follows from the hodge decomposition theorem , _ cf . _",

    "the analogous operator on semi - riemannian manifolds is not elliptic in general , so that theorem [ thm : geometric div - curl ] may not be extended directly to the semi - riemannian settings .",
