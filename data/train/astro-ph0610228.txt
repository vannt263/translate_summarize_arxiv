    "the event - rate history of supernovae ( sne ) , their progenitor systems , and the physical mechanisms behind these explosions , all have important implications for several branches of astrophysics and cosmology . as the primary sources of iron and other heavy elements , sne have a key role in the chemical evolution of the universe ( e.g. , nomoto et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the history of enrichment is determined by the rate of sne in the past and by the inventory of heavy elements that is released by each explosion . in cosmology , type ia sne (",
    "sne  ia ) used as cosmological distance indicators have provided direct evidence for an accelerated expansion of the universe ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 , 2004 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; astier et al .",
    "the use of sne  ia as standard candles relies on the assumptions that there is no evolution in their intrinsic properties , and that their luminosities can be calibrated through an unevolving empirical relation to their light - curve shape ( for reviews , see leibundgut 2001 ; filippenko 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "if these assumptions could be founded on more solid observational and physical grounds , the cosmological use of sne  ia would stand on a firmer footing .",
    "it is widely agreed that sne  ia occur when a white dwarf in a binary system is pushed toward the chandrasekhar mass limit and undergoes a runaway thermonuclear explosion . however , there is no consensus regarding how this situation is reached . in the single - degenerate scenario ,",
    "a white dwarf accretes matter from a main - sequence , subgiant , or giant star . in the double - degenerate scenario ,",
    "two white dwarfs merge .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how the explosion proceeds . since direct observational identification of a sn",
    "ia progenitor system is unlikely , indirect evidence may be the only practical way to distinguish between models .",
    "modeling of the observed spectra of sne provides many clues ( e.g. , nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) , as do studies of galactic sn remnants ( e.g. , badenes et al . 2006 ) . however , these studies mostly constrain the explosion physics ( deflagration or detonation ) and are less sensitive to the identity of the mass donor .",
    "a complementary approach exploits the fact that each of the above scenarios may predict a `` time delay distribution , '' which is the distribution of times elapsed between the formation of a stellar population and the explosions of some members of the population as sne  ia ( e.g. , yungelson & livio 2002 ; greggio 2005 ; frster et al .",
    "the time delay , in turn , convolved with the star formation history ( sfh ) , dictates the evolution of the sn rate with cosmic time or with redshift . by measuring the sn  ia rate vs. redshift @xmath12",
    ", one can , in principle , constrain the form of the time delay distribution and obtain clues about the progenitor scenario ( e.g. , pain et al . 2002 ; gal - yam & maoz 2004 ; strolger et al .",
    "2004 ; sullivan et al . 2006 ; barris & tonry 2006 ; neill et al . 2006",
    "; frster et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in practice ,",
    "there are several complications .",
    "a prediction of the sn rate is sensitive to the assumed sfh .",
    "for example , frster et al . ( 2006 ) recently re - analyzed the sn  ia sample of strolger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and argued that , by varying the choice of sfh within the uncertainties allowed by observations , a wide range of time delay distributions are consistent with the sn data , and hence none of the sn  ia scenarios can be ruled out .",
    "another complication follows from the recent evidence that sne  ia are descended from two distinct stellar populations ( mannucci et al .",
    "2005 ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; sullivan et al . 2006 ) , perhaps leading to two sn  ia `` channels ''  a `` prompt '' channel , with a delay time of order 1  gyr or less , and a `` delayed '' channel , with delay times that extend to @xmath16 gyrs .",
    "effectively , this means a time delay distribution that is more complex than those predicted by single - channel models .",
    "the combination of these two issues , combined with debates regarding sample completeness , have prevented conclusive determinations of delay times .",
    "measuring the sn  ia delay time in galaxy clusters , however , may provide a solution to these difficulties .",
    "analysis of the stellar population of cluster galaxies suggests that the sfh in clusters is simpler than that in the field , and can likely be approximated by a brief starburst at high redshift ( e.g. , wuyts et al .",
    "2004 ; holden et al .",
    "sullivan et al . ( 2006 ) show that the mix between the delayed and prompt components of the sn  ia population changes in different environments .",
    "the prompt component dominates late - type galaxies , while elliptical galaxies contain only members of the delayed group .",
    "sn rate measurements in clusters could then provide an estimate of the delayed component alone with minimal contamination . if the population of sne  ia is indeed bimodal , pinning down one of its components from cluster sn studies could help to disentangle the two populations in the field .",
    "furthermore , measurement of cluster sn rates may help resolve the question of the dominant source of the high metallicity in the intracluster medium ( e.g. , renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; maoz & gal - yam 2004 ) ",
    "sne  ia , or core - collapse sne from an early stellar population with a top - heavy initial mass function ( e.g. , maoz & gal - yam 2004 ; loewenstein 2006 ) .",
    "clusters are excellent laboratories for studying enrichment , due to their simple sfh and their deep potentials from which matter can not escape . therefore ,",
    "understanding the source of intracluster metals would be relevant for understanding metal enrichment in general , and the possible role of first - generation stars in early - universe enrichment .",
    "although sn  ia rates have been measured extensively out to @xmath17 ( pain et al .",

    "; blanc et al . 2004 ; dahln et al . 2004 ; barris & tonry 2006 ; neill et al . 2006 ) , there have been few attempts to measure the sn rate in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , barbon 1978 ; norgaard - nielsen et al . 1989 ; reiss et al .",
    "the only published cluster sn rate at distances beyond the virgo cluster is by gal - yam , maoz , & sharon ( 2002 ) .",

    "we are carrying out a program to measure the cluster sn rate at both low and high redshifts . in this paper",
    ", we derive the cluster sn rate based on a low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) cluster sn survey , the wise observatory optical transient search ( woots ) .",

    "in paper i , we present the observational details of woots , the sne that were discovered by it , and their followup observations . briefly , woots was a survey for sne and other transient or variable sources in the fields of 161 galaxy clusters , and was conducted in 1997 - 1999 .",
    "the cluster sample was selected from the catalog of abell , corwin & olowin ( 1984 ) , based on the following criteria : cluster redshift in the range @xmath29 ( based on the compilation of struble & rood 1991 ) ; declination @xmath30 ; abell richness class @xmath31 ( abell galaxy count @xmath32 ) ; and cluster radius ( estimated by leir & van den bergh 1977 ) smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "monthly dark - time observations used the wise observatory 1 m telescope , with a @xmath34 , @xmath35 pixel , tektronics ccd imager , giving a @xmath36 field of view .",
    "images were unfiltered ( see also   [ s.calib ] ) reaching a limiting magnitude equivalent to @xmath37 .",
    "images ( of @xmath38 clusters per night ) were compared with previously obtained template images using image subtraction methods , and searched for transients .",
    "all candidate transients were followed up photometrically at wise , and spectroscopically with larger telescopes .",
    "the determination of sn redshifts , ages and types was done by comparing the observed spectra to redshifted versions of high s / n template spectra of nearby sne , drawn from the spectroscopic archive presented by poznanski et al .",
    "in the course of the survey , 12 sne were discovered , all of them spectroscopically confirmed ( 11 as type - ia , and one as a type - iip sn ) .",
    "seven of the sne ( all of them sne ia ) were in their respective clusters , and the remaining five were foreground and background events .",
    "all additional transient / variable candidates were confirmed as non - sn events : asteroids , active galactic nuclei , and variable stars .",
    "the sn sample we will analyze in this paper does not include sn 2001al ( gal yam et al .",

    "a derivation of the sn rate from our survey requires knowledge of the depth of all the survey images , and hence a photometric calibration of the survey data in the observed bandpass .",
    "the woots images were obtained in unfiltered ( `` clear '' ) mode , resulting in a very broad , nonstandard photometric bandpass .",
    "we have determined the effective woots - clear bandpass by multiplying the quantum efficiency curve of the back - illuminated , lumogen - coated , tektronix ccd used in the survey , by the typical atmospheric transmission at wise observatory for the mean airmass ( 1.2 ) of the woots observations .",
    "we have verified that the effects of varying airmass and of mirror reflectivity vs. wavelength have negligible effect of the shape of the bandpass , the peak transmission of the effective woots - clear band is at @xmath40   , with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath41   .    to obtain the individual photometric zeropoints of all the woots images , we begin by using those images that fall within the coverage of the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss dr4 ; adelman - mccarthy et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we extract the sdss photometry of objects identified in each image and find the best fit to the sdss @xmath42 magnitudes from among a set of template spectra of stars ( with spectral types o to m ; silva et al . 1992 ) and galaxies ( kinney et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we then use the woots - clear bandpass to perform synthetic , vega - based photometry on the best - fit spectrum for each object .",
    "finally , we compare these synthetic magnitudes to the instrumental magnitudes of the same objects , defined as @xmath43 . the woots zeropoint is then defined as the median of the differences between the synthetic and the instrumental magnitudes of the calibration sources in the image .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter of these differences defines the statistical zeropoint error for each image .",
    "every source in an image can then be calibrated to a vega - based woots - clear magnitude by adding to its instrumental magnitude the derived zeropoint of the image .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of the zeropoints measured this way by adding the systematic uncertainty in the sdss zeropoints ( @xmath44 mag ) to the statistical zeropoint error determined for each image , as defined above ( typically also @xmath44 mag ) , resulting in a total zeropoint error of @xmath45 mag .    in order to calibrate the images that are in areas not covered by the sdss , we compare the instrumental magnitudes of objects in our images with their `` @xmath46 '' magnitudes in the usno-@xmath4 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) , to get an `` @xmath46''-based zeropoint .",
    "the usno-@xmath46 band has a similar effective wavelength to that of the woots - clear band , but is much narrower . from @xmath47 images in regions covered by the sdss",
    ", we measure a mean offset of @xmath48 mag between the vega - based unfiltered woots zeropoint and the @xmath46 zeropoint , and use it to calibrate the rest of the images .",
    "the scatter around this offset , @xmath49 mag , reflects both image - to - image scatter in the calibration process ( e.g. , due to variations in the mix of spectral types among the lists of calibration objects ) , and systematic errors in the usno-@xmath4 photometry .",
    "the photometric accuracy of usno-@xmath4 is not well determined , but @xcite estimate that the scatter in the photometric solution over the entire catalog has an rms of @xmath50 mag , consistent with our results .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath49 mag as the zeropoint error of the non - sdss images .",
    "these calibration uncertainties affect the overall uncertainty in the sn rate , through the determination of our search efficiency and the visibility time ( see   [ s.results ] ) .",
    "given a sample of @xmath51 sne discovered as part of a survey , the sn rate per unit stellar luminosity is @xmath52[eq.snr ] where @xmath53 is the effective visibility time ( or `` control time '' ) , i.e. , the time during which a cluster sn  ia is above the detection limit of the @xmath54th image , @xmath55 is the cluster luminosity within the search area in a chosen photometric band , and the summation is over all the survey images .",
    "we explain below our measurement of each of these variables in the present survey .      the effective visibility time , @xmath53 ,",
    "can be understood as the amount of time during which the survey is sensitive to sne in a comparison between two particular images of a given cluster .",
    "this quantity depends on the sn detection efficiency in each image , the sn light curve at each cluster redshift , and on the frequency of searches in the same field .",
    "we calculate the effective visibility time from @xmath56dt},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is an `` effective '' sn  ia light curve in the survey bandpass at the given redshift , as explained in   [ s.lc ] below , and @xmath58 $ ] is the detection probability as a function of sn effective magnitude .",
    "we describe below each step in this calculation .",
    "the detection efficiency of an image as a function of magnitude is the probability of detecting a sn - like point source in that image . in order to estimate the detection efficiency for a given field , we carry out simulations , following the prescription in gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . about @xmath59 fake sne are added blindly to each field , with a range of magnitudes , and with a spatial distribution that follows the flux of galaxies in the field .",
    "the simulated data undergo the same search procedure as the real data by means of difference image analysis ( see paper i ) , and the number of fake sne that are successfully detected in each magnitude bin is noted .",
    "the sn detection efficiency is usually close to 100% 12 mag above the detection limit of the image , and drops roughly linearly to zero over this range ( fig . [ fig.efficiency ] ) .",
    "we parametrize the efficiency curve with the function @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the vega - based magnitude of a sn in the effective bandpass of the survey ( see below ) , @xmath62 is the magnitude at which the efficiency drops to @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 determine the range of @xmath61 over which @xmath66 changes from @xmath23 to @xmath63 and from @xmath63 to zero , respectively .",
    "the main contribution to a slow convergence to unity at magnitudes brighter than @xmath62 is the difficulty of detecting sne which lie close to , or are superposed on , the nucleus of a bright galaxy .",
    "such cases are automatically included in our simulations when distributing the fake sne in the images .",
    "figure [ fig.efficiency ] shows four examples of the results of efficiency simulations , and the best - fit efficiency curves .",
    "the woots database consists of @xmath67 images , which were obtained under a range of observing conditions  atmospheric transparency , mirror reflectivity , sky background , and telescope image quality . as a result",
    ", the detection efficiency varies significantly among the images . since performing efficiency simulations in each and",
    "every image would be impractical , we have carried out simulations , as described above , for a subset of 30 images spanning a range in observing conditions .",
    "we then searched for correlations between the parameters of the resulting efficiency curves and various parameters that characterize each image .",
    "as detailed below , we found that the detection efficiency is primarily determined by two image parameters : the photometric zeropoint , which determines @xmath62 , and the number of residuals that are left in each difference image , with which the upper slope parameter , @xmath64 , is correlated .",
    "the lower slope parameter , @xmath65 , did not vary significantly among the 30 simulated images , and was therefore set to its mean value , @xmath68 .",
    "the sensitivity of each image to sne is determined by its photometric zeropoint , which combines the effects of detector quantum efficiency , variable mirror reflectivity , and variable atmospheric transparency .",
    "specifically , the zeropoint , @xmath69 , is an indicator of the limiting magnitude of the image , and therefore dictates the magnitude around which our detection efficiency drops rapidly .",
    "figure  [ fig_correlations ] shows the relation that we have found between @xmath69 and @xmath62 , @xmath70 , with a scatter of @xmath71 mag .",
    "the number of residuals , @xmath72 , was defined as the number of objects detected by sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in each difference image , with a detection threshold of @xmath73 above the background .",
    "a large number of subtraction residuals in an image can be due to several reasons .",
    "most often , poor subtraction occurs when the point - spread function ( psf ) in the image is very different from the psf in the reference image .",
    "this happens when the psf is distorted , e.g. , due to imperfect telescope tracking , or atmospheric refraction at high airmass .",
    "imperfect psf matching and poor image subtraction will mostly affect the cores of bright galaxies , decreasing the chances of detecting sne that lie close to galactic nuclei , and causing the efficiency curve to converge more slowly to the maximal detection efficiency .",
    "this behavior is parametrized by @xmath64 .",
    "we find that @xmath64 depends on the number of residuals through the relation @xmath74 , with an rms of @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_correlations ] ) .",
    "we found no significant dependence of detection efficiency on the remaining observational parameters ( sky background level and seeing width ) due to the fact that most of the images were obtained during dark time , and the seeing spanned a limited range of @xmath75 fwhm . based on the above relations , we can obtain efficiency curves for all images in the survey based on their measured observational parameters , @xmath69 and @xmath72 .      the peak magnitudes of sne  ia exhibit an intrinsic rms scatter of 0.20.3 mag , and are correlated with the shape of the light curve through a stretch relation ( phillips 1993 ; see leibundgut 2001 for a review ) .",
    "since more luminous sne tend to rise and decline more slowly than less luminous sne , their overall visibility time is longer than that of dim sne .",
    "sullivan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) study the dependence of sn  ia properties on host - galaxy type , and show that sne  ia in elliptical galaxies tend to be dimmer ( with a smaller stretch factor ) . in their fig .",

    "among the six cluster sne in our sample , the five with hosts were in early - type galaxies ( one of the sne was a hostless intergalactic cluster sn  see gal - yam et al .",
    "assuming that all the sne  ia in the clusters in our sample occur in elliptical galaxies , we use the distribution of stretch factors of sne with elliptical hosts to assemble a dataset of light curves that will serve as templates .",
    "we base these light curves on a rest - frame , non - stretched , @xmath4-band template light curve from @xcite , and transform it to different stretched light curves using the stretch relation , @xmath76,@xmath77 as described by @xcite . for consistency , we use the same non - stretched peak @xmath4-band magnitude and @xmath78 as sullivan et al .",

    "this uncertainty is taken into account in our error budget ( see   [ s.results ] ) .",
    "since woots observations were unfiltered , a transformation from the rest - frame @xmath4-band light curve to an observed woots - clear light curve at the cluster redshift is necessary . for each cluster , we calculate a set of stretched sn light curves from multi - epoch sn  ia spectra , using synthetic photometry , as follows .",
    "we start with a set of multi - epoch spectral templates from @xcite . for each combination of stretch and redshift ,",
    "we normalize the spectra to fit the @xmath4-band rest - frame photometry , and redshift them according to the cluster redshift .",
    "we then multiply the spectra by the woots - clear bandpass , to obtain an unfiltered light curve .",
    "the result is a set of representative woots - clear light curves for every cluster , each light curve with a different stretch .",

    "the detection efficiency function described in ",
    "[ s.efficiency ] is defined for the magnitude of a point source in a _ difference _ image .",
    "this means that the interesting quantity in the sn light curve is not its magnitude in a single image , but the magnitude corresponding to the flux difference @xmath84 that results from subtracting two epochs from each other .",

    "for example , when two closely spaced observations were compared to the same template , a sn that was discovered in the first observation ( at time @xmath88 ) would simply be rediscovered in the second observation ( at time @xmath90 ) . to avoid counting such objects twice in our calculation of the visibility time",
    ", we assign the second observation a reduced detection efficiency , which describes the probability of detecting only a sn that was _ not _ detected in the previous observation .",

    "we take this uncertainty into account in our error budget ( see  [ s.results ] ) .    to convert the observed magnitudes to rest - frame magnitudes , a k - correction factor was calculated for each cluster assuming that all the cluster light is emitted by elliptical galaxies at the cluster redshift .",
    "the net cluster flux was then translated to luminosity , according to the cluster redshift and the adopted cosmology .",
    "the faint cut on the galaxy magnitudes means that the summed luminosity includes only galaxies brighter than some limiting luminosity , which depends on the cluster redshift .",

    "we therefore applied the correction above after subtracting the luminosity of the bcg from the summed luminosity , and added the bcg luminosity to the corrected cluster luminosity .",
    "several recent studies have argued that bcg galaxy luminosities are underestimated in sdss , because the default sky subtraction algorithm removes the outer , low surface - brightness , flux from these galaxies ( graham et al .",

    "it is clear that bcg luminosity measurements from the sdss are indeed sensitive to the sky - level subtraction algorithm . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not certain that the new corrected measurements are in fact superior , e.g. , they might include in the bcg measurement some light from neighboring galaxies . we therefore choose to increase the bcg luminosities by 15% , with an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath144 .",
    "since the bcg luminosity typically constitutes about 6% of the cluster luminosity , this correction lowers our derived sn rate by 1% , and increases the systematic error in the rate by @xmath145 .",

    "combining all the elements of the calculation , as described above , we can derive the cluster sn rate and its uncertainty .",
    "the dominant source of error in the rate is the poisson statistics of the ( small ) number of sne , @xmath195 ( 68% confidence limit ) . to determine the propagation of the uncertainties in all the parameters and measurements that enter the rate derivation to the overall systematic uncertainty , we have conducted a monte carlo experiment , in which we calculate the sn rate many times , with the parameters drawn at random each time from their respective distributions .",
    "the distributions are either gaussian with an rms deviation set to equal the parameter error , or a specific measured distribution ( e.g. , the distribution of light - curve stretch factors ) . the distributions of sn rates from the monte carlo simulation permit both a reliable error estimation and a determination of the most probable rate .",
    "because of the nonlinear dependence of the rate on some of the parameters entering the calculation ( e.g. , stretch factor and luminosity ) , the most probable sn rate will not necessarily be the sn rate obtained from the combined most - probable values of all the input parameters .",
    "we will take as the most probable sn rate the peak of the monte carlo distribution , with a systematic error derived directly from this distribution , and a statistical error that originates from the poisson confidence limits on the number of events .",
    "we have also examined the sensitivity of the sn rate to the uncertainties in the individual parameters , by turning on the monte carlo simulation for each one separately .",
    "table  [ table.std ] summarizes the mean values and the uncertainty in the sn rate , due to each of the parameters . + * luminosity error : * the overall luminosity error is about @xmath196 , and is dominated by the process of randomly drawing the non - sdss cluster luminosities from the luminosity distribution of the sdss clusters .",
    "varying the cluster radius has a much smaller effect , of @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , the uncertainty due to the luminosity gradient of the clusters introduces an sn rate error smaller than @xmath197 . varying the inner radius of the background annulus results in an error of less than @xmath198 . + * visibility time error : * the uncertainties in the visibility time measurement have a less intuitive effect on the final rate distribution .",
    "the visibility time is most sensitive to the shape and parameters of the efficiency function , mainly @xmath62 , which is the magnitude at which the efficiency drops to half its maximum value .",
    "we find that drawing the efficiency parameters from normal distributions centered on their best estimated or mean values results not only in a dispersion in sn rates , but also in an overall decrease in the rate .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the dependence of the rate on the efficiency is nonlinear . a slightly higher efficiency ( caused by higher @xmath62 or lower @xmath64 ) will result in a decrease in the sn rate , and vice versa , but for a similar absolute change in the efficiency parameters , the decrease in the rate is larger than the increase in the rate .",
    "the same applies to the distribution of sn light - curve stretch factors .",
    "drawing light curves from a stretch - factor distribution , even if it is symmetric about the mean value , causes an overall decrease in the mean sn rate . in our case ,",

    "the stellar mass of each cluster is then estimated from the color - dependent stellar mass - to - light ratio derived by bell et al .",

    "finally , we define the stellar mass - to - light ratio of our cluster sample as the total mass divided by the total @xmath12-band luminosity of the entire sample , @xmath265 , and use it to convert the sn rate from snu@xmath246 to snum .",
    "the resulting sn rate per unit stellar mass is @xmath13   snum .",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the sn sample of cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to measure the sn rate per unit mass as a function of host - galaxy morphological type .",
    "they found a rate of @xmath253 ( converted from @xmath266 to @xmath267 ) snum for low - redshift ( @xmath268 ) e / s0 galaxies , lower than , but consistent with our result for cluster galaxies at a somewhat higher redshift .",
    "we note that some of the e / s0 galaxies monitored by cappellaro et al .",
    "are members of nearby galaxy clusters , and therefore the mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) local rate includes both cluster and field early - type galaxies .",

    "these estimates were based on the detection of one cluster sn in the low - redshift bin , and one or two in the high - redshift bin , and consequently , the errors are large . comparing to our measurement of @xmath3  snu@xmath19",
    ", there is a hint for a slow rise in sn rate with redshift .",
    "however , the data are equally consistent , given the large error bars , with a constant rate .",
    "more accurate sn rate measurements at high @xmath12 , which are in progress , will elucidate this question .",
    "we have analyzed the data from the woots cluster sn survey ( paper i ) to derive the sn  ia rate in @xmath0 clusters , normalized by stellar luminosity and by stellar mass ( table  [ table.snr ] ) .",
    "in addition to the sample of six cluster sne  ia discovered by the survey , our measurement required the determination of two variables  the survey visibility time , and the cluster stellar luminosities , which we determined using the survey data , assisted by sdss data .",
    "we have conducted monte carlo simulations that mimic the inhomogeneity in the parameters that enter the rate calculation , and quantify the dependence of the systematic errors on the uncertainty in these parameters .",
    "the resulting systematic errors are about an order of magnitude smaller than the poisson errors due to the small number of sne that were detected .",
    "we find that the sn rate is similar to the rate found in field elliptical galaxies , both locally and out to @xmath280 .",
    "a comparison to cluster sn rates at higher redshifts is similarly consistent with an unchanging rate , but the large uncertainties in current high-@xmath12 cluster sn rates can also accommodate a decline in the rate with time .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining cluster sn rate measurements at high redshift .",
    "the emerging dependence of sn rate on cosmic time and on galaxy environment should provide valuable new insights for astrophysics and cosmology .",
