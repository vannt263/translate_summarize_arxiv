    "the gilbert coefficient describes the damping of small - angle magnetization precession and is one of the key parameters that characterizes collective magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet .",

    "models of d - shell local moments that are exchange - coupled to itinerant s - p band electrons have , however , been resurrected recently because they provide a good description of ferromagnetism in many diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) , ( ga , mn)as in particular.@xcite exchange - coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons should also contribute significantly to gilbert damping in these new ferromagnetic systems .",
    "the elementary process for this damping mechanism is one in which a local - moment magnon is annihilated by exchange interaction with a band electron that suffers a spin - flip .",

    "we have attempted to employ theoretical analysis combined with existing experimental information to obtain the gilbert damping coefficient and to predict the scale of critical currents for spin - transfer magnetization - reversal in these systems . in spin - transfer induced reversal , damping of magnetization precession competes with current - induced spin torques and determines the scale of the current required to achieve reversal .",
    "our theoretical analysis examines the mechanism that we expect to dominate at low temperatures in high - quality samples , due to the coupling of the d - level local moments to valence band holes .",
    "we derive an explicit expression for the gilbert coefficient conventionally used to characterize damping in experimental studies , by comparing microscopic linear response theory with the linear response limit of the phenomenological landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations , and study how the values predicted by this model for the gilbert damping coefficient depend on the hole density and on the size of the mean - field exchange interaction experienced by valence - band holes in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "we find that the magnitude predicted for the gilbert coefficient , @xmath107 , is consistent with experiment , but that the observed dependence on the external field and magnetization orientation is larger than can be accounted for by this mechanism .",
    "the experimental fmr linewidth appears to have an inhomogeneous broadening contribution that is not included in our theoretical modeling developed for homogeneous bulk systems .",
    "the uncertainty that presently exists in the relative importance of these two broadening mechanisms could be reduced by frequency - dependent fmr studies .    in our view , the portion of the fmr linewidth broadening that is due to inhomogeneity should not , to a first approximation , be included in assessing the competition between spin - torques and spin - precession damping .",
