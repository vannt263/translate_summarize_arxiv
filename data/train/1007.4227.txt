    "for a thin bar or rod made of a kind of phase - transforming materials , and placed in an equilibrium state of uniaxial tension , the curve of the nominal stress and longitudinal strain is concave from small to moderate strains but strongly convex for large strains .",
    "this kind of phase - transforming materials have many applications and have been studied by many people ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is well - known that the system of conservation laws governing the dynamics of the elastic bar is hyperbolic for a standard material for which the nominal stress is a monotonically increasing function of the longitudinal strain , and is hyperbolic - elliptic for a typical phase transforming material .",

    "@xcite considered the impact - induced phase transition problem in a semi - infinite bar with a given velocity @xmath3 at the end . by using tri - linear approximation for the stress - strain curve",
    ", they constructed a two - wave solution involving a shock wave and a phase boundary .",
    "knowles @xcite studied the impact - induced tensile waves in a one - dimensional semi - infinite bar made of a rubberlike material .",
    "knowles showed that there are three regimes of response related to the loading intensity and for the impact of intermediate strength , under the hypotheses such as maximally dissipative kinetics or dissipation free kinetics , he selected the unique admissible solution among one - parameter family of solutions .    recently ,",
    "dai and kong @xcite used a fully nonlinear stress - strain curve instead of a linearized tri - linear curve in literature , and with the aid of the uniqueness condition on phase boundary derived by dai @xcite , they succeeded in constructing the unique physical solution of the initial- boundary value problem for the loading at all levels .",
    "in particular , for the intermediate impact velocity , dai and kong @xcite assumed that the two parameters in the stress - response function ( see ( [ 3 ] ) below ) satisfy @xmath0 , and based on this , they established the unique physical solution containing a centered rarefaction wave followed by a phase - boundary .",
    "they also pointed out that the characteristic speeds in the front- and back - states of the phase boundary are equal .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the initial - boundary value problem mentioned above for a kind of phase transforming materials .",
    "the inequality @xmath0 will be refined and replaced by another one and then all physically admissible solutions for all levels of loading are obtained completely .",
    "especially , for the intermediate impact , we also construct a physical solution involving a centered rarefaction wave followed by a phase boundary .",
    "comparably , the geometric character of this phase boundary exhibits a different manner .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the initial - boundary value problem modeling the impact - induced tensile waves in a semi - infinite bar made of a kind of phase - transforming material .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the establishment of admissible solutions for all loading at all levels .",

    "a particle at @xmath4 in the reference state is carried out to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the longitudinal displacement of the particle .",
    "hence the strain @xmath8 and the particle velocity @xmath9 are defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . to ensure the deformation is one - to - one , we suppose @xmath12 .",

    "the material of the bar is taken to be elastic so that @xmath21 , where the stress - response relation @xmath21 is assumed to be a @xmath22-smooth function .",
    "thus , the system ( [ 1 ] ) is hyperbolic - elliptic for typical phase - transforming materials for which the stress - strain curve generally has a peak - valley combination .    as in dai and kong @xcite",
