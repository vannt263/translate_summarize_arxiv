    "since the first systematic studies of random graph models by erds and rnyi @xcite , the relation between graph theory models and physics models , in particular statistical physics models , has attracted much interest .",
    "concepts and tools in graph theory have been applied to problems in physics , computer science , and biology to produce remarkable results .",
    "for example , feynman diagrams that are planar have special roles in the large @xmath0 qcd model  @xcite ; in causal dynamical triangulation , four - dimensional triangulated manifolds with fixed edge lengths , which can be viewed as a class of graphs , are used to construct spacetime on the planck scale to regularize the quantum gravitational path integral  @xcite ; statistical mechanical models of network growth can explain the connectivity of systems such as the internet  @xcite ; structures of amorphous solids can be quantified using graph theory properties  @xcite ; intracellular signalling networks can exhibit emergent behavior stored within biochemical reactions , including integration of signals across multiple time scales and self - sustaining feedback loops  @xcite ; neural networks can collectively and robustly produce content - addressable memories from partial cues  @xcite , indicating capacity for generalization , familiarity recognition , and categorization . added to these discoveries , a new collection of graph models has been proposed as candidates for emergent spacetime , as described below .",
    "a manifold can be approximated by a triangulation , which in turn can be viewed as a graph filled with simplices . from this observation",
    ", one can consider how a graph may give rise to a manifold ; i.e. from a family of graphs , following some constraints and obeying some set of rules for dynamical processes , is it possible that a manifold - like structure can emerge ? to be more precise , consider the possibility that a graph @xmath1 gives rise to a smooth manifold @xmath2 .",
    "a vertex in @xmath1 corresponds to a point in @xmath2 ; when a pair of vertices in @xmath1 are connected by an edge , the corresponding pair of points in @xmath2 have a certain distance @xmath3 .",
    "when the length scale under consideration is much larger than @xmath3 , @xmath1 resembles the smooth manifold @xmath2 . in such cases",
    ", one can say that the manifold @xmath2 , including its dimensionality , topology , and metric , emerges from the graph @xmath1 in the continuous limit .    from this general idea , in references @xcite , a graph model was constructed from a given graph hamiltonian , where it was proposed that the low - energy phase of the model may be interpreted as an emergent spacetime . in addition",
    ", it was found that when the edges of the graph possess a spin degree of freedom , the model could give rise to a u(1 ) gauge theory  @xcite . in @xcite , konopka has analytically and numerically studied the above graph model as a statistical model .",
    "a phase transition was found , where it was argued that the low - temperature phase can be related to spacetime only if the graph can interact with some matter degrees of freedom . in  @xcite , a related model , which in addition to graphs corresponding to spacetimes , also incorporates a matter field that resides on the vertices ,",
    "was proposed to study the role of matter in the emergence of spacetime from graphs . in @xcite",
    ", conrady has constructed a hamiltonian favoring low - temperature , two - dimensional manifolds through terms that explicitly favor two - dimensional triangulations ; for example , each vertex is favored to have 6 edges as in a triangular lattice , and tetrahedra are penalized .",
    "the model was simulated for small system sizes ( @xmath4 edges ) , which showed a heat capacity peak , and a transition temperature that decreased with system size .    in this paper , we also investigate a statistical model of graphs , in that the objects under consideration are merely abstract graphs , without any information on the positions of the vertices , or the lengths of the edges .",
    "a graph can randomly transform into another graph according to a set of transformation rules .",
    "graphs with given numbers of vertices and edges are considered , and they are governed by a hamiltonian that favors graphs with a set of local symmetries . if these local symmetries are preserved , the resulting graphs should be nearly triangulations of manifolds with a certain dimensionality , where the dimensionality is controlled by the ratio of vertices to edges .",
    "we are interested in whether any global structure of the graphs arises as a consequence .    because every edge in this model corresponds to a positive length @xmath3 ,",
    "only real positive distances can arise , so this model can only be used to describe riemannian manifolds ( i.e. , with positive definite metric ) .",
    "the metric of a riemannian manifold can be alternatively viewed as a distance function between any pair of points , which satisfies the triangle inequality . on a graph",
    ", there is also a natural notion of distance , namely the length of the shortest path between a pair of vertices .",
    "this distance is also positive - definite and satisfies the triangle inequality .",
    "thus on any graph , there is a well - defined distance function , as well as a corresponding geodesic .",
    "graph geodesics between two vertices are often highly degenerate , however , unlike the case for manifolds .",
    "if a manifold is to emerge from a graph , one expects that in the continuous limit all degenerate geodesics are close by , and the differences of their paths are only of order @xmath3 . after establishing this distance function between vertices , mapping",
    "the graph to a riemannian manifold is still a non - trivial problem .",
    "if we enforce that every edge is identical in that they have the same length when mapped to the riemannian manifold , then only for certain graph configurations will a riemannian manifold emerge from the graph .",
    "otherwise the system will be frustrated and unable to meet the condition of constant edge length , without increasing the dimension above that of the manifold that would emerge from the graph .    in this paper ,",
    "after reviewing the relevant graph theory preliminaries , we introduce a graph hamiltonian based only upon local symmetries .",
    "we evolve the graph under the monte carlo rules obeying statistical mechanical equilibrium , and we investigate whether a low - temperature manifold state emerges .",
    "we investigate the sharpness of the phase transition using energy as an order parameter for different size systems , and we discuss the likely first - order nature of the transition .",
    "we construct heat capacity curves as a function of temperature and investigate the transition temperature as a function of system size , which points toward a zero - temperature phase transition in the bulk limit .",
    "the haussdorf dimensionality of the emergent manifold is investigated and found to be an increasing function of system size , and approximately 3 for the largest system sizes we investigated ( 2000 vertices ) .",
    "correlation functions between defect - carrying vertices and edges are investigated to determine whether the effective potential between defects is attractive or repulsive .",
    "finally , we argue in analogy to condensed - matter systems that a nonzero phase transition temperature requires long - range interactions , and show that a coulombic - like term between graph vertices yields an apparently finite - phase transition temperature , but with a highly ramified manifold .",

    "( for example , the whole graph in fig .",
    "[ figdefs ] is an equilateral triangular lattice graph . )",
    "to gain intuition on the form of constraints and hamiltonians that may induce manifolds , let us construct some graphs resembling some manifolds , starting with the example of a flat two - dimensional plane @xmath42 .",
    "intuitively , any two - dimensional lattice graph as defined above forms a `` two - dimensional '' manifold , and a coordinate system of the manifold naturally inherits from the coordinates of the lattice graph .",
    "this is directly analogous to a bravais lattice in crystallography . _",
    "a priori _ there seems no decisive reason to choose any particular bravais lattice as the preferred graph configuration ; however , we shall choose the equilateral triangular lattice graph ( fig .",
    "[ figdefs ] ) , using the following argument . on @xmath42 , for any point @xmath43 and any distance @xmath44 , let @xmath45 denote the geodesic ball centered at @xmath43 with radius @xmath44 , and @xmath46 has the topology of a circle @xmath47 . for graphs , we can define the notion of `` geodesic ball '' similarly with that in riemannian geometry .",
    "let @xmath48 be the set of the vertices that have distance from vertex @xmath7 no greater than @xmath16 , including @xmath7 itself .",
    "for any two - dimensional lattice , if we denote the corresponding graph by @xmath1 , for sufficiently large @xmath16 , the induced subgraph @xmath49 $ ] also looks like @xmath47 topologically .",
    "however , for @xmath50 , namely the neighborhood subgraph @xmath51 $ ] , this property is no longer true for all lattices .",
    "for example , on the square lattice , @xmath31 is composed of 4 disconnected vertices . only for the equilateral triangular lattice",
    ", @xmath31 looks topologically like @xmath47 .",
    "thus in this sense , the equilateral triangular lattice graph is the closest analog to @xmath42 among all the two - dimensional lattice graphs , on all distance scales down to  @xmath3 .",
    "a graph can form a two - dimensional lattice for the correct ratio of edges to vertices . while a thermalized lattice in two dimensions is isotropic @xcite , the connectivity of such a lattice is still well - defined at low temperature .",
    "we thus choose to add defects in the form of extra edges or bonds , which will evolve under some hamiltonian .",
    "this allows bonded vertices to be permuted , so that the low - temperature phase is still a `` quasi - fluid '' that retains a symmetry corresponding to randomized graph connectivities .",
    "the extra edges induce defects in the lattice , which may be mobile .",
    "the exact shape of the defects and the reason why the defects are unstable or meta - stable depend sensitively on the hamiltonian .",
    "we shall construct a candidate hamiltonian , and test the stability of the defects by numerical simulation .",
    "this construction generalizes to @xmath52 straightforwardly : we can see that the defect - free lattice is the @xmath16-dimensional lattice as arising from a regular tiling of @xmath16-dimensional tetrahedra .",
    "the defect is a @xmath53-dimensional `` foam '' that divides the space into many patches of lattices with random orientations .",
    "we seek the simplest hamiltonian that can give rise to manifold - like triangulation graphs as classical solutions , which contain defects that facilitate graph permutation symmetry .",
    "we assume that the action is local , in the sense that it should be a sum over the vertices and/or edges , such that each term involves a finite number of vertices and/or edges within some cutoff distance .",
    "this condition is imposed because almost all physics models for which the hamiltonian or lagrangian is an integral of the corresponding density are local in the same sense .",
    "a defect manifests itself as a local structure containing vertices with anomalous valency .",
    "one obvious local property of manifold - like graphs is that all vertices not in any defects would have the same valency .",
    "moreover it is likely that vertices in the defects have just one more or one less neighbor .",
    "these properties can be enforced by a hamiltonian quadratic in the valency : where @xmath54 is the valency of vertex @xmath7 , and @xmath55 is a positive constant ( which will be taken to be infinite as described below ) .",
    "the average valency of the vertices is given by where @xmath56 is the total number of edges and @xmath57 the total number of vertices .",
    "note that , for example , @xmath58 is compatible with a regular equilateral triangular lattice , which in turn implies that the emergent manifold is two - dimensional , while @xmath59 is compatible with the face - centered cubic lattice , which implies a three - dimensional emergent manifold .",
    "thus without changing the form of the hamiltonian , we should be able to find manifolds with different dimensionalities by adopting different _ a priori _ values of @xmath60 . in the simulations described below ,",
    "we choose @xmath60 to be a non - integer , so that there exists an `` excess '' number of edges , which contribute to the presence of defects . because the total number of vertices and edges are fixed , the term in ( [ eqnh1 ] ) is minimized when every vertex has valency either @xmath61 or @xmath62 . in our simulations , @xmath55 is taken to be infinite and so is no longer an adjustable parameter of the model , and the corresponding term in is enforced to be minimal .    to obtain manifold - like solutions consisting of patches of close - packed lattices interspersed with defects , it is not sufficient to impose only the condition that each vertex has approximately the same number of neighbors .",
    "many regular graphs do not look like any manifold at all ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ figexotic ] ) .",
    "additional terms in the hamiltonian are thus required for manifold - like solutions .",
    "one candidate for such a term consists of particular subgraphs that can be embedded into the graph . from this viewpoint , @xmath54 is the number of @xmath63 subgraphs ( two vertices connected by an edge ) that go through the vertex @xmath7 .",
    "it is likely however that choosing more terms of this type will affect the dimensionality of the resulting spacetime .",
    "for example , if we incorporate terms that favor more @xmath64 subgraphs ( triangles ) and fewer @xmath65 subgraphs ( tetrahedra ) , then it can be expected that these terms would favor two - dimensional manifolds @xcite .",
    "as we hope to find a model that does not select the dimensionality at the level of the hamiltonian , we will not use any other term of this type besides @xmath66 .    a 6-regular graph that is not similar to any manifold .",
    "this graph can be viewed as an infinite rooted `` tree '' graph , in which each node has three children ( except the root node has four children ) , and every node of the `` tree '' is actually a tetrahedron . ]",
    "another property of manifold - like graphs is that around most vertices , the graph has a local discrete rotational symmetry that reflects the local isotropy of the emergent manifold .",
    "this can be restated as for each vertex @xmath7 , the subgraphs @xmath49 $ ] for most @xmath7 should have a discrete rotational symmetry . to reduce the number of possible hamiltonian terms",
    ", we impose this condition only on @xmath67 $ ] , which is also @xmath31 .",
    "we introduce the term where @xmath68 is a positive constant , and in which @xmath69 is the diameter of the subgraph @xmath31 , and @xmath70 is the radius of the subgraph @xmath31 . by the definitions of diameter and radius of graphs ,",
    "if the subgraph @xmath31 is not connected , they are both infinite . here",
    ", we additionally define that their difference @xmath71 is also infinite when @xmath31 is not connected .",
    "the term @xmath72 then enforces that all neighborhood subgraphs are always connected .",
    "when @xmath31 is connected , the difference between its diameter and its radius is a measure of its asymmetry .",
    "figure  [ fignbh ] shows several examples of neighborhood subgraphs .",
    "the eccentricity of every vertex in the subgraphs is labeled , along with the value of @xmath73 for each subgraph . for figs .",
    "[ fignbh](a ) and ( b ) , the @xmath31 s have a rotation symmetry of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , while figs .  [ fignbh](c)-(e ) are not rotationally symmetric .    in two dimensions ,",
    "a graph forms a triangulation of a surface if and only if all the neighborhood subgraphs are cycles  @xcite .",
    "when the degrees of the subgraphs are either 6 or 7 , which is imposed by the @xmath66 term , one can see from the examples in fig .",
    "[ fignbh ] that the @xmath72 term indeed favors cyclic neighborhood subgraphs , with only one exception shown in fig .  [ fignbh](e ) .",
    "we thus expect that , in this model , a graph with low energy is almost a triangulation of a surface .",
    "thus we propose the following model : consider a simple graph with @xmath57 vertices and @xmath56 edges .",
    "all the vertices are labeled , so isomorphic configurations with different labeling are considered to be different configurations .",
    "the hamiltonian is composed of two terms , as motivated previously :    because the hamiltonian is prohibitive to analytical solution , we implement a numerical simulation , as described in the next section , to study the equilibrium states of this model in the canonical ensemble , i.e. at a given temperature . in particular",
    ", we will be interested in the structures of the states with low energies , and the nature of the phase transition , if one exists , to these low - energy states .",
    "we sample equilibrium states in the model using a monte carlo simulation @xcite . the parameter @xmath60 defined in as giving the mean number of edges per vertex",
    "is taken to be slightly larger than 6 , which we expect will induce two - dimensional structures dictated by triangulations as described above .",
    "there is no fixed boundary on the graphs .",
    "the size of the graphs is specified by the number of vertices @xmath57 , and the number of edges @xmath56 . for convenience , in the following we use @xmath57 and the number of extra edges @xmath76 , to specify the size of the graphs . given the graph size ,",
    "the initial configuration is taken to be a randomly generated , connected graph .",
    "the graph is evolved in the canonical ensemble with temperature @xmath77 . in each monte carlo step",
    ", one end of an edge can jump from one vertex to another .",
    "we randomly pick an edge , and randomly label its ends by @xmath10 and @xmath7 . to find the new location of the edge @xmath13",
    ", we perform a random walk starting from @xmath7 as the origin , which does not pass through the edge @xmath13 ( this condition guarantees that a connected graph remains connected after such a move ) .",
    "the number of steps @xmath78 of the walk is a random positive integer chosen from the probability distribution @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a parameter between 0 and 1 ( we take @xmath81 below ) .",
    "denote the ending vertex of the random walk as @xmath82 .",
    "the edge is then moved from @xmath13 to @xmath83 .",
    "if the new graph is still simple , its energy is compared with that of the old graph , and this move is accepted or rejected according to the metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "each `` sweep '' through the system contains @xmath56 monte carlo steps , so on average each edge has one chance to jump in one sweep .",
    "such a method is ergodic ; moreover with this jumping scheme , the energy of only a few vertices is affected after each monte carlo step , and the energy of only these vertices needs to be updated .",
    "simulations are performed with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath81 , and various values of @xmath57 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . before showing the thermodynamics results from the simulations ,",
    "let us first describe the method that we used to render a graph from the simulations , in order to interpret its evolution .      to render a graph such that its structure can be best visualized , we need to devise an appropriate drawing scheme .",
    "a drawing of a graph maps vertices to points in @xmath52 with line segments connecting adjacent points .",
    "the following method is used to generate drawings in @xmath88 . for any drawing of a graph @xmath1",
    ", we seek to minimize the function where @xmath89 is the length of the drawing of edge @xmath8 , @xmath90 is the distance of the drawing between vertices @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the first term gives a preferred length for every edge , and the second term gives a repelling force to every non - adjacent pair of vertices .",
    "the function @xmath93 is chosen this way in order to make every edge have approximately the same length in the drawing , and as well , to make the drawing as expanded as possible . in practice , even for moderate - sized graphs , @xmath93 has numerous local minima and is difficult to minimize .",
    "we thus use another monte carlo calculation to search for its near - optimal values .",
    "initially , all the vertices are located at the origin of @xmath88 . in each monte carlo step , a randomly - chosen vertex is randomly moved to another position within the ball of radius @xmath94 , centered at the original position , and the new position has uniform probability distribution within the ball .",
    "after the monte carlo calculation , because the low - temperature configurations in the model are conjectured to be similar to triangulations of surfaces , we also search for all the @xmath64 subgraphs ( triangles ) in the graph , and render ( flat , solid ) triangles to fill the interior of the @xmath64 s .",

    "however , regions far away from them may not be affected by their existence ; i.e. , there may be no long - range correlation between such defects . in this subsection , we define and calculate correlation functions between defect pairs .",
    "because valency-7 vertices induce defects , we first measure the radial correlation function of valency-7 vertices .",
    "in general , the correlation between two random variables @xmath104 with expected values @xmath105 and standard deviations @xmath106 is defined as where @xmath107 is the expectation value operator . in our case , we take all pairs of vertices with distance @xmath108 in a graph ; @xmath86 is 1 if the first vertex in a pair has valency 7 , and 0 otherwise , and @xmath109 is defined similarly for the second vertex . then the correlation function",

    "[ figcorr](a ) .",
    "when the distance @xmath108 is very small ( @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) , the correlation function deviates from zero , because of the local structure of of the defects ( see fig .",

    "the correlation is very small , indicating the defects are uncoupled .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath108 , the correlation function becomes negative .",
    "this is because the valency of a vertex , and the distance from this vertex to other vertices , are not independent : compared with the valency-6 vertices , the valency-7 vertices tend to have smaller distances to other vertices .",
    "for example , for @xmath114 , the mean distance to valency 6 vertices is 7.18 , while the mean distance to valency 7 vertices is 7.04 .",
    "thus it is less probable to find two valency-7 vertices with a large distance , and hence they anti - correlate at large distances .",
    "the correlation function is quite small over a range of @xmath108 as one might anticipate , but the above global effect makes it difficult to quantitatively confirm that defects are decoupled at large distance .    as another measure of the correlation between defects , we can measure the radial correlation function of valency-3 edges , since their existence indicates deviation of the graph from a triangulation of surface .",
    "for example , every defect in fig .",
    "[ figdefect ] contains valency-3 edges .",
    "the distance between two edges is defined by taking the 4 vertices defining the two edges , and finding the pair of vertices with the minimum distance between them . since a pair of edges having a common vertex",
