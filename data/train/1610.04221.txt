    "in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , accretion of gas onto a central galactic supermassive black hole ( bh ) releases a large amount of energy across a broad wavelength range .",
    "the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this luminous accretion flow is shaped by the bh properties , as well as the structure and orientation of the infalling matter . interpreting the observed properties of agn seds as the result of known physical phenomena enables us to address key questions about these energetic objects .",
    "these include how the bh grows over cosmic time , the poorly understood mechanism by which relativistic jets are formed and driven , and the role agn play in their host galaxies , in particular with respect to feedback via winds and outflows , which are thought to contribute significantly to galaxy formation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "much effort has therefore been directed at researching agn through studies of their seds , both by acquiring better quality data , and developing increasingly advanced sed models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the optical - uv ,",
    "the sed comprises a ` big blue bump , ' which is broadly consistent with that expected from an optically thick , geometrically thin @xcite accretion disc ( ad ; see also @xcite , @xcite ) . at infrared",
    "( ir ) wavelengths , a significant contribution from a hot , dusty torus is observed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this structure offers an explanation for the dichotomy between type 1 and type 2 agn in the @xcite unified model , as the torus obscures the central engine from view in the latter class .",
    "the x - ray energy range is dominated by a power - law tail ( plt ) , thought to arise from inverse compton scattering by a hot , optically thin corona ( @xcite ) , with additional contributions by a hard x - ray reflection hump ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the so - called soft x - ray excess ( sx ) .",
    "the origin of the sx is uncertain ; it may be caused by further x - ray reflection off the ad ( @xcite ) , partially ionised absorption ( @xcite ) , or warm compton upscattering within the ad ( @xcite ) .",
    "a schematic of the different components that make up the agn sed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .    a number of properties of agn influence the observed sed .",
    "the matter that accretes onto the bh is net - neutral , so the bh has just two intrinsic properties  the mass ( _ bh ) and spin ( )  which primarily affect the peak temperature and mass - energy conversion efficiency in the ad . the rate of mass accretion through the ad ( usually given in terms of the eddington ratio , , where is the agn bolometric luminosity and @xmath3 is the eddington - limited luminosity ) and its orientation with respect to the observer ( @xmath4 ) can further modify the sed , and photoelectric absorption and dust extinction along the line of sight attenuate the emission over large wavelength ranges .",
    "_ bh can be estimated via a number of methods in agn .",
    "reverberation mapping ( rm ) uses the time delay between changes in the ionising continuum and the broad line region ( blr ) to probe the central potential , and estimate _ bh ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but this is an observationally intensive exercise .",
    "rm has allowed the calibration of the ` single - epoch virial mass estimation ' method , where broad line profiles and luminosity measurements from single spectra yield a ( less accurate ) estimate of _ bh ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of emission line and continuum measurement has been shown to be important , as some line profiles are shaped by effects such as outflows that make them susceptible to bias @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that @xmath5 can be estimated from spectral continuum measurements via so - called bolometric correction ( bc ) coefficients ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bh spin affects the radius of innermost stable circular orbit ( ) around the bh . for @xmath6 ( non - spinning ) bhs , ( where @xmath7 is the gravitational radius ) , but this decreases with increasing spin , so at @xmath8 ( maximal spin ) , @xmath9 .",
    "previous work has constrained , and hence , by fitting the profile of the broad , relativistically distorted , fe k@xmath10 emission line that is often observed in the x - ray reflection spectrum of agn ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "this method requires high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) x - ray data , limiting its application to nearby , bright agn ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this technique is contentious , as it requires an extreme x - ray source geometry to sufficiently illuminate the inner part of the ad ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternative models propose that the profile of the k@xmath10 line could be influenced by complex , multi - layered absorption , possibly from a disc wind ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    due to these uncertainties",
    ", attempts have been made to constrain the bh spin by fitting theoretical ad models to data .",
    "these models are generally based on the description by @xcite , with general relativistic , colour temperature and radiative transfer corrections applied ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "various modifications can be added , such as winds and outflows @xcite .",
    "these should be associated especially with high accretion rates , where photon trapping within the disc can also become important ( leading to a ` slim disc , ' @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however these models are not well understood ( @xcite ) , and are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used a thin ad model to constrain spin values in their sample of 39 agn at @xmath11 . using the numerical code of @xcite , and contemporaneous optical  near - infrared ( nir ) spectra from the vlt / x - shooter instrument , they successfully modelled the rest - frame optical - uv sed in all but two objects .",
    "the most massive bhs in their sample have the highest measured spin values , supporting a ` spin - up ' description of agn bh evolution , where prolonged unidirectional accretion episodes and bh mergers increase the spin of bhs through cosmic time ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite explored the spins of two low - mass , local agn  pg1244@xmath12026 and 1h 0707@xmath13495 respectively  by applying the done et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2013 ) sed model to multiwavelength data .",
    "they found that both objects were highly super - eddington if modelled with high spin values , implying that the underlying ad model assumptions break down .",
    "they argue that the disc is unlikely to radiate all the liberated gravitational energy , due to winds and/or advection , meaning that its peak temperature and luminosity no longer give robust constraints on spin .",
    "additionally , this means that it is unlikely the disc is flat , which is the geometry assumed in the derivation of bh spin from the fe k@xmath10 line @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also used sed - based arguments to probe the spins and assembly histories of bhs in agn .",
    "both works specifically focussed on inferring the accretion efficiency , @xmath14 , which increases with the bh spin .",
    "while @xcite found no significant correlation between _ bh and radiative efficiency ( and hence spin ) , @xcite did find such a relation , with most of the extremely massive agn in their sample having efficiencies corresponding to high spins .",
    "however , @xcite found that it is extremely difficult to accurately determine the efficiency via such means .",
    "the nature of the putative dusty torus is the subject of considerable debate .",
    "studies of the extent , composition and dynamics of this structure make use of spectrophotometric observations , and time dependent variability .",
    "previous work has found evidence that the torus could be ` clumpy ' in nature ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but this is as yet uncertain ( @xcite ) . of particular interest",
    "are the peak dust temperature in the torus , which can be used to infer its composition ( @xcite ) , and the total luminosity , from which the dust covering factor can be estimated .    in local agn , a remarkable relationship between the host galaxy and the central bh has been observed .",
    "these include strong correlations between _ bh and the stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy ( _ bh@xmath15 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and between _ bh and the bulge mass / luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . whilst local galaxies can be easily resolved in imaging , enabling structural decomposition of the point - like agn and extended galaxy bulge and disc ( @xcite , @xcite ) , disentangling these contributions is challenging at higher redshifts .",
    "@xcite partially overcame this limitation by using _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging of gravitationally lensed agn , and found evidence that at @xmath16 , the _ bh  bulge mass ratio is @xmath17 times that observed locally .    in our previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) we presented a means of systematically modelling the sed of a sample of 11 medium redshift ( @xmath18 ) agn , using multiwavelength spectral data from ir to x - ray wavelengths and a numerical sed code described in @xcite",
    ". in this sample , the redshift effect , and selection bias toward more massive agn ( @xcite ) that contain cooler accretion discs allowed us to sample the peak of the sed in five objects .",
    "this allowed us to make robust estimates of the agn bolometric luminosity ( ) , noting that in several objects the sx was unconstrained by the available data .",
    "we also found that the host galaxy starlight contribution to the sed peak was small , but may be non - negligible at longer wavelengths , in the rest - frame optical spectrum .",
    "it was necessary to model host galaxy attenuation in the form of dust reddening and photoelectric absorption ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend and examine the parameter space of our models . in each object , we consider the contributions of six emissive components to the total sed ; three components for the agn central engine itself , the host galaxy and dusty torus , and the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "we also consider attenuation by dust and gas in the milky way ( mw ) and host galaxy .",
    "we will :    * test the model properties , including both extrinsic effects ( host galaxy extinction curves ) and intrinsic effects , spin and the uncertainties on _ bh ( section [ sec : sedmodel ] ) . *",
    "carry out an analysis of the toroidal dust component , using mid- and far - ir photometry from _ wise _ ( section [ sec : torus ] ) .",
    "* consider the effects of variability in the optical spectra ( section [ sec : variability ] ) .",
    "* undertake an optical / ir spectral decomposition , using our refined models of the underlying continua , and compare results from this approach to earlier studies ( section [ sec : spec_decomp ] ) . + we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 throughout .",
    "we discussed several limitations of our modelling campaign in paper i , and begin this study by addressing these . in that work",
    ", we determined that for our data quality and coverage , using an sed model with intrinsic reddening / photoelectric absorption as free parameters was statistically justified .",
    "we also found that the data were generally good enough to determine the relative luminosities of the sx and plt , though could not independently constrain the detailed shape of the sx .",
    "we modelled the intrinsic ( host galaxy ) extinction using a redshifted @xcite mw extinction curve , with as a free parameter .",
    "we concluded that not all of the agn in our sample were well described by this model , a finding also noted by others . @xcite and @xcite found the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction curve to better describe host galaxy reddening in agn , whilst @xcite found the smc curve to be no better than that of the mw , or a simple power - law .",
    "@xcite opted to use an smc curve , but noted that the limited data coverage in the rest - uv made favouring any one model impossible .",
    "we therefore briefly explored using two alternative extinction curves  smc and large magellanic cloud ( lmc )  and found that the intrinsic extinction in some objects was better characterised by these . in this work",
    "we will use this as a means of refining our existing models .    throughout paper",
    "i we kept _",
    "bh fixed at values calculated from the profile of , using the method of @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that such single epoch virial mass estimates can be uncertain , and we have yet to explore the effect of changing _",
    "bh on , and other sed properties .",
    "this will be quantified in this paper .",
    "the estimated error on these _ bh estimates , arising from the dispersion in the method , is @xmath23 dex , with a smaller additional contribution from measurement errors . in practice , the dominant sources of error on single epoch virial _",
    "bh estimates are the uncertainties in the blr size  luminosity relationship and virial coefficient , estimated to contribute a @xmath24 dex total uncertainty @xcite .",
    "similarly , we found that data in all objects could be modelled by keeping fixed at zero ( non - spinning ) .",
    "this does not necessarily preclude higher spin values , so in this paper we will specifically test @xmath25 scenarios .",
    "finally , in many objects , we observed that the outer ad radius ( ) could be estimated from the sed fitting routine .",
    "however , we did not compare the values measured with the radius at which self - gravity within the ad becomes significant . here , we will test two other means of handling ; firstly by fixing it to the self - gravity radius , and secondly by fixing it to an arbitrarily large value .      in this paper",
    "we are primarily concerned with the nature of the underlying agn sed continuum . in paper",
    "i we described our sample selection , which focussed on the need for optical , nir and x - ray spectra . to make a reliable _ bh estimate , we required the broad balmer emission lines , and , to lie in the nir @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands .",
    "our primary sample was therefore at @xmath28 , and we included an additional object at @xmath29 which had the requisite data and and in the nir @xmath27 and @xmath30 bands .",
    "the objects names , positions , and other key properties are presented in paper i , and we retabulate the names and mass estimates from in section [ subsec : intred ] of this work .",
    "our data come from four observatories .",
    "the optical spectra were extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) databases .",
    "nir spectra for 7 objects were obtained using the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ; @xcite ) and an additional 4 objects from the @xcite sample had pre - existing spectra from arc s triplespec ( tspec ; @xcite ) instrument , kindly provided by yue shen .",
    "finally , x - ray spectra were retrieved from the _ xmm - newton_(@xcite ) science archive .",
    "we describe the data reduction in paper i. the optical / ir spectra are corrected for mw extinction using the dust maps of @xcite and extinction law of @xcite .",
    "we construct our sed using spectral data from all of these sources , following the same approach as in paper i. the optical / ir spectra include a number of emission features , with the underlying continuum dominated by the various emission components shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] . for all sed fitting , we thus define continuum regions ( free from emission line / balmer continuum / blended emission ) in the optical / ir spectra using the template of @xcite as a guide . the optical ",
    "nir continuum regions used are shown in table [ tab : cont_wav ] , with regions showing contamination by noise / emission features adjusted or removed accordingly .",
    "there is general consistency with other work that define similar such bandpasses , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some of these wavelength ranges have been adjusted by a small amount from those used in paper i , reflecting improved attempts to mitigate against inclusion of emission - contaminated ranges . in this section",
    "we do not include the continuum redward of ( regions 1015 in table [ tab : cont_wav ] ) owing to the ` red excess ' seen in this region .",
    "this region is discussed and modelled later , see section [ sec : torus ] .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is also known to show emission features , such as the previously mentioned fe k@xmath10 line , but the s / n of our x - ray data is not sufficient to resolve such features .",
    "we therefore use all available data from the mos1 , mos2 and pn detectors ( @xcite , @xcite ) of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) aboard _ xmm - newton_to maximise the number of x - ray counts .",
    ".optical / ir continuum regions used in the sed fitting .",
    "not all regions were used in all objects , as some showed contamination by emission features such as .",
    "we avoided oversampling any part of the spectrum , aiming for a roughly even spread of continuum points across the spectral range ( particularly with respect to regions 1015 ) . before section [ sec : torus ] ,",
    "only regions 19 are used for fitting , as regions 1015 begin to show potential contribution by hot dust and host galaxy .",
    "some of regions 1015 are used in for modelling in section [ sec : torus ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : torho_props ]    in paper i we discussed the potential contribution of the host galaxy to the total sed .",
    "this may be manifest in the ` red excess ' we observe in nearly all objects , redward of the emission line .",
    "the @xcite sample was at @xmath31 , and was therefore of lower average luminosity than our sample .",
    "as such , many of their agn exhibited significant host galaxy contamination in the optical spectral continuum . in general , for agn at @xmath32 the host galaxy flux is assumed to be insignificant ( @xcite ) , and indeed we concluded in paper i that for our least luminous source ( j2328@xmath121500 ) , the maximum possible contribution to the sed peak ( at @xmath33 ) was @xmath34 per cent , which increased to @xmath35 per cent at a wavelength of @xmath36 m .",
    "since this object also hosts the most massive bh of our sample , it is expected to exhibit the largest contamination by the host galaxy , based on the _ bh  bulge mass relationship ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we therefore concluded that the host galaxy contribution to the total sed continuum is small in all objects .",
    "nonetheless , the red excess and _ wise _ photometry show evidence for a dusty torus component , possibly including flux from the host galaxy . thus , as the final refinement of our sed modelling",
    "we now include sed components for both the torus and host galaxy , in order to fit the spectral data redward of ( regions 1015 in table [ tab : cont_wav ] ) , and the _ wise _ photometry .    in practice ,",
    "the torus is known to have a complex sed , comprising blackbody emission from the ( possibly clumpy ) hot dust , and emission / absorption from atomic / molecular transitions , including polyaromatic hydrocarbons related to star formation @xcite . however , due to data limitations , we will model the torus with only two blackbody components , hereafter referred to as ` hot ' and ` warm ' .",
    "the temperature of the hot component , @xmath37 , informs us of the composition of the dust grains that form the torus .",
    "silicate grains sublimate at temperatures above whereas graphitic grains can survive up to @xmath38 k ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this respect",
    "our approach is similar to that employed by @xcite , who modelled a single , hot graphitic dust component in a large sample of agn , and @xcite , who used blackbody models of the hot dust in their sample of agn .",
    "@xcite also modelled combined blackbody components to represent the warm and cold dust in their sample of luminous ir star - forming galaxies and agn .",
    "in paper i we tested two models of the host galaxy , that of a 5 gyr elliptical galaxy and a starburst galaxy ( represented by m82 ) with a stronger sed contribution at uv wavelengths .",
    "we extracted these galaxy templates from @xcite . practically , the difference between the two templates was small , as uv flux is dominated by ad emission .",
    "based on the _ bh  bulge relationship , we expect our sample of agn to be hosted by massive elliptical galaxies , and we will therefore use the 5 gyr template of @xcite only in this work .",
    "we fit the seds in xspecagain , fixing the x - ray part of the spectrum to values calculated in section [ subsec : intred ] .",
    "the full mid - ir to x - ray seds , including the torus and host galaxy components , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds_torus ] .",
    "we tabulate the key parameters in table [ tab : torho_props ] .",
    "dust covering factors are calculated for both the hot and warm torus components using the formula @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the luminosities of the hot / warm dust , and agn , respectively .",
    "in paper i we briefly discussed the possible causes of variability in our agn sample .",
    "since our multiwavelength data are collected non - contemporaneously , it is important to look for evidence of variability between optical and nir observations .",
    "we only identified such evidence in j0041@xmath130947 . in this case , for the sed fitting we normalised the nir spectrum to the level of the optical spectrum .",
    "we also presented all available optical spectra from sdss / boss , as five objects in our sample had optical spectra taken on multiple epochs . comparing these spectra",
    ", there appears to be some small ( @xmath42 per cent ) variability in three of the objects observed more than once .",
    "we examined the possible cause of these variations , using our sed model .",
    "there are few specific agn properties that can change on timescales of a few years ; _ bh and spin are fixed and changes in the mass accretion rate are physically limited by the viscous timescale  the characteristic time taken for mass to flow through the disc .",
    "this timescale for the bh masses in our sample is likely to be of the order of hundreds of years even in the innermost regions of the ad @xcite , although agn variability is frequently noted that occurs faster than the viscous timescale ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this could be due to reprocessing of sx emission in the ad , as plt emission is generally too weak to have a significant effect in most of our objects @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic reddening we model could change if the extinguishing dust is ` clumpy ' in nature , as is thought to be the case for the torus ( @xcite ) , thus presenting a constantly changing @xmath43(@xmath44)@xmath45 parameter .    in order to explore the effects of changing the obscuration",
    ", we take our best - fitting seds , and attempt to fit any other epochs of data available by adjusting only the @xmath43(@xmath44)@xmath45 parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] two examples of the variable agn are shown , together with models that result from changing @xmath43(@xmath44)@xmath45 . to first order we find that the variability we observe between observations could be attributed to changing extinction but the optical spectrum alone covers too short a wavelength range to test this hypothesis effectively ",
    "there are often only 23 emission free regions in the optical spectra to which we fit the sed model .",
    "a stronger test of the changing properties that are responsible for such variability would require simultaneous optical ",
    "nir data from multiple epochs , as this would provide the data coverage required to model the ad robustly .",
    "it may be that changes in the accretion rate must also be considered to fully parameterise the observed spectral variability .",
    "all such tests also require accurate flux calibration ; uncertainties in the sdss flux calibration may also contribute to observed apparent variability .",
    "our physical model of the underlying agn continuum now enables us to perform a complete decomposition of the optical  nir spectrum , including the contribution from the blr .",
    "the blr is thought to lie between the ad and torus ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , with electron transitions in partially - ionised gas giving rise to many emission features that are doppler - broadened by the rapid orbit of this gas around the bh .",
    "our sample is too small to improve on the emission line correlations extensively studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , however , since such studies generally use power - law continuum models , it is desirable to have a better understanding of the true continuum , especially as this continuum forms the basis of many virial _ bh estimators . in particular , the balmer continuum lies underneath the feature , but due to additional contamination by , this can be difficult to deconvolve , particularly when considering only a limited wavelength range on either side of the lines",
    ".    our spectral model will include models of the isolated emission lines , and a ` pseudo - continuum ' which includes blended line emission as well as true continuum contributions .",
    "the emission lines are modelled as superpositions of gaussians . whilst this is an approximation to the true emission line shape",

    "we are justified in our approach of using mw , lmc and smc curves .",
    "by allowing the dust composition to vary , we have made a logical extension to the modelling used in paper i. whilst some objects ( such as j1350@xmath122652 ) show evidence for a 2200   feature that is better fit by a mw reddening curve ( paper i ; a similar finding is shown in @xcite , their fig .",

    "@xcite used rm _ bh estimates for their samples of super- and sub - eddington agn , but estimated the uncertainty on these estimates was still a factor of @xmath86 , comparable to the single - epoch method .",

    "this could be statistical ( the error bars plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mgii_mass ] are likely smaller than the true intrinsic uncertainties ) , or it could be due to the specific relations we use to determine _ bh , which can be sensitive to the manner of the spectral analysis ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "using the relations of @xcite or @xcite may accentuate this effect even further , as those studies present even greater _ bh values from than @xcite .",

    "[ fig : specdecomp1 ] and [ fig : specdecomp2 ] ) suggests that addition of another gaussian component may result in an improved fit . if such a component is associated with a ` narrow ' region ( distinct from the blr ) , this results in a broader ` broad ' component , and hence a ( @xmath81 dex ) larger _ bh .",
    "however , given the extremely weak line , it is not certain whether such a third component should indeed be physically attributed to a separate region ; our data are insufficient to unambiguously determine its velocity width .      increasing the bh spin has a similar effect to lowering _ bh  both increase the peak temperature of the ad gas , extending the sed peak to higher frequencies .",
    "however , spin also changes the efficiency , so that the same mass accretion rate through the outer disc ( sampled by the rest - frame optical / uv spectra ) will produce a higher , as the disc extends closer to the bh . in our model , this affects the sx and plt as well as the ad , since these are assumed to be powered directly by the same accretion flow observed as a disc in the optical / uv .",
    "this is done via the parameter , which sets the radius below which the luminosity is used to power these soft and hard x - ray components , rather than being dissipated in a standard ad .",
    "thus the optxagnfmodel has a peak disc temperature which is set by , rather than by bh spin directly .",
    "increasing the spin means that there is more energy dissipated below , there is more energy to power the sx and plt .",
    "since the level of the plt is fixed by the x - ray data , this means that the fit generally adjusts to smaller values , leading to an increase in peak disc temperature compared to zero spin .",
    "this makes the ( rest - frame ) uv spectrum bluer , so the intrinsic reddening decreases to maintain the fit .    for low spin values ( @xmath88 )",
    ", these adjustments are minor and the fits are similar to those with zero spin . however , for higher spins ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 )",
    ", this has a large impact on the models , with the bluer uv continuum being very different to the observed continuum slope in a way which can not be easily compensated for by decreased reddening . in half of the sample , this produces a poorer fit to the data , but this is not true for all objects ; j0041@xmath130947 , j0043@xmath120114 , j1240@xmath124740 , j1350@xmath122652 , j2328@xmath121500 and j2332@xmath120000 all show reasonable fits ( @xmath91 ) for the @xmath92 model .",
    "the resulting fits are markedly poorer for the highest spin states ( @xmath93 ) , ruling these out from the optxagnfmodelling .",
    "a limitation in our study is that we have not considered the effect of ad inclination in our models .",
    "the optxagnfmodel assumes a constant inclination , @xmath4 , of @xmath94 to face - on , and geometric consideration of orientation dictates that a factor of two greater flux would be observed if the ad was face - on ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "larger inclinations than 60@xmath96 are thought to be less likely , as at some point the coaxial torus would obscure the ad .",
    "the effect of this on the sed peak frequency will be small , making this property extremely difficult to robustly constrain and practically , other sources of uncertainty discussed in this chapter dominate the uncertainty on .",
    "the disc inclination becomes significant in the case of a highly spinning bh . here",
    ", relativistic effects arising from the differential line - of - sight gas motion at different inclinations must be accounted for , as the simple trigonometric treatment of inclination is insufficient .",
    "it is therefore necessary to convolve a relativistic smearing kernel with the ad spectrum at each radius .",
    "this formed the basis of the model presented in @xcite that includes such relativistic treatment of the ad inclination  .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : agnf_vs_conv ] we compare models of optxagnf(no relativistic convolution ) with optxconv(which includes the relativistic convolution ) at high to maximal spin values .",
    "we normalise all models at a frequency of @xmath97 hz ( 3000  ) , as data constrains this part of the model , and they must all therefore pass through the same point .",
    "we show two different inclinations for optxconv , @xmath95 and @xmath94 , as the difference between the two models is strongest in the case of a face - on disc . due to this discrepancy in energy , it is possible that more of our objects could be compatible with high spin ( @xmath93 ) values than we concluded in section [ subsec : spin ] .",
    "therefore , we reproduced the high spin models described in section [ subsec : spin ] using optxconvat inclinations of both @xmath98 and @xmath94 .",
    "we tested spin values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , as both scenarios were ruled out in most objects when using optxagnf .",
    "we found that optxconvdelivers similar models to optxagnfwhen the inclination was fixed at @xmath94 ; either a good fit to the data is not achieved , or the sed energy is dominated by the sx and plt , in spite of the high accretion rates .",
    "this is counter to what is observed at lower redshifts ( @xcite ) , in which high accretion rate objects are generally ad dominated . in the face - on case",
    ", however , good fits to the data are obtained in 10/11 agn ( j1044@xmath122128 is the exception ) , even for @xmath1 .",
    "four of these agn still require a dominant sx and plt , however .",
    "we therefore highlight that models including full relativistic treatment of the disc inclination should be used to model highly - spinning bhs , as the difference in energy can be significant .",
    "however , as we have already noted some sources of potential degeneracy between parameters in our models , it is unlikely that a strong constraint can be put on the ad inclination by sed modelling alone .",
    "using this method to accurately measure the accretion rate , spin , inclination and intrinsic reddening values would require exceptional data coverage and quality . despite these uncertainties , our measurements of are more accurate than those in other studies that lack x - ray spectra , in addition to optical ",

    "the counter argument is that randomly oriented accretion episodes would result in @xmath101 approaching zero for massive agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative finding by @xcite suggests that prolonged accretion episodes spin up _ all _ supermassive bhs , whilst chaotic accretion results in only the most massive ( @xmath102 ) bhs having high spins , as a result of merger - driven growth .    using the results from optxagnf",
    ", we find our agn to be more consistent with having low to moderate spins .",

    "we can still conclude that the most massive agn in our sample are all compatible with hosting highly spinning bhs , whereas the least massive ( j1044@xmath122128 ) is not , but reiterate that there are several sources of degeneracy in the models .",

    "this is probably partly for the same reasons as discussed above  fewer gaussian components in the decomposition lead to less degeneracy  but additionally our sed continuum contains only one free parameter ( the normalisation ) , versus the @xcite approach , which uses power - law continua ( in some cases with a break included ) , with both normalisation and slope left as free parameters .",
    "@xcite used the @xcite data and models to directly compare results from performing a global decomposition with the ad model to those utilising local power - law continuum fits , finding the global approach to be more reliable .",
    "although our study is smaller , we have also shown that using our physical model of the underlying agn continuum facilitates a global spectral decomposition that is at least consistent with alternatives .",
    "since we attach a physical significance to this component , compatible with accretion physics and constrained by multiwavelength data from mid - ir to x - rays , this is a better justified approach , compared to the empirical alternatives .",
    "in this paper we substantially extend the study presented in paper i with a systematic analysis of the sed parameter space .",
    "a physically motivated agn sed model is applied to multiwavelength ( mid - ir  x - ray ) spectral data for 11 agn in the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "a summary of our work and key findings is as follows :    * we first refine the model described in paper i to include best - fitting intrinsic extinction curves , out of mw , lmc and smc models . *",
    "the eddington ratio ",
    "photon index relation of our refined model agrees with previous work .",
    "* we observe tight correlations between the uv bolometric correction coefficients and accretion rates .",
    "there is evidence for systematic offsets from the equivalent relation in a lower redshift sample , which we suggest is due to a higher average _ bh in our sample .",
    "x - ray bolometric corrections are less susceptible to this effect , but show a larger spread . *",
    "we next test the effect of uncertainties in the _ bh estimate on the agn bolometric luminosity ( ) . we find that in objects with well - sampled sed peaks , the difference is small , and in other objects , an uncertainty of @xmath81 dex in the _ bh estimate propagates through to a @xmath81 dex uncertainty on . * the effects of varying the bh spin",
    "parameter @xmath101 are explored .",
    "we find that spin values up to @xmath64 provide acceptable sed fits in 6 out of 11 objects ( and an improvement over the @xmath6 model in 3 ) , but that very high and maximal spin values of @xmath132 are ruled out by a combination of the optical  nir and x - ray data in all objects , with one exception .",
    "however , if we include relativistic treatment of the disc inclination , high and maximal spin values can describe the data in most objects , if the ad is face - on to the observer .",
    "there is degeneracy between the bh spin , inclination and mass accretion rate which make measurements of bh spin from continuum fitting uncertain . * the outer disc radii are well constrained in 8 out of 11 objects .",
    "they show good correlation with the self - gravity radius , but are smaller by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the disc break - up may occur closer to the bh than the self - gravity radius .",
    "* we model the red end of the nir to mid - ir ( @xmath133 m , observed frame ) using host galaxy and torus models .",
    "we find good agreement with previous studies for both the torus properties ( covering factor and temperature ) and the host galaxy ( luminosity ) .",
    "this is despite our more limited data - set in comparison with some of these investigations .",
    "we suggest that our approach to the sed modelling provides a viable alternative to structural decomposition of high - resolution images and those requiring observationally expensive mid - ir spectra . *",
    "our continuum model provides a firm basis on which to execute a spectral decomposition of the optical ",
    "nir spectra .",
    "the results from our approach are in agreement with previous studies that utilise empirical models of the continuum .",
    "we see a statistically significant anti - correlation between line strength and the agn bolometric luminosity .",
