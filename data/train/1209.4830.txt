    "spectropolarimetry , which is the study of the polarization properties of the light observed in spectral lines , is the most developed and widely used tool for retrieving the magnetic properties of the solar plasma and other astrophysical objects ( stenflo 2002 ; mathys 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the inference of the magnetic field vector from spectropolarimetric observations is performed through the inversion of the radiative transfer equation for polarized light ( del toro iniesta 2003a ; bellot rubio 2004 ; ruiz cobo 2007 ) .",
    "however , as the module of the magnetic field vector decreases , the observed signals disappear below the level of the photon noise , making the inference of the magnetic field very difficult and plagued with problems and uncertainties .",
    "this is , for instance , the case for the areas on the solar surface referred to as the _ solar internetwork_. here , the polarization signals are so weak that for a long time the internetwork was thought to be void of magnetic fields . + with the advancements in the sensitivity of the polarimeters and the higher spatial resolution of the observations achievable with adaptive - optic systems and large - aperture telescopes , polarization signals are now routinely detected everywhere in the internetwork ( lites et al .",
    "this demonstrates that these regions are truly pervaded by magnetic fields .",
    "unfortunately , the signals are barely above the noise level , thus it has not yet been possible to fully characterize the magnetic field vector in these regions .",
    "this has led to a long - standing controversy about the distribution of the module of the magnetic field vector in the internetwork ( domnguez cerdea et al .",

    "we reached this conclusion because when employing only vertical magnetic fields to synthesize stokes profiles , these could be retrieved as highly inclined ones due to the sole effect of the photon noise . since those tests were carried out with vertical magnetic fields , the linear polarization signals ( stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) were zero .",
    "this limits the validity of the tests , as the inversion code analyzes only linear polarization profiles featuring uncorrelated noise .",
    "it is therefore worth considering the case where small linear - polarization signals ( due to non - vertical magnetic fields ) can be hidden below the noise .",
    "this introduces correlations that could be employed by the inversion algorithms to retrieve useful information about the inclination of the magnetic field vector .",
    "this paper is devoted to addressing this particular situation . to this end , we employ uniform distributions of the magnetic field vector ( section  [ section : uniformpdf ] ) to produce a large database of stokes profiles . therefore ,",
    "unlike paper i , the resulting stokes profiles will have non - zero linear polarization profiles . after adding noise to these profiles",

    "our results are described in sections  [ section : discussion ] and [ section : correlations ] .",
    "section  [ section : conclu ] summarizes our findings .",
    "to study the effect of the photon noise and selection criterion , we performed several numerical experiments employing a probability distribution function that is parametrized by the physical parameters of a milne - eddington atmosphere ( me ) .",
    "these physical parameters are denoted as @xmath9    @xmath10 \\ ; , \\label{equation : x}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 refers to the magnetic field vector , @xmath4 is the so - called magnetic filling factor and denotes the fractional area within the pixel that is occupied by magnetized plasma , @xmath12 is the line - of - sight component of the velocity vector , and , finally , the vector @xmath13 considers all thermodynamic quantities ( source function , doppler width , and so forth ) .",
    "more details about these parameters and the milne - eddington approximation can be found in landi deglinnocenti ( 1992 ) and del toro iniesta ( 2003b ) .",
    "here we write the probability distribution function for the m - e parameters @xmath9 in the form + @xmath14    where the thermodynamic and kinematic parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , are assumed to be statistically independent of the magnetic ones @xmath11 and @xmath4 . the distribution function of the former parameters @xmath15 is the one obtained from the inversion of map a in borrero & kobel ( 2011 ) , so that we employ values that are representative of the quiet sun .",
    "the term that contains the properties of the magnetic field , @xmath16 , has been modeled as a slightly - modified uniform distribution , expressed as + @xmath17    which gives the probability of finding a magnetic field vector * b * whose module is between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , whose inclination ( with respect to the observer s line - of - sight ) is between @xmath0 and @xmath20 , and whose azimuth ( in the plane perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight ) is between @xmath8 and @xmath21 . on the right - hand - side of this equation",

    "in addition to the value of @xmath24 , we do not make any further attempts to employ a more realistic model for the solar internetwork since our aim is not to investigate particular distribution functions , but rather to study the effect of the inversion , photon noise and selection criteria in the inference of the magnetic field vector in a general way .",

    "the effective land factor of the atomic transition calculated under the ls coupling scheme is indicated by @xmath28 .",

    "this step is described in the next section .",
    "the stokes profiles for 6302.5  synthesized in the previous section are now inverted with the same vfisv code , but now running in inversion mode instead of synthesis mode . at the start",
    ", vfisv solves the radiative transfer equation for polarized light in the milne - eddington ( me ) approximation using a set of initial values for the physical parameters : @xmath30 .",
    "the solution of the radiative transfer equation yields theoretical or synthetic stokes profiles that are compared to the ones synthesized in the previous section ( those where photon noise had been added ) .",
    "the initial values of @xmath30 are then iteratively modified until the best possible fit between the theoretical / synthetic and observed stokes vector is reached .",
    "the final @xmath31 that achieves the best fit is then assumed to be the real one present in the solar atmosphere . in this work",
    "we will focus mainly on the magnetic field vector @xmath11 and magnetic filling factor @xmath4 . for more details about how the inversion is performed , additional free parameters of the inversion , and treatment of the filling factor",

    "( 2010 ) and borrero & kobel ( 2011 ; paper i ) .",
    "we note that , since we are using the same type of atmospheric model in the synthesis and inversion ( me atmospheres ) , the experiments carried out in this paper do not address the systematic errors introduced by the choice of the wrong atmospheric model , such as those introduced when inverting asymmetric stokes profiles using a me atmospheric model .",
    "+ once @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath4 had been retrieved from each stokes profiles of the original database , we applied two different selection criteria . in the first criteria , we select for the analysis profiles in the database where the maximum of the absolute value ( for all wavelengths ) in _ any _ of the polarization signals ( stokes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath7 ) is larger than 4.5 times the noise level max@xmath32 .",
    "this is equivalent to selecting pixels where the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath33 ) in the polarization profiles is 4.5 or better , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "hereafter we refer to this criteria as @xmath35 . in the second criteria we select those profiles within the database where the maximum of the absolute value ( for all wavelengths ) in the linear polarization signals ( stokes @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) is larger than 4.5 times the noise level max@xmath36 .",
    "this criteria will be referred to as @xmath37 .",
    "+ the reason behind the choice of these two different selection criteria is the following .",
    "the first criterion ( selection of profiles where @xmath38 ) was adopted so we can draw parallelisms with both the results presented in paper i and orozco surez et al .",
    "( 2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "owing to the intrinsic amplitude of stokes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath7 , this criterion selects mostly pixels where only the circular polarization @xmath7 possesses a @xmath34 .",
    "the actual percentages depend on the distribution of the magnetic field vector and the level of noise .",
    "for instance , taking a uniform distribution of @xmath18 , @xmath0 , and @xmath8 ( equation  [ equation : pdfuniform ] ) and considering a noise - level of @xmath39 , only 21.2 % of the profiles selected with the @xmath35-criterion possess linear polarization signals ( stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) with peak - values above @xmath40 . in the remaining 78.8 % of the profiles , only stokes @xmath7 is above @xmath40",
    ". the 21.2 % increases up to 39.1 % when considering a noise level of @xmath41 . in paper",
    "i , the maps that had equivalent levels of noise featured different percentages of profiles : in the map with @xmath42 , only about 8.8 % of the profiles selected with the @xmath35-criterion had linear polarization profiles above @xmath40 .",
    "this number increased to 38.8 % in the map with @xmath41 .",
    "as already demonstrated in that paper ( see also martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2011 ) , the inversion of profiles selected with the @xmath35-criterion yields values for the inclination of the magnetic field vector , @xmath0 , that are largely overestimated .",
    "this happens because most of the stokes profiles have linear polarization signals that are either below or close to the noise level .",
    "this effect decreases as the noise in the polarization profiles goes down so that the linear polarization signal rises above the noise .",
    "however , since both stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 remain below @xmath43 for transverse fields up to @xmath44 g , the overestimation in the inclination remains significant even at such low levels of noise .",
    "+ in paper i , we proposed , as an alternative solution , selecting for the inversion only pixels where the peak in the @xmath1 or @xmath2 signals is at least 4.5 times higher than the noise i.e. , where the @xmath33 is higher than 4.5 in linear polarization .",
    "we also followed this approach in applying the second criterion ( see also asensio ramos 2009 ) . in paper",
    "i , we anticipated that this approach has the advantage of retrieving more trustworthy values of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath18 but we did not quantify it .",
    "+ with the results from the selected profiles using the aforementioned selection criteria , we constructed histograms for the magnetic field strength @xmath18 , the inclination of the magnetic field vector with respect to the observer s line - of - sight @xmath0 , the projection of the magnetic field vector along the observer s line - of - sight @xmath45 , the projection of the magnetic field vector along the perpendicular direction to the observer s line - of - sight : @xmath46 ; azimuthal angle of the magnetic field vector in the plane perpendicular to the observer : @xmath8 , and finally the magnetic filling factor @xmath4 . results for @xmath42 and @xmath35 are displayed in figure  [ figure : highquv ] , whereas figure  [ figure : lowquv ] presents the results for @xmath47 and @xmath35 .",
    "likewise , figures  [ figure : highqu ] and  [ figure : lowqu ] present the results for these same levels of noise , respectively , but employing the @xmath37 selection criterion .",
    "the panels in each of these four figures correspond to the following histograms : * a ) * the component of the magnetic field vector along the observer s line - of - sight @xmath48 ; * b ) * the component of the magnetic field vector perpendicular the observer s line - of - sight @xmath49 ; * c ) * the module of the magnetic field vector @xmath18 ; * d ) * the inclination of the magnetic field vector with respect to the observer s line - of - sight @xmath0 ; * e ) * the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field vector in the plane perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight @xmath8 ; and finally * f)*-panels for the magnetic filling factor @xmath4 . in all panels , solid - black lines represent the initial distribution employed in the synthesis of the stokes profiles ( see eqs .  [ equation : pdf]-[equation : heaviside ] ) including all @xmath50 stokes profiles of the distribution . as required , the distributions for @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 are uniform ( equal probabilities ) .",
    "we note that this is not the case for @xmath51 and @xmath52 because the cosine and sine functions introduce non - uniformities in the distribution .",
    "in addition , dashed - black lines represent the original distribution of the physical parameters but considering only the profiles that are selected with corresponding selection criteria , namely @xmath35 in figs .",

    "finally , the solid - red lines present the distributions inferred from the inversion of the stokes profiles but employing the same stokes profiles that were used to construct the dashed - black histograms . in the following we comment on some general features that will assist us in interpreting our results :",
    "+    * the area under the solid - black curve is always one , while the area under the dashed - black and solid - red curves are both normalized to the quotient of the number of profiles selected with each particular criteria and the total number of profiles synthesized ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "therefore , one can interpret the difference between the solid - black and dashed - black curves as the loss of information caused by selection criterion , whereas the differences between dashed - black and solid - red are caused by the inversion algorithm .",
    "+ * if the solid - red curve lies below the dash - black one for a given interval of the physical parameter ( e.g. @xmath54 ) , it means that the number of stokes profiles that were synthesized employing that range of values ( e.g. @xmath54 ) are underestimated by the inversion .",
    "likewise , whenever the solid - red curve lies above the dash - black one for a given interval , the inversion overestimates the number of stokes profiles that were synthesized employing the range of values of the physical parameter given by the same interval . + * the area under the dashed - black lines in each panel increases as the noise level decreases . this can be realized by comparing figure [ figure : highquv ] ( @xmath42 ) with figure [ figure : lowquv ] ( @xmath41 ) , and also comparing figure [ figure : highqu ] ( @xmath42 ) with figure [ figure : lowqu ] ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this happens as a consequence of a larger number of stokes profiles fulfilling the requirement imposed by a given selection criterion when the noise is reduced . since the @xmath37 is more stringent than @xmath35 ( because linear polarization signals are usually much weaker than the circular polarization signals ) , the area under the dashed - black curves is of course much larger in figs .",

    "[ figure : highqu]-[figure : lowqu ] . +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in section  [ subsection : azimuth ] , we have seen that the retrieved distribution of the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight ( @xmath8 ) matches excellently well the original uniform distribution for the selected pixels . in the case of the @xmath35-criterion",
    ", this seems counter - intuitive since many of the selected stokes profiles only have sufficient signal in stokes @xmath7 , while @xmath1 and @xmath2 are usually dominated by photon noise .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the inversion does not properly infer @xmath8 but instead yields a random distribution of values owing to the lack of information in the linear polarization profiles .",
    "if this distribution happens to be uniformly distributed , then the inferred distribution of azimuths matches the original one , even if the inversion fails for each stokes vector individually .",
    "the second explanation is that , given that the number of profiles with large enough signals in stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 is non - negligible , the inversion indeed properly retrieves @xmath8 . in particular , in section",
    "[ section : inversions ] we mentioned that 21.2 % ( @xmath42 ) and 39.2 % ( @xmath41 ) of the profiles selected with the @xmath35-criteron , had linear polarization signals above the @xmath40-level .",
    "a final possible explanation is that the inversion is able to retrieve the correct values of @xmath8 even when stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dominated by noise .",
    "this could happen if the hidden signal introduces a sufficiently strong correlation in the noise , such that the minimization process can properly retrieve the azimuth of the magnetic field vector . to investigate which of these three possibilities are responsible for our results in section  [ section : discussion ] , we repeated the synthesis ( sect .",
    "[ section : uniformpdf ] ) and inversion experiments of the spectral line fe i 6302.5  , but employing the probability distribution function + @xmath55    which is very similar to equation  [ equation : pdfuniform ] with the exception that the distribution of the azimuthal angle is now a @xmath56-dirac centered at 22.5@xmath57 rad .",
    "this value is chosen such that @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , have the same amplitudes ( see eq .",
    "[ equation : wfa ] ) .",
    "the distribution given by equation  [ equation : pdfdeltaazim ] is employed to produce synthetic stokes profiles , which are then inverted after adding photon noise with levels of @xmath39 and @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting distributions , for both levels of noise and both selection criteria ( @xmath35 and @xmath37 ) , are shown in figure  [ figure : azimuth ] .",
    "+ figure  [ figure : azimuth ] shows that , on the one hand , the @xmath35-criterion ( solid lines ) has an almost uniform background distribution .",
    "this is caused by the inversion of stokes profiles whose linear polarization signals are so weak that they carry no information about the azimuth , thus the inversion retrieves random results that happen to be uniformly distributed . we know this because this background uniform field disappears if we apply the @xmath37-criterion ( dashed lines ) , which selects only stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles that are 4.5 times above the noise level",
    "this is therefore one of the reasons for the excellent results in figures  [ figure : highquv]e-[figure : lowquv]e .",
    "+ in figure  [ figure : azimuth ] , the @xmath35-criterion also features ( superimposed on the uniform background distribution ) a clear reminiscent signature of the original @xmath61 distribution ( indicated by the vertical black arrow ) .",
    "this indicates that the inversion code is able to retrieve , to some extent , information about the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field vector .",
    "however , we still do not know whether @xmath8 is correctly retrieved in only 21.2/39.2 % ( @xmath62 , respectively ) of the stokes profiles that have sufficient signal in the linear polarization or , whether the inversion can properly infer @xmath8 even when the linear polarization signals are below the 4.5@xmath63-level . to answer this question",

    "the distribution of @xmath8 obtained with this criterion ( dotted - dashed lines in figure  [ figure : azimuth ] ) shows an almost uniform distribution , with a far smaller peak at @xmath65 than before .",

    "we did not study whether the inversion code could retrieve useful information about @xmath0 from the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles that , in spite of being below the @xmath40-level , introduce a correlation within the noise . to study this possibility ,",

    "we found that the correlation introduced into the noise by these signals does not help us to retrieve the correct azimuthal angle @xmath8 . instead of the original @xmath56-function",
    ", the inversion code yields a random distribution of azimuthal angles that are uniformly distributed ( fig .",
    "[ figure : azimuth ] ) . in the case of the inclination of the magnetic field vector @xmath0 ,",
    "the inversion code is able to partially retrieve the @xmath56-function from the weak signals below the noise ( fig .",
    "[ figure : gamma ] ) .",
    "however , this is not the case when employing more general distributions , in which case the aforementioned systematic overestimation of @xmath0 , dominates the inferred distribution ( cf . del toro iniesta et al .",
    "+ we caution that in our experiments we employed only one spectral line , fe i ( @xmath27 ) 6302.5  , whereas in many previous studies fe i ( @xmath77 ) 6301.5  had also been analyzed . employing two spectral lines",
    "would certainly somewhat improve the results from these experiments as there would be more data points available to the inversion code .",
    "however , based on the results of orozco surez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , these improvements will likely be of second order compared to the systematic errors presented in this paper .",
    "+ an additional point of consideration refers to the numerical code used to infer the magnetic field vector from the inversion of the radiative transfer equation for polarized light ( vfisv ) .",
    "this code operates , with some modifications , under a levenberg - marquardt non - linear minimization algorithm ( borrero et al .",
    "we can not exclude that other numerical schemes such as genetic ( lagg et al .",
    "2004 ) or bayesian algorithms ( asensio ramos et al . 2008",
    "; asensio ramos 2009 ) are less affected by photon noise and therefore able to infer more accurately the distribution of the magnetic field vector .",
    "+    this research has greatly benefited from discussions that were held at the international space science institute ( issi ) in bern ( switzerland ) in february 2010 as part of the international working group _ extracting information from spectropolarimetric observations : comparison of inversion codes_. this work has made use of the nasa astrophysical data system .",

    "<S> in a previous paper , we argued that the inversion of stokes profiles applied to spectropolarimetric observations of the solar internetwork yield unrealistically large values of the inclination of the magnetic field vector ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because photon noise in stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are interpreted by the inversion code as valid signals , that leads to an overestimation of the transverse component @xmath3 , thus the inclination @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our study was based on the analysis of linear polarization signals that featured only uncorrelated noise . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop this idea further and study this effect in stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles that also show correlated noise . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we extend our study to the three components of the magnetic field vector , as well as the magnetic filling factor @xmath4 . with this , we confirm the tendency to overestimate @xmath0 when inverting linear polarization profiles that , although non - zero , are still below the noise level . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish that the overestimation occurs mainly for magnetic fields that are nearly vertical @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that a reliable inference of the inclination of the magnetic field vector can not be achieved by analyzing only stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , when inverting stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles below the noise , the inversion code retrieves a randomly uniform distribution of the azimuth of the magnetic field vector @xmath8 . to avoid these problems , we propose only inverting stokes profiles for which the linear polarization signals are sufficiently above the noise level . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approach is also biased because , in spite of allowing for a very accurate retrieval of the magnetic field vector from the selected stokes profiles , it selects only profiles arising from highly inclined magnetic fields . </S>"
