    "the spectral functions ( spfs ) of hadrons play a special role in physical observables in qcd ( see the examples in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lattice qcd simulations so far have difficulties in accessing the dynamical quantities in the minkowski space , because measurements on the lattice can only be carried out for discrete points in imaginary time . the analytic continuation from the imaginary time to the real time using the noisy lattice data",
    "is highly non - trivial and is even classified as an ill - posed problem .",
    "recently we made a first serious attempt to extract spfs of hadrons from lattice qcd data without making a priori assumptions on the spectral shape @xcite .",
    "we use the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , which has been successfully applied for similar problems in quantum monte carlo simulations in condensed matter physics , image reconstruction in crystallography and astrophysics , and so forth @xcite . in this report",
    ", we present the results for the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) and vector ( v ) channels at @xmath0 using the continuum kernel and the lattice kernel of the integral transform .",
    "the latter analysis has not been reported in @xcite .",
    "the euclidean correlation function @xmath1 of an operator @xmath2 and its spectral decomposition at zero three - momentum read @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a real frequency , and @xmath6 is spf ( or sometimes called the _ image _ ) , which is positive semi - definite .",
    "the kernel @xmath7 is proportional to the fourier transform of a free boson propagator with mass @xmath5 : at @xmath0 in the continuum limit , @xmath8 .",
    "monte carlo simulation provides @xmath9 on the discrete set of temporal points @xmath10 . from this data with statistical noise",
    ", we need to reconstruct the spectral function @xmath6 with continuous variable @xmath5 .",
    "this is a typical ill - posed problem , where the number of data is much smaller than the number of degrees of freedom to be reconstructed .",
    "this makes the standard likelihood analysis and its variants inapplicable @xcite unless strong assumptions on the spectral shape are made .",
    "mem is a method to circumvent this difficulty through bayesian statistical inference of the most probable _ image _ together with its reliability @xcite .",
    "mem is based on the bayes theorem in probability theory : @xmath11 = p[y|x]p[x]/p[y]$ ] , where @xmath11 $ ] is the conditional probability of @xmath12 given @xmath13 . the most probable image @xmath14 for given lattice data @xmath15",

    "the non - trivial part of the mem analysis is to find a global maximum of @xmath49 in the functional space of @xmath6 , which has typically 750 degrees of freedom in our case .",

    "the method works successfully to find the global maximum within reasonable iteration steps .",
    "to check our mem code and to see the dependence of the mem image on the quality of the data , we made the following test using mock data .",
    "( i ) we start with an input image @xmath53 in the @xmath54-meson channel which simulates the experimental @xmath55 cross section",

    "the variance of the noise @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 with a parameter @xmath62 , which controls the noise level @xcite .",
    "( iii ) we construct the output image @xmath63 using mem with @xmath64 and compare the result with @xmath57 . in this test",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath29 is diagonal for simplicity .    in fig.1 , we show @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for two sets of parameters , ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "as for @xmath34 , we choose a form @xmath67 with @xmath68 , which is motivated by the asymptotic behavior of @xmath42 in perturbative qcd , @xmath69 .",
    "the final result is , however , insensitive to the variation of @xmath70 even by factor 5 or 1/5 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath51 has been done by discretizing the @xmath5-space with an equal separation of 10 mev between adjacent points .",
    "this number is chosen for the reason we shall discuss below .",
    "the comparison of the dashed line ( set ( i ) ) and the dash - dotted line ( set ( ii ) ) shows that increasing @xmath71 and reducing the noise level @xmath62 lead to better spfs closer to the input spf .",
    "we have also checked that mem can nicely reproduce other forms of the mock spfs .",
    "in particular , mem works very well to reproduce not only the broad structure but also the sharp peaks close to the delta - function as far as the noise level is sufficiently small .",
    "to apply mem to actual lattice data , quenched lattice qcd simulations have been done with the plaquette gluon action and the wilson quark action by the open milc code with minor modifications @xcite .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath72 with @xmath73 , which corresponds to @xmath74 fm ( @xmath75 gev ) , @xmath76 @xcite , and the spatial size of the lattice @xmath77 fm .",
    "gauge configurations are generated by the heat - bath and over - relaxation algorithms with a ratio @xmath78 .",
    "each configuration is separated by 1000 sweeps .",
    "hopping parameters are chosen to be @xmath79 0.153 , 0.1545 , and 0.1557 with @xmath80 for each @xmath81 .",
    "for the quark propagator , the dirichlet ( periodic ) boundary condition is employed for the temporal ( spatial ) direction .",
    "we have also done the simulation with periodic boundary condition in the temporal direction and obtained qualitatively the same results . to calculate the two - point correlation functions ,",
    "we adopt a point - source at @xmath82 and a point - sink averaged over the spatial lattice - points .",
    "we use data at @xmath83 for the dirichlet ( periodic ) boundary condition in the temporal direction . to avoid the known pathological behavior of the eigenvalues of @xmath29 @xcite , we take @xmath84 .",
    "we define spfs for the ps and v channels as @xmath85 so that @xmath86 approaches a finite constant as predicted by perturbative qcd . for the mem analysis",
    ", we need to discretize the @xmath5-integration in ( [ ka ] ) .",
    "since @xmath87 ( the mesh size ) @xmath88 should be satisfied to suppress the discretization error , we take @xmath87 = 10 mev . @xmath89 ( the upper limit for the @xmath5 integration ) should be comparable to the maximum available momentum on the lattice : @xmath90 gev .",
    "we have checked that larger values of @xmath91 do not change the result of @xmath6 substantially , while smaller values of @xmath91 distort the high energy end of the spectrum .",
    "the dimension of the image to be reconstructed is @xmath92 , which is in fact much larger than the maximum number of monte carlo data @xmath93 .    in fig.2 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the reconstructed images for each @xmath81 in the case of the dirichlet boundary condition . here",
    "we use the continuum kernel @xmath94 in the laplace transform . in these figures , we have used @xmath95 with @xmath96 for ps ( v ) channel motivated by the perturbative estimate of @xmath70 ( see eq.([cont - v ] ) and the text below ) .",
    "we have checked that the result is not sensitive , within the statistical significance of the image , to the variation of @xmath70 by factor 5 or 1/5 .",
    "the obtained images have a common structure : the low - energy peaks corresponding to @xmath97 and @xmath54 , and the broad structure in the high - energy region . from the position of the pion peaks in fig.2(a ) , we extract @xmath98 , which is consistent with @xmath99 @xcite determined from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1 . the mass of the @xmath54-meson in the chiral limit extracted from the peaks in fig.2(b ) reads @xmath100 .",
    "this is also consistent with @xmath101 @xcite determined by the asymptotic behavior .",
    "although our maximum value of the fitting range @xmath102 marginally covers the asymptotic limit in @xmath32 , we can extract reasonable masses for @xmath97 and @xmath54 .",
    "the width of @xmath97 and @xmath54 in fig.2 is an artifact due to the statistical errors of the lattice data .",
    "in fact , in the quenched approximation , there is no room for the @xmath54-meson to decay into two pions .    as for the second peaks in the ps and",
    "v channels , the error analysis discussed in fig.4 shows that their spectral  shape \" does not have much statistical significance , although the existence of the non - vanishing spectral strength is significant . under this reservation , we fit the position of the second peaks and made linear extrapolation to the chiral limit with the results , @xmath103 for the ps ( v ) channel .",
    "these numbers should be compared with the experimental values : @xmath104 , and @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "one should remark here that , in the standard two - mass fit of @xmath1 , the mass of the second resonance is highly sensitive to the lower limit of the fitting range , e.g. , @xmath107 for @xmath108 in the @xmath109 channel with @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "this is because the contamination from the short distance contributions from @xmath111 is not under control in such an approach . on the other hand",
    ", mem does not suffer from this difficulty and can utilize the full information down to @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , mem opens a possibility of systematic study of higher resonances with lattice qcd data .",
    "= 8.2 cm    as for the third bumps in fig.2 , the spectral ",
    "shape \" is statistically not significant as is discussed in fig.4 , and they should rather be considered a part of the perturbative continuum instead of a single resonance .",
    "fig.2 also shows that spf decreases substantially above 6 gev ; mem automatically detects the existence of the momentum cutoff on the lattice @xmath113 .",
    "it is expected that mem with the data on finer lattices leads to larger ultraviolet cut - offs in the spectra .",
    "the height of the asymptotic form of the spectrum at high energy is estimated as @xmath114 the first two factors are the @xmath115 continuum expected from perturbative qcd .",
    "the third factor contains the non - perturbative renormalization constant for the lattice composite operator .",
    "we adopt @xmath116 determined from the two - point functions at @xmath117 = 6.0 @xcite together with @xmath118 and @xmath119 . our estimate in eq.([cont - v ] ) is consistent with the high energy part of the spectrum in fig.2(b ) after averaging over @xmath5 .",
    "we made a similar estimate for the ps channel using @xmath120 @xcite and obtained @xmath121 .",
    "this is also consistent with fig .",
    "we note here that an independent analysis of the imaginary time correlation functions @xcite also shows that the lattice data at short distance is dominated by the perturbative continuum .    in fig.3(a ) and ( b ) , the results using the lattice kernel @xmath122 are shown .",
    "@xmath122 is obtained from the free boson propagator on the lattice .",
    "it reduces to @xmath123 when @xmath124 .",
    "the other parameters and boundary conditions are the same with fig.2(a , b ) .",
    "the difference of fig.2 and fig.3 can be interpreted as a systematic error due to the finiteness of the lattice spacing @xmath125 .",
    "the statistical significance of the reconstructed image can be studied by the following procedure @xcite . assuming that @xmath46 $ ] has a gaussian distribution around the most probable image @xmath126 , we estimate the error by the covariance of the image",
    ", @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a functional derivative and @xmath129 is an average over a given energy interval .",
    "the final error for @xmath41 is obtained by averaging the covariance over @xmath33 with a weight factor @xmath130 $ ] . shown in fig.4",
    "is the mem image in the v channel for @xmath131 with errors obtained in the above procedure .",
    "the height of each horizontal bar is @xmath132 in each @xmath5 interval .",
    "the vertical bar indicates the error of @xmath132 .",
    "the small error for the lowest peak in fig.4 supports our identification of the peak with @xmath54 .",
    "although the existence of the non - vanishing spectral strength of the 2nd peak and 3rd bump is statistically significant , their spectral `` shape '' is either marginal or insignificant .",
    "lattice data with better quality are called for to obtain better spfs .",
    "we have made a first serious attempt to reconstruct spfs of hadrons from lattice qcd data .",
    "we have used mem , which allows us to study spfs without making a priori assumption on the spectral shape .",
    "the method works well for the mock data and actual lattice data .",
    "mem produces resonance and continuum - like structures in addition to the ground state peaks .",
    "the statistical significance of the image can be also analyzed .",
    "better data with finer and larger lattice will produce better images with smaller errors , and our study is a first attempt towards this goal .",
