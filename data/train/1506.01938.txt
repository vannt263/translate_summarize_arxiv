    "electronic transitions of valence electrons in atoms have typical energies of a few ev , whereas nuclear processes occur on the kev to mev scale . this large gap in energy scales",
    "reflects in the fact that the realms of atomic and nuclear physics barely overlap , but there are a few exceptions .",
    "one such exception is encountered in the nucleus of the isotope @xmath1th .",
    "this unique nucleus is believed to possess an extremely low - lying and long - lived excited state at an energy of a few ev , a property not found in any other known isotope @xcite . while direct evidence of the existence of this isomeric state is still pending @xcite and its energy has only been determined with large uncertainty ,",
    "the fascinating possibility to manipulate nuclei by laser light has spurred a wealth of proposals for various applications .",
    "the most prominent application of the @xmath1th isomer transition might be an optical clock based on this transition @xcite .",
    "this clock could feature a quality factor of @xmath2 , potentially outperforming today s best optical clocks @xcite .",
    "while such a clock might be highly immune to external perturbations , it would be very sensitive to variations of the fine - structure constant @xmath3 and qcd parameters @xcite , constituting an exquisite probe of possible drifts in fundamental constants .",
    "in further quantum optics applications , the isomeric state has been proposed as a primer for the field of nuclear quantum optics @xcite and as a robust qubit for quantum information @xcite .",
    "more generally , the unique case of @xmath1th might be the pioneer of gamma - ray lasers @xcite .",
    "the prerequisite for all of these experiments is an unambiguous proof of the existence of the isomeric state , a measurement of its energy , and a demonstration of its optical addressability .",
    "so far , most studies on @xmath1th employed high - resolution gamma spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "differencing schemes were used to indirectly determine the energy of the isomeric state .",
    "the latest measurement places the excitation energy at 7.8(5)ev , corresponding to a wavelength of 159(10)nm in the vacuum - uv ( vuv ) range @xcite .",
    "systematic errors of this measurement might be underestimated @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for the existence of an isomeric state has been obtained from collision experiments @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments were performed to observe the vuv - photon emitted during the decay of the isomeric state . to date , all of these measurements generated false results @xcite that were soon refuted @xcite , or null @xcite results .",
    "the lifetime of the isomeric state is expected to be on the order of 1000s @xcite .",
    "two experiments set out to measure the isomer lifetime via alpha spectroscopy @xcite and through gamma decay @xcite , but found no signal .",
    "a recent experiment claims observation of the vuv photon with an isomer lifetime of 6(1)hours @xcite , but is highly disputed @xcite .",
    "there exist a large number of strategies to populate the isomeric state .",
    "so - called `` indirect '' pathways include the alpha decay @xmath4 @xcite , excitation via higher - lying nuclear states ( e.g.  at 29.19 kev ) @xcite , electron bridge processes @xcite , and light fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "direct optical excitation of the isomeric state via a photon with the correct wavelength has not yet been successful , nor has the wavelength of the transition been determined with sufficient precision to commence spectroscopy with narrow - line lasers .",
    "spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation may fill this apparent gap @xcite",
    ".    optical spectroscopy of the @xmath1th isomeric transition requires a platform to securely hold the nucleus for a sufficiently long time in a recoil - free environment .",
    "radiation with a wavelength shorter than 196 nm ionizes the neutral th atom ( first ionization energy 6.32ev ) , experiments should therefore employ positively charged th ions for spectroscopy in the vuv .",
    "the extreme scarcity of the isotope @xmath1th , related to its half - life of @xmath5 @xcite , and the minuscule cross section for optical excitation @xcite , place further demands on the spectroscopy scheme .",

    "approach thus enables optical mssbauer spectroscopy and provides a very simple , robust , and secure way to store the @xmath1th nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) summarizes the relevant properties of the isomer transition .",
    "the long lifetime of the isomeric state can only be exploited if radiative @xmath11 decay into the nuclear ground state is the dominant pathway of decay .",

    "this requires the @xmath1th nucleus to be located at a well - defined lattice site , avoiding any coupling to the crystal s electronic states .",

    "pure caf@xmath0 is commonly used for uv optics , therefore some of its scintillation properties have already been studied .",
    "such studies found that self - trapped excitons ( stes ) are the dominant type of excitation created by various kinds of radiation @xcite .",
    "any form of ionizing radiation absorbed by the crystal will create highly energetic electron - hole pairs , which quickly thermalize to form a myriad of various excitations with energies below the band gap .",
    "these may transfer their energy to various kinds of luminescence centers , which eventually decay under emission of photons .",

    "the sensitivity at higher wavelengths , however , is not zero , but about 1/1000 of the peak sensitivity .",
    "pmts thus offer a certain degree of spectral filtering with a bandwidth of order 100 nm , which might be improved by uv filters . adding a spectrometer to the detection system offers spectral resolution down to below 0.1 nm",
    ", however the light throughput is fairly small , reducing the signal by typically five orders of magnitude .",
    "the reduced s / n often leads to long integration times and poor temporal resolution .",
    "studies in the vuv range are hampered by the fact that molecular oxygen absorbs light at wavelengths below 180 nm , therefore all experiments take place in an oxygen - depleted environment .",
    "we operate two vacuum systems : one is equipped with a vuv spectrometer and a deuterium lamp , the other one holds a set of different pmts and an excimer laser as light source .",

    "this measure reduces the rate of `` cosmic '' background events by a factor of at least 4 , consistent with literature values .",
    "given the long exposure times and large binning areas used in most measurements , however , the signal background is still dominated by `` cosmic '' events , both massive high - energy particles and gammas .",
    "we develop a reliable protocol to detect and remove such events in our data sets .",
    "the spectrometer is calibrated by a hamamatsu l1835 deuterium lamp , which is also used for illumination of the crystal .",

    "[ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the ste spectrum consists of nine overlapping lines , which can be approximated by gaussian functions . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , we plot the positions of the lines , where the wavelength @xmath33 has been converted into photon energy via @xmath34 .",
    "the dependence of photon energy on peak number is almost linear , suggesting that each line represents an oscillator state in the harmonic ste potential .",
    "the width of the lines is between 5 and 10 nm ( substantially larger than the instrumental resolution ) and decreases linearly with increasing energy .",
    "the position of the lines is independent of crystal temperature , wait time after illumination , light intensity , and emission spectrum of the deuterium lamp .",
    "their relative amplitudes , however , do change with wait time after illumination , and spectrum of the excitation source .",
    "notably , we varied the illumination / exposure time between 250ms and 10 hours and found only little change to the overall shape of the spectrum .",
    "we do observe a weak temperature dependence of the emission strength .",
    "between 20 and @xmath35c , the emission increases by about 60% in a near - linear fashion , but the relative amplitudes of the individual lines are unchanged .    it should be noted that stes are a well - known type of excitation in rare - earth halides @xcite .",
    "the vuv light might not excite the stes directly , but may induce various kinds of other crystal excitations , which quickly relax into stes .",
    "the magnitude of the excitonic luminescence appears to depend on the purity of the crystal , and therefore on the details of the crystal growing process . for our home - grown crystals ,",
    "the amplitude of luminescence emission varies by about a factor of five within a large set of home - grown specimens , irrespective of the doping concentration .",
    "we probe various commercial caf@xmath0 crystals ( hellma / schott lithotec and korth ) and find their vuv - photoluminescence to be a factor of at least @xmath36 smaller than for our home - grown crystals .",
    "a @xmath15th : caf@xmath0 crystal produced by the institut fr kristallzucht ( ikz , berlin , germany ) using the czochralski method shows negligible luminescence . we thus conclude that the emission amplitude depends only on the quality of the caf@xmath0 production process , with no discernable influence of the thorium doping concentration .    an absolute quantification of the crystal s photoluminescence in response to prior illumination with a well - defined light source is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we estimate that our home - grown 10 mm thick caf@xmath0 crystals , illuminated by a deuterium lamp with 200mw optical power for 30 minutes , radiate @xmath37 photons / s one minute after the end of illumination .          the decay of luminescence in caf@xmath0 on ns- and @xmath22s - timescales has already been studied extensively @xcite . in future spectroscopy and optical clock experiments",
    ", however , mechanical shutters have to be opened and closed in between crystal illumination and fluorescence measurement , introducing a delay of about 10ms .",
    "consequently , we limit our studies to timescales longer than 10ms .    an excimer laser at 157 nm is used to illuminate the crystal for one minute , and the subsequent luminescence detection is performed with a cs - te pmt . for detection times below one minute , we find a double - exponential decay with time constants @xmath38ms and @xmath39s ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) .",
    "these values change slightly with varying experimental parameters , but the significant difference in timescales prevails .",
    "the amplitude of the faster decay is at least 10-times larger compared to the slower branch . for times in excess of one minute",

    "this decay that can be traced for times as long as a full day ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "we fit the data by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an offset related to radioluminescence , and obtain an exponent @xmath42 at room temperature .    to conclude , we find that the ste spectrum in caf@xmath0 has an abrupt lower edge at 260 nm , and we observe no emission in the relevant spectral region around 160 nm .",
    "choosing pmts with cs - i or diamond photocathodes ensures maximum detection efficiency in the desired wavelength range and suppresses the luminescence background by at least three orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , a vast fraction of the luminescence decays on timescales much shorter than the expected isomer lifetime .",
    "these findings suggest that both temporal and spectral filtering can be used to discriminate the nuclear spectroscopy signal from crystal luminescence .",
    "the alpha decay of @xmath1th in the crystal is a violent process :  the alpha particle and the remnant @xmath43ra nucleus obtain kinetic energies of 5.1mev and 90kev , respectively .",
    "these fragments travel through the crystal lattice structure with ranges of about 30000 and 30 lattice constants , respectively , leaving behind a track of defects . from an energy point of view , each alpha decay releases enough energy to create @xmath44 photons .",
    "while most of the released kinetic energy @xmath45 is eventually converted into phonons , some of these defects relax via emission of photons , known as scintillation . as we will show later",
    ", each alpha decay in caf@xmath0 generates @xmath46 photons in the uv range .",
    "in addition , all the daughter products of @xmath1th down to @xmath47bi are short - lived ( half - lives between @xmath48s and 15 days ) , such that each @xmath1th decay is followed by a chain of four alpha and three beta decays .",
    "radioluminescence thus poses a considerable background for both the initial search for the isomeric transition , as well as future operation of an optical clock , where the background inevitably scales linearly with the nuclear isomer signal . in the following",

    "the rate of such events matches the @xmath1th activity inferred by neutron activation analysis and gamma spectroscopy .",
    "consequently , bins containing two and three of such events constitute features @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the figure .",

    "next , we sandwich the crystal in between two identical pmts .",
    "we observe the appearance of `` bursts '' always in coincidence on both detectors , again supporting the hypothesis that such flashes are related to alpha decay in the crystal .",
    "we calculate that each decay gives birth to @xmath46 photons , thus about 1% of @xmath45 is radiated via photons .",
    "we then exchange the @xmath1th : caf@xmath0 crystal for a @xmath15th : caf@xmath0 specimen .",

    "the fact that the main peak has shifted to a lower value of counts is explained by the reduced optical transmission properties of this specific crystal .",

    "interestingly , two separate peaks a and b are clearly visible , and we speculate that they correspond to two types of alpha decay with different values of @xmath45 .",
    "fitting simple gaussian distributions to the dominant peaks ( dashed red lines in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( b ) ) , we obtain a difference in released photon number of 27.8(6)% between peaks a and b. following the geiger - nuttall law , we assign feature a ( lower @xmath45 ) to the very long - lived @xmath15th isotope .",
    "the @xmath1th value of @xmath45 is 26.6% larger compared to @xmath15th @xcite , very close to the difference in observed photon numbers .",

    "an ancilla pmt , sensitive around 300 nm , would be used to detect alpha decays with high efficiency , thus recording the time stamp of every event . when post - processing of the data , any signal registered by the primary pmt during a @xmath22s time window around the alpha event would be excluded .",
    "the same could be performed already on - line with suitable gating scheme .      as a next step ,",
    "we measure the duration of the flashes at different crystal temperatures ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( b ) . between 0 and @xmath65c , the two extracted measures of the flash duration decrease by a factor of about 4 in a near - linear fashion .",
    "this speed - up is identical for @xmath1th- and @xmath15th - doped crystals .",
    "not only the duration of each flash , but also the number of contained photons is strongly temperature - dependent : the ratio of radiative to non - radiative relaxation of ste defects changes drastically around room temperature @xcite . recording histograms as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we find that the prominent peak shifts to the left for increased temperature :  for every alpha decay , fewer photons are emitted .",
    "more quantitatively , we measure the total emission of a crystal by integrating over time intervals of 10s , thereby detecting not only prompt emission following alpha decays , but also relaxation of long - lived defects and beta decays . such a curve , taken with a cs - te pmt right after annealing a @xmath1th : caf@xmath0 crystal at @xmath50c , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( c ) . between 30 and @xmath62c , the photon emission decreases exponentially with temperature , dividing in half every 24k .",
    "the apparent increase above @xmath35c is caused by black - body radiation emitted by the crystal heater .",
    "we perform the same measurement using a pmt with a diamond photocathode , for which the spectral sensitivity has a plateau up to 170 nm and gradually decreases towards higher wavelengths .",
    "the signal amplitude is drastically reduced , yet we find the same temperature dependence .",
    "this indicates that cherenkov radiation between 115 and 220 nm , which we do not assume to be temperature - dependent , comprises less than 1% of the photons emitted as a result of radioactivity .",
    "this agrees with the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , where negligible cherenkov radiation was observed .",
    "this finding is again important for future @xmath1th spectroscopy measurements : mild heating of the crystal to around @xmath62c reduces its radioluminescence by a factor of 10 from its room temperature value .",
    "in addition , the duration of characteristic flashes decreases dramatically , which in turn reduces the veto time imposed onto the primary detector to reject unwanted counts during radioluminescence flashes .      ionizing radiation can create semi - permanent defects in doped caf@xmath0 , exhibiting lifetimes of several weeks or months .",
    "such excitations , often related to contaminations or crystal defects , can be healed by heating of the crystal , allowing excited electrons to leave their traps and relax into the ground state by photon emission .",
    "this behavior is widely used in thermoluminescent dosimeters ( tlds ) based on caf@xmath0 .",
    "we allow a @xmath1th : caf@xmath0 crystal to accumulate long - lived defects for many weeks .",
    "heating the crystal to @xmath49c frees an enormous amount of photons . the spectrum , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , is markedly different from the one obtained with `` prompt '' photons .",
    "we observe a series of overlapping lines , where the position of the individual lines ( but not their relative amplitudes ) coincides perfectly with the photoluminescence spectrum .",
    "next , we use the single photon counting capability of pmts to access the absolute amount of photons radiated upon heating . measuring an ordinary glow curve",
    ", we estimate that for each alpha decay , a few @xmath36 semi - permanent defects are created in the crystal .",
    "these defects have a lifetime of months , and slowly relax under emission of single uncorrelated photons . these photons ( and not the pmt dark counts ) are the origin for the feature labelled `` 1 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( a ) .",
    "thus , for every alpha event , there are more semi - permanent defects created than prompt photons released .",
    "these `` delayed '' photons pose an unpleasant background to nuclear spectroscopy measurements , as they can not be excluded by a veto in the time domain . instead",
    ", periodic annealing of the crystal , e.g.  once a day , has proven to reduce the emission of uncorrelated photons by a factor approaching 100 compared to a crystal stored dark and cold for months .",
    "after annealing , the emission increases with an initial rate of @xmath66 photons/(@xmath67 ) at room temperature .",
    "note also that the onset of the delayed - photon spectrum appears about 40 nm towards longer wavelengths compared to the prompt - photon spectrum .",
    "this allows for more convenient spectral filtering with respect to the sought - after nuclear emission around 160 nm .",
    "we have measured the photoluminescence spectrum of caf@xmath0 upon irradiation with vuv light and , for the first time , resolved the substructure of the prominent ste feature .",
    "spectral filtering will allow to remove the luminescence background , which extends down to 260 nm , from the nuclear isomer signal expected around 160 nm .",
    "we have developed a consistent understanding of the radioluminescence emission , which comprises two components :  intense flashes of @xmath22s duration following a radioactive decay in the crystal , as well as a constant background of single uncorrelated photons emitted by very long - lived crystal defects .",
    "the spectra of these two components are strikingly different with lower cut - offs at 220 and 260 nm , respectively . the number of `` prompt '' photons can be reduced by a factor of 10 through a mild temperature increase .",
    "additionally , an auxiliary detector , sensitive around 300 nm , can be used to identify such events and thus provide the gating of a primary detector with peak sensitivity at the expected nuclear signal .",
    "the background of `` delayed '' photons can be removed almost entirely by periodic heating of the crystal .",
    "these findings can be used to optimize the protocol of future searches for the nuclear vuv photon using synchrotron radiation , and guide the selection of suitable photo detectors and optical filters .",
    "future work will include an absolute photoluminescence measurement using well - defined synchrotron radiation .",
    "understanding the reason for the large photoluminescence level in our home - grown crystals will allow us to improve the crystal growing process in this regard .",
    "considering mgf@xmath0 as a viable alternative to caf@xmath0 , we will assess the doping efficiency of th into mgf@xmath0 .",
