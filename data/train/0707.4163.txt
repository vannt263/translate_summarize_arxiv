    "the detailed knowledge of t - dependence of the real and imaginary amplitudes in pp and @xmath1p scattering is important for the study of the coulomb interference and the determination of the collision parameters . in general , the behavior of the real amplitude is oversimplified , with assumption that real and imaginary slopes are identical and that the ratio @xmath2 is independent of t. however , the present work , based on our analysis@xcite of the isr , sps and fermilab data , shows that the variation of the real amplitude in the coulomb interference region is very fast , with a slope about twice that of the imaginary part . the forthcoming experiments at rhic and lhc,@xcite",
    "respectively at 200 - 500 gev and 14 tev , make urgent the investigation of the structure of the amplitudes in the low @xmath3 region.@xcite    the real forward slope is obviously connected with the value of t at which this amplitude passes through zero .",
    "we find this connection , fulfilling the expectation from the theorem by a. martin@xcite that the real part has a zero that approaches the forward direction as the energy increases .",
    "our work covers the full t - range , obtaining also the zeros of imaginary amplitudes and the shapes of the dips in the cross sections of pp and @xmath1p scattering .",
    "we have constructed an accurate description of the t - dependence of the amplitudes , with smooth energy dependence in the parameters , with particular attention to the determination of slopes and zeros .",
    "the amplitudes have peculiar shapes as functions of @xmath3 , with approximate exponential behaviour only for very small @xmath3 , and then turning fast towards zero .",
    "the results for some energies ( 52.8 gev in pp , and 541 and 1800 gev for @xmath0p ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ ampl ] .",
    "theoretical arguments@xcite about the existence of a real zero close to @xmath4 at high energies are confirmed by our construction .",
    "the real pp amplitude has a second zero , while in @xmath1p only the first zero at small @xmath3 is observed.@xcite the pp case is drawn in fig .",
    "( [ real52fig ] ) , where the real amplitude at @xmath5 gev data is shown for small and for large @xmath6 , so that we can see where the second zero in the pp channel occurs .",
    "this second zero , being close to the zero of the imaginary amplitude , stresses the dips observed in the pp differential cross sections , but not those of the @xmath1p channel,@xcite due to a difference in the sign of the real tail .    with real and imaginary amplitudes described at low @xmath3 by exponential slopes ,",
    "we write for each channel , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the experimental slope @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 we determine separately @xmath11 and @xmath12 for each channel , and observe the approximate relation @xmath13 above 30 gev .    the exponential slopes at @xmath14 for 52.8 gev",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ ampl ] , right hand side , where we plot the pp amplitudes normalized to one at @xmath14 .",
    "we observe that the concept of exponential slope is limited to a small @xmath3 range , with strong characteristic curvatures of the real and imaginary amplitudes appearing very soon in the @xmath3 scale .",
    "it is remarkable that the imaginary amplitude has a positive ( going upwards ) curvature at the beginning , before it starts running fast to zero .",
    "these results for the slopes are shown in fig .",
    "[ br_bi ] .",
    "for @xmath12 we have a simple parametrization @xmath15 in @xmath16 , valid for both pp and @xmath1p channels , with a prediction @xmath17 for the lhc energy @xmath18 14 gev .",
    "the description is not so simple for the real slope . here",
    "the pp and @xmath19 cases are different at the lower energies , and an extrapolation to higher energies is not neat for pp . for @xmath19 , using the 541 and 1800 gev points , we guess a linear @xmath20 behavior @xmath21 in @xmath16 .    the role of @xmath22 in the determination of the collision parameters can be seen in the work of gauron , nicolescu and selyugin,@xcite who find a point @xmath23 where the real amplitude is compared to the coulomb part .",
    "they study pp scattering at 52.8 gev , suggesting a lower value for @xmath2 than 0.077 determined experimentally .",
    "however , to write the real amplitude at the matching point @xmath23 , they use the exponential factor @xmath24 with the experimental slope @xmath25 .",
    "however , according to our work , they should use the faster slope @xmath26 of the real amplitude .",
    "then the new value that they suggest for @xmath2 is not properly evaluated .",
    "a theorem by a. martin@xcite predicts that in pp and @xmath1p scattering the real part has a change of sign at a point @xmath27 which moves to the forward direction as the energy increases .",
    "the paper suggests real zeros of the form @xmath28 as we find with our description of amplitudes , as shown in fig .",
