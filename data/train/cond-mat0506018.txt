    "the study of cuprates at 1/8 doping attracted considerable interest since when , in the @xmath12 vs. @xmath14 plot of the first high-@xmath12 superconductor to be discovered , ( la@xmath15ba@xmath16cuo@xmath6 , lbco ) , a drop from 30 k to almost zero was found at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the search was extended to other cuprate systems with hole doping close to 1/8 @xcite , but up to now such a strong effect on @xmath12 has been confirmed only in the 214-systems , which include la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath6 ( lsco ) , lbco , ( la , nd)@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath6 ( lnsco ) , and la@xmath3ba@xmath18sr@xmath19cuo@xmath6 ( lbsco ) .",
    "they undergo a transition at a @xmath20 above room temperature , from the high - temperature tetragonal ( htt ) phase , where the cu - o planes have a square symmetry and the average tilting angle @xmath21 of the oxygen octahedra is zero , to the low - temperature orthorombic ( lto ) phase , with an average @xmath22 . in the 214-systems , for fixed hole - doping @xmath23",
    ", @xmath12 is strongly dependent from the cation composition and ranges from 1 to 33 k @xcite .",
    "the key parameter for understanding the @xmath12-drop in the 214-systems seems to be the disorder due to the inhomogeneous cation - size distribution in the cation layer .",
    "this allows a tilting of the cu - o octahedra up to @xmath24 , larger than in the lto phase , @xcite which triggers a structural phase transition at a low @xmath25 temperature .",
    "one finds different @xmath26 for different 214-systems , according to the cation - size distribution .    at @xmath25",
    "an electronic transition also occurs , which brings the system into a static charge - order ( co ) state , with very low @xmath12 .",
    "this effect was first observed in the cu - o planes of ( la , nd)@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath6 ( lnsco ) @xcite and , later , of la@xmath3ba@xmath18sr@xmath19cuo@xmath6 ( lbsco).@xcite the co state , from diffraction data , is in form of one - dimensional charge stripes .",
    "they act as charged walls which separate antiferromagnetic domains .",
    "the above scenario points toward an intrinsic competition between static , long - range co , and sc states .",
    "however , magnetic neutron scattering revealed a spin modulation with doping - dependent wavevector for any @xmath14 in lsco,@xcite much similar to that of lnsco @xcite and lbsco @xcite . these and other results @xcite suggest that i ) the magnetic phase separation related to the stripe state survives also when @xmath12 is not depressed ; ii ) that co instabilities may be a general feature of the cu - o plane , independently of the out - of - plane structure . in this scenario ,",
    "superconductivity may be suppressed in lnsco and lbsco by other factors peculiar to these compounds , like disorder , structural transitions or static spin order ( so ) @xcite , rather than by the charge order itself .",
    "this latter , in form of short - lived co fluctuations , might instead provide singular interactions between electrons , ultimately leading to sc pairing.@xcite    la@xmath3ba@xmath18sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 is the ideal system to observe the effect of the transition at @xmath25 on the electronic properties , and eventually detect fluctuating co in the vicinity of the high-@xmath12 state . indeed in lbsco , unlike in lnsco , the in - plane structural distortion can be finely tuned by an increasing ba @xmath27 sr substitution",
    ". therefore @xmath25 could be measured , by either x - ray and neutron diffraction , as a function of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "while 1/8-doped lsco remains in the lto phase at low t , all lbsco samples with @xmath28 show a low-@xmath29 structural transition with a @xmath25 ranging from 30 k at @xmath30 to 60 k at @xmath31 , as reported in fig .",
    "a detailed analysis of the diffraction patterns showed that the low - t phase is ltt for @xmath32 , the so - called low - temperature less - ortorhombic ( ltlo ) phase for @xmath33 .",
    "calculations based on the landau - ginzburg theory @xcite indicate that the lto - ltt transition is of first order , the lto - ltlo transition of second order .",
    "both co and so superlattice spots have been observed for any @xmath28 below a @xmath13 , also shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] , close to @xmath25 but not identical .",
    "in particular , the co diffraction spots are still observed above @xmath25 in samples with @xmath34 , to suddenly die out at @xmath35 for @xmath32 . in conclusion",
    ", the lbsco series shows a clear crossover at @xmath36 , both in the co and in the structural patterns .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath36 one also observes a drop in @xmath12 vs. @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ diag ] ) .",
    "since infrared spectroscopy features both fast probing time and sensitivity to dipolar excitations , short - range and short - lived co fluctuations are expected to affect the low - energy optical response . indeed , far - infrared peaks at non - zero frequency ( fip )",
    "do appear in the real part of the in - plane conductivity @xmath37 of lnsco@xcite with @xmath14=0.125 below @xmath25 , showing their relationship with long - range charge ordering .",
    "on the other hand , similar peaks are reported also in other cuprate crystals at low temperature , independently of the technique of growth or measurement.@xcite it is then reasonable to associate the latter fip s with sorts of charge ordering that may not be detected by diffraction techniques due to their short range , or short life , or both . in this respect ,",
    "most observations of far - infrared anomalies concern lsco , where such peaks were observed by several authors at energies below @xmath38 100 @xmath7 , although there is no general agreement about their domain of existence in terms of doping and temperature @xcite .",
    "this situation can be partly ascribed to the difficulties in measuring a reflectivity @xmath39 at very low energy , where conventional sources provide poor brilliance , and also to the need to extrapolate @xmath0 to @xmath40 = 0 for calculating @xmath41 through the kramers - kronig ( kk ) procedure @xcite .",
    "further information may be provided by a determination of the @xmath2-axis infrared response . above @xmath12 ,",
    "along the @xmath2 axis most superconducting cuprates behave as insulators , with @xmath42 in the sub - thz range . below @xmath12 ,",
    "josephson tunneling of the cooper pairs takes place between the cu - o layers , through the non - conducting cation layer , and @xmath43 jumps to 1 .",
    "therefore , the reflectivity change at @xmath12 is much sharper than for the @xmath1 plane .",
    "an analysis of this effect , called josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) , can provide information on the homogeneity of the charge system @xcite .",
    "however , due to the small condensate density along the @xmath2 axis , @xmath44 is attained at very low infrared frequencies , such as 15 @xmath7 for lsco with @xmath23 or 6 @xmath7 for optimally doped bscco @xcite .",
    "one thus faces again the poor brilliance of conventional infrared sources below 20 @xmath7 .    in the present work we have measured both the @xmath43 and the @xmath45 of la@xmath3ba@xmath18sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 down to 5 @xmath7",
    "this makes negligible the interval where the reflectivity is extrapolated and - if a far - infrared anomaly ( fip ) related to co does exist - it should allow one to obtain data on both its sides . to do that we have used , in the sub - thz interval from 5 to 30 @xmath7 , coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) provided by a bending magnet of the storage ring bessy",
    "when working at a current of 10 - 20 ma in the so - called low-@xmath46 mode @xcite , it provides an intensity more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of a conventional mercury lamp , over a continuous spectrum suitable for standard fourier - transform spectroscopy ( ft - ir ) .",
    "we selected two single crystals of lbsco with the same hole doping ( as confirmed by their spectral weight , see below ) @xmath14 = 0.125 , but with different ba concentrations .",
    "the one with @xmath8 = 0.05 and @xmath12 = 10 k was in the ltt phase below @xmath25 = 40 k and exhibited static co below @xmath47 , both in x - ray @xcite and neutron @xcite diffraction spectra .",
    "the other one , with @xmath8 = 0.085 and @xmath12 = 31 k , was in the ltlo phase below @xmath48 k , but showed co superlattice spots below a @xmath49 50 k @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath51 sample the co signal was detected in the x - ray pattern only , not in the neutron pattern . since in the x - ray experiment inelastic scattering",
    "can also occur , this fact was interpreted by the authors @xcite as indication of co fluctuations , in the absence of static co , consistently with the second - order transition scenario .",
    "the aim of this work is therefore to monitor the effect of the crossover between static and fluctuating co states on the low - energy electrodynamics of a cuprate .",
    "single crystal rods of lbsco were grown by the travelling - solvent floating - zone method and fully characterized as described in ref . .",
    "they were cut to produce both @xmath1 and @xmath52 facets of about 8x5 mm and 5x5 mm respectively .",
    "the absence of mosaicity and the facet orientation with respect to crystal axes were checked by simultaneous x - ray diffraction and optical reflection measurements @xcite .",
    "the dc resistivity @xmath53 of the @xmath1 facet , measured by a standard four - points probe , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ resist ] .",
    "the @xmath12 thus determined is consistent with that determined from the magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the upturn at low-@xmath29 in the @xmath54 sample is often observed in 214-systems displaying co , such as lnsco @xcite .",
    "the quasi - linear increase at higher @xmath29 s and the absolute values of @xmath55 in both samples are consistent with previous data on lsco with @xmath14 = 0.12 @xcite .",
    "the reflectivity @xmath45 was measured at quasi - normal incidence ( 8@xmath56 ) from 5 k to 295 k. in order to avoid any @xmath2-axis leakage in the determination of @xmath45 , the electric field was @xmath57-polarized along the @xmath58 axis of the @xmath1 facet @xcite .",
    "it was then aligned along @xmath2 onto the @xmath52 facet to determine @xmath43 .",
    "the interval 20 @xmath59 20000 @xmath7 was studied with conventional sources , the sub - thz range between 5 and 30 @xmath7 by csr and by a dedicated bolometer working at 1.3 k. the @xmath1-plane spectra were recorded with a beam current in the storage ring of 10 - 20 ma , in a regime of maximum available signal - to - noise ratio , while the @xmath2-axis data were obtained with a beam current of about 30 ma , in a regime where the intensity of the radiation is maximized ( see below ) .",
    "the minimum frequency was limited in both cases to 5 @xmath7 by diffraction effects from the elements of the reflectivity setup .",
    "the reference was a gold ( silver ) film below ( above ) 12000 @xmath7 evaporated _ in situ _ onto the sample .",
    "the excellent opportunities offered by csr as a source for fourier - transform spectroscopy were shown and reported previously @xcite . however , in the present work we could take advantage of several recent improvements in the csr photon beam quality , of crucial importance for the present work .",
    "the deviations of @xmath45 from the normal metallic behavior reported in fig .",
    "[ rifab ] , which originate the fip discussed in the present paper , are of the order of 1 % of the @xmath45 value at the same @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore important to briefly discuss the capability of the csr source to reach the requested level of accuracy .",
    "csr can be affected by time - dependent effects , mainly due to instabilities in the spatial distribution of the electrons in the bunches .",
    "time - dependent effects on the millisecond time scale may affect the baseline of the ft - ir interferograms , therefore leading to poor reproducibility in the ft - ir spectra @xcite .",
    "in the low-@xmath46 mode developed at bessy the electron beam instabilities have been strongly reduced by using a beam feedback system , up to stored current of about 20 ma . on the other hand , such electron beam instabilities are eventually present when the beam current is raised above 30 ma , as it was the case for the data in fig .",
    "however in the case of the @xmath2 axis response , the noise in the spectra does not appreciably affect the experiment .",
    "the reproducibility of an infrared setup is usually defined as the frequency - dependent ratio between two subsequent spectra @xmath60 ( also called 100 % line ) .",
    "the @xmath60 of the ft - ir spectra reported in fig .",
    "[ rifab ] of the present work is shown in fig .",
    "[ ripro ] ( thin line ) , together with one of the spectra taken on a lbsco sample inside the cryostat ( thick line ) . before the experiment ,",
    "a high number of subsequent interferograms were recorded by averaging over 256 acquisitions for each of them , with various scanner velocities and a spectral resolution of 1 @xmath7 .",
    "several fourier - transform algorithms where used to obtain the frequency spectrum , and the spectral shape was found to be robust against details of the numerical procedure .",
    "the deviations from 1 of @xmath60 were found to be within 0.2 % of the spectral intensity for @xmath61 @xmath7 in all cases . for completeness",
    ", we also plot the spectrum ( dashed line ) on the same sample and in the same experimental configuration taken with the incoherent infrared synchrotron radiation ( irsr ) source , when the storage ring is run in the standard mode witha current of 150 - 250 ma .",
    "the spectral intensity obtained with the irsr source is already a factor of 10 higher than that obtained with conventional sources .",
    "therefore the gain in intensity of the csr source over conventional sources for @xmath62 @xmath7 can be estimated around 3 orders of magnitude .      ) .",
    "the two lowest optical phonons of the @xmath1 plane leave a weak imprint on @xmath45 around 130 and 360 @xmath7 . in the mid and near infrared @xmath45",

    "therein , data taken with conventional sources ( thin lines ) smoothly connect with data taken with the csr source ( thick lines ) at the same @xmath29 .",
    "one observes clear signs of the sc state in the steep increase of @xmath45 to 1 around 70 @xmath7 at 5 and 12 k in the @xmath65 sample and around 15 @xmath7 at 5 k in the @xmath54 sample .",

    "[ rifab]-c was to be extended above 30 @xmath7 , the obtained @xmath85 would be even smaller .",
    "the above deviations at low @xmath29 could be partially explained by the decrease of @xmath81 with cooling , which reduces the region of validity of the hr - fit , but this would hardly explain the kink structure seen in @xmath45 above the frequency where it deviates from the hr fit .",

    "however , in the case of cuprates , both electron correlations and strong electron - phonon coupling are expected to complicate the conventional , bcs - like theory of cdw . here , given the large error on the absolute value of the conductivity obtained through kramers - kronig transformations @xcite , we choose to consider the peak frequency @xmath111 as the basic spectroscopic parameter . in table",
    "i , @xmath111 is compared with other parameters for different 1/8 doped 214-systems , in order to look for possible correlations .",
    "therein , @xmath111 varies strongly among system where both hole doping and lattice constants ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath58 in table i ) are the same within less than 0.5% .",
    "also the average octahedron tilting angle @xmath21 is clearly uncorrelated with @xmath111 .",
    "this excludes that the different values of @xmath111 may be attributed to either a different density or a different environment of the ordered holes .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the fip observed in the lsco family is due to a collective transverse excitation of charge stripes pinned to impurities . in this framework",
    ", @xmath111 should reflect the size of the co domains @xcite .",
    "this latter , however , is measured by the transverse co correlation length @xmath123 of the diffraction experiments , which does not appreciably change among the samples of table i. for fixed crystal parameters , charge density and domain size , the frequency of the collective mode would only be proportional to the amplitude of the charge modulation @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity increases with the energy gain @xmath124 of the co state with respect to a homogeneous charge distribution , which also determines the value of @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , in table i @xmath13 is the only parameter which increases monotonically with @xmath111 , hence supporting the interpretation of the fip as a collective mode of the co system .",
    "one may notice that , in spite of a higher @xmath13 and a larger @xmath124 than for the static order of @xmath8 = 0.05 , the fluctuating co of @xmath8 = 0.085 does not affect @xmath12 , displaying no apparent competition with superconductivity . on the contrary , collective charge excitations in the proximity of a critical transition may play a role in the pairing mechanism leading to high-@xmath12 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this would be the case of lsco and lbsco with @xmath65 .",
    "on the other hand , in lbsco with @xmath54 or in lnsco , this can not happen as in static co the interaction mediated by collective charge excitations looses its singular behavior @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the fip , proposed in ref .",
    ", is based on the disorder created by nd or ba substitution . in disordered conductors , an increase of the carrier - impurity scattering above the localization threshold shifts the drude peak from zero frequency to some finite - frequency value @xcite . in the co state , since the charges are confined in one - dimensional paths , the localization threshold would be much lower than in the homogeneous state .",
    "therefore the drude peak would be shifted to @xmath111 below @xmath13 .",
    "this scenario faces the difficulty that the charge carriers , lying on the cu - o plane , are relatively insensitive to even large amount of nd or ba substitution .",
    "indeed their response at higher @xmath29 and @xmath40 is independent of such substitution .",
    "a role of disorder in the charge transport , however , is clearly suggested by the low-@xmath29 upturn in @xmath55 , like that shown by the @xmath8 = 0.05 sample in fig .",
    "[ resist ] .",
    "the low-@xmath29 upturn can not be directly connected to an insulating state below the structural transition at @xmath25 , since it starts at much higher @xmath29 .",
    "the same holds for lnsco @xcite .",
    "since , on the contrary , there is no upturn in the @xmath55 of lsco at 1/8 doping , that feature should be related to some sort of carrier localization induced by disorder , with no opening of a real co - gap . indeed , if one determines a characteristic upturn temperature @xmath125 following the procedure indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds @xmath125 = 80 and 110 k for @xmath8 = 0.05 and 0.085 , respectively .",
    "@xmath125 was found @xcite to be correlated with the average octahedron tilt @xmath21 , which increases by increasing disorder in the cation layer ( see section ii ) .",
    "we can therefore assume @xmath125 as a measure of the topological disorder in the sample .",
    "once again , we remark that there is no apparent correlation between @xmath111 and @xmath125 or between @xmath111 and the number of impurity centers , thus making unlikely the interpretation of the fip in terms of disorder - induced localization .",
    "the dramatic effect of the rather slight structural change between the ltlo ( @xmath126 ) and the ltt ( @xmath32 ) phase on the transport and optical properties of lbsco may appear surprising .",
    "however , recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that critical spin interactions may depend strongly on small , structural symmetry breaking @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the in - plane antiferromagnetic correlations of orthorombic lsco have been found to be anomalous if compared to those of other cuprates with a tetragonal ( htt ) structure like ybco . since in underdoped cuprates",
    "the spin degree of freedom plays a key role in the co formation @xcite , we believe that the detailed understanding of the quantum transition from the high-@xmath12 sc to the static co state at @xmath127 requires further studies which should include the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in the present work we have used coherent synchrotron radiation , in combination with conventional sources , to perform reflectivity measurements both along the @xmath2 axis and in the @xmath1 plane of la@xmath3ba@xmath18sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , down to 5 @xmath7 . the clear observation below @xmath12 of a josephson plasma resonance along the @xmath2-axis , besides providing a good check of the experimental efficiency in the sub - thz range , shows that the high-@xmath12 state of 1/8 doped 214-systems can survive in the presence of disorder , structural transitions and even charge ordering .",
    "we then addressed to the main purpose of the experiment , namely the study of the @xmath1 plane optical conductivity in two crystals with different @xmath8 .",
    "they were oriented and measured with a procedure which excludes any spurious contribution from the @xmath2 axis , often invoked to question the observations of anomalous extra - drude contributions ( fip ) in the far infrared .",
    "the two la@xmath3ba@xmath18sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 single crystals were selected in order to investigate charge - order phenomena of different nature : static , and established by a structural transition for @xmath8 = 0.05 , fluctuating and established by a second - order transition for @xmath8 = 0.085 . in the @xmath1-plane conductivity , measured for the first time in a cuprate down to 5 @xmath7 , both of them showed a fip below their different charge - ordering transitions at @xmath13 , which disappeared well below @xmath12 .",
    "one thus finds that - in three compounds of the 214 family with evidence of charge ordering - the peak frequency increases with @xmath13 , then with the amplitude of the charge modulation .",
    "this latter , in turn , is not related in a manifest way to the onset of superconductivity .",
    "we wish to thank l. benfatto , c. castellani , c. di castro , and m. grilli for many useful discussions .",
    "one of us ( m. o. ) is gratefully indebted to m. colapietro and l. maritato for hospitality and help during the x - ray diffraction experiments and the dc transport measurements , respectively .",
