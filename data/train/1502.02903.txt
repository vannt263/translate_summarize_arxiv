    "superconductivity in cuprate superconductors occurs upon charge carrier doping mott insulators @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is well established that the mott insulating state at zero doping develops long - range order antiferromagnetism @xcite . upon",
    "doping the antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order ( aflro ) disappears rapidly and soon thereafter is replaced by the superconducting ( sc ) ground - state @xcite .",
    "after intensive investigations over more than two decades , a large body of data available from a wide variety of measurement techniques have introduced important constraints on the microscopic model and sc theory @xcite . at the temperature above the sc transition - temperature @xmath0 ,",
    "the electron is in a normal - state , however , the normal - state in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes is not normal at all , since the normal - state of cuprate superconductors exhibits a number of the anomalous properties @xcite in the sense that they do not fit in with the standard landau - fermi liquid theory .",
    "the defining characteristic is that the resistivity grows nearly linearly with temperature @xcite .",
    "infrared measurements confirmed that the resistivity scales similarly with energy and temperature , and that the anomalous energy dependence extends up to an energy equivalent to at least 300 mev @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the conductivity in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes shows a non - drude behavior ( the conductivity decays as @xmath1 ) at low energies @xcite , and is carried by @xmath2 charge carriers , where @xmath2 is the charge carrier doping concentration .",
    "these are strong experimental evidences supporting the notion of the charge - spin separation @xcite .",
    "superconductivity is an instability of the normal - state .",
    "however , one of the most striking dilemmas is that the sc coherence of the low - energy quasiparticle excitations in cuprate superconductors seems to be described by the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) formalism @xcite , although the normal - state is undoubtedly not the standard landau fermi - liquid on which the conventional electron - phonon theory is based .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments reveal sharp spectral peaks in the single - particle excitation spectrum @xcite , indicating the presence of quasiparticle - like states , which is also consistent with the long lifetime of the electronic state as it has been determined by the conductivity measurements @xcite .",
    "in particular , as a direct method for probing the electron fermi surface , the early arpes measurements indicate that in the entire doping range , the underlying electron fermi surface satisfies luttinger s theorem @xcite , i.e. , the electron fermi surface with the area is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "later , the arpes experimental studies show that in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes , although the antinodal region of the electron fermi surface is gapped out , leading to the notion that only part of the electron fermi surface survives as the disconnected fermi arcs around the nodes @xcite , the underlying electron fermi surface determined from the low - energy spectral weight still fulfills luttinger s theorem in the entire doping range @xcite .",
    "these arpes experimental facts @xcite on the other hand provide strong evidences supporting the notion of the charge - spin recombination @xcite .",
    "since the electron fermi surface is a fundamental property of interacting electron systems , the study of the nature of the electron fermi surface should be crucial for understanding the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors .",
    "theoretically , it is generally agreed that the strong electron correlation plays a dominant role in the description of the anomalous normal - state properties of cuprate superconductors and the related sc mechanism @xcite .",
    "this strong electron correlation originates from a large on - site repulsion between two electrons occupying the same site , which effectively translates into an elimination of double electron occupancy .",
    "apart from the numerical techniques , an intuitively appealing approach to implement this elimination of double electron occupancy and the charge - spin separation is the slave - particle approach @xcite , where the constrained electron operator @xmath4 is given by a composite operator as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 as the slave boson and @xmath7 as the fermion or _",
    "vice versa _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath6 as the fermion and @xmath7 as the boson . in this slave - particle approach ,",
    "the operator @xmath7 carries spin index ( spinon ) and the operator @xmath6 is interpreted as creating a vacancy ( holon ) .",
    "the elimination of double electron occupancy is presented by the requirement that @xmath8 which can be enforced by introducing a lagrangian multiplier . moreover , the doped holes are mainly responsible for the charge transport , and the relaxation time of the excitation from the spin degree of freedom is mainly responsible for the spin response , while the sc - state is characterized by the charge - spin recombination , forming sc quasiparticles @xcite . in the conventional charge - spin recombination scheme ,",
    "the electron green s function in space - time is a product of the holon and spinon green s functions @xcite .",
    "the resulting fourier transform is a convolution of the holon and spinon green s functions . however , in the early days of superconductivity , we @xcite have formally proved that the electron fermi surface observed experimentally from the arpes experiments can not be restored based on the conventional charge - spin recombination . in this case , a long - standing unsolved problem is how a microscopic theory based on the charge - spin separation can give a consistent description of the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors in terms of a full charge - spin recombination . by the full charge - spin recombination we refer to the obtained electron propagator that can produce a large electron fermi surface with an area proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "for a proper treatment of the strong electron correlation in cuprate superconductors , we @xcite have developed a fermion - spin theory based on the charge - spin separation , where the constrained electron operator is decoupled as a product of a charge carrier and a localized spin , and then the electron motion is restricted in the restricted hilbert space without double electron occupancy . within the framework of the fermion - spin theory ,",
    "we @xcite have established a kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism , where the charge - carrier pairing state is conventional bcs - like with the d - wave symmetry , although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic - energy by the exchange of spin excitations in the higher powers of the doping concentration . in particular , this kinetic - energy driven charge - carrier pairing state is controlled by both the charge - carrier pair gap and charge - carrier quasiparticle coherence , which leads to that the charge - carrier pair transition - temperature @xmath0 takes a domelike shape with the underdoped and overdoped regimes on each side of the optimal doping , where @xmath0 reaches its maximum .",
    "following this kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism , we in this paper develop a full charge - spin recombination scheme , and then show that although the electron cooper pairing state ( then the sc - state ) originates from the charge - carrier pairing state , the low - energy excitation of cuprate superconductors in the sc - state resembles the bcs - bogoliubov quasiparticle .",
    "in particular , we show that the obtained formalism for the electron pairing can be used to compute the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors on the first - principles basis much as can be done for conventional superconductors .",
    "moreover , the theory produces a large electron fermi surface with the area that is given by @xmath3 , while the striking feature of the peak - dip - hump structure in the single - particle excitation spectrum around the antinodal point and remarkable fermi arc behavior in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes are mainly caused by the strong energy and momentum dependence of the electron self - energy .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "since the work in this paper builds on the kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism , a short summary of the formalism of the kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism is first given in section [ framework ] , and then based on this kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism , the basic formalism of the full charge - spin recombination is presented , which is manifested itself by the self - consistent equations that are satisfied by the full electron diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions .",
    "moreover , we confirm that the sc transition - temperature @xmath0 obtained from this full charge - spin recombination scheme is identical to the charge - carrier pair transition - temperature . in section [ electronic - structure ] , the full electron diagonal green s function is employed to study the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors in the sc - state , and then some main features of the arpes measurements on cuprate superconductors in the sc - state are qualitatively reproduced .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "superconductivity in cuprate superconductors is found in copper oxide - based compounds with a layered crystal structure consisting of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath9 planes separated by insulating layers @xcite .",
    "the key element shared by all such structure is the cuo@xmath9 , and then it seems evident that the relatively high @xmath0 in cuprate superconductors is dominated by this cuo@xmath9 plane @xcite . immediately following",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors , anderson @xcite argued that the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath9 plane is contained in the @xmath10-@xmath11 model on a square lattice , @xmath12 where the summation is over all sites @xmath13 , and for each @xmath13 , over its nearest - neighbors @xmath14 or the next nearest - neighbors @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath4 ) is electron creation ( annihilation ) operator with spin @xmath17 , @xmath18 are spin operators , and @xmath19 is the chemical potential . in spite of its simple form , the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) is proved to be very difficult to analyze , analytically as well as numerically .",
    "however , the most difficult in the analytical treatment of the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) comes mainly from the local constraint of no double electron occupancy , i.e. , @xmath20 , while the strong electron correlation manifests itself by this local constraint of no double electron occupancy , and therefore the crucial requirement is to impose this local constraint . in order to satisfy this local constraint",
    ", we employ the fermion - spin formalism @xcite , in which the electron operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are replaced by , @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the spinful fermion operator @xmath24 keeps track of the charge degree of freedom of the constrained electron together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath25 represents the spin degree of freedom of the constrained electron , and then the local constraint of no double occupancy is satisfied at each site . in this fermion - spin representation ( [ css ] ) , the original @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) can be expressed explicitly as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the charge - carrier doping concentration .",
    "since the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) is obtained from the large-@xmath29 hubbard model , taking the large-@xmath29 limit and making certain approximations @xcite , there is a mixing of kinetic energy and potential energy ( coulombic contribution ) @xcite in going from the large-@xmath29 hubbard model to the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) , i.e. , the original kinetic energy in the large-@xmath29 hubbard model has been reorganized as the kinetic energy of the lower hubbard band in the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) , which therefore contains a strong coulombic contribution due to the restriction of no double occupancy of a given site . however , as a consequence of the the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ csstjmodel ] ) in the fermion - spin representation , the mixing of kinetic energy and potential energy in the kinetic - energy term of the original @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ tjmodel ] ) has been released as the interaction between charge carriers and spins in the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ csstjmodel ] ) , which therefore dominates the essential physics of cuprate superconductors , while the magnetic exchange - energy term is to form an adequate spin configuration only . in particular , this spin configuration is strongly rearranged due to the effect of the charge - carrier hopping @xmath10 on the spins . in the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ csstjmodel ] )",
    ", the charge - carrier quasiparticle and spin excitation are strongly renormalized each other because of the coupling between the two degrees of freedom . in this case , three basic low - energy excitations for the charge - carrier quasiparticle , spin excitation , and electron quasiparticle , respectively , emerge as the propagating modes in a doped mott insulator @xcite , with the scattering of charge - carrier quasiparticles due to spin fluctuations that mainly governs the charge transport , and the scattering of spin excitations due to charge - carrier fluctuations dominates the spin response , while as a natural result of the charge - spin recombination , the electron quasiparticles are responsible for the electronic structure .",
    "it is commonly believed that the existence of charge - carrier pairs is the hallmark of superconductivity @xcite , since these charge - carrier pairs behave as effective bosons , and can form something analogous to a bose condensate that flows without resistance .",
    "however , the pairing means that there is an attraction between charge carriers . in conventional superconductors ,",
    "the effective attraction between charge carriers ( electrons ) generates by the exchange of phonons , which act like a bosonic glue to hold the charge - carrier pairs together @xcite , and then these charge - carrier pairs condense into the sc - state . in this conventional electron - phonon sc mechanism @xcite ,",
    "the wave function for the pairs turns out to be peaked at zero separation of the charge carriers , and then the sc - state has a s - wave symmetry . on the other hand , the sc - state in cuprate superconductors",
    "is also characterized by the charge - carrier pairs @xcite , with an energy gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "however , as a natural consequence of the unconventional sc mechanism that is responsible for the high @xmath0 , the charge - carrier pair in cuprate superconductors has a dominant d - wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "this d - wave sc - state also implies that there is a strongly momentum - dependent attraction between charge carriers without phonons @xcite .",
    "in particular , a large body of experimental data @xcite available from a wide variety of measurement techniques benefits that the spin excitation , which is a generic consequence of strong electron correlation , can mediate the charge - carrier pairing state in cuprate superconductors in analogy to the phonon - mediate pairing mechanism in conventional superconductors . within the framework of the fermion - spin theory ( [ css ] ) , we @xcite have established a kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism , where the attractive interaction between charge carriers originates directly from the interaction between charge carriers and spins in the kinetic energy of the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( [ csstjmodel ] ) by the exchange of spin excitations in the higher powers of the doping concentration .",
    "this attractive interaction leads to the formation of the charge - carrier pairs , while the electron cooper pairs originate from the charge - carrier pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and then these electron cooper pairs condense into the d - wave sc - state .",
    "our work of the full charge - spin recombination and its application to study the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors in the sc - state builds on the kinetic - energy driven sc mechanism in refs .",
    "@xcite , and only a short summary of the formalism is therefore given in this subsection for convenience in the following discussions . in our previous discussions in the doped regime without aflro , the full charge - carrier diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions of the @xmath10-@xmath11 model in the charge - carrier pairing",
    "state satisfy following self - consistent equations @xcite ,      where the mean - field ( mf ) charge - carrier green s function @xmath31 , with the charge - carrier excitation spectrum @xmath32 that has been given in refs .",
