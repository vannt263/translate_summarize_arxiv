    "previous studies of random trees typically deal with random structures generated by sequential addition of nodes @xcite . the same holds for widely - used models of network formation which generally describe strictly growing networks @xcite . yet , in many applications including social networks @xcite , evolutionary trees @xcite , and technological networks , nodes may disappear so the network can increase or decrease in size .",
    "a number of recent studies of trees formed by addition and removal of nodes focus on the connectivity of individual nodes and in particular , the degree distribution @xcite .",
    "node removal can cause fragmentation into separate connected components ( see figure [ fig - frag ] ) . yet , theoretical tools for analyzing connected components in random structures undergoing fragmentation are limited @xcite and statistical properties of groups of connected nodes in such processes remain largely an open question .",
    "( left ) into three separate trees with sizes @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( right ) .",
    "each fragment correspond to a branch of that node.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    here , we analyze connected components of a random recursive tree undergoing fragmentation caused by removal of nodes . the original tree is formed by sequential addition of nodes : in each elementary step one node is added and it is attached to an existing node that is selected at random . this process is repeated until a tree with @xmath0 nodes forms .",
    "as nodes are removed from the tree , it fragments into multiple connected components , each having a tree structure .",
    "the resulting `` forest '' consists of multiple trees ( see figure [ fig - forest ] ) .",
    "our main goal is to find the size distribution of connected components in this heterogeneous forest .    as a preliminary step ,",
    "we establish the fragment - size distribution when a single node is removed .",
    "this quantity plays the role of a `` kernel '' for the fragmentation process that ensues as nodes are repeatedly removed from the system .",
    "we use a dynamical formulation where the number of nodes plays the role of time , and use rate equations to describe how the fragment - size distribution evolves .",

    "we also consider growing forests formed by simultaneous addition and removal of nodes . in this case , the size distribution is narrower as it has an exponential tail .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the tree fragmentation process and define the fragment size density ( section ii ) . in section iii",
    ", we consider fragmentation by removal of a single node and derive the fragment - size density as a function of size @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity allows us to write recursion relations for the evolution of the size density throughout the fragmentation process .",
    "we obtain a scaling solution where the fraction of remaining nodes @xmath1 plays the role of a scaling variable ( section iv ) . in section",
    "v , we consider the situation where nodes are added and removed at constant rates , and obtain the leading asymptotic behavior for very large fragments .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion in sec .",
    "the appendix details a few technical derivations .",
    "we study fragmentation of a random tree through sequential removal of nodes .",
    "the starting point is a random recursive tree @xcite .",
    "this tree is generated by sequential addition of nodes with each new node attached to a randomly - selected existing node . starting with one isolated node ,",
    "this process repeats until the tree reaches initial size @xmath0 .",
    "the tree has @xmath14 links and hence , it has no loops .    in each time step ,",
    "one node is selected at random and it is removed from the system together with all of the links connected to it .",
    "hence , the total number of nodes @xmath15 at time @xmath16 is simply @xmath17 at time @xmath18 there are @xmath0 nodes , and the process ends at time @xmath19 with a single remaining node .",
    "as nodes are removed from the system , the tree fragments into multiple connected components .",
    "figure [ fig - frag ] depicts removal of the very first node and figure [ fig - forest ] shows the resulting forest after a finite fraction nodes have been removed .",
    "removal of nodes dissolves the tree into an ensemble of connected components , each having a tree structure .",
    "the evolving forest is a collection of distinct trees and our primary goal is to characterize the sizes of trees in this heterogeneous forest .",
    "let @xmath20 be the average number of trees of size @xmath4 at time @xmath16 in a system of ( initial ) size @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity corresponds to an average over infinitely many independent realizations of the tree generation process and over infinitely many independent realizations of the node removal process .",
    "the initial condition is a single tree of size @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the final state is a single node , @xmath23 .     of the initial @xmath24 nodes remain.,scaledwidth=32.5% ]    the total number of trees is deterministic only at the initial and the final state , but generally , this quantity fluctuates from realization to realization .",
    "in contrast , the total number of nodes is a deterministic quantity .",
    "the number of nodes normalizes the fragment - size density @xmath25 our main goal is to find the fragment - size density as a function of time in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "as a preliminary step , we study @xmath26 , the fragment - size density after a single node has been removed . we define a branch as the subtree attached to a node through one of its links .",
    "figure [ fig - frag ] shows that removal of a node with three links and hence three branches , leads to three fragments .",
    "therefore , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the branches of a node and the fragments generated when that node is removed .",
    "of course , the number of branches equals the node degree .",
    "let @xmath27 be the average number of branches containing @xmath4 nodes of a randomly selected node in a random recursive tree of size @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is equivalent to the fragment - size density at time @xmath28 , that is @xmath29 .",
    "the zeroth moment of the branch - size density gives the average number of branches per node and the first moment gives the total number of nodes minus one , @xmath30 a tree with @xmath0 nodes has @xmath14 links and every link connects two branches .",
    "hence , the total number of branches is @xmath31 , and the average number of branches per node is simply @xmath32 .",
    "the second identity follows from .",
    "the density @xmath27 satisfies the recursion equation @xmath33 this recursion is subject to the `` initial condition '' .",
    "the first two terms account for contributions from existing branches while the last two terms represent branches created by the newly added node ; hence the respective weights @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "when a new node attaches to a branch of size @xmath4 , the branch size grows by one , that is , @xmath36 .",
    "a branch of size @xmath4 consequently expands with probability @xmath37 ; otherwise the branch maintains its size with probability @xmath38 .",
    "the last two terms reflect that a new link generates two new branches , one of size @xmath39 and one of size @xmath21 . by summing",
    ", it is possible to check that the recursion is compatible with the sum rules .    using the recursion relations we can find the branch - size density for small trees . starting with @xmath40 we arrive at @xmath41 it is also possible to check these expressions by enumerating all possible tree morphologies for @xmath42 and removing a randomly - selected node . also , the densities listed in satisfy the sum rules .    the expressions suggest that the fragment - size density is symmetric , @xmath43 .",
    "this symmetry reflects that the recursion relation is invariant under the transformation @xmath44 . moreover , equation suggest the general expression @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the small-@xmath4 expressions adhere to this general form for all @xmath42 and all . for example , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , equation can be justified by induction .",
    "when @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 and the expression satisfies the recursion equation for all @xmath51 .",
    "we also note that the first term @xmath52 in which does not depend on tree size @xmath0 coincides with the distribution of in - component size for a random tree @xcite .     versus the scaling variable @xmath53.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for very large trees , @xmath54",
    ", the density adheres to the scaling form . in terms of the normalized branch size @xmath55 ,",
    "the scaling function is ( see figure [ fig - fx ] ) @xmath56 for @xmath57 and it has the symmetry @xmath58 .",
    "we note that the fragment - size density has a power - law tail @xmath59 for @xmath60 in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "we now consider the distribution of fragment size after multiple nodes have been removed from the system .",
    "importantly , every fragment is itself a random recursive tree .",
    "indeed , every fragment is a piece of the original tree , that is , a subset of connected nodes .",
    "further , this subset expands by same growth mechanism that governs the entire tree .",
    "if a new node is attached to this subset , then every one of the nodes is equally likely to receive this new connection .",
    "this key observation allows us to treat the problem analytically .",
    "since fragments are equivalent to the initial tree , the outcome of the very first fragmentation event characterizes all subsequent fragmentation events .",
    "consequently , the tree fragmentation process reduces to an ordinary fragmentation process @xcite . throughout this process ,",
    "a random tree of size @xmath61 generates a fragment of size @xmath62 with probability @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "hence , the tree morphology is entirely encapsulated by the fragmentation kernel @xmath63 given in .",
    "the fragment - size density evolves according to the linear recursion equation @xmath64 here , we introduce the rescaled density , with the normalization @xmath65 ; this normalization reflects that the probability a randomly - selected node resides in a tree of size @xmath4 equals @xmath66 . henceforth , the dependence on system size is made implicit , @xmath67 .",
    "the recursion equation describes the tree fragmentation process .",
    "the loss term equals fragment size because the probability the removed node belongs to a tree is proportional to tree size .",
    "the gain term reflects the fragmentation process : trees fragment with probability proportional to their size and hence the term @xmath68 , while the second quantity @xmath63 is simply the fragmentation kernel .",
    "we can verify , using the second identity in , that the total number of nodes @xmath69 decreases by one in each fragmentation event in agreement with .",
    "starting with the initial condition @xmath70 , we iterate the recursion equation once and by construction , recover the fragmentation kernel @xmath71 .",
    "we now substitute the expressions for small @xmath0 and iterate the recursion a second time to obtain the fragment - size density once two nodes are removed , @xmath72 these expressions can be manually verified by exact enumeration .",
    "removal of a second node breaks the symmetry in because small fragments become more probable at the expense of large ones .",
    "our main interest is the behavior in the limit @xmath2 . in this limit",
    ", we can treat time as a continuous variable and convert the difference equation into the differential equation @xmath73 the total number of nodes @xmath74 and the total number of trees in the forest @xmath75 obey the differential equations @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "these evolution equations are obtained by summing the rate equations and employing the first two moments of the fragmentation kernel . using the initial conditions @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 we obtain the leading behavior in the limit @xmath11 @xmath80 here , we introduce the fraction of remaining nodes .",
    "as expected , the number of nodes and trees are both proportional to system size . as a result , the average tree size @xmath81 is given by .",
    "the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath82 suggest that the fraction of remaining nodes @xmath1 characterizes the state of the system in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "results of numerical integration of the recursion equation confirm that the fragment - size density depends only on the fraction of remaining nodes in this limit ( see figure [ fig - fs ] ) .",
    "hence , we seek a scaling solution for the fragment - size density . formally , the scaling solution @xmath3 is defined by @xmath83 with @xmath84 kept fixed .",
    "the fragment - size density which in principle depends on two variables , system size @xmath0 and time @xmath16 , becomes a function of a single scaling variable , the fraction of remaining nodes @xmath1 in the large - size limit .",
    "the quantity @xmath85 is the probability that a randomly selected node is part of a tree of size @xmath4 , and accordingly @xmath86 .",
    "we now substitute @xmath87 into the rate equation and introduce the time variable @xmath88 $ ] such that @xmath89 .",
    "this time variable is related to the fraction of remaining nodes @xmath90 . with these transformations",
    ", the normalized density @xmath91 obeys the rate equation @xmath92\\!.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we used the explicit form of @xmath63 .",
    "results of the numerical integration of suggest that the tail of the size density is algebraic ( see figure [ fig - fs ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in appendix a we show that asymptotic analysis of the rate equation yields the power - law decay . in a number of random structures including networks generated by preferential attachment",
    ", power - law tails correspond to ratios of gamma functions @xcite . in these contexts ,",
    "a ratio of gamma functions is the discrete analog of an algebraic function of a continuous variable .",
    "as we show below , such behavior applies to our fragmentation process .",
    "we postulate that the size distribution is a ratio of gamma functions @xmath93 for all @xmath94 with the to - be - determined parameter @xmath7 .",

    "this equation describes how @xmath96 changes as function of @xmath7 .",
    "since the right - hand sides of and are identical , the original rate equation is satisfied if .",
    "thus , we deduce that is a solution of the evolution equation when the parameter @xmath7 evolves according to @xmath97 together with the initial condition @xmath98 that follows from , we obtain @xmath99 and find the parameter @xmath7 as a function of remaining nodes , @xmath100 equations and constitute the exact solution for the scaling function defined in . from this solution",
    ", we can recover the average tree size , @xmath101 .",
    "the fraction of trees can also be obtained explicitly for small tree sizes @xmath102    the results and establish our main result announced in . using the asymptotic behavior as @xmath103",
    "we deduce @xmath104 with prefactor @xmath105 and exponent @xmath7 given in .",
    "this prefactor vanishes in the limit @xmath106 because the number of trees vanishes according to .     versus @xmath4 for the case @xmath107 .",
    "shown are : ( i ) results of numerical iteration of the recursion equation for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ( color lines ) ; ( ii ) corresponding results of monte carlo simulations ( color circles ) ; and ( iii ) the limiting distribution [ black line ] .",

    "this behavior shows that the tail of the size density becomes gradually steeper as more nodes are removed .",
    "the size density also has the unusual property that the exponent governing the tail is time dependent , @xmath114 . power - law tails with _ fixed _ exponents have been observed in models of fragmentation @xcite .",
    "hence , the tree fragmentation process which has an unusual nonmonotonic fragmentation kernel also has the unusual property that the power - law exponent varies continuously with time . in many fragmentation processes ,",
    "the size distribution becomes universal , namely , it does not evolve with time , once the fragment size is scaled by the typical fragment size @xcite .",
    "fragmentation of random trees does not follow this generic pattern as manifest from the fact that the exponent is not fixed .",
    "the power - law tail shows that the forest created by the node removal process is heterogeneous and includes trees of a variety of sizes ( figure [ fig - forest ] ) . when the size of the initial tree @xmath0 is large but finite , the solution and its power - law tail hold only for sizes @xmath115 . the size distribution is sharply suppressed beyond this maximal scale which represents the size of the largest tree in the forest .",
    "the cutoff scale @xmath116 can be obtained by the extreme statistics criterion @xmath117 . from this heuristic argument",
    ", the cutoff grows algebraically with system size @xmath118 hence , as more nodes are removed , the range of validity of and shrinks . for example , when @xmath107 then @xmath119 and as shown in figure [ fig - fs ] , the rate of convergence toward the @xmath11 limiting behavior slows down with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , astronomically large trees are needed to realize the power - law behavior in the limit @xmath120 .",
    "we verified the theoretical predictions using direct integration of the recursion equation and using monte carlo simulations of the tree fragmentation process ( figure [ fig - fs ] ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulation results agree with numerical solution of the recursion equation for finite @xmath0 .",
    "this agreement supports the assertion that fragments remain statistically equivalent to random recursive trees throughout the fragmentation process .",
    "also , the numerical results agree with the scaling behavior . finally , we confirmed the scaling function for the case @xmath107 for which @xmath121^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were performed by mimicking the tree creation and fragmentation processes . to generate the initial configuration , a random recursive tree of size",
    "@xmath0 was constructed .",
    "the tree is formed by sequential addition of nodes .",
    "the attachment probability is uniform such that every existing node is equally likely to receive a new link .",
    "then , nodes are removed , one at a time , until @xmath15 nodes remain .",
    "the simulation results presented in this paper represent an average over multiple independent realizations of the tree creation and node removal processes .    for completeness",
    ", we briefly mention the degree distribution .",
    "we consider links to be directed and restrict our attention to the in - degree distribution .",
    "let @xmath122 be the average number of nodes with @xmath123 incoming links once @xmath1 nodes have been removed .",
    "it is well known that for the random recursive tree , the degree distribution is exponential , @xmath124 @xcite . since the fragments remain equivalent to a random recursive tree , we expect the degree distribution to remain exponential . by generalizing similar calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is simple to obtain the in - degree distribution @xmath125 the in - degree distribution remains exponential throughout the fragmentation process and the exponent @xmath7 governs the exponential decay of the in - degree distribution .",
    "several recent studies have addressed the situation where nodes can be added or removed @xcite . in this section , we consider the case where nodes are added at constant rate @xmath126 and removed ( as above ) with unit rate .",
    "both processes are completely random : a newly added node links to a randomly selected node , and nodes are selected at random for removal .",
    "initially , the system consists of a single node @xmath127 .",
    "the number of nodes obeys the rate equation @xmath128 and hence , it grows steadily with time @xmath129 we restrict our attention to the growing case , @xmath130 .",
    "the total number of trees @xmath82 is not affected by the addition process , so it evolves according to @xmath77 as above . solving this rate equation subject to the initial condition @xmath79",
    ", we express the number of trees as a function of the number of nodes @xmath131 in the long - time limit , the average tree - size does not depend on time , @xmath132 as @xmath133 . the second term in is negligible in this limit , and we thus conclude that statistical properties of the forest are characterized by the parameter @xmath126 alone .",

    "the first two terms characterize changes due to node addition and simply reflect that the probability a tree expands by addition of a new node is proportional to its size .",

    "the simulation results suggest that the tail of the size density is exponential , although there is an algebraic correction , @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "for such a distribution , the first sum in is negligible compared with the second sum , and the leading behavior of the second sum is ( see appendix c ) @xmath142 in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "the two constants are and . by substituting into",

    "this gives @xmath147 .",
    "next , we substitute into and compare the magnitudes of the leading corrections @xmath148 to find @xmath149 .",

    "consequently , the two terms become comparable over a growing range with the cross - over scale @xmath152 . when @xmath153 , the powerlaw decay is dominant and only when @xmath154 does the distribution decay exponentially .",
    "we also note that in the presence of addition , very large trees become less probable and the forest becomes less heterogeneous .     versus @xmath4 for the case @xmath155 .",
    "shown are results of numerical integration of equation .",
    "also shown are results of monte carlo simulations for @xmath156 , averaged over @xmath157 independent runs.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we numerically simulated the node addition and removal process . in each simulation step , with probability @xmath158 a new node is added and with probability @xmath159 one node is deleted .",
    "time is augmented as follows , @xmath160 after each step .",
    "when a single node remains , deletion is prohibited .",
    "the monte carlo simulation results confirm that the rate equation yields the exact size distribution ( figure [ fig - fs - ss ] ) . hence , even in the presence of node addition , fragments remain statistically equivalent to a random recursive tree .",
    "in summary , we studied fragmentation of a single random tree by sequential removal of nodes . the emerging random",
    "forest is an ensemble of disconnected random trees of disparate sizes .",
    "the size distribution of trees in this forest has an algebraic tail and the exponent characterizing this decay increases continuously with the number of removed nodes .",
    "the original tree expands through sequential addition of nodes and it dissolves through sequential removal of nodes .",
    "the morphology of the fragments mirrors that of the parent fragment and thanks to this feature , knowledge of the very first fragmentation event allows us to describe the outcome of subsequent fragmentation events .",
    "this key observation enables us to obtain statistical properties of groups of connected nodes , thereby going beyond characterization of individual nodes .",
    "we also considered a forest created by addition and removal of nodes and found that in this case , too , trees remain random throughout the evolution process .",
    "however , the size density becomes narrower and it has an exponential , rather than algebraic , tail .",
    "it is illuminating to compare fragmentation of random trees with fragmentation of linear chains of connected nodes where internal nodes have degree two , except for the end nodes that have degree one . in this case , the fragmentation kernel is simply @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "clearly , fragments maintain the linear morphology of the parent tree .",
    "this case is equivalent to most basic fragmentation process , the random scission process where a linear rod fragments repeatedly at a randomly selected location . by substituting the kernel into and repeating the steps leading to , it is easy to see that the fragment - size density is purely exponential @xcite @xmath163 where @xmath1 is again the fraction of remaining nodes .",
    "this example shows that tree morphology strongly affects the outcome of the fragmentation process .",
    "the distribution of fragment size can therefore be used to probe the structure of the fragmented objects .",
    "a number of experiments on fragmentation of solid objects have reported power - law size distributions with a wide range of exponents @xcite .",
    "it will be indeed interesting to find physical fragmentation processes @xcite where the size distribution becomes steeper with time .",
    "our study deals with discrete objects where fragment size has a lower bound .",
    "a natural extension of our study is to study fragmentation of more complicated random or disordered structures .",
