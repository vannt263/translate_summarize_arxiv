    "a typical ilustration of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite is the imprinting of a phase factor on the electron s wave function in the region outside a solenoid under a magnetic field applied only in its interior",
    ". another important feature of this effect is that this phase factor , the so - called ab phase , generated in the presence of a non - zero gauge potential in a region with a null electromagnectic field modifies the corresponding energy spectrum of the charged particle @xcite .",
    "the presence of the ab phase represents a direct influence of a vector potential on the particle dynamics and one of remarkable possibilities of quantum interference @xcite .",
    "the emergence of the ab effect in the problem of a charged particle minimally coupled to a gauge field @xmath0 , ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , for a singly connected region , with @xmath4 , has as a consequence the splitting of the wave function in two parties with the acquired ab phase term @xcite . considering a magnetostatic field ,",
    "the whole path closed and the gauge fixing contribution of the ab phase shift term is given by @xmath5 .",
    "the interference in the electron states coming from the right and left parts around the solenoid give rise to a superposition state with the acquired ab phase given by @xmath6 this can be undertaken from an interaction between a source - field and the electron , as discussed in @xcite , with the whole state given by @xmath7 , colapsing to a final configuration where the left and right states are identical except for the presence of the ab phase , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , leaving the total state in the following final form @xmath10 .",
    "methods of generating ab phases have growth in different fields , representing an important role in solid - state interferometers @xcite , nanotubes @xcite , transmission microscopy @xcite , alsb / inas heterostructures @xcite , quantum hall effect regime @xcite , kondo resonance @xcite and spin transport @xcite .",
    "detection of this effect in photonic states @xcite , optical induction in mesoscopic systems @xcite and interaction of ab ring in a high - q cavity @xcite are examples of the increasing importance of such effect in interacting light - and - matter systems and optical analogues of the ab effect @xcite .",
    "advances in the domain of artificial gauge fields have allowed new possibilities in the application of ab effect and geometrical phases @xcite .",
    "optical berry phase @xcite , aharonov - casher effect @xcite as well as the ab effect for neutral particles have also been explored in several contexts @xcite .",
    "the possibility of controlling the ab effect in different scenarios and retransmit the phase from the domain where the effect was originally created is an important step in the phenomenological control and the manipulation of the associated information .",
    "such a realization is particularly important for quantum information and computation tasks .",
    "gate controlled ab oscillations @xcite and topological spin transistor ( tst ) @xcite are advances in such direction .",
    "the last one makes use of quantum spin hall insulators , experimentally realized in hgte quantum wells @xcite , with particular importance in spintronics applications @xcite .",
    "analog of a datta - das spin transistor @xcite , in the tst the properties of the quantum spin hall insulator ( qshi ) are used to generate an ab phase , that makes and an effective rotation of the outgoing spin state with respect to the ingoing spin @xcite . the control of ab phases @xcite",
    "can also be used for bit codification of the information associated to the ab effect . in the case of a tst , the presence or absence of flux is associated to the presence or not of a phase in the outgoing electron state .    here , we discuss optical and spin - optical superpositions in carrying an ab phase .",
    "we start considering the instance of a tst as spintronic device to implement a quantum transfer to a coherent state in a high - q cavity as quantum optical device .",
    "furthermore , we show that manipulation and control of the ab effect in a tst allows the generation of spin superpositions with an ab phase while the interaction with a coherent state in a high - q cavity leads to the possibility of manipulating this phase in the quantum optical scenario .",
    "we consider a setup consisting of a tst coupled to a high - q cavity carrying initially a non - classical state of light , a coherent state , and a detector that project the final spin state in one specific state ( see figure [ cavity ] ) . coupling a quantum ring to high - q cavities",
    "have been considered previously in other contexts @xcite .",
    "the high - q cavity is built experimentally using supermirrors with extremelly low losses , achiving q factor of the order @xmath11 .",
    "the integration with a tst can be realized in the implementation with for instance a photonic cristal cavity @xcite.the ab phase generated in the tst can be quantum transfered to the coherent state superposition , considering the interaction with the spin state and the quantum optical manipulation of the coherent state superposition .",
    "we demonstrate that the ab phase generated in the tst can be transfered to the coherent state superposition , considering the interaction with the spin state and the quantum optical manipulation of the coherent state superposition .",
    "we will show that these cases provide examples of two - qubit states modulated by ab effect and the phase parameter can be used to control the degree of rotation of the qubit state .",
    "we also discuss the fact that a flux control can then be associated to a binary codification , allowing a sequence ( string ) of bits of a given length be generated in such a way .",
    "in particular , the ab phase can be quantum transfered from the spintronic device to a quantum optical one , increasing the possible scenarios where the information can be manipulated and stored .",
    "finally , we will discuss a particular dissipative scenario , by means which we provide and solve a given lindblad equation for coupling the coherent state and a spin state with an acquired ab phase to a thermal revervoir .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the generation and bit - enconding of ab phases by exploring the ab effect . in sec iii ,",
    "we propose the quantum transfer of ab phase to a coherent state superposition . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the use of quantum transfer to store a string of bits enconded by ab phases .",

    "an aharonov - bohm phase is acquired by the outgoing state that interacts with a high - q cavity state ( dashed red lines ) and finally an electron detection is realized in a specific direction . ]    when the outgoing spin state is injected dispersivelly in the high - q cavity , the interaction between the coherent state and the spin state , in a dispersive regime , can generate an entanglement .",
    "the setup starts with the electron in the ferromagnet lead being injected into qshi ring in a @xmath12-spin polarized direction , @xmath13 .",
    "due the properties of the qshi , the state splits in the ring setup according to the helical properties of the edge states , the edge states of opposite spin polarization counterpropagate in the of spin up ( @xmath14 clockwise direction ) @xmath15 and spin down ( @xmath16 counterclockwise direction ) @xmath17 , in the top and bottom edges of the ring , respectivelly @xcite .",
    "the presence of a magnetic flux into the middle of the ring inserts a ab phase @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , in the outgoing electron .",
    "this electron state is rotated in the @xmath20 plane leading to a state of the form @xmath21 , with a dispersive interaction of the outgoing state with the coherent state in an off - resonant regime , the coupling interaction in the high - q cavity can be written by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an effective coupling and the number operator @xmath24 is associated to the quantized electromagnectic field , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the creation and annihilation operators acting on the coherent state and the single - electron operator given by @xmath27 the quantized electromagnetic field in a high - q cavity initially in a coherent state @xmath28 interacts effectivelly with the electron states @xmath29 and @xmath17 , where a degeneracy @xmath30 is assumed , corresponding to electron states of same kinectic energy . the single - mode field",
    "initially in the coherent state @xmath28 has an associated frequency @xmath31 , such that a energy difference between the electron kinectic energy and the single - mode frequency is given @xmath32 .",
    "a prototipical ilustration of such scheme is given in the figure [ cavity1 ] , where a spin state is injected in the @xmath12-direction and a superpostion is generated along ring in a superposition of edge states in up and down direction .",
    "the ab phase is acquired by the outgoing state that interacts with a high - q cavity state .    for large detuning and short evolving times , where the magnetostatic flux is much slower than the frequency of the quantized electromagnetic field ,",
    "the dispersive interaction between the ab - shifted electrons and the single - mode field can be considered . in order to see that the interaction ( [ ef1 ] ) in fact leads to a phase entanglement with the coherent state for an appropriate time of interaction , we can act with the hamiltonian @xmath33 in the general case , it follows @xmath34 the unitary evolutions",
    "are then given explicitly by @xmath35 the terms @xmath36 implies the presence of a sign contribution .",
    "@xmath37 as a consequence , we can write the unitary evolutions as @xmath38 @xmath39",

    "we proposed a quantum transfer of aharonov - bohm phase to a non - classical state of light from a tst , a spintronic device , to a high - q cavity field , a quantum optical device .",
    "the quantum state generated in the tst is injected in the cavity in a superposed spin state with the presence of an ab phase .",
    "the interaction with the coherent state then leads to an entanglement .",
    "a measurement of the spin state finally projects the ab phase in the non - classical state of light , whose quantum optical manipulation leads to a qst .",

    "the presence of a phase in a quantum state can be used for the generation of quantum interference effects that can be quantum transfered from a solid state to quantum optical state .",
    "the transfer of an ab phase to a quantum optical device also leads to the possibility of transfer the ab interferences from the solid state to the optical device .",
    "bit and qubit condifications can be realized by modulation of the ab phase . in particular ,",
    "a qubit state can be generated with the coefficients modulated by the ab phase in the quantum transfer .",
    "we also explored the presence of dissipative effects , in particular , exploring the lindblad equation , considering the system in a thermal bath . a particular lindblad equation",
    "was then achieved and solved for the system in the presence of an ab phase .",
    "given the experimental advances in the generation and control of ab effect , such a quantum transfer can be experimentally realized and further progress can be achieved .",
    "our proposal can also be useful to make progress in methods of quantum information associated to modern techniques in synthetic gauge fields .",
    "taking advantange of quantum information methods for control and manipulation of quantum interference phenomena , the methods of synthetic gauge fields can be improved and spintronics can be integrated with quantum optical devices .",
