    "materials in which there is strong interplay between ferroelectric and magnetic ordering are attracting current interest due to the possibility of controlling the electric polarization by application of a magnetic field or conversely the magnetisation with an electric field . in the last few years",
    ", studies have been focussed on systems , such as tbmno@xmath3 @xcite and _ _ r__mn@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite , for which the ferroelectric transition coincides with the transition to a complex antiferromagnetic ordered phase at low - temperature .",
    "these systems are classified as _ improper _",
    "ferroelectrics , since the primary order parameter is the magnetization , and their electrical polarization is at least an order of magnitude lower than in proper ferroelectrics@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the coupling between the magnetization and the electrical polarization is strong , providing an exciting playground in which to study the microscopic mechanisms that govern the magneto - electric interaction .",
    "moreover , the aforementioned systems commonly present a high degree of magnetic frustration , which seems closely linked to the appearance of ferroelectricity@xcite .",
    "+ the nature of the low - temperature state in these materials has been investigated by a variety of experimental techniques sensitive to small ionic displacements in a crystal ( raman , ir spectroscopy)@xcite and scattering techniques sensitive to the magnetic order ( neutron , resonant x - ray scattering)@xcite .",
    "an increasing number of theoretical models have also appeared over the last two years that discuss the origin of the magneto - electric coupling@xcite .",
    "two microscopic mechanisms have been put forward : on one hand the antisymmetric _ inverse _ dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , requiring a non - collinear magnetic arrangement and on the other hand exchange - striction due to symmetric exchange . in the dm model , the polarization direction * p * ( atomic displacement direction )",
    "is given by the expression : @xmath4 where s@xmath5 and s@xmath1 are neighboring spins and e@xmath6 is the propagation direction .",
    "the proportionality constant is related to the strength of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it seems that this mechanism explains the origin of ferroelectricity in many systems recently investigated such as tbmno@xmath3@xcite .",
    "exchange - striction , which is intrinsically stronger that dm , does not require non - collinearity , and has been proposed to explain the appearance of ferroelectricity in rmn@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite and in the e -phase of homno@xmath3@xcite .",
    "recent work by infra - red absorption confirmed that both mechanisms described above are relevant , as suggested by different polarization selection rules for the electromagnons in _",
    "_ r__mno@xmath3 and _ _ r__mn@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite .",
    "it is important to note , that due to the extremely small shifts of atoms in the ferroelectric state with respect to their positions in the centro - symmetric paraelectric phase , these displacement patterns have not yet been properly determined .",
    "the mechanism which drives the ferroelectric transition can therefore often be more easily inferred from analysis of the magnetic configuration derived from neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "+ there has been continuing interest in the complex magnetic structures of _ _ r__mn@xmath7o@xmath8 with _",
    "= rare earth ( space group pbam ) since the 1960s @xcite .",
    "these insulators order antiferromagnetically at low temperature",
    "( t@xmath9 @xmath10 40 k ) with a propagation vector ( k@xmath11 , 0 , k@xmath12 ) and on further cooling undergo a series of magnetic transitions to both commensurate and incommensurate magnetic phases .",
    "these materials become ferroelectric at a temperature slightly below the nel transition at t@xmath9 with values of electric polarization , ranging from 20 to 100 nc.@xmath13 depending on the _ r _ ion , being largest in the commensurate phase .",
    "the component of the magnetic propagation vector along _ c _ ( k@xmath14 ) depends on the size of the _ r _ cation , which suggests that the magnetic exchange along the _ c_-direction is extremely sensitive to the interlayer coupling@xcite .",
    "bi with r@xmath15=131 pm has the largest ionic radius of the series and in bimn@xmath1o@xmath2  k@xmath14=1/2 whereas k@xmath14=1/4 for ymn@xmath1o@xmath2 , homn@xmath1o@xmath2  and tbmn@xmath1o@xmath2 with r@xmath15=116,116,118 pm respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the onset and strength of ferroelectricity does not seem to be dependent on r@xmath15 .",
    "+ the magnetic structures of this class of materials have mostly been derived from neutron diffraction on polycrystalline samples . recently however , noda and co - workers have reported results obtained by single - crystal neutron diffraction for the commensurate magnetic phase of ymn@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite .",
    "their analysis suggested the presence of a small @xmath16-axis component of magnetic moment on the mn sites , which had not been detected in previous powder measurements@xcite .",
    "this additional component is in phase quadrature with the major a - b component and introduces a cycloidal modulation of the magnetic moments which could , in principle , induce ferroelectric order through the dm interaction .",
    "+ in the light of this recent work , we have undertaken determination of the commensurate magnetic structures of three compounds bimn@xmath1o@xmath2 , ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2  using single - crystal neutron diffraction .",
    "variation of the cations allows a comparative study in which their influence on various characteristics of the magnetic structures can be distinguished .",
    "the aim of the study is twofold : first to search systematically for the presence of the _ c_-axis modulation in several members of the series so as to gauge its importance in promoting ferroelectricity .",
    "determination of the magnitude of this component for all three compounds is especially important because the magnetic propagation vector in bimn@xmath1o@xmath2(k@xmath14=@xmath17 ) differs from that in homn@xmath1o@xmath2  and ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  ( k@xmath14=@xmath18 ) .",
    "secondly , by studying homn@xmath1o@xmath2 , we can investigate the influence of a magnetic _ r _ ion on the arrangement of the mn moments and determine the magnetic ordering of the ho sublattice itself .",
    "comparison with ymn@xmath1o@xmath2 , which has the same propagation vector but a non - magnetic _ r _ site is of particular interest , since the values of the electric polarization in the commensurate regime of the two systems are significantly different .",
    "single crystals of _ _ r__mn@xmath7o@xmath8 ( _ _ r__=bi , y , ho ) were grown using b@xmath1o@xmath3/pbo / pbf@xmath1 flux in a pt crucible . the flux was held at 1,280@xmath19c for 15 hours and slowly cooled down to 950@xmath19c at a rate of 1@xmath19c per hour .",
    "crystals grew in the form of cubes .",
    "the samples used for the present work were respectively of sizes : @xmath20 4x4x4 mm@xmath21 for ymn@xmath1o@xmath2 , 2x2x2 mm@xmath21 for homn@xmath1o@xmath2  and 1x1x3 mm@xmath21 for bimn@xmath1o@xmath2 , where the three dimensions refer to the [ 110 ] , [ @xmath2210 ] and [ 001 ] directions . for the homn@xmath1o@xmath2crystal , additional faces ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) were also visible .",
    "single crystal diffraction measurements were performed on the four - circle diffractometer d10 at the ill ( grenoble , france ) .",
    "samples were checked for quality and pre - aligned with the ( 001 ) direction oriented along the vertical axis using the orientexpress facility ( ill ) .",
    "samples were mounted on standard aluminum pins in a he exchange gas cryostat .",
    "data were collected with an incident neutron wavelength of @xmath23 = 2.36   using an 80 mm@xmath24 2d micro - strip detector .",
    "@xmath25 scans around each bragg reflection were performed , with variable counting time depending on the intensity .",
    "peak integration was performed using the program _ racer _ ( ill ) , in two steps .",
    "first , a library was built by fitting ellipsoidal shapes to a set of strong reflections ( i@xmath263@xmath27 ) , these shapes were used in a second pass to integrate all reflections .",

    "the data sets for ymn@xmath1o@xmath2were collected at t = 25 k ( nuclear and magnetic scattering ) , those for bimn@xmath1o@xmath2  at t = 10 k ( nuclear and magnetic scattering ) and for homn@xmath1o@xmath2  at t = 50 k ( nuclear scattering ) and t = 25 k ( magnetic scattering ) . for each data - set ,",
    "the list of integrated intensities obtained were corrected for lorentz - factors and normalized to an arbitrary monitor count .",
    "determination of both the nuclear and magnetic structures were carried out using the fullprof program suite@xcite .",
    "for each sample the following procedure was applied : the published crystallographic models , space group _ pbam _ were used to refine the nuclear data - sets . because a limited q - range is accessible on d10 , the crystallographic parameters were fixed , with the exception of a global thermal parameter to account for different temperatures .",
    "in addition , a global scale factor was refined together with six parameters for extinction correction , following the formulation of becker - coppens for anisotropic extinction ( extinction model number 4 in fullprof ) .",
    "this correction is particularly important for ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  because of the large size of the crystal .",
    "the scale factors obtained by refining the nuclear structure were used and fixed for refinement of the magnetic structures .",

    "there are four symmetry equivalent mn@xmath28  sites and four mn@xmath29  sites per unit - cell .",

    "+ the magnetic structures have been analyzed using the propagation - vector formalism , in which magnetic moments for all sites described above are expanded in fourier series .",
    "we briefly describe the conventions used in the next paragraph . for a magnetic structure with a single propagation vector @xmath31 , which is the relevant case in this study , a magnetic moment of atom type j in the crystallographic unit - cell l ( @xmath32 )",

    "@xmath34 is a pure lattice translation and @xmath35 is a phase factor .",
    "the magnetic structure is fully determined by giving a set of fourier coefficients and phases ( @xmath36,@xmath35 ) for each j , i.e seven components per site in the most general case since the fourier coefficients are complex quantities .",
    "we note that because @xmath32 is a real quantity , the constraint @xmath37=@xmath38 ( where * denotes the complex conjugate ) is required .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath35 are relative phases and are equal for sites belonging to the same orbit , i.e. sites that can be transformed into each other by an operation of the magnetic little group .",
    "it is different than a global phase , that ca nt be determined by diffraction , which rephase the entire magnetic structure , i.e. apply simultaneously to all magnetic sites .",
    "additional constraints exist between ( @xmath36,@xmath35 ) of symmetry - related sites .",
    "these constraints are determined by representation analysis and will be briefly described in the following sections , based on previously published work@xcite .",
    "+        the propagation vector for the y - compound in the commensurate phase ( cm ) is @xmath31=(1/2 , 0 , 1/4 ) .",
    "symmetry analysis @xcite indicates that the mn@xmath29  sites is split into two orbits because the _ m@xmath14 _ mirror - plane operation does not belong to the little group .",
    "the first and second orbits contain respectively the b1/b3 sites and b2/b4 sites .",
    "the @xmath35 phases for each orbit can therefore be non - equal and treated as free parameters during the refinement . on the other hand , the phases of the mn@xmath28  sites , belonging to a single orbit , must be equal .",
    "we arbitrarily chose to fix the phase of the mn@xmath28  sites at 0.125 ( one phase must be fixed since structure factors do not depend on a global phase ) , for comparison with results reported earlier from powder data @xcite describing a configuration with equal moments . in this case , representation analysis does not impose any constraints on the magnitude and direction of the fourier coefficients for both mn@xmath28  and mn@xmath29  sites@xcite .",
    "for each site , six independent fourier coefficients are in principle refinable .",
    "the unconstrained model has therefore fifty parameters and describe the most general magnetic structure . for typical magnetic structures described by either spin - density waves ( sdw ) or simple cycloidal modulations ,",
    "some of these parameters will be fully correlated .",
    "refining an unconstrained model against the 355 independent magnetic reflections fails due to the large number of parameters and the presence of strong correlations . in order to find possible models , a global optimization algorithm , using the simulated annealing procedure described in @xcite ,",
    "was employed .",
    "systematically , the fourier coefficients for all magnetic sites were found to be principally along the _",
    "a_-axis , whether real or imaginary . in addition , a weaker _ b_-axis component was found with the same character ( real or imaginary ) as the _ a_-component .",
    "these two components define a vector , say v@xmath5 in the _ ab_-plane . a small _ c_-axis component in phase quadrature with",
    "the _ a _ and _ b_-components was also identified .",
    "the structure therefore has a small helicoidal modulation , with rotation axis given by the cross product of v@xmath5 with a vector along z. a model with this configuration , i.e one in which the fourier coefficients for all magnetic sites are real in the _ ab_-plane and imaginary along _ c _ , has been constructed , it has 26 refinable parameters . the lower number of free parameters allowed a direct least - square refinement to be made which converged after a few cycles .",
    "the structure factors calculated with this model are shown , plotted against those observed , in fig .",

    "in addition , there is a significant _",
    "c_-component on all magnetic sites as suggested by noda et al.@xcite , which was not found in our earlier analysis of powder data .",
    "c_-components have almost the same magnitude as the _ b_-components on both mn sites .",
    "their imaginary character means that the modulation is in quadrature with the real _ in - plane _ components .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ y_ac ] ; for example for the a2 site the in - plane components of the magnetic moment follow a ( - + + - ) sequence across four unit - cells along _",
    "c _ whilst the c - component follows a ( - - + + ) sequence .",
    "this result is also in agreement with the work of noda et al .",
    "+ the refined values of the phases for sites b1/b3 and b2/b4 , respectively 0.095(2 ) and 0.156(2 ) , are slightly different from the fixed values of 0.125 used for fitting powder data . consequently , and in addition to the existence of a _",
    "c_- component , the magnetic moments on site b1 and b2 ( as well as b3 and b4 ) are of different magnitudes as shown in fig [ y_ac ] .",
    "we also note that there is a symmetric deviation of these phases with respect to mn@xmath28phase of 0.125 ( ( 0.125-@xmath42 ) for the first orbit and ( 0.125+@xmath42 ) for the second orbit ) .",
    "the identification of a small _ c_-component has direct implications on the nature of the magnetic configuration , previously described as a pure sdw : small cycloidal modulations propagating along the edge - sharing mn@xmath29o@xmath43 chains are observed in the _ ac _ and _ bc _",

    "[ y_bc ] , rotates in the same direction along b1/b2 chains and b3/b4 chains .",
    "the mn@xmath28  moments are also slightly tilted along the _ c_-direction , remaining almost collinear to adjacent mn@xmath29  magnetic moments in a given afm chain .",
    "therefore , the presence of antiferromagnetic chains running along the _ a_-axis , identified earlier as an important characteristic of these systems , remain valid despite the small _ c_-component .",
    "the arm of the star of k is made only of the two vectors @xmath31=(@xmath17,0,@xmath18 ) and -@xmath31 since the vectors ( -@xmath17,0,@xmath18 ) and ( @xmath17,0,-@xmath18 ) are related to k and -k by a reciprocal lattice vector . therefore , a single k - domain contributes to the scattering . on the other hand",
    ", one must take into account the `` orientation '' domains , i.e. domains that are obtained by applying symmetry operations of the paramagnetic group that are not valid operations ( lost ) of the magnetic structure .",
    "four symmetry operations of the paramagnetic group ( combined or not with complex conjugation ) leaves the magnetic structure unchanged , as shown in table [ summetrytable ] .",
    "we refer to this domain as domain one ( d1 ) .",
    "the other four symmetry operations all transform the magnetic structure described in the previous section into an inequivalent one ( domain 2 , d2 , shown in fig .",
    "[ y_ab_d2 ] ) .",
    "no other domains exist , and d1 and d2 are simply related by inversion symmetry .",
    "inversion symmetry operates differently on different magnetic sites : for b@xmath3 , b@xmath30 , a@xmath5 and a@xmath30 , belonging to one of the zig - zag afm chain , the application of inversion symmetry leaves the a and b moment components unchanged while it changes the sign of the c - component .",
    "in contrast for sites b@xmath5 ,",
    "b@xmath1 , a@xmath1 and a@xmath3 ( the other afm chain ) , inversion symmetry reverses the sign of the a and b components while preserving the c component .",
    "since d1 and d2 are related by inversion symmetry , the diffracted intensities arising from both domains are identical for a non - polarized diffraction experiment and refining the data assuming any domain leads to the same result .",
    "we note that the two domains are also related by a simple rotation by 180@xmath19 along the _ z_-axis or the _ x_-axis .",
    "+ from the list of symmetry operations ( table .",
    "[ summetrytable ] ) that leave the magnetic structure invariant ( modulo complex conjugation operation ) , one derives the point group @xmath44 in the magnetically ordered phase , in agreement with that obtained earlier from co - representation analysis@xcite .",
    "this point group is compatible with ferroelectricity along the _",
    "b_-axis , irrespective of the microscopic magneto - electric mechanism .",

    "the magnetic structure has been determined in the commensurate phase from 381 independent magnetic reflections , using the same procedure as that described in the case of ymn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "however in this case , the magnetic ordering of ho is an additional complexity which increases the number of free parameters . attempting to refine the data without a magnetic contribution on the ho sites , leads to poor agreement factors ( r(f)=20.2% ) as already reported from analyzing powder diffraction patterns@xcite .",
    "preliminary measurements with resonant x - ray scattering at the l@xmath45 edge directly confirm the magnetic ordering of ho .",
    "symmetry analysis indicates that the four equivalent ho positions belong to the same orbit and therefore only one phase parameter is required . however , there are no constraints between components of the moment of different sites , which were refined independently .",

    "it is possible that a smaller , @xmath47 out of phase component along _ c _ may exist , but the refined magnitudes are only three times larger than the error bars . although the magnetic configuration of the ho sites is identical to that derived earlier by simulated annealing using powder data@xcite , the orientation of the ho moments in the _ ab_-plane is quite different .",
    "the values of the ho moments , ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 @xmath48 , are much smaller than the fully saturated value for a j=8 state .",
    "this can be partly explained by splitting of the fully degenerate j=8 state by the crystal field , but typical crystal - field energies in oxides will lead to a moment much larger than observed here@xcite .",
    "additional reduction can be due thermal excitation , at 25k , of levels above the ground state ( ho@xmath28 is a non - kramer ion characterized by singlet levels ) .",
    "moreover , dipolar field calculations show no direct correlation between the local field generated by neighbors magnetic mn sites and the magnitude and direction of the ho moments .",
    "therefore we argue that the ho moment of @xmath201.1@xmath48 in homn@xmath1o@xmath2  is mainly due to super - exchange interactions via the 2p oxygen orbitals .",
    "exactly half of the ho layers show ordered magnetic moments in the _",

    "[ ho_ac ] ) .",
    "accordingly , in the former type of layers , we can clearly show that the directions of the moment are systematically arranged along the resultant of afm super - exchange interactions with the four nearest - neighbor mn@xmath29 sites ( fig .",

    "[ ho_ac ] ) .",
    "the net moment on each ho sites is pointing either along the _ a_-axis ( sites c3 and c4 ) or _",

    "also , the resultant of the super - exchange is larger for sites c3 and c4 ( along the _ a_-direction ) than for sites c1 and c2 ( along _ b _ ) , which should lead to different ho moments on these sites , as we appear to observe experimentally ( table [ homn2o5fixedtable ] ) . a more precise determination of the respective magnitude of the moments on sites c1/c2 and c3/c4 is currently underway by resonant x - ray scattering .",
    "calculations show that azimuthal scans on magnetic bragg peaks at the ho l@xmath45 edge are extremely sensitive to these parameters ( as well as being ho selective ) . + the magnetic configuration of the ho sublattice also breaks inversion symmetry since moments on sites c2 and c3 ( respectively c1 and c4 ) are pointing in different directions . as in the case of ymn@xmath1o@xmath2 , there are only two `` orientation '' domains to consider , related by inversion symmetry and therefore contributing equally to the diffracted intensities .",
    "the symmetry operations and corresponding domains listed in table [ summetrytable ] are also valid for homn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "-mn@xmath29-mn@xmath28-mn@xmath28-mn@xmath29- ... chains in the _ ab_-plane .",
    "this is at variance with the structure proposed by munoz , in which there is a non - collinear arrangement of mn@xmath29 and mn@xmath28 moments within one afm chain .",
    "the angular deviation of the afm chains from the _ a_-axis ( @xmath208@xmath19 ) is less pronounced than in the ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2  compounds .",
    "also unlike ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2 , we found almost zero z - components for the mn@xmath29 moments .",
    "the magnetic point group is m2 m and the magnetic structures of the two possible domains are related by inversion symmetry , as previously described , resulting in flipping the central afm chain in fig .",
    "[ bi_ab ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the possible mechanism that will promote a ferroelectric state in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "first of all it is worth noting that irrespective of the microscopic mechanism involved , the point group symmetry m2 m derived from the magnetic structures of ymn@xmath1o@xmath2 , homn@xmath1o@xmath2 , and bimn@xmath1o@xmath2 , is consistent with ferroelectric order only along the _ b_-axis .",
    "secondly , it is important to discuss the possible microscopic mechanisms , in the light of the additional weak magnetic components observed along the _ c_-axis for ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2  and not identified previously by powder diffraction .",
    "this small out of plane component introduces a modulation that resembles a cycloid , even though it does not correspond to a homogeneous rotation from site to site , as seen in fig .",
    "[ y_ac ] for example .",
    "however , this modulation could in principle give rise to ferroelectricity based on antisymmetric exchange interaction , a mechanism proposed in several multiferroics , and its strength will be proportional to the spin - orbit coupling , potentially large for octahedral mn@xmath29 .",
    "obviously , the absence of such a modulation in bimn@xmath1o@xmath2 , multiferroic with a value of the electrical polarization comparable to ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2 , does not support this picture .",
    "therefore we argue that our model based on symmetric - exchange , and proposed initially in @xcite , is the principal mechanism driving ferroelectric order .",
    "the recent observation of electro - magnons@xcite active only for certain polarization directions , also supports a model based on symmetric - exchange interaction .",
    "this model is relevant since the magnetic configuration in the _ ab_-plane for the three compounds studied here is frustrated , i.e. the magnetic energy is invariant by flipping any afm chain in the lattice .",
    "such a configuration will induce atomic displacements on some of the ions in the crystal ( we speculated that mainly mn@xmath28 ions are involved based on structural anomalies related to this site ) that will lower the magnetic energy@xcite .",
    "this comes at the cost of elastic energy , quadratic with the displacement , but for small displacements the gain in magnetic energy ( linear with displacements ) overcomes the elastic energy cost .",
    "magneto - striction due to symmetric exchange should be much stronger than the dm interaction , which is a relativistic effect@xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that this later mechanism contributes to the total electric polarization in the ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2compounds but should be of minor importance .",
    "in fact , the two mechanisms are likely to be strongly coupled .",
    "it is important to note that applying the inversion symmetry operation not only flips one of the afm chains but also changes the rotation direction of the cycloidal modulation .",
    "therefore the direction of the electric polarization in domain two is opposite to that in domain one , whatever the mechanism considered .",
    "the observation of cycloidal structures for many of these compounds is intriguing , and is unlikely to be a coincidence . in general , two mechanisms",
    "are known to generate helicoidal - type structures ; competition between nearest and next - nearest neighbor interaction and direct dm interaction , resulting from the loss of a center of symmetry relating magnetic ions .",
    "it is easy to show that in none of the magnetic structures described here does the cycloidal modulation lower the next - near neighbor magnetic energy , regardless of the sign of the interaction .",
    "this suggests that the observed c - axis modulation may be the effect , rather than the cause , of the loss of the center of symmetry relating mn@xmath29 ions .",
    "the magnetic structures in the ferroelectric / commensurate magnetic regime of three compounds of the family _ _ r__mn@xmath7o@xmath8 with _ _ r__= y , ho , and bi , have been determined by single crystal neutron diffraction . for ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2 the main features of the magnetic structures are in agreement with previous models derived from powder neutron diffraction characterised , in particular , by collinear antiferromagnetic zig - zag chains in the _ ab_-plane .",
    "an additional small component of moment parallel to the _ c_-axis , and modulated in quadrature with the major components has been identified .",
    "this component was not detected in earlier experiments .",
    "the data also allow a more precise determination of the directions of the ho magnetic moments .",
    "these results indicate the importance of super - exchange interactions in the magnetic ordering of ho .",
    "the magnetic structure of bimn@xmath1o@xmath2  is very similar to that of the y and ho analogs , but with the magnetic moments more closely confined to the _ ab_-plane .",
    "it also contains zig - zag afm chains , in disagreement with what was previously reported@xcite .",
    "this comparative study strongly supports symmetric exchange as the principal mechanism leading to ferroelectricity since the small non - collinearity of the magnetic moments within chains along c is observed only for the ymn@xmath1o@xmath2  and homn@xmath1o@xmath2  compounds .",
    "this does not preclude a potential , but much weaker contribution from dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "we would like to thank b. ouladdiaf and g. mcintyre from the institut laue - langevin ( france ) for useful discussions , and the valuable help during the d10 experiment and the crystal alignment with the _ orientexpress _ instrument .",
