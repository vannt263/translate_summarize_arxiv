    "in atomic physics , the mean - field method describing the motion of electrons confined in the three - dimensional spherically symmetric coulomb potential of the nucleus provides an impressively powerful tool to explain the chemical inertness and special stability of the noble gases .",
    "the well - known atomic shell structure is a consequence of the fact that the atomic levels 1s , 2s , 2p , 3s , 3p , ... show a `` bunchiness '' in their distribution as a function of energy .",
    "particular stability of the electronic system is reached when a bunch of such levels is fully occupied .",
    "if then one more electron is added , the electron configuration would involve a singularly occupied orbital from the next higher shell , and consequently , the system is then less stable .",
    "shell filling is thus reflected by large maxima in the ionization energy for atomic numbers 2 , 10 , 18 ,  ... , corresponding to the nobel gas atoms he , ne , ar , ...  . in the mid - shell regions ,",
    "large level degeneracies occur as a consequence of the spherical symmetry of the confining potential of the atomic nucleus .",
    "the mid - shell levels are then filled according to hund s rules , in particular maximizing the total electron spin for half - filled orbitals  @xcite .",
    "a shell structure is not only unique to atoms , but actually is a recurring property in finite fermion systems with high symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it equally explains the occurence of `` magic '' proton and neutron numbers in the binding energies of nuclei , and more recently the discovery of `` magic '' atom numbers in metal clusters  @xcite  small aggregates of metal atoms in which delocalized valence electrons move in the positive charge background of the ions .",
    "fundamentally , in contrast to atoms , however , both mid - shell nuclei and clusters deform their mean field rather than obey hund s rules .    the two - dimensional analogue to the atom with its static @xmath0 radial coulomb confinement due to the nucleus",
    "can be realized in small semiconductor devices : artificial semiconductor atoms based on quantum dot technology .",
    "clean , well - defined , and highly symmetric vertical quantum dots ( `` islands '' ) can now be made so small that the dot size is comparable to the fermi - wavelength  @xcite .",
    "typical micrographs of micron - sized device mesas incorporating these dots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the lateral electrostatic confinement originates from side - wall depletion , and this ( and the effective dot size ) can be controlled or `` squeezed '' by the action of a schottky gate wrapped around the mesa in the vicinity of the dot to the degree that the number of electrons trapped on the dot can be changed one - by - one .",
    "also the few - electron regime is readily accessible , and then the resulting confinement is well approximated by a parabolic @xmath1 potential .",
    "electron phenomena in related semiconductor quantum dot structures continue to attract much attention  @xcite . as they exhibit atomic - like properties , such as a shell structure and shell filling in accordance with hund s first rule , the vertical quantum dots , whose heterostructure barriers are both abrupt and thin , can be regarded as artificial atoms whose ground and excited states can be probed electrically by single electron tunneling spectroscopy in order to perform novel `` atomic physics '' experiments in the few - electron regime  @xcite .    when an arbitrarily small bias , @xmath2 , is applied across the dot between the metal contact on top of the device mesa and the substrate contact (",
    "these are often refered to as the source and drain contacts ) , the ground states of an @xmath3electron quantum dot weakly coupled to the contacts can be investigated directly by monitoring the current flowing vertically through the dot at or below 0.3 k as the voltage on a single gate , @xmath4 , surrounding the dot is varied . when no current flows ( coulomb blockade ) , @xmath5 is well defined . on the other hand , when current flows the number of electrons can oscillate between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . with the gate , @xmath5 can be increased one - by - one starting from zero by making @xmath4 more positive , so a series of sharp current peaks due to the charging of the dot ( coulomb oscillations ) can be observed . for a large dot containing many electrons ,",
    "the coulomb oscillations are usually periodic because the single electron charging energy is determined classically just by the total dot capacitance . for a dot containing just a few electrons both",
    "quantum effects reflecting the underlying symmetry of the confining potential , and the details of the electron - electron interactions become important as the dot size is reduced .",
    "this leads to modifications of the coulomb oscillations , so they are no longer expected to be periodic  @xcite .    to date",
    ", we have mainly focused on the properties of dots in circular mesas which have diameters of typically 0.4 to 0.7 microns .",
    "for a magnetic field parallel to the current , the measured ground states between 0 t and about 4 t for @xmath7 in these disk - shaped dot can be well accounted for by a single - particle picture based on the darwin - fock spectrum for a circular two - dimensional harmonic confining potential , a constant interaction , and corrections at 0 t due to exchange , i.e. hund s first rule  @xcite . at higher fields beyond about 4 t , the evolution of ground states ( and also the excited states ) for @xmath8",
    "can be understood in terms of many - body effects  @xcite .",
    "the main theme of this article concerns the effect of geometrically distorting a circular dot into an elliptical ( anisotropic ) dot .",
    "previously , we have briefly reported some properties of elliptical dots  @xcite . here , we present a more detailed study of the addition energies and include their magnetic - field dependencies . the experimental data are compared to model calculations .",
    "we survey general trends , and examine basic assumptions about the nature of the deformed dots .",
    "a perfectly circular dot possesses full rotational symmetry .",
    "this high symmetry leads to maximal level degeneracy of the single - particle two - dimensional states for parabolic confinement , and this emphasises atomic - like properties  @xcite .",
    "this level degeneracy at 0 t for a circular dot is evident in the single - particle spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , and consecutive filling of each set of degenerate states is directly responsible for the characteristic shell structure with `` magic '' numbers @xmath92 , 6 , 12 , 20 ,  ... .",
    "furthermore , hund s first rule accounts for the parallel filling of electrons amongst half - filled degenerate states in a shell at numbers @xmath94 , 9 , 16 ,  ... due to an exchange effect . breaking the circular symmetry by deforming the lateral confining potential lifts the degeneracies of the single - particle levels present in a disk - shaped dot .",
    "this destroys the shell structure for a circle , and modifies other atomic - like properties  @xcite .    the sequence of spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] also introduces two key points in our subsequent arguments .",
    "firstly , as the deformation is gradually increased , ( a ) to ( d ) , degeneracies of the single - particle states at 0 t are generally removed .",
    "nevertheless , accidental degeneracies can occur at certain `` magic '' deformations , e.g. ( b ) and ( c ) , leading to subshell closures , provided the confining potential is still perfectly parabolic .",
    "the resulting patterns , however , are very different from that for the circular case , ( a ) , and in practice may be hard to observe .",
    "secondly , a weak magnetic field parallel to the current can also induce level degeneracies in both circular and elliptical dots when single - particle levels cross at finite field , but here too , any shell structure at a particular field is of a lower order and less apparent than that for the circle at 0 t  @xcite .    while illustrative , ultimately any modelling of the behavior of real dots must go beyond a system of @xmath5 non - interacting electrons confined by a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , i.e.  a single - particle picture , as employed to generate the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  @xcite , and include coulomb interactions which can lift certain degeneracies at 0 t. numerical diagonalization of the full hamiltonian matrix has recently been successfully employed to calculate basic electronic properties of dots with anisotropic confining potentials  @xcite .",
    "such `` exact '' numerical calculations , however , are limited to only a few confined particles . in order to study dots confining a larger number of electrons",
    "we apply spin - density functional theory at 0 t. this powerful technique , which explicitly incorporates the electron - spin interactions , has lead to a number of interesting predictions for the ground state structure of quantum dots , although there is a continuing discussion as to the interpretation of so - called spin - density waves ( sdw )  @xcite .",
    "both `` exact '' numerical calculations and spin - density functional theory predict subtle changes in the addition energy spectra , and transitions in the spin - states as deformation is varied  even for a weak deformation .",
    "an example of the latter is the breakdown of the conditions for which hund s first rule applies for four electrons , and this marks a transition from a spin - triplet to a spin - singlet configuration , i.e. states are consecutively filled by spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "the vertical quantum dots under focus in the following are fabricated by electron - beam lithography , and a two step etching technique to make circular or rectangular sub - micron mesas from one special gaas / al@xmath10ga@xmath11as / in@xmath12ga@xmath13as / al@xmath10 ga@xmath11as / gaas double barrier heterostructure ( dbh ) .",
    "full details of the device fabrication , and the material parameters are given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a single schottky gate is placed around the side of the mesa close to the dbh .",
    "we discuss one circular mesa with a nominal top contact diameter , @xmath14 , of 0.5 @xmath15 m ( w ) , and three rectangular mesas with a top contact area @xmath16 0.55 @xmath17 @xmath15m@xmath18 ( x ) , 0.65 @xmath19 @xmath15m@xmath18 ( y ) , and 0.6 @xmath17 @xmath15m@xmath18 ( z ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the nominal dimension of longest ( shortest ) side of the top contact .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows typical scanning electron micrographs of a circular mesa , and a rectangular mesa taken immediately after the depositon of the schottky gate metal surrounding the mesa . for the rectangular mesas ,",
    "an intuitively simple way to classify them is to define a geometric parameter , @xmath21 , to be the ratio @xmath22 . for x , y , and",
    "z respectively @xmath21 is nominally 1.375 , 1.44 and 1.5 . due to a slight isotropic undercut resulting from the light wet etch during the formation of the mesa  @xcite ,",
    "the area of the mesas , as revealed by the micrographs , is a little less than that of the top contact , so realistic values for @xmath21 are estimated to be about 5% larger than the values quoted .",
    "[ fig:1 ] also schematically shows the slabs of semiconductor between the two al@xmath10ga@xmath11as tunneling barriers , and the resulting dots bounded by the shaded depletion region for the circular and rectangular mesas .",
    "the thickness of the in@xmath12ga@xmath13as slab is determined by the separation between the well defined heterostructure tunneling barriers ( approximtely 100 ) .",
    "the slab is sufficiently thin that all electrons are in the lowest state in the vertical direction parallel to the current .",
    "the lateral confining potential due to the side wall depletion further restricts electrons to the center of the slab , thus defining the dot region .",
    "we note that in our devices , the extent of the lateral depletion region in the vicinity of the dot is largely determined by the electron density in the n - doped gaas regions above and below .    the lateral harmonic confining potential of the dot in the circular mesa has circular symmetry of a sufficiently high degree that degenerate sets of states can systematically form in the disk - shaped dot  @xcite .",
    "these states can be labelled by the quantum numbers ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) , where @xmath23 is the radial quantum number ( = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ) , and @xmath24 is the angular momentum quantum number @xmath25 .",
    "each state can hold a spin - up electron and a spin - down electron . at 0 t",
    "the @xmath26-th shell is made up of @xmath26 degenerate single - particle states .",
    "each degenerate set of states can be regarded as a shell of an artificial atom , and this is the origin of the 2 , 6 , 12 , 20 , ... `` magic '' numbers .",
    "the first shell consists of the ( 0,0 ) level , the second shell of the ( 0,1 ) and ( 0,-1 ) levels , the third shell of the ( 0,2 ) , ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,-2 ) levels , and so on . for the circular dots we typically study",
    ", the lateral electrostatic confinement energy seperating these degenerate sets of single - particle states , @xmath27 , can be as large as 5 mev in the few - electron limit  @xcite .",
    "neglecting an arbitary constant , the energy of single - particle state ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) is @xmath28 .",
    "the effective lateral diameter can be `` squeezed '' from a few thousand angstroms for @xmath5 of approximately 100 down to 0  for @xmath29 by making the gate voltage more negative  @xcite .",
    "we stress that crucially the `` squeezing '' action of the gate , and indeed application of a magnetic field parallel to the current , preserves the circular symmetry of a disk - shaped dot .",
    "consequently , atomic - like properties should be particularly robust and evident in circular dots .    for a rectangular mesa ,",
    "the lateral confining potential of the dot is expected to be elliptical - like due to rounding at the corners provided the number of electrons in the dot is not too large ( in which case it may be more rectangular - like with rounded corners ) , or too small .",
    "right at `` pinch - off '' , @xmath30 , it may even become more circular - like , i.e. the elliptical - shape of the confining potential may be changing in a complex way  @xcite . assuming the confining potential is perfectly parabolic , we can choose to characterize the `` ellipticity '' by a deformation parameter , @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath32 is the confinement energy at 0 t along the minor ( major ) axis ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the states in the elliptical dot are now labelled by the quantum numbers ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is a quantum number ( = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ) associated with the energy parabola along the major ( minor ) axis  @xcite . again neglecting an arbitary constant ,",
    "the energy of single - particle state ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) is ( @xmath34 + 1/2)@xmath36+(@xmath35 + 1/2)@xmath37 .    for a perfectly circular mesa",
    ", we can trivially generalize our definition of the deformation parameter so that @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , for the rectangular mesas , there is no simple correspondance between @xmath21 , a ratio of lengths characteristic of the top metal contact which is independent of gate voltage ( or @xmath5 ) , and @xmath39 , a ratio of energies characteristic of the dot in the mesa which is in fact dependent on the gate voltage ( or equivalently @xmath5 ) , i.e. `` accidental '' degeneracies at `` magic '' deformations will be hard to see over an extended range of @xmath5 , and in any case may be lifted if the confinement potential is not completely parabolic . nevertheless , at this stage , we start by assuming that @xmath21 is a measure of @xmath39 , and thus one might expect @xmath40 .",
    "we are not saying that @xmath41 for the ellipses , and indeed even for the simplest possible model of uniform depletion spreading due to the action of the gate , we would expect @xmath21 to underestimate @xmath39 .",
    "we furthermore assume in the following model calculations , for simplicity , that the `` squeezing '' action of the gate does not alter @xmath39 .",
    "we will examine these assumptions in light of the experimental and theoretical data presented .",
    "note that the application of a magnetic field parallel to the current effectively reduces @xmath39 as seen by the confined electrons in the limit of a very high field , where it approaches unity .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:3 ] , the change ( formally the second difference ) in the electro - chemical potential , @xmath42 , which can also be regarded as a capacitive energy  @xcite , is plotted as a function of electron number , @xmath5 , up to @xmath43 for ( a ) w , ( b ) x , ( c ) y , and ( d ) z at 0 t. the traces are offset vertically by 3  mev for clarity . the @xmath5th current peak position in gate voltage , v@xmath44 , at a very small bias ( @xmath45 mv ) , i.e. measured in the linear conductance regime , at or below 0.3 k reflects @xmath46 , the electro - chemical potential of the ground state for @xmath5 electrons , or equivalently the `` addition energy '' to place an extra electron on a dot with @xmath47 electrons.@xmath48 then mirrors directly the spacing in gate voltage between the @xmath6th and the @xmath5th current peaks  @xcite .",

    "the peaks at @xmath53 4 , 9 , 16 arise as a consequence of exchange effects which are enhanced at half - full shell filling with same - spin electrons for the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th shells respectively  @xcite",

    ", it is also evident that as @xmath5 is decreased , @xmath48 generally becomes larger due to the increase of the coulomb interaction when the dot is `` squeezed '' .",
    "this observation also holds for the rectangular mesas , but there are no prominant maxima at @xmath50(2,6,12 ) .",
    "the shell structure for the disk - shaped dot has now become disrupted or `` smeared out '' , and this can be attributed directly to the lifting of the degeneracies of the single - particle states that are present in a circular dot  @xcite . in other words , deformation kills the shell structure for a circle , and even quite a small deformation can make a big difference .",
    "this is evident from the three traces , ( b ) to ( d ) in fig .",

    "lastly , even if @xmath39 could be determined accurately , @xmath50(n ) strictly speaking can only be fairly compared if the `` areas '' of the dots are comparable , as in the classical limit @xmath48 is determined by the overall dot capacitance  @xcite .",
    "based on the nominal sizes of the mesas , and in line with the trends of the `` pinch - off '' gate voltage as identified by the position of the first current peak , elliptical dots x , y , and z respectively may have `` areas '' 1.1 , 1.5 and 1.2 larger than that of the circular dot w. thus to sensibly discuss details , like the spin - states , even generally , we first calculate @xmath59 at 0 t for a range of @xmath39 values in line with those suggested by the @xmath21 values of the mesas x , y , and z. we then compare with , and look for patterns in , the experimental data at 0 t , before looking at the magnetic field dependence for confirmation of trends , and whether @xmath57 is reasonable .",
    "we next aim to model the changes due to the deformation of the lateral confinement to the shell structure of the quantum dots at 0 t by applying the methods of spin - density functional theory ( sdft ) .",
    "we will briefly address different aspects of the spin structure relevant to the deformed quantum dots .      to obtain the ground - state energies and densities for @xmath5 electrons confined in an externally imposed potential , we solve the spin - dependent single - particle kohn - sham ( ks ) equations  @xcite @xmath60 \\psi_{i,\\sigma}({\\bf r } ) = \\epsilon_{i,\\sigma}\\psi_{i,\\sigma}({\\bf r } ) \\label{kseq}\\ ] ] in a plane - wave basis to avoid any symmetry restrictions . in eq.([kseq ] ) , the index @xmath61 accounts for the spin ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 .",

    "we point out that the sdft calculations described here , as well as those performed by hirose and wingreen  @xcite , are strictly two - dimensional , so the strength of the coulomb interactions may be overestimated , i.e. the possibility of charge spreading out in both the @xmath72-@xmath73plane , and along the vertical direction parallel to the current to minimize the coulomb energy is neglected .",

    "nevertheless , they find that electrons strongly confined in the vertical direction have a very strong two - dimensional character , and both approaches lead to the same qualitative conclusions .",
    "namely , the distinct shell - structure for a circle , as well as the spin - states , at 0 t are strongly modified with deformation .",
    "we now make a simple comparison between the experimentally measured traces for the change in the electro - chemical potential , @xmath48 , with those modelled theoretically .",

    "as expected , the circular- shaped confinement produces a spectrum with the familiar shell structure for a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , with shell closures at the `` magic '' numbers @xmath94 and 20 .",
    "at the average particle density corresponding to @xmath91 , these `` magic '' numbers arise from large gaps at the fermi surface and paired spins in each non - degenerate level , so the total spin is zero @xmath95 .",

    "hund s first rule correctly predicts the calculated @xmath97 spin - triplet state in which spins are aligned in the two highest partially occupied degenerate single - particle levels ( @xmath23,@xmath24)=(0,1 ) and ( 0,-1 ) , rather than the @xmath98 spin - singlet state in which the paired - spin electrons reside in either the ( 0,1 ) or ( 0,-1 ) levels .    deforming the confinement slightly by changing the deformation parameter to @xmath99 ( see trace ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , the calculation still predicts fairly clear shell closures at @xmath100 and 12 .",
    "these numbers can still be considered as `` magic '' , but the actual values of @xmath101 are noticeably suppressed , because degeneracies have been lifted  @xcite .",

    "already it is clear that even a very small deviation from perfect circular symmetry can have a very noticeable effect even when single - particle level degeneracies are lifted by just a small amount .",
    "as the deformation increases further , the pronounced peaks for @xmath532 , 6 , 12 , and 20 evident for the disk - shaped dot are further suppressed .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the removal of the level `` bunching '' with deformation . even for the cases where `` accidental '' subshell closures occur at certain `` magic '' deformations ( e.g. @xmath104 and 2 as seen in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , the reduced separation between degenerate single - particle energy levels ( @xmath36 ) would make any shell structure less clear to observe , and",

    "the spin - states in the elliptical dot x have also been confirmed directly by measuring the zeeman effect alone by applying a @xmath115-field perpendicular to the current , and the results are again consistent with a spin - singlet interpretation for @xmath96  @xcite .    the next most striking feature about traces ( b ) to ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is the position of the first up - moving pair of peaks . for mesas",
    "x , y , and z respectively , it is the 3rd , 5th , and 4th pair of peaks . as revealed by the sequence of spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , in a simple single - particle picture , the first up - moving state is ( @xmath34,@xmath35)=(0,1 ) , which is actually the lowest energy state of the second landau - level  @xcite",

    "thus , starting from no deformation , the first up - moving pair of peaks should go from the 3rd to 4th , 4th to the 5th , ... at certain `` magic '' deformations as @xmath39 is increased .",
    "remembering that coulomb effects are neglected in this simple picture , and that in practice @xmath39 is expected to vary with @xmath5 , nonetheless , with these simple arguements it looks as if @xmath139 for x , @xmath140 for y , @xmath141 for z. if we believe this , then even though ellipses x , y , and z are all deformed beyond the triplet - singlet transition , we are forced to conclude the following : @xmath54 @xmath39 can be much higher than that suggested by the @xmath21 values ( especially for y and z ) ; and @xmath55 the ordering given by increasing @xmath21 values may not reflect the true ordering in @xmath39 , i.e. the deformation in y seems to be stronger than in z , so the true sequence may be w  x  z  y for the four mesas considered . given our earlier comments , the former is not so unexpected since we have no independent way of measuring @xmath39 , but the latter is perhaps more surprising .",
    "if the true ordering of the ellipses is x , z , and y , even though the reason for the deformation in y being stronger than in z is unclear to us , at least other attributes of y and z , and trends in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] are consistent with this interpretation . for instance , @xmath110 for a w - x - z - y ordering respectively of 3.1 , 2.7 , 2.5 , and 3.1 mev is more in line with the predicted trend shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , although the value for z still seems a little low .",
    "this reordering does not contradict our earlier conclusion that , with the absense of deviations to normal pairing , @xmath96 is a spin - singlet state for all three ellipses .",
    "thus @xmath135 increases after the triplet - singlet transition , because with deformation the degeneracy of single - particle states is strongly lifted .",
    "the reversed ordering of ellipses y and z , as well as higher @xmath39 values than suggested by the @xmath21 values , also fits with the observations made earlier about traces ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , and traces ( g ) and ( h ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "both mesas show a tendency for @xmath48 to oscillate between slightly higher and slightly lower values respectively for even-@xmath5 and odd-@xmath5 and this seems more pronounced for y than z.",
    "we have experimentally and theoretically investigated the effect of ellipsoidal deformation on the shell structure , addition energies , and spin - states in vertical quantum dot atoms on going from circular- to rectangular - shaped mesas .",
    "the familiar and distinctive shell structure as determined from the addition energy spectra at 0 t for the circular dot is absent in the elliptical dots , and even small deviations breaking circular symmetry have a dramatic effect .",
    "measurements with a magnetic field applied parallel to current confirm that the @xmath96 spin state at 0 t has undergone a transition due to the moderate deformation : for the circular dot it is a spin - triplet in accordance with hund s first rule when the second shell is half - filled , and for the elliptical dots it is a spin - singlet .",
    "these observations are in agreement with recent theory , as well demonstrated here by the application of spin - density functional theory at 0 t with a wide range of deformation parameters .",
    "the @xmath115-field dependence strongly suggests that the anisotropy of an elliptical dot in practice can be significantly higher than that given by simply considering the geometry of the mesa in which the dot is situated . in the future",
    "it will be interesting to experiment with even more strongly- and extremely - deformed dots ( to clarify for instance the existance of @xmath98 sdw states ) , quasi - one - dimensional wire - like dots  @xcite , and possibly other exotically - shaped dots , for example ring - shaped dots  @xcite , and triangular - shaped dots  @xcite .",
    "finally , with these goals in mind , ultimately better control and in - situ manipulation of the lateral potential geometry of a quantum dot is highly desirable , and this may be achieved by fully exploiting a multiple - gated vertical single electron transistor we have recently developed  @xcite .",
