    "in a recent paper  @xcite it is explained how a simple twist in the original definition of spectral triple  @xcite makes it possible to deal with algebras with no ( or few ) traces .",
    "it was also suggested that this notion has potential applications to quantum groups and quantum homogeneous spaces , a domain where to construct a spectral triple may sometimes be problematic .",
    "we investigate the connection between twisted spectral triples and quantum homogeneous spaces using as guiding example the algebra @xmath1 of the quantum symplectic @xmath0-sphere constructed in  @xcite , on which up to now no spectral triples are known .",
    "a possible application of a ` twisted ' dirac operator is in the construction of a differential calculus , which in the particular case of @xmath2 is fundamental for the study of noncommutative instantons .",
    "another point is the study of the spectral action  @xcite on @xmath2 : a problem shared by most quantum homogeneous spaces is that the axioms for a ` real structure ' are fulfilled only modulo an ideal of ` infinitesimals ' , and we are not able to give meaning to the ` adjoint representation ' of @xmath3-forms ( see e.g.  @xcite , and  @xcite for a example which does nt suffer from this problem ) .",
    "we ll explain how the notion of real structure can be ( trivially ) extended to the case of twisted spectral triples , and then construct a real structure in the example of @xmath2 .",
    "we start with a reformulation of the notion of twisted spectral triple which seems to be appropriate when studying quantum homogeneous spaces .",
    "we call the data @xmath4 a _ twisted spectral triple _ if ( i ) @xmath5 is a complex associative involutive algebra with unity ( for short _ @xmath6-algebra _ ) represented by bounded operators on a separable hilbert space @xmath7 , ( ii ) @xmath8 is a ( unbounded ) selfadjoint operator on @xmath7 with dense domain and compact resolvent , ( iii ) @xmath9 is an invertible linear operator on @xmath10 , ( iv ) the ` @xmath3-form ' @xmath11 extends to a bounded operator on @xmath7 for any @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath9 is the identity , one gets the original definition of spectral triple  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath9 is bounded the data @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is a @xmath16-spectral triple in the sense of  @xcite , i.e.  @xmath17 has compact resolvent and @xmath18 is bounded ( being equal to @xmath19 ) ; notice that not all automorphisms @xmath16 are implementable , so the notion of @xmath16-spectral triple of  @xcite is more general .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath20 are both bounded , we can ` untwist ' the dirac operator by defining @xmath21 ; since @xmath22 has compact resolvent and @xmath23=k^2{\\mathrm{d}}a$ ] is bounded , the data @xmath24 is an ordinary spectral triple . as usual , we will refer to @xmath8 as the ` dirac operator ' , in analogy with the commutative situation where spectral triples are canonically associated to spin structures .",
    "moreover , we ll identify @xmath5 with its representation and omit the representation symbol .",
    "in this paper we construct a triple over the quantum symplectic @xmath0-sphere @xmath2 which satisfies all the axioms of a twisted spectral triple , but for the compact resolvent condition . to compute the spectrum of the dirac operator is not an easy task , mainly because @xmath1 has no known symmetries and we can not use the powerful tools of representation theory . we stress that the compact resolvent condition has no role in the construction of the differential calculus associated to @xmath8 ( not even in the construction of the spectral action ) , which we describe in the following .    given a twisted spectral triple @xmath4 , a differential calculus @xmath25",
    "can be constructed as explained in  @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath26 as the @xmath27-graded algebra generated by degree @xmath28 elements @xmath12 and degree @xmath3 elements @xmath29 given by ( [ eq : dea ] ) , @xmath30 , with @xmath5-bimodule structure @xmath31 where @xmath32 and for all @xmath12 , @xmath33 ( on the right hand sides the multiplication in @xmath34 is understood ) .",
    "thanks to the modified bimodule structure , the leibniz rule is satisfied @xmath35    the notion of even and real spectral triple can be extended in a straightforward way to the twisted case .",
    "a ( twisted ) spectral triple is called _ even _ if there exists a @xmath36-grading @xmath37 on @xmath7 ( i.e.  a bounded selfadjoint operator satisfying @xmath38 ) such that the dirac operator is odd and the algebra @xmath5 is even : @xmath39 a _ real structure _ on a ( twisted ) spectral triple is a bounded antilinear operator @xmath40 on @xmath7 satisfying @xmath41 and such that for all @xmath42 @xmath43=0\\;,\\qquad [ \\,{\\mathrm{d}}a , jbj^{-1}]=0\\;.\\ ] ] we refer to last equation as the ` first order condition ' .",
    "if the spectral triple is even , we impose the further condition @xmath44 .",
    "the signs ` @xmath45 ' in previous equations are determined by the dimension of the geometry  @xcite ; a real spectral triple of dimension @xmath0 , for example , corresponds to the choices @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    for the reader s ease , we recall also the notions of module algebra and of crossed product algebra ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which will be used throughout the paper .",
    "let @xmath5 be a @xmath6-algebra and @xmath49 a @xmath6-hopf algebra .",
    "we say that @xmath5 is a ( left ) @xmath50-module @xmath6-algebra if there is a ( left ) action ` @xmath51 ' of @xmath50 on @xmath5 satisfying @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a ( left ) @xmath50-module @xmath6-algebra , the ( left ) crossed product @xmath54 is defined as the @xmath6-algebra generated by @xmath5 and @xmath50 with crossed commutation relations @xmath55 right module algebras and right crossed product algebras are defined similarly . as usual",
