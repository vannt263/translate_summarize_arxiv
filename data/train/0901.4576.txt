    "in the standard cosmological paradigm , present - day structures arise from small - amplitude density perturbations which have their origin in the very early universe .",
    "these primordial perturbations are presumed to form a gaussian random field whose statistical properties are described entirely by the power spectrum , @xmath8 . while higher order statistics are required to describe the density field once nonlinearities develop , the power spectrum remains central to our understanding of structure formation .    during the radiation - dominated phase of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , the power spectrum evolves from its primordial , approximately power - law form , @xmath9 to one in which its logarithmic slope , @xmath10 , decreases from @xmath11 on large scales to @xmath12 on small scales to @xmath13 _ logarithmic corrections _ where @xmath14 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "an analysis of the three - year wmap data by @xcite indicates that @xmath15 .",
    "however , for the sake of argument , we will set @xmath16 since the difference is not relevant for our discussion . ] . at the start of the matter - dominated phase , which signals the beginning of structure formation , the dimensionless power spectrum , @xmath17 , decreases monotonically with scale .",
    "the implication is that structure forms from the bottom up .",
    "hierarchical clustering , as this process has come to be known , is the central idea in our understanding of structure formation .",
    "hierarchical clustering also explains why cosmological n - body simulations are able to provide a reasonable facsimile of true cosmological evolution ; with enough dynamic range , simulations are able to follow the development of virialized , highly nonlinear systems on small scales while properly modeling the large - scale tidal fields that shape them .",
    "however , the dynamic - range requirement becomes increasingly difficult to achieve as @xmath18 since , in this limit , @xmath19 becomes independent of @xmath7 and structures collapse nearly simultaneously across a wide range of scales .",
    "put another way , as @xmath20 , the infrared divergence of the power spectrum becomes increasingly problematic for numerical ( as well as theoretical ) studies .",
    "interest in the small - scale limit of the cdm hierarchy was prompted by the realization that dark matter halos have a wealth of substructure @xcite and that this substructure may have important implications for both direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution simulations suggest that the subhalo mass function extends down to the dark matter free - streaming scale with approximately constant mass in substructure per logarithmic mass interval . these simulations probe structures which form from an initial power spectrum with @xmath21 .",
    "for example , in the simulation of the first cdm objects by @xcite , @xmath22 . with such extreme spectra , care must be taken in order to insure that the results are not corrupted by finite - volume effects .",
    "this issue , as it relates to the halo and subhalo mass functions , is discussed in @xcite and @xcite as well as in the companion to this paper , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide insight into the small - scale limit of cdm by focusing on scale - free cosmologies , that is einstein - de sitter cosmologies where the initial power spectrum is a power - law function of @xmath7 , @xmath23 .",
    "the guiding principle for understanding structure formation in these models is self - similar scaling which implies that the functional form of the dimensionless power spectrum is time - independent , up to a rescaling of the wavenumber @xmath7 ( see below ) .",
    "self - similar scaling provides a diagnostic test of whether a simulation has sufficient dynamic range @xcite .",
    "contact with the standard @xmath24cdm cosmology is made by treating parameter @xmath25 as a proxy for scale : @xmath26 corresponds to cluster scales and @xmath27 to galactic scales .",
    "the limit @xmath28 corresponds to the bottom of the cdm hierarchy .",
    "we perform n - body simulations with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and compare our results directly with theoretical models . the computation costs to conduct credible simulations with @xmath31 are prohibitively high ( see below ) and",
    "even our @xmath32 results must be considered suspect because of finite box - size effects .",
    "we compare our results for the power spectra in the quasilinear regime with predictions from one - loop perturbation theory and demonstrate that for @xmath4 and @xmath33 , the agreement is vastly improved if one implements the renormalization - group approach suggested by @xcite .",
    "to predict the full non - linear power spectrum , one must resort to semi - analytic models such as the ones described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the stable - clustering hypothesis @xcite which holds that gravitationally - bound systems decouple from the rest of the universe once they collapse .",
    "an alternative , known as the ` halo model ' @xcite , allows for the continual accretion of mass onto existing haloes .",
    "the density field is treated as a distribution of mass concentrations , each characterized by a density profile . the power spectrum",
    "then involves the convolution of this density profile with the halo mass function .",
    "simulations by @xcite of structure formation in a number of scale - free cosmologies demonstrate a clear departure from the stable clustering hypothesis and appear to support the halo model , at least qualitatively .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide fitting formulae for nonlinear power spectra . formally , these formulae apply to all initial power spectra with @xmath34 though they are calibrated using simulations with @xmath35",
    ". one goal of this paper is to provide an alternative fitting formula which applies when @xmath36 .",
    "the overall layout of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we present background material including a discussion of self - similar scaling , perturbation theory , and semi - analytic models .",
    "we describe our simulations in  3 and our results in  4 .",
    "we also provide a new and improved fitting formula for the nonlinear power spectra . in  5 , we discuss the implications of our results for the halo model and stable clustering hypothesis .",
    "we conclude , in  6 , with a summary and a discussion of directions for future investigations .",
    "in keeping with standard definitions ( _ e.g. _ peacock 1999 ) , we express real - space density perturbations as deviations from the mean background density , @xmath37 , and then construct the @xmath7-space representation as follows : @xmath38 the power spectrum , @xmath8 , ( strictly speaking a spectral density ) is defined by the relation , @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes an ensemble average , @xmath41 is the dirac delta function , and where the @xmath42-dependence is dropped for notational simplicity . note that both @xmath43 and @xmath44 have units of volume .",
    "so long as the density field is statistically isotropic , @xmath45 encapsulates the wavenumber dependence .",
    "a useful quantity is the dimensionless power spectrum , @xmath46 , which measures the power per logarithmic wavenumber bin .",
    "given these definitions , the wavenumber at which @xmath47 corresponds to the dividing line between the linear and nonlinear scales .",
    "initial conditions for our n - body simulations are specified at an early epoch when the density field is accurately described by linear perturbation theory .",
    "we assume that prior to this epoch , the power spectrum is a power - law function of @xmath7 between appropriately chosen high and low wavenumber cutoffs .",
    "that is , @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 is the scale factor , and @xmath51 is a normalization constant .",
    "( here and throughout , we assume an einstein - de sitter cosmology . for other cosmological models ,",
    "@xmath50 is replaced by the linear growth factor , @xmath52 . ) the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 truncate the power spectrum above @xmath55 and below @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the size of the simulation `` box '' and @xmath60 is the nyquist wavenumber of the initial particle distribution .",
    "we also follow @xcite in using the truncation functions @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the heaviside function . a similar initial set - up",
    "is used in our renormalization group calculations ( see section [ qlregime ] ) .",
    "our assumptions imply that at this early epoch @xmath63 , so that all modes within the simulation or computation box are initially in the linear regime .    utilizing these definitions",
    ", we describe the nonlinear scale @xmath64 by the condition @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath66 . since @xmath67 is the only preferred length scale , the power spectrum should evolve according to the self - similar scaling ansatz @xmath68 ( see @xcite for a discussion and review of the literature ) . note that since @xmath69 , we can also write @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 .      the evolution of the power spectrum from the linear regime to the mildly nonlinear or quasilinear regime can be estimated via perturbation theory ( pt , see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the starting point is an expansion for the density perturbation field of the form : @xmath72 where @xmath50 is again the scale factor , @xmath73 characterizes linear density fluctuations , and @xmath74 denote terms of order @xmath75 .",
    "so long as the density field is statistically isotropic , the perturbative expansion can be written in terms of the power spectrum : @xmath76 where @xmath77 . in practice ,",
    "the series is rarely carried beyond second order in @xmath78 .",
    "the calculations are aided by a diagrammatic scheme in which the higher - order terms are described as `` loop corrections '' to the `` tree - level '' term , @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the one - loop correction , @xmath79 , comprises two distinct terms or diagrams , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these terms involve integrals over the linear power spectrum , @xmath78 .",
    "explicit expressions can be found in @xcite , @xcite and elsewhere . for scale - free models ,",
    "they combine to give @xmath82 where @xmath83 , which can be calculated analytically , is positive for @xmath84 and negative for @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath86 represents a `` critical index '' where nonlinear corrections are vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "pt breaks down when the loop corrections , which are formally divergent , become comparable to the tree - level terms .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) scheme proposed by @xcite alleviates this problem essentially by updating the perturbative expansion as the system evolves .",
    "rg removes the divergences in the pt expansion , leaving behind a well - behaved , renormalized power spectrum .",
    "operationally , one begins with an initial power spectrum and takes a small step forward in time using one - loop perturbation theory .",
    "the new power spectrum is used as the initial condition for the next timestep .",
    "this procedure is accomplished by solving the integro - differential equation @xmath87 with the initial conditions , @xmath88 . here , @xmath89 and @xmath90 with the proviso that @xmath91 rather than @xmath78",
    "is used in evaluating @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "details on our own scheme for solving this equation are given in section [ qlregime ] .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the method has a number of limitations .",
    "in particular , eq.[eq : rgequation ] ignores higher - order terms ( two - loop and beyond ) in @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , decaying mode solutions are not included .",
    "thus , our rg results should be interpreted with a degree of caution .",
    "the approach described here is an example of how rg techniques can be used to remove secular divergences in differential equations . @xcite and @xcite outline an alternative method to study the nonlinear evolution of large - scale structure which also employs rg techniques .",
    "their formalism is conveniently represented in terms of feynmann diagrams and is closer in spirit to rg applications in high energy and statistical physics .",
    "n - body simulations provide the most direct means to determine the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "the so - called hklm procedure provides an avenue by which one can begin to understand the simulation results from a theoretical basis @xcite .",
    "the approach yields fitting formulae for the nonlinear power spectrum ( or two - point correlation function , @xmath94 ) in different cosmological models .",
    "the key assumption is the existence of a one - to - one relation between the nonlinear power spectrum at wavenumber @xmath7 and the linear power spectrum at an earlier epoch and smaller wavenumber , @xmath95 .",
    "the starting point is the mapping @xmath96 which is the analogue of the real - space relation , @xmath97 that results from associating the volume averaged correlation function , @xmath98 , with the local over - density .",
    "the nonlinear power spectrum may then be written as a function of the linear power spectrum at the earlier epoch : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is an appropriately chosen fitting formula and , by assumption , @xmath101 .",
    "note that for scale - free models , eq .",
    "[ eq : kmapping ] together with eq .",
    "[ eq : selfsim ] implies eq .",
    "[ eq : hklm ] . in the linear regime @xmath102 must be the identity function , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath103 , and the power spectrum grows with the scale factor as @xmath104 . in the nonlinear regime , @xcite and @xcite",
    "appeal to the `` stable clustering hypothesis '' , which holds that highly nonlinear structures decouple from the expansion . under this assumption ,",
    "@xmath105 and the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath102 must be given by @xmath106 .",
    "to estimate @xmath102 , @xcite advocate the fitting formula @xmath107 where the parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath59 are determined by fitting eq.[eq : pd ] to power spectra measured in simulations .",
    "the parameters are understood as follows : @xmath59 determines a second - order departure from linear growth , @xmath51 and @xmath108 control the behaviour in the quasilinear regime , @xmath111 controls the amplitude of the asymptote and @xmath109 shapes the transition between the two regimes .",
    "best - fit parameters are expressed as functions of @xmath112 , for example , @xmath113 .",
    "the expressions for the other parameters similarly diverge as @xmath28 though one must bear in mind that they are based on results from simulations with @xmath35 .",
    "the assumption of stable clustering has been challenged by various groups @xcite on the basis that dark matter haloes continually accrete matter and never fully decouple from the rest of the universe .",
    "an alternative approach is provided by the halo model in which the density field is given as a distribution of mass concentrations ( haloes ) which evolve and have their own internal structure .",
    "the two - point correlation function comprises a one - halo term , which is associated with the correlation of mass within a single halo , and a two - halo term , which is associated with the correlation between different haloes @xcite . since the power spectrum is the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function , the associated components of the power spectrum , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , involve integrals over the halo mass function and fourier - transformed halo density profile .",
    "we return to this point in section 5 .    motivated in part by the separation of components used in the halo model , @xcite construct a fitting formula in the form @xmath116 for the power spectra measured in their simulations . by construction",
    ", @xmath117 dominates the power spectrum in the quasilinear regime and is meant to account for halo - halo correlations while @xmath118 dominates the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime and is meant to account for single halo correlations .",

    "initial conditions are generated on a regular grid using a second order - lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) code @xcite .",
    "the primary benefit of 2lpt is to reduce the impact of spurious transient modes which arise from the truncation of the perturbative expansion . since these modes decay",

    "in this section , we explore the halo model vis -  - vis our simulation results in more detail .",
    "our focus here is on the high-@xmath7 limit of the nonlinear power spectrum where the one - halo term dominates .",
    "the term can be expressed as an integral over the halo mass function , @xmath186 , and the fourier - transformed density profile of a single halo , @xmath187 .",
    "following @xcite , we use the peak height @xmath188 as the integration variable where @xmath189 is the critical overdensity for spherical collapse ( @xmath190 in an einstein - de sitter universe ) and @xmath191 is the rms mass overdensity for a spherical region of radius @xmath192 . for scale - free models , @xmath193 .",
    "one finds @xmath194 ^ 2\\,d\\nu~.\\ ] ] where @xmath195 is a dimensionless form for the halo mass function .",
    "a commonly used fitting formulae for halo density profiles take the form @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 @xcite . the characteristic halo scale length , @xmath199 , depends on the halo mass through the relation @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the virial radius and @xmath202 is the halo concentration parameter .",
    "cosmological simulations indicate that the concentration parameter decreases with mass , roughly as a power - law ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . with this in mind , we follow @xcite and @xcite and write @xmath203 so that @xmath204 .",
    "our focus is on the power spectrum in the high-@xmath7 limit where the fourier transform of @xmath205 may be approximated by a step function , @xmath206 ( at wavenumbers above @xmath207 , @xmath208 decreases as @xmath209 but the heaviside function provides a suitable form for our discussion . ) @xcite and @xcite provide analytic expressions for @xmath210 . in the small-@xmath211 limit ( i.e. , small @xmath212 or large @xmath7 limit ) , one finds @xmath213 where @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) for @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "putting all this together , we find that in the large-@xmath7 limit @xmath216 where @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that @xmath218 is independent of the cusp parameter @xmath108 indicating that the power spectrum in the strongly nonlinear regime is insensitive to the structure of the inner halo .    in figure",
    "[ fig : asymslope ] we plot our results for the asymptotic slope of the nonlinear power spectrum , @xmath219 , together with those from the @xcite simulations .",
    "we make the point of displaying our results as upper bounds on @xmath219 since the slope of @xmath182 appears to be a decreasing function of @xmath7 as @xmath220 ( see figures [ fig : delration1]-[fig : delration25 ] ) . for @xmath3 and @xmath119 , these bounds agree with the quoted values from the @xcite simulations .",
    "furthermore , the functional dependence of @xmath219 on @xmath25 from their fitting formula appears to be consistent with our @xmath5 and @xmath6 results .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath182 increases with increasing @xmath25 and that @xmath221 . in other words , as @xmath28 , the nonlinear dimensionless power spectrum becomes independent of @xmath7 ( i.e. , equal power per logarithmic wavenumber bin ) just as with the linear power spectrum .",
    "formulations of the halo model with constant , nonzero @xmath109 can not reproduce this behaviour . to illustrate this point , we plot these predictions for @xmath222 assuming @xmath223 , as in @xcite , and either the @xcite or @xcite values for @xmath224 .",
    "these predictions are inconsistent with our simulation results and those of @xcite .",
    "clearly , the dependence of the concentration parameter on halo mass is central to the development of the halo model .",
    "@xcite devised a toy model to explain the concentration - mass relation seen in simulations . in the case of scale - free cosmologies",
    "their model predicts @xmath225 which , when combined with eq.[asymptotic ] , would seem to yield the desired behaviour for @xmath226 in the @xmath28 limit .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ fig : asymslope ] shows this prediction .",
    "while it does better than constant-@xmath109 versions of the halo model , the predicted @xmath219 tends to lie above the values obtained in the simulation .",
    "the fundamental tenet of the hierarchical clustering scenario is that small - scale objects form earlier than large - scale ones .",
    "a corollary of this statement is that individual structures can be identified with a specific wavenumber range of the primordial power spectrum according to their mass . in cdm cosmologies , the logarithmic slope or spectral index of the primordial power spectrum runs from 1 at large scales to -3 at small scales .",
    "thus , as we increase the dynamic range in our simulations and push to smaller and smaller scales , we probe structures that form from density perturbations with a power spectrum approaching @xmath227 .",
    "however this limit represents a singular case where the dimensionless power spectrum is independent of scale and structures across a wide range in mass collapse nearly simultaneously .",
    "the nature of structure formation changes and the computing requirements for performing simulations increase dramatically .",
    "this work and our companion paper , @xcite , provide inside into the underlying physics of @xmath24cdm models by considering scale - free cosmologies .",
    "we focus here on the nonlinear power spectrum and in @xcite , on the distribution of subhaloes .",
    "the evolution of the power spectrum in scale - free cosmologies is remarkably simple  the dimensionless power spectrum , when written as a function of the ratio @xmath154 , is time - independent .",
    "obviously in simulations , the finite computation volume breaks the scale - free nature of the problem and leads to departures from the scaling solution .",
    "the dimensionless power spectrum provides a simple test of whether finite volume effects have corrupted the simulation @xcite .",
    "our high - resolution @xmath228 and @xmath33 simulations demonstrate the scaling solution across the simulation volume while showing clear differences with simulations performed at lower resolution . moreover , our results differ markedly from the the fitting formula provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a plausible power spectrum for @xmath6 was constructed by stitching together outputs from different timesteps .",
    "though it shows significant , and entirely expected departures from the scaling solution , it represents our best estimate of the power spectrum for models with @xmath25 this small .",
    "we summarize our results for our four high - resolution simulations by means of a simple fitting formula .",
    "future work will fill in the gaps in @xmath25 ( e.g. , @xmath229 and @xmath230 ) and enable use to develop a model for power spectra of arbitrary @xmath25 and therefore arbitrary shape .",
    "the renormalization group improvements to perturbation theory developed in @xcite represent a promising avenue for studying scale - free models with @xmath231 and likewise , the low - mass limit of the cdm hierarchy .",
    "not surprisingly , the calculations become more difficult as @xmath28 .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath4 and @xmath33 cases confirms mcdonald s claim that rg does lead to an improvement in the predictions of perturbation theory when compared to simulations with the caveat that , as @xmath25 becomes more negative , the rg - predicted power spectrum fails to capture the rapid rise of the power spectrum seen in the simulations .",
    "our analysis for the @xmath6 case is less conclusive but departures in the simulations from the scaling solution suggest that the problem may reside there rather than in the pt analysis . in principle , rg - improved pt can yield a handle on the form of the power spectrum in the mildly nonlinear regime even as @xmath28 .",
    "the halo model provides a theoretical framework for understanding the two - point correlation function and nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "our results , with respect to this model , are somewhat inconclusive .",
    "we agree with @xcite that the stable clustering hypothesis of @xcite and @xcite fails . on the other hand",
    ", the halo model appears to have difficulty reproducing the relation between the asymptotic slope of the power spectrum and @xmath25 .",
    "we must therefore settle for an empirical fitting formula for the nonlinear power spectrum .",
