    "the success of the standard model in describing the experimental information to date suggests that possible deviations have to be pursued either at high - energy scales or as small effects in low - energy variables . in the standard model , cp violation ( cpv ) and flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc )",
    "are expected to be small in charm decay , while lepton - family number violation and lepton - number violation are forbidden .",
    "anomalously large rates for rare decays would imply non - standard model tree - level fcnc diagrams or non - standard model contributions to higher - order loop diagrams , which make them sensitive to high - mass gauge bosons and fermions and allow for probing particle states and mass scales not directly accessible @xcite .",
    "the study of fcnc has been mainly dedicated to transitions such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as phenomena such as @xmath7@xmath8 and @xmath9@xmath10 mixing .",
    "the analogous fcnc processes in the charm sector have been investigated less .",
    "the standard - model expectations for both @xmath11@xmath12 mixing and fcnc are very small , while extensions of the standard model may enhance the contributions , which can then be orders of magnitude larger . in the standard model ,",
    "the @xmath13 system is not as sensitive to cp as the @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons . in this case too , the small predicted effects could leave open a window to the observation of new - physics effects .",
    "charm decays may be the only window onto such new physics since it is possible that the mechanism responsible will only couple to up - type quarks .",
    "more specifically , non - standard - model forces might exhibit very different patterns for the up and down classes of quarks @xcite .",
    "charm decays are the only up - type decays that afford a probe of such physics : non - strange light - flavor hadrons do not allow for oscillations and top - flavored hadrons do not even form in a practical way . in table  [ tab : expnow ] experiments that have already published results on charm mixing , rare decays and cpv searches are listed , along with their characteristics and a reference sample .",
    ".a comparison of the lep experiments , cdf , e791 , focus , cleo , babar and belle .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of reconstructed @xmath17 used in the published measurements .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the proper time resolution for charm hadrons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath19 dalitz projections are shown in fig .",
    "[ dp_proj_kmatrix ] . the fit c.l . is 7.7% .",
    "the most interesting feature of these results is the fact that the better treatment of the @xmath20-wave contribution provided by the _ k - matrix _ model can reproduce the low - mass @xmath21 structure of the @xmath19 dalitz plot .",
    "this suggests that any @xmath22-like object in the @xmath13 decay should be consistent with the same @xmath22-like object measured in the @xmath21 scattering .",
    "additional studies with higher statistics will be required to completely understand the @xmath22 puzzle .",
    "it is interesting to recall the close analogy between the @xmath23 channel and the @xmath24 one , which is a good candidate to measure the angle @xmath25 of the standard model unitarity triangle ; the analysis of @xmath24 will proceed through a time - dependent dalitz - plot analysis of the three - pion final state and will likely present similar parametrization complications .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ formalism has been applied for the first time to the charm sector in the focus dalitz - plot analyses of the @xmath28 and @xmath27 final states .",
    "the results are extremely encouraging since the same _ k - matrix _ description gives a coherent picture of both two - body scattering measurements in light - quark experiments _ as well as _",
    "charm meson decay .",
    "this result was not obvious beforehand .",
    "furthermore , the same model is able to reproduce features of the @xmath27 dalitz plot that otherwise would require an _",
    "@xmath22 resonance .",
    "in addition , the non - resonant component of each decay seems to be described by known two - body @xmath20-wave dynamics without the need to include constant amplitude contributions .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ treatment of the @xmath20-wave component of the decay amplitude allows for a direct interpretation of the decay mechanism in terms of the five virtual channels considered : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by inserting @xmath34 in the decay amplitude , @xmath35 , @xmath36 we can view the decay as consisting of an initial production of the five virtual states which then scatter via the physical @xmath37 into the final state .",
    "the _ q - vector _ contains the production amplitude of each virtual channel in the decay .",
    "the resulting picture , for both @xmath28 and @xmath19 decay , is that the @xmath20-wave decay is dominated by an initial production of @xmath31 , @xmath38 and @xmath30 states .",
    "dipion production is always much smaller .",
    "this suggests that in both cases the @xmath20-wave decay amplitude primarily arises from a @xmath39 contribution such as that produced by the cabibbo - favored weak diagram for the @xmath28 and one of the two possible singly cabibbo - suppressed diagrams for the @xmath19 . for the @xmath19 ,",
    "the @xmath39 contribution competes with a @xmath40 contribution . that the @xmath41 appears as a peak in the @xmath29 mass distribution in @xmath19 decay , as it does in @xmath42 decay , shows that for the @xmath20-wave component the @xmath43 contribution dominates  @xcite .",
    "comparing the relative @xmath20-wave fit fractions that we observe for @xmath28 and @xmath19 reinforces this picture . the @xmath20-wave decay fraction for the @xmath28 ( 87% ) is larger than that for the @xmath19 ( 56% ) . rather than coupling to an @xmath20-wave dipion",
    ", the @xmath40 piece prefers to couple to a vector state like @xmath44 that alone accounts for @xmath45 % of @xmath19 decay .",
    "this interpretation also bears on the role of the annihilation diagram in the @xmath46 decay .",
    "this study suggests that the @xmath20-wave annihilation contribution is negligible over much of the dipion mass spectrum",
    ". it might be interesting to search for annihilation contributions in higher spin channels , such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "dedicated studies of charm physics are foreseen in the near future at existing collider facilities such as cleo - c , the @xmath15-factories , and the tevatron .",
    "other facilities might also play a role , such as gsi and super @xmath15-factories . in parallel ,",
    "the mature stage of the ongoing analysis is providing warnings and lessons on how to perform proper studies to interpret and understand heavy flavor phenomenology and , hopefully , to find signs of new physics .",
