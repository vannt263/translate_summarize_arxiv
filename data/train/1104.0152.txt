    "the term involving @xmath63 is similar to what one gets in the presence of a cosmological constant .",

    "it is due to the nonzero @xmath39 which is the value of the potential at its extremum around which we expand it . in the einstein s equation ( 2 ) , this appears as an effective cosmological constant term which is essentially the scalar field constant energy density . although in the solutions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , this term gives a @xmath63 contribution , typical for a cosmological constant , but the solutions does not reduce to the de - sitter solution for @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",

    "the effective gravitational constant @xmath71 in this case , can be written as g_eff= ( 1 + + + ) the post - newtonian parameter @xmath0 for this case is found to be = [ gammaphiphi ]",
    "in order to constrain the model parameters , we use the recent measurement of time delay @xmath91 of the radio waves transmission near the solar conjunction by the cassini spacecraft @xcite .    the delay in time taken for the signal to travel the round trip distance between a ground based antenna and a reflector placed in a spacecraft",

    "using equations ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) , we now put constraints on the model parameters using the bound on @xmath1 mentioned above .    in figure 1 ( _ left _ ) , we show the constraint on the parameter @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the case of linear coupling . for this",
    "we assume a particular value for @xmath105 .",
    "one should keep in mind that these two parameters are related to the energy scale and the mass scale of the potential .",
    "so the allowed region actually constraints the shape of the potential around its extremum .    similarly in figure 1",
    "( _ right _ ) , we show the same constraint for the conformal coupling case with the same value of @xmath35 . comparing these two figures",
    ", one can say that in the conformal coupling case , smaller mass for the scalar field is allowed for the same range of scalar field energy density .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the solar system constrain on the scalar tensor theories having a nonstandard action for the scalar field .",
    "we consider the linear ( same as bd case ) as well as the conformal couplings case . in both the cases , the newtonian potential is corrected by a term which goes as square of the distance , typical in presence of a cosmological constant . in our case , this term is due to nonzero scalar field energy density at the extremum .",
    "this is in addition to the well known exponentially suppressed correction which depends on the effective mass of the scalar field .",
    "next we calculate the ppn parameter @xmath0 in our model and have shown that together with the usual exponential correction term , there is another term which has @xmath63 dependence .",
    "the exponential correction term comes together with a factor which is similar to @xmath106 as in bd case .",
    "but unlike the bd case where @xmath62 is an independent parameter , here it depends upon the potential parameters .",
    "we also calculate the actual time delay for the signal to travel the round trip distance between a ground based antenna and a reflector placed in a spacecraft due to gravitational field of the sun for our model . using the measurement of this time delay by the cassini mission",
    ", we find the allowed region for our parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 which essentially control the shape of the potential around its extrema .",
    "hence local gravity tests like time delay meaurements can be useful in constraining the shape of the potentials for scalar fields having nonstandard actions and nonminimally coupled to the gravity sector .",
