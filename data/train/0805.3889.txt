    "comparison with the same calculation in the uncorrelated disorder case@xcite reveals the increased stability range of insulating regions for correlated disorder .",
    "the effect of disorder on 1d fermions and in particular transitions between different phases can also be assessed through the thermodynamic properties . for this purpose",

    "we show @xmath80 as a function of @xmath1 for various values of the disorder correlation length @xmath17 .",

    "secondly , a large enhancement of @xmath80 at low density is observed .",
    "this is reminiscent of a similar behavior found in 2d electron systems .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases the atoms mostly occupy the deepest valleys in the disorder landscape , thus the high density regions in the system tend to become disconnected . for a given interaction strength @xmath81 and low @xmath1 the system stiffens as disorder grows . in the present situation",
    "we observe that with increasing correlation length @xmath17 the low density enhancement in @xmath80 is diminished . the basic reason for this behavior",
    "is that increasing @xmath17 makes the disorder potential more smooth and more shallow compared to the @xmath70 case",
    ". therefore the atoms are less localized in a correlated disorder potential .",
    "we have studied the one - dimensional fermi - hubbard model in a harmonic confinement potential and in the presence of correlated disorder .",
    "this is believed to represent cold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice created by standing laser waves .",
    "our numerical calculations of the site occupations are based on a lattice version of density functional theory in which we make use of the exact solution of the one - dimensional hubbard model to treat the exchange - correlation effects .",
    "disorder affects the ground - state phases of the interacting fermi gases confined in a harmonic potential and an optical lattice .",
    "the insulating regions appear to be stable against both uncorrelated and correlated disorder .",
    "the anomalous enhancement of the stiffness observed at low density for uncorrelated disorder decreases with increasing correlation length .",
