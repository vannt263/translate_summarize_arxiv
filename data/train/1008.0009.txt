    "the understanding of the evolution of early - type galaxies ( i.e. e and s0 galaxies ) has been greatly enhanced by the study of their interstellar medium ( ism ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this component , and its relevance in early - type galaxies ( etgs hereafter ) was widely neglected in early studies , since these galaxies were , for a long time , considered to be essentially devoided of interstellar gas and dust . in the last two decades , however , multi - wavelength observations have changed this picture and have detected the presence of a multi - phase ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the bulk of the gas in ellipticals is heated to the virial temperature , emitting in x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some etgs also contain large dust masses , which is surprising given the efficiency of sputtering by their hot plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even more surprising was the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in etg spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because , dust molecules as small as pahs , are expected to be more easily destroyed by the interaction with the hot plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "pah emission is a typical feature of the mid - infrared ( mir hereafter ) spectra of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are dominated by the strong 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath1 m emission bands usually attributed to the c ",
    "c stretching and c  h in - plane bending modes of ionized pahs ( see tielens 2008 and references therein )",
    ". however , the pah spectra of etgs are often different from those of star forming galaxies .",
    "the most striking characteristic is the unusual pah inter ",
    "band emission ratio between the 7.7 @xmath1 m complex and the 11.3 @xmath1 m complex @xcite .",
    "so , while in star forming galaxies the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath1 m features dominate the pah spectrum , they are very weak in these etgs , in spite of a strong 11.3 @xmath1 m band .",
    "there already exist studies in the literature aimed at understanding the nature and origin of these pah emission features , as well as the physical conditions of the ism , that allow the survival of this material in the observed ratios . @xcite",
    "analyzing the sings galaxies sample , found that some liners also have unusual pah ratios .",
    "they suggest that these ratios could be due to the relatively hard radiation field from a low - luminosity agn , which modifies the emitting grain distribution at the expense of the smaller pahs .",
    "@xcite claim that , once the continuum of the underlying stellar population , which has a broad dip just below the 7.7@xmath1 m complex , is properly subtracted , the low 7.7 to 11.3 @xmath1 m ratio turns into a value typical of the ism of late - type galaxies . in contrast , @xcite have shown cases where these ratios remain anomalous even after the proper removal of the underlying stellar population .",
    "these authors conclude that the anomalous ratios are likely due to the presence of a larger fraction of neutral pahs with respect to ionized pahs , contrary to what happens in the ism of late type galaxies .",
    "they ascribe this anomalous mixture to recent accretion events .    in this paper",
    "we deepen the investigation of this problem by presenting a new approach to the study of these peculiar etgs .",
    "we analyze our , high s / n _ spitzer_irs observations of four etgs ( see table [ tableape ] for the galaxy classification ) in low density environments ( ldes ) , namely ngc  1297 , ngc  5044 , ngc  6868 , and ngc  7079 , which display  unusual \" pah emission in their mir spectra . for our study",
    "we make use of theoretical spectra and empirical dust feature templates recently reported in the literature ( see e.g. rapacioli et al .",

    "2008 , joblin et al .",
    "2009 , bern et al .",
    "this method has the advantage of isolating the components responsible for the emission , thus providing more insight into the origin and evolution of this ism component @xcite .",
    "we advance a new scenario , where this pah emission is naturally explained in terms of the presence of an underlying intermediate age population of carbon stars , which are continuously feeding the ism with pristine carbonaceous material .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , the anomalous pah spectra are strong evidence of a rejuvenation episode that affected the evolution of the etgs in the recent past .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we provide the details of the observations and data reduction methods . in ",
