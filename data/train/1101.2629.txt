    "transient energy growth has been recognized as a possible mechanism explaining subcritical transition in wall - bounded flows ; in fact , subcritical flows may experience large transient amplifications of the energy of perturbations , that could trigger nonlinear mechanisms and eventually lead to transition to turbulence@xcite .    in viscous shear flows ,",
    "transient energy growth is related to the non - normality of the linearized navier - stokes operator with respect to the energy inner product@xcite . in the last few years",
    ", several investigators attempted to reduce the transient growth phenomenon in poiseuille and boundary layer flows by employing wall actuation and applying linear control theory to an appropriate discretization of the linearized equations . in their seminal work on feedback control of instabilities in two - dimensional poiseuille flow , joshi et al.@xcite employed a compensator in the form of a constant - gain integral feedback , and demonstrated stabilization of the linearly unstable flow as well as attenuation of finite amplitude disturbances .",
    "they further pointed out that transient amplifications in the flow energy may not be properly detected by the sensors , and also that the control itself may trigger nonlinear mechanisms by introducing transient disturbances on short times . leveraging a state - space formulation obtained after discretization of the boundary - controlled orr - sommerfeld - squire equations ,",
    "optimal and robust control theory was applied to transitional channel flows by bewley & liu@xcite for a single wavenumber pair and by hgberg et al.@xcite for a large array of wavenumber pairs , leading to a reduction of the maximum transient energy growth as well as an increase in transition thresholds .",
    "it has been recently shown@xcite that the linear coupling term in the orr - sommerfeld - squire equations plays a role not only in the non - normal behavior of the small perturbation dynamics , but also in the self - sustaining process of near - wall , low reynolds number turbulence .",
    "this evidence led investigators to test in turbulent channel flows the optimal controllers designed on linearized flow models , and encouraging results have been obtained in terms of drag reduction@xcite .",
    "feedback control of non - modal disturbances in boundary layer flows has been recently considered by corbett & bottaro@xcite in the framework of optimal control theory , while zuccher et al.@xcite applied steady suction in the attenuation of the growth of given optimal disturbances in a blasius boundary layer .",
    "although it has been demonstrated@xcite that optimal and robust control laws are well suited for reducing the non - normal behavior of fluid flow systems , to date no feedback control law has been devised with the capability of ensuring closed - loop monotonic stability , when boundary actuation is employed .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether such performance can be obtained with a linear feedback , and further which control techniques are available to directly target the transient growth mechanism . in the controls literature ,",
    "the transient amplification of certain norms of the state bears the name of _ peaking phenomenon _ and the monotonic stability requirement is generally referred to as _ strict dissipativity_. active controllers with the capability of targeting transient norm amplifications have received attention in the analysis of a class of partially linear cascade systems@xcite , and more recently in conjunction with a linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) approach@xcite . in a very recent paper , whidborne & mckernan@xcite extended these results giving conditions on the existence of a feedback controller ensuring the strict dissipativity of the closed - loop system .",
    "these results were then exploited by whidborne et .",
    "al@xcite , who considered the feedback control of a single wavenumber pair in plane poiseuille flow via lmi design and wall - normal blowing and suction , and by martinelli et al.@xcite , where lmi - based feedback controllers have been designed and tested for an array of wavenumber pairs .",
    "the present paper aims at expanding and completing these recent results , by showing first that it is impossible to design a linear state - feedback controller ensuring the plane poiseuille flow  controlled via wall transpiration with any velocity component  to be strictly dissipative . in a second step ,",
    "feedback control laws are designed using an lmi technique , for an array of wavenumber pairs ; their performance is compared against that of optimal controllers in the linear case , and furthermore closed - loop transition thresholds are evaluated for optimal initial conditions in the form of a pair of oblique waves and antisymmetric streamwise vortices , at the reynolds number @xmath0 , using different velocity components as wall actuators .",
    "we consider the dynamics of three - dimensional small perturbations to the laminar poiseuille solution in a plane channel .",
    "a cartesian coordinate system is introduced , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the streamwise , wall - normal and spanwise directions , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote the corresponding perturbation velocity components .",
    "the navier - stokes equations , linearized about the laminar solution @xmath7 , are non - dimensionalized with the centerline velocity @xmath8 and the channel half - width @xmath9 , and rewritten in the form of a single equation for @xmath5 one - way coupled to an equation for the wall - normal vorticity @xmath10 . fourier transformation in @xmath1 and @xmath3 direction yields the well known orr - sommerfeld - squire form : @xmath11 \\tilde{v } \\\\",

    "u + \\delta / re ] \\tilde{\\eta } \\end{split } \\label{eq : oss}\\ ] ] at the wavenumber pair @xmath12 . here",
    ", the tilde denotes fourier coefficients , the dot denotes time derivative , the prime denotes @xmath2 differentiation , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we select boundary conditions representing time - varying wall transpiration on any of the velocity components at the two channel walls ( `` vectorized transpiration '' ) . in turn , this results in inhomogeneous dirichlet and neumann conditions on @xmath17 , as well as inhomogeneous dirichlet conditions on @xmath18 : @xmath19 a standard lifting procedure@xcite is then employed , i.e. the unknowns are rewritten as homogeneous components ( satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions ) plus inhomogeneous components thus : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are polynomials in @xmath2 chosen to satisfy unitary boundary conditions for each lifted component appropriately .",
    "we discretise the homogeneous components @xmath22 and @xmath23 in wall - normal direction using a modified chebyshev series cardinal function basis @xmath24 where the modified chebyshev functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 implicitly enforce the required homogeneous dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , lead to good conditioning of the discrete laplacian operator , and no spurious modes are generated @xcite .",
    "the orr - sommerfeld - squire equations are then evaluated on a set of gauss - lobatto collocation points in @xmath2 direction and rearranged to have the time rate of change of actuation velocity as an input@xcite .",
    "this results in the the linear time - invariant system model@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are constant system and input matrices , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are respective input and state vectors . as noted in previous work@xcite , the natural outcome of this procedure is an augmented state - space form , where additional integrators associated to the values of the input velocity components at the walls are explicitly introduced .",
    "consequently , the _ open - loop _ dynamics of the system above ( i.e. setting @xmath32 ) is different from the dynamics of the original , _ unactuated _ system ( where the velocity at the walls is fixed by the no - slip condition ) .",
    "this terminology will be used throughout the paper to distinguish between the two cases .",
    "the kinetic energy per unit mass of flow perturbations in the volume @xmath33 @xmath34 can be expressed as a function of the state vector @xmath31 using the continuity equation , the definition of @xmath35 , and parseval s identity : @xmath36 where the matrix @xmath37 is an hermitian , positive definite matrix ; here , the superscript @xmath38 denotes conjugate transpose . in the following ,",
    "we have transformed the state vector via the change of variable @xmath39 ( @xmath40 being the cholesky factor of @xmath41 ) in order to rewrite the system dynamics as @xmath42 such that the system energy is directly given by the euclidean norm @xmath43@xcite .",
    "we consider the linear time - invariant system model ( [ eq : ltiabc ] ) and further assume that @xmath44 , that is @xmath45 has full column rank ( i.e. all the actuators are independent  a condition which is trivially satisfied in the present problem ) .",
    "contraction analysis for this kind of system has been presented by whidborne & mckernan@xcite and , in the general case of nonlinear systems , by lohmiller & slotine@xcite . in particular , referring to the linear case , it has been shown@xcite that there exists a static state - feedback controller @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a constant matrix , such that the closed - loop system has strict dissipativity ( i.e.  energy @xmath43 decays monotonically from all initial conditions @xmath48 ) , if and only if @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the left null space of @xmath45 .",
    "additionally@xcite if no static controller that achieves strict dissipativity exists , then no dynamic state - feedback controller , where @xmath30 is given from @xmath51 by the dynamic system @xmath52 where @xmath53,@xmath54 and @xmath55 are constant matrices and @xmath56 are controller states , exists either .",
    "it is immediate to verify that the second criterion in is never satisfied in the present system , as the hermitian matrix @xmath57 is never positive definite but it is always positive semidefinite , because the dimension of the input vector is always smaller than that of the state vector . in order to have @xmath58 ,",
    "a number of independent actuators equal to the number of flow states is required ; this is a situation that is unlikely to occur in practical flow control problems , where normally actuators are placed at the walls .",
    "even when volume forcing is available , this condition is unlikely to be satisfied , since practical volume forces are not as flexible as to enforce an arbitrary force distribution in the entire flow domain at any time instant .    the first algebraic criterion in eq .",
    "is equivalent to requiring that the portion of the system dynamics which is not accessible by the controls must be dissipative . verifying this criterion is not trivial .",
    "here we evaluate it numerically , in order to identify those regions in the @xmath59 parametric space where subcritical poiseuille flow may be rendered monotonically stable by feedback transpiration . to this aim ,",
    "the state - space model is first obtained on a fine grid and , as suggested by reddy & henningson@xcite , a limited number @xmath60 of eigenfunctions is retained , discarding those corresponding to highly damped and poorly resolved eigenvalues . properly rescaling the variables such that energy is written as an euclidean norm leads to a reduced order model @xmath61,@xmath62 , and the negative - definiteness of the corresponding matrix @xmath63 in is verified by computing its maximum ( real ) eigenvalue @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ fig : alfa_re ] shows the present result on the @xmath65 plane for @xmath66 , along with the well - known result on the transient growth dependence in plane poiseuille flow@xcite ( i.e. the unactuated case ) .",
    "the white area corresponds to the domain where the unactuated system is monotonically stable , while the shaded area is the region where the unactuated system admits transient energy growth .",
    "solid lines correspond to isocontours of @xmath64 , and it appears that the contour @xmath67 lies on the very boundary between the shaded and white area , implying that the hermitian matrix @xmath63 is indefinite when the unactuated system is not monotonically stable . an analogous result is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfa_beta_re ] , where isocontours of @xmath64 are reported on the plane @xmath12 , at @xmath68 ; again , the contour @xmath67 lies on the boundary between the regions of monotonic and non - monotonic stability . from the aforestated theorem@xcite",
    ", this implies that it is not possible to design a state - feedback controller that ensures the closed loop poiseuille flow to be monotonically stable , when the corresponding unactuated flow is not .",
    "this result shows an inherent limitation in the feedback control of the transient growth mechanism , when vectorized wall transpiration in terms of time rate of change of zero net - mass flux blowing / suction is employed .",
    "note that vectorized transpiration , although being rather idealized , exploits all the degrees of freedom available for boundary control in the present problem ; therefore , the present result is representative of a limiting situation . in a practical",
    "setting , actuator - dependent constraints may introduce additional mechanisms restricting the control authority even more .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that strict dissipativity is a rather tough requirement for a controller bound to operate on a largely underactuated flow , and in fact an approach based on strict dissipativity is in general quite conservative , i.e. some energy growth is tolerable in transition control .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that the present analysis is limited to linear feedback laws , and that performance of nonlinear controllers may be more promising .",
    "for example , it has been shown@xcite that introducing a nonlinearity in the form of gain - scheduling on full - state feedback laws led to relaminarization of low-@xmath69 turbulence even employing wall actuation only , and that adjoint - based optimization on the nonlinear turbulent flow can be successfully employed in feedback relaminarization @xcite .",
    "in order to design a state - feedback controller with the capability of targeting the transient growth mechanism directly , an estimate of the maximum transient growth is required .",
    "such estimate is obtained as an upper bound on the maximum growth via lyapunov theory . for the linear , time invariant , asymptotically stable system : @xmath70 it can be shown that an upper bound on the maximum transient growth @xmath71 is given by @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 satysfies the lyapunov inequality @xmath74 a minimal upper bound can be obtained by solving the following minimization problem @xcite : @xmath75 where the last inequality ensures @xmath76 . the problem stated in eq .",
    "is a lmi generalized eigenvalue problem , and standard solution methods based on interior point algorithms are available@xcite .",
    "an analogous problem to that stated in eq . can be obtained if the feedback minimization of the upper bound is of interest .",
    "indeed , let us consider the system along with a state - feedback control law in the form @xmath77 , so that in closed - loop the system dynamics is described by : @xmath78 leveraging the additional degrees of freedom due to the controller gains @xmath79 , we move to minimizing the closed - loop upper bound on the maximum transient growth .",
    "the associated lyapunov inequality now reads : @xmath80 this inequality can be rewritten in the lmi form by recalling that a similarity transformation preserves the eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , defining @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the closed - loop upper - bound minimization problem can be written as @xcite @xmath83 where the last , additional inequality ensures a limit in the control effort in the form @xmath84 .",
    "the problem has to be solved for @xmath37 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; controller gains are obtained from @xmath87 .",
    "this problem is again a lmi generalized eigenvalue problem , that can be solved using standard methods @xcite .",
    "lmi controllers are designed wavenumber - wise , using the model of the system and the design equations . in particular",
    ", we consider each actuation component ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 on both walls ) independently ; a limit on the control effort @xmath88 , kept constant in wavenumber space , is used in the design of all controllers . in the design procedure",
    ", the linear equations pertaining to each wavenumber pair are discretized using @xmath89 chebyshev polynomials , and modal truncation at @xmath90 ( the maximum affordable size of the computational problem ) is performed prior to the actual solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "in addition to removing poorly resolved dynamics , modal truncation proved to be necessary due to the exacting memory requirements of the existing lmi solvers ( scaling as @xmath91 ) ; in performing modal truncation , it was thoroughly verified that the reduced order model preserves the linear transient energy growth of the unactuated system .",
    "the performance of lmi controllers is evaluated first in the linear setting at @xmath0 ; in particular , perturbations at two representative wavenumber pairs are considered , namely , an oblique wave @xmath92 and a streamwise vortex @xmath93 . in the results reported here",
    ", the effectiveness of different actuation components is also addressed .    the analysis reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : monotonic ] shows that the closed - loop system will have a non - normal behavior ; it is therefore natural to contrast the maximum closed - loop transient growth @xmath71 with the open - loop one , in order to verify that a consistent reduction in @xmath71 is obtained via the minimization in .",
    "results , obtained for the same truncated system used in the design and for the two wavenumber pairs considered , are reported in table [ tab : contrastg ] .",
    "it is shown that , in both the oblique wave case and the streamwise vortex case , solution of leads to a closed - loop system experiencing a reduced maximum transient energy growth . in particular , for the oblique wave case , @xmath5 is the most effective actuation component , whereas actuating with @xmath6 is most effective in the streamwise vortex case .",
    ".maximum transient energy growth @xmath71 for the open - loop and closed - loop cases , for the oblique wave case ( @xmath94,@xmath95 ) and the streamwise vortex case ( @xmath96,@xmath97 ) , using different actuation components on both walls .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     results reported in table [ tab : thresholds ] for the thresholds obtained using @xmath5 actuation are in qualitative agreement with previous work using the lqr controllers@xcite ; however , in quantitative terms the lqr approach outperforms the present lmi approach .",
    "in particular , the improvement factors reported with lqr for oblique waves and streamwise vortices at @xmath0 are @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively@xcite ; therefore , lqr controllers seem to perform substantially better than lmi controllers in presence of oblique waves as initial conditions",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that such comparison is not entirely appropriate .",
    "in fact , even if the same energy norm is used to quantify the magnitude of velocity disturbances , control laws are designed with different parameters constraining the control effort . as a matter of fact , the linear results reported in fig . [",
    "fig : lin - ow ] and [ fig : lin - sv ] show that the lmi controller performs similarly to the lqr controller for a value of the lqr control weight @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "these values are different from the value of @xmath102 , used uniformly in wavenumber space in hgberg et al.@xcite .",
    "a fair comparison between the two approaches is not possible in this case ; therefore , it is impossible to draw a conclusive statement about the effectiveness of feedback minimization of transient growth versus feedback minimization of the disturbance energy in transition delay .",
    "as the ultimate goal of lmi controllers is that of preventing transition to turbulence , it can be important to quantify the energy efficiency of these controllers in the nonlinear case .",
    "for instance , given a transitional initial condition , it is possible to compare the energy expenditure of the controller to prevent transition with the additional energy to be introduced into the unactuated flow to compensate for the increase in friction , over the same time window ( i.e. the time necessary for the transient in the controlled flow to die out ) . referring to the best performing cases in table [ tab : thresholds ] ,",
    "we consider actuation with wall - normal velocity @xmath5 and , in the two cases , initial conditions having energy @xmath103 below the corresponding closed - loop threshold .",
    "using the present nondimensionalization , a conservative estimate of the energy required for the control action in the time interval @xmath104 $ ] can be given by@xcite : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the fluctuating wall pressure and @xmath107 the upper and lower blowing / suction surfaces , whereas the additional energy required to drive the unactuated flow against the increased viscous drag on the same time interval is given by : @xmath108 the ratio @xmath109 reads about @xmath110 and @xmath111 , for the oblique waves and streamwise vortex case , respectively .",
    "furthermore , linear tests using @xmath5 actuation have shown that @xmath112 can be of the same order of magnitude of the actual reduction in maximum transient energy growth .",
    "hence , these results indicate that , even if the energy expenditure due to the control action is comparable to that experienced in the linear amplification of the optimal disturbance , it is nevertheless negligible if compared to the potential energy saving due to transition prevention .",
    "the present work has considered the design of full - state feedback controllers specifically targeting the transient energy growth mechanism in laminar channel flow .",
    "it has been shown that full transpiration at both walls and full - state knowledge are not sufficient to ensure a monotonically stable closed - loop system via a linear feedback law .",
    "further , an advanced control design technique  based on a lmi formulation  has been employed to design feedback controllers that have been tested in both the linearized setting and in nonlinear , transitional flows .",
    "linear tests indicated that the lmi strategy allows to obtain a consistent reduction of the maximum open - loop transient growth . at a given global control expenditure over a time window",
    "sufficiently long for the perturbations to decay to zero , the lmi - controlled closed - loop system experiences a lower transient energy amplification than a lqr - controlled closed - loop flow .",
    "however , in presence of an optimal perturbation for the unactuated flow , the performance of the two control strategies is practically equivalent .",
    "results obtained in the linear setting further indicate that , in the case of perturbations in the form of oblique waves and streamwise vortices , the most effective actuation components are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .    in the nonlinear case",
    ", it has been found that these controllers are capable of increasing the threshold energy for transition when initial conditions are given to the flow in the form of oblique waves or streamwise vortices ; the effectiveness of different actuation components has been addressed , indicating that wall blowing / suction is most effective in providing a higher closed - loop threshold energy . additionally , in transitional conditions , lmi controllers prove to be energy - effective , as the energy required by the control action is negligible when compared to the energy saving due to avoiding transition .",
