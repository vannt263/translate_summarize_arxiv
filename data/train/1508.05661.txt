    "ever since the advent of the local metropolis algorithm ( lmc ) @xcite , monte carlo simulations of systems with many degrees of freedom have played an important role in statistical physics . near phase transitions , lmc is severely hampered by dynamical arrest phenomena such as critical slowing down for second - order transitions , nucleation and coarsening at first - order transitions , and glassy behavior in disordered systems .",
    "a number of specialized algorithms then allow to speed up the sampling of configuration space , namely the swendsen ",
    "wang @xcite and the wolff @xcite cluster algorithms , the multicanonical method @xcite and the exchange monte carlo method @xcite based on extended ensembles .    the above algorithms respect detailed balance , a sufficient condition for the convergence towards the equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",
    "recently , algorithms breaking detailed balance but satisfying the necessary global - balance condition have been discussed @xcite . among them ,",
    "the event - chain monte carlo ( ecmc ) algorithm @xcite has proven useful in hard - sphere @xcite and more general particle systems @xcite , allowing to equilibrate larger systems than previously possible @xcite . it has also been applied to continuous spin systems @xcite . ecmc uses a factorized metropolis filter @xcite and relies on an additional `` lifting '' variable to augment configuration space @xcite .",
    "it is rejection - free and realizes an irreversible markov chain .",
    "so far , however , the speedup realized by ecmc with respect to lmc has always represented a constant factor in the thermodynamic limit , although larger gains are theoretically possible @xcite .    in this paper , we apply ecmc to the three - dimensional ferromagnetic heisenberg model , defined by the energy @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the unit of the energy , @xmath4 is a three - component unit vector and the sum runs over all neighboring pairs of the @xmath5 sites of a simple cubic lattice of linear extension @xmath6 . in our simulations , we consider the critical inverse temperature @xmath7 @xcite . to describe the dynamics of the system , we compute the autocorrelation functions of the energy , the system magnetization @xmath8 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 the energy and the susceptibility are both invariant under global rotations of the spins @xmath10 around a common axis , whereas the magnetization follows the rotation .",
    "we will argue that the energy and the susceptibility are slow variables , that is that their slowest time constant describes the correlation ( mixing ) time of the underlying markov chain . under this hypothesis",
    ", we will present evidence that the ecmc for the three - dimensional heisenberg model reduces the dynamical critical exponent from the lmc value of @xmath1 to @xmath11 .",
    "this considerable reduction of mixing times with respect to the lmc may well be optimal within the lifting approach @xcite .",
    "the observed reduction is all the more surprising as in the closely related @xmath12 model @xcite , where the spins are two - dimensional unit vectors , the ecmc realizes speedups by two orders of magnitude with respect to lmc , but does not seem to lower the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "applied to the heisenberg model , the ecmc augments the physical space of spin configurations by a lifting variable @xmath13 which specifies the considered infinitesimal counterclockwise rotation of spin @xmath14 about the axis @xmath15 . by virtue of the factorized metropolis filter",
    ", this physical move can only be rejected by a single neighboring spin , @xmath16 , and the lifting variable will then be moved as @xmath17 , keeping the sense of rotation , but passing it on to the spin responsible for the rejection . in the augmented space ,",
    "the rejections are thus supplanted by events , namely the lifting moves for arrested physical states .",
    "the ecmc , for a given axis @xmath15 , breaks detailed balance , yet satisfies global balance , as the probability flow into each lifted configuration equals the flow out of it , to first order in the time increment @xmath18 . for the @xmath12 model of planar rotators , @xmath15 is uniquely defined as the axis perpendicular to the sense of rotation . for this reason ,",
    "the ecmc around this axis is irreducible , and the chain length @xmath19 in this model is best taken equal to the simulation time @xcite . for the heisenberg model",
    ", spin rotations must be about at least two axes , in order to reach the entire configuration space .",
    "the resampling of the rotation axis is performed after the cumulative rotation angles about the previous axis reaches the chain length @xmath19 .",
    "all configurations of the chain sample the equilibrium distribution and any uniform subset of them yield valid observable averages .",
    "observables may be integrated during the continuous evolution or _",
    "e.g. _ retrieved at regular intervals independent of the lifting events .    for a fixed rotation axis @xmath15 , the ecmc algorithm for the heisenberg model reduces to the one of the @xmath12 model : with @xmath20 the spherical coordinates of a spin @xmath14 in a system where the @xmath21-axis is aligned with @xmath15 , the pair energy @xmath22 between spins",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath16 is @xmath23 both @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend only on the polar angles @xmath26 and remain unchanged along the event chain . the azimuthal - angle dependence in eq .",
    "( [ hxy_e ] ) is @xmath27 , as in the @xmath12 model .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath28 increases for each ecmc chain from its initial value @xmath29 until one of its neighbors , @xmath16 , triggers a lifting @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    "the latter is sampled with a single random number in the event - driven approach @xcite .",
    "precisely , @xmath32 is given by the sampling of the positive pair energy increase : @xmath33/ \\beta = \\\\ -j'\\int^{\\phi_{l , \\text{event}}}_{\\phi_0 }               \\max\\left(0 , \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\cos(\\phi_{{\\boldsymbol{v } } , k } -                \\phi_{{\\boldsymbol{v } } , l})}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{{\\boldsymbol{v } } , k } } \\right ) \\mathrm{d}\\phi_{{\\boldsymbol{v } } , k } , \\label{sampling_phi}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a uniform random number between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "to solve eq .",
    "( [ sampling_phi ] ) for @xmath32 , one first slices off any full rotations ( these @xmath37 rotations by @xmath38 yield an energy increase of @xmath39 ) , leaving a value @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 the true lifting event corresponds to the earliest of the independent event times sampled for all the neighbors of the spin @xmath14 . in ecmc ,",
    "monte carlo time is continuous and proportional to the total displacement of the spins .",
    "we have checked the correctness of the ecmc , and obtained perfect agreement for the mean energy , the specific heat and the susceptibility with the heat - bath algorithm @xcite modified with the exchange monte carlo method ( or `` parallel tempering '' ) @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : static ] ) .",
    "at the critical temperature for various system sizes . the inset shows the spin autocorrelation function of a trivial algorithm that only performs global rotations in spin space along the two axes . ]    at the critical temperature @xmath43 , the correlation length @xmath44 of a model undergoing a second - order phase transition equals the system size @xmath6 and the autocorrelation time of slow variables @xmath45 diverges as @xmath46 , where @xmath21 is the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "we measure time in sweeps : one ecmc sweep corresponds , in average , to @xmath47 lifting events and one lmc sweep to @xmath47 attempted moves .",
    "time autocorrelation functions are defined by    @xmath48    where the brackets @xmath49 indicate the thermal average and @xmath50 is set sufficiently large for equilibration .",
    "the dynamical critical exponent of lmc for the three - dimensional heisenberg model was estimated from the autocorrelation function of the magnetization @xmath51 as @xmath52@xcite .",
    "the over - relaxation algorithm @xcite seems to give @xmath53 @xcite which was obtained from the autocorrelation function of the magnetization , and the wolff algorithm is believed to yield a value close to zero : @xmath54 , a value obtained from the susceptibility autocorrelation function @xcite .    to evaluate the correlation time and the dynamical critical exponent for the ecmc , one must pay attention to the irreversible nature of the underlying markov chain . during one event chain ,",
    "spins all rotate in the same sense , and the system undergoes global rotations with taking into account the thermal fluctuation .",
    "this results in fast oscillations of the magnetization @xmath51 and a quick decay of its autocorrelation function that is insensitive to the system size ( see fig .  [ fig : autocorrelation ] ) , and even to the temperature .",
    "however , this effect is also visible for a trivial algorithm , which simply performs global rotations ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : autocorrelation ] ) .",
    "the trivial algorithm satisfies global balance , but its correlation time is infinite , as it does not relax the energy .",
    "a similar effect appears in the ecmc for particle systems @xcite , that likewise is not characterized by the mean net displacement of particles . to characterize the speed of the ecmc",
    ", we consider the energy density and the susceptibility that we conjecture to be slow variables at the critical temperature .",
    "both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are insensitive to global rotations and do not oscillate .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ec_aco ] , the autocorrelation functions both of the energy density and of the susceptibility are well approximated as a single exponential decay @xmath57 on essentially the same timescales .",
    "furthermore , the finite - size behavior of the autocorrelation times indicates @xmath11 dynamical scaling .",
    "this @xmath21 value is significantly less than for the lmc and very similar to the one obtained for over - relaxation methods , although the @xmath58 value of the cluster algorithm is not reached .",
    "the earliest application of lifting @xcite , the motion of a particle on a one - dimensional @xmath47-site lattice with periodic boundary conditions , already featured the decrease of the dynamical scaling exponent from @xmath59 to @xmath60 ( the reduction of the mixing time from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) . to reach such reductions",
    ", the markov chain must be irreversible .",
    "it was pointed out that the `` square - root '' decrease of the critical exponent was the optimal improvement  @xcite .",
    "the concepts of factorized metropolis filters and of infinitesimal moves bring irreversible lifting algorithms to general @xmath47-body systems , although only finite speed - ups were realized so far in the @xmath63 limit .",
    "the three - dimensional heisenberg model seems to be a first such ecmc application with a lowered critical dynamical exponent .",
    "our observation relies on the hypotheses that the energy and the susceptibility are indeed `` slow '' variables , and that the observed decay of the autocorrelation function continues for larger times .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ f : ec_aco ] , a crossover from @xmath60 back to @xmath59 as it was observed in the @xmath12-model after @xmath64 sweeps  @xcite appears unlikely to arise after hundreds of sweeps .",
    "the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 represents a maximal improvement with respect to the @xmath65 of lmc , supposing again that the theorems of ref .",
    "@xcite apply to infinitesimal markov chains .    in summary ,",
    "we have successfully applied ecmc to the heisenberg model in three dimensions .",
    "ecmc shows considerable promise for spin models , and the numerical data presented in this paper allow us to formulate the exciting conjecture that the dynamical critical exponent for the heisenberg model is @xmath66 .",
    "ecmc is also applicable to frustrated magnets and spin glasses , which involve antiferromagnetic interactions and/or quenched disorder .",
    "our preliminary study indicates that the ecmc algorithm is also useful for a heisenberg spin glass model .",
    "ecmc can be easily combined with other algorithms such as the exchange monte carlo method and the over - relaxation algorithm in the usual manner .",
    "this may allow to investigate the three - dimensional heisenberg spin glass model in the low - temperature region .",
    "large - scale simulations in this direction are currently in progress",
    ". it would be very interesting to understand why ecmc is so much more successful in the heisenberg model than both in hard and soft disks and in the @xmath12 model .",
