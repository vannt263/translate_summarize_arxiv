    "2 we observe that the width of these bragg peaks notoriously increases as @xmath40 augments . in particular , for @xmath93 mm , bragg interference is almost completely blurred out and intense rainbow maxima at the outermost azimuthal angles of the angular spectrum arise gravielle08 . for wider collimating apertures ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath94 mm , bragg peaks fade out , giving way to supernumerary rainbow structures in the final projectile distribution . as discussed in refs .",
    "winter15,gravielle15 , this behavior is associated with the transversal length @xmath95 of the area @xmath9 of the surface plane that is coherently illuminated by the incident beam .",

    "( [ ucoh ] ) as @xmath96 @xcite , being inversely proportional to @xmath40 , as given by eq .",

    "2 several reduced unit cells in the direction transversal to the incidence channel become coherently illuminated by the initial wave packet , giving rise to sharp bragg maxima .",
    "but when the width of the collimating opening augments , the number of reduced unit cells that are coherently lighted decreases , and for @xmath94 mm only one reduced unit cell is coherently illuminated along the @xmath41 direction .",
    "consequently , interferences coming from different parallel channels , which are associated with the bragg mechanism schuller09,schullergrav09 , disappear and the unit - cell form factor corresponding to the interference inside one channel governs the projectile distribution @xcite , causing supernumerary rainbow structures to be visible instead @xcite .",
    "such an effect of the width of the collimating aperture on fad  patterns was also experimentally observed @xcite . as shown in figs . 2 and 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , sivr diffraction spectra for two different collimating widths - @xmath97 mm and @xmath98 mm  - compare very well with the corresponding experimental data extracted from ref .",
    "for the narrowest aperture ( fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the experimental and theoretical distributions present well - defined bragg peaks laying on a thick annulus , whose mean radius is approximately equal to @xmath99",
    ". however , these interference structures completely vanish when the width of the opening increases , as it happens in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "gravielle15 , where only maxima at the rainbow deflection angles are clearly observed .    in the case of a single collimating slit",
    ", the thickness of the annulus corresponding to the @xmath100 distribution of scattered projectiles is controlled by the length of the collimating aperture , increasing as @xmath63 augments . in fig .",
    "3 we show angular projectile distributions derived from the sivr approach by considering single collimating slits with the same width - @xmath97 mm - and different lengths . for the small square aperture of fig .",
    "3 ( a ) , with @xmath101 mm , the bragg peaks look like circular spots lying on a thin ring whose radius is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "but the thickness of this ring augments as @xmath42 increases , and for @xmath102 mm ( fig .",
    "3 ( b ) ) the spots become slightly elongated strips . for longer collimating apertures , with @xmath103 mm , not only the length of the interference fringes",
    "augments but also the different bragg orders are situated at different radius , sampling additional interference structures along the @xmath104- axis .",
    "this effect is related to the @xmath69- spread of the initial wave packet , which is determined by @xmath105 , being proportional to @xmath42 as given by eqs .",
    "( [ sigmatita ] ) and ( [ sigmax ] ) .",
    "large @xmath42 values produce a wide spread of the impact momentum normal to the surface plane , @xmath106 , revealing interference structures similar to those observed in the diffraction charts for different normal energies @xmath107 .",
    "then , the intensity oscillations along the @xmath81- axis observed for long collimating openings are exploring the surface potential for different distances to the topmost atomic plane .      within the limits where eq .",
    "( [ ucoh ] ) holds , for double collimating slits the length of the coherently illuminated region along the incidence channel is governed by @xmath64 , instead of @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , under similar collimating conditions a double - slit collimating device produces a larger @xmath108- dispersion than the one corresponding to a single slit . since a wide @xmath69- spread leads to a large dispersion of the perpendicular momentum @xmath109 , the angular projectile distributions derived by using a double aperture with a separation @xmath50 of a few millimeters display interference structures in the final polar angle axis , as observed in fig .",
    "4 . at the point that @xmath110  @xmath111 mm",
    ", the corresponding angular distribution resembles the usual diffraction chart , which is obtained with a single - slit collimator by varying the incidence angle @xmath99 , or what is the same , the normal energy @xmath112 , to cover the whole perpendicular energy spectrum . in fig .",
    "5 we compare the sivr angular spectrum derived by using a double - slit collimating device with @xmath110  @xmath111 mm with the diffraction chart obtained from the sivr approach with a single slit , both collimating apertures with the same size : @xmath113 mm . the similarities between the projectile distributions of figs . 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ) are evident , reinforcing the idea that double collimating slits might be employed to probe potential energy surfaces corresponding to different normal energies , instead of the commonly used diffraction charts .",
    "similar angular distributions can be also obtained by employing a single slit with a sufficiently large @xmath42 height .",
    "lastly , notice that any change in the present collimation setups might affect our results and it should be specifically investigated by using a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ nu-0 ] ) .",
    "moreover ,  we have considered fixed incidence conditions , i.e. , constant de broglie wavelengths . however , the spatial spread of the initial wave packet depends on @xmath52 and @xmath114 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ sigmax ] ) .",
    "then , a variation of the incidence energy or angle would modify such a spread , affecting the shape of the diffraction patterns .",
    "also , the presence of crystal defects might play a role contributing to additional angular dispersions .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the collimation of the incident beam on fad patterns by considering a single- and  a double- slit collimator that limits the effective size of an extended incoherent atom source .",
    "projectile distributions originated by elastic scattering were derived from the sivrapproximation @xcite by incorporating a realistic description of the coherent initial wave packet in terms of the collimating parameters .",
    "the profile of the initial wave packet was derived from a model based on the van cittert - zernike theorem , which relates the effective size of the beam source with the complex degree of coherence .",
    "the theory was applied to helium atoms grazingly impinging on a lif(001 ) surface , considering a  fixed incidence condition and different sizes of the rectangular collimating apertures .    in this work we found that the collimating effects on the final polar and azimuthal distributions are decoupled .",
    "while the @xmath82distribution is affected by the transversal width of the collimating slit , the @xmath81 distribution is governed by the geometrical characteristics of the collimating device along @xmath115 . for a single - slit collimator ,",
    "the sivr interference patterns are strongly affected by the width of the collimating aperture , which makes bragg peaks ( supernumerary rainbows ) visible for narrow  ( wide ) apertures . in turn",
    ", the length of the collimating opening affects the polar angle distribution of scattered projectiles , making visible additional intensity oscillations in the @xmath87- axis for long collimating apertures .",
    "this effect is related to the dispersion of the normal momentum @xmath109 and it is more evident for a double - slit collimator .    in the case of a double - slit collimating device",
    ", the interference patterns along the final polar angle axis are governed by the separation between slits . by using separation distances between slits of  several millimeters",
    "it would be possible to obtain projectile distributions covering a wide range of final polar angles .",
    "such distributions might be used to probe the projectile - surface interaction for different normal distances . finally , it should be stressed that actual experimental setups can involve different collimating stages , whose full description is necessary in order to obtain a proper representation of the collimating effects .",
