    "in addition , small uncertainties in background subtraction , or a contribution from the snr could cause such an effect , and so we prefer to set a limit of @xmath40 to any phase - dependent change in @xmath4 .      in order to accumulate the spectrum of the snr shell a complex shaped extraction region consisting of a circle , delimited by two straight lines with the pulsar and jet - like x - ray lobe cut out",

    "the effective area of the lecs depends on source position within the fov and the appropriate response matrix was determined by using 11 point sources whose position and relative intensities were chosen to mimic the observed count distribution .",
    "examination of the extracted spectrum shows that the snr is only detected between 0.254.5  kev and data outside this range are excluded .",
    "the spectrum of the snr shell was fit with the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma emission model ( plus absorption ) implemented in v.  1.10 of the spex package .",

    "the accretion flow has two components . a low - angular momentum component giving rise to the blackbody emission from a large fraction of the neutron star surface , and a high - angular momentum one forming an accretion disk responsible for the power - law emission .",

    "the lecs spectra of the snr shell and of the jet - like x - ray lobe are indistinguishable , supporting a common origin for these two regions .",
    "we therefore refer to the summed spectrum as `` the snr '' . for an assumed distance of 4  kpc",
    ", the 15  radius of the snr shell corresponds to 17.5pc , or an emitting volume of @xmath52@xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the filling factor of the emitting plasma within a sphere .",
    "the mass of the snr is then @xmath55  m@xmath3 .",
    "the canonical filling factor for a strong shock is 0.25 , although the absence of half of the remnant reduces this by a factor of 2 .",
    "the clumpiness of the x - ray emission ( with most of the emission coming from a few bright spots ) implies an even smaller filling factor , and we adopt a value of 0.1 .",
    "the total emitting remnant mass is therefore @xmath11520  m@xmath3 .",
    "the remnant age is estimated to be 13,000  yr using the hydrodynamical model of wang et al .",
    "however this estimate uses a remnant plasma temperature of 0.4kev , significantly lower than determined here .",
    "the higher temperature implies a faster expansion speed ( 900kms@xmath6 rather than 590kms@xmath6 ) , and thus that the remnant is younger than previously estimated .",

    "given their analytical approach , is possible to scale their estimated age to the current temperature determination to give a value of 3000  yr .",
    "the low value derived for the emitting mass is consistent with a young remnant , which has not yet swept up large quantities of circumstellar material .",
    "the abundances derived from the x - ray spectrum are slightly higher than cosmic values , indicative of circumstellar material which has been mildly enriched either by the stellar wind of the progenitor in its late evolutionary stages , or by some moderate mixing - in of ejecta material .",
    "the value of the ionization parameter ( @xmath56@xmath45yr ) is indicative of strong non - equilibrium conditions , with an implied ionization age of 3000yr , in good agreement with the scaled numerical simulations of hughes et al .",
    "the lack of strongly enriched material implies that the ejecta is not being directly observed , and is also consistent with the lack of a strong wind of enriched gas originating from the progenitor in its late stages .",
    "this is suggestive of a low - mass progenitor and a type  ib supernova .",
    "the lecs fit results to the whole of the snr are similar to those of rho & petre ( 1997 ) , who analyzed bbxrt and _ rosat _  spectra of a small part of the remnant , just south of the pulsar .",
    "their fit with a nei model in non - equipartition also shows strong non - equilibrium conditions , with a comparable ( considered the differences in the instrumental responses and plasma emission models ) age of 6700  yr , near - cosmic or slightly enriched abundances and an emitting mass of @xmath57  m@xmath3 .",
