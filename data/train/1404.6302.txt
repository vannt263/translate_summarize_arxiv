    "the motion of permeable particles in a fluid has long received considerable attention in many fields such as colloid science , chemical , biomedical and environmental engineering . because the fluid can penetrate into a permeable particle",
    ", there is a flow relative to the rigid skeleton of the porous medium . the hydrodynamic fields outside and inside the particles need to be treated together , which differs much from those of solid impermeable particles @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have been devoted to the understanding of transport phenomena in moving porous media for applications , such as sedimentation , agglomeration , flotation and filtration .    in order to obtain the fluid velocity within a permeable particle , conservation equations which accurately govern the fluid flows are required for the permeable region @xcite . under creeping flow conditions and considering the resistance force from the solid surface of moving porous media , two models for the fluid motion within porous media",
    "are commonly employed in the literature , i.e. , darcy s law and the brinkman equation .",
    "using the stokes equation and darcy s law , payatakes and dassios @xcite investigated the motion of a porous sphere toward a solid planar wall .",
    "later , burganos et al .",
    "@xcite provided a revision to their work with respect to the drag force exerted on the permeable particle . owing to the negligence of the viscous dissipation term ,",
    "the momentum equation for the interior fluid of the porous media involves only first - order spatial derivatives in darcy s law , while the momentum equation for the outside fluid includes spatial derivatives up to the second - order .",
    "this brings out a general fact that darcy s law is confined to the case that the permeability of the porous media is sufficiently low .",
    "meanwhile , the continuity in both the fluid velocity and the stress at the interface between the permeable medium and the exterior fluid are not guaranteed @xcite .",
    "complementary boundary treatment is hence needed to satisfy the continuity at the interface of a moving porous medium @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the brinkman equation , the velocity - gradient term corresponding to viscous dissipation of the fluid within the porous medium is incorporated in the momentum equation , and the continuity of the fluid velocity is fulfilled at the surface of the porous body . from this point of view , the brinkman equation is more suitable than darcy s law in the porous particulate systems .",
    "based on the brinkman equation , numerous theoretical and computational studies have been conducted concerning moving permeable particles . for example , jones @xcite calculated the forces and torques on moving porous particles with a method of reflection , and some studies were also carried out to investigate the suspension flow of porous particles using the brinkman equation with other accompanying methods @xcite . recently ,",
    "the brinkman model was also employed to study the hydrodynamic motion and interactions of composite particles .    in all of the aforementioned studies ,",
    "the flow inside a moving permeable particle is described using either darcy s law or the brinkman model . in these two models ,",
    "the transient term and the nonlinear inertial term are not included in the momentum equation .",
    "it follows that there is no mechanism to treat the unsteady evolution of flow fields , and the flow reynolds number for fluid flows must be kept sufficiently small .",
    "however , as noted by wood @xcite , the inertial effect on the flow and transport in porous media should be considered in many practical applications . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no theoretical and numerical works have been developed to address this limitation . a new model is therefore desired for moving porous particulate systems at finite flow reynolds numbers .    on the other hand , due to the complexity of internal geometries and interfacial structures ,",
    "it is impractical to solve the microscopic conservation equations inside the pores . a preferable approach is to average the microscopic equations inside porous particles over a representative elementary volume ( rev ) , the size of which is assumed to be much larger than the characteristic size of pore structures but much smaller than the domain .",
    "evidence from the literature indicates that a set of macroscopic equations at this scale can be derived through a rigorous volume - averaging procedure @xcite , such as the solidification process of multicomponent mixtures , the flow through the interdendritic mushy zone @xcite , the non - newtonian fluid flows in porous media @xcite , and the flow in a stationary porous medium .",
    "however , it appears that a general form of the volume - averaged or macroscopic momentum equation , where the transient as well as the nonlinear inertial terms are included , has not yet been developed for a moving porous medium .",
    "the foregoing review of the literature has prompted us to derive more general governing equations for a moving porous medium , using the volume - averaging procedure .",
    "this is the main objective of the present work .",
    "meanwhile , in addition to the phase average velocity commonly used for porous flows , the intrinsic phase average velocity is also employed in the literature @xcite . for example , yang et al .",
    "@xcite recently used the intrinsic phase average form of the flow velocity in the macroscopic equations , while adopted the phase average form in the flow resistance term .",
    "similar disparity in the fluid velocity is also found in the momentum equation used by smit et al .",
    "@xcite . in general , it is still not clear which kind of volume - averaged velocity should be used , especially for the case of moving porous media considered here . to our knowledge , no studies focused on this issue have been reported till now .",
    "this indicates the need for investigating the correct choice of superficial velocity from several possible volume - averaged velocities , which is another objective of this work .    in the following ,",
    "the averaging theorems regarding the time derivatives and spatial derivatives are first presented .",
    "the macroscopic equations for the incompressible flow in a moving porous medium are then derived . to solve the derived macroscopic equations , a lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) method",
    "is employed , and numerical simulations in two frames of reference are carried out to investigate what kind of volume - averaged fluid velocity should be chosen .",
    "the results show that galilean invariance of the macroscopic equations can be obtained only with the intrinsic phase averaged velocity , while the use of the phase averaged velocity will break the galilean invariance .",
    "in this work , the macroscopic governing equations for the fluid flow in a moving permeable body will be derived rigorously by averaging the microscopic continuity and momentum equations over a rev . to this end",
    ", the averaging theorems are needed to relate the average of the derivative to the derivative of the average . as shown in the literature @xcite",
    ", a number of authors developed these theorems forming the basis of the volume - averaging method . in this section",
    ", we will briefly review the invoked averaging theorems for subsequent derivations .    the flow in a moving porous medium is composed of fluid and solid phases .",
    "assume that the fluid phase occupies a volume of @xmath0 in a representative volume @xmath1 within the porous medium .",
    "the volume occupied by the solid phase is hence @xmath2 . in the study of multiphase transport process in porous media",
    ", it is important to distinguish three versions of volume averaged quantities @xcite .",
    "the first of these is the _ intrinsic phase average _ defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the volume of the @xmath5-phase within the representative volume @xmath1 , @xmath6 is a quantity associated with the @xmath5-phase , and @xmath7 with ` f ' and ` s ' respectively denoting the fluid and solid phases .",
    "the second is the _ phase average _ which is the most commonly encountered averaged quantity @xcite @xmath8 with the two definitions , one can obtain the following relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the local volume fraction of the @xmath5-phase . the third average is the _ spatial average _ of a quantity @xmath11 given by @xmath12 which assume @xmath11 can be defined in both phases and the average is taken over the fluid and solid phases . as noted by whitaker @xcite , the spatial average appears as an unimportant variable especially in the volume - averaged equations .",
    "thus , our discussions on the superficial velocity will focus on the other two averages as defined above and consistently in this paper .",
    "the macroscopic conservation equations are obtained by averaging the microscopic equations over a representative volume , and the following averaging theorems @xcite provide the basis to derive the macroscopic equations :    [ theo : average ] @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the interfacial area between the two phases within the averaging volume @xmath1 , @xmath17 represents the velocity of the interface @xmath16 , @xmath18 denotes the unit outwardly directed normal vector for the @xmath5-phase , and @xmath19 is a vector quantity of the @xmath5-phase .",
    "when @xmath20 , we obtain from eq .",
    "the identity concerning the porosity @xmath21 , defined by @xmath22 , as follows @xmath23 in addition , the following averaging theorem can be derived @xmath24",
    "we consider the motion of a porous body suspended in a newtonian fluid .",
    "we assume that the rev scale is much smaller than the size of the body , but is much larger than the pore size .",
    "the porosity and permeability of the body are @xmath21 and @xmath25 , respectively . with the translational velocity @xmath26 and rotational velocity @xmath27 , the porous skeleton of the particle moves rigidly with velocity @xmath28 , where the position vector @xmath29 is measured from the body center . at the surface of the permeable body ,",
    "the microscopic fluid velocity and stress tensor are continuous . since the porous media moves with a rigid - body motion , the translational and rotational velocities of the particle are unchanged even after taking the intrinsic phase average . in the following discussions ,",
    "the interior of the porous particle is assumed to be homogeneous , and @xmath30 is denoted as @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , the fluid flow outside the porous particle is governed by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "as noted in the introduction , darcy s law and the brinkman equation are two main models employed in the literature to treat the flow at the rev scale inside the porous particle . here",
    "we shall derive a more general rev model that includes the transient and nonlinear inertia terms by applying a rigorous volume averaging to the microscopic governing equations in the pores . in this section",
    ", we will present our analysis starting with the intrinsic phase averages , and then develop governing equations for alternative averages based on their inter - relations among different averaged quantities .",
    "the volume averaging process starts with the equations that govern the microscopic fluid flow at the pore scale .",
    "the continuity and momentum equations are @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fluid density , @xmath35 is the fluid velocity , @xmath36 is the pressure , @xmath37 is the acceleration of external body force , @xmath38 is the stress tensor given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the fluid dynamic viscosity , and the superscript @xmath41 denotes the transpose operator .    applying the theorems and to the left hand side of eq . , and",
    "assuming the fluid density to be uniform in the integral volume @xmath0 ( i.e. , incompressible flow ) , we obtain @xmath42    in the above equation , @xmath43 represents the mass flux across the interface from the fluid phase to the solid phase .",
    "since no phase change occurs in the considered system , the area integral of this term will be zero .",
    "thus , the macroscopic continuity equation can be written in the form of the intrinsic average as @xmath44    next turn to the momentum equation .",
    "volume - averaging of eq . with the aid of eq .",
    "leads to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the identity tensor . the third term in eq .",
    "represents the momentum exchange due to the interphase mass transfer .",
    "because of the no - slip condition at the interfacial surface and the assumption of no phase change , this term is zero as @xmath47 .    to obtain the volume - averaged equation for the motion of fluid , the term involving the average of product in eq .",
    ", @xmath48 , needs to be changed to the product of averages . for this purpose",
    ", we follow the spatial decomposition suggested by gray @xcite and hsu and cheng , and define the microscopic velocity @xmath35 by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the intrinsic phase average and the fluctuating component , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath52 provided @xmath50 is well defined .",
    "then , @xmath53 where the second term on the right - hand - side represents the average dispersion vector . as @xmath54 or @xmath55 , the contribution of this term to the momentum balance can be ignored .",
    "because of the tortuous structure resided in the pore spaces and the no - slip condition at the solid - fluid interface , this dispersive term may contribute to the momentum transfer for some special ranges of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , same as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will neglect this term in the present work . actually , hsu and cheng assume that @xmath56 , then the same term in eq .",
    "is of higher order and is neglected .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "can also be rewritten in terms of the intrinsic phase average velocity @xmath57 where the acceleration of @xmath37 is assumed to be constant over the averaging volume . denoting @xmath58 and following the treatment given in refs .",
    "for the first three terms on the right - hand - side of eq . , the following identity holds @xmath59 in which eq .",
    "is incorporated into the derivation .",
    "the interfacial integral on the right - hand side of eq . pertains to the total average drag force due to the interactions between fluid and moving solid , which is denoted as @xmath60    now we seek the expression with appropriate macroscopic variables for the interphase force @xmath61 . it is noted in the literature that the force @xmath61 depends on the relative intrinsic average velocity of the solid and fluid .",
    "several empirical expressions are available in the literature for this interfacial force . for a static porous medium , hsu and cheng and getachew et al .",
    "@xcite performed a dimensional analysis respectively for newtonian and non - newtonian flows to represent the interfacial force . in the context of the relative motion of fluid and solid in the solidification system , ni and beckermann suggested an expression of the fluid - solid interaction forces in analogy with darcy s law , and ganesan and poirier @xcite considered a nonlinear resistance term which is expressed as the square of the relative velocity .",
    "these previous studies suggest that the interphase force @xmath61 can be modeled by the relative velocity between the solid and fluid . in this paper",
    ", we follow the work of hsu and cheng but account for the movement of porous medium to derive the expression of @xmath61 . using the ergun equation , we write @xmath62,\\ ] ] where the permeability @xmath25 and geometric function @xmath63 of the porous medium obey the ergun s expression @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the diameter of grain particles within the porous solid particle .",
    "it is noted that the relation of @xmath66 is employed in the derivation .",
    "using eq . and recognizing that the viscosity and the porosity are constant in the averaging volume , we have @xmath67^t + \\frac{1}{v}\\int_{a_f}\\bigl(\\bm{u}_f\\bm{n}_f+ \\bm{n}_f\\bm{u}_f\\bigr)da\\biggr]\\ ] ] for the surface integral in eq .",
    ", the no - slip boundary condition at the fluid - solid interface ensures that the interfacial fluid velocity can be replaced by the solid velocity .",
    "similar to eq .",
    ", the solid velocity is first decomposed as @xmath68 . noticed that @xmath69 represents the deviation of the microscopic velocity of solid from its intrinsic phase average velocity .",
    "meanwhile , the skeleton of a porous particle behaves as a rigid body motion in which the translational and rotational velocity at each point in the solid region are the same .",
    "this suggests that the interfacial average of @xmath70 is approximately equal to @xmath30 , that is , the surface integral of @xmath69 at the interface of solid and fluid is very small . with this approximation , eq . and combining eq . , the averaged shear stress takes the form : @xmath71^t-        \\langle\\bm{u}_s\\rangle^s\\nabla\\varepsilon-\\nabla\\varepsilon\\langle\\bm{u}_s\\rangle^s\\biggr]\\ ] ] as noted previously , the porosity is uniform over the solid region .",

    "the phase average velocity is used as the superficial velocity for flows in porous media . at the same time , as noted in the introduction , the intrinsic phase average is also employed in the literature .",
    "however , no studies have been conducted to identify the superficial velocity from the volume - averaged velocities when the porous medium moves . in this paper",
    ", galilean invariance of the volume - averaged equations will be numerically investigated , and we use the intrinsic phase average velocity as an alternative to the phase average velocity when performing numerical validations .",
    "it will be shown later in the numerical experiments that galilean invariance can be obtained when using the intrinsic phase average velocity , while the results using the phase average velocity are not galilean invariant .",

    "darcy s law _",
    "when the flow velocity is very low and the flow is steady , the transient term , the inertial term and the quadratic drag force term can be neglected in the momentum equation .",

    "the inertia term is dropped but the viscous dissipation term is retained in the brinkman equation . under similar assumptions ,",
    "eqs . and ( without the external force ) yield @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "this equation has the same form as the brinkman equation , and similar formula has been used in the literature @xcite . in addition , we would like to point out that an equation of the same form as the brinkman equation can not be extracted from the derived volume - averaged equations with the phase average velocity .",
    "this result indicates that the macroscopic equations expressed with the intrinsic phase average velocity would be more preferable .",
    "in summary , we have presented both the macroscopic conservation equations and their dimensionless forms for the fluid flows inside a moving porous medium . in the limiting case as @xmath95 ,",
    "i.e. , in the absence of porous media , one can see that the value of @xmath25 or @xmath84 will become infinite , and eq . or eq . reduces to the navier - stokes equations for pure fluid flows .",
    "while as @xmath96 , i.e. , for a moving solid particle , @xmath25 ( or @xmath84 ) approaches to zero , and thus the inner  fluid \" has the same velocity as the particle .",
    "therefore , in the solution of the derived macroscopic equations , we can use different values of @xmath21 in different regions so that the fluid flows can be calculated throughout the whole domain .",
    "finally , when @xmath91 and expressed with the phase average velocity , eqs . , and reduces to the macroscopic equations derived by hsu and cheng for the flow inside a stationary porous medium .",
    "in this section , in order to investigate the validity of the intrinsic phase average velocity as the superficial velocity for the derived macroscopic equations , numerical experiments will be performed on the flow in a moving porous medium .",
    "the dimensionless equations , eq . are employed as the governing equations , and the lbe model is used as the numerical solver . as noted previously , the macroscopic equations are valid for the flows both inside and outside the porous medium .",
    "hence , the numerical solution of the equations can be carried out on a uniform grid system . for comparison , the other set of macroscopic equations with the phase average velocity , eq .",
    ", are also solved .",
    "the test problem is the flow past a porous cylinder .",
    "the geometric configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ porsquaresch ] , in which the porous cylinder moves along the channel centerline with a constant horizontal velocity @xmath87 .        the simulations can be performed in two frames of reference , that is , the coordinate system is fixed on the cylinder ( fig .",

    "[ porsquaresch ] ( b ) ) . for the sake of description ,",
    "these two cases are denoted by r1 and r2 , respectively .",
    "galilean invariance of the macroscopic equations ensures that the relative motion between the porous cylinder and the flow in the channel is identical in the r1 and r2 frames .",
    "therefore , by directly comparing the results calculated with the intrinsic phase average velocity and/or the phase average velocity in these two cases , we can ascertain which of the two volume - averaged velocities should be used as the superficial velocity .    as for fig .",

    "the profiles of the phase - averaged velocity are also shown in the figure .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     this further demonstrates that galilean invariance can only be satisfied with the intrinsic phase average velocity .",
    "moreover , one can see that , as @xmath21 decreases from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , quantitative difference of the computed results with the phase average velocity between the two frames are more significant .",
    "therefore , these facts confirm that the intrinsic phase average velocity instead of the phase average velocity should be identified as the superficial velocity in the derived macroscopic equations for flows with a moving porous body .",
    "in this paper , mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid flows in a moving porous medium are derived by the technique of volume averaging of the microscopic equations at the pore sacle .",

    "it is found that the intrinsic phase average velocities in the case of moving cylinder agree perfectly with those in the case of stationary cylinder , while the phase average velocities obtained in these two cases are not consistent with each other .",
    "similar results are also obtained for the drag force on the porous cylinder .",
    "furthermore , for the phase average velocity , the difference between the two frames of reference increases as the porosity of the cylinder decreases .",
