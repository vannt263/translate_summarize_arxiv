    "a viable baryogenesis mechanism aims to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , @xmath0 , and the celebrated sakharov conditions state the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis : ( i ) c and cp violation , ( ii ) non - equilibrium , ( iii ) b number violation .",
    "b number violation is present in the hot universe due to sphaleron processes while c is violated in the electroweak sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg ) requires a strong first - order electroweak phase transition ( pt ) to drive the plasma out of equilibrium .",
    "the cp violation is induced by the moving phase boundary and has to be communicated into the symmetric phase , where the sphaleron process is active  @xcite .",
    "thus , the two important aspects of ewbg are transport and cp violation .",
    "this makes it essential to derive transport equations that contain cp - violating quantum effects in a genuine manner .",
    "compared to other baryogenesis mechanisms , ewbg has the attractive property that the relevant energy scale will be accessible by the next generation of collider experiments .",

    "@xcite consists of the mssm extended by a gauge singlet and the superpotential w_nmssm = s h_1 h_2 + s + w_mssm . in this model ,",
    "a @xmath1 or @xmath2 symmetry is imposed to solve the domain wall problem without destabilizing the electroweak hierarchy .",
    "the @xmath3 term is forbidden and only induced after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus the @xmath3 problem is solved .",
    "the discrete symmetries also eliminate the singlet self coupling .",
    "a rather large value of @xmath4 is needed in the nmssm to fulfill current mass bounds on the higgsinos and charginos , which might lead to a landau pole below the gut scale .",
    "in the mssm and its extensions the dominant contribution to baryogenesis comes from the charginos ( higgsino - wino - mixing ) with the mass matrix _",

    "the @xmath3 parameter is proportional to the vev of the singlet field and hence changes during the phase transition , while it is constant in the mssm .",
    "as mentioned above , to obtain unambiguous results for the predicted bau , a formalism is required that treats transport and cp violation in a genuine manner .",
    "this formalism is given by the kadanoff - baym equations that constitute the statistical analog to the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "the simplest example of cp violation in transport equations is given by the one - flavour case with a @xmath6dependent complex phase in the mass term  @xcite , @xmath7 .",

    "hence two - loop contributions from the charginos to the electron edm are naturally small .",
    "the one - loop contributions to the electron edm can , as in the mssm , be reduced by increasing the sfermion masses .",
    "the effective @xmath3 parameter is dynamical in the nmssm and its complex phase changes during the phase transition .",
