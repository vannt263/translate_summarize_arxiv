    "the problem of quantum dissipation has been a long standing and important problem and has been studied in the context of a variety of phenomena , including relaxation phenomena@xcite , quantum cosmological models@xcite and in more recent times , in the context of cold atoms@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the classical dissipative phenomenon , the quantum analogue has a number of additional constraints , which on the one hand make the problem much more complex , and on the other hand makes it more interesting .",
    "of these , the first and the foremost constraint is that of the non - commutative nature of the canonical variables , which leads to stringent conditions on the fluctuation of the canonical co - ordinates , which is commonly known as the heisenberg uncertainity relations .",
    "the second major difference between the classical and quantum dissipative dynaimcs , is the fact that the autocorrelation fucntion of the fluctuating force has a memory effect , which depends on the temperature and the planck constant @xmath0 .",
    "thus , while the force autocorrelation becomes delta - correlated ( markovian ) at high temperatures or @xmath1 0 , leading to recovery of the classical results , the correlation can have a power law dependence on time at very low temperatures@xcite . hence",
    ", a consistent theory has to extrapolate between these two extreme regimes .",
    "another major issue of the quantum dissipative system is the positivity of the density matrix during the non - equilibrium dynamics of the system .",
    "the positivity is necessary for the evolution of the system through physical states .",
    "historically , several approaches have been taken to describe the quantum brownian motion @xcite .",
    "senitzky@xcite , applied the quantum dissipation model to radiating electrmagnetic waves in a cavity and showed that even without the details of the dissipative medium being known , one can formulate a mechanism which leads to quantum dissipation .",
    "one of the first attempts in solving the problem was by zwanzig@xcite , who considered the long range memory effect in the fluctuating force autocorrelation function .",
    "ford , kac and mazur@xcite proposed the system - bath model for the classical and quantum dissipative system , where the system is linearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "a formal treatment of the system plus bath model , was introduced by feyman and vernon@xcite , who derived the influence functional for the effective action of the system , by integrating out the bath degrees of freedom , using the path integral technique .",
    "this method was later used by caldeira and leggett@xcite to derive the high temperature behaviour of the master equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "dekker@xcite proposed a phenomenological master equation where there can be diffusion not only in the position space but also in the momentum space .",
    "dekker and valsakumar@xcite showed that the various diffusion constants must obey a cretain criterion in order to satisfy the positivity condition as shown by lindblad@xcite . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", agarwal@xcite derived some exact results for a dissipative harmonic oscillator .",
    "hu , paz and zhang@xcite did an exact treatment of the same problem and found that the diffusion constants are time dependent .",
    "in all the previous approaches , one of the crucial assumption was that the system and bath are initially decoupled and they get coupled at time @xmath2 .",
    "hakim and ambegaokar@xcite showed that the results would be dramatically different if this assumption were not true and that the initial transients can play a crucial role in the evolution of the density matrix .",
    "there have been some attempts to derive the master equation , phenomenologically , within lindblad form@xcite .    in this paper , we derive the master equation of a quantum harmonic oscillator , coupled to a heat bath , within a scheme , proposed earlier by us@xcite .",
    "unlike some of the earlier approaches@xcite , where the high temperature expansion was used to convert the non - local memory kernel to a local one , we retain the original expression for the memory kernel and taylor expand the non - local terms in the local time scheme .",
    "thus , our results can be valid , in general , for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the problem of the harmonic oscillator and show how one can derive the master equation following our scheme . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the diffusion constants and remark on their behaviour at high temperatures .",
    "we also calculate the limit in which the positivity condition breaks down . in section iv",
    ", we recover the free particle results exactly , in the limit of vanishing oscillator frequency .",
    "we conclude in sectilon v.",
    "we start with a microscopic model for a harmonic oscillator , which is linearly coupled to a bath of oscillators .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath3 of the system consists of three parts , viz . , the hamiltonian for the system @xmath4 , the hamiltonian for the bath @xmath5 , and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath6 , which describes the linear coupling of the system to the heat bath .",
    "the three parts of the total hamiltonian @xmath3 are defined as :    @xmath7    [ hamil ]    where , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the position and momentum coordinates of the system , with mass @xmath10 , oscillator frequency @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the coordinates of the bath oscillators , with mass @xmath14 and the frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the coupling constant between the system and the @xmath16 bath oscillators is denoted by @xmath17 .    in order to derive a master equation of the reduced density matrix",
    ", we use the feynman - vernon procedure to calculate the effective action , after integrating out the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume that at @xmath2 both the system and the bath are uncorrelated with each other , so that we can write the total initial density matrix of the whole system as the direct product of the initial density matrices of the system and the bath , respectively . following the work of feynman and vernon@xcite , the time evolution of the density matrix is given in terms of the influence functional , as , @xmath18 where the quantity @xmath19 propagates the density matrix @xmath20 from an initial time to the density matrix @xmath21 at final time , and is given by , @xmath22\\right ) \\label{propagator}\\ ] ] integrating out the bath degrees of freedom , we obtain the nonlocal effective action for the system@xcite , given by , @xmath23-s_{a}[q_{2}])+\\int_{0}^{t}(\\sigma_{r}+\\sigma_{i})d\\tau \\label{seff_new}\\ ] ] where , @xmath24 corresponds to the action of system corresponding to eq .",
