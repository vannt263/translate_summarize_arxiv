    "even - even nuclei have long been known to exhibit a wide range of collective behavior .",
    "the broadest classification of collective behavior is into three groups : pairing , vibrational , and rotational collectivity@xcite .",
    "the first is in analogy with superconductivity in metals , and the latter two based upon quadrupole deformations of a liquid drop .",
    "the spectral signatures of collectivity are :    \\(1 ) the quantum numbers of the ground state .",
    "in particular for pairing one expects @xmath0 .",
    "\\(2 ) regularities in the excitation energies , in particular among the lowest @xmath1 states relative to the @xmath2 ground state .",
    "particularly useful measures are the ratios @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for pairing , vibrational , and rotational",
    "collectivity one expects @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "\\(3 ) strong , correlated b(e2 ) transition strengths , which measure the collectivity of the wavefunctions .",
    "( in particular one expects strong intraband transitions and weak interband transitions , but we will not consider that further here . ) traditionally one either compares b(e2 ) strengths to the single - particle limit ( weisskopf units ) or ratios of b(e2)s .",
    "simple and successful models of collectivity , usually based upon group theory , are well known @xcite ; in fact more sophisticated classifications are possible and are used , but we do not consider them here .    in order to understand the roots of collectivity , start from the coordinate - space hamiltonian @xmath7 with a chosen nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "although there are many ways to solve this hamiltonian , we consider the shell - model route : one chooses a single - particle basis @xmath8 and writes the hamiltonian in occupation space using second quantization , where @xmath9 creates a particle in the single - particle state @xmath10 , @xmath11 the @xmath12 s are the single - particle energies and the @xmath13 s are the two - body matrix elements , in principle computed from antisymmeterized integrals of the nucleon - nucleon potential : @xmath14\\ ] ]    any interacting shell - model code , such as the one we use , redstick@xcite , reads in : the list of valence single - particle states ( such as the @xmath15-@xmath16-@xmath17 or @xmath18 space or the @xmath19-@xmath20-@xmath21-@xmath22 or @xmath23 space ) ; information on the _ many - body _ space , such as valence protons and neutrons ; and finally a list of the single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements , both of which are read in as numbers .",
    "the two - body matrix elements also conserve angular momentum @xmath24 and frequently , but not always , isospin @xmath25 .    as mentioned , there exist simple algebraic models of collectivity .",
    "importantly , they have representations both in fermion and boson spaces , with the two - body matrix elements derived from the group generators . furthermore",
    ", these algebra - based models _ describe well much of the experimental spectra of even - even nuclides_. therefore , the default assumption has long been that the data in turn imply that the real nuclear interaction must have buried deep inside strongly `` algebraic '' components .",
    "this assumption can be tested by sampling a large number of hamiltonians and seeing if any signatures of collectivity arise @xcite .",
    "the simplest test is to replace the two - body matrix elements with random numbers , independent except that angular momentum @xmath24 ( and isospin @xmath25 ) is ( are ) conserved .",
    "this is known as the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) and , as long as the ensemble is symmetric about zero , the results are broadly insensitive to the details of the distribution@xcite , e.g. weighting with @xmath24 , uniform or gaussian distribution , etc .",
    "( the displaced tbre , or dtbre@xcite , which is _ not _ symmetric about zero , will be discussed briefly below . )",
    "the tbre was originally used to investigate quantum chaos@xcite , and so such investigations considered only states with the same quantum numbers .",
    "it was not until a few years ago that investigations compared spectral properties of states with different quantum numbers@xcite .",
    "use of the tbre is straightforward .",
    "a sample interaction from the ensemble is generated , and fed into a shell - model diagonalization code .",
    "for the tbre this means that @xmath26 an independent random number .",
    "the many - body system is referenced by its nuclear physics analog , e.g. , `` @xmath27o '' mean six `` neutrons '' ( identical fermions ) in an @xmath18 valence space , although the actual many - body space is abstracted and is no longer tied to , for example , the radial wavefunctions . the output ( for example , the angular momentum of the ground state ) is stored in a file for later analysis .",
    "typically one compiles several hundred or even several thousand runs to generate good statistics .",
    "previous investigations into the properties of the tbre in fermion systems yielded the following results :    @xmath28 dominance of ground states with @xmath29 .",
    "( hereafter we will drop parity , as most of the model spaces investigated do not have abnormal parity states . ) specifically , in many - body spaces where the fraction of @xmath30 states is small , typically 4 - 11 % , after diagonalization of hamiltonians drawn from the tbre , the fraction of ground states with @xmath30 is 45 - 70% .",
    "this is the best known result from random interactions .",
    "@xmath28 pairing - like behavior@xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath30 ground states , one also finds odd - even staggering of ground state binding energies , and a ground state `` gap . ''     for tbre ( solid line ) and",
    "rqqe ( dashed line ) for ( a ) @xmath31 mg ; ( b ) @xmath32si ; ( c ) @xmath27o ; ( d ) @xmath33ca . ]    for a pairing system , one expects @xmath34 .",
    "1 shows the distribution of @xmath35 over a thousand samples from the tbre for several different many - fermion systems .",
    "all are peaked near 1 ( pairing ) , but with broad distributions that include @xmath36 ( vibration ) and 3.33 ( rotational ) .",
    "many - boson systems , in particular the ibm-1 , have also been studied using the tbre , also yielding a dominance of @xmath30 ground states@xcite .",
    "in contrast to fermion systems , however , the distribution of @xmath35 is sharply peaked at 2 and 3.33 .",
    "bijker and frank studied the ratio @xmath37 , which turns out for ibm-1 to be strongly correlated with @xmath35 and agrees with analytic algebraic limits ; plots of such correlations we will call bijker - frank plots .",
    "this is interpreted as evidence for band structure in bosons systems with random interactions .",
    "the boson results have been successfully explained using a mean - field analysis@xcite .",
    "there have been numerous papers `` explaining '' the fermion results ; for reviews see@xcite .",
    "much of the focus has been on the predominance of @xmath30 ground states ; few have considered band structure beyond @xmath38 , save for a few exceptions @xcite . in fig .",

    "2(a ) shows results using `` realistic '' interactions calculations in the @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite shell ; 2(b)-(d ) are results for the tbre in several different fermion systems .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we get a strong correlation that follows exactly the naive predictions for pairing , vibrational , and rotational collectivity .",
    "( although we do not show it , this result does not appear in single-@xmath40 systems frequently used as testbeds for random interactions ) .",
    "this higher - order band structure is a challenge to any claim to understanding random interactions results for fermion systems . although we do not show it , similar ( and sharper ) results occur in the ibm with random interactions .",

    "( for the b(e2 ) transitions in tbre , for lack of other constraints we assume harmonic - oscillator radial wavefunctions . )",

    "to summarize : fermion systems with tbre interactions show some signatures of collectivity , but much more weakly than boson systems .",
    "why is not understood .",
    "this motivates the next section .",
    "one way to probe the difference between random interactions in boson and fermion systems is to search for a random ensemble that yield stronger collective structure in fermion systems .",
    "one proposal is the displaced tbre , or dtbre , where the two - body matrix elements are given a constant displacement . while an appealing suggestion",
    ", we have found that the dtbre displays collective behavior only for a handful of even - even systems .",
    "even worse , as discussed below , the resulting ensemble is not very `` random . ''",
    "therefore , inspired by the `` consistent - q '' formulation in the interacting boson model@xcite , we propose the following .",
    "consider the general one - body operator of angular momentum rank 2 : @xmath45_{2m}.\\ ] ] if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 is the standard quadrupole operator .",
    "but instead we choose the @xmath48 randomly .",
    "we then define the _ random quadrupole - quadrupole ensemble _ to be interactions @xmath49 the antisymmeterized matrix elements are @xmath50 ( here and above we have left out details of the angular momentum coupling which are straightforward , if tedious , to include ) .",
    "there is also a one - body single - particle energy induced by normal ordering of the operators .",
    "any member interaction of the rqqe has fewer random parameters than the tbre .",
    "for example , in the @xmath18 shell , the tbre has 63 independent , randomly generated two - body matrix elements , while the rqqe , if one assumes time - reversal symmetry ( that is , @xmath51 ) , has only 5 independent parameters ; for the @xmath23 shell , the tbre has 195 independent matrix elements and the rqqe has 9 .",
    "the rqqe has @xmath30 ground states @xmath52 for _ all _ even - even nuclides we tried . in figs .",
    "1 - 4 we show other results for the rqqe alongside those for the tbre . to summarize them :    @xmath28 in fig .   1",
    "we see @xmath35 for the rqqe peaks between 2 and 3.3 , that is , somewhere between vibrational and rotational .",
    "@xmath28 although not shown , the correlation of @xmath39 vs. @xmath35 for the rqqe is similar to that of the tbre in fig .  2 .",

    "3(c)-(d ) , the bijker - frank plot shows the correlation between ratios of b(e2)s and @xmath35 . unlike in the tbre",
    ", the rqqe shows much stronger correlation .",
    "3(c ) uses the `` standard '' quadrupole transition operator , assuming harmonic oscillator single - particle states ; fig .",
    "3(d ) uses a `` consistent '' quadrupole transition operator , the same @xmath53 used in the hamiltonian .",
    "both results are similar , although the consistent - quadrupole results are sharper .",
    "@xmath28 in fig .",
    "4(c)-(d ) we show correlations in b(e2)s in the yrast band 6 - 4 - 2 - 0 .",

    "some surprising , previously unknown correlations show up even in the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) .",
    "we proposed a new `` random '' ensemble , the random quadrupole - quadrupole ensemble ( rqqe ) , and found it had significantly sharper signatures of collectivity than the tbre .",
    "while this does not solve the puzzle of collectivity , it does demonstrate that typical spectral signatures of collectivity do not rigorously require the standard elliot quadrupole - quadrupole or su(3 ) interaction .",
    "of course , collective behavior is not surprising if the `` ensemble '' is not very random , and we looked at the dot product between ground state wavefunctions : the rqqe deviates from the expected random distribution but much less so than the displaced tbre or dtbre ."
