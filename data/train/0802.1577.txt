    "the _ hartree - fock model with temperature _ is a simple extension of the hartree - fock model  @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the _ free energy _ determines an equilibrium state in the presence of a thermal noise , whose effect is to populate electronic states corresponding to excited energy levels .",
    "compared to the energy functional of the standard hartree - fock model , the free energy  of the hartree - fock model with temperature  @xmath0 has an additional term , which is the product of @xmath0 with an entropy term .",
    "the standard hartree - fock model  corresponds to the limit case @xmath1 .",
    "the hartree - fock model with temperature  has been studied @xcite in the case of an entropy based on the function @xmath2 .",
    "the main drawback in this case is that the free energy  is unbounded from below when the model is considered in the euclidean space .",
    "it has been recently established @xcite that the free energy  for a quantum system described by a _",
    "mixed state _ or a density operator , in the presence of an external potential @xmath3 , can be uniformly bounded from below by a functional depending on @xmath3 .",
    "this follows from interpolation estimates of gagliardo - nirenberg type for systems , which are equivalent to lieb - thirring inequalities .",
    "the result of course depends on the convex function on which the entropy is based .",
    "we shall not make a direct use of such inequalities , but our approach will rely on classes of entropies for which the free energy  is well defined and semi - bounded if @xmath4 .    we shall add another ingredient , which comes from the modeling in quantum mechanics .",
    "we will impose that _ occupation numbers _ take values in @xmath5 $ ] because the electrons are fermions .",
    "this can be formalized by considering entropies based on convex functions with support in @xmath5 $ ] and by assuming that they take infinite values on @xmath6\\,$ ] . in this paper",
    ", we shall adopt the language of _ density operators _ : a state of the system is represented by a trace - class self - adjoint operator @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 .",
    "occupation numbers @xmath9 are the eigenvalues of the density operator : . when only a finite number of eigenvalues is non - zero , the operator is of finite rank .",
    "we shall say that it describes a _ pure state _",
    "when all non - zero occupation numbers are equal to  @xmath10 , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 is an orthogonal projector .",
    "minimizers of the hartree - fock model  are of this form , but this will not be the case in general when the temperature @xmath11 is big enough : in this case the corresponding minimizer is a _",
    "mixed state , _ that has some non - integer eigenvalues .",
    "a practical consequence of the positivity of the occupation numbers is that the exchange term is dominated by the poisson term in the hartree - fock energy functional . in the case of a bounded domain ,",
    "not much is changed when the temperature is turned on . a pure hartree model ( without the exchange term ) , which is usually called the schrdinger - poisson system , has already been studied @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to deal with the whole euclidean space and we shall see that many families of free energies can be considered , each of them giving rise to minimizers under some conditions which eventually depend on the temperature .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "similar phenomena have indeed been observed in other models of mechanics , for instance in kinetic theory .",
    "the most studied example is probably the case of self - gravitating gases in astrophysics . in such models ,",
    "relaxation mechanisms are not so well known , but stationary states can be observed and the corresponding free energy  functional , which is also called the energy - casimir functional , can then be recovered quite easily .",
    "stationary solutions being characterized as minimizers of the free energy , orbital stability appears as a simple consequence for the collisionless version of the equation @xcite . in presence of collisions ,",
    "the picture is compatible with hydrodynamic or diffusive limits , which provides a very natural link with nonlinear diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "similar results are known in other frameworks like fluid mechanics @xcite or nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite .",
    "the striking observation is that many different stationary states can be used simultaneously for measuring the orbital stability of a given solution to the cauchy problem .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the mathematical aspects of this model .",
    "we consider _ free energy _",
    "functionals of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hartree - fock energy and the entropy takes the form @xmath14 @xmath15 being a convex function on @xmath5\\,$ ] .",
    "we study under which conditions ( for instance on the total number of electrons , or global charge ) such a free energy has a minimizer .",
    "next we consider the stability of the associated time - dependent equation describing the evolution of the state @xmath16 , @xmath17\\ ; , \\label{time - dependent_intro}\\ ] ] which is called the _ von neumann equation .",
    "_ here @xmath18 is a self - adjoint operator depending on @xmath16 but not on the function @xmath15 .",
    "orbital stability is then a straightforward consequence of the variational method and the existence theory for the cauchy problem @xcite .",
    "since we consider a large class of entropies based on various functions @xmath19 , we thereby construct a large class of associated stable states of the time - dependent equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we state our main results and",
    "only give the shortest proofs .",
    "other proofs are detailed in section  [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "the hartree - fock energy , written in terms of the density matrix @xmath16 , reads @xmath20 the first term of the right hand side of is the kinetic energy of the electrons and the second is the electrostatic interaction with a classical nucleus of charge @xmath21 , located at @xmath22 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath23 for the classical coulomb interaction between two densities of charge @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "such a quantity is well - defined as soon as , for instance , @xmath26 , by the hardy - littlewood - sobolev inequality @xcite .",
