    "the measurements of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and the neutron gave the first hints at an internal structure of the nucleon , and a theory of the nucleon can not be considered satisfactory if it is not able to reproduce the form factor data . for a long time",
    ", the overall trend of the experimental results for small and moderate values of the momentum transfer @xmath0 could be described reasonably well by phenomenological ( dipole ) fits @xmath1 with @xmath2 and the magnetic moments @xmath3 in units of nuclear magnetons .",
    "recently , the form factors of the nucleon have been studied experimentally with high precision and deviations from this uniform dipole form have been observed , both at very small @xmath0  @xcite and in the region above @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to derive the nucleon form factors from qcd .",
    "since form factors are typical low - energy quantities , perturbation theory in terms of quarks and gluons is useless for this purpose and a non - perturbative method is needed .",
    "if one wants to avoid additional assumptions or models , one is essentially restricted to lattice qcd and monte carlo simulations . in view of the importance of nucleon form factors and",
    "the amount of experimental data available , it is surprising that there are only a few lattice investigations of form factors in the last years  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a detailed account of our results for the nucleon form factors obtained in quenched monte carlo simulations with non - perturbatively @xmath5-improved wilson fermions .",
    "we shall pay particular attention to the chiral extrapolation and compare with formulae from chiral effective field theory previously used for studies of the magnetic moments .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",

    "[ sect : first ] , we investigate the quark - mass dependence of the form factors in more detail on a phenomenological basis in sec .",
    "[ sect : invest ] .",
    "we find that our data are in qualitative agreement with the recently observed deviations  @xcite from the uniform dipole parametrization of the proton form factors . in sec .",
    "[ sect : chpt ] we collect and discuss formulae from chiral effective field theory , which are confronted with our monte carlo results in sec .",

    "the appendixes contain a short discussion of the pion mass dependence of the nucleon mass as well as tables of the form factors and of the corresponding dipole fits .",
    "experimentally , the nucleon form factors are measured via electron scattering .",
    "because the fine structure constant is so small , it is justified to describe this process in terms of one - photon exchange .",
    "so the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath6 with the electromagnetic current @xmath7 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the nucleon momenta , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the electron momenta , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 ,  are the corresponding spin vectors .",
    "the momentum transfer is defined as @xmath14 . with the help of the form factors @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 the nucleon matrix element can be decomposed as @xmath17 u(p , s)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the mass of the nucleon . from the kinematics of the scattering process",
    ", it can easily be seen that @xmath19 . in the following",
    ", we shall often use the new variable @xmath20 .",
    "we have @xmath21 ( in the proton ) as @xmath22 is a conserved current , while @xmath23 measures the anomalous magnetic moment in nuclear magnetons . for a classical point particle , both form factors are independent of @xmath0 , so deviations from this behavior tell us something about the extended nature of the nucleon . in electron scattering , @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 are usually re - written in terms of the electric and magnetic sachs form factors @xmath26 as then the ( unpolarized ) cross section becomes a linear combination of squares of the form factors .    throughout the whole paper",
    "we assume flavor su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "hence we can decompose the form factors into isovector and isoscalar components . in terms of the proton and neutron form",
    "factors the isovector form factors are given by @xmath27 such that @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) being the isovector ( anomalous ) magnetic moment @xmath31 . in the actual simulations we do not work directly with these definitions when we calculate the isovector form factors .",
    "we use the relation @xmath32 and compute the isovector form factors from proton matrix elements of the current @xmath33 instead of evaluating the proton and neutron matrix elements of the electromagnetic current separately and then taking the difference .",
    "similarly one could use the isoscalar current @xmath34 for the computation of isoscalar form factors , but we have not done so , since in the isoscalar sector there are considerable uncertainties anyway due to the neglected quark - line disconnected contributions .",

    "hence we determined @xmath43 and @xmath44 from an ( uncorrelated ) minuit fit of all these @xmath42s with the corresponding expressions ( [ r4unpol ] ) - ( [ rjpol ] ) omitting all data points where the error for @xmath42 was larger than 25% .",
    "the results are collected in the tables in appendix  b. a missing entry indicates a case where the corresponding form factor could not be extracted , e.g.  because we did not have sufficiently many @xmath42s with less than 25% error .",
    "the nucleon masses used can be found in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the corresponding errors were , however , not taken into account when computing the errors of the form factors .",
    "varying the nucleon masses within one standard deviation changed the form factors only by fractions of the quoted statistical error .",
    "in general , the nucleon three - point functions consist of a quark - line connected contribution and a quark - line disconnected piece .",
    "unfortunately , the quark - line disconnected piece is very hard to compute ( for some recent attempts see refs .",
    "therefore it is usually neglected , leading to one more source of systematic uncertainty . however , in the case of exact isospin invariance the disconnected contribution drops out in non - singlet quantities like the isovector form factors .",
    "that is why the isovector form factors ( tables  [ tab : clover60isov ] - [ tab : clover64isov ] ) are our favorite observables .",
    "nevertheless , we have also computed the proton form factors separately ignoring the disconnected contributions .",
    "the results are given in tables  [ tab : clover60prot ] - [ tab : clover64prot ] .",
    "regrettably , meaningful values of the electric form factor of the neutron could not be extracted from our data ( for a more successful attempt see ref .",
    "the results for the neutron magnetic form factor are collected in tables  [ tab : clover60neut ] - [ tab : clover64neut ] .",
    "note that the isovector form factors have been computed directly ( cf .",
    "( [ isovector ] ) ) and not as the difference of the proton and neutron form factors .",
    "the quark masses in our simulations are considerably larger than in reality leading to pion masses above 500 mev",
    ". hence we can not compare our results with experimental data without performing a chiral extrapolation . in a first analysis of the proton results ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) we assumed a linear quark - mass dependence of the form factors .",
    "more precisely , we proceeded as follows .",
    "schematically , the relation between a ratio @xmath42 ( three - point function / two - point function ) and the form factors @xmath45 , @xmath46 can be written in the form @xmath47 with known coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 for each data point characterized by the momenta , the quark mass , the spin projection and the space - time component of the current . assuming a linear quark - mass dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 we performed a 4-parameter fit , @xmath50 of all ratios @xmath42 belonging to the same value of @xmath41 in the chiral limit .",
    "the resulting form factors in the chiral limit are typically larger than the experimental data .",
    "they can be fitted with a dipole form , but the masses from these fits are considerably larger than their phenomenological counterparts  @xcite .    what could be the reason for this discrepancy ?",
    "several possibilities suggest themselves : finite - size effects , quenching errors , cut - off effects or uncertainties in the chiral extrapolation .",
    "the length @xmath51 of the spatial boxes in our simulations is such that the inequality @xmath52 holds in all cases .",
    "previous experience suggests that in the quenched approximation this is sufficient to exclude considerable distortions of the results due to the finite volume .",
    "this assumption is confirmed by simulations with wilson fermions , where we have data on different volumes .",
    "quenching errors are much more difficult to control .",
    "however , first simulations with dynamical fermions indicate that  for the rather heavy quarks we can deal with  the form factors do not change very much upon unquenching  @xcite .",
    "having monte carlo data for three different lattice spacings ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) we can test for cut - off effects in the chirally extrapolated form factors , but we find them to be hardly significant .",
    "so our chiral extrapolation ought to be reconsidered .",
    "indeed , the chiral extrapolation of lattice data has been discussed intensively in the recent literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and it has been pointed out that the issue is highly non - trivial . therefore we shall examine the quark - mass dependence of our form factors in more detail .",
    "ideally , one would like to identify a regime of parameters ( quark masses in particular ) where contact with chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) can be made on the basis of results like those presented for the nucleon form factors in ref .",
    "once the range of applicability of these low - energy effective field theories has been established , one can use them for a safe extrapolation to smaller masses .",
    "however , these schemes do not work for arbitrarily large quark masses ( or pion masses ) , nor for arbitrarily large values of @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , the expressions for the form factors worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite can be trusted only up to @xmath53 ( see the discussion in sec .  [",
    "sect : chpt.ff ] below ) .",
    "unfortunately , from our lattice simulations we only have data for values of @xmath41 which barely touch the interval @xmath54",
    ". therefore we shall try to describe the @xmath41 dependence of the lattice data for each quark mass by a suitable ansatz ( of dipole type ) and then study the mass dependence of the corresponding parameters .",
    "the fit ansatz will also serve as an extrapolation of the magnetic form factor down to @xmath55 .",
    "since we can not compute @xmath56 directly , such an extrapolation is required anyway to determine the magnetic moment .",
    "( for a different method , which does not require an extrapolation , see ref .  @xcite . ) in sec .",
    "[ sect : disc ] we shall come back to a comparison with cheft .",
    "the analysis of our form factor data sketched in sec .  [ sect : first ] yielded results in the chiral limit without much control over the approach to that limit . in this section",
    "we want to study the quark - mass dependence of the form factors more thoroughly .",
    "as already mentioned , to this end we have to make use of a suitable description of the @xmath41 dependence .",
    "motivated by the fact that the experimentally measured form factors at small values of @xmath41 can be described by a dipole form ( cf .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) ) we fitted our data with the ansatz @xmath57 in the case of the form factors @xmath45 ( @xmath24 ) we fixed @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "note that we do not require the dipole masses in the two form factors to coincide .",
    "thus our ansatz can accomodate deviations of the ratio @xmath60 from unity as they have been observed in recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for all masses considered in our simulations the lattice data can be described rather well by a dipole ansatz . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipfit ] we show examples of our data ( for @xmath61 ) together with the dipole fits .",
    "the fit results are collected in table  [ tab : clover.dipisov ] for the isovector form factors , in table  [ tab : clover.dipprot ] for the proton form factors and in table  [ tab : clover.dipneut ] for the magnetic form factor of the neutron .",

    "[ fig : lfitmass ] , [ fig : lfitmom ] we plot the isovector electric dipole mass @xmath64 , the isovector magnetic dipole mass @xmath65 and the isovector magnetic moment @xmath29 ( extracted from the sachs form factors ) versus @xmath66 .",
    "we make the following observations .",
    "+         scaling violations in the dipole masses seem to be smaller than the statistical accuracy , since the results do not show a definite trend as @xmath67 grows from 6.0 to 6.4 . for the magnetic moments the situation is less clear",
    ". there might be some systematic shift , though not much larger than the statistical errors .",
    "the electric dipole masses tend to become slightly smaller than the magnetic dipole masses as the pion mass decreases though it is not clear whether this difference is statistically significant .",
    "this behavior agrees qualitatively with the recent jlab data  @xcite for @xmath68 in the proton ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ratio ] below ) .",
    "the data for the electric dipole masses suggest a linear dependence on @xmath66 . therefore we could not resist temptation to perform linear fits of the dipole masses and moments ( extracted from the sachs form factors ) in tables  [ tab : clover.dipisov ] - [ tab : clover.dipneut ] in order to obtain values at the physical pion mass .",
    "of course , at some point the singularities and non - analyticities arising from the goldstone bosons of qcd must show up and will in some observables lead to a departure from the simple linear behavior .",
    "it is however conceivable that this happens only at rather small pion masses ( perhaps even only below the physical pion mass ) and thus does not influence the value at the physical pion mass too strongly .",
    "one can try to combine the leading non - analytic behavior of chiral perturbation theory with a linear dependence on @xmath69 as it is expected at large quark mass in order to obtain an interpolation formula valid both at small and at large masses .",
