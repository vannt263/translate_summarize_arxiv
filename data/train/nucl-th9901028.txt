    "the study of strangeness - rich systems is of fundamental importance in understanding relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , some astrophysical problems  @xcite , and the existence ( or nonexistence ) of certain hypernuclei .",
    "strangeness - rich systems can be exotic multiquark systems consisting of up ( @xmath5 ) , down ( @xmath6 ) , and strange ( @xmath7 ) quarks ; like the elusive @xmath8 dibaryon , a 6-quark @xmath9 system predicted by jaffe  @xcite .",
    "but they can also simply be bound states of nucleons ( @xmath10 ) , hyperons ( @xmath11 ) , and cascades ( @xmath12 ) . in order to get a better handle on the latter possibility",
    ", we are in need of potential models which describe all possible interactions between nucleons , hyperons , and cascades .",
    "although there is a wealth of accurate @xmath13 scattering data , which allows us to construct accurate @xmath13 potential models , there are only a few @xmath14 scattering data , and there are no scattering data at all for the multi - strange systems @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the potential models for these multi - strange interactions require input from elsewhere to define them .",
    "one possibility is to use experimental information on bound states of hypernuclei .",
    "double-@xmath19 hypernuclei , for example , provide information on the @xmath20 and @xmath16 interactions . however , here one has to be careful since the extracted information is , in a sense , `` contaminated '' by many - body effects . furthermore , there are no hypernuclear experimental data yet which could provide information on the @xmath17 or @xmath18 interactions .    in this paper ,",
    "we therefore consider a second possibility , which is to assume that the potentials obey a ( slightly broken ) su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the potentials are parametrized in terms of one - boson exchanges , which we believe to be a very good and , certainly , effective first approximation in modeling the complete interaction .",
    "extensions beyond the one - meson - exchange mechanism , like the inclusion of two - meson exchanges and @xmath21 and @xmath22 isobars in intermediate states , are expected to be of lesser importance .",
    "the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry allows us to determine all coupling constants in a fit to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 scattering data , which also defines all the coupling constants needed to describe the multi - strange interactions .",
    "however , the fit to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 data still allows for some freedom in the parameters , and so in ref .",
    "@xcite we have constructed six different @xmath14 models .",
    "the different models are characterized by different choices for the magnetic vector @xmath23 ratio , @xmath24 , which serves to produce different scattering lengths in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels , but at the same time allows all models to describe the available @xmath14 ( and @xmath13 ) scattering data equally well .",
    "the values chosen for @xmath24 range from 0.4447 ( model nsc97a ) to 0.3647 ( model nsc97f ) . within each model , there are now no free parameters left , and so each parameter set defines a baryon - baryon potential which models all possible two - baryon interactions .",
    "although most of the details on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 interactions are well - known and can be found elsewhere , we have here decided to include them in order to present a complete picture of how our baryon - baryon potentials are defined .",

    "all coupling constants can be expressed in terms of only four parameters .",
    "the explicit expressions can be found in ref .",
    "the @xmath42-hyperon is an isovector with phase chosen such  @xcite that @xmath43 this definition for @xmath44 differs from the standard condon and shortley phase convention  @xcite by a minus sign .",
    "this means that , in working out the isospin multiplet for each coupling constant in eq .",
    "( [ lint ] ) , each @xmath44 entering or leaving an interaction vertex has to be assigned an extra minus sign .",
    "however , if the potential is first evaluated on the isospin basis and then , via an isospin rotation , transformed to the potential on the physical particle basis ( see below ) , this extra minus sign will be automatically accounted for .    given the interaction lagrangian ( [ lint ] ) and a theoretical scheme for deriving the potential representing a particular feynman diagram , it is now straightforward to derive the one - meson - exchange baryon - baryon potentials .",
    "we follow the thompson approach  @xcite and expressions for the potential in momentum space can be found in ref .",
    "unfortunately , the expressions for the potential in configuration space in this reference contain a number of typographical errors ; the corrected expressions are given in the appendix of our previous publication on the @xmath14 potentials  @xcite .",
    "since the nucleons have strangeness @xmath3 , the hyperons @xmath4 , and the cascades @xmath0 , the possible baryon - baryon interaction channels can be classified according to their total strangeness , ranging from @xmath3 for @xmath13 to @xmath45 for @xmath18 .",
    "apart from the wealth of accurate @xmath13 scattering data for the total strangeness @xmath3 sector , there are only a few @xmath14 scattering data for the @xmath4 sector , while there are no data at all for the @xmath46 sectors .",
    "we therefore believe that at this stage it is not yet worthwhile to explicitly account for the small mass differences between the specific charge states of the baryons and mesons ; i.e. , we use average masses , isospin is a good quantum number , and the potentials are calculated on the isospin basis .",
    "the possible channels on the isospin basis are given in table  [ tabisobasis ] .",
    "however , the lippmann - schwinger or schrdinger equation is solved for the physical particle channels , and so scattering observables are calculated using the proper physical baryon masses .",
    "the possible channels on the physical particle basis can be classified according to the total charge @xmath47 ; these are given in table  [ tabpartbasis ] .",
    "the corresponding potentials are obtained from the potential on the isospin basis by making the appropriate isospin rotation .",
    "the matrix elements of the isospin rotation matrices are nothing else but the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the two baryon isospins making up the total isospin .",
    "( note that this is the reason why the potential on the particle basis , obtained from applying an isospin rotation to the potential on the isospin basis , will have the correct sign for any coupling constant on a vertex , including the ones involving a @xmath44 . )",
    "we should point out that this approach does not result in a high - precision potential for @xmath13 scattering in the @xmath3 sector .",
    "for one thing , any @xmath13 potential which is claimed to be of high precision should at least explicitly account for the fact that the neutral pion and charged pion have different masses , because one - pion exchange is the longest - range and most important part of the interaction .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that the @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 partial waves show a sizable breaking of charge independence , which can not be explained within a simple one - boson - exchange model like the one presented here , but requires the inclusion of meson mixing , two - meson exchange , and/or extra phenomenological parameters .",
    "the @xmath13 potential presented here is only included for reasons of completeness ; although it certainly describes the qualitative features of the baryon - baryon potential for the @xmath27 baryon octet in the @xmath3 sector very well , for high - accuracy quantitative calculations we recommend that one uses one of the recently constructed high - precision @xmath13 models  @xcite .    in order to construct the potentials on the isospin basis , we need the matrix elements of the various meson exchanges between particular isospin states .",
    "the way to calculate these matrix elements is outlined , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tabiso ] , where we use the pseudoscalar mesons as a specific example .",
    "the entries also include factors @xmath51 whenever the initial or final state consists of two identical particles , and the exchange operator @xmath52 for the contributions where the final - state baryons have been interchanged .",
    "the exchange operator @xmath52 has the value @xmath53 for even-@xmath54 singlet and odd-@xmath54 triplet partial waves , and @xmath55 for odd-@xmath54 singlet and even-@xmath54 triplet partial waves . for total strangeness @xmath4 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the final - state interchanged diagram only occurs when the exchanged meson carries strangeness ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "an interesting subtlety is that in the entry for @xmath61 the direct and exchange contributions carry _ different _ coupling constants , which is the reason why they are not added together , but are given separately .",
    "finally , in constructing the potentials on the particle basis by applying the appropriate isospin rotation to the potential on the isospin basis , care must be taken that in a number of cases the two initial - state and/or final - state baryons belong to different charge states within the same isospin multiplet . in those cases ,",
    "the multiplication with the identical - particle symmetry factor @xmath51 has to be undone . in practice",
    ", this means that for each initial state or final state consisting of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , or @xmath66 , the potential has to be multiplied by @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that there is nothing that prohibits us from constructing the potentials directly on the particle basis , explicitly accounting for all the different charged states of the baryons and mesons .",
    "although this _ is _ the only proper way if one is to construct a high - precision @xmath13 potential for the @xmath3 sector , we again note that the scattering data to define the @xmath4 sector are very scarce , and that there are no scattering data at all to define the @xmath46 sectors .",
    "hence , we argue that at this stage such a refinement does not yet seem to be worth the effort .",
    "the fact that the initial - state and final - state baryons in the @xmath4 , @xmath68 , and @xmath1 sectors can consist of different baryons leads to so - called transition potentials .",
    "their presence turns the lippmann - schwinger or schrdinger equation into a coupled - channel matrix equation where the different channels open up depending on whether the on - shell energy exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "let us consider the case where particle 1 with laboratory momentum @xmath69 scatters off particle 2 , which is at rest in the laboratory frame , and that they represent the lowest - mass two - baryon state for a specific @xmath70 interaction channel .",
    "the total energy squared is then given by @xmath71 where the 1 in parentheses refers to the fact that we are considering the lowest - mass ( i.e. , first channel ) two - baryon state .",
    "the center - off - mass ( cm ) momentum squared in each channel @xmath72 within this @xmath70 coupled - channel system is then given by @xmath73                                 \\left[s-\\{m_1(i)-m_2(i)\\}^2\\right].\\ ] ] clearly , for small values of @xmath74 we find that @xmath75 , @xmath76 , is negative , which means that these channels are closed .",
    "a discussion of how to handle the presence of closed channels is given , for example , in ref .",
    "the thresholds where the higher - mass channels open up are as follows . for @xmath77",
    ": @xmath78 for @xmath79 : @xmath80 for @xmath81 : @xmath82 for @xmath83 : @xmath84 for @xmath85 : @xmath86 for @xmath87 : @xmath88 for @xmath89 : @xmath90 if one uses the nonrelativistic approximation to relate the laboratory momentum and total energy , the threshold momenta are found to be lower , where the difference can be as large as 75 mev/@xmath91 .      following the scheme of refs .",
    "@xcite , we start out from the four - dimensional one - meson - exchange feynman diagram and end up with two three - dimensional time - ordered diagrams . the propagator ( energy denominator ) for these two diagrams reads @xmath92.\\ ] ] here , @xmath93 is the total energy and @xmath94 , with @xmath95 the meson mass and @xmath96 the momentum transfer . in the static approximation @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where we have included a superscript 0 to indicate that these masses refer to the masses of the particular interaction channel we are considering .",
    "they are not necessarily equal to the masses @xmath99 and @xmath100 occurring in the time - ordered diagrams .",
    "for example , the potential for the @xmath101 contribution in the coupled - channel @xmath20 system has @xmath102 , but @xmath103 . in principle",
    ", the propagator in the static approximation can be handled exactly using the fact that  @xcite @xmath104 this integral needs to be evaluated numerically whenever @xmath105 , which can be a considerable time factor in practical calculations .",
    "we therefore make the same approximation as in ref .",
    "@xcite and use the fact that @xmath106 in most cases is rather close to half the sum of initial- and final - state baryon masses .",
    "the advantage of this , more crude , approximation is that the propagator can then be written as @xmath107 which means we have introduced an effective meson mass @xmath108 , where the mass has dropped to @xmath109 in our potentials we have included the decrease in the physical pion mass of 138.041 mev/@xmath110 to 132.58 mev/@xmath110 in @xmath111 , where @xmath112 can be @xmath10 , @xmath42 , or @xmath12 , and the much more significant decrease to 114.62 mev/@xmath110 in @xmath113 ; in all other cases , we retain the physical value of 138.041 mev/@xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath58 masses need to be reduced in all cases , where the drop in mass squared ranges from @xmath114 in @xmath115 to @xmath116 in @xmath117 . again , we argue that the scarce scattering data for the @xmath4 sector and the absence of any scattering data for the @xmath46 sectors at this point in time does not yet warrant the more sophisticated treatment of using eq .",

    "the coulomb interaction is included whenever the two scattering baryons are charged .",
    "we observe the general trend that for a particular value of the total strangeness , the change in scattering length from one model to the next in most cases nicely follows the change in @xmath24 ( which , in principle , labels each nsc97 model ) .",
    "the @xmath3 results of table  [ tabscat0 ] are included so as to present the complete set of allowed channels .",
    "here we also included the experimental values as found in refs .",
    "we clearly see that the present @xmath13 models only encompass the qualitative features of the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "it is well - known that the differences between the experimental singlet scattering lengths and effective ranges for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath120 can not be explained within a simple one - boson - exchange model ( one needs additional contributions from meson - mixing , two - pion exchange , pion - photon exchange , etc . ) and , indeed , for the nsc97 models presented here we also find that the @xmath50 @xmath121 and @xmath122 are almost the same as the @xmath120 ones . the difference with the @xmath49 ones are due to the inclusion of the coulomb interaction , of course .",
    "however , these differences between the experimental values are only of importance at low energies ( @xmath123 mev ) , where the accuracy of the experimental @xmath49 and @xmath50 scattering data magnifies this charge dependence  @xcite , and so the description of the scattering data above @xmath124 mev can still be very acceptable .    in table  [ tabscat-1 ]",
    "we repeat the @xmath4 results for the scattering lengths from our previous publication  @xcite , but here we also include the effective ranges .",

    "the large values for the triplet effective range @xmath134 in @xmath135 and @xmath136 are a simple reflection of the fact that the @xmath119 phase shift at small laboratory momenta is very small and only very slowly increases in magnitude .",
    "the @xmath119 phase shift for models nsc97a , nsc97b , and nsc97f starts off positive ( hence , negative @xmath137 ) , does not exceed @xmath138 at @xmath139 mev/@xmath91 , and then becomes negative at about 175 mev/@xmath91 .",

    "in this case , the large values for the singlet and triplet effective ranges in @xmath144 are a reflection of the fact that the presence of the coulomb interaction causes the @xmath48 and @xmath119 phase shifts to start off very flatly at 180@xmath145 . removing the coulomb interaction",
    "also removes the extreme flatness , as can be seen from the much more modest values for the effective ranges in @xmath146 .",
    "finally , the effective - range parameters for the @xmath45 sector are given in table  [ tabscat-4 ] . also in this case",
    ", the positive values for the singlet scattering lengths indicate bound states ; see the next subsection .      because the @xmath13 triplet scattering length is slightly off ( see table  [ tabscat0 ] )",
    ", it is not surprising that the nsc97 results for the deuteron are slightly off as well .",
    "the binding energies range from 2.19 mev for nsc97a to 2.07 mev for nsc97f , which is to be compared to the experimental deuteron binding energy of 2.224575(9 ) mev  @xcite . in view of these results",

    "they should not be used for any high - precision quantitative calculations , for which much more suitable potential models can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the presence or absence of bound states in the other interaction channels can best be understood in terms of the su(3 ) irreducible representations ( irreps ) to which the channel belongs , and the well - known fact that the @xmath13 interaction has a bound state in the @xmath119-@xmath148 coupled partial wave ( the deuteron ) and a quasi bound state in the @xmath48 partial wave .",
    "if an interaction belongs to the same irrep as the @xmath13 interaction , unbroken su(3 ) symmetry would imply that it also exhibits a bound state or quasi bound state .",

    "but it is possible that remnants of these ( quasi ) bound states can still appear or that quasi bound states turn into truly bound states .",

    "the presence of the coulomb interaction in @xmath144 causes a shift of roughly 1 mev , resulting in binding energies of 2.30 mev for nsc97a to 15.6 mev for nsc97f .    finally , the attraction in @xmath18 is also strong enough to support a bound state .",
    "the @xmath155 and @xmath156 give almost identical results ranging from 0.10 mev for nsc97a to 15.8 mev for nsc97f .",
    "again , the presence of the coulomb interaction in @xmath157 causes a shift of about 1 mev , and so the nsc97a model no longer supports a bound state in this channel .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath149 @xmath119-@xmath148 interactions both belong to the @xmath158 irrep , and so , in analogy with the deuteron bound state in @xmath13 , we also expect bound states in @xmath149 .",
    "indeed , in @xmath146 the binding energies range from 5.64 mev for nsc97a to 36.1 mev for nsc97f , whereas in @xmath144 they range from 4.86 mev for nsc97a to 35.3 mev for nsc97f .",
    "the fact that the nucleons and cascades both form isodoublets might suggest that the @xmath13 and @xmath18 interactions are very similar .",
    "although this is true for the @xmath159 partial waves ( both interactions belong to the @xmath150 irrep ) , this is not the case for the @xmath160 partial waves . in table",
    "[ tabirrep ] we see that the @xmath160 @xmath13 interaction belongs to the @xmath158 irrep , while the @xmath160 @xmath18 interaction belongs to the @xmath161 irrep .",
    "the @xmath158 supports a bound state ( the deuteron ) , but apparently the @xmath161 does not , as can be deduced from the fact that a bound state in the @xmath119-@xmath148 @xmath153 or @xmath154 channel has never been found .",
    "this explains why here we also do not find a bound state in @xmath156 : there is no deuteron - analogue in @xmath18 .",
    "an analysis on the presence or absence of bound states in all the other interaction channels is much more difficult .",
    "the reason , of course , is that none of these remaining interactions belongs to one single irrep .",
    "hence , it is possible that the presence of one particular irrep might provide enough attraction to support a bound state , but that the presence of another irrep reduces this attraction and prevents the existence of a bound state .",
    "the analysis is further complicated by the fact that these other interactions ( on the particle basis ) do not belong to pure isospin states , and so there is an additional mixing of contributions form different irreps .",
    "therefore , we here do not attempt to analyze these channels and simply suffice by stating that we do not find @xmath30-wave bound states in any of them .",
    "we next present the predictions for the total cross section for all @xmath70 channels . whenever a coupling to different channels is involved (",
    "i.e. , for the @xmath25 , @xmath20 , @xmath16 , and @xmath162 interactions ) , we only show the result for the leading channel . for those cases where",
    "both baryons are charged , we do not include the purely coulomb contribution to the total cross section , but we do include the coulomb interference to the nuclear amplitude .",
    "the cross section is calculated by summing the contributions from partial waves with orbital angular momentum up to and including @xmath163 .",
    "we find this to be sufficient for all the @xmath164 sectors ; inclusion of any higher partial waves has no significant effect . in the case of @xmath13 scattering ( @xmath3 )",
    "we go up to @xmath165 , which is high enough to capture the general energy dependence of the @xmath13 total cross section .",
    "inclusion of higher partial waves will shift the total cross section to slightly higher values without changing the overall shape .",
    "of course , their inclusion would be necessary if a detailed comparison with real experimental data were to be made .    in fig .",
    "[ fignnsgt](a ) we give the @xmath120 , @xmath50 , and purely nuclear @xmath49 total cross sections for model nsc97a .",
    "the curves for the other five models nsc97b  f are indistinguishable on this scale , and are therefore left out .",
    "this similarity is a reflection of the fact that all six models give an equally good description of the @xmath3 sector .",
    "the purely nuclear @xmath49 and @xmath120 results are also almost identical which is a consequence of the fact that the nsc97 @xmath13 models do not contain any explicit charge - symmetry breaking , and so any difference is totally due to the neutron - proton mass difference , which is very small .",
    "all three cross sections look very similar , but at @xmath166 mev the @xmath50 cross section of @xmath16739 mb is slightly lower than the @xmath120 and @xmath49 cross sections of @xmath16751 mb .",
    "below @xmath168 mev the @xmath50 cross section becomes larger , while at very small laboratory kinetic energies ( not visible in this figure ) the @xmath120 and @xmath49 cross sections rapidly exceed the @xmath50 cross section again by more than a factor of two .",
    "[ fignnsgt](b ) we also give the @xmath49 result where we include the modification due to the coulomb - nuclear interference . in order to illustrate the fact that this interference cross section vanishes as the laboratory kinetic energy approaches zero",
    ", we have included a subplot where we have expanded the 01 mev region .    in fig .",
    "[ figynsgt ] we give the @xmath154 , @xmath153 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 total cross sections .",
    "the purely nuclear @xmath153 total cross section is very similar to the @xmath154 one , and so here we only give the @xmath153 cross section including the coulomb - nuclear interference modification .",
    "note that for the @xmath4 sector ( and all other @xmath164 sectors to be presented below ) , the total cross section is given as a function of laboratory momentum @xmath69 , rather than of laboratory kinetic energy @xmath171 .",
    "the reason is that experimental data for @xmath13 scattering are usually given at a certain @xmath171 , whereas for @xmath14 scattering they are usually given at a certain @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath169 and @xmath170 total cross sections show a cusp effect when the @xmath172 and @xmath173 thresholds open up .",
    "the cusp is due to the enhancement in the @xmath119 waves , which is caused by the coupling of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels and the rather strong interaction in the @xmath119-wave @xmath26 channel .",
    "for @xmath170 we also observe a small bump when the threshold to @xmath174 opens up .",
    "again we note that the curves for the six nsc97 models are very close to each other , which reflects the fact that these models all describe the ( scarce ) @xmath14 scattering data equally well  @xcite .",
    "the spread in the curves at low momenta corresponds to a similar spread in the scattering lengths ; see table  [ tabscat-1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figxnsgt ] we present the @xmath20 , @xmath136 and @xmath135 , and @xmath142 total cross sections ; the latter for both the purely nuclear case and the case including the coulomb - nuclear interference modification .",
    "the two corresponding @xmath143 total cross sections are left out , since they are almost exactly the same as the @xmath142 ones . here ,",
    "for the first time , the differences between the six models clearly manifest themselves .",
    "the value for the @xmath20 total cross section at small momenta varies by almost a factor of four , while at high momenta there is also a variation of at least a factor of two .",
    "it is interesting that only nsc97e exhibits a smoothed - out cusp effect when the two @xmath175 thresholds open up , whereas the other models exhibit no such enhancement .",
    "the six nsc97 results for the two @xmath16 total cross sections are all very similar up to laboratory momenta close to 590 mev/@xmath91 , where the thresholds to @xmath176 or @xmath177 open up .",
    "all models exhibit a clear cusp effect , nsc97f being the most pronounced .",
    "we also observe a cusp effect due to the opening up of the @xmath178 and @xmath179 channels , but for models nsc97e and nsc97f this effect is shifted to laboratory momenta lower than the actual threshold value ( about 970 mev/@xmath91 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the transition potential has enough attraction to cause a virtual bound state , which manifests itself as a multichannel resonance , rather than a cusp .",
    "the nsc97 results for the @xmath101 total cross sections show some variation at low momenta , while for @xmath180 mev/@xmath91 all six models give very similar results .",
    "the variation at low momenta could already be inferred from inspecting the @xmath101 @xmath48 scattering lengths in table  [ tabscat-2 ] : here the models show a substantial variation as well .",
    "the total cross sections for @xmath146 and @xmath144 , and for @xmath181 and @xmath182 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figxysgt ] .",
    "the @xmath149 and @xmath162 total cross sections are found to be rather similar to the @xmath26 and @xmath25 total cross sections , at least as far as the general energy dependence is concerned .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for high laboratory momenta the @xmath162 total cross sections are roughly of the same magnitude as the @xmath25 ones .",
    "these similarities can be understood from the fact that both nucleons and cascades form isospin doublets , and so the @xmath4 and @xmath56 interactions belong to the same set of su(3 ) irreps ; see table  [ tabirrep ] .",
    "the only difference is an interchange of @xmath161 and @xmath158 .",
    "this might also be the reason why there is no cusp effect in the @xmath162 cross section ( at the threshold momentum of 690 mev/@xmath91 ) : the isospin-1/2 ( @xmath183 ) interaction involves the @xmath158 irrep , to which also the deuteron belongs , whereas the isospin-1/2 ( @xmath184 ) interaction involves the @xmath161 irrep .",
    "the small bump in the nsc97c cross section is then probably due to the fact that the coupling to the isospin-3/2 @xmath149 interaction ( which belongs to the @xmath158 irrep ) in this case is strong enough to cause an enhancement .",
    "a further difference is that the @xmath162 and @xmath149 results exhibit much more variation from one model to the next as do the @xmath25 and @xmath26 results .    finally , the total cross sections for @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 are given in fig .",
    "[ figxxsgt ] . for @xmath157",
    "we give both the purely nuclear cross section ( c ) and the one including the coulomb - nuclear interference modification ( d ) .",
    "as expected , the results are similar to the @xmath13 results , but again the differences between the six nsc97 models are much more pronounced . the nsc97a result for the total cross sections",
    "is found to be very large , as was to be expected in view of the large @xmath48 scattering length , given in table  [ tabscat-4 ] .",
    "as already stated in our previous publication  @xcite , the nsc97 potentials presented here are an important step forward in modeling the baryon - baryon interactions for scattering and hypernuclei in the context of broken su(3)@xmath185 symmetry .",
    "the potentials are based on the one - boson - exchange model , where the coupling constants at the baryon - baryon - meson vertices are restricted by the broken su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "each type of meson exchange ( pseudoscalar , vector , scalar ) contains five free parameters : a singlet coupling constant , an octet coupling constant , the @xmath23 ratio @xmath186 , a meson - mixing angle , and a parameter @xmath187 which effectively accounts for the fact that the strange quark is much heavier than the up and down quarks .",
    "however , they are not all treated as free parameters : the pseudoscalar and vector @xmath23 parameters and meson - mixing angles are fixed from other sources  @xcite .",
    "the potentials are regularized with exponential cutoff parameters , which provide a few additional free parameters .",
    "most of these parameters are fixed in the fit to the wealth of accurate @xmath13 scattering data , while the remaining ones are fixed in the fit to the ( few ) @xmath14 scattering data .",
    "here we note that , although the scattering data for the @xmath14 sector are very scarce , they are extremely valuable in constraining @xmath14 potential models . as a matter of fact , it is not at all trivial to obtain a good fit to the @xmath14 data and at the same time avoid ( experimentally unobserved ) bound states in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels .",
    "however , there is still enough freedom to construct six different models , nsc97a through nsc97f .",
    "they all describe the @xmath13 and @xmath14 data equally well , but differ on a more detailed level .",
    "the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry then allows us to extend these models to the higher strangeness channels ( i.e. , @xmath15 and all interactions involving cascades ) , without the need to introduce additional free parameters .",
    "the nsc97 models are the first potential models of this kind .    in order to illustrate the basic properties of these potentials ,",
    "we have presented results for scattering lengths , possible bound states in @xmath30-waves , and total cross sections .",
    "the results for the six different models are rather similar for the @xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath14 ) sectors , but then each model was fitted such as to ensure equally good descriptions of the data .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath118 sectors can be viewed as extrapolations and , indeed , those results show much more variation from one model to the next .",
    "it would , therefore , be very worthwhile to have experimental information on the interactions in these @xmath118 sectors to further constrain the potentials , and to test the su(3)-symmetry assumptions that have been made .",
    "information from hypernuclear data assumes knowledge of how to treat many - body effects , and so two - body scattering data would be preferred .",
    "however , we realize , of course , that hyperons and cascades are short - lived and hard to produce in large quantities , which makes it very difficult indeed to set up a good scattering experiment .",
    "armed with the fact that we know that the @xmath13 @xmath48 interaction , belonging to the @xmath150 irrep , is attractive enough to form a quasi bound state , and that the @xmath13 @xmath119-@xmath148 interaction , belonging to the @xmath158 irrep , causes the deuteron bound state , we can understand the presence of bound states in some of the other channels by virtue of the fact whether the corresponding interaction involves the @xmath150 or @xmath158 irrep , or not .",
    "this is an interesting observation , because our potentials do not obey a perfect su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "first of all , we use the physical baryon masses which are substantially different from the su(3 ) average .",
    "second , the cutoff parameters which regularize the vertices are not dictated by to what irrep a particular interaction belongs  @xcite , but rather by what meson is being exchanged ; for more details , see ref .",
    "finally , for each type of meson exchange , we have introduced a parameter @xmath187 which explicitly breaks the su(3 ) symmetry ( in some models up to 20% ) ; see above and ref .",
    "@xcite . in spite of these modifications ,",
    "our results show that the general features of an exact su(3 ) symmetry survive to a remarkable degree . again",
    ", experimental information on the @xmath118 systems will be invaluable as a test of these results .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that these nsc97 potentials provide an excellent starting point for calculations on multi - strange systems . unlike other approaches , these are the first models for which the @xmath118 interactions contain no free parameters , and for which the @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions are fitted to the two - body scattering data .",
    "they can be used to calculate properties of hypernuclei ( including double-@xmath19 or even more exotic hypernuclei ) and to explore strange nuclear matter .",
