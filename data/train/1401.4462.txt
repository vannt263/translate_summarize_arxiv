    "galaxies are known to contain both luminous and dark matter ( dm ) . in particular , dm haloes provide the seeds of galaxy formation , as baryons cool and fall towards the centres of dm overdensities in protoclusters , resulting eventually in the luminous , directly observable components . once gas is converted into stars , the assembly of central objects proceeds via mergers @xcite .",
    "cosmological dm - only simulations offer predictions as to the shape , density profile and typical mass of dm haloes @xcite .",
    "however , the buildup of baryonic matter affects the dm haloes in which they assemble , through gravitational interaction between the luminous and dark component .",
    "when baryonic effects are included in the simulations , these can transfer energy between the luminous and dark components and alter the dm profile through different channels @xcite .",
    "in particular , in elliptical galaxies baryonic feedback @xcite and virialisation of the infalling material @xcite can produce a shallower density profile , whereas a slow mass build - up tends to steepen it @xcite .",
    "when the assembly of central objects is studied with higher - resolution and smaller - scale simulations , a set of prescriptions must be adopted to quantify the importance of baryonic feedback , amount of substructure and merging rates .",
    "these yield distinctive signatures on the final state , in terms of size and mass of the stellar component as well as dm content and density profile @xcite .",
    "then , investigating the dm profiles of observed galaxies provides tests of galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "the task is simpler for late - type galaxies , in which the orbits of the stars are generally near - circular . in early - type galaxies ,",
    "the role of the mass profile in the observed kinematics is degenerate with the orbital distribution of stars .",
    "this is commonly known as the _ mass - anisotropy degeneracy _ , and constitutes the main obstacle to robust conclusions on the dynamics of elliptical galaxies .",
    "equivalently , only the projected observables ( surface brightness and line - of - sight velocities ) are available , whereas the dynamics of these systems is characterized by the deprojected , three - dimensional densities and velocities .",
    "the investigation of dm in elliptical galaxies usually relies on techniques that construct three - dimensional models and compare their projected properties to the observational data .",
    "this approach is traditionally implemented via the jeans equations governing the velocity moments of the distribution function , adopting or relaxing the approximation of spherical symmetry @xcite .",

    "then , a theoretical framework that naturally encodes aperture - averaging would put the stress on the adopted physical model , rather than on the numerical details that are inherent in , for example , orbit - based descriptions . within the jeans formalism in spherical",

    "@xcite provided expressions of @xmath7 in terms of single integrals of mass profile and luminosity density , for a set of simple anisotropy models .",
    "@xcite reduced the expressions for aperture - averaged velocity dispersions from triple integrals ( usually shown in the literature ) to single ones in the isotropic case . here , we develop an approach that operates just within the direct observables , in particular the surface brightness profile rather than the luminosity density .",
    "this has already been studied by @xcite in the context of gravitational lensing by early - type galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we extend our earlier formalism to include the role of anisotropy explicitly within different models .",
    "in section 2 , we present new formulae for line of sight and aperture - averaged velocity dispersions . within",
    "the approach followed here , there is no need to perform any explicit or approximate deprojection .",
    "section 3 provides simple explicit results , for scale - free densities or modest anisotropy and/or large radii .",
    "we compare our findings to empirical aperture corrections that are commonly used elsewhere .",
    "we show that some structural properties ( such as kinematic profiles and typical masses , figs  [ fig : sapcapp ] and  [ fig : mestreff ] ) of early - type galaxies can be understood by means of simple models , perhaps even deceptively simple ! in section 4 , we present different mass estimators based on our formalism and we characterise the possible sources of error .",
    "we sum up our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the methods illustrated below are particularly useful in the presence of noisy data ( e.g. paper ii in this series ) or poor spatial resolution of the measured kinematics .",

    "models with @xmath46 have a falling rotation curve and a declining velocity dispersion at all radii . when @xmath47 the velocity dispersion increases at small radii and decreases slowly at large radii .",
    "the transition between these two behaviours happens around @xmath48 ( i.e. a flat rotation curve ) , although the velocity dispersion profile is not exactly flat .",
    "the exact value of the transition exponent , where @xmath49 is almost uniform , varies depending on the structural properties ( e.g. srsic index and anisotropy ) .",
    "more important than the shape of single velocity dispersion profiles is the existence , for each chosen anisotropy , of a _ pinch radius _",

    "this location changes with anisotropy @xmath27 ( c.f .",
    ", fig.[fig : vdispr ] ) and with the srsic index .",
    "in particular , steeper profiles ( lower srsic indices ) produce a smaller variation in @xmath50 with @xmath51 this fact can be justified in the light of asymptotic behaviours at small @xmath27 or large radii , which are discussed in section [ sec : spec ] ; we will exploit that in section [ sect : makinpr ] to construct a family of mass estimators .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath18 with the effective radius is controlled essentially by the circular velocity .",
    "if @xmath1 is increased , the overall normalisation decreases for @xmath46 ( as @xmath52 ) and increases for @xmath53 this means that , for a rising ( declining ) circular velocity curve , increasing the effective radius will increase ( decrease ) the overall magnitude of the velocity dispersion at fixed @xmath54 this phenomenon is clear within scale - free total densities and uniform anisotropy because , in this case , the only available lengthscale is @xmath1 and so we can expect @xmath55 to be modulated by @xmath56 ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * who give the exact solutions for scale - free tracers in scale - free total densities ) .",
    "more elaborate mass models , exhibiting different power - law regimes in different regions , can be understood in terms of the kinematic profiles shown here .",
    "for example , a navarro - frenk - white density @xmath57 produces a line of sight dispersion profile that is approximated by the one with @xmath58 at small radii and @xmath59 at large radii , provided @xmath21 declines fast enough with @xmath60 however , in most cases , eq .",

    "then , the quantity to be compared to observations is the radial average @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the projected luminosity within @xmath60 averages within radial annuli or slits can be derived from these formulae by means of straightforward manipulations .",
    "the triple integrals can be rearranged to express the aperture - averaged velocity dispersion as a sum of three terms ( see appendix a ) @xmath63 where we have used the shorthand @xmath64 the first line gives the virial limit , the second one provides aperture corrections for @xmath34 , while the third one expands to the case of anisotropy @xmath35 .",
    "without the third line , this equation is equivalent to the isotropic results of @xcite . for computational purposes , it is useful to replace the stellar density @xmath10 in eq .",

    "the first is the mass model : as expected , higher masses correspond to higher velocity dispersions at fixed effective radius @xmath67 the second is the anisotropy , which enters only in the last term of eq  ( [ eq : apsigma ] ) and whose effect on the velocity dispersion has the same sign as @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the uncertainties on the mass modelling due to observational errors on the measured velocity dispersions can be decoupled from the systematic uncertainties that are encoded in @xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the same remarks hold here for the overall mass normalisation and behaviour with @xmath44    fig .  [",
    "fig : sapcapp ] shows the behaviour of aperture - averaged velocity dispersions @xmath66 scaled to the values at @xmath68 in two cases  namely , an osipkov - merritt profile with @xmath69 and an isotropic model with @xmath34 everywhere .",
    "the choice of @xmath70 is used solely to make comparisons with other work @xcite more immediate .    in general , models with @xmath71",

    "this small modulation of @xmath78 with anisotropy suggests that , over lengthscales that are comparable to the effective radius , nearby elliptical galaxies show weak homology  in the sense that their dynamical properties are consistent with a total density scaling like @xmath79 and just modest radial anisotropy .",
    "however , the median behaviour at radii @xmath80 is not necessarily indicative of the density profile of single systems , especially over larger lengthscales .",
    "analysis of the hot x - ray gas in early - type galaxies by @xcite supports the approximation of a scale - free total mass profile out to large radii , but the relative exponent varies appreciably over their sample .",
    "@xcite studied the density exponent @xmath78 in 58 galaxies in the slacs sample @xcite .",
    "the typical density exponent from gravitational lensing , estimated by means of global scaling relations over the whole sample , is in the interval @xmath81 on the other hand , on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis the most likely density exponents occupy a much wider range , with larger intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath78 in individual galaxies and the mean exponent @xmath82 derived by scaling relations over the whole sample are not directly related to one another .",
    "then , considerable care should be taken when the dynamics of individual galaxies is studied , as to avoid the _ ecological fallacy _ of exporting ensemble correlations at the individual level .",
    "if the dm content at large radii is studied , simple analyses enforcing @xmath83 may bias the inferred dm masses , automatically favouring the values resulting from a flat rotation curve .    the kinematic and photometric properties of individual galaxies can deviate appreciably from the simple , average behaviour illustrated above .",
    "in fact , the collection of profiles shown in @xcite , if interpreted in terms of the models shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sapcapp ] , spans the whole range @xmath84 and @xmath85 in general , there is no guarantee that individual systems are isotropic or that @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , the morphology of individual galaxies can vary within the srsic family of profiles  @xcite @xmath87\\ , \\label{eq : sers}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is defined such that @xmath1 encloses half of the total luminosity .",
    "a convenient expression of @xmath89 in @xmath90 has been provided by @xcite .",
    "the light profiles of some elliptical galaxies can be better fitted by srsic models with an index substantially different from the de vaucouleurs value @xmath91 that said , the assumption of weak homology can be taken as a first approximation to infer properties of the mass profile within @xmath92 before more detailed analyses are undertaken .",
    "a convenient aspect of the jeans formalism is that eqs ( [ eq : inte ] ) and ( [ eq : proj ] ) involve information only from radii larger than the upper limits of integration ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , if the stellar density decays fast enough ( which is always the case for elliptical galaxies in practice ) , the dominant contribution to the integrals is from radii just slightly greater than the lower extremes of integration .",
    "this turns out to be useful in practice when handling the effects of anisotropy , since we just need to consider the anisotropy profile and the mass @xmath32 near the radii of interest .",

    "this formula is given by @xcite , who also found complementary results for completely radial ( @xmath246 ) or tangential ( @xmath247 ) orbits , still adopting @xmath248    when @xmath249 and @xmath27 is small , a de vaucouleurs surface brightness leads to @xmath250 in this case , the enclosed mass at radii @xmath251 can be estimated by replacing @xmath212 with @xmath252 and @xmath158 with @xmath1 in equation ( [ eq : globest ] ) , provided the proportionality coefficient is adjusted to @xmath253 .",
    "the mass from the finite - aperture sweetspot ( fig .",

    "the ratio @xmath255 between circular velocity and average second moment within an aperture - radius @xmath245 depends weakly on @xmath256 as long as this is around unity .",
    "then , a formula with @xmath257 and @xmath258 is the simplest to use for early - type galaxies with stellar velocity dispersion data largely confined to within one or two effective radii , when the srsic index is close to @xmath259      weak homology arguments are probably appropriate for nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "[ fig : mestreff ] shows the ratio @xmath260 $ ] for srsic luminous components , as a function of the srsic index @xmath90 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : finap ] ) and @xmath261 the dynamical analysis of early - type galaxies by @xcite is summarised here by the open symbols .",
    "regardless of the adequacy of the single srsic fit to the photometric profile , which is indicated by different symbols , a trend of @xmath262 with the best - fitting srsic index @xmath90 is apparent .",
    "if the mass inference is robust around @xmath234 we can interpret this behaviour via models with different anisotropy or power - law index .",
    "in particular , galaxies with lower ( higher ) @xmath90 have stars on slightly tangential ( radial ) orbits on average .",
    "as shown in @xcite , nearby early - type galaxies typically consist of bulge and disk components with variable size and luminosity - ratios . if the bulge ( or the disk ) dominates the photometric profile , that will drive the best - fitting srsic index towards higher ( or lower ) values . then , at least part of the trend illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mestreff ] can be simply understood as a variation of bulge - to - disk ratio , with disks ( bulges ) having more stars on circular ( radial ) orbits .",
    "recently , @xcite have cautioned against the approximation of weak homology when compact massive galaxies , especially at higher redshift , are examined . in their analysis , they find that dynamical masses estimated as in cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2013 ) imply negative dm fractions .",

    "since the mass within @xmath1 is given by at least the luminous component , we can consider @xmath263 $ ] as a lower bound on @xmath264 and check how that compares with the behaviour of nearby ellipticals .",
    "the analysis in @xcite relies on stacked spectra to obtain velocity dispersions and stellar masses , assuming a salpeter imf , in different redshift bins . at first sight ,",
    "their results seem hard to reconcile with diverse homology arguments @xcite , or lensing results @xcite . however , the velocity dispersion should be averaged within the effective radius , in order to operate a fair comparison . when the simple correction @xmath265 is made ( c.f .",
    "section 2.3 ) , most of the objects fall back into the range spanned by weak homology .",
    "this is merely a consistency check , since applying the same kind of aperture correction to each galaxy tacitly assumes some kind of homology across the sample .",
    "the discrepancy is still present for the most compact ones , which may then be interpreted as a set of fast rotators .",
    "spatially resolved kinematic information will tell if this is the case .",
    "also , the choice of imf may play a role .",
    "when dynamical masses are inferred via gravitational lensing , then a ( universal ) salpeter imf implies negative dm fractions for some of the slacs galaxies  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is evidence to suggest a dichotomy in early - type galaxies .",
    "slow rotators show a tendency towards a salpeter imf , and fast rotators towards a chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "moreover , the imf is known to vary with velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the problem indicated by @xcite may be that both a non - universal imf and more detailed kinematic information are required when dealing with compact massive galaxies at higher redshift , although part of the tension is already alleviated when aperture corrections are included .",
    "we have shown how , under the approximation of spherical symmetry , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion can be computed by means of quadratures involving the surface brightness profile @xmath21 and a kernel that depends on the mass model and on the anisotropy .",
    "this avoids the need for explicit de - projection of the surface brightness to give the luminosity density , subsequent solution of the jeans equations and final re - projection to give the line of sight dispersion .",
    "we have provided simple approximations for the kinematics at large distances or mild anisotropy .",
    "the results on kinematic profiles can be adapted to include the process of averaging through circular apertures of varying size .",
    "results for other cases ( long - slit measurements , averages through an annulus , point - spread - function blurring ) can be obtained by simple combinations of the ones for a circular aperture .",
    "the aperture - averaged velocity dispersion can be computed by means of single integral over the stellar density profile modulated by a kernel encoding the dependence on mass and anisotropy . if the surface brightness @xmath21 is used , the quadratures are ( at worst ) double integrals and the kernels can be re - written as combinations of special functions .",
    "for some special cases ( including constant anisotropy with @xmath266 and scale - free total densities ) , the kernel can be written explicitly in terms of elementary functions .",
    "the aperture - averaged kinematic profiles for a de vaucouleurs luminous component in scale - free total densities ( @xmath267 ) reproduce the empirical behaviour observed in over 25 early - types in the sauron survey  @xcite , provided the density exponent is @xmath268 and anisotropy at the effective radius is mild ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "this result agrees with the findings of @xcite , which are based on the analysis of 58 lensing galaxies in the slacs sample @xcite .",
    "at least as regards bulk properties , elliptical galaxies are seemingly well - represented by the simple isotropic models with a flat rotation curve .",
    "mass estimators can be derived by examining the kinematic profiles or aperture - averaged velocity dispersions . when the surface brightness @xmath21 is measured with sufficient accuracy ,",
    "one strategy is to determine the location @xmath158 within which the enclosed mass is best constrained and the radius @xmath50 at which kinematics should be measured in order to produce the tightest mass estimate . in the more common case of aperture - averaged kinematics , we have not found simple estimators for a de vaucouleurs profile in scale - free total density that are truly robust against changes in anisotropy , except in the large aperture or virial limit .    for extended tracers in the outer parts of elliptical galaxies , such as globular clusters or planetary nebulae , the velocity dispersion averaged over a large aperture is in principle measurable .",
    "so , eq .  ( [ eq : globest ] ) provides a simple estimate of the mass enclosed at a radius @xmath158 that , for a de vaucouleurs profile , is near to the effective radius .",
    "more commonly , the kinematical information is available only for populations within an effective radius or so",
    ". then we advocate using @xmath270 as the simplest mass - estimator in the absence of more detailed information , provided the photometric profile is bulge - dominated ( that is , has a sersic index @xmath271 ) .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the estimator of cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2013 ) , namely that the mass enclosed near the half - light radius is @xmath272 even if we have derived the result under completely different and more general hypotheses .",
