    "the skyrme - faddeev model is an example of a field theory that supports the finite - energy knotted solitons .",
    "the significance of this model has increased noticeably when it has been conjectured that the model can be seen as a low - energy effective classical model of the underlying yang - mills theory @xcite . similarly to many other models @xcite the classical soliton solutions of the skyrme - faddeev model can play a role of adequate normal models useful in description of the strong coupling sector of the yang - mills theory .",
    "the exact soliton ( vortex ) solution of the model has been found within the integrable sector @xcite .",
    "such a sector exists in the version of the model that is an extension of the standard skyrme - faddeev model obtained by including some quartic term different to the skyrme term .",
    "the study of the extended models have been originally motivated by the results of the analysis of the wilsonian action of the @xmath1 yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that also in the case of the complex projective target space @xmath0 the extended skyrme - faddeev model ( in which it has been imposed some special constraints for the parameters of the model ) possesses an exact soliton solutions in the integrable sector @xcite .",
    "it has not been clear until now if the presence of the solutions in the considered model is related to the particular choice of the coupling constants like in the case of the exact solution or it is rather a general property of the model . in order to answer this question one needs to construct some other solutions than the exact ones .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the existence of the solutions of the model inside / outside the integrable sector , especially in absence of some particular relations between coupling constants .",
    "we show that such solutions exist .",
    "the key role is playing by the potential which usually work as a stabilizer for the solution . in the present paper",
    "the potential appears in the context of exact holomorphic solutions , as it was presented in the case of @xmath2 related model  @xcite , and also for solutions from a non - holomorphic sector .",
    "we conclude that the exact solution appears as a particular solution belonging to the wider class of solutions of the model .",
    "the study of such models is promising and could be important for understanding some aspects of the strong coupling sector of the yang - mills theory .",
    "the skyrme - faddeev model and its extensions on the @xmath2 target space are usually expressed in terms of the real unit vector @xmath3 .",
    "the dimension of a target space is simply related to the number of degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "for instance , the model with the @xmath2 target space has only two independent degrees of freedom . in order to add more degrees of freedom one can consider some higher dimensional target spaces . the target space ( coset space ) in the case of some higher dimensional @xmath4 lie groups , i.e. @xmath5",
    ", can be chosen in several nonequivalent ways .",
    "recently it has been proposed some formulation of the extended skyrme - faddeev model on the @xmath0 target space @xcite .",

    "the quartic term proportional to @xmath18 is the skyrme term whereas other quartic terms constitute the extension of the standard skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "the novelty of the model ( [ actionx ] ) comparing with that introduced in @xcite is the presence of the potential @xmath22 . in recent studies ,",
    "several potentials have been introduced for the planar skyrme - type model  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the extended @xmath2 skyrme - faddeev model in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions possesses some non - holomorphic solutions that do not belong to the integrable sector @xcite . since the extended skyrme - faddeev model on the @xmath0 target space also possesses the integrable sector as well as the exact vortex solutions the natural question is if there exist any solutions that do not belong to the integrable sector ? in similarity to the paper @xcite we study such a possibility in the presence of the potential . as it has been explained below such solutions",
    "can be obtained numerically for some choice of the potential .",
