    "generators using radiation from an electron beam in a periodic slow - wave circuit ( travelling wave tubes , backward wave oscillators , free electron lasers ) are now widespread @xcite .",
    "diffraction radiation @xcite in periodical structures is in the basis of operation of travelling wave tubes ( twt ) @xcite , backward wave oscillators ( bwo ) and such devices as smith - purcell lasers @xcite and volume fels using two- or three - dimensional distributed feedback @xcite .",
    "analysis shows that during operation of such devices electrons lose their energy for radiation , therefore , the electron beam slows down and gets out of synchronism with the radiating wave .",
    "these limits the efficiency of generator , which usually does not exceed @xmath0 .    in the first years after creation of travelling wave tube",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that to retain synchronism between the electron beam and electromagnetic wave in a twt change of the wave phase velocity should be provided .",
    "application of systems with variable parameters in microwave devices allows significant increase of efficiency of such devices @xcite .",
    "the same methods for efficiency increase are widely used for undulator fels @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider generation process in smith - purcell fels , volume fels , travelling wave tubes and backward wave oscillators using photonic crystal built from metal threads @xcite .",
    "it is shown that applying diffraction gratings ( photonic crystal ) with the variable period one can significantly increase radiation output .",
    "it is also shown that diffraction gratings ( photonic crystal ) can be used for creation of the dynamical wiggler with variable period in the system .",
    "this makes possible to develop double - cascaded fel with variable parameters changing , which efficiency can be significantly higher that of conventional system .",
    "in general case the equations , which describe lasing process , follow from the maxwell equations : @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the current and charge densities , the electromagnetic induction @xmath6 and , therefore , @xmath7 , the indices @xmath8 correspond to the axes @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the current and charge densities are respectively defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electron charge , @xmath12 is the velocity of the particle @xmath13 ( @xmath13 numerates the beam particles ) , @xmath14-   \\frac{\\vec{v}_{\\alpha}}{c^2}(\\vec{v}_{\\alpha}(t)\\vec{e}(\\vec{r}_{\\alpha}(t),t ) ) \\right\\},\\label{sys1}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the lorentz - factor , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the electric ( magnetic ) field in the point of location @xmath18 of the particle @xmath13 .",
    "it should be reminded that the equation ( [ sys1 ] ) can also be written as @xcite : @xmath19 \\right\\},\\label{sys11}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the particle momentum .    combining the equations in ( [ sys0 ] ) we obtain : @xmath21",
    "the dielectric permittivity tensor can be expressed as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the dielectric susceptibility . when @xmath24 the equation ( [ sys01 ] ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath25    when the grating is ideal @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "let the diffraction grating ( photonic crystal ) period is smoothly varied with distance , which is much greater then the diffraction grating ( ptotonic crystal lattice ) period .",
    "it is convenient in this case to present the susceptibility @xmath23 in the form , typical for theory of x - ray diffraction in crystals with lattice distortion @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the reciprocal lattice vector in the vicinity of the point @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to the theory of x - rays diffraction , in the case under consideration @xmath32 depends on @xmath33 . it is to the fact that @xmath32 depends on the volume of the lattice unit cell @xmath34 , which can be significantly varied for diffraction gratings ( photonic crystals ) , as distinct from natural crystals .",
    "the volume of the unit cell @xmath35 depends on coordinate and , for example , for a cubic lattice it is determined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the lattice periods . if @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath33 , the expression ( [ chi01 ] ) converts to that usually used for x - rays in crystals with lattice distortion @xcite .",
    "it should be reminded that for an ideal crystal without lattice distortions , the wave , which propagates in crystal can be presented as a superposition of the plane waves : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "let us use now that in the case under consideration the typical length for change of the lattice parameters significantly exceeds lattice period .",
    "this provides to express the field inside the crystal with lattice distortion similarly ( [ field ] ) , but with @xmath41 depending on @xmath33 and @xmath42 and noticeably changing at the distances much greater than the lattice period .",
    "similarly , the wave vector should be considered as a slowly changing function of coordinate .    according to the above",
    "let us find the solution of ( [ 1 ] ) in the form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , where @xmath45 can be found as solution of the dispersion equation in the vicinity of the point with the coordinate vector @xmath33 , integration is done over the quasiclassical trajectory , which describes motion of the wavepacket in the crystal with lattice distortion .",
    "let us consider now case when all the waves participating in the diffraction process lays in a plane ( coupled wave diffraction , multiple - wave diffraction ) i.e. all the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath27 lie in one plane @xcite .",
    "suppose the wave polarization vector is orthogonal to the plane of diffraction .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ * ] ) in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48    then multiplying ( [ 1 ] ) by @xmath49 one can get : @xmath50 applying the equality @xmath51 and using ( [ * 1 ] ) we obtain @xmath52 , \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , substitution the above to ( [ 2 ] ) gives the following system : @xmath53 + \\nonumber \\\\ % & & + \\textrm{~conjugated~terms~ } % = 4 \\pi \\vec{e } \\left ( \\frac{1}{c^2 } \\frac{\\partial \\vec{j}(\\vec{r},t)}{\\partial t } + \\vec{\\nabla } \\rho ( \\vec{r},t ) \\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\frac{1}{2 } e^{i(\\phi_{2 } ( \\vec{r})-\\omega t ) } [ 2i \\vec{k}_2(\\vec{r } ) \\vec{\\nabla } a_2 + i \\vec{\\nabla } \\vec{k}_2 ( \\vec{r } ) a_2   - k_2 ^ 2(\\vec{r } ) a_2 + \\nonumber \\\\ % & & + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 } \\varepsilon_0(\\omega,\\vec{r } ) a_2 + i",

    "note here that for numerical analysis of ( [ 3 ] ) , if @xmath58 , it is convenient to take the vector @xmath59 in the form @xmath60 .    for better understanding let us suppose that the diffraction grating ( photonic crystal lattice ) period changes along one direction and define this direction as axis @xmath61 .    thus , for one - dimensional case , when @xmath62 the system ( [ 3 ] ) converts to the following : @xmath63 + \\nonumber \\\\ % & & + \\textrm{~conjugated~terms~ } % = 4 \\pi \\vec{e } \\left ( \\frac{1}{c^2 } \\frac{\\partial \\vec{j}(\\vec{r},t)}{\\partial t } + \\vec{\\nabla } \\rho ( \\vec{r},t ) \\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\frac{1}{2 } e^{i(\\vec{k}_{\\perp } \\vec{r}_{\\perp } + \\phi_{2z}(z)-\\omega t ) } [ 2i { k}_{2z}(z ) \\frac{\\partial a_2}{\\partial z } + i",

    "this procedure provides to neglect the conjugated terms , which appear fast oscillating ( when averaging over the oscillation period they become zero ) .",
    "considering the right part of ( [ 4 ] ) let us take into account that microscopic currents and densities are the sums of terms , containing delta - functions , therefore , the right part can be rewritten as : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the time of entrance of particle @xmath13 to the resonator , @xmath68 is the time of particle leaving from the resonator , @xmath69functions in ( ref5 ) image the fact that for time moments preceding @xmath70 and following @xmath71 the particle @xmath72 does not contribute in process .    let us suppose now that a strong magnetic field is applied for beam guiding though the generation area .",
    "thus , the problem appears one - dimensional ( components @xmath73 and @xmath74 are suppressed ) .",
    "averaging the right part of ( [ 5 ] ) over the particle positions inside the beam , points of particle entrance to the resonator @xmath75 and time of particle entrance to the resonator @xmath67 we can obtain : @xmath76 where @xmath5 is the electron beam density , @xmath77 is the mean electron beam velocity , which depends on time due to energy losses , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 indicates averaging over transversal coordinate of point of particle entrance to the resonator @xmath75 and time of particle entrance to the resonator  @xmath67 .    according to @xcite averaging procedure in ( [ 6 ] ) can be simplified , when consider that random phases , appearing due to random transversal coordinate and time of entrance , presents in ( [ 6 ] ) as differences .",
    "therefore , double integration over @xmath81 can be replaced by single integration @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ 4 ] ) in this case converts to : @xmath82 where the currents @xmath83 , @xmath84 are determined by the expression @xmath85",
    "@xmath86 @xmath87 is the current density , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath83 for @xmath92 independent on @xmath61 was obtained in @xcite .",
    "when more than two waves participate in diffraction process , the system ( [ sys2 ] ) should be supplemented with equations for waves @xmath93 , which are similar to those for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "now we can find the equation for phase . from the expressions ( [ phi1],[phi2 ] ) it follows that @xmath96 let us introduce new function @xmath97 az follows : @xmath98    therefore , @xmath99 in the one - dimensional case the equation ( [ sys11 ] ) can be written as : @xmath100 therefore , @xmath101",

    "it is well - known that @xmath107 therefore , @xmath108    the above obtained equations ( [ sys2],[cz],[cz2],[gamma1 ] ) provide to describe generation process in fel with varied parameters of diffraction grating ( photonic crystal ) .",
    "analysis of the system ( [ cz2 ] ) can be simplified by replacement of the @xmath109 with its averaged by the initial phase value @xmath110 note that the law of parameters change can be both smooth and stair - step .",
    "use of photonic crystals provide to develop different vfel arrangements ( see fig.[volume ] ) .",
    "= 10 cm    it should be noted that , for example , in the fel ( twt , bwo ) resonator with changing in space parameters of grating ( photonic crystal ) the electromagnetic wave with depending on @xmath61 spatial period is formed .",
    "this means that the dynamical undulator with depending on @xmath61 period appears along the whole resonator length i. e. tapering dynamical wiggler becomes settled .",
    "it is well known that tapering wiggler can significantly increase efficiency of the undulator fel . the dynamical wiggler with varied period , which is proposed , can be used for development of double - cascaded fel with parameters changing in space .",
    "the efficiency of such system can be significantly higher that of conventional system .",
    "moreover , the period of dynamical wiggler can be done much shorter than that available for wigglers using static magnetic fields .",
    "it should be also noted that , due to dependence of the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave on time , compression of the radiation pulse is possible in such a system .",
