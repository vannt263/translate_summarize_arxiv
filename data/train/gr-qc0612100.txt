    ", width=316 ]    dynamical simulations of binary black holes have so far only been carried out for a very limited number of parameters ( e.g.  mass ratio and black hole spin ) , and it will be very important to systematically investigate the dependence of the waves on these parameters ( compare  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , black hole spin may effect both the amplitude and the duration of the merger waves .",
    "for aligned black hole spins the merger takes longer than for anti - aligned black hole spins @xcite .",
    "in addition , the interaction between spin and orbital angular momentum may play a role in the dynamics of the merger ( even though the speculations of @xcite have not been confirmed by the dynamical simulations of @xcite ) .",
    "an important next step in confirming these speculations is to use the waveforms from numerical simulations as sample signals in real detector noise and passed through the current detection pipelines .",
    "this would be facilitated by the development of an archive of gravitational waveforms in a uniform format that could be used openly by the gravitational - wave detection community to calibrate their searches and their pipelines .",
    "activities in this direction are already under way  @xcite ; with the intention of developing into a useful resource for gravitational - wave astronomy . as an aside , to expedite their use in data analysis , these waveforms should be provided as equally sampled time series , with time in units of seconds and scaled to a physical distance of @xmath166 from the binary .    despite recent computational and algorithmic advances ,",
    "numerical simulations are costly and will be for years to come . in appendix [ app_cost ] , we present order of magnitude estimates of the computational cost of simulations needed to produce parameter space surveys of a given accuracy and physical evolution time .",
    "this suggests that it will be impossible to populate a template bank solely with the results of numerical simulations in the near to medium term .",
    "it is therefore interesting to devise approximate methods which might capture the essential features of the merger phase .",
    "one possible approach would be to use pn methods for the early phase and close limit approximations for the late phase with a judiciously chosen behavior in between .",
    "adopting such approximate methods requires a careful understanding of the sensitivity of detection methods to differences in the approximate waveforms .",
    "while the direct observation of gravitational waves will be a huge achievement , we hope that the first detection will only mark the beginning of gravitational - wave astronomy .",
    "this field is built on the premise that we can decode information about the sources of gravitational waves from the signals observed at a detector . to achieve this goal",
    ", we need the ability to simulate the generation of gravitational waves by various sources .",
    "moreover , it is the imprint of the sources on the waves that will carry some of the most interesting information .      by exploring the results of merger simulations from the perspective of data analysis we can obtain a better picture of what we would be able to learn about compact object interactions from future observations .",
    "therefore it will be very important in the near future to perform surveys of a wide variety of initial data parameters ( in particular varying mass ratios and spin vectors ) , not so much to build template libraries , but to understand what the broad features of merger look like through the lense of a gravitational wave detector .",
    "for example , it has long been anticipated that the onset of the binary merger , at which the slow and adiabatic binary inspiral changes into a dynamical plunge , would occur at an inner - most stable circular orbit and would leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational wave signal , which could be measured in gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "while the recent dynamical simulations of binary black holes do not reveal any abrupt change in the waveform , there does appear to be a break in the frequency spectrum of the waves which occurs somewhere between the predicted isco frequency and the quasi - normal mode frequency  see fig .",
    "[ f : spectrum ] , and further discussion of this in @xcite .",
    "it is certainly plausible that this break in frequency becomes more pronounced as one moves away from the equal mass , non - spinning regime .    black hole coalescence has also been regarded as giving rise to an arena where the strong - field , non - linear regime of general relativity will be clearly revealed to observers .",
    "the early simulations show perhaps a disappointing lack of such features , where except for a very short and smooth transition between inspiral and ringdown , much of the waveform can be understood using perturbative techniques .",
    "another way of stating this is that all waveforms to date are dominated by the quadrupole harmonic . in general",
    "one would expect non - linear effects to result in mode coupling .",
    "again , that we do not see significant higher order harmonics could be due to the restricted initial conditions so far considered ; however , at the very least this is telling us that manifest strong - field effects are not ubiquitous in this type of black hole collisions , and the community will need to search harder to find richer regions of astrophysically relevant parameter space . whether this observation remains as such in more generic cases will have strong consequences for the simulation and analysis sides . on one hand , deciphering the non - linear effects",
    "would require significantly more accurate simulations and a considerably denser template bank for data analysis .",
    "on the other hand however , these templates could be parametrized in a rather simple form like that in eq .",
    "( [ e : reparametrized ] ) .      for binary neutron stars",
    "the situation is significantly different from that for binary black holes .",
    "depending on the equation of state , stellar masses and spins , the merger of binary neutron stars may be triggered either by a plunge after the two stars reach an isco , or by roche lobe overflow ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in either case",
    ", the merger is expected to occur at a gravitational wave frequency of approximately 2 khz , outside of ligo s most sensitive regime .",
    "that means that the current ligo configuration is more sensitive to the inspiral phase , which may be well approximated by post - newtonian calculations , than the merger of binary neutron stars , which has to be modeled with numerical relativity .",
    "hence , the role of numerical relativity in observing binary neutron stars is different from its role for binary black holes . in the near - term",

    "the prospect of observing gravitational radiation from the merger of binary neutron stars is very exciting because it is very rich in physical effects that may play an important role . unlike binary black holes , which are governed entirely by einstein s field equations ,",
    "the dynamical evolution of binary neutron stars also depends on the equation of state , magnetic fields , radiation and neutrino transport , and possibly other effects .",
    "realistic , nuclear equations of state have already been adopted in simulations of binary neutron star mergers @xcite , and numerical codes that incorporate general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics have been developed ( e.g.  @xcite ) . detecting a binary neutron star merger",
    "may therefore establish important observational constraints on these aspects , in particular the equation of state .",
    "clearly , this is a very exciting prospect .    as discussed above",
    ", it is unlikely that the current gravitational - wave detectors could observe the details of the merger .",
    "numerical relativity may nevertheless play an important role for the purposes of data analysis , namely by identifying features in the gravitational wave signal that could provide particularly important information .",
    "a concrete example is the question whether or not the merger remnant promptly collapses to a black hole .",
    "depending on the equation of state , binary neutron stars may either collapse to a black hole on a dynamical timescale after merger or the remnant may form a `` hypermassive '' neutron star supported against collapse by virtue of differential rotation  @xcite . for binaries with fixed masses",
    "the pre - merger gravitational - wave signal is quite similar , but the post - merger signal differs significantly for the two scenarios . distinguishing these post - merger signals would therefore provide an important constraint on the neutron - star equation of state . unfortunately , the post - merger signal typically has a frequency close to 4 khz @xcite and may require advanced , perhaps specialized , detectors to extract significant information ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "investigations of these waves and the information they carry could therefore be used to inform development of advanced gravitational - wave detectors .      for mixed black hole - neutron star binaries",
    "the situation is different again .",
    "the inspiral can have two very different outcomes : either the neutron star is tidally disrupted by the black hole before it reaches the isco , or it reaches the isco first and spirals into the black hole more or less intact .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the neutron star can only be disrupted tidally outside the isco for relatively small stellar - mass black holes with @xmath173 .",
    "this regime is very interesting for a number of astrophysical reasons .",
    "such a disruption may act as the central engine of short gamma ray bursts , and , as for binary neutron stars , a detection may provide useful constraints on the equation of state .",
    "it is also this regime that requires numerical relativity simulations for quantitative predictions . extending the above crude estimates , the orbital frequency at the onset of tidal disruption is approximately @xmath174 which is the same order as the inverse of the neutron star s dynamical timescale .",
    "as for the merger of binary neutron stars , the corresponding gravitational - wave frequency is outside of ligo s most sensitive wave band .",
    "the role of numerical relativity is therefore again to explore these scenarios and identify particularly interesting frequency regimes .",
    "numerical relativity simulations of mixed black hole - neutron star binaries are not as far advanced as those of black hole binaries or neutron star binaries .",
    "so far , fully relativistic , self - consistent studies exist for quasi - equilibrium models @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first fully self - consistent , dynamical simulations of the binary inspiral and the tidal disruption of the neutron star have been announced very recently @xcite ( see also @xcite for simulations of extreme mass - ratio binaries within the so - called wilson - mathews approximation , which assumes that the spatial metric remains conformally flat ) .",
    "other groups have also initiated studies of mixed binaries @xcite .",
    "clearly , more comprehensive studies of tidal break - up in black hole - neutron star binaries remain an important and urgent goal .",

    "for instance ,    * if @xmath193 , commonly employed formulae which replaces @xmath194 by integrals of @xmath16 , lack non - trivial contributions from products of @xmath182 and ( time derivatives of ) the conformal factor @xmath195 relating the angular metric @xmath196 to the unit sphere metric @xmath187  see eq .",
    "( [ psi4shear ] ) . recall",
    "that since @xmath196 is the metric of a sphere , it is conformally related to that of the unit sphere by @xmath197 * if @xmath198 , inertial observers suffer a rotation ( from the induced shift @xmath199 ) .",
    "therefore , predictions like the waveforms at a particular angle will be affected as inertial coordinates are shifting around the worldtube .",
    "this will influence the extraction of multipole contributions , since the spin - weighted spherical harmonics employed in such a task do not take into account the shift in the angular coordinates ( see @xcite for a related discussion of these issues at @xmath200 ) . *",
    "if @xmath201 the radiation measured by different observers at a constant @xmath185 slice does not correspond to the same inertial time . thus the extracted waveforms would have to be mapped , at each angle to the real inertial time .",
    "it is clear that these issues can introduce systematic effects that can be either corrected or at least estimated within a given simulation .",
    "notice that these issues can not be completely addressed with an improved tetrad choice as any tetrad must satisfy @xmath202 .",
    "thus , the induced metric in all cases will be the same .",
    "nevertheless a convenient choice of tetrad aids , in particular , to alleviate issues related to the proximity of the extraction worldtube to the source .",
    "it is useful to first at least determine the magnitude of the effects the issues discussed above might have in a given simulation .",
    "then if required , these effects can be corrected by suitably modifying the employed expressions to remove many of the ambiguities . in what follows",
    "we describe the first part , while a discussion of the second will be presented elsewhere@xcite and applied in relevant scenarios@xcite .",
    "first and foremost is estimating the amount that the above mentioned effects can have on @xmath16 .",
    "we will ignore here those coming due to the extraction at finite distances as a comparison of obtained results at different radii can be employed to estimate this effect . furthermore , assuming the extraction takes place sufficiently far away , the difference between a derivative in the time labeling the timelike hypersurfaces and null hypersurfaces beyond gauge factors which we will discuss later is given by the contribution of spatial derivatives off the extraction worldtube times @xmath142 factors due to an approximate `` potential '' from the source .",
    "this effect is also controlled by placing the extraction sphere sufficiently far and comparing the obtained results at different radii . under these assumptions ,",
    "the main contribution to the error in assigning the radiation to the straightforwardly calculated @xmath16 is given by the discrepancy of the extraction sphere being in agreement with that of a bondi frame .",
    "this is made evident by the failure of the induced metric on the sphere to be that of the unit sphere@xcite .",
    "in turn one has @xmath203 , which can be re - expressed in terms of @xmath204 with @xmath187 the unit sphere metric .",
    "the correction to @xmath16 is given by @xmath205 with @xmath206 the _ eth _ operator which is a particular combination of derivatives on the sphere@xcite .",
    "thus , unless @xmath207 , a non - trivial correction must be considered from the fact that the extraction sphere is not inertial .",
    "certainly this will occur as the very radiation one is trying to compute will be responsible for accelerating the sphere .",
    "the key message is then to estimate the role @xmath195 will play . to this end",
    "two calculations can be performed .",
    "first , a partial answer on the value of @xmath195 can be obtained by simply evaluating @xmath208 . if @xmath209 , then @xmath210 and it can therefore play a non - trivial role . however , if @xmath211 it is not necessarily the case that @xmath212 .",
    "a more involved , though now complete , recipe to obtain @xmath195 can be easily obtained by computing the ricci scalar associated with @xmath196 and @xmath187 and the fact that the two metrics are conformally related by @xmath195 .",
    "this gives rise to the expression @xmath213 .",
    "notice that @xmath212 is a solution if @xmath196 is the unit sphere metric , hence , short of obtaining a solution for @xmath195 , an estimate of ignoring this fact can be obtained by @xmath214 . naturally , if @xmath215 remains well below the measured waveforms , the straightforward use of @xmath16 would be warranted . to simplify the numerical calculation of @xmath216 one",
    "can make use of the gauss - codacci relations for a 2-dimensional hypersurface @xmath217 in a three - dimensional manifold @xmath218 and employ quantities readily available on @xmath218 . defining the extrinsic curvature of @xmath217 by @xmath219 ( with @xmath220 , the induced metric on @xmath217 with normal @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 ) , a straightforward calculation indicates @xmath224 in addition to the conformal factor @xmath195 being taken properly into account , a bondi frame satisfies that observers measure an affine time along @xmath141 and proceed along constant angular coordinates .",
    "these conditions will be met unless @xmath225 . here",
    "again norms could be defined as @xmath226 so as to obtain an estimate of the effect these issues might have in the extraction process .      to illustrate some of the effects of coordinate conditions that are not well adapted to the extraction mechanism we adopt a spacetime containing linearized gravitational waves  @xcite . for our particular example , the spacetime is described in terms of the following line element @xmath227 where @xmath228 and @xmath229 with @xmath230 and for simplicity we have adopted @xmath231 in reference  @xcite . while a detailed discussion of of problematic issues that can arise in the extraction proceess as well as ways to handle them will be discussed elsewhere@xcite we here illustrate the effect that some of these will have in a simple scenario .",
    "notice that the line element [ eq : teuwaves ] satisfies all the mentioned properties , in particular @xmath188 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 ( with @xmath234 and @xmath235 $ ] ) . for clarity",
    ", we will concentrate on two very simple cases that will violate these conditions defined by @xmath236 and @xmath237.the former introduces a time - dependent variation in the location of the extraction radius with respect to a physically defined areal radius .",
    "the latter induces a shift along the @xmath238 direction . following the commonly used approach one obtains for @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath239 with @xmath240 ; clearly , while a calculation of the radiated energy would be immune to the value of @xmath241 the actual waveforms would be affected . additionally , both would be affected by the functional dependence of @xmath242 , which even when chosen initially to be unity , it will vary as waves propagate outwards affecting the spacetime .",
    "clearly a generic situation would not be as simple as the one analyzed above , though it serves to make evident how these issues can be obscured in a non - trivial extraction of physical quantities in an otherwise correctly obtained numerical solution .",
    "here we present an order of magnitude estimate of the computational cost of simulating a binary black hole merger for a specified number of orbits , and where we want to extract some feature of the solution to within a given accuracy .",
    "more precisely , if the cpu run time and estimated net solution error of a fiducial simulation are known , we give an order of magnitude estimate for the cpu run time that a second simulation will take to obtain a new result with the same accuracy but from an evolution that completes a different number of orbits before merger .",
    "assume the numerical error @xmath243 in some desired property of the solution ( for example the phase evolution of the gravitational waveform ) has the following dependence on physical time @xmath84 and characteristic discretization scale @xmath43 : @xmath244 here @xmath245 is a positive constant of order unity , and @xmath42 is the order of the discretization method . in general the growth of error will be more complicated than this simple power law , though for an order of magnitude estimate this expression is sufficient .",
    "note also that we have assumed the code has been `` cured '' of any exponential growth in error . in an adaptive code",
    "there will be several mesh spacings @xmath43 , though the scaling relationships derived below will still be correct if all mesh resolutions are changed by the same factor when the resolution is changed .",
    "equation ( [ ass_error ] ) is strictly only valid for finite - difference codes , though in the final expression below we can take the limit as @xmath246 to get estimates for spectral codes .",
    "this will give us an idea of the scaling of present pseudo - spectral codes in the regime where the leading source of error comes from the spatial discretization and not the finite - difference time stepper .",
    "a more useful parameter describing the physical run time @xmath84 of the simulation is the number of orbits @xmath247 completed before coalescence , and we will assume that the inspiral regime of the merger dominates the run - time .",
    "we can use the leading order post newtonian expression for equal mass , quasi circular inspirals to estimate @xmath51 : @xmath248    the final ingredient in our scaling estimates will be the manner in which computational run time @xmath249 scales with mesh spacing @xmath43 for any _ optimal _ grid - based solution method of a @xmath250 dimensional system of partial differential equations @xmath251    the first question we can now answer is the following : given that simulation @xmath79 required @xmath252 cpu hours to complete a simulation of a binary system exhibiting @xmath253 orbits before coalescence , and from which we extracted a desired quantity with error @xmath254 , how long @xmath255 will it take to run second simulation of a similar binary system , now with @xmath256 orbits before coalescence but the _ same _ net error @xmath257 ? using ( [ ass_error]-[th ] ) we find @xmath258 for example , assuming linear growth of error ( @xmath259 ) , we get @xmath260 , where @xmath261 for @xmath262 respectively .",
    "note that the difference going from @xmath263 to @xmath264 order accuracy is quite significant , as is the jump from @xmath264 to `` spectral '' convergence @xmath265 .",
    "the same holds when estimating the accuracy achieved by different order - of - accuracy operators in modeling modes in the solution @xcite .",
    "this implies that while higher order methods are important , a significant gain is already achieved at @xmath264 order .",
    "an application of the preceding expression is to the recent survey of unequal mass inspirals presented in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath264 order accurate code ( @xmath266 ) discussed there is quite fast by today s standards , and they were able to perform the survey utilizing a total of about @xmath267 cpu hours ( recall however that the cost of these simulations is in practice further alleviated by exploiting the problem s symmetry ) .",
    "the majority of initial conditions ran exhibited about @xmath268 orbits before merger .",
    "suppose the survey were repeated ( including calibration runs , etc . ) , but now starting with initial conditions resulting in @xmath269 orbits prior to merger .",
    "equation ( [ tb_ta ] ) suggests ( assuming @xmath259 ) it would take around @xmath270 million cpu hours to complete with the same level of overall accuracy .",
    "early comparisons of numerical versus pn waveforms @xcite suggest more than 4 orbits are needed to begin to study the adequacy of various pn approximants .",
    "suppose @xmath271 were sufficient , and the survey of @xcite were repeated for the purpose of pn comparisons([tb_ta ] ) then suggests @xmath272 million cpu hours would be needed .",
    "this would require a @xmath273 node cluster running continuously for 1 year .",
    "of course , we are _ not _ suggesting that such a survey is necessary for pn comparison purposes , we are merely illustrating ( [ tb_ta ] ) using actual data for the reference simulation `` @xmath79 '' as given in @xcite .",
    "a second interesting question we can give a rough answer to is , given simulation @xmath79 has accumulated an error @xmath254 for an @xmath253 orbit simulation , what is the expected error for simulation @xmath274 that completes @xmath256 orbits , assuming simulations @xmath79 and @xmath274 have identical resolution @xmath275 ? : @xmath276 at a first glance it might seem strange that the accumulation of error is independent of the order of the discretization scheme . though observe that this does _ not _ imply that a lower order scheme is just as `` fast '' as a high order method even if both methods exhibit similar growth factors @xmath245 , for in general it will take more resolution for a low order method to get to the same level of error @xmath277 as a higher order method . from ( [ th ] ) the ratio of run times @xmath278 for two different resolutions @xmath279 and @xmath280 , regardless of the order of convergence for an optimal solution method , scales as @xmath281 .",
