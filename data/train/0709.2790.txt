    "physically , quantum dots are nanostructures with a charge carriers confinement in all space directions .",
    "they have an atom - like energy spectrum which can be modified by adjusting geometric parameters of the dots as well as by the presence of an impurity .",
    "thus the study of these dependencies may be of interest from the point of view of the nanoscopic physics .",
    "a detailed analysis of three - dimensional quantum dots with a short - range impurity in the euclidean space can be found in @xcite .",
    "therein , the harmonic oscillator potential was used to introduce the confinement , and the impurity was modeled by a point interaction ( @xmath1-potential ) .",
    "the starting point of the analysis was derivation of a formula for the green function of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( i.e. , in the impurity free case ) , and application of the krein resolvent formula jointly with the notion of the krein @xmath0-function .",
    "the current paper is devoted to a similar model in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the nontrivial hyperbolic geometry attracts regularly attention , and its influence on the properties of quantum - mechanical systems has been studied on various models ( see , for example , @xcite ) . here",
    "we make use of the same method as in @xcite to investigate a quantum dot with impurity in the lobachevsky plane .",
    "we will introduce an appropriate hamiltonian in a manner quite analogous to that of @xcite and derive an explicit formula for the corresponding green function . in this sense ,",
    "our model is solvable , and thus its properties may be of interest also from the mathematical point of view .    during the computations to follow ,",
    "the spheroidal functions appear naturally .",
    "unfortunately , the notation in the literature concerned with this type of special functions is not yet uniform ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is why we supply , for the reader s convenience , a short appendix comprising basic definitions and results related to spheroidal functions which are necessary for our approach .",
    "denote by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the geodesic polar coordinates on the lobachevsky plane .",
    "then the metric tensor is diagonal and reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , denotes the so called curvature radius which is related to the scalar curvature by the formula @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the volume form equals @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a free particle of mass @xmath10 takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the laplace - beltrami operator and @xmath13 .",
    "we have set @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of a potential modeling the confinement is ambiguous .",
    "we naturally require that the potential takes the standard form of the quantum dot potential in the flat limit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this is to say that , in the limiting case , it becomes the potential of the isotropic harmonic oscillator @xmath16 .",
    "however , this condition clearly does not specify the potential uniquely .",
    "having the freedom of choice let us discuss the following two possibilities : @xmath17    potential @xmath18 is the same as that proposed in @xcite for the classical harmonic oscillator on the lobachevsky plane . with this choice",
    ", it has been demonstrated in @xcite that the model is superintegrable , i.e. , there exist three functionally independent constants of motion .",
    "let us remark that this potential is bounded , and so it represents a bounded perturbation to the free hamiltonian .",
    "on the other hand , the potential @xmath19 is unbounded .",
    "moreover , as shown below , the stationary schrdinger equation for this potential leads , after the partial wave decomposition , to the differential equation of spheroidal functions .",
    "the current paper concentrates exclusively on case b ) .",
    "the impurity is modeled by a @xmath1-potential which is introduced with the aid of self - adjoint extensions and is determined by boundary conditions at the base point .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the impurity is located in the center of the dot ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus we start from the following symmetric operator : @xmath21      substituting @xmath22 we obtain @xmath23      = : \\frac{1}{a^{2}}\\tilde{h } , \\\\      & { \\mathop\\mathrm{dom}\\nolimits}(h ) = c^{\\infty}_{0}((1,\\infty)\\times s^1 )      \\subset l^{2}\\left((1,\\infty)\\times s^1 ,        a^{2}{\\mathrm{d}}\\xi\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\phi\\right ) .",
