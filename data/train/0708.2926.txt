    "we use the bond - mean - field theory ( bmft ) , which is based on the jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation , to study the quantum criticality phenomenon in the frustrated antiferromagnetic ( af ) two - leg heisenberg ladder , and the effect of temperature on this criticality @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to the heisenberg single chain , two - leg ladder , and three - leg ladder without frustration with excellent results @xcite . when the diagonal interaction is varied",
    "the two - leg ladder system can undergo a quantum phase transition between two of three distinct non - magnetic quantum spin liquid states ; the nel - type ( n - type ) state , ferromagnetic - type rung ( r - type ) state , and ferromagnetic - type chain ( f - type ) state .",
    "these states are characterized by ferromagnetic spin arrangements along the diagonals , rungs , or chains respectively .",
    "the bmft is a mean - field theory that is based on the spin bond parameters .",
    "the latter are related to the spin - spin correlation function @xmath0 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 labeling two adjacent sites in the direction where this correlation function is calculated .",
    "all quantities @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , are zero in bmft , implying the absence of any sort of long - range magnetic order .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spin-@xmath5 two - leg ladder with diagonal interactions is written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the coupling along the chains , @xmath8 the coupling along the rungs , and @xmath9 the coupling along the diagonals as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : two leg ladder ] .",
    "the index @xmath1 labels the position of the spins along the two chains , each of which has @xmath10 sites , and @xmath2 labels the chains . as usual , @xmath11 is the spin operator .        the frustrated two - leg ladder has been studied numerically using the ising and dimer expansions  @xcite , the lanczos diagonalization technique  @xcite , and the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied analytically using the bosonization  @xcite , the valence - bond spin wave theory  @xcite , a non - perturbative effective - field theory  @xcite , the non - linear sigma model  @xcite , the reformulated weak - coupling field theory  @xcite , and the lieb - mattis theorem  @xcite .",
    "none of these analytical works addressed the issue of the phase diagram in all regimes including the weak , intermediate , and strong coupling limits . within the bmft",
    ", the phase diagram and its temperature dependence can be easily examined in all these regimes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we explain how the bmft , which is based on the jw transformation in dimensions higher than one , is applied to our hamiltonian .",

    "the phases @xmath17 are chosen so that at the the spin operators commutation relations are preserved .    after applying the jw transformation  ( [ eq:2d jw ] ) to the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) we get @xmath18.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in bmft",
    ", the interacting terms of the jw fermions are decoupled using the spin bond parameters .",
    "this approximation neglects fluctuations around the mean field points ; @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are any operators which are quadratic in @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath24 to apply bmft we introduce three mean - field bond parameters ; @xmath25 in the longitudinal direction , @xmath26 in the transverse direction , and @xmath27 along the diagonal .",
    "these can be interpreted as effective hopping energies for the jw fermions  @xcite in the longitudinal , transverse and diagonal directions , respectively : @xmath28 keeping in mind that there is no long - range order  @xcite so that @xmath29 , the ising quartic terms in equation  ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) can be decoupled using the hartree - fock approximation  ( [ eq : hf ] ) , and the bond parameters  ( [ eq : bondparameters ] ) as follows : @xmath30        for the ising interaction along the chain 1 .",
    "similar equations can be obtained for the interactions along the other directions .",
    "next , we write the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) using the three different spin configurations in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jd1 ] .",
    "these configurations are instantaneous ( not static ) configurations in which adjacent spins in any direction keep on average the same relative orientations with respect to each other , but fluctuate globally on a time scale determined by the strongest coupling constant so that any kind of long - range magnetic order is absent .",
    "these fluctuations are a consequence of the spin quantum fluctuations .",
    "the three competing configurations of fig . [ fig : jd1 ] lead to three different quantum gapped spin liquid states , each characterized by its own short - range spin correlations and symmetry . we also choose to place an alternating phase of @xmath31 along the chains so that the phase per plaquette is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this phase configuration is used to get rid of the phase terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we also set @xmath32 where @xmath25 is site independent @xcite . here",
    "@xmath33 is the phase of the bond along the chain ; i.e. , if @xmath34 on a given bond , then it is equal to @xmath31 on the adjacent ones .",
    "this is necessary in order to recover the proper result in the limit @xmath9 and @xmath35 becoming zero , in which we get an energy spectrum comparable to that of des cloiseaux and pearson  @xcite for the spin excitation in a single heisenberg chain , @xmath36    for each state the hamiltonian is written in the nambu formalism and the matrix is diagonalized to obtain four eigenenergies ( for each of the states ) .",

    "the eigenenergies for the n , f , and r - type states are given respectively by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",

    "the free ( ground - state ) energies of all three states are calculated as functions of the coupling constants and compared . from thermodynamic considerations",
    "the state with the lowest free energy is the stable one , and whenever free energies cross a phase transition takes place .",
    "since only the ratios of the couplings are important we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this way we have obtained the zero and finite temperature phase diagrams which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] .",
    "the agreement between the lanczos method data and our results is very good , a fact that indicates that the present mean - field treatment is acceptable .",
    "the line at @xmath46 is exact and its placement is a consequence of the hamiltonian symmetry with respect to exchanging @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the quantum phase transitions ( zero temperature ) found here using bmft are first - order ones for all values of @xmath47 . as temperature increases the r - type state decreases in size .",
