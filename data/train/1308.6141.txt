    "a graph is hamiltonian if it contains a cycle which goes through all vertices exactly once .",
    "determining if a graph is hamiltonian is known as a np - complete problem and no satisfactory characterization for these graphs has been found .",
    "a huge body of literature exists on the subject surveyed for instance in @xcite .    in @xcite , bondy and chvtal introduced a way to get round the hamiltonicity problem complexity by using a closure of the graph .",
    "the closure is then proved to be hamiltonian if and only if the graph is . in particular , if the closure is a complete graph then the graph is hamiltonian . since this seminal article ,",
    "several closure concepts preserving hamiltonicity were introduced ( for a survey on the topic , see for instance @xcite ) . in particular z. ryjcek defined in @xcite a closure concept for claw - free graphs based on local completion .",
    "the local completion is repeatedly performed on every _ eligible _ vertex , as long as such a vertex exists .    following a different approach , goodman and hedetniemi gave in @xcite a sufficient condition for hamiltonicity based on the existence of a clique - covering of the graph .",
    "this condition was recently generalized in @xcite using the notion of _ eulerian _ clique - covering .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite , that there exists an eulerian clique - covering of a graph if and only if there exists a _ normal _",
    "one , where a clique - covering is normal if it contains the closed neighborhood of every simplicial vertex of the graph . in this context ,",
    "closure concepts based on local completion are interesting since , then , the closure of a graph contains more simplicial vertices than the graph itself , making the search for a normal clique - covering easier . for instance",
    ", a closure in the sense of @xcite has at most one _ normal _ eulerian clique - covering .    in @xcite a new closure concept based on local completion and preserving hamiltonicity for all graphs",
    "is studied .",
    "the closure is defined using the notion of _ neighborhood - equivalence _ as first introduced in @xcite , and is obtained by performing a local completion at all _ neighborhood - equivalence eligible ( n - eligible ) _ vertices of the graph .    in the sequel ,",
    "we generalize n - eligibility using the notion _",

    "definition [ dfn2-eligible ] ) .",
    "we show how to obtain the _ n2-closure _ of a graph by performing recursively a local completion at a chosen _ n2-eligible _ vertex . the n2-closure is then proved to be hamiltonian if and only if the graph is . in particular , the n2-closure is a supergraph of the n - closure whenever the n - eligible vertices are chosen first during the completion process .    in a first section , we introduce some notations and remind the reader of the definitions of local completion and neighborhood - equivalence . in a second section ,",
    "we introduce _ alternating _ paths and present some of their properties .",
    "finally , in section [ secmain ] , these paths are used to show that , for all graph @xmath0 and choice function @xmath1 on the set of vertices of @xmath0 , the n2-closure of @xmath0 is a n2-eligible free graph which circumference is equal to the circumference of @xmath0 .",
