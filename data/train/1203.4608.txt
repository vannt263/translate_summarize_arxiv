    "bilayer graphene@xcite ( blg ) is a crystal which consists of two monolayers of honeycomb carbon lattice arranged according the bernal stacking known from bulk graphite @xcite . in a bernal stacked lattice , one out of the two sites on the upper monolayer resides directly over a site on the lower lattice , and the the other carbon atoms are on / under the centers of the hexagons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : blg3d ] ) .",
    "such a crystal has a very high symmetry with symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "this high symmetry may be lifted by the formation of correlated states of electrons .",
    "there is a plethora of ways the symmetry can be lifted , some of which have been discussed in the recent literature : the ferroelectric - layer asymmetric state @xcite , the layer polarized antiferromagnetic state@xcite , the quantum anomalous hall state @xcite , the `` spin flux''/ quantum spin hall state@xcite , the charge density wave state@xcite and an anisotropic nematic liquid@xcite .",
    "some of the proposed phases above have a gap in the electronic spectrum ( ferroelectric , antiferromagnetic , spin - flux , cdw ) , whereas in the other phases ( nematic , ferromagnetic ) no gap is formed .",
    "this large variety of possibilities makes the theory of electronic properties of blg a very interesting and challenging subject .",
    "the complexity of the theoretical problem is compounded by two factors .",
    "one is a lack of precise information about the relevant interaction constants which determine the electronic phase in undoped pristine blg .",
    "the other issue is the competition between exchange energy contributions for a large number of candidate phases which makes the determination of the ground state non - trivial , even with precise knowledge of the interaction constants .    on the experimental side ,",
    "several contradicting observations have been reported based on interpretations of the measured transport properties of suspended samples in terms of a gapful or gapless spectrum of electronic excitations@xcite .",
    "however , all of these works as well as optical studies of blg @xcite indicate that the high - energy properties ( but below @xmath1 ) of blg are well described by the two band model @xcite without interactions .",
    "this makes a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the problem starting from the weak coupling even more timely . in this paper",
    ", we employ the previously developed rg approach @xcite to identify the possible scenarios of symmetry breaking phase transition in blg at low temperature and zero carrier density .    the tendency to form a state with spontaneously broken symmetry",
    "is encoded in the system response to local symmetry breaking fluctuations , in particular in their mutual interaction , @xmath2 here @xmath3 are operators creating local density fluctuations breaking lattice symmetry , with @xmath4 expressed in terms of electron annihilation and creation operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are coupling constants .",
    "each of the fluctuations @xmath3 belong to one of the irreducible representations @xmath8 ( irreps ) of the symmetry group of the lattice .",

    "if hamiltonian ( [ eq : hintintro ] ) is dominated by one term with negative constant @xmath7 , we would expect it to be energetically favorable for a state with a non - zero expectation value of @xmath3 to form , with the symmetry of the ground state determine by the corresponding irrep , @xmath8 .",
    "however if the coupling constant in the dominant term is positive , then the ground state is determined by the exchange energy , which can be negative for not only for magnetic ( ferro / antiferro ) but also for non - magnetic orderings , because of the sublattice / valley matrix structure .",
    "because of the large number of irreps , this can result in a competition between many phases . therefore , to determine the ground state of blg we must know all the interaction constants @xmath7 sufficiently well , especially when the dominant ones are positive .",
    "the situation is actually even more intriguing since attraction may result in a superconducting phase with non - trivial cooper pair structure .        to add to the complexity of the problem , the values of the `` constants ''",
    "@xmath7 are not fixed .",
    "they change as a function of the energy scale @xmath9 within which the electrons establish the symmetry breaking correlations .",
    "the energy scale dependence , @xmath10 , may be calculated using the renormalization group ( rg ) approach . in the rg approach",
    "the highest energy electron states are eliminated and their effects incorporated into a redefinition of the parameters of the theory .",
    "the renormalization of blg parameters starts at the energy scale @xmath11 which limits the applicability of the two - band model with parabolic spectrum and initial conditions @xmath12 .",
    "then it is iterated until the lowest energy scale @xmath9 is reached .",
    "this energy scale @xmath9 is determined when the interaction energy in at least one of the the channels becomes of the order of kinetic energy .",
    "after this scale is reached the mean field theory can be used to establish the electronic ground state .",
    "the necessary rg equations for the constants @xmath13 and their interplay with coulomb interaction , @xmath14 have been derived for the full set of eight constants in refs .  .",
    "( similar in spirit treatment of ref .   replaced eq .",

    "calculating @xmath12 requires detailed knowledge of the microscopic orbitals which is not available at present .",
    "therefore , in this paper we explore a wide variety of initial conditions @xmath15 for the rg to find possible electronic ground states for blg .",
    "we can make some arguments to constrain the values of the @xmath12 .",
    "the coupling @xmath16 which describes the interaction of dipoles oriented perpendicular to the bilayer ( see fig . [",
    "fig : irreps ] ) must be positive at high energy scales .",
    "the four `` current - current '' interactions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are only generated by virtual processes because of time reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore we will set them to be zero at @xmath21 .    also , it is interesting to note that in the value of @xmath12 one has to take account of the interactions between electrons via polarization of the lattice .",
    "particularly , the in - plane to - lo phonons at the @xmath22-point and to phonons at the brillouin zone corner have energies comparable to @xmath21 , so that they mediate an attractive interaction via their virtual creation / absorption",
    ". these would give negative contributions to the bare values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "analogously , virtual @xmath25 phonons from @xmath26 - the brillouin zone corners give negative contribution to the value of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we make no assumption about the sign of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath27 .",
    "a set of typical outcomes of the rg flow and the resulting electronic phases is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : openplots ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : openplots ] we reproduce the earlier reported result@xcite that for the initial choice of @xmath28 the rg flow leads to a nematic phase .",

    "( [ fig : irreps ] ) , mimicking the effect of anisotropic hopping along bonds with different directions on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this breaks the six - fold rotational symmetry by selecting one of axes of the lattice . in this state",
    "the electronic spectrum remains gapless but is significantly reconstructed from the unbroken symmetry state with two four - fold degenerate dirac cones at low energy .",
    "the state has the same symmetry and spectrum as uniaxial strain@xcite , and we expect that strain will , all else equal , favor the nematic phase .",
    "figure [ fig : openplots ] shows that the nematic phase is the preferred ground state not only when @xmath30 , but in a significant section of the @xmath12 parameter space . in particular , the nematic phase always emerges from the part of the parameter space where bare electron - electron couplings causing intervalley scattering are zero ( @xmath31 ) .    in other parts of the parameter space explored in this work and illustrate in fig .",

    "the electronic excitations are gapped ( though neutral spin wave excitations are gapless ) .",
    "although the af state prevails over a significant section of the parameter space , the combinations of high energy couplings which produce the af state are not intuitive .",
    "for example , increasing the bare coupling @xmath16 does not necessarily introduce the af phase .",
    "however increasing the bare coupling @xmath27 makes the ground state af .",
    "the reason for this counter - intuitive behavior is in the complexity of the rg flows .",
    "since there are eight non - linearly coupled variables in the rg equations @xcite , the rg flow is quite complicated , and the connection between the couplings at low energy and the bare couplings at high energy is not obvious .    exploring a broader parameter space",
    "further we find more phases .",
    "a spin flux phase is found in a significant sector of the parameter space @xmath12 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : openplots ] .",
    "this spin flux phase is a state with a persistent spin current circling the honeycomb lattice rings , corresponding to the spin triplet form of representation @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ fig : irreps ] .",
    "it may be viewed as the spontaneous formation of a strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it therefore leads to a gapped electronic spectrum and possibly a quantum spin hall effect .",
    "there are two more phases which appear to some degree in the phase space explored .",
    "one is a ferroelectric phase ( fe ) . the fe phase a trivial band gap insulator where the bilayer becomes spontaneously charged like a capacitor .",
    "it is a completely gapped phase .",
    "it corresponds to representation @xmath33 precisely the same representation as af but spin singlet , rather than spin triplet .",

    "we will use the matrix notation defined in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] .",
    "phases are defined by all possible expectations @xmath269 that belong to an irreducible representations ( irrep ) of the symmetry group @xmath270 of blg .",
    "every phase defines a subgroup @xmath271 of @xmath270 consisting of all operations that leave @xmath231 invariant .",
    "two phases within an irrep are distinct if their invariant subgroups are not conjugate .",
    "( recall two subgroups @xmath272 and @xmath273 of a group @xmath270 are conjugate if they is an element of @xmath274 such that @xmath275 ) .",
    "this definition is correct is in the sense that it gives all physically distinct states that may be reached via a second order phase transition at the highest critical temperature , per the usual landau theory .",
    "let us notice , however , that the anomalous averages belonging to the same irrep of the original group @xmath270 may correspond to the different phases .",
    "for example , @xmath276 and @xmath277 are both charge density waves with a tripled unit cell transforming in the @xmath257 representation .",
    "however , these two phases are distinct since @xmath278 is invariant under rotations by @xmath50 around a lattice site , whereas @xmath279 is not invariant under any conjugate operation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gphasesfig ] . as a further example",
    ", a canted anti - ferromagnetic phase would be given by @xmath280 .",
    "this is not considered in the present classification since it does not belong to an irrep of @xmath270 ( it is a linear combination elements of the @xmath33 and @xmath32 representations ) . of course",
    "all such mixed states may be constructed from linear combinations of phases in our classification .",
    "we classify the phases according to the symmetry group @xmath270 of blg which is effective at intermediate energies , see sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . in this regime",
    "the effect of rg irrelevant perturbations such as umklapp scattering may be ignored , and rg relevant but weak perturbations , such as trigonal warping and spin - orbit coupling , may be neglected .",
    "this approximation should be effective at energies between @xmath281 and @xmath282 , which contains any energy scale associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this regime",
    "the symmetry group is @xmath283 the first subgroup , @xmath284 , is generated by infinitesimal spatial rotations @xmath285 and inversion @xmath286 of the blg plane .",
    "the second subgroup , @xmath287 , is generated by an infinitesimal translation @xmath108 and reflection @xmath288 .",
    "the action of these operators on the low - energy electrons is given in terms of the pauli matrices : @xmath289 note that these two groups commute with each other , unlike true translation and reflection .",
    "in the presence of the appropriate symmetry breaking these are reduced down to the @xmath290 group discussed in the text . in this case",
    "the continuous translations and rotations @xmath291 become discrete with @xmath292 and the inversions @xmath288 and @xmath286 become @xmath293 and @xmath294 of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] respectively .",
    "the @xmath295 is the group of spin rotations , which is decoupled from the physical rotations because there are no spin - orbit interactions .",
    "it is generated by rotations @xmath296 .",
    "the high symmetry axis of any phase will always chosen to be z. infinitesimal rotations around the @xmath297 axis are represented by @xmath298 .",
    "there are also reflections and inversion of the spin space , but these do not distinguish any phases , so we will suppress them .",
    "this defines the symmetry group @xmath270 fully .",
    "a further enlarged symmetry group isomorphic to @xmath303 is considered at points in the body of the text [ see eq . ( [ eq : su(4)gen ] ) ] and other works , but there is no reason to expect that this will every be an accurate approximation .",
    "we will proceed to categorize the phases according to the symmetry group @xmath270 .",
    "one may always collapse classification to obtain the distinct phases under the artificially enlarged symmetry groups .    in the following subscections we present the tables enumerating the possible symmetry breaking for the singlet , triplet , and superconducting phases each .",
    "each table is split into subsections corresponding to the irreps of @xmath304 .",
    "these are listed in the first column . at the beginning of each subsection",
    "the second column gives the order parameter ( op ) for the irrep in terms of the notation @xmath305 and arranges these into a vector .",
    "next to this are the generators of symmetries under which the order parameter is invariant ( generators and @xmath231 commute ) .",
    "this completely characterizes one dimensional represntations .    in the case of the multi - component representations ,",
    "particular values of the order parameter may have higher symmetries than the generic values - these are the distinct phases .",
    "the values of the order parameter that produce the phase are given according to the vector representation in the second column .",
    "next to these in the third column are the additional residual symmetries under which the phase is invariant , and the phase is labeled with the additional subscript .",
    "for example , let us take in section @xmath257 in the first table .",
    "the second column of first line defines a vector for the representation .",
    "the third column states that all vectors in that representation are invariant under the time @xmath300 time reversal operation .",
    "the next line says that when the vector is proportional to @xmath306 , i.e. @xmath307 , the symmetry is higher .",
    "the higher symmetries are in the third column ; in particular , this vector is invariant under the combined @xmath308 rotation and the @xmath309 reflection in addition to the @xmath300 rotation .",
    "the next line of the table says that when the vector takes the value @xmath310 the state is invariant under the reflections @xmath311 .",
    "note that each phase is generally defined by a coset of values of the order parameter , which are all invariant under conjugate groups .",
    "we only list one representative from each coset .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath257 , the @xmath306 vector is part of the coset of vectors @xmath312 , @xmath313 $ ] .",
    "these are all invariant under subgroups conjugate to the one listed in the third column .",
    "we use @xmath224 , @xmath314 as arbitrary real parameters when there is a continuous manifold of cosets . when listed under symmetries the symbols @xmath108 , @xmath285 , @xmath36 and @xmath298 mean the phase is invariant under the entire @xmath75 group generated .",
    "the symbol @xmath315 means the phase is invariant under all spin rotations .",
    "there are several symmetry operations involving rotations by @xmath268 or @xmath316 in one the @xmath75 groups . like the spin reflections , these",
    "do not distinguish any of the phases so we do not list them .",
    "five of the phases belonging to the @xmath257 representation are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gphasesfig ] .",
    "notice that , according to the landau theory , the transition to the @xmath257 -type phase can not occur directly but rather through the pattern with incommensurate periodicity .",
    "the normal phases are by definition invariant under spin and gauge transformation so we will suppress them .",
    "a product of pauli matrices acting in different sub - spaces should be understood as a direct product .",
