    "not only exponential separation rates but also the associated directions in tangent space , the so - called lyapunov vectors ( lvs ) , are required when trying to tackle many important aspects of stc , such as , for instance , the role of hydrodynamic modes  @xcite , extensivity properties  @xcite or predictability questions  @xcite , among others .",
    "random initial errors evolve in time and asymptotically align with the main lv corresponding to the most unstable direction . in practice , this limit is reached exponentially fast , so the memory of the initial perturbation is quickly lost .    in extended systems , the spatial distribution and correlations of lvs",
    "are crucial to deal with questions such as predictability  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of spatial correlations is particularly apparent in the context of weather forecasting ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "localization of lvs in several distributed systems has been noticed and discussed in some extent in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been termed dynamical localization of errors  @xcite : the main lv rapidly tends to concentrate around a narrow region of space . in homogenous systems , where all degrees of freedom are equivalent ,",
    "the localization locus is not anchored to any fixed site , but keeps moving all over the system . however , in the case of inhomogeneous systems lvs become strongly localized at certain fixed pinning centers and the phenomenon can be understood in terms of the problem of diffusion in quenched random potentials  @xcite .",
    "recently , the evolution of _ infinitesimal _ perturbations in spatially extended chaotic systems has been shown to be generically described by langevin - type equations with multiplicative noise  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable observation in many systems  @xcite is that , after a suitable logarithmic transformation , the statistical description of the dynamics of perturbations is captured by the prototypical stochastic surface growth equation of kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz )  @xcite . in the surface picture erratic fluctuations , due to the chaotic nature of the trajectory , are treated as an effective noise .",
    "the existence of short - range correlations , coming from the deterministic nature of the trajectory , are irrelevant for the scaling description of the surface statistics .",
    "it is only natural that the existence of long - range correlations  @xcite or a fat tail noise  @xcite may change the universality class observed .",
    "the surface picture has also been shown to be very useful to deal with the dynamics of _ finite _ perturbations in the presence of stc  @xcite .    in view of the successful description of the main lv as a nonequilibrium rough surface a question that naturally arises is to",
    "what extent can we describe lvs corresponding to other unstable directions in terms of surface roughening processes ? this is precisely the question we recently addressed in a rapid communication @xcite , and that we develop here for a variety of systems .",
    "in the existing literature one finds that the lvs are commonly defined as the vectors that appear as a byproduct of the standard gram - schmidt orthonormalization procedure to obtain the les .",
    "this is largely due to the popularity of benettin s algorithm  @xcite to compute the lyapunov spectrum in all kind of dynamical systems .",
    "however , these vectors do _ not _ point in the most unstable directions , but are forced to form an orthogonal set .",
    "this is not a minor point because these vectors lack the intended physical meaning , which ultimately renders the gram - schmidt vectors useless for many purposes .",
    "for example , when the @xmath0th gram - schmidt lv , @xmath1 , is left to evolve freely it will _ not _ grow exponentially with its associated le @xmath2 ( apart from the case @xmath3 ) ; instead , @xmath1 will generally collapse in the direction of the first lv .",
    "however if the same vector @xmath1 is integrated backwards in time it will shrink with exponent @xmath4 ( neglecting numerical round - off errors ) . not less important is the fact that gram - schmidt lvs depend on the scalar product convention used because it defines the orthogonalization condition .",
    "these important caveats have attracted renewed interest in the problem of finding the correct set of vectors that carry the dynamical information in systems exhibiting stc .",
    "recent work has focused on the properties of a different set of vectors  @xcite , the characteristic lvs ( also called covariant lvs ) , that are invariant under time reversal and covariant with the dynamics .",
    "this vector set is independent of the scalar product used and provides an intrinsic decomposition in tangent space which should correspond exactly with oseledec s splitting  @xcite .",
    "although the existence of the characteristic lvs is known since long  @xcite it has not been until recent times that efficient algorithms have been devised to compute them  @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that characteristic lvs carry important information about the real - space structure , localization properties and space - time correlations , which can be put in the form of a dynamical scaling of the associated rough surfaces .",

    "in this paper we study the spatiotemporal structure of the characteristic lvs in different model systems exhibiting stc .",
    "our aim is to analyze the spatial structure of the characteristic lvs .",
    "in particular , we wish to provide further verification of the previously reported scale - invariant properties of the lv surfaces ( to be defined below ) and its validity for systems that differ significatively from the special case of coupled - map lattices . here",
    "we analyze systems of very different nature , including a coupled - map lattice ( cml ) , the ( continuous - time ) lorenz  96 model , and a minimal stochastic partial differential equation ( pde ) .",
    "we show that the leading lvs ( corresponding to the largest les ) generically exhibit scale - invariant properties inherited from those of the main vector .",

    "pikovsky and politi proposed  @xcite this stochastic pde as the proper candidate for modeling the statistical features of the dynamics of freely evolving perturbations .",
    "therefore , the analysis of this model will show to what extent the observed scaling of characteristic lv surfaces is generic and model - independent in the context of stc .",

    "it is worth stressing here that the presence of short - range correlations in the noise term @xmath28 ( due to the purely deterministic nature of the fluctuations ) , is actually irrelevant for the statistical description in the long - wavelength limit , as already shown in the original work of pikovsky and politi  @xcite .",

    "the multiplicative langevin equation  ( [ mse ] ) can be seen as a stochastic field theory for the evolution of random errors in extended homogeneous systems .",

    "interestingly , the application of the hopf - cole transformation , @xmath34 , immediately maps the problem into the kpz equation for surface growth : @xmath35 which ultimately justifies why the log - transformed ( main ) lyapunov vector of many spatiotemporal chaotic systems is found to belong to the kpz universality class  @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting caveat concerning this mapping , which has not been noticed before in the context of stc .",
    "one can see that eq .",
    "( [ mse ] ) is invariant under the sign change of the field @xmath36 .",
    "however , the solutions of eq .",

    "asymptotically become either strictly positive or negative , ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , for long enough times @xmath38 for all @xmath39 ) .",
    "the reason for this symmetry breaking can be traced back to the mathematical properties of eq .",
    "( [ mse ] ) .",
    "the key observation is that the dynamics governed by eq .",
    "( [ mse ] ) can not produce new zeros of the field @xmath40 .",

    "the set of backward lvs is precisely the orthonormal set obtained using the standard gram - schmidt orthogonalization method to compute the les  @xcite .",

    "forward lv grows exponentially in the far future at a rate given by the corresponding le @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite for computing the first @xmath0 lyapunov exponents , via successive gram - schmidt orthonormalization of a set of @xmath0 vectors that evolve according to the linear equations in tangent space , has caused many authors to consider using the resulting orthonormal set @xmath54 , @xmath55 , as the lyapunov vectors . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the use of this set of vectors poses serious problems in certain applications .",
    "any of the @xmath5 backward lv tends to align exponentially fast with the first lv .",
    "this has to be avoided by the externally imposed orthogonalization , which ` resets ' the vector set every few time steps .",

    "however for @xmath60 , each @xmath98 has @xmath110 zeros , which can not be neglected when applying the hopf - cole transform .",
    "indeed , one can observe that @xmath112 , which indicates that there must be other terms contributing to the velocity of the @xmath0th lyapunov surface .",
    "as expected , the equality @xmath113 exactly holds in the singularity - free case @xmath3 .",
    "a detailed analysis using the discrete version of ( [ mse ] ) reveals that the stochastic pde governing @xmath114 is a kpz equation with singular ( and difficult - to - treat ) terms at the points where @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "the erratic motion of zeros is sub - diffusive : the position of the @xmath120th zero satisfies @xmath121 , and we find @xmath122 for the second lv and @xmath123 for the fourth lv from numerical simulations in a system of size @xmath84 .",
    "we have already shown  @xcite that at long wavelengths ( in the @xmath124 region ) surface correlations of characteristic lvs exhibit dynamic scaling .",
    "the analysis of coupled - map lattices shows a fast propagation of correlations at large scales with a dynamic exponent @xmath125 corresponding to a ballistic process ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "since zeros do not propagate ballistically , but sub - diffusively , we conclude that information propagation at long wavelengths is mediated by a different process .",

    "[ fig2](f ) ] that can be identified ( light gray traces in the plots ) as traveling objects in figs .  [ time](a ) and [ time](c ) .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics of the kinks is governed by the equation of the field @xmath69 , which can be written exactly inside a plateau region : @xmath128 the drift term , proportional to @xmath129 , would lead to the ballistic dynamics of the kinks with @xmath125 .",
    "this provides the mechanism for the ballistic propagation of correlations observed at long wavelengths .",
    "our numerical results with the stochastic model ( [ mse ] ) are particularly revealing since they explicitly show to what extent equations for growing surfaces can be used to describe stc .",
    "specifically , eq .  ( [ mse ] ) is invariant under multiplication by a constant , @xmath130 , which leads to the symmetry @xmath131 for the corresponding surface .",
    "this symmetry property leads to scale invariance of @xmath132  @xcite . as equations for infinitesimal perturbations are always of linear type , eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) , the symmetry @xmath133 is always fulfilled and , in turn , systems with stc will exhibit scale invariance of the associated lyapunov vector surfaces .",

    "the dynamics of perturbations would be governed by linear equations that might contain higher - order derivatives multiplied by possibly fluctuating coefficients @xmath134 : @xmath135 .",
    "contrary to the perhaps oversimplified stochastic model  ( [ mse ] ) , zeros can be created in this general situation ; for instance , if a drift term exists ( @xmath136 ) , or if @xmath137 can take negative values .",
    "nevertheless , the scaling behavior of such a system is expected to be correctly described by eq .",
    "( [ mse ] ) , because those model - specific terms are actually irrelevant in the sense of the renormalization group . in conclusion , the role of zeros is very important to understand the dynamics of ( [ mse ] ) , but how they are linked to structural properties of generic systems with spatio - temporal chaos remains an issue for future work .    in summary , in this paper we have studied spatiotemporal chaos in three qualitatively different ( non - hamiltonian ) systems . in all cases characteristic ( and backward ) lyapunov vectors exhibit very similar spatial structure . the @xmath0th hopf - cole transformed",

    "this set of eigenvectors , so - called _ backward _ lvs  @xcite , indicates the directions of growth of perturbations grown since the remote past with exponents @xmath2 .",
    "the backward lvs are precisely the orthonormal vectors obtained using the standard gram - schmidt orthogonalization method to compute the les  @xcite .    conversely the directions that will grow with exponents @xmath2 are indicated by the so - called forward lyapunov vectors @xmath155 .",
    "they constitute an orthogonal basis formed by the eigenvectors of the operator : @xmath156^{\\frac{1}{2(t_2-t_0)}}\\ ] ] as with the backward lvs , the gram - schmidt procedure can be used to obtain forward lvs , but now going backwards in time and using the transposed jacobian matrices because of the identity @xmath157\\mathrm{\\mathbf{t}^*}[{\\bm u}(t_0 + 1)]\\ldots \\mathrm{\\mathbf{t}^*}[{\\bm u}(t_2)]$ ] .",
    "as noted by legras and vautard @xcite , the use of the transposed jacobian ( in contrast with the inverse ones ) causes the forward lvs to come up with the standard ordering .",
    "this means that to obtain the first @xmath0 forward lvs we need to integrate only @xmath0 perturbations ( instead of @xmath158 ) .",
    "finally , note that computing forward lvs requires to store a trajectory @xmath159 .",
    "each backward ( resp .",
    "forward ) lv grows with its exponent @xmath160 ( resp .",
    "@xmath161 ) when it is left to evolve in the limit @xmath162 ( resp .",
    "@xmath163 ) .",
    "however both sets , backward and forward , do not follow their associated exponents when the time limit is reversed .",
    "for this reason it is much more interesting to consider another set of vectors @xmath164 , the so - called _ characteristic _ lvs , that grow with exponent @xmath2 ( -@xmath2 ) when integrating to the far future ( past ) : @xmath165    the @xmath0th characteristic lyapunov vector is a linear combination of the first @xmath0 backward lyapunov vectors   on @xmath166 with @xmath167 would dominate the backward integration ( @xmath168 ) . ] : @xmath169 @xmath170 does not project on the subspace spanned by the @xmath171 first forward lvs .",
    "this allows , by means of some algebraic transformation @xcite , to express the coefficient vector @xmath172 as the one - parametric family of nontrivial solutions of @xmath173 where the @xmath174 matrix @xmath175 is calculated using the first @xmath171 forward lvs : @xmath176 @xmath177 is then completely determined ( up to a global sign ) imposing normalization of @xmath170 ."
