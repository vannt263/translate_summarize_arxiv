    "_ note added._after finishing this study and as we were preparing the manuscript , the belle collaboration announced evidence for @xmath166 decays  @xcite . the signal purity is close to 100% when the @xmath28 invariant mass is within the @xmath7 mass region , as assumed in our study .",
    "the results are still limited by small statistics ; using the measured branching fractions of the @xmath166 decay within and below the @xmath7 mass region , we find that the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry of @xmath167 is still allowed . the same paper also reports @xmath168 , which is smaller than the current world average .",
    "we repeat the fit procedure described in this letter with the above branching fraction . although the smaller value for @xmath85 results in the smaller number of signal events , the @xmath0 asymmetry from the interference between the resonant and the new - physics amplitudes becomes larger .",
    "we find that the change in @xmath85 does not largely affect the significance ; the difference is less than 10% for @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "<S> we present a novel method to search for a new @xmath0-violating phase in the @xmath1 transition using @xmath2 decays , where @xmath3 represents a final state with a specific strange flavor such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> direct @xmath0 violation can be enhanced due to an interference between an amplitude beyond the standard model ( sm ) and the sm decay amplitude through the @xmath7 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath0 asymmetry can be as large as 0.4 within the present experimental bounds on the @xmath8 transition . </S>",
    "<S> these decays provide a very clean experimental signature and the background is expected to be small in particular at @xmath9 @xmath10 factories . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation study for the @xmath11 decay shows that the statistical significance of @xmath0 violation can exceed 5 standard deviations with @xmath12 @xmath10 mesons .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 decay , direct @xmath0 violation , new physics 11.30.er , 12.15.ff , 13.25.hw    the phenomenon of @xmath0 violation is one of the major unresolved issues in our understanding of elementary particles today . in the standard model ( sm ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 violation arises from an irreducible complex phase , the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase  @xcite , in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) weak - interaction quark mixing matrix  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of direct @xmath0 violation in the neutral @xmath13 meson system  @xcite and mixing - induced @xmath0 violation in the neutral @xmath10 meson system  @xcite strongly support the km mechanism . despite this success , </S>",
    "<S> additional @xmath0-violating phases are inevitable in most of theories involving new physics ( np ) beyond the sm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of them allow large deviations from the sm predictions in @xmath10 meson decays . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such theories include supersymmetric grand - unified theories with the see - saw mechanism that can accommodate the large neutrino mixing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is of fundamental importance to measure @xmath0 asymmetries that are sensitive to the difference between the sm and np . </S>",
    "<S> additional sources of @xmath0 violation are also highly desirable to understand the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe ; detailed studies have found no way that @xmath0 violation in the sm alone could explain the baryogenesis  @xcite . many methods to search for a new source of @xmath0 violation in @xmath10 meson </S>",
    "<S> decays have been proposed until now . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most promising ways among them is to compare the mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetries in the @xmath14 decay  @xcite , which is dominated by the @xmath8 transition that is known to be sensitive to possible np effects , with those in the @xmath15 decay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements by belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite collaborations yield values smaller than the sm expectation ; a difference by 2.6 standard deviations is obtained when two results are combined . </S>",
    "<S> the other charmless decays @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are mediated by @xmath8 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 transitions , also provide additional information  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present world average with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 combined is different from the average with @xmath15 and related modes by 3.1 standard deviations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible implications of these measurements are discussed in the literature  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel method to search for a new @xmath0-violating phase in the hadronic @xmath23 transition using @xmath24 decays  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 represents a final state with a specific strange flavor such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these non - resonant direct decay amplitudes are dominated by the @xmath1 transition . a contribution from the @xmath26 transition followed by rescattering into @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be small because of the ckm suppression and the ozi rule  @xcite . in these decays , when the invariant mass of the @xmath28 system is within the @xmath7 resonance region , they interfere with the @xmath29 decay that is dominated by the @xmath30 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the decay width of @xmath7 is sufficiently large  @xcite to provide a sizable interference . within the sm </S>",
    "<S> , this interference does not cause sizable direct @xmath0 violation because there is no weak phase difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath30 transitions . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a np contribution with a new @xmath0-violating phase can create a large weak phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> thus large @xmath0 asymmetries can appear only from np amplitudes , and an observation of direct @xmath0 violation in these decays is an unambiguous manifestation of physics beyond the sm .    </S>",
    "<S> although the same argument so far is applicable to the @xmath31 decays , there is no guaranteed strong phase difference that is calculable reliably for these decays . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the breit - wigner resonance provides the maximal strong phase difference in the case of @xmath32 decays . </S>",
    "<S> violation that arises from interference between a resonant and a nonresonant amplitude was initially studied in top - quark decays  @xcite and in radiative @xmath33 decays  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charmonium width effect on the sm direct @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath10 decays was first considered in @xmath34 decays  @xcite and was also used in subsequent theoretical studies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , an evidence for the decay @xmath35 was first reported by the cleo collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently belle  @xcite has also reported the first observation of the @xmath36 decay . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that other modes such as @xmath37 will also be seen with a similar branching fraction , so that we will be able to study semi - inclusive @xmath38 transitions experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - inclusive branching fraction of @xmath38 is not yet measured , but is theoretically expected to be comparable to the branching fraction of the semi - inclusive decay @xmath39  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive the rates and the asymmetry of the decays @xmath32 based on the formalism described in the study of @xmath34 decays  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of two @xmath40 s is determined with two kinematical variables ; one is the invariant mass of the @xmath41 system , @xmath42 , and the other is the angle @xmath43 between the @xmath10-meson momentum and the momentum of one of two @xmath40 s in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath41 system . to have the interference between resonant and direct amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath42 should be in the @xmath7 resonance region . to be specific , </S>",
    "<S> we require in this study that the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath7 mass ( @xmath44 ) should satisfy @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the the width of the @xmath7 resonance  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the differential decay rate normalized with the total @xmath33 decay rate is then given by the following equation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the resonant amplitude , @xmath49 is the direct amplitude of the @xmath24 decay , @xmath50 is the total @xmath10 decay rate , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    the resonant amplitude @xmath48 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a product of the weak decay amplitude of @xmath38 and the real part of the @xmath7 decay amplitude to @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct amplitude @xmath55 is separated into contributions from the sm , @xmath56 , and from np , @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a real part of the sm direct amplitude , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is a strong phase difference between the resonant amplitude and the sm ( np ) direct amplitude , @xmath62 is a real part of the np amplitude and @xmath63 is a new @xmath0-violating phase . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath64 holds , direct @xmath0 violation can also occur from an interference between the sm and np direct amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we do not take this case in our study and assume @xmath65 in the following discussion .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the decay rates of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 similarly the sum of two decay rates is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the amplitude ratio of np to the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath71 dependence of @xmath72 reflects the spin components of the @xmath28 system , which can be determined at @xmath10 factories in the future from the differential decay rates in the mass - sideband region below the @xmath7 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> although only a pseudo - scaler component in the direct transition interferes with the @xmath7 resonance , the effect of other components can be estimated by such a measurement . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for simplicity , we assume that the direct transition is dominated by a pseudo - scaler component and ignore the @xmath71 dependence of @xmath72 in the following discussion .    the maximum asymmetry is realized when @xmath73 is satisfied . assuming that @xmath60 is small following the discussion by eilam , gronau and mendel  @xcite , the differential partial rate asymmetry is @xmath74 as a measure of @xmath0 violation , we define the following @xmath0-asymmetry parameter : @xmath75 the numerator of @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed with the branching fraction of the resonance ( @xmath77 ) and that of np in the resonance region ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 the inclusive branching fraction @xmath82 has not been measured and only an upper limit of 0.9% is available  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we take theoretical expectations that range from 0.3% to 0.7% , depending on the estimation of the ratio of @xmath83 to @xmath84  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath85 , we take the present world average of ( @xmath86%  @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is no direct experimental bound on the @xmath2 decay ( see _ note added _ in the end of this letter ) . </S>",
    "<S> a bound on the @xmath88 decay ( @xmath89 at 90%c.l . ) is available  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the search , however , was devoted only for energetic @xmath40 mesons above @xmath90  gev/@xmath91 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the momentum of @xmath40 mesons in the @xmath2 decay is lower ; it should be less than 2.2 gev/@xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> consideration on other experimental bounds also leads to a weak limitation on @xmath92  @xcite ; @xmath93% is still allowed , while the estimation of @xmath94 within the sm is @xmath95%  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since there is no reliable way to calculate the hadronic matrix element of the multi - body decay @xmath2 , we use an event generator that is based on the lund fragmentation model  @xcite for the estimation of @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> we start from the @xmath97 transition that mainly produces soft @xmath40 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is possible to assume @xmath98% without conflicting the existing experimental results such as the branching ratio of the exclusive @xmath99 decay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the default value of the @xmath100 popping probability in jetset7.4  @xcite , which is consistent with the ratio of the branching fractions between @xmath101 and @xmath102  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath96 to be @xmath103 for @xmath104% . </S>",
    "<S> estimations of the corresponding branching fraction within the sm typically yield smaller values than this estimation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the branching fraction of @xmath88 is expected to be around @xmath105 . with an additional @xmath100 popping and with the aforementioned simulation , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath106 in the @xmath7 mass region . also from the expected @xmath94 in the sm </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath108 holds for @xmath104% . note that , even in this case , an observation of non - resonant @xmath2 decays in the @xmath7 mass sideband region alone can not establish physics beyond the sm because of the difficulty in estimating branching fractions of multi - body hadronic decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of the denominator of @xmath76 is straightforward with the estimations mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the following result for @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 a large @xmath0 asymmetry of 0.4 is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is roughly proportional to @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it can be sizable even with @xmath113 ; for example , @xmath114 0.1 is allowed for @xmath115 .    a @xmath0 asymmetry proportional to @xmath116 ( @xmath117  @xcite ) may arise within the sm due to an interference between the resonant amplitude and a sm contribution from the @xmath26 transition followed by rescattering into @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is expected to be small since the @xmath26 decay amplitude is ckm - suppressed , and the rescattering amplitude is also suppressed by the ozi rule . from the measured branching fractions for @xmath118 and @xmath119 </S>",
    "<S> together with the additional @xmath120 suppression , where @xmath121 is the sine of the cabibbo angle  @xcite , the fraction of the @xmath26 transition in the @xmath118 decay amplitude is estimated to be @xmath122 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . using this information and with a modest assumption on a rescattering amplitude ratio @xmath123 from the ozi rule </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the @xmath0 asymmetry to be less than 0.9% . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the @xmath0 asymmetry within the sm is most likely below 1% .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform monte carlo simulation for the @xmath11 decay and estimate statistical errors on the @xmath0 asymmetry parameter . for this decay mode , the background level is expected to be small enough to be neglected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction efficiency and the @xmath28 mass resolution are estimated using a geant - based detector simulator for the belle detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath124300 events for @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the number of charged @xmath10 mesons recorded by a detector . </S>",
    "<S> we perform an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit to the differential decay rate distribution , which is proportional to @xmath127 , instead of integrating the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the following two free parameters in the fit : @xmath128 and @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath130 is the @xmath0 asymmetry in the breit - wigner term . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath131 is proportional to the branching ratio of the non - resonant @xmath11 decay below the @xmath7 mass region . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical error for @xmath130 is estimated to be @xmath132 . figure .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tnpvsr2 ] shows the 5@xmath133 search regions for @xmath125 ( dotted line ) and for @xmath134 ( solid line ) , which will be accessible at next - generation high - luminosity @xmath9 @xmath10 factories . </S>",
    "<S> direct @xmath0 violation will be observed in a large parameter space above a 5@xmath133 significance .    </S>",
    "<S> the new @xmath0-violating phase @xmath63 also affects time - dependent @xmath0-violating asymmetries @xmath135 in @xmath20 and related decays . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath136 is the mass difference between the two @xmath137 mass eigenstates , and @xmath138 and @xmath139 are parameters for mixing - induced @xmath0 violation and direct @xmath0 violation , respectively . ignoring a strong phase difference between the amplitude of np ( @xmath140 ) and sm ( @xmath141 ) , we obtain @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an amplitude ratio of np to the sm and @xmath144 is one of the angles of the unitarity triangle . in particular , a difference in @xmath138 between @xmath20 and @xmath15 decays , i.e. @xmath145 , would be a clear signal of the new phase since @xmath146 is held to a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we define expected statistical significance of the deviation from the sm by @xmath147 for the @xmath11 decay and by @xmath148 for the @xmath20 decay , where @xmath149 is an expected statistical error of @xmath150 extrapolated from the latest result by the belle experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath151 is not necessarily equal to @xmath152 , both decays are governed by the same @xmath8 transition . therefore it is reasonable to choose @xmath153 for comparison . figure .  </S>",

    "<S> the significance for @xmath156 largely depends on the sign of @xmath63 , which is not the case for the @xmath11 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the sign dependence arises from an asymmetric range for @xmath156 ; to a good approximation , we have @xmath157 where @xmath158  @xcite . therefore the @xmath11 decay plays a unique role in searching for a new @xmath0-violating phase .    in the above estimation , we use parameters that have uncertainties . however , they can in principle be measured precisely if a sufficient number of @xmath10 mesons are produced . in our estimation , we assume efficiencies and background levels that have been achieved with the belle detector at the kek @xmath10 factory . </S>",

    "<S> the technique to reconstruct @xmath3 , which has been successfully adopted for the measurements of semi - inclusive @xmath159 transitions  @xcite , can be used for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> flavor - specific neutral @xmath10 meson decays , such as @xmath160 , and other charmonia such as the @xmath161 decay can also be included . </S>",
    "<S> the method proposed in this letter is also applicable to other beauty hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> examples include @xmath162 and @xmath163 .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have investigated @xmath2 decays as a probe for a new @xmath0-violating phase in the @xmath1 transition . </S>",
    "<S> large @xmath0 violation may arise from an interference between @xmath164 and a contribution of the physics beyond the sm to the non - resonant decay @xmath165 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the direct @xmath0 asymmetry can be as large as 0.4 </S>",
    "<S> . the experimental signature will be very clean in particular at @xmath9 @xmath10 factories ; when @xmath12 charged @xmath10 mesons are available , the statistical error on the @xmath0 asymmetry parameter is estimated to be @xmath1240.06 . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical significance of @xmath0 violation in the @xmath11 decay can exceed 5 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> an even better sensitivity will be expected by including other final states . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that this result is comparable to the expected sensitivity with mixing - induced @xmath0 violation in the @xmath20 decay . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath2 decays will be useful to search for @xmath0 violation beyond the sm in the @xmath1 transition at high - luminosity @xmath9 @xmath10 factories . </S>"
