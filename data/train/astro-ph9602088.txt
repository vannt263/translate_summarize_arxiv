    "how different are the colors of bulges and disks of spiral galaxies ? according to the population paradigm , disks of spirals , containing population i stars , are bluer and younger than bulges , the latter made up of population ii stars .",
    "also , the widespread belief that bulges are metal rich ( eg . rich 1988 ) supports the notion that bulges are redder than disks .",
    "this notion needs to be reexamined in the light of the following : ( 1 ) we find that bulges of early - type spirals are not metal rich ; their mean metallicities are rarely above solar ( balcells & peletier 1994 , hereafter bp94 ) .",
    "also the metallicity of our bulge nowadays is estimated to be just above solar ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the inner parts of disks are often very dusty ( valentijn 1990 , peletier 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , integrated colors ( and colors derived from ellipse fitting , see section [ data ] ) trace reddening as much as population characteristics .",
    "( 3 ) colors have become useful age diagnostic tools with the realization by frogel ( 1985 ) that the combination of optical and near - infrared ( nir ) color indices allows to partially disentangle age and metallicity .",
    "( 4 ) integrated colors include contributions from bright , localized , blue star forming regions .",
    "the colors of the underlying disk contain information on the age of the older components of the disk population .",
    "excluding regions of ongoing star formation and regions with significant reddening from the color determinations was not possible with aperture photometry , but can now be done using two - dimensional digital photometry and modern data processing techniques .",
    "the recent availability of large - format two - dimensional near - infrared detectors allows the determination of nir color profiles without the limitations of studies based on nir aperture photometry data . in this paper",
    "we analyze @xmath4 surface photometry of a sample of early - to - intermediate type , inclined disk galaxies .",
    "this work is part of a larger study of optical and nir colors of disks and bulges ( peletier & balcells , in preparation ) .",
    "here we highlight that the colors of bulges and disks are very similar .",
    "indeed , contrary to what would be expected if bulges are indeed redder than disks , bulges do not appear as distinct morphological components in color index maps derived from optical and nir images .",
    "we find long dust lanes to be the main morphological component of the color maps .",
    "a few galaxies show additional features such as nuclear spots of redder color with a size smaller than the bulge , and progressive bluing in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "color variations from galaxy to galaxy are much larger than color variations within each galaxy .",
    "to put this result in a more quantitative footing , we work with color profiles of disk and bulge determined in a way which minimizes the effects of dust reddening .",
    "our results , from accurate near - infrared array measurements , show that color differences between bulges and disks are very small .",
    "age determinations derived from optical and nir color - color diagrams with the use of simple population models indicate that the bulk of the ( inner ) disk and bulge stars are essentially coeval . at most ,",
    "disk stars are 2 - 3 gyr younger than bulge stars .",
    "we disagree with the conclusion of bothun & gregg ( 1990 ) that disks are bluer than bulges by @xmath5 .",
    "our sample consists of inclined galaxies ( i @xmath6 50 ) , of galaxy type s0 to sbc .",
    "the sample comprises the 30 galaxies of table 1 of bp94 , except for the two that were outside the declination range of ukirt .",
    "the optical colors of the bulges have been analyzed in that paper . in short ,",
    "the optical data consist of u , b , r and i surface photometry , obtained with a 400@xmath7590 eev ccd chip at the pf camera of the 2.5 m int telescope at la palma . the pixelsize was 0.549  , and the effective seeing on the images lies between 1.2  and 1.6  .",
    "the images were taken under photometric conditions , and flatfielding was accurate to about 0.2% .",
    "the colors were corrected for galactic extinction ( bp94 ) .",
    "we obtained near - infrared images for this sample at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) using ircam3 ( puxley & aspin 1994 ) , an infrared camera equipped with a 256 @xmath7 256 insb array .",
    "the camera gives a pixel size of 0.291 arcsec and a field of 75 arcsec .",
    "cosmetically , the array is very clean , with less than 1% bad pixels . for every object we took images in 10 positions , of several readouts each , making up a total integration time of 100s per position .",
    "the object was moved around on the chip on 6 of these exposures , while 4 consisted of blank sky , about 10 arcmin away from the galaxy .",
    "the frames were flatfielded using median sky flat fields , and mosaics were made aligning the individual frames .",
    "the effective seeing on the final frames was between 0.8  and 1.0  .",
    "the frames here were also taken under photometric conditions , with errors for individual stars of @xmath00.03 mag .",
    "comparison with aperture photometry shows that the maximum zero point errors are 0.1 mag in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "all galaxies were observed in @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , 20 galaxies were also observed in the @xmath8-band . in fig .",
    "[ plate ] we show real - color urk - images for this sample . to make the images we first calibrated the frames in each band photometrically , and then aligned the three images using the positions of stars .",
    "[ plate ]    .",
    "[ coltab ] colors of bulges and disks [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     color profiles for bulges and disks were obtained by measuring surface brightness profiles on each band along wedge - shaped apertures . for the bulge profiles ,",
    "wedges were 22.5  wide , centered on the disk semi - minor axes as determined by elliptical fits to the galaxy s image .",
    "in galaxies with prominent dust lanes , only the semi - minor axis away from the dust lane was used for subsequent analysis .",
    "otherwise , we took the mean of the two profiles .",
    "details on the method are given in balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) .",
    "the disk surface brightness profiles were measured along 10-wide wedge apertures centered 15  away from the disk major axis , as determined in the @xmath9-band image .",
    "we chose these apertures so as to avoid measuring over the prominent dust lanes near the major axis of inclined galaxies .",
    "we thus measure the light of the disk on the far side of the galaxy which is not extincted by the dust on the near side of the disk .",
    "the color profiles could be slightly affected by any vertical disk color gradients for inclinations above 80 .",
    "we chose the wedge - aperture method of determining color profiles over the more common method of integrating azimuthally along best - fit ellipses ( terndrup 1994 ; peletier 1994 ; de jong 1995 ) . for galaxies at high inclinations , such as those in our sample , the two methods give very different results .",
    "the difference is higher for galaxies with redder colors , a sign that the dust is responsible for the observed differences .",
    "the effects of dust in the wedge color profiles can be estimated from the amplitude of the disk color gradients in various bands . for our sample ,",
    "dust effects appear to be small for galaxy types up to sab and for some sb s .",
    "colors in bulges and disks become bluer radially outward ( de jong , 1995 ; bp94 ) .",
    "gradients are small enough however that we assign representative values for the color of each component . for bulges ,",
    "we take the color at 0.5@xmath10 or at 5  arcsec , whichever is larger . for disks we use the colors at 2 major axis @xmath9-band",
    "scale lengths .",
    "these colors are tabulated in table  1 .",
    "we find that disk colors , while somewhat bluer , are very similar to bulge colors for all the galaxies ( see fig .  [ buldiscol ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ buldiscol ] , the diagonal line indicates the locus where both colors are equal .",
    "the average differences between disk and bulge colors are 0.126 @xmath11 0.165 for @xmath12  @xmath13 , 0.045 @xmath11 0.097 for @xmath14  @xmath13 , 0.078 @xmath11 0.165 for @xmath13  @xmath9 and 0.016 @xmath11 0.087 for @xmath8  @xmath9 ( @xmath8  @xmath9 colors are only available for 20 of the 30 galaxies ) .",
    "larger deviations tend to occur at the blue end of each distribution .",
    "this region of the diagrams is occupied by low - luminosity , late - type galaxies .",
    "note that the average difference between bulge and disk color is three times smaller than the one reported by bothun & gregg ( 1990 ) for s0 s .",
    "since color gradients in these bulges and inner disks are small ( bp94 , peletier & balcells , in preparation ) this result does not critically depend upon the place where the colors are measured .",
    "terndrup ( 1994 ) also show that @xmath15 colors of bulges and disks are not very different .",
    "the average @xmath15 difference between their bulge and disk color is 0.21 mag , slightly larger than what we find .",
    "the interpretation of this number however is much more difficult for their sample , since it is unclear how much their colours are affected by extinction .",
    "we now put the information contained in fig .",
    "[ buldiscol ] as a blue vs. infrared color - color diagram .",
    "figure  [ urk ] shows the @xmath12@xmath13 vs. @xmath13@xmath9 diagram for bulges ( circles ) and disks ( asterisks ) .",
    "dashed lines connect the bulge and disk for each galaxy . on the sides ,",
    "histograms are given for the @xmath16 and @xmath15 colors of the galaxies .",
    "figures  [ buldiscol ] and [ urk ] show that the colors of the stellar populations of bulges and inner disks are very similar .",
    "this is true for the bluest galaxies , as well as for the other , redder , galaxies .",
    "the distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath15 are not identical though , as shown in the histograms to the right and to the top of fig .",
    "[ urk ] ( bulges : solid lines . disks : dotted lines ) .",
    "the @xmath16 distributions are clearly different , in a ks sense .",
    "the @xmath15 distributions are undistinguishable in a ks test except for a blue tail in the color distribution of disks .",
    "can we use the color similarity to put limits on the age differences between bulges and disks ? in fig .",
    "[ twogrid ] we show the color - color data of fig .  [ urk ] together with single age - metallicity stellar population models by worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1995 ) . along the solid lines ,",
    "metallicity varies , while age varies along the dotted lines .",
    "it is clear that there are large differences between the color predictions of both models .",
    "color and metallicity are partially disentangled in the models of vazdekis and degenerate in those of worthey .",
    "such differences may be due to difficulties inherent to the modeling of @xmath12 and @xmath9 data . in the @xmath12-band , few stars are available to calibrate the models with . in the @xmath9-band ,",
    "model predictions are affected by uncertainties in the treatment of the later stages of stellar evolution , such as the agb ( see charlot 1996 for a discussion ) .",
    "vazdekis ( 1995 ) are not the first to claim that age and metallicity are separable using this diagram : this notion already appears in the models of bothun ( 1984 ) , peletier ( 1990 ) , and bressan ( 1994 ) .",
    "the agreement among the latter authors prompts us to use the vazdekis  models to analyze our data .",
    "color differences are so small however , that a separation of age and metallicity will not be attempted .",
    "instead , we use the models to see what age difference is implied by the color differences in the case of constant metallicity , and what metallicity difference is implied by the color differences in the case of constant age . in table  2 and 3 we give the difference in metallicity while keeping age constant , and the difference in age , while metallicity is left constant .",
    "the models used are the two mentioned above at z=0.02 and age=12 gyr , plus the models of rabin ( 1980 ) as given by oconnell ( 1986 ) .",
    "the latter models have been modified slightly using worthey s values , to convert @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 to resp .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",
    "table  2 shows again that there are large discrepancies between the 3 models .",
    "these show up especially in @xmath15 . on the average however , the models agree that one needs a difference of appr .",
    "0.10 in log  z , or 0.11 in log  t between bulge and disk . at an age of 10 gyr",
    ", this corresponds to a difference of 3 gyr .",
    "it is however much more likely that the difference in color is caused by both metallicity and age . in this case",
    "the age difference is smaller .",
    "we stress that these results apply to the inner parts of disks only .",
    "photographs of spirals often suggest that the outer parts are bluer , and perhaps the perception many people have about the blueness of disks really applies to the regions at large radii .",

    "for a given @xmath28 the @xmath27 of a disk is on the average 0.4 mag bluer than a bulge . here",
    ", we do nt find any systematic offset between bulges and disks , as they see for example in their fig .",
    "7 . to explain the discrepancy we can only point to the fact that their infrared ( jhk ) measurements are aperture measurements , where the aperture centers are not centered on the galaxy nucleus . making these measurements , and comparing them to ccd data",
    "is extremely complicated , since results depend for example on the response map of the aperture itself , the wings of the aperture , etc .",
    "( see e.g. peletier 1990 ) .",
    "an error of 0.5 mag seems plausible to us . for the s0 s in our sample",
    "we find that there is as much , or as little , star formation in the bulge as in the disk .",
    "our data put constraints on the eggen   ( 1962 ) model of galaxy formation by monolithic collapse with progressive enrichment of the galaxy .",
    "our ages make it unlikely that there has been a gap in time between the formation of the bulge and that of the inner disk .",
    "the formation of bulge and disk must have been a continuous process .",
    "this is the case for example in the continuous infall models of gunn ( 1982 ) , where the age of the stars is determined by the free - fall collapse time of the infalling gas . since",
    "this time - scale is almost equal for bulge and inner disk , no stellar population differences will be expected .",
    "the similarities in color between bulges and disks can be believed to stem naturally from models in which the bulge forms from instabilities in the disk ( pfenniger & norman 1990 ; combes et al .",
    "1990 ; pfenniger 1993 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case in the absence of starburst processes ; starbursts imply discontinuous changes which break the age and metallicity link between parent and daughter population .",
    "starbursts are likely to be necessary in order to build up the central space densities of bulges from disk material ; they may be unavoidable if the disk contains any gas .",
    "thus , our result does not necessarily support instability - driven bulge formation scenarios .    our result , that an important part of the disk is as old as the bulge , also means that , at high redshift , a considerable amount of gas must already have been transformed from gas into stars .",
    "we predict that the occurrence of `` naked bulges '' surrounded by large amounts of gas is unlikely at any redshift .",
    "the statistics of galaxies associated with damped lyman - alpha systems , still in low numbers , reveal the predominance of disk morphologies ( wolfe 1994 ) .",
    "how do color gradients in bulge and disk affect this result ? measured gradients in both bulges and disks are generally small ( bp94 , peletier & balcells 1995 , in preparation ) , so age or metallicity only differ by a small amount if another position in the bulge or disk is chosen .",
    "fisher ( 1995 ) report high values of color and line - strength gradients in s0 s .",
    "the difference with our data is that their systems are extreme edge - on galaxies .",
    "it appears that vertical gradients in bulges are large , contrary to radial gradients .",
    "we find that the color gradients in the inner effective radius of the bulges are small , and comparable in size to those in elliptical galaxies ( bp94 , peletier & balcells , in preparation ) , so the discrepancy with fisher  might be due to the fact that , owing to the almost perfect edge - on aspect , their measurements go further out .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that , consistently from 4 independent colors , we find that inner disks are only slightly younger than bulges .",
    "the difference in age in general lies somewhere between 0 and 3 gyr .",
    "we thank alexandre vazdekis for making his stellar population models available before publication and massimo stiavelli for help with the observations .",
