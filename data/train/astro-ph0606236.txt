    "mass loss in evolved stellar populations affects the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and mass loss from individual stars governs post main sequence evolution . the amount and duration of mass loss that occurs in giant",
    "stars remains one of the most uncertain parameters in stellar evolution theory and the effect of these processes on the inferences derived from stellar population models can be significant .",
    "given the wide use of these models ( e.g. , in inferring stellar masses of high - redshift galaxies ) , understanding the mass losing process is vital for a range of problems in astrophysics .",
    "although dust constitutes a small fraction of the total mass lost , it is frequently used as a marker as it is optically thin and its thermal emission is readily detectable in a variety of environments .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) , believed to have formed during the assemblage of the galaxy , are coeval samples of stars at common , well - determined distances with nearly uniform initial compositions .",
    "gcs enable study of the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium arising from mass ejection during the post - main sequence evolution of stars .",
    "red giant stars , especially those ascending the asymptotic giant branch , are expected to develop winds that inject processed material into the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) during post - main sequence evolution .",
    "these winds contain gas and solid phase materials , the latter in the form of dust grains that condense from the metals . however , detection of thermal emission arising from intra - cluster medium dust has been elusive , suggesting that the icm in gcs is 100 to 1000 times less massive than expected from current stellar evolution theory and observations of mass - losing stars in clusters and in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the circumstellar environments of stars in the late stages of evolution , when most mass loss occurs , are most effectively detected and studied in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "ir surveys conducted by _ iras _ , _ 2mass , _ and _ iso _ revealed populations of dust - enshrouded asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and red supergiant ( rsg ) stars in the galactic bulge @xcite , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite , and in galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "gcs are expected to contain dust from episodes of mass loss in red giant branch ( rgb ) and agb stars .",
    "the ir excess of their circumstellar dust emission is expected to peak between 20   to 30  , and thus photometry at wavelengths larger than 20   is necessary to estimate accurate dust masses lost by such stars .",
    "the amount of dust present in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) will vary depending on the cluster escape velocity , the time since last crossing of the galactic disk where the icm can be stripped away by the ism , and the number of mass - losing stars .",
    "in general the dust in the icm of gcs is expected to be @xmath4 to @xmath5 m@xmath1 for most galactic clusters .",
    "globular clusters have reasonably homogeneous ( in age and metallicity ) , well - understood stellar populations , so observations of icm dust are reasonably straightforward to interpret to yield mass loss rates and duty cycles .",
    "previous attempts to detect the icm in gcs suggest that the icm density is well below that expected from predictions of the mass loss input from rgb and agb stars , even considering the low metallicity of gcs .",
    "the lowest 3-@xmath6 upper limits to the icm mass for 70  k dust are @xmath7 m@xmath8 @xcite . detecting thermal emission from the elusive icm in gcs is observationally challenging .",
    "@xcite reported _ iso _ observations of the ir thermal emission from the winds of individual rgb stars in six massive gcs ( 47 tuc , ngc 362 , omega cen , ngc 6388 , m15 , and m54 ) showing that , in those systems , stellar winds from these stars are enriching the icm .",
    "though thermal emission from the icm material might be expected to be detectable , many attempts to do so with ir and millimeter observatories have produced only a single secure detection of icm dust , a tentative ( 3.5-@xmath6 ) detection of thermal emission in the core of the metal - poor gc m15 @xcite .",
    "overall this result suggests that the icm dust in gcs is significantly less massive than expected from current stellar evolution theory and observations of mass losing stars in gcs and the solar neighborhood .",
    "the causes of the paucity of icm emission have been proposed to be ram - pressure stripping of icm gas during galactic plane passage , blowout by nova explosions , fast winds from the stars themselves , radiative ejection by the sheer luminosity of cluster stars , and continuous ram - pressure from hot gas in the galactic halo .",
    "however , the dominant state of the icm is unclear .",
    "sensitive searches for neutral h in the icm at radio wavelengths have yielded upper limits @xmath9 0.1 m@xmath8 @xcite , with a possible detection of @xmath10 200 m@xmath8 in ngc 2808 @xcite and a 5@xmath6 detection of 0.3 m@xmath8 in m15 @xcite .",
    "perhaps much of the icm is ionized , as suggested by the high electron densities measured from pulsar timing in 47 tuc @xcite . however , h@xmath11 searches have as yet been unsuccessful .",
    "icm dust grains in radiative thermal equilibrium should attain temperatures of 50  k to 80  k because of the high energy density of starlight within a gc @xcite and thus be detectable as an ir excess ( above the photospheric emission ) in gcs at mid- to far - ir wavelengths . here",
    "we present observations of the galactic gc m15 with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , whose instrumental sensitivity enables detection of dust masses as low as @xmath12 m@xmath8 ( assuming a population of grains radiating in thermal equilibrium , with integration times down to the background confusion limit ) and therefore permits an unequalled opportunity to search for and set stringent limits on the `` missing '' icm .",
    "m15 ( ngc 7078 ) , with [ fe / h ] = -2.4 @xcite , is one of the most metal poor gcs .",
    "it is a well - studied cluster , as it is home to the first planetary nebula ( pn ) discovered in a gc ( k648 , also designated as ps-1 , @xcite ) and to the first gc low - mass x - ray binary source ( x2127 + 119 , @xcite ) .",
    "at least eight millisecond pulsars are also associated with the cluster @xcite .",
    "m15 is generally believed to be a core - collapse gc , with a small , dense core containing approximately 4000  m@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the reddening and the distance are updated from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "galactic coordinates for m15 are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , placing the cluster @xmath17 4.5  kpc south of the galactic plane .    the total dust mass expected in a gc can be estimated using the following equation :    @xmath18}}{100},\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the horizontal branch ( hb ) lifetime , @xmath20 is the number of hb stars , [ fe / h ] is the cluster metallicity , and @xmath21 is the dust mass lost from each star at the tip of the rgb .",
    "the factor of 100 is the solar gas - to - dust ratio , which is scaled for the metallicity of m15 by adding the [ fe / h ] factor . using values typical of population ii stars and this relationship ,",
    "the expected dust mass in m15 has been estimated to be 3.7 @xmath22 10@xmath23 m@xmath1 by @xcite and 2.0 @xmath22 10@xmath23 m@xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "m15 is also home to the pn k648 .",
    "k648 was the first globular cluster pn discovered , and subsequently it has been extensively studied at uv , optical and ir wavelengths to determine the chemical composition of the ejecta nebula and parameters of the central star @xcite .",
    "the study of post - agb stellar evolution in old metal - poor , low - mass stars in gcs or the galactic halo can be greatly enhanced if the by - products of stellar nucleosynthesis can be measured .",
    "enriched material produced in the rgb and agb stages of stellar evolution are dispersed into outer layers of the stellar system and subsequent mass loss processes lead to the formation of a pn .",
    "few pne in the galactic halo population have been identified and only four of these pne , including k648 , bb-1 , dddm  1 , and h4 - 1 are associated with globular clusters @xcite .",

    "the irac basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images were post - processed to correct for various instrumental artifacts and were mosaicked using the 2005 may 09 version of the ssc legacy mopex software @xcite .",

    "the diffuse icm is not detected in the irac mosaics , even at 8  .",
    "however , the planetary nebula ( k648 ) and several other dusty stellar objects become quite prominent at 8  .",
    "point source photometry was conducted using several stellar extraction routines including glimpsephot , daophot @xcite , and the astronomical point source extraction ( apex ) tool contained in the ssc mopex package .",
    "severe stellar crowding towards the cluster core in the irac bands made reliable point - response - function ( prf ) photometry challenging .",
    "the best photometric results ( 95% agreement to 2mass k - band fluxes ) were obtained by performing prf fitting on the bcd images with apex .",
    "array location dependent photometric correction weights were applied before prf fitting to minimize systematic error in the point source extraction flux .",
    "the images were then corrected with the background matching routine , and outliers were eliminated by the mosaicker .",
    "prfs were created for 3.6   and 4.5   data using the prf estimate routine provided in apex .",
    "at least twenty stars were chosen to make each prf in areas with the smallest amount of crowding .",
    "the prfs provided by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) that were made in - flight in january 2005 for 5.8   and 8",
    "are sufficiently over - sampled , so there was no need to create new prfs for these channels .",
    "probable point sources with fluxes at least 4-@xmath6 above the background were then identified and selected for extraction on coadded images that had been corrected for array distortion .",
    "final flux extractions were performed at these world coordinates positions on the corrected bcd images using prf subtraction .    after applying the appropriate photometric color correction (",

    "if we then assume that the majority of the stars we detect with _ spitzer _ are k0 giant stars , then our fluxes are consistent with 2mass k - band fluxes to within approximately 5% . to further check our photometric results , we compared the fluxes from thirty of the stars we detect to k - band fluxes from @xcite .",

    "the mips data analysis tool ( dat , @xcite ) version 2.96 was used to do the basic processing and final mosaicking of the individual mips images .",
    "in addition , extra processing steps on each image were carried out before mosaicking using programs written specifically to improve the removal of mips detector instrumental signatures . at 24   the extra steps",
    "included readout offset correction , scan mirror dependent flat fields , a scan mirror independent flat field , array averaged background subtraction , and exclusion of the bias boost images . at 70   the extra steps were column average subtraction and pixel time filtering both with the exclusion of the regions around the bright sources .",

    "their irac colors , however , indicate that it is more likely that they are agb stars that are approaching the end of the agb phase of their evolution @xcite .",
    "the stars blueward of the rgb can be explained by the absorption in the fundamental bands of co in the 4.5   band and sio in the 8   band .",

    "these stars are offset from the core in the same sense as ir1a , ir1b , and ir2 , and the distribution is less cusped than the visual light . since m15 is 13.2 gyr old @xcite , most stars currently on the agb have a zero - age ms mass of @xmath44  m@xmath8 .",
    "these stars will soon end their lives as white dwarfs of @xmath45  m@xmath8 , having lost approximately 0.3  m@xmath8 during their post - main sequence evolution .",
    "the loose spatial distribution of this population could therefore be due to mass segregation , in which lower - mass stars are displaced to the outer regions of the cluster due to their high velocities , leaving a preferential concentration of high - mass stars near the center of the potential well of the cluster @xcite .    the mips cmds ( fig .",

    "they are distributed around the cluster center at an average radius of approximately 3.3 , and their positions are biassed towards the southern side of the cluster , near ir3a , ir3b , and ir4 .",
    "mass segregation is most likely responsible for their locations at the fringes of the cluster .",
    "although m15 is one of the most massive galactic globular clusters , it is surprising to find many dusty objects , as the cluster metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath46 places it amongst the most metal - poor galactic globular clusters .",
    "dust forms from metal condensates and it is difficult to understand how dust grains can form at such low metal abundances .",
    "it is likely that the metals condensing to form dust are produced in the stars themselves and brought to the surface near the end of their evolution .",
    "the fact that dust production does not seem to be inhibited at metallicities 1% solar implies that stellar mass loss must already have contributed dust very early on in the evolution of the universe .",
    "dust observed at high redshift is usually believed to originate in supernovae explosions that result from core collapse in massive stars , but our observations suggest that at least some of the dust formed within the first few 100 million years may have been produced by stars of only a few solar masses ( e.g. ms lifetime from models by @xcite ) .",
    "various investigators @xcite suggest that dust grains can form more easily at low metallicity in carbon stars , as these stars produce carbon themselves . with less initial oxygen abundance to start with , it is easier for these stars to achieve c / o  >  1 in their carbon shells . with excess carbon available",
    "( after locking up equal amounts of c and o in co ) , formation of carbon - chain molecules from which dust grain condensation can proceed . however , although there is evidence for high molecular abundances in stellar atmospheres at low metallicity , dust production in these stars may be less efficient due to a lack of sic seeds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggests that the low optical depth in carbon stars in the magellanic clouds points against large dust - to - gas ratios at low metallicity .    for low - mass oxygen - rich stars , one would not expect this evolution to lead to effective dust production , as dredge - up only increases the c / o ratio and does not facilitate the formation of oxygen - rich dust grains . in any case , for oxygen - rich stars it is well established that nucleation sites must be available to condense dust grains onto @xcite .",
    "these seeds are likely to be tio or similar which include secondary elements that are not produced by the star itself .",
    "other s - process seeds , such as zr , may be dredged - up in the atmospheres of these stars , but the limiting factor for dust production with such seeds is the oxygen abundance , as more oxygen will be locked into co after dredge - up .",
    "unfortunately , our observations do not allow us to draw any conclusions as to the abundances of secondary elements in the mass - losing stars in m15 .",
    "the suspicion is that stars do adjust their structure until they finally can shed their mantles as demonstrated by k648 in m15 . from the analysis of spectra of gc giant stars , a picture is emerging in",
    "which metal - poor stars do become very cool while nonetheless exhibiting early - type spectra because the low metal abundances give rise to weak absorption .",
    "they may not form much dust , but they may still be able to form enough of it to drive a wind .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of 47  tucanae  v1 suggests typical silicate dust grains and a typical mass loss rate of 10@xmath47  m@xmath8  yr@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "although uv and optical line ratios derived for k648 from previous investigations provide constraints on relative abundance ratios , several important @xmath11-capture elements , such as s , ar , and ne , have ground configurations that produce only ir fine - structure .",
    "if lines from these ions are not observed and introduced into abundance models , the total abundance of these elements becomes uncertain @xcite .",
    "often , measuring emission line flux from [ ] @xmath4912.81  , [ ] @xmath4910.51  , and [ ] @xmath498.99  is observationally challenging from the ground .",

    "[ fig : pn ] ) enable us to estimate the emitted h@xmath50 flux directly .",
    "assuming case b @xcite , and adopting a @xmath53  k and density of @xmath54 @xcite we derived @xmath55  ergs  @xmath56  s@xmath48 and @xmath57  ergs  @xmath56  s@xmath48 from the pf@xmath11 and hu@xmath11 lines respectively using the intrinsic hydrogen emissivity ratios tabulated in @xcite .",
    "these two estimates are in reasonable agreement ( within the formal error ) with each other , considering there is an absolute photometric uncertainty of @xmath58 @xcite between the two spectral orders ( @xmath59   and @xmath60  ) .",
    "our average @xmath61 of @xmath62  ergs  @xmath56  s@xmath48 is in good agreement with previous observational estimates , especially those obtained with large apertures @xcite , and we will adopt this value in our abundance analysis .      the ratio of [ ] @xmath35   line flux to our derived average value of h@xmath50 was used to estimate the ne@xmath63/h@xmath63 abundance .",
    "we have adopted a collisional strength @xmath64(t ) = 0.283 ( appropriate for t@xmath65  k , @xcite ) and an @xmath66 value of @xmath67  s@xmath48 from the nist database and assumed an electron density of @xmath68  cm@xmath23 @xcite .",

    "we find a total ne / h@xmath86 and a ne / o @xmath87 adopting an o / h @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the relative sulfur abundance was computed in a similar manner as the neon abundance described in  [ sec : neona ] , although all relative populations were determined using the @xcite code .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "observation of [ ] was used to determine the s@xmath40/h@xmath63 population , while the optical fluxes reported by @xcite corresponding to h@xmath50 ( assuming @xmath89 ; @xcite ) were used to estimate the relative s@xmath81/h@xmath63 and s@xmath63/h@xmath63 abundances ( table  [ tab : k648abund ] ) .",
    "we find an upper limit to the total s / h of @xmath90 , which is @xmath91 lower than that inferred by @xcite .",
    "adopting an o / h @xmath92 @xcite , yields a s / o @xmath93 .",
    "our new estimates of the [ s / o]@xmath94 and [ ne / o ] = + 0.54 confirm that k648 is under - enriched in s as compared to o @xcite , while ne / o is enhanced with respect to solar .",
    "the ne enhancement is seen in other halo population pne , such as bb-1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that contamination of he - burning products by @xmath11-captures at high temperature could account for enhanced ne .",
    "@xcite , based on analysis of _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) _ faint object spectrograph _",
    "( fos ) spectra of the central star , suggest that the nebular shell was ejected by a low - mass he - burning progenitor that has subsequently undergone a late thermal pulse , perhaps similar to the evolution of objects akin to fg sge @xcite .",
    "our derived neon abundance using the fine structure line , suggests that dredge - up from the stellar core may be an important mechanism to pollute the expelled nebular materials from slowly evolving , young pne .      assuming that the diffuse emission detected in the _ spitzer _ images arises from icm material , we can compute a dust mass using the observed seds .",
    "the approximate temperature of the icm dust was derived by least - squares fitting a greybody model to the sed using fluxes measured in a 130.5 @xmath22 130.5 square arcsecond aperture centered at the same right ascension and declination coordinates in images at all wave bands .",
    "our choice of aperture size is equivalent to that used by @xcite to facilitate direct comparison .",
    "the large wavelength range of the _ spitzer _ sed enables us to distinguish between the contribution of a stellar blackbody ( peaking near 0.64   and dominated by k0 stars ) , and that of thermal radiating dust that generates an ir excess at wavelengths greater than 24  .",
    "use of a two - component model , incorporating a stellar blackbody that peaks near @xmath95  k and a dust blackbody that peaks near @xmath96  k , gives a rough fit to the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ; table  [ tab : obs_sf ] ) .",
    "the fit produces a large reduced @xmath97 value of 5.26 suggesting that the integrated flux within our aperture sums the emission from stars of many disperate spectral types not well - represented by a simple , single emissivity and temperature blackbody .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the fit is the effect of crowding in 2mass data .",
    "this could lead to oversubtraction of the background and overestimation of the flux densities @xcite .",
    "the mass of the icm was determined using the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dust is optically thin , which yields the following expression    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the distance to m15 in kiloparsecs ( table  [ tab : m15_params ] ) , @xmath100 is the dust absorption coefficient in @xmath101 g@xmath48 , @xmath102 is the planck function in cgs units , and @xmath103 is the dust temperature .",
    "@xmath104 at 70   is 691.2 @xmath32 61.1 mjy ( table  [ tab : obs_sf ] ) , and @xmath100 is taken from @xcite to be 56 @xmath32 11 @xmath101 g@xmath48 at 70  , assuming a standard mrn dust distribution @xcite and an ism - type composition consisting of graphite and silicate grains .",
    "we derive a total dust mass of @xmath0  m@xmath8 , which agrees within a factor of two compared to the value cited by @xcite of @xmath105  m@xmath8 , and is approximately 2 - 4 times smaller than the dust mass predicted by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the _ spitzer _ and _ iso _ calculated dust masses may be largely due to the different choice of @xmath100 , as the icm flux densities at 70   agree within the errors stated ( table  [ tab : obs_sf ] ) .",
    "@xmath100 is the most uncertain parameter in the dust mass estimate , as its value depends largly on composition and density assumptions .",
    "therefore , we note that @xmath100 could be up to an order of magnitude larger than the value we have invoked here .",
    "the diffuse emission from icm dust in m15 is located approximately 17 to the west of the cluster core .",
    "the paucity of diffuse dust toward the cluster center , where the gravitational potential well is steepest , is puzzling .",
    "one possible explanation for this asymmetry is a collection of millisecond pulsars ( psrs ) near the core of m15 @xcite .",
    "seven psrs are located within 17 of the core ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] ) , and the radiative environs associated with these objects could lead to destruction of dust grains by sputtering or other ablation processes and may also inhibit dust production in stellar winds .",
    "the psr nearest to the icm dust distribution observed in the mips image , psr2129 + 1210f , is located on the northeast outer edge of the 70   emission @xcite . if , on the other hand , each mass - losing star has contributed 0.15  m@xmath8 to the icm on average ( assuming that each star will lose 0.3  m@xmath8 over its entire lifetime ) , then we see that an icm dust mass of @xmath106  m@xmath8 corresponds to mass lost from @xmath1710@xmath107 stars .",
    "this suggests that the icm is short - lived , as this many stars will have passed through the agb superwind phase , defined as the phase in which the mass loss rate exceeds the nuclear burning mass consumption rate ( @xcite suggests @xmath108",
    "m@xmath8  yr@xmath48 for low - mass stars ) , in only @xmath10 10@xmath109  yr , which is much shorter than the cluster s relaxation timescale .",
    "the icm dust therefore can not be expected to have relaxed and assumed the global shape of the gravitational potential well .",
    "if this is the case , the offset of the dust cloud from the center of the cluster would not come as a surprise .",
    "sources of the icm dust include the post main sequence mass - losing stars identified in fig .  [",
    "fig : massloss ] .",
    "if we assume that the dust - to - gas ratio scales in proportion to metallicity during the superwind phase , as indicated by @xcite , then at the metallicity of m15 , a dust mass loss of 10@xmath110 m@xmath1  yr@xmath48 is expected @xcite . with this mass loss rate , we again find that the dust has been accumulating for approximately 1@xmath2210@xmath109 years , significantly shorter than the time between subsequent passages of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "this short time scale suggests that dust does not survive long in the icm .",
    "processes that could be responsible for removing dust from the icm include ram pressure by the galactic halo gas , radiation - driven outflow or photo - destruction .",
    "analysis of our _ spitzer _ image data on the core of the globular cluster m15 show strong evidence for the presence of intercluster medium ( icm ) dust in the cluster core , with a mass of @xmath111  m@xmath8 and with an equilibrium temperature of @xmath112  k. this is the first secure , high signal to noise detection of icm dust in a globular cluster .",
    "also present surrounding the core are populations of dusty agb and post - agb stars , along with the planetary nebula k648 . using irs spectral data , we have observed both the [ ] and [ ] fine structure lines in k648 and have derived abundance estimates .",
    "the unique capabilities of _ spitzer _ have enabled us to identify both the interstellar dust and the dust producers in m15 .",
    "this is surprising at such low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = -2.4 ) , and may have implications for dust production in the early universe .",
    "the mass of the icm dust in m15 suggests that it has been accummulating for @xmath113 years , which is a factor of ten shorter than the time since the last galactic plane crossing .",
    "the dust mass is also approximately 4 times smaller than the mass predicted by @xcite . both of these results imply that such dust does not survive long compared to its production rate , and is thus part of a stochastic process .",
