    "the presence of power - law behaviour in nature is such an extremely common phenomenon that considerable lore has now grown up concerning its genesis .",
    "one of the most common situations in which it occurs is in the presence of scale - invariant systems .",
    "such behaviour occurs , for instance , in any sort of thermodynamic system undergoing a second - order phase transition , and the behaviour of physical quantities ( such as susceptibilities ) in terms of the distance from criticality is typically given by a power - law : ( t - t_t_)^. second - order phase transitions are extremely well - described by statistical field theories .",
    "the associated technical machinery ( the renormalization group ) , is now so well developed that it is sometimes difficult to remember that second - order phase transitions are not the _ only _ route to power - law behaviour .",
    "the onset of power - law behaviour actually occurs at a much more primitive level , and can be analyzed directly in terms of the underlying differential equations .",
    "scale invariance is commonly thought to be synonymous with power - law behaviour .",
    "this is not quite correct : scale invariance is not enough to guarantee power - law behaviour , while power - law behaviour implies scale invariance only in the trivial sense that it is always possible to write down _ some _ scale - invariant differential equation .",
    "( but such a de does not necessarily have to describe a physical theory . ) in the present paper , we examine scale invariant theories and find one direct route to power - law behaviour .",
    "this formalism consists of transforming a scale invariant theory into its associated autonomous form@xcite and then determining the location of its fixed points .",
    "these fixed points will lead inexorably to a background solution that exhibits power - law behaviour . by expanding the system about its fixed point ,",
    "a linearized autonomous differential equation emerges , whose solution will exhibit _ different _ power - law behaviour .",
    "this naturally leads to two independent power laws : one for the background fixed point and a second one for the linearized deviations from the fixed point . combining both results",
    ", our formalism indicates that the complete general solution to the system will , over some limited region , have a frobenius - like power - series expansion .",
    "the usual frobenius series is one of the form y(x ) = x^p _ i=0^a_i x^i . with @xmath0 a natural number , and is suitable for exploring linear odes in the region of regular singular points . in the present context ,",
    "involving nonlinear des , the generalized frobenius - like series we encounter are generically of the form y(x ) = x^p _ i=0^a_i x^i .",
    "the exponent in the prefactor of this frobenius - like series ( @xmath1 ) is governed by the exponent associated with the fixed - point power - law background behaviour , while the power series is given in terms of exponents ( @xmath2 ) that are integer multiples of those arising in the linearized problem ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this type of expansion is essentially a modification of that given by liapunov s expansion theorem for autonomous des@xcite , wherein we have now back - tracked to give the expansion in terms of the original scale - invariant system .    as specific examples we apply this formalism to both newtonian and relativistic isothermal stars , where the relevant differential equations are equivalent to the exponential [ isothermal ] lane  emden equation and its relativistic generalization .",
    "the resultant frobenius - like power series generalize the approximate solutions found , for instance , by chandrasekhar@xcite and by harrison _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite , and provides significantly greater analytic information concerning their structure .",
    "this formalism is also applied to a more general star , where the equation of state need not be linear except in the core .",
    "both newtonian and relativistic stars are verified to undergo damped oscillations in the total mass , pressure and radius as the central density goes to infinity .",
    "these oscillations can accurately be described by a frobenius - like power series with complex exponents . the relevant exponents ( though not the numerical values of the coefficients ) drop out naturally from the linearized problem .",
    "this power law solution matches the behaviour observed in numerical calculations to great accuracy .",
    "in this section we lay down the basic foundations of the formalism .",
    "first , we define `` scale invariant '' , `` equidimensional '' , and `` autonomous '' , and present the appropriate substitutions to go from one form to another .",
    "a single @xmath4th - order differential equation is chosen as a model because of its simplicity , and then the formalism is extended to a system of @xmath5 coupled @xmath4th - order differential equations . after determining the existence of fixed points in the equation , the background solution is obtained .",
    "the differential equation is then expanded about its fixed points to obtain a second power - series solution near the fixed point ( linearized solution ) . combining both results ,",
    "a frobenius - like series solution is obtained in a neighborhood close enough to the fixed point .",
    "let us define scale invariant differential equations in the usual manner , as those which remain unchanged under the substitutions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a fixed but arbitrary parameter.@xcite equations that remain unchanged under the substitutions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is another fixed but arbitrary parameter@xcite , will be defined as equidimensional - in-@xmath12 .",
    "thus equidimensional equations can always be viewed as scale invariant equations corresponding to the particular value @xmath13 for the exponent .",
    "finally , autonomous equations will be defined as those equations which remain unchanged under the substitutions @xmath14 and @xmath10 , where @xmath15 is a third fixed but arbitrary parameter@xcite .",
    "this last condition is that of translation invariance in the independent variable @xmath12 .",
    "it is a standard result that it is always possible to transform scale invariant equations into equidimensional - in-@xmath12 equations through the following substitution@xcite [ eq:1 ] y(x ) = x^p w(x ) .",
    "it is also a standard result that we can transform equidimensional - in-@xmath12 equations into autonomous equations by substituting@xcite [ eq:2 ] x = e^t z(t ) = w(x ) , where @xmath16 is the new variable .",
    "let us first consider a @xmath4th - order scale invariant differential equation in a single dependent variable , [ scale ] f ( x , y(x ) , y(x ) , y(x ) ,  , ^n y(x)x^n ) = 0 , where the primes stand for differentiation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "we will write this as @xmath17 , but the presence of an appropriate number of derivatives should be inferred . now assuming this equation to be scale invariant ,",
    "let s apply equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) to make equation ( [ scale ] ) equidimensional - in-@xmath12 .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath18 become = ( x)^n = _ j=0^n n",
    "x^p - j w^(n - j)(x ) .",

    "_ j=0^n-1 ( t - j ) z(t ) ) , where the dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath27 is some arbitrary function of @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath28 is now translation invariant , since the substitution @xmath29 as @xmath30 leaves the equation @xmath24 ( based on setting the rhs @xmath31 zero ) unchanged .",
    "the only way this can be true is if we can factorize @xmath32 into an autonomous @xmath26 times some @xmath27 , yielding the lhs .",
    "our original scale invariant equation @xmath17 , that had become equivalent to the equidimensional - in-@xmath12 equation @xmath33 , has now become equivalent to the autonomous equation @xmath34 .",
    "we can of course also work backward and prove that for any autonomous - in-@xmath16 equation for the dependent variable @xmath35 the substitution @xmath36 ( that is , @xmath37 ) produces an equation that is equidimensional - in-@xmath12 with @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore for any value of @xmath1 the substitution @xmath39 results in a differential equation that is scale invariant . however , this scale invariant equation need not be equal to the physical differential equation that describes the system we are concerned with . without some additional information beyond the mere existence of a power law , there is simply not much one can say about the physics .        in order to obtain the background solution of the ode , we must look at the fixed points . let s assume that @xmath26 has a fixed point @xmath40 such that all derivatives of @xmath35 vanish at that fixed point , , |f ( z(t ) = z _ * , ^i z(t)t^i = 0 ) = 0 , where @xmath41 $ ] denotes any positive integer in that range .",
    "hence , a solution to the differential equation @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "tracing back all the substitutions we made , we obtain [ eq:4 ] y(x ) = x^p z _ * ( x , y(x ) ) = 0 . from this equation ,",
    "the power law behaviour is obvious .",
    "however , not all scale invariant equations possess fixed points . a scale invariant differential equation , whose associated autonomous equation _ does not _ have any fixed points , _ will not _ possess power - law solutions . refer to [ appe:1 ] for an explicit counter - example . in light of this",
    ", we can formulate the following theorem :    any first - order differential equation that is scale invariant _ and _ whose associated autonomous equation possesses a fixed point will have a _ background _ solution in the form of a power law [ equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) ] with exponent given by the scale invariant condition .",
    "let us linearize the autonomous equation by setting @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath40 is the fixed point and @xmath45 is a small perturbation about @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath34 reduces to |f(z(t ) ) = |f(z _ * ) +    linear approximation , we must have |f_1(z_1(t ) ) = 0 . but",
    "@xmath46 is an ode which is both autonomous and linear , and still retains its character as a @xmath4th - order differential equation .",
    "autonomous plus linear is a very powerful constraint , and in fact implies a differential equation with constant coefficients .",
    "that is , there is some polynomial @xmath47 such that the function @xmath48 satisfies |f_1(z_1(t ) ) p(t ) z_1(t ) .",
    "the standard technique@xcite for solving differential equations of this type is to insert a trial solution of the form @xmath49 .",
    "then the differential equation reduces to the simple @xmath4th - order polynomial p ( ) = 0 , which has at most @xmath4 distinct solutions . assuming for the time being that all roots are distinct",
    ", the general solution to the linearized autonomous equation is z_1(t ) = _",
    "i=1^n a_i ( _ i t ) . that is z(t ) = z _ * + _ i=1^n a_i ( _ i t ) + o(a^2 ) . in terms of the original variable @xmath18 [ theo:1 ] y(x ) = x^p .",
    "near the fixed point , we now see the presence of multiple power laws .",
    "the prefactor @xmath50 is governed directly by the scale invariant condition , while the subsidiary exponents arise from solving a polynomial equation based on the linearized approximation .",
    "we are now in a position to formulate the following theorem :    [ theo:5 ] any @xmath4th - order ordinary differential equation that is scale invariant _ and _ whose associated autonomous equation possesses a fixed point will have a linearized solution which is generically expressible in the form of a power law ( equation [ theo:1 ] ) in a neighborhood surrounding the fixed point .",
    "we can also enunciate a general rule of thumb : because the exponent @xmath1 ultimately arises from algebraic manipulations involving the physical dimensionalities of the various quantities present in the ode it is likely to be a rational number .",
    "in contrast the exponents @xmath51 , being solutions of a polynomial equation , will generically be irrational .    in the exceptional case where the roots of the polynomial @xmath52 are not distinct , then there are additional technical complications .",
    "let @xmath53 of the roots be distinct , and let @xmath54 with @xmath55 $ ] be the multiplicity of the @xmath0th distinct root .",
    "then we have @xmath56 and z_1(t ) = _ i=1^m _ j=1^g_i-1 a_ij t^i-1 ( _ i t ) . that is z(t ) = z _ * + _ i=1^m _ j=1^g_i-1 a_ij t^i-1 ( _ i t ) + o(a^2 ) . in terms of the original variable @xmath18 [ theo:6 ] [ e : logs ]",
    "y(x ) = x^p .",
    "thus logarithmic deviations from power law behaviour , while not generic , are certainly relatively easy to get  despite the lore based in statistical field theory and second - order phase transitions a logarithm is not necessarily the result of one - loop physics .",
    "logarithms can arise from causes as mundane as a repeated root in a linearized autonomous ode .",
    "going beyond the linearized approximation , in the vicinity of the fixed point , one can write the expansion more systematically as @xmath57 $ ] , where @xmath58 , in which case @xmath34 reduces to |f(z(t ) ) = |f(z _ * ) +    represents a second - order functional derivative of @xmath59 around the fixed point , which will be some messy quadratic differential operator with constant coefficients .",
    "this implies both |f_1(z_1(t ) ) = 0 , and |f_1(z_2(t ) ) = - |f_2(z_1(t),z_1(t ) ) .",

    "this is basically liapunov s expansion theorem , as discussed for instance by lefschetz@xcite .",
    "readers interested in additional mathematical rigour are directed to that reference .    near the fixed point",
    "our equation becomes , in terms of the original variables @xmath18 , [ theo:2 ] y(x ) = x^p _ m ^n a(m ) x^m .",
    "this type of series is frobenius - like in the sense that the prefactor @xmath50 will be governed by the background solution , while the exponents of the power series will be given by the linearized problem .",
    "hence , we can formulate the following theorem :    any @xmath4th - order ordinary differential equation that is scale invariant _ and _ whose associated autonomous equation possesses a fixed point will generically have a formal solution in the form of a frobenius - like power series ( equation ( [ theo:2 ] ) ) in a neighborhood close to the fixed point .",

    "previously , we also showed that any @xmath4th - order differential equation in a single dependent variable that is scale invariant can be put into its associated autonomous form by applying the substitutions described in equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it carries over that we can make the same kind of substitution in each equation of the system . after doing so",

    "as long as the equation of state at high densities is linear , then the analysis above implies that as the central pressure goes to infinity the core radius and core mass will undergo damped oscillations as a function of central pressure .",
    "once the core undergoes these oscillations , the envelope serves only to communicate this internal behaviour out to the stellar surface .",
    "thus the total mass and total radius will similarly undergo damped oscillations .",

    "we have also proved that after linearizing about these fixed points , the solution to the scale - invariant linearized system can also be written in the form of an independent collection of power laws .",
    "generically , these collections of power - law solutions can be combined to develop a frobenius - like series in a neighborhood surrounding the fixed point .",
    "we applied these ideas to several problems taken from astrophysics , such as static isothermal stars both in the newtonian and tov frameworks .",
    "we showed , both numerically and analytically , that in all the static cases the solution to the scale - invariant differential system associated with each example exhibits power - law behaviour as the star approaches the point of collapse .",
    "we also showed analytically that the damped oscillations in the pressure , mass and radius of a star , as the central density goes to infinity , can be represented as a frobenius - like power series , which is easily obtained by applying our formalism .    more generally , it would be advantageous to consider truly dynamical systems involving pdes in both space and time .",

    "we gratefully thank the washington university gravitation group for useful comments and support .",
    "caution must be exercised since not all scale invariant equations possess fixed points .",
    "a scale invariant differential equation , whose associated autonomous equation _ does not _ have any fixed points , will _ not _ possess power - law solutions . as an example",
    ", let s analyze what happens to the following relatively simple differential equation : [ countereg ] f(x , y(x ) ) - p y(x)x - f x^p-1 = 0 , where @xmath297 is a non - zero constant . this",
    "is easily verified to be a scale - invariant equation and the associated equidimensional - in-@xmath12 equation is f(x , w(x ) ) x^p ( w(x)x - fx ) = 0 .",
    "this factorizes to give f(t )    and it does not possess a fixed point since we are assuming that @xmath298 . the general solution for this differential equation is easily verified to be y(x ) = x^p ( f + a ) .",
    "note that the solution to our example will be a power law if and only if @xmath299 , regardless of the fact that our example is explicitly scale invariant for all values of @xmath297 . in conclusion ,",
    "scale invariance by itself does not guarantee that the solution to a scale invariant differential equation will exhibit power law behaviour .",
    "more complicated examples of this behaviour can easily be constructed , but this simple equation is already enough to make the point that scale invariance does not necessarily lead to power - law solutions .    however , if we impose _ both _ scale invariance and the constraint that the associated autonomous equation has fixed points , then the solution will certainly exhibit power law behaviour .",
    "in the theory of autonomous differential equations the existence of a fixed point is one of the simplest things one could wish for ; the next most complicated structure one might encounter is a limit cycle .",
    "suppose we start with a scale invariant differential equation and that the associated autonomous equation has a limit cycle rather than a fixed point .",
    "this means there is a special solution @xmath300 with a period @xmath301 such that z_*(t + n t ) = z_*(t ) n z. in terms of the equidimensional variables this implies w _ * ( ( n t ) x ) = w_*(x ) .",
    "that is , a limit cycle in the variable @xmath16 becomes a discrete self - similarity in the variable @xmath12 .",
    "similarly in terms of the original variable @xmath18 we obtain discrete power - law behaviour y(x ) = x^p w_*(x ) ; nz : y ( ( n t ) x ) = ( p n t ) y(x ) .",
    "this is not the classic power - law behaviour discussed previously , but is , in a sense , the next least complicated thing . as an example , let s consider the second - order differential equation f(x , y(x ) ) x^2 y(x ) - ( 2p-1 ) x y(x ) + p^2 y + ^2 y(x ) = 0 this is easily verified to be scale invariant with index @xmath1 .",
    "the associated equidimensional - in-@xmath12 equation is f(x , w(x ) ) x^2 w(x ) + x w(x ) + ^2 w(x ) = 0 .",
    "the associated autonomous equation is |f(z(t ) ) z(t ) + ^2 z(t ) = 0 .",
    "now there is a trivial fixed point at @xmath147 but the general solution to the autonomous equation is z(t ) = a(t ) + b(t ) . in terms of the equidimensional",
    "variables w(x ) = .",
    "finally , in terms of @xmath18 y(x ) = x^p .",
    "this now is an explicit example of a discrete power law .",
    "the solution is not scale invariant under arbitrary rescalings @xmath302 , but it is invariant under the specific rescaling @xmath303 .    note the implication : discrete self - similarity and discrete power laws are not as peculiar as one might at first imagine ; instead they are simply the next most complicated thing ( after simple power - law behaviour ) that can happen in scale invariant systems .",
    "( viewed in this light the occurrence of discrete self - similarity in choptuik s critical solution  @xcite should not at all be considered surprising . )",
    "the traditional [ isothermal ] lane  emden equation is ( z^2 ( z)z ) = ( -(z ) ) .",
    "( 0 ) = 0 ; .z|_0 = 0 .",
    "this second - oder de is completely equivalent to the first - order system we derived for a newtonian relativistic star . indeed",
    "( z ) = - , and the series we previously determined for @xmath175 in the newtonian case then carry over into series for the lane - emden function @xmath304 .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute ( z ) = 16z^2-z^4+z^6 -z^8+z^10 + o(z^12 ) .",
    "you can also derive this in a more direct way by putting a trial power series directly into the lane  emden de and equating coefficients .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the implication that at large @xmath25 the lane ",
    "emden function should have an expansion of the form ( z ) = + _ m=0^_n=0^q_mn z^(m_1+n_2 ) .",
    "[ recall @xmath305 . ] the coefficients @xmath306 are in turn determined by the recursion relations for @xmath177 and @xmath170 previously discussed .",
    "an alternative more direct route is to write @xmath307 + q(z),\\ ] ] and substitute into the lane ",
    "emden equation yielding \\ { z z zz + zz } q(z ) = 2 \\ { - 1 }",
    ". linearizing around the obvious solution @xmath308 recovers the critical indices @xmath305 , while inserting a trial series consisting of integer powers of these critical exponents will determine all the higher coefficients @xmath306 in terms of @xmath309 .",
