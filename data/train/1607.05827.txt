    "in this article we have systematically investigated the energy of mixing and entropy of mixing for cu@xmath0al@xmath1 liquid binary alloys at temperature @xmath3 k , from the first principles approach , specifically from the perturbation method , and the electronic theory of metals ( etm ) .",
    "recently , an increasing interest on the study of physical properties of cu@xmath0al@xmath1 binary alloys has been observed @xcite .",
    "study of mixing behavior of an alloy formed by two or more elemental metals is however important not only to understand the above thermodynamic behaviors alone but also to understand underlying mechanisms of other characterisric properties of matter such as segragation of alloys , phase transition , the glass transition temperature , and stability of liquid metals and their alloys at different thermodynamic states .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , the first application of the thermodynamic perturbation theory along with the gibbs - bogoliubov variational scheme for the liquid binary alloys was due umar @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "along the same line , thermodynamic properties are studied by some authors @xcite and , thus advanched our knowledge .",
    "but in the present investigation we have used the first principles perturbation approach without variational scheme @xcite .",
    "this approach uses the full potential profile in the theory and , allows us to understand different mechanisms involved in determining the mixing behavior of alloys .",
    "we further note that the present approach contains an important additional term in the theory than the approach of perturbation theory with variation@xcite provides .",
    "the energy of mixing , and entropy of mixing are not independent to each other in thermodynamics , these are rather related by the following thermodynamic relation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 denote the gibbs free energy of mixing and enthalpy of mixing .",
    "we note that at low pressure ( one or two atmospheric pressure ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are helmholtz free energy of mixing and internal energy of mixing , respectively .",
    "we further note that , at zero pressure the above relations between g and f , and h and e become exactly equal",
    ". henceforth by the term energy of mixing we shall mean @xmath11 if not otherwise stated .",
    "however , evaluation of energy of mixing directly involves the full profile of the interionic pair potentials wheares the entropy of mixing is related directly to the derivative of free energy with respect of temperature .",
    "so , it is always a challenging task to calculate entropy of mixing of liquid binary alloys theoretically . because , the success of the entropy calculation depends not on the free energy value but on the accuracy of the detailed shape of the free energy as a function of temperature .",
    "for example ,",
    "asta @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite shows that computer simulation along with different sophisticated eam potentials @xcite can predict the enthalpy of mixing well , but fails to describe entropy of mixing on the same footing .",
    "it is worth nothing that the energy of mixing predicts stability from the principle of minimization of free energy and , the entropy of mixing from the principle of maximum entropy . but",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath13 together can put the prediction on the firm basis . on the other hand ,",
    "the knowledge of entropy may be used to study the atomic transport properties through different scaling laws @xcite .",
    "cu@xmath0al@xmath1 binary alloy is formed by two different elements al and cu .",
    "al in the solid phase has @xmath14 crystalline structure .",
    "it is a relatively soft , durable , light weight , ductile and malleable metal .",
    "al is a good electrical and thermal conductor , and also a superconductor .",
    "it is a polyvalent system with chemical valence of @xmath15 .",
    "elemental cu has fcc structure in the solid phase and characterized by high ductility , electrical and thermal conductivity . although @xmath16-shell in this elements is filled by electrons , the @xmath16-band effect to the interionic interactions through @xmath17 hybridization is still there , which sometimes plays significant role in determining physical properties of cu .",
    "however , cu@xmath0al@xmath1 alloys display negative deviation from the rault s law . this alloy is characterized by a large amount of intermetallic phases in the solid state .    as discussed above",
    ", al is a simple polyvalent metal but cu exhibits @xmath16-band effects thorugh the @xmath18-@xmath16 hybridization .",
    "it is therefore urging a model for interionic interactions that can handle separately both simple metals with extended @xmath18-band and transition metals with narrow @xmath16-band adequately . in this regard the bretonnet - silbert ( bs ) pseudopotential model",
    "@xcite is a promosing candidate , because , it treats @xmath18 and @xmath16-band separately within the well established pseudopotential theory . here",
    ", the @xmath18-band is described via the empty core model and , the @xmath16-band effect is derived from the @xmath16-band scattering phase shift by using an inverse scattering approach .",
    "the resulting model reduces to a simple local form which appears similar to that of well known heine - aberenkov ( ha ) model @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two models is that the core term in the bs model is derived from the scattering phase shift and is a function of interionic distance and , in the ha model is a square well potential , which is derived by the quantum defect method .",
    "moreover , the bs model has already been proven to be successful in the study of static structure of liquid metals and their alloys @xcite , atomic transport properties @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , electronic transport properties @xcite and even a complicated phenomena of segregation @xcite .",
    "note that the norm - conserving non - local pseudopotentials @xcite are in principle , preferred for accurate predictions , but there are evidences that , the local potentials @xcite describe physical properties , in some cases , even better than the former ones .    in order to study the thermodynamics of mixing of liquid binary alloys several theories have been put forward ; of them the quasilattice theory @xcite , the electronic theory of metals ( etm ) @xcite , computer simulation method @xcite , empirical linear free energy @xcite and the free volume model @xcite are commonly used . in the semi - empirical quasi lattice theory the activity is expressed in terms of average interionic interaction energy and the formation of mixing via the gibbs free energy .",
    "the enrgy of mixing is then evaluated by fitting to the experimental data of the activity .",
    "the linear free energy theory and the free volume model are totally empirical ones .",
    "the electronic theory of models ( etm ) used in this work is based on the energy band structure of electons , a characristic feature of metals , and thus evolved as a microscopic theory of metal .",
    "the static structure factor is determined from the knowledge of interionic pair interions , obtained from the band structure energy , through the statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "most importantly , in the present approach , each term in the etm and the mechanism of its origin are clearly understandable from the physical point of view .",
    "it is well known that the first principles perturbation theory requires such a reference system which can closely resemble the concerned real system @xcite .",
    "there are many experimental as well as theoretical evidences that the hs theory of liquid can describe the structure of simple and transition metals and their binary alloys @xcite .",
    "being prompted by the above history of success we employ hs reference system within the percus - yevick approximation ( hspy ) @xcite in the present work .",
    "it is very much relevant to note here that , calculation of the static structure of hspy liquid system requires the knowledge of effective hard sphere diameter ( hsd ) .",
    "there are different methods to determine hsd for a liquid metal . of them",
    "we have chosen the linearized week - chandler - anderson ( lwca ) termodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "the base of the lwca theory is the wca theory , which was first applied in ref @xcite .",
    "this report is organized in the following way .",
    "theories relavant to the present calculations for thermodynamics of mixing are briefly described in section ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to the presentation of results of calculation , and for discussion .",
    "we , finally , conclude this article with some remarks in section iv .",
    "for calculating the energy of mixing and entropy of mixing for cu@xmath0al@xmath1 liquid binary alloy at @xmath3 k we have used different theories .",
    "some of the relevant theories namely the effective partial pair potentials , partial pair correlation functions for hs binary liquids , energy of mixing and entropy of mixing for liquid binary alloy are briefly described below .",
    "the local pseudopotential for one component metallic systems may be modeled by the superposition of the @xmath18-band and @xmath16-band contributions as @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the softness parameter , core radius and the effective s - electron occupancy , respectively . the term inside the core of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is deduced from the @xmath16-band scattering phase shift by using an inverse scattering approach .",
    "the term outside the core is just the coulomb interaction between a positive ion and a conduction electron .",
    "the coefficients of expansion in the core are related to the model parameters as @xmath23 @xmath24    the effective partial pair potentials may be written within the framework of the pseudopotential theory as @xcite @xmath25\\ ] ] where , the indices @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the ionic species @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in the above equaton , @xmath28 is the normalized energy wave number characteristics and can be expressed as @xmath29^{2}v_{i}(q)v_{j}(q)\\left[1-\\frac{1 } { \\varepsilon(q)}\\right]\\left[\\frac{1}{1-g(q)}\\right]\\ ] ] where , @xmath30 denotes the local pseudopotential for the @xmath26th component and @xmath31 the number density of ions , @xmath32 and @xmath33 the dielectric screening function and the local field factor , respectively . here , the dielectric function @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lindhard function ,    @xmath36\\ ] ]      the starting point of the lwca theory @xcite is the thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "@xmath40 is the inverse temperature divided by the boltzmann constant , and @xmath41 known as the cavity function .",
    "@xmath41 is associated with the hard sphere distribution function and is continuous at @xmath42 .",
    "if we plot @xmath43 , as a function of r , it will give two sharp teeth shaped feature .",
    "in the lwca theory this has been approximated by right angle triangles .",
    "the fourier transformation of b(r ) at @xmath44 is then expanded in terms of bessel s functions .",
    "thus the thermodynamic condition that for an effective hard sphere diameter @xmath45 vanishes , leads to the transcendental equation , @xmath46\\ ] ] for elemental system @xcite . in the case of alloys",
    "@xmath47 is replaced by @xmath48 and @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "equation ( 10 ) is solved graphically to obtain the effective hard sphere diameter .",
    "we note here that , @xmath51 determined from equation ( 10 ) is not strictly additive , but yields a value very close to ( @xmath52)/2 ( deviation is about 0.1% only ) .",
    "so , following ref .",
    "55 we use the average value ( @xmath52)/2 for @xmath51 in order for compliance with the additive hard sphere theory used in the present study .",
    "we calculate the ashcroft - langreth ( al ) partial structure factors , @xmath53 , in line with their original work @xcite . in order to evaluate partial structure factors ,",
    "the essential ingredients are the concentrations of two spheres in the mixture and the effective hsd .",
    "the values for the effective hsds for binary alloy are obtained from the lwca theory and are presented in table i. the partial pair correlation functions necessary for real space calculation are derived from the fourier transformation of s@xmath54 in the following way : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ionic number density of the alloy and c@xmath57 denotes the concentration of the @xmath26-th component .",

    "although the helmholtz free energy and entropy are closely related thermodynamically , the entropy of mixing is much more difficult to calculate as mentioned before .",

    "is completely free from any adjustable parameter . from this point of view result for the entropy of mixing is fairly good qualitatively .",
    "the main cause of discrepancy between theory and experiment in the cu - rich alloy is , in our view , due to the existance of the complicated @xmath16-band characteristics including @xmath17 hybridization effect in cu .",
    "in addition , the tendency to form a compound in the cu rich alloy might also be responsible to widen the discrepancy ; in order to establish it further research is required .",
    "so , apprantly , a quantitative description of thermodynamic properties of cu@xmath0al@xmath1 liquid binary alloys from the present approach requires a precise account for the @xmath16-band effects in the interionic interaction for cu .",
    "as our present approach provides total entropy of the elemental and alloy systems it may be extended to the study of atomic transport properties through the universal scaling laws@xcite .",
    "our present approach for free energy calculation may also be applied to the study of temperature dependent properties such as in theory of melting for metallic systems .",
