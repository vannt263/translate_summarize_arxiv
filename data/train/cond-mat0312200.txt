    "low atomic number elements have been intensively investigated in the attempt of finding electron phonon mediated superconductors with high critical temperatures ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "boron rich solids are eminent examples",
    ". the high energy phonon frequencies of metallic boron layers in the structure of magnesium diboride @xcite are mainly responsible for the 39 k @xmath5 .",
    "intercalation of these boron layers with lithium and boron substitution with carbon are currently under study @xcite in the quest of even higher @xmath5 .",
    "elemental boron becomes metallic ( in a non - icosahedral structure @xcite ) and superconducting at 160 gpa , with a @xmath5 which increases up to 11.2 k at 250 gpa @xcite .",
    "a 23 k @xmath5 has recently been discovered in intermetallic , yttrium palladium boron carbides@xcite .",
    "high temperature superconductivity has been found in alkali intercalated fullerene ( c@xmath7 ) and theoretically suggested in other intercalated carbon polyhedrons , c@xmath8@xcite , c@xmath9@xcite or c@xmath10@xcite .",
    "c@xmath7 is a band insulator under normal conditions but the intercalation with alkali atoms does generate a metallic state and a consequent superconducting state with @xmath5 up to @xmath11@xcite .",
    "superconductivity is mainly sustained by the high frequency intramolecular phonons so that most of the physical properties of alkali doped fullerenes can be understood from the solid c@xmath7 electronic and phonon structures .",
    "in particular it is seen that the small radius of the molecule substantially increases the electron - phonon coupling with respect to the case of the unrolled graphite layer @xcite .",
    "the study of solids made of light atoms is then interesting since they can satisfy the two important requirements of having large phonon frequencies and fairly high electron - phonon coupling .    in this work",
    "we propose a new route to achieve the superconducting state in boron - rich solids , the hole doping of b@xmath0 icosahedra .",
    "for this purpose we consider a prototype metallic phase of b@xmath1c@xmath2 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : crystal ] ) for which we predict a @xmath5 comparable to that of mgb@xmath2 .",
    "we show ( sec . [ sec : calcul ] ) that in this compound the boron icosahedral units are the main responsible for the predicted large @xmath5 .",
    "thus this high @xmath5 is a general feature of hole doped boron icosahedral solids .",
    "we consider the hole doping of boron carbide b@xmath0c@xmath12 ( or b@xmath13c ) , a wide gap band - insulator .",
    "its crystal structure consists of an arrangement of b@xmath14c distorted icosahedra on the site of a rhombohedral lattice and of a linear c - b - c atom chain @xcite .",
    "the periodic unit cell contains 15 atoms and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b4c ] .",
    "hole doped boron icosahedra can be naturally obtained replacing in b@xmath0c@xmath15 a carbon atom by a boron , giving b@xmath1c@xmath16 . due to the carbon substitution",
    "there is one hole per unit cell and , b@xmath1c@xmath16 being non magnetic , band theory predicts a metallic behaviour . at zero temperature and ambient pressure however , b@xmath1c@xmath16 is a semiconductor @xcite .",
    "the insulating character might be related to _",
    "( i ) _ the presence of structural defects @xcite _ ( ii ) _ mott polaronic features@xcite . in the first case a metallic state might be achieved simply by producing high quality samples . in the second case",
    "it might be generated by the application of hydrostatic pressure in order to increase the hopping between the icosahedral units .",
    "the pressure necessary to metallise b@xmath1c@xmath16 would be lower than that necessary to metallise b@xmath0c@xmath15 or @xmath17b .",
    "indeed , the mott - polaron gap in b@xmath1c@xmath16 is expected to be much smaller than the several ev gaps of the band insulators b@xmath0c@xmath15 and @xmath17b .",
    "the two most probable structures of b@xmath1c@xmath16 are b@xmath14c(bbc ) , _ i.e. _ b@xmath14c icosahedra linked by bbc chains , or b@xmath0(cbc ) , _ i.e. _ boron icosahedra linked by cbc chains . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite identified the b@xmath0(cbc ) structure as the most stable one with a 2.09 ev / cell larger binding energy with respect to b@xmath14c(bbc ) .",
    "experimentally @xcite the @xmath18c nmr spectrum of b@xmath1c@xmath2 confirms the dft calculations . indeed changing composition from b@xmath0c@xmath15 to b@xmath1c@xmath16 the nmr peak associated to the c atom in the icosahedron disappears .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we use the b@xmath0(cbc ) structure and we refer to it as the b@xmath1c@xmath16 crystal structure . in other works it has been suggested that the substituted boron is on the chain@xcite . we did not consider this proposed structure since we do not expect that the conclusions presented in this work are substantially affected by the location of the additional b atom .",
    "in b@xmath1c@xmath16 a metallic phase could be achieved either by obtaining clean samples or by applying a small pressure . in dft , already at room pressure , the ground state is metallic .",

    "in particular the boron atoms in the polar sites have the largest contribution to @xmath34 , namely @xmath35 and the contribution due to the equatorial sites is smaller , @xmath36 .",

    "in icosahedral boron compounds the bipolaron could be localized on two length scales : the icosahedron length scale or a smaller one , of the order of the bond length .",
    "if the bipolaron were localized on the icosahedron length scale ( as most of the bipolaronic literature seems to suggest @xcite ) the bipolaronic distortion could be seen as a small perturbation to the metallic state . in this case",
    "the bipolaron could be described within a model considering a linear electron - phonon coupling perturbation to the harmonic hamiltonian in the metallic phase .",
    "such a model is the one used in the present paper to study the superconducting properties .",
    "our calculated value of @xmath6 is too small@xcite to justify a bipolaronic insulating state for b@xmath1c@xmath16 . on the contrary",
    "our calculation can not exclude the occurrence of a bipolaron localized on the bond - length scale . in this scenario",
    "the bipolaron would involve a substantial deformation of our crystal structure ( e.g. the breaking or formation of chemical bonds ) .",
    "such a strong deformation could not be seen as a weak perturbation to the harmonic hamiltonian in the metallic state and could not be described by the approach used in the present paper .",
    "in this work we have studied the possible occurrence of superconductivity from hole doping boron icosahedra .",
    "we found the possibility of having high superconducting critical temperatures in these systems .",
    "as a possible physical realization of a metallic state we have considered b@xmath1c@xmath16 , which is formed from b@xmath0 icosahedral units with one hole per icosahedra . using _ ab - initio _ calculations we have determined its normal state properties , finding a moderate electron - phonon coupling and a large phonon logarithmic average to the phonon frequencies . we have demonstrated that both properties are connected to the b@xmath0 building blocks .",
    "indeed the local density of state at the fermi level and the phonon modes strongly coupled with electrons are localized on the icosahedra . as a consequence our findings",
    "are not restricted to b@xmath1c@xmath16 compounds but can be applied to other metallic compounds composed by b rich icosahedra .",
    "for example another possibility to achieve a metallic state is the substitution of p with si in b@xmath0p@xmath16 or of as with si in b@xmath0as@xmath16 . b@xmath0p@xmath16 and b@xmath0as@xmath16 are band insulators composed by b@xmath0 icosahedra and 2-atom p@xmath16 or as@xmath2 chains@xcite .",
    "the substitution of pentavalent atoms like as and p with a tetravalent si introduces a hole in the system .",
    "b@xmath0p@xmath58si@xmath59 wafer resistivity measurements show a low electrical conductivity @xcite .",
    "if such conduction were related to bipolaron formation then a metallic state could be achieved applying pressure .",
    "an advantage of the 2-atom chain systems ( b@xmath0p@xmath58si@xmath59 or b@xmath0as@xmath58si@xmath59 ) respect to the 3-atom chain systems ( b@xmath1c@xmath16 ) is the lack in the formers of an internal soft degree of freedom , the chain bending .",
    "probably this feature makes the 2-atom chain structures more stable under pressure .",
