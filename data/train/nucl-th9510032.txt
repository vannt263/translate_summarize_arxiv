    "there are many instances in relativistic quantum field theory where perturbation theory is inadequate , in particular when the coupling constant characterizing the interaction becomes too large .",
    "an alternative approach , which remains valid in the strong coupling regime , is the use of a variational principle . although there exists a sizable body of literature on the use of variational methods in relativistic quantum field theories   @xcite it is fair to say that these methods are less widely used in this area of physics than the standard rayleigh - ritz variational method in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "this is largely due to the fact that one has to deal with a system with infinitely many degrees of freedom , the requirements of relativistic invariance and renormalizability of the theory .",
    "the problem of the infinitely many degrees of freedom , however , is also present in non - relativistic field theories and here there exists a variational method which deals with this problem very successfully ",
    "feynman s variational treatment of the polaron  @xcite .",
    "a very early attempt to use this method in a relativistic setting was made in ref .",
    "@xcite and was recently reinvented and extended by us  @xcite . (",
    "the method has also previously been adapted for use in non - relativistic nuclear physics  @xcite ) .",
    "the particular lagrangian which was considered in these papers was that of two scalar particles , one heavy ( henceforth referred to as the ` nucleon ' ) and one light ( the ` meson ' ) , interacting via a yukawa coupling .",
    "this variant of the wick - cutkosky model  @xcite was chosen because of its simplicity , its similarity to several realistic lagrangians ( such as those of qed and nucleon - meson theories ) and because it has traditionally been used for the study of non - perturbative techniques  @xcite .",
    "the quantities of interest in a relativistic field theory are the green functions of the theory .",
    "the work in refs .",
    "@xcite concerned itself with the calculation of a subset of these green functions in the quenched approximation for the nucleon .",
    "in particular , green functions with 2 external ( on - shell ) nucleon legs and any number of external meson legs were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "feynman s variational method involves the use of the path integral formalism . as is well known , in general it is only possible to do gaussian path integrals analytically . because of this he made use of a particular approximation ",
    "jensen s inequality which can be exploited for variational purposes .",
    "equivalently , this corresponds to the first order term in a cumulant expansion ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the variational calculation of the nucleon propagator was performed using the same approximation .",
    "the only quantity of interest there was the residue of this propagator , the position of the pole being defined as the ( non - perturbatively ) renormalized mass of the nucleon .",
    "( in addition , the ` width ' of the nucleon was calculated ",
    "this quantity is not zero as the wick - cutkosky model is inherently unstable . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite the general @xmath0-point function was then written down to zeroth order in the cumulant expansion .",
    "although already _ qualitatively _ interesting at this order ( for example , even at zeroth order these green functions contain parts of all feynman diagrams to all orders in the coupling ) , these green functions clearly had some unwanted _ numerical _ features .",
    "in particular , at this order all dependence on the external momenta is gaussian , resulting in , for example , a gaussian form factor .",
    "furthermore , one of the strong points of feynman s treatment of the polaron was that agreement with perturbation theory was assured to the order in the cumulant expansion in which one calculates .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-point functions calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite only agree with perturbation theory at tree level .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-point function to first order in the cumulant expansion , therefore greatly improving the numerical results .",
    "more importantly , it will be shown that the variational equations for any of these green functions are in fact the same , i.e. once one has determined the numerical value of the variational parameters from one of these functions , say the propagator of the nucleon ( @xmath1 = 0 ) , the other ones may be calculated with the use of the same parameters .",
    "it will also be shown that it is possible to truncate the @xmath0-point function consistently ; that is , the propagators on the external nucleon legs have poles at the physical nucleon mass , as they should .",
    "an important ingredient of the method has been the use of the particle representation of a field theory @xcite , which has undergone something of a revival in recent years @xcite .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : particle representation ] by briefly outlining how one derives the expression for the quenched @xmath0-point function in the particle representation . having done this",
    ", we perform the actual variational calculation in section  [ sec : formalism ] , resulting in the ` master formula ' for the @xmath0-point function at first order in the cumulant expansion . an important check , that this formula agrees with perturbation theory to one - loop order , is relegated to the appendix .",
    "it should be noted that throughout this derivation we work in euclidean space - time .",
    "the green functions can however be continued to minkowski space .",
    "this is done , for the @xmath2-point function , in section  [ sec : vertex ] and numerical results are derived and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] . we conclude with some general observations in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "before we turn to the calculation of the general quenched green function with two external nucleon and @xmath1 external meson legs in first order in the cumulant expansion , we need to derive the particle representation of this function . for the propagator",
    "this was already done in ref .",
