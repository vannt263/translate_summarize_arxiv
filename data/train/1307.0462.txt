    "collision velocities of particles in randomly mixing or turbulent flows ( turbulent aerosols ) have been studied intensively for several decades .",
    "this is an important topic because the stability of turbulent aerosols is determined by collisions between the suspended particles .",
    "one example is the problem of rain initiation in turbulent cumulus clouds .",
    "it is argued @xcite that small - scale turbulent stirring increases the collision rate of microscopic water droplets causing them to coalesce more often and thus accelerating the growth of rain droplets .",
    "this idea goes back to smoluchowski @xcite .",
    "saffman and turner @xcite invoked this principle to estimate the geometrical collision rate of small water droplets advected in the air flow of turbulent cumulus clouds , assuming that the droplets are swept towards each other by essentially time - independent turbulent shears ( effects due to the unsteadiness of turbulent flows are discussed by andersson _",
    "_ @xcite and gustavsson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is now well known that particle inertia may have a substantial effect on the collision rate . unlike advected particles , inertial particles are not constrained to follow the flow .",
    "direct numerical simulations of particles in turbulent flows @xcite show that the average collision speed ( and thus the collision rate ) increases rapidly as the stokes number @xmath5 is varied beyond a threshold .",
    "the stokes number is a dimensionless measure of the particle inertia .",
    "this sensitive dependence of the collision speed ( and collision rate ) upon @xmath5 was explained in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) by the occurrence of so - called caustics , singularities in the particle dynamics at non - zero values of @xmath5 .",
    "caustics appear when phase - space manifolds describing the dependence of particle velocity upon particle position fold over @xcite . in the fold region , the velocity field at a given point in space becomes multi - valued , allowing for large velocity differences between nearby particles . in the absence of such singularities , in single - valued smooth particle - velocity fields ,",
    "the relative velocity of two particles tends to zero as they approach each other . in the presence of caustics , by contrast",
    ", the relative velocity of two colliding particles may be large .",
    "there are now a number of different parameterisations of the average geometrical collision rate between inertial particles @xcite , and for average relative velocities @xcite conditional on a small separation @xmath7 .",
    "the geometrical collision rate neglects the fact that particles approaching each other may not collide : viscous effects can cause the particles to avoid each other @xcite .",
    "this effect is commonly parameterised in terms of a collision efficiency .",
    "relatively little is known about the collision efficiency in turbulent flows .",
    "it must sensitively depend on the relative speed of the particles .",
    "when the relative speed is small the particles may spend a substantial amount of time close together .",
    "this gives viscous forces time to affect the collision dynamics .",
    "the collision efficiency depends strongly on the stokes number and the turbulence intensity , its mean value may range over several orders of magnitude @xcite , and its instantaneous values fluctuate substantially @xcite . in order to understand these properties of the collision efficiency",
    "it is necessary to study the distribution of relative velocities in turbulent flows .",
    "a theory of the average relative velocity is not sufficient .",
    "the distribution of collision velocities is important also for another aspect of the problem , namely the question under which circumstances colliding droplets coalesce .",
    "the coalescence efficiency @xcite may depend sensitively on the actual collision velocity .",
    "a second example where the distribution of relative velocities of inertial particles is of great significance is the problem of planet formation .",
    "it is thought that the planets in our solar system have formed out of microscopic dust grains suspended in the turbulent gas flow surrounding the sun .",
    "it is assumed that micron - sized grains grow by collisional aggregation in the first stage of this process .",
    "the standard model is reviewed by youdin @xcite and armitage @xcite ( an alternative model for planet formation was proposed by wilkinson _",
    "a problem in the standard model is that as the aggregates grow their stokes number increases .",
    "this in turn implies that the aggregates collide at larger impact velocities which may cause the aggregates to fragment upon impact , hindering further growth .",
    "@xcite discuss this problem in detail , see also @xcite . how severe this barrier to further growth is depends on how easily the aggregates fragment .",
    "several different models for the fragmentation process have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the models have in common that the time the aggregates spend close to each other is an important ( and unknown ) factor",
    ". even when colliding grains do not shatter , they may erode , or bounce off each other @xcite .",
    "the process is further complicated by the fact that the aggregates are not compact @xcite . in order to describe the kinetics of the aggregation ( and fragmentation ) process",
    "it is necessary to know the distribution of relative velocities @xcite .",
    "it is not sufficient to estimate the average relative speed of nearby particles @xcite .",
    "the joint distribution of relative velocities and spatial separations is determined by the dynamics of the suspended particles in phase space . to compute this dynamics is a very complicated problem .",
    "it is commonly simplified by assuming that the particles are identical , spherical and very small , and that they do not directly interact with each other . in this case , provided that the particles are larger than the mean free path of the fluid , the equation of motion was derived by maxey and riley @xcite .",
    "the problem is often further simplified by keeping only stokes force in the maxey - riley equation : @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are particle position and velocity , dots denote time derivatives , @xmath11 is the rate at which the inertial motion is damped relative to the fluid , and @xmath12 is the velocity field of the flow .",
    "for particles suspended in a dilute gas ( when the particles are smaller than the mean free path of the gas , the epstein limit ) a law of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) holds .    even for eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) the distribution of relative velocities of inertial particles was not known until recently .",
    "we computed the joint distribution of relative velocities and spatial separations in random velocity fields in the white - noise limit by means of diffusion approximations @xcite .",
    "we found that the relative - velocity distribution at small spatial separations could be very broad ( of power - law form ) and showed that this is a consequence of the existence of caustics and fractal clustering in phase space at finite stokes number @xmath13 ( here @xmath14 is the correlation time of the flow , the kolmogorov time in turbulent flows ) .",
    "a second dimensionless parameter , the kubo number @xmath15 @xcite , is formed out of the typical flow speed @xmath16 and the correlation length @xmath17 ( the kolmogorov length ) .",
    "the white - noise limit corresponds to the limit @xmath18 and @xmath19 so that @xmath20 remains constant .",
    "but the turbulent flow seen by a moving particle is not a white - noise signal , turbulent flows have kubo numbers of order unity .",
    "@xcite described numerical results for the moments of relative velocities at small separations in a kinematic model of turbulence with @xmath21 . at very small separations , where caustics make a substantial contribution ,",
    "these numerical results are well described by the white - noise results of ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it thus seems that the white - noise approximation , based on a perturbative solution of a fokker - planck equation , describes important properties of relative velocities in turbulent aerosols .",
    "but there is to date no theory for the distribution of relative velocities for the physically most relevant case of @xmath21 .     snapshot of particle positions and velocities in one spatial dimension according to the model described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( that is @xmath24 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon_def ] ) ) , and the system size is @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding fractal dimensions are : kaplan - yorke dimension @xmath26 , phase - space correlation dimension @xmath27 .",
    "the particle number density is colour coded.,width=453 ]    in this paper we describe a general principle determining the joint distribution of relative velocities and spatial separations in turbulent aerosols . in its most general form",
    "it does not rely upon the white - noise approximation .",
    "the method is based on matching asymptotic forms of the distribution function in phase space .    as mentioned above",
    "there are two distinct ways in which particles move relative to each other .",
    "this gives rise to two contributions to the distribution .",
    "first , the formation of caustics allows particles to rapidly approach each other on different branches of the phase - space attractor ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : attractor ] in one spatial dimension ) .",
    "the corresponding phase - space distribution is of power - law form ( reflecting fractal clustering in phase space ) .",
    "second , if two particles approach on the same branch , then the pair diffuses in a correlated manner and the particles stay close to each other for a long time ( determined by the inverse maximal lyapunov exponent ) , at small relative velocities .",
    "it turns out that the corresponding relative velocity distribution is approximately constant , that is independent of the relative velocity at small separations .",
    "our result for the distribution of relative velocities ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_asym_generaldim ] ) in section  [ sec:3 ] ) is obtained by glueing theses two pieces together .",
    "this method takes into account fractal clustering in phase space and caustic formation .",
    "our method makes it possible to identify which properties of the distribution function are universal , and which properties are system specific ( depend on the details of the flow statistics ) .",
    "the power - law form of the distribution of relative velocities at small separations is a universal feature .",
    "it pertains to systems that exhibit fractal clustering , at sufficiently high stokes numbers so that caustics are abundant .",
    "our result for the distribution of relative velocities , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_asym_generaldim ] ) , contains two system - specific parameters : the phase - space correlation dimension @xmath0 and a matching parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the matching scale @xmath28 distinguishes the two types of relative motion ( due to pair diffusion and caustics ) discussed above . for small stokes numbers caustics are rare and the dynamics",
    "is dominated by system - specific pair diffusion . in this limit",
    "the distribution is not universal . at larger stokes numbers where caustics are abundant ( the formation of caustics is an activated process ) , caustics and pair diffusion compete , and the distribution assumes the universal shape summarised in eq .",
