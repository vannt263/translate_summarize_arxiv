    "magnetic fields play a crucial role in many astrophysical processes ( e.g. , star formation , accretion disks , cosmic ray transport ) . an important and easily available way to map magnetic fields",
    "is to observe the polarization of emission or absorption by aligned grains ( goodman et al . 1995 ; hildebrand et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; crutcher et al .",
    "the reliable interpretation of polarimetry in terms of magnetic fields requires , however , a solid understanding of the alignment of grains .",
    "this is the major motivation of work in the field of grain alignment .",
    "an additional motivation to understand when grains get aligned comes from the necessity of separating the polarization by dust grains from the polarized cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) signal ( see lazarian 2008 ) .",
    "grain alignment is a complex area of studies related to many physical effects of different time scales ( see review by lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "it is also the research area associated with the names of lyman spitzer and ed purcell , who decisively contributed to understanding of a number of fundamental physical processes of grain alignment .",
    "a number of mechanism has been known to induce grain alignment ( see lazarian 2007 ) . however , recently grain helicity has been discussed as the necessary element of successful alignment .",
    "note that the idea of grains having twist and therefore interacting differently with left and right polarized photons can be traced back to the pioneering work by dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) .",
    "a more recent work in the area showed that a similar effect is present when irregular grains interact with a gaseous flow ( lazarian & hoang 2007b ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on studying grain alignment by radiative torques ( hereafter rats ) .",
    "however , the intrinsic similarity of the radiative and mechanical torques acting on helical grains ( see discussion in lazarian & hoang 2007b ) makes our present results applicable to the alignment by mechanical torques .",
    "note that for the alignment of helical grains , the magnetic field acts only through inducing the larmor precession .",
    "therefore the alignment may potentially occur with both longer and shorter grain axes perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "observations of interstellar dust indicate that the alignment with the long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field is dominant in the diffuse gas . therefore we shall call this alignment _ right alignment _ , and the opposite type of alignment we shall call _ wrong alignment_. different alignment processes produce either right or wrong alignment and the goal of the grain alignment theory is to predict correctly both the direction and the degree of the expected alignment .    as dust grain scatters or absorbs photons it experiences radiative torques .",
    "these torques can be stochastic or regular .",
    "stochastic rats arise from , for instance , a spheroidal grain randomly emitting or absorbing photons . the latter process , for instance",
    ", was invoked by harwit ( 1970 ) in his model of grain alignment based on grains being preferentially spun up in the direction perpendicular to the photon beam .",
    "however , purcell & spitzer ( 1971 ) showed that the randomization arising from the same grain emitting thermal photons makes the achievable degree of grain alignment negligible .",
    "in fact , they showed that stochastic rats arising from grain thermal emission is an important process of grain randomization .",
    "more recently , grain thermal emission was analyzed as a source of the excitation of grain rotation as well as its damping in relation to the rotation of tiny spinning grains that are likely to be responsible for the so - called anomalous foreground emission ( draine & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "rats were first discussed by dolginov ( 1972 ) in terms of chiral , e.g. hypothetical quartz grains .",
    "the idea is that starlight passing through such grains would spin them up .",
    "later , dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) considered an irregular grain model of two spheroids twisted to each other , made of more accepted materials , e.g. silicate grains , and claimed that these grains will be both spun up and aligned by _ regular rats_. this work was , unfortunately , mostly ignored for 20 years .",
    "grain alignment by rats drew much attention when bruce draine modified the discrete dipole approximation code(draine & flatau 2004 , hereafter ddscat ) and enabled later researchers to calculate rats for irregular grains .",
    "draine & weingartner ( 1996 , hereafter dw96 ) treated rats as a kind of pinwheel torque , and they found that rats can accelerate grains to suprathermal rotations .",
    "later , draine & weingartner ( 1997 , hereafter dw97 ) introduced many essential elements of the modern treatment of rats , for instance , phase trajectory maps .",
    "they confirmed dolginov & mytraphanov ( 1976 ) hypothesis that rats can produce the alignment by their own .",
    "however , the important moments of grain dynamics , so - called crossovers , were not treated correctly in the paper .",
    "crossovers , are special events in the dynamics of grains rotating subject to regular torques . during crossovers",
    "grain angular velocity approaches its minimal value and models of crossovers caused by pinwheel torques in spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ) and in lazarian & draine ( 1997 ) envisaged grain flipping with the direction of the angular momentum staying the same .",
    "dw97 , however , assumed that the rat crossovers are different and during the rat - induced crossovers angular momentum changes its direction to the opposite .",
    "this treatment of crossovers resulted in grains having cyclic trajectories , which were , in fact , an artifact of the adopted treatment , as was shown later ( lazarian & hoang 2007a , henceforth lh07a ) .",
    "in fact , lh07a showed that instead of cyclic trajectories , one gets situations when rats tend to _ slow _ grains down .",
    "a more general analysis for dynamics of rat alignment was done in weingartner & draine ( 2003 , henceforth wd03 ) , where thermal fluctuations within grain were accounted for .",
    "these fluctuations were shown by lazarian ( 1994 , see also lazarian & roberge 1997 ) to induce grain thermal wobbling , which amplitude gets larger as the grain angular momentum approaches its thermal values . for their choice of parameters ,",
    "wd03 found that an attractor with low angular momentum , so - called , low - j attractor , appears on the trajectory phase maps .",
    "larger than the thermal value is called a high - j attractor , and the attractor with @xmath1 of the order of thermal value is called low - j attractor . ]",
    "the study , however , was limited in terms of parameter space explored .",
    "in fact , it was a numerical study of alignment of a single grain subjected to the electromagnetic wave of a single frequency at a single incident direction",
    ". therefore implications of the study for the problem of the rat alignment were difficult to evaluate .",
    "we feel that the numerical work above done with ddscat should be treated as an experimental attack on the problem of the rat alignment .",
    "the limitations of such an approach are self - evident .",
    "for instance , to obtain predictions one should analyze many hundreds of different grain shapes and many wavelengths and many incident directions .",
    "the study in dw97 included 3 shapes and resulting torques looked very different , which made one wonder what causes the alignment .",
    "at the same time , unfortunately , the analytical study in dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) was in error .",
    "the first analytical model ( henceforth amo ) of rats consistent with the numerical calculations was proposed in lh07a .",
    "this study provided simple analytical expressions for the rats ( see also  2 ) .",
    "in particular , the functional forms of the torques acting on grains of different shapes are similar , with the difference between the grains of different shapes amounting to a single parameter , termed @xmath0-ratio , which is the ratio of the magnitudes of two first components of torques in the grain symmetry system of reference where the radiation direction is the symmetry axis .",
    "amo allowed theoretical predictions and the analytical treatment of the rat alignment . as a result ,",
    "studies of a parameter space seized to be an insurmountable problem . in lh07a ,",
    "similar to dw97 , the thermal fluctuations were intentionally disregarded and in such a setup the low-@xmath1 attractors , rather than cyclic trajectories , were reported .",
    "in fact , it became clear that rats , over a large part of the parameter space , _ spin down _ rather than _",
    "spin up _ grains . using amo , lh07a obtained the values @xmath0 for which grains have only low-@xmath1 attractors and when they have both low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 attractors simultaneously .",
    "amo was extensively used in all our papers that followed .",
    "for instance , in hoang & lazarian ( 2008a , henceforth hl08a ) , we studied the rat alignment in the presence of thermal fluctuations using both amo and ddscat for an extended sample of grain shapes , radiation direction and wavelength .",
    "we found that _",
    "grains do not stop completely , but rotate at a rate , which is comparable with the rate of thermal rotation at the dust temperature , which agrees with an earlier example in wd03 .",
    "importantly , hl08a considered the rat alignment in the presence of gaseous bombardment and reported a new effect , namely , the transfer between the low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 attractors , in situations when the both low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 attractors were present simultaneously and high-@xmath1 attractors are similar and known through the lh07a study . ] .",
    "thus , counterintuitively , the collisions were found to _ increase _ the alignment .",
    "the most important practical implication of the lh07a and hl08a studies was that , over a large range of the parameter space of @xmath0-ratio and angles between the magnetic field and radiation direction , the grains rotate thermally and therefore , as a result the aforementioned thermal fluctuations of grains , and exhibit the reduced alignment of grain axes with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this opened possibilities of estimating the expected alignment and comparing it to the alignment inferred from observations .",
    "importantly enough , lazarian & hoang ( 2008 , henceforth lh08 ) reported , that in the presence of superparamagnetic inclusions ( jones & spitzer 1967 , mathis 1986 , bradley 1994 , martin 1994 , goodman & whittet 1994 ) , the high-@xmath1 attractors _ always _ exist .",
    "this finding entails a very non - trivial effect , namely , that , in the presence of both superparamagnetic inclusions , grains , that otherwise would rotate subthermally , get into the state of fast suprathermal rotation . according to hl08a , this also means that _ all _ grains eventually get into the state of fast rotation and _ perfect _ alignment . from the point of view of observations , this opens prospects of testing the existence of superparamagnetic inclusions by measuring the degree of polarization .",
    "this paper continues our studies in lh07a and hl08a .",
    "the major issues we address below are ( 1 ) the effect of internal relaxation , and ( 2 ) the effect of complex radiation field on the grain alignment .",
    "the first issue is important in terms of the alignment of large grains , e.g. grains within proto - planetary accretion disks .",
    "the alignment of such grains was assumed in a recent modeling of polarization from t - tauri accretion disks in cho & lazarian ( 2007 ) .",
    "grains which are important for such a modeling may , however , should be sufficiently large that the internal relaxation time for them is longer than the alignment time",
    ". therefore , how grains get aligned in the absence of efficient internal relaxation is an important question .",
    "the second issue is vital for modeling the polarization from both disks and dark clouds .",
    "the latter modeling which used the rat alignment was undertaken in cho & lazarian ( 2005 ) , pelkonen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and bethell et al .",
    "all these studies assumed rather naive models of alignment .",
    "in particular , the actual modeling would require taking into account the actual complex radiation field that is being experienced by the grain , rather than to assume that the radiation is coming from a point source .    in what follows , in  2",
    "we briefly describe the amo , grain torque - free motion , and calculations of rats . in ",
    "3 we compare the barnett and nuclear relaxation times with the radiative alignment time and identify grain size when the internal relaxation can be disregarded . in ",
    "4 we study the properties of rats and the resulting rat alignment for large grains in the absence of the internal relaxation . grain alignment by rats arising from dipole and quadrupole components of radiation fields is studied in  5 .",
    "we discuss our findings in  6 , and our summary is presented in  7 .",

    "it is easy to see that the angular momentum achievable ( i.e. , maximal value ) depends on the angle @xmath277 .",
    "now , let us adopt the irregular grain ( shape 1 ) with rats obtained using ddscat , and calculate the value of the maximal angular momentum @xmath315 produced by dipole and quadrupole components of the isrf as a function of the angle @xmath277 .",
    "the anisotropy degree of radiation @xmath155 is assumed for all components .",
    "we comapre the results with that induced by a beam of radiation .    in the lower panel of figure [ f14 ]",
    "we present the resulting value of @xmath316 . there",

    "the dipole component results in lower values of @xmath317 compared to that produced by the radiation beam ( see fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , lower ) , as a result of the average over the entire space for the dipole field .",
    "the degree of rat alignment depends strongly on the possibility of existence of high-@xmath1 attractors ( see hl08a ) .",
    "in lh07a , we identified the criteria for the existence of high-@xmath1 as a function of the angle between the beam direction and the magnetic field .",
    "there it is shown that the high-@xmath1 attractor occurs when @xmath258 for @xmath319 , and @xmath320 for @xmath321 .",
    "in other words , there is a gap of @xmath0 from @xmath49 to @xmath322 , in which there is no high-@xmath1 attractors , irrespective of grain shape and size .",
    "fortunately , the dipole and quadrupole radiation can produce the high-@xmath1 attractors for @xmath323 ( see fig .",
    "[ f14 ] ) for @xmath307 .",
    "it indicates that the dipole and quadrupole extends the range of high-@xmath1 attractor and enable us to have high-@xmath1 attractors for @xmath324 to @xmath322 .",
    "this range is easily satisfied for irregular grains ( see lh07a ) in a wide range of @xmath325 .",
    "therfore , an enhancement of the degree of the rat alignment is expected for the dipole and quadrupole field compared to the case of a radiation beam .",
    "in the rest of this section we provide a brief account of our accomplishments in the paper and present our outlook on the further work in the field of grain alignment .      traditionally , grain alignment was the topic of interstellar medium ( ism ) research .",
    "the gap between the studies of polarized radiation from aligned dust in environments other then the ism and the theory of grain alignment got so wide that the researchers outside the ism domain sometimes write papers about aligned dust and do not refer to _ any _ theoretical work on grain alignment .",
    "however , there is ample evidence of grain alignment in non - ism environments ( see tamura et al .",
    "1999 ; rosenbush et al . 2007 ;",
    "hough et al . 2007 ) .    in many of these environments ,",
    "e.g. , for dust in comets and circumstellar dust , the radiation field is stronger than in the ism , thus rats are stronger .",
    "one difference that one faces there is that grains may be substantially larger . as we demonstrated in the paper , for larger grains",
    "the internal relaxation gets slower , which makes one wonder whether the rat alignment happens very differently from the ism case .",
    "our study shows that the direction of alignment of the angular momentum @xmath20 with respect to the magnetic field @xmath236 is similar to that in the presence of strong internal relaxation .",
    "this alignment can be perfect with high - j and/or low - j attractors , depending on the factor @xmath0 . however , the alignment of grain axes with respect to @xmath20 depends on the initial angle between them , more precisely , on the initial value of dimensionless parameter @xmath48 .",
    "if this angle is smaller than a particular value , @xmath224 , defined in the main text , which is a function of @xmath0 , the grain axis of maximum moment of inertia @xmath14 gets aligned along @xmath20 , and both @xmath14 and @xmath20 become aligned with @xmath236 .",
    "hl08b showed that pinwheel torques ( e.g. , h@xmath326 formation , isotropic radiative torque , etc . ) increase fast with the grain size . as a result",
    ", large grains can be spun up to suprathermal rotation with @xmath327 .",
    "the direct effect of suprathermal rotation is the alignment of @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "table 1 compares our results for grains without and with internal relaxation using the amo .",
    "we can see that for high - j attractors , the alignment is the same in both cases .",
    "we note that the results in the later case were shown to be consistent with the alignment of irregular grains obtained by ddscat .",
    "however the general case of alignment of large irregular grains in the absence of internal relaxation requires further studies to confirm the predictions obtained with the amo .",
    "further studies should consider also the effect of pinwheel torques on the alignment in the absence of internal relaxation .",
    "the analytical model ( amo ) was introduced in lh07a to describe the case of alignment in the presence of _ perfect _ alignment of @xmath2 with the axis of maximal moment of grain inertia .",
    "it provided excellent representation of the alignment of irregular grains within this approximation .",
    "later in hl08a and hl08b we applied amo to grains in the presence of thermal fluctuations , which at small values of @xmath1 partially randomize the alignment of @xmath2 with the aforementioned axis . nevertheless , amo happened to do a nice job in these cases , adequately describing the behavior of irregular grains .",
    "the case of no internal alignment is the extreme case of testing amo .",
    "for instance , amo has only one helicity axis , while multiple helicity axes are possible for an irregular grain .",
    "it is interesting , that even for this case , our limited testing is indicative of the amo s utility .      similar to the polarimetric work of non - ism observers , the modeling of polarization arising from aligned grains has been mostly developing without much connection to the theory of grain alignment .",
    "exceptions from this rule include cho & lazarian ( 2005 , 2007 ) , pelkonen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , bethell et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and falceta - golcaves et al .",
    "however , this modeling was done on the basis of somewhat ad hoc alignment prescriptions , which should be improved as the theory gets predictive .",
    "a step towards a more reliable polarization modeling is done in this paper where we considered grain alignment induced by the dipole and quadroupole components of the radiation field .",
    "the earlier studies assumed that the radiation was coming from a particular direction , which is , for instance , not the case for most of the grains in starless cores or accretion disks . in the latter cases it is proper to decompose the radiation field in multipoles and consider the effects of the individual components .",
    "our study shows that the parameter space for having high-@xmath1 attractors differs for the alignment by the different multipole components .",
    "moreover we identified the range of torque ratio , @xmath0 , for which the presence of dipole and quadroupole components of radiation field results in the alignment with high-@xmath1 attractors .",
    "the required range @xmath0 is fulfilled for irregular grains studied in hl08a .",
    "in our paper we showed that the analytical results on rats in dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) were incorrect ( see fig .",
    "[ f15 ] ) .",
    "therefore , naturally , our present results on the rat alignment obtained for grains in the absence of internal relaxation , which was also the assumption in dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) study , differ from those in the study .",
    "this should not , however , undermine the pivotal significance of the the dolginov & mytrophanov paper .",
    "this paper is important as it _ discovered _ rats and discussed the possibility of irregular grains being aligned by rats , even if it failed to describe it quantitatively .",
    "in addition , the notion of grain helicity , which is the central concept of amo , can be traced back to dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) work . moreover , as we mentioned in the introduction , the problem was so hard that the papers that followed dolginov & mytraphanov ( 1976 ) , in all its complexity , were not able to capture correctly the physics of the rat alignment either .      our paper , for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "does not consider the effect of the pinwheel torques .",
    "such torques , e.g. torques arising due to h@xmath328 formation over catalytic sites over grain surface ( purcell 1979 ) , were discussed in the framework of the rat alignment in hoang & lazarian ( 2008b ) for grains with strong internal relaxation . a study of effect of these torques on large grains , for which the effects of internal relaxation are reduced , will be done elsewhere .",
    "in addition , in our paper we considered the rat alignment in respect to magnetic field . as we discussed in lh07a , for a sufficiently slow rate of larmor rotation , the alignment can happen also in respect to the radiation field .",
    "if , however , grains have superparamagnetic inclusions the rate of rotation increases substantially .",
    "this , potentially , provides another way of testing whether grains have or do not have superparamagnetic inclusions .",
    "in this paper we continued our work on the rat alignment using both amo and ddscat calculations of torques .",
    "our principal results in the paper above can be summarized as follows :    @xmath329 we identified the range of grain size for which the internal relaxation within a normal paramagnetic grain is not important .",
    "@xmath329 we demonstrated that , in the absence of internal relaxation , rats can align the grain s angular momentum with respect to the magnetic field , which is similar to the alignment in the presence of strong internal relaxation . for the internal alignment of grain axes with the angular momentum , it can be perfect , i.e. @xmath263 when the initial angle between them is small .",
    "@xmath330 we studied the rat alignment induced by dipole and quadrupole components of the radiation field assuming perfect internal alignment of grain axis of maximum moment of inertia with the angular momentum due to _",
    "strong internal relaxation_. using the amo , we found that the parameter space for the existence of high - j attractors is extended compared to the earlier studied case of a single direction radiation .",
    "this parameter space is given by the range of @xmath0 and the angle @xmath277 between the symmetric axis of dipole and quadrupole radiation fields and the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , higher degrees of radiative alignment are expected .",
    "@xmath329 our study for the joint action of dipole and quadrupole components showed that for the angle @xmath277 between the dipole and quadrupole axis and the radiation direction smaller than @xmath331 degree , the dipole component has to be dominant over quadrupole one in order to align grains with high - j attractors .",
