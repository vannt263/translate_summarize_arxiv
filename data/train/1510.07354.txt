    "diquarks were introduced long time ago and are used in many phenomenology studies of strong interactions . for example , diquarks are used to describe baryons with a quark - diquark picture for explaining the missing states  @xcite .",
    "also they are used to explain the @xmath7 rule in weak nonleptonic decays  @xcite .",
    "a review on diquarks are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . since the discovery of @xmath8 by the belle collaboration  @xcite ,",
    "experiments have observed many so called xyz states  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to interpret these states as conventional heavy quarkonia .",
    "molecules and tetraquarks are proposed to explain some of these quarkoniumlike states . in the tetraquark scenario , a diquark and an antidiquark form a four quark state .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory describing the strong interaction among quarks and gluons , from which the properties of diquark correlations ( if any ) should be understood . at low energies , qcd has to be solved by nonperturbative methods since the strong coupling constant becomes so strong that perturbative calculations break down . in this work",
    "we study diquarks starting from the qcd action by using lattice qcd simulations .",
    "diquarks have been studied on the lattice from various approaches  @xcite to deal with the fact that they are not color singlets .",
    "diquark masses were also calculated in qcd sum rules , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . and",
    "the stability of diquarks were discussed as well  @xcite .",
    "the scalar diquark is supposed to be the state with the strongest correlation .",
    "the mass difference between diquarks with various quantum numbers can reflect the relative size of the correlation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , scalar diquark and quark mass difference as well as the axial vector and scalar diquark mass difference are estimated from baryon spectroscopy . on the lattice ,",
    "diquark mass and mass differences can be studied in a fixed gauge .",
    "so far , the masses and mass differences are calculated mostly in the quenched approximation on the lattice . here",
    "we calculate them by using @xmath9 flavor domain wall fermion configurations . for the valence quark , we use overlap fermions .",
    "previous lattice calculations focused on diquarks composed of the light up and down quarks . in this work",
    "we consider diquarks composed of a strange and a light quark as well as of two light quarks .",
    "diquark correlations are induced by spin dependent interactions .",
    "thus they become weaker as the masses of quark increase .",
    "we can look into the mass dependence of diquark correlations by varying the current quark masses on the lattice .",
    "our results of the diquark mass difference and diquark quark mass difference are summaried in tab .",
    "[ tab : summary ] . in general",
    "they agree with the estimations in ref .",
    "the exception is the scalar diquark and strange quark mass difference for diquarks composed of a strange and a light quark .",
    "our result of this difference is smaller than the estimation in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we present the details of our calculation .",
    "the results and discussion are given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally we summarize in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the two quarks in the scalar diquark ( @xmath10 ) in the color antitriplet representation are attractive to each other as favored by perturbative one gluon exchange  @xcite and by instanton interactions  @xcite .",
    "it is often called a  good \" diquark .",
    "the next favored diquark is the axial vector diquark ( @xmath11 ) and is called a  bad \" diquark .",
    "the other diquarks with @xmath12 are supposed to be even energetic and therefore their masses are higher . the diquarks in the color sextet representation have much larger color electrostatic field energy and are not favored by various models  @xcite .    therefore we focus on the color antitriplet diquarks and calculate their masses on the lattice .",
    "the interpolating operators used in this work for diquarks with various quantum numbers are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : currents ] , where @xmath13 is the charge conjugation operator . in the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    ".interpolating fields and correlation functions of diquarks .",
    "a trace is performed in color space . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : summary ]    in the chiral limit of the valence quark mass , we find the diquark mass difference @xmath18 mev and diquark quark mass difference @xmath19 mev for diquarks composed of two light quarks . for diquarks composed of a strange and a light quark , we obtain @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 mev . here when there are two uncertainties , the first one is statistical and the second one is a systematic error estimated from different extrapolations to the chiral limit or from light sea quark mass dependence . in general , the results of these mass differences agree with the estimations from hadron spectroscopy in ref .",
    "the exception is @xmath21 mev for the scalar diquark composed of a strange and an up quark , which is smaller than the estimation @xmath22 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to better control the light sea quark mass dependence and finite lattice spacing effects in our work , calculations at another sea quark mass are needed , and more statistics on the fine lattice should be added .",
    "it might be interesting to calculate these differences in other gauges to check the gauge dependence .",
