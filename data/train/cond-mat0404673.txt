    "the fabrication of ordered arrays of self - assembled , three - dimensional ( 3d ) nanosized islands is the subject of intense research in recent times due to their possible applications in the fields of nanomagnetism and optoelectronics.@xcite to obtain semiconducting `` quantum dots '' that can be efficiently used as lasers and light - emitting diodes , it is convenient to grow islands which are _ coherent _ with the atomic layers underneath , i.e. , that do not contain misfit dislocations ( mds ) .",
    "one promising approach to the fabrication of such structures is to exploit the `` coherent stranski - krastanov ( sk ) growth '' in the epitaxy of highly mismatched materials .",
    "this case is different from the `` classical '' sk growth in which the lattice mismatch is accommodated by mds at the interface with the wetting layer.@xcite the term `` coherent '' sk growth has been coined for this case of formation of 3d islands that are strained to fit the underlying strained wetting layer of the same material at the interface but are largely strain - free near their top and side walls.@xcite it has been recently reported in a series of systems , e.g. ge on si,@xcite inas on gaas,@xcite ingaas on gaas,@xcite inp on in@xmath0ga@xmath0p,@xcite that coherently strained ( dislocation - free ) 3d islands grow on the wetting layer . in all these cases ,",
    "the lattice misfit is positive and very large ( 4.2 , 7.2 and about 3.8  % for ge / si , inas / gaas and inp / in@xmath0ga@xmath0p , respectively ) for semicoductor materials , which are characterized by directional and brittle chemical bonds . a possible ( partial ) exception might be the system pbse / pbte(111 ) , where the misfit is negative ( -5.5  % ) and the overlayer is expanded.@xcite    the growth of thin epitaxial films takes place usually in conditions far from equilibrium , particularly when using deposition methods in vacuum like molecular beam epitaxy . nevertheless , thermodynamic considerations are a necessary step to understand many aspects of the growth process",
    ". of particular interest for the case of the coherent sk growth is the thermodynamic driving force ( tdf ) responsible for the 3d islanding .",
    "the reason is that we have in fact the growth of @xmath1 on strained @xmath1 , the coherent 3d islands being strained to the same degree as the wetting layer .",
    "a naive conclusion from this would be that the energy of the interfacial boundary between the 3d islands and the wetting layer is equal to zero .",
    "although this energy is certainly expected to be small compared to the free energy of the crystal faces involved  @xcite , it can not be neglected since this would imply that the islands wet completely the wetting layer , ruling out 3d islanding from a thermodynamic point of view  @xcite .    the need for a thermodynamic analysis arises also from the experimental observation of a critical misfit for coherent 3d islanding,@xcite and the simultaneous presence of islands of different thicknesses which vary by one monolayer ( ml).@xcite the existence of a critical misfit , as well as of stable two- , three- or four - ml - thick islands , do not follow from the tradeoff  @xcite @xmath2 between the cost of the additional surface energy and the gain of energy due to the elastic relaxation of the 3d islands relative to the wetting layer ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the islands volume , the specific surface energy and the lattice misfit , respectively , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants ) .    for these reasons",
    ", in this chapter we first recall some simple thermodynamic aspects of the epitaxial morphology based on the traditional concept of wetting and consider the coherent sk growth from this point of view .",
    "the basic ideas are then supported by numerical calculations that make use of a simple model in @xmath8 dimensions with anharmonic interactions .    in order for the 3d islands to be useful for technical applications",
    ", they have to be produced with high areal densities and with a high degree of similarity and homogeneity .",
    "experimental studies of arrays of coherent 3d islands of highly mismatched semiconductor materials have shown surprisingly narrow size distributions.@xcite this phenomenon , known as self - assembly,@xcite is highly desirable as it guarantees a specific optical wavelength of the array of quantum dots .    in the second part of this chapter ,",
    "we address the topic of self - assembly . we consider no longer single isolated islands , but groups of islands on top of a deformable wetting layer consisting of several atomic planes that are allowed to relax in response to the strain fields produced by the misfitting islands . in this way",
    ", elastic interactions between the islands can be studied .",
    "we will focus on the wetting of islands that are part of an array , i.e. , that are surrounded by neighbouring islands .",
    "we study the effect of the density of the array ( the distance to the nearest neighbouring islands ) , the size distribution ( the difference in size of the neighbouring islands ) and the shape distribution ( the slope of the side walls of the neighbouring islands ) on the wetting parameter @xmath9 of the considered island .",
    "the results are finally discussed and compared to experiments .",
    "we consider two different phases .",
    "the first is one which we can call a mother or ambient phase .",
    "we can think of it as the vapour phase .",
    "the second is a condensed phase and can consist either of a strained planar film or of unstrained 3d crystals .",
    "a fundamental thermodynamical result is that two phases are in equilibrium with each other when their chemical potentials are equal .",
    "a transition from one phase to a second one takes place when the chemical potential of the second becomes smaller than that of the first .",
    "the tdf for the transition is thus the difference of the chemical potentials of both phases at the given pressure and temperature .",
    "therefore , the tdf which determines the occurrence of one or another mechanism of epitaxial growth ( i.e. , the growth of a coherently strained 2d layer or of 3d crystallites ) is the difference    @xmath10    of the chemical potential of the overlayer @xmath11 , which depends on the average film thickness ( measured in number @xmath12 of monolayers counted from the interface ) , and the chemical potential , @xmath13 , of the bulk 3d crystal of the same material.@xcite    the thickness dependence of the film chemical potential @xmath11 originates from the thickness distribution of the misfit strain and from the interaction between the deposit and the substrate , which rapidly decreases with the distance from the interface and can usually be neglected beyond several mls.@xcite    we can describe the essential phenomenology in terms of the wetting considering a simple model of epitaxial growth of a crystal a on a substrate b. at this stage , we do not include any lattice misfit between the two materials but only a difference in the strength of the chemical bonding .",
    "as is well known , the wetting parameter which accounts for the energetic influence of the crystal b on a is defined as ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energies per atom required to disjoin a half - crystal a from a like half - crystal a and from an unlike half - crystal b , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential of the bulk crystal a is given at zero temperature by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the work required to detach an atom from the well known kink or half - crystal position .",
    "this name is due to the fact that an atom at this position is bound to a half - atomic row , a half - crystal plane and a half - crystal block.@xcite in the case of a monolayer - thick film of a on the surface of b , the chemical potential of an atom a is given by the analogous term @xmath19 whereby the underlying half - crystal block of a has been replaced by a half - crystal block of b. therefore we have    @xmath20    in the simplest case of additivity of the energies of lateral and vertical bonds , this difference reduces to @xmath21 as the lateral bondings cancel each other ( it is easy to show that eq .",
    "[ delta ] is equivalent to the well known 3-@xmath22 criterion of bauer  @xcite ) .",
    "then @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath9:@xcite    @xmath24    it follows that it is in fact the wetting parameter @xmath9 which determines the mechanism of growth of a on b@xcite as illustrated by figure  [ grmodes ] .",
    "we first consider two limiting cases .",
    "the volmer - weber ( vw ) growth of isolated 3d islands of a on the surface of b takes place at any misfit @xmath25 and is characterized by the incomplete wetting of the substrate ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is always positive and decreases asymptotically to zero with increasing thickness .",
    "the opposite limit is the consecutive formation of mls of a on b in the frank - van der merwe ( fw ) growth , with complete wetting ( @xmath28 ) . for this mode of growth",
    "is required that @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", @xmath23 is always negative and tends asymptotically to zero with increasing thickness .",
    "schematic dependence of the film chemical potential on the film thickness in monolayers for the three classical modes of growth : vw  volmer - weber , sk  stranski - krastanov , and fm  frank - van der merwe.,width=302 ]    also shown in figure  [ grmodes ] is the intermediate and important case of the sk mode of growth , which takes place when the atoms of the deposit bind stronger to those of the substrate than to themselves ( @xmath30 ) but the lattice misfit @xmath31 is substantial .",
    "the first condition causes a complete wetting at the beginning of the growth ( @xmath32 ) but the second produces an accumulation of strain energy with increasing film thickness which turns the balance towards @xmath33 ( incomplete wetting ) at some value of the thickness @xmath12 . in the classical sk growth , the introduction of mds allows for a release of strain energy through a structural relaxation of the film and to the development of 3d islands .",
    "it is instructive to consider also fig .",
    "[ grmodes ] in terms of equilibrium vapour pressures .",
    "although the connection with the chemical potential is straightforward ( @xmath34 ) , this gives a deeper insight into the problem .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath35 a thin planar film can be deposited at a vapour pressure @xmath36 smaller than the equilibrium vapour pressure @xmath37 of the bulk crystal , but larger than the equilibrium vapour pressure @xmath38 of the first ml , i.e. @xmath39 . in other words ,",
    "a planar film can be deposited at _ undersaturation _",
    "@xmath40 with respect to the bulk crystal .",
    "the formation of 3d islands [ @xmath41 requires @xmath42 , or a _ supersaturation _ with respect to the bulk crystal .",
    "we thus conclude that the 3d islands and the wetting layer represent necessarily different phases and thus have different chemical potentials .",
    "the reason is that the two phases are in equilibrium with the mother phase under different conditions which never overlap.@xcite the wetting layer can be in equilibrium only with an undersaturated vapour phase ( @xmath43 ) , while small 3d islands can be in equilibrium only with a supersaturated vapour phase ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the dividing line is thus @xmath44 at which the wetting layer can not grow thicker and the 3d islands can not nucleate and grow .",
    "hence the wetting layer and the 3d islands can never be in equilibrium with each other .",
    "the derivative , @xmath45 , of the energy of the 3d islands relative to that of the wetting layer , gives the difference of the chemical potentials of the wetting layer and the chemical potential of the 3d islands .",
    "in other words , it represents the difference of the supersaturations of the vapour phase with respect to the wetting layer and the 3d islands .",
    "transfer of material from the stable wetting layer defined by @xmath46 to the 3d islands is connected with an increase of the free energy of the system and therefore is thermodynamically unfavoured .",
    "a planar film thicker than the stable wetting layer is unstable and the excess of the material must be transferred to the 3d islands if the necessary thermal activation exists .",
    "the stranski - krastanov morphology appears as a results of the interplay of the film - substrate bonding , misfit strain and the surface energies . a wetting layer with a thickness of the order of the range of the interatomic forces is first formed ( owing to the interplay of the a - b interaction and the strain energy accumulation ) on top of which partially or completely relaxed 3d islands nucleate and grow .",
    "the 3d islands and the thermodynamically stable wetting layer represent necessarily different phases .",
    "if this were not the case , the growth would continue by 2d layers .",
    "thus we can consider as a useful approximation to regard the 3d islanding on top of the uniformly strained wetting layer as a volmer - weber growth . that requires the mean adhesion of the atoms that belong to the base plane of the 3d islands to the stable wetting layer to be smaller than the cohesion between them .",
    "in other words , the wetting of the underlying wetting layer by the 3d islands must be incomplete .",
    "otherwise , 3d islanding will not occur.@xcite in the volmer - weber growth the incomplete wetting is due mainly to the difference in bonding ( @xmath47 ) , the supplementary effect of the lattice misfit being usually smaller . in the classical sk growth ,",
    "the incomplete wetting is due to the energetic cost of the array of mds .    in view of this",
    ", the case of _ coherent _ sk growth seems difficult to understand , since in the absence of mds there is no obvious difference between the atoms of the wetting layer and those of the islands .",
    "if this is so , then there is no evident reason for the consideration of two different phases , the wetting must be complete and 3d islanding should not occur.@xcite     graphical representation of the atomic interaction potential , of the morse type , used in the calculations in this work.,width=302 ]    it has been recently suggested that the tdf for the _ coherent _ sk growth , where @xmath48 , is the incomplete wetting of the substrate by the islands.@xcite the origin of the reduced adhesion are the displacements of the atoms near the island edges from the bottoms of the corresponding potential troughs provided by the wetting layer underneath . however , the approximation used by the authors , which is based on the 1d model of frenkel and kontorova,@xcite is unable to describe correctly the individual behaviour of atoms inside each layer , since it assumes a potential with a period given by the average of the separations of atoms ( considered frozen ) in the layer underneath .",
    "although this model gives qualitatively reasonable results concerning the energy of the islands , it is inadequate to calculate , in particular , the structure and energy of the interfacial boundary between the wetting layer and the 3d islands upon thickening of the latter .",
    "the model is further unable to consider the effect of neighbouring islands on the wetting of a given one .",
    "for the above - mentioned reasons , we have performed atomistic calculations making use of a simple minimization procedure .",
    "the atoms interact through a pair potential whose anharmonicity can be varied by adjusting two constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) that govern separately the repulsive and the attractive branches , respectively,@xcite @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the equilibrium atom separation . for @xmath54 the potential ( [ potent ] ) turns into the familiar morse form , which has been used in the present work for the particular case @xmath55 .",
    "this potential is shown in figure  [ vmorse ] .     schematic view of ( a ) an isolated island on a rigid substrate with side angles of 60@xmath56 and ( b ) an array of islands on a wetting layer .",
    "the central island is surrounded by two islands with different shapes and sizes .",
    "the distance between neighbouring islands is given by  @xmath57.,width=302 ]    our programs calculate the interaction energy of all the atoms as well as its gradient with respect to the atomic coordinates , i.e. the forces .",
    "relaxation of the system is performed by allowing the atoms to displace in the direction of the gradient in an iterative procedure until the forces fall below some negligible cutoff value .",
    "the calculations for isolated islands were performed under the assumption that the substrate ( the wetting layer ) is rigid .",
    "it was carefully checked that removing this restriction , i.e. , allowing several layers below the islands to relax did not change qualitatively the results .",
    "we consider an atomistic model in @xmath8 dimensions which can be regarded as a cross - section of the real @xmath58 case .",
    "an implicit assumption is that the islands have a compact rather than a fractal shape and that the lattice misfit is the same in both orthogonal directions .",
    "the 3d islands are represented by linear chains of atoms stacked one upon the other  @xcite as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) .",
    "the shape of the islands in our model is given by the slope of the side walls .",
    "in the case of arrays of islands , the restriction of a rigid substrate must obviously be lifted in order for it to mediate elastic interactions between the islands .",
    "the 1 + 1-dimensional array is represented by a row of 3 ( occasionally 5 ) islands on a wetting layer consisting of several mls which are allowed to relax .",
    "the distance between two neighbouring islands is given by the number @xmath57 of vacant atomic positions between the ends of their base chains , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ scheme](b ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in the lateral direction .    for the sake of simplicity in the computational procedure , we consider in our model",
    "a wetting layer that is in fact composed of several mls of the true wetting layer of the overlayer material a plus several mls of the unlike substrate material b. this  composite wetting layer \" has the atom spacing of the substrate material b as in the real case , but the atom bonding of the overlayer material a. this underestimates somewhat the value of @xmath9 , because the a - a bonding is necessarily weaker than the b - b bonding in order for sk growth to be possible , but it does not introduce a significant error since the energetic influence of the substrate b is screened by the true wetting layer a.    in the present work , we will be primarily concerned with the wetting .",
    "it is therefore important to define precisely the wetting parameter  @xmath59 . in the coherent sk",
    "the relation between @xmath60 and @xmath9 is not as simple as that given by eq .",
    "[ dmueaaphi ] , because the bond energies are generally not additive , the misfit strain is relaxed mostly near the side and top walls and increasing the island thickness leads to larger displacements of the edge atoms , as will be shown below . for these reasons , in this work we define the wetting parameter @xmath9 as the difference of the interaction energies with the wetting layer of misfitting and non - misfitting 3d islands .",
    "we first consider the characteristics of the adhesion between the _ coherent _ 3d islands and the wetting layer .",

    "it can be seen that the end atoms are strongly displaced as in the model of frenkel and kontorova,@xcite and of frank and van der merwe.@xcite increasing the island height leads to larger displacements of the end atoms .",

    "the vertical displacements are largest at the chain s ends in the coherent sk mode and around the dislocation cores in the classical case , but the physics is essentially the same . in both cases we find a reduction of the adhesion which leads to the 3d islanding .",

    "moreover , it is a clear evidence of why compressed rather than expanded overlayers exhibit greater tendency to coherent sk growth .",
    "another consequence of the atomic displacements shown in fig .",

    "the wetting parameter increases very slowly and is nearly equal to zero up to about 12  % for expanded overlayers , whereas it increases steeply beyond a value of the misfit of approximately 5  % in compressed overlayers .",
    "as will be shown below , this is in agreement with the misfit dependence of the critical size ( volume ) for the mono - bilayer transformation to occur .",
    "an additional proof that the tdf for coherent 3d islanding is the reduced adhesion is obtained by studying the energies of 2d and 3d islands as a function of the total number of atoms or the volume .",
    "a direct consequence of such a study is the existence of a critical misfit beyond which coherent 3d islanding can take place .",
    "we compare the energies per atom of mono- and multilayer high islands with different thickness increasing discretely by one monolayer .",
    "one of the reason for doing this is that islands with different thickness have different adhesion parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ phivsh ] ) . moreover , as shown by stoyanov and markov , such an approach originates from the classical concept of minimum of the surface energy at a fixed volume.@xcite it is particularly applicable to small crystallites formed on unlike surfaces where the crystal height is a discrete rather than a continuous variable .",

    "the growth will continue in a layer - by - layer mode until misfit dislocations are introduced at the interface to relax the strain .",
    "the much larger absolute value of the negative critical misfit is obviously due to the anharmonicity of the atomic interactions .",

    "[ n123arr ] .",
    "the total energy for islands inside an array shows the same behaviour as for isolated islands .",
    "this means that also in the case of a deformable substrate , the overall transformation from the precursor 2d islands to the 3d islands takes place in consecutive stages in each of which the islands thicken by one monolayer .",
    "the energies computed in the case of the reference single islands always lie below the curves of the islands in an array .",

    "for the discussion of the above results we have to bear in mind that a positive value of the wetting parameter implies in fact a tendency of the deposit to form 3d clusters instead of a planar film .    we conclude that in the coherent sk growth the incomplete wetting is due to the reduced adhesion of the edge atoms as a result of the lattice misfit .",
    "this effect is the tdf for the coherent 3d islanding .",
    "the interfacial energy of the boundary between the wetting layer and the 3d crystallites is not zero and can not be neglected .",
    "this is confirmed by the effect of the anharmonicity of the atomic interactions .",
    "the stronger repulsive forces between the atoms in the compressed overlayers lead to larger lateral and vertical displacements , and in turn , to weaker wetting in comparison with films that are under tensile stress .",
    "expanded islands adhere stronger to the wetting layer and the tdf is very small to produce 3d islands . as a result , coherent sk growth in expanded films could be expected at very ( unrealistically ) large absolute values of the negative misfit .",

    "the sharp increase of the tdf with the misfit in compressed overlayers ( fig .",
    "[ phivsf ] ) leads to the appearance of a critical misfit beyond which 3d islanding is possible .",
    "the existence of a critical misfit clearly shows that the origin of the 3d islanding in the coherent sk growth is the incomplete wetting , which in turn is due to the atomic displacements near the islands edges .",
    "et al_.@xcite have successfully grown quantum dots of in@xmath76ga@xmath77as on gaas(001 ) with @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) but 60   thick 2d quantum wells at @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "upon deposition of si@xmath0ge@xmath0 films on relaxed buffer layers of si@xmath76ge@xmath77 with varying composition.@xcite    the increase of @xmath64 with decreasing absolute value of the misfit ( fig .",
    "[ n12vsf ] ) in overlayers under tensile stress is not as sharp as in compressed ones and the critical behaviour is not clearly pronounced in this particular case . comparing figs .",
    "[ phivsf ] and [ n12vsf ] clearly shows the reason for this behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , we could expect a critical - like behaviour in experiments . pinczolits _",
    "et al_.@xcite have found that deposition of pbse@xmath77te@xmath76 on pbte(111 ) remains purely two dimensional when the misfit is less than 1.6  % in absolute value ( se content @xmath84 ) .",
    "in addition to the need of a sufficiently weak adhesion , the existence of a critical misfit appears as a result of the consideration of the island height as a discrete rather than a continuous variable .",
    "the latter is also the reason for the complete 2d-3d transformation to pass through a series of intermediate states with discretely increasing thickness .",
    "these states are thermodynamically stable in consecutive intervals of the volume .",
    "the first step of these transformations is the rearrangement of monolayer - high islands into bilayer islands .",
    "thus the 2d islands appear as natural precursors for the formation of 3d islands beyond some critical size .",
    "et al_. reported a sudden decrease of the surface coverage from 1.75 to 1.2 ml at the moment of formation of inas 3d islands on gaas.@xcite the same phenomenon has been noticed by shklyaev _",
    "et al_. in the case of ge / si(111).@xcite voigtlnder and zinner noted that ge 3d islands in ge / si(111 ) epitaxy have been observed at the same locations where 2d islands locally exceeded the critical wetting layer thickness of 2 bilayers@xcite .",
    "et al_. found that the volume distribution of inas / gaas self - assembled quantum dots agrees well with the scaling function characteristic of monolayer - high islands in submonolayer epitaxy.@xcite    the question of the existence and particularly the stability of the intermediate states is more difficult to answer .",
    "_ measured photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of inas layers deposited on inp(001 ) at two different temperatures ( 490 and 525@xmath56c ) and buried in the same material.@xcite when the layers were grown at 490@xmath56c and the capping layer was deposited immediately after the deposition of the inas , the spectrum consisted of a single line .",
    "if the inas layer was annealed for 10  s before capping with inp , the spectrum consisted of 8 lines . at 525@xmath56c ,",
    "3 lines were observed already in absence of annealing .",
    "the above observations could be explained by the formation and coexistence of islands with different thickness varying by one monolayer .",
    "et al._@xcite performed pl studies of inas deposits on gaas(001 ) with thicknesses slightly varying around the critical thickness of 1.6  ml for the onset of the 3d islanding .",
    "they observed an increasing number of luminescence lines with increasing film thickness .",
    "these lines were attributed to families of 3d islands with similar shape but with heights differing by one monolayer .    although the above results seem to be in an excellent qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions of the model , the thermodynamic stability of islands with quantized height of one monolayer , and the existence of a critical misfit is still debated.@xcite the reason of the discrepancy of our results with those of duport _",
    "et al._@xcite most probably stems from the implicit assumption , made by the above authors , that the lengths of the lower ( @xmath85 ) and the upper ( @xmath86 ) bases , and particularly the height ( @xmath87 ) of the crystal they consider , which has the shape of a frustum of a pyramid , are continuous variables .",
    "this is correct if the crystals are sufficiently large .",
    "however , the continuum approximation is not acceptable in the beginning of the 2d-3d transformation when the islands are still very small ( and thin ) .",
    "it is also not applicable in the limit @xmath88 for the same reason .",
    "the problem is in fact analogous to the applicability of the classical nucleation theory to small clusters .",
    "a cluster of a given finite size is stable in a finite interval rather than for a fixed value of the supersaturation .",
    "these intervals decrease with increasing cluster size and become negligibly small when the clusters are so large that the classical theory of nucleation becomes valid.@xcite in the same way the continuum approximation with @xmath88 should be applicable to much larger islands consisting of several million of atoms .    considering the self - assembly ,",
    "the presence of neighbouring islands , particularly of those highly compact ( with largest angle facets ) , in the near vicinity of a certain island decreases the adhesion of the latter .",
    "the transformation of 2d , monolayer - high islands into bilayer islands takes place by detachment of atoms from the edges and their subsequent jumping and nucleating on the top island s surface.@xcite this edge effect shows the influence of the lattice misfit on the rate of second layer nucleation and in turn on the kinetics of the 2d-3d transformation.@xcite the presence of neighbouring islands favours the formation of 3d clusters and their further growth . for the self - assembled monodisperse population ,",
    "the highest tendency to clustering is found .",
    "we can regard the flatter islands in our model ( 11@xmath56 facet angle ) as the  hut \" clusters discovered by mo _",
    "et al._,@xcite and the clusters with 60@xmath56 facet angle as the  dome \" clusters .",
    "it is well known that clusters with steeper side walls relieve the strain more efficiently than flatter clusters  @xcite ( a planar film , the limiting case of the flat islands , does not relieve strain at all ) .",
    "we see that large - angle facet islands affect more strongly the growth of the neighbouring islands , leading to a more narrow size distribution .",
    "our results lead us to expect a self - assembled population of quantum dots with highest density at low temperatures such that the critical wetting layer thickness for 3d islanding approaches an integer number of mls . in inas",
    "/ gaas quantum dots the reported values of the critical thickness vary from 1.2 to 2  ml.@xcite the critical wetting layer thickness is given by an integer number @xmath12 of mls plus the product of the 2d island density and the critical volume @xmath64 in the ( @xmath12 + 1)-th  ml .",
    "the 2d island density increases steeply with decreasing temperature.@xcite in such a case a dense population of 2d islands will overcome simultaneously the critical size @xmath64 to produce bilayer islands .",
    "the value of @xmath64 will be slightly reduced when neighbouring islands are present due to the increase of @xmath62 .",
    "regions of high adatom concentrations will favour the highest degree of self - assembly and , due to the larger elastic forces present , are also likely to promote the spatial ordering of the islands , possibly extending to less dense regions and leading to self - organized arrays .",
    "islands will thus interact with each other from the very beginning of the 2d-3d transformation and will give rise to the maximum possible wetting parameter and , in turn , to islands with large - angle facets and a narrow size distribution .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations of self - assembled ge quantum dots on si(001).@xcite at 700@xmath56c a population of islands with a concentration ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90 @xmath91 is obtained .",
    "the islands have the shape of truncated square pyramids with their side wall facets formed by ( 105 ) planes ( inclination angle of about 11@xmath56 ) .",
    "the size distribution of the islands is quite broad . at 550@xmath56c a population of islands with an areal density of the order of @xmath92 to @xmath93 @xmath91",
    "is observed .",
    "the islands have larger - angle ( 113 ) facets and their size distribution is much more narrow .",
    "summarizing , the wetting layer and the 3d islands represent different phases which can not be in equilibrium with each other and the sk morphology is a result of the replacement of one first order phase transition ( vapour  wetting layer ) by another first order transition ( vapour  3d islands ) .",
    "the transfer of matter from the stable wetting layer to the 3d islands is thermodynamically unfavoured .",
    "the experimental observations can be explained on the base of two assumptions : the thermodynamic driving force for the coherent 3d islanding is the incomplete wetting and the height of the 3d islands is a discrete variable varying by one monolayer .",
    "this leads to the results that ( i ) monolayer - high islands with a critical size appear as necessary precursors for 3d islands , ( ii ) the 2d-3d transition takes place through a series of intermediate states with discretely increasing thickness that are stable in separate intervals of volume ( iii ) there exists a critical misfit below which coherent 3d islands are thermodynamically unfavoured and the misfit is accommodated by misfit dislocations at a later stage of the growth .",
    "compressed overlayers show a greater tendency to 3d clustering than expanded ones , in agreement with experimental results .",
    "an open question is the mechanism by which the 3d nucleation takes place on top of the wetting layer .",
    "it is well known that a one - dimensional model is inadequate for the treatment of this case , since it will always give a critical nucleus size of one atom.@xcite we are confident that in the future , a generalization of our energy minimization model to 2 + 1 dimensions will allow us to study the 3d nucleation problem in the coherent sk growth .",
    "finally , the presence of neighbouring islands decreases the wetting of the substrate ( in this case the wetting layer ) by the 3d islands",
    ". the wetting decreases with increasing array density and facet angle of the neighbouring islands . the wetting parameter displays a maximum ( implying a minimal wetting ) when the array shows a monodisperse size distribution .",
    "we expect an optimum self - assembled islanding at low temperatures such that the 2d-3d transformation takes place at the highest possible island density .",
