    "based on the ads / cft  @xcite , many successful attempts have been made to construct a holographic model of qcd , in both the bottom - up  @xcite and the top - down@xcite approaches .",
    "baryons are also introduced into both of the approaches  @xcite .",
    "since it has been generally expected that the physical properties of hadrons undergo a significant change in the finite temperature and/or density environment , finite temperature extension of the approaches have been of great interest .",
    "one of the interesting approaches is to use the ads black hole .",
    "however , according to the hawking - page transition analysis done in @xcite , the ads black hole is unstable at low temperature and the thermal ads metric is energetically favored in the confining phase  @xcite . in general , the thermal ads background will not render any temperature dependence of any physical quantities in confined phase , since the metric , thermal ads , is not globally modified compared to those at zero temperature , ads .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that in low - temperature confined phase , the properties of hadrons show no significant changes compared to zero temperature .",
    "this means that , in the light of the hawking - page transition , the ads / qcd model may not be of much use , when it comes to the temperature dependence of physical quantities such as meson and baryon masses .",
    "as long as we are taking @xmath2 limit , the observation of the hawking - page transition analysis is consistent with large @xmath3 qcd  @xcite . in real world",
    ", however , the properties of hadrons , in confined phase , are modified at finite temperature , see  @xcite for examples . in the light of the hawking - page , we could think of such a temperature dependence as a consequence of large @xmath3 corrections in an ads / qcd approach .",
    "we note here that up to now , however , such large @xmath3 corrections have not been successfully included in ads / qcd @xcite . in this work we propose a simple way to introduce a temperature dependence through the chiral condensate in the frame work of the hard wall model  @xcite .    the chiral symmetry of qcd has been playing an important role in hadron physics .",
    "a pertinent order parameter for the symmetry is the chiral condensate @xmath4 .",
    "there has been any amount of research on the chiral condensate at finite temperature and density in the framework of qcd effective theories or models .",
    "one of the interesting questions regarding the chiral condensate is : what is the effect of the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry on the physical quantities such as meson and baryon masses ?    in a bottom - up ads / qcd model ,",
    "the chiral condensate is encoded in a 5d profile of a scalar field @xmath5 that couples to quark bilinear @xmath6 at the boundary of ads@xmath7 .",
    "the background geometry of the hard wall model  @xcite is defined as a slice of anti - de sitter ( ads ) metric , @xmath8 where @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the uv - cutoff and @xmath11 for the ir - cutoff . in the hard wall mode",
    "@xcite the vacuum expectation of the scalar @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integration constants to be fixed by boundary conditions . according to an ads / cft dictionary , @xmath14 is identified with current quark mass , @xmath16 , and @xmath15 is interpreted as the chiral condensate , @xmath17 @xmath18 . in this work we will set @xmath19 , no explicit chiral symmetry breaking , and take @xmath15 as a free parameter of the model . in the hard wall model , the correspondence @xmath17 @xmath18 is realized by imposing the ir boundary condition : @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "we vary the value of @xmath15 from a finite value to zero to mimic a chiral symmetry restoration in a specific environment such as qcd at finite temperature .",
    "our primary goal in this study is to observe how physical quantities depend on the change of the chiral condensate , which is , in turn , supposed to address the consequences of the ( partial ) restoration of chiral symmetry to the physical quantities of qcd effective theories at low energy .",
    "one of the interesting observations as a consequence of chiral symmetry restoration is the scaling behavior of the hadron properties at finite temperature and/or density . for examples ,",
    "njl model gives  @xcite , [ nambuscaling ] and br scaling  @xcite reads .[brscaling ] here @xmath21 is for temperature / density dependent quantities .",
    "as described in @xcite , the chiral condensate in the hard wall model is an integration constant to be fixed by the ir boundary condition : @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "it has been known  @xcite that the value of the chiral condensate changes with temperature .",
    "therefore we can define a hard wall model at finite temperature with the following ir boundary condition : @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the temperature dependent chiral condensate .",
    "this is a proposal in this work as a simple way to introduce a temperature dependence in the hard wall model by imposing a ir boundary condition defined at finite temperature .",
    "we can not , however , determine the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate in a self - consistent way within the hard wall model",
    ". therefore , as done in zero temperature case  @xcite , we have to consider @xmath26 as an input , and take the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate from a qcd effective theory or lattice qcd study .",
    "this is a limitation of the present study .",
    "once the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate is given , however , we can easily obtain the temperature dependence of the other physical quantities such as the nucleon mass and the pion decay constant .",

    "@xmath34 is the 5d gauge coupling , @xmath35 , @xmath10 is the uv - cutoff and @xmath11 is for the ir - cutoff . in  @xcite ,",
    "the ir - cutoff @xmath11 is fixed by the @xmath36-meson mass : @xmath37 .",
    "the vector- and axial - vector mesons are defined by @xmath38 to define our scaling factor @xmath39 , we solve the equation of motion for @xmath40 , x_0=0 ,   x_0=c_1z + c_2z^3 , [ eomx ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integration constants .",
    "we define @xmath41 .",
    "an ads / cft dictionary dictates that @xmath14 is nothing but the source term , current quark mass @xmath42 , and @xmath15 should be interpreted as the chiral condensate , the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking / restoration . in this work ,",
    "we take @xmath23 .",
    "then , we have c_1=0 ,  c_2= , where @xmath39 is a free parameter of the model .",
    "note that @xmath43 is compatible with phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "we scale down @xmath39 from @xmath44 to zero .",
    "we first consider the scaling of vector and axial - vector meson masses as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the relevant equations of motions for the transverse component of the vector and axial - vector bulk fields are , after the kaluza - klein reduction of the bulk field , @xmath45 , & & f_n^v(z)=0 , [ eomv ] + & & f_n^a(z)=0[eoma ] , where @xmath46 . as in @xcite , we impose the following boundary conditions : @xmath47 .",
    "since the equation of motion for the vector is blind to @xmath48 , due to @xmath49 , the 4d mass of the vector meson @xmath50 such as @xmath36-meson mass will not scale with @xmath39 . while , the mass of axial - vector mesons will change with varying @xmath39 .",
    "we plot the mass of the lowest lying vector and axial vector mesons , @xmath36 and @xmath51 , in fig .  [",
    "mar ] . as in fig .",
    "[ mar ] , we have @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the role of the term with @xmath54 in eq .",

    "now we discuss the pion decay constant .",
    "the pion decay constant is defined by  @xcite f_^2=- |_z = z_0 , [ fpd ] where @xmath56 is the solution of the following equation , a(0,z)=0 .[fpa ] the scaling behavior of @xmath57 is shown in fig .",
    "[ mnft ] together with that of nucleon .",
    "finally , we delve into the scaling behavior of the nucleon mass with @xmath39 . the model  @xcite is extended to include baryons in ref .",

    "writing @xmath65 and similarly for @xmath66 , where @xmath67 are the components of the 4d spinor @xmath68 with mass @xmath69 to be determined , we have @xmath70 with the ir boundary condition @xmath71  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "note that as in the case of axial vector meson mass , @xmath51 , in fig .",
    "[ mar ] , the role of @xmath40 in the baryon mode equation becomes negligible at @xmath74 and the mass of nucleon is almost zero at and after @xmath74 .",
    "we recast fig .",
    "[ mnf ] in fig .",
    "[ mnf3 ] , where @xmath75 is used for the horizontal axis . from fig .",
    "[ mnf3 ] , we can see the the overall scaling behavior of @xmath76 is not much different from @xmath77 .",
    "a salient feature of the hard wall model is that the vector meson mass , for example @xmath36-meson mass , is independent of the chiral condensate as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eomv ] ) , and therefore the mass of @xmath36 is blind to the restoration of chiral symmetry in the present approach . finally , we comment on the @xmath39-dependence of the scalar meson mass . in general , studying scalar excitations is not simple as they are sensitive to the potential of @xmath5",
    ". if we follow ref.@xcite , where a potential for @xmath5 is added on the ir , the mass of the first scalar resonance is degenerate with the massless pion as @xmath78 .",
    "in the previous section , we obtain an interesting scaling properties of physical quantities with respect to the chiral condensate in the hard wall model .",
    "the chiral condensate is identified as the integration constant , @xmath15 , fixed by a boundary condition in eq.([eomx ] ) .    in this section ,",
    "we propose a phenomenological way to introduce the temperature dependence of physical quantities in the hard wall model by imposing a boundary condition as a function of temperature @xmath79 .",
    "then we have @xmath80 , where @xmath21 is for temperature dependence . in general , in bottom - up ads / qcd approach , however , there is no established way to calculate the temperature dependence of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we have to take @xmath81 as an input and borrow the temperature dependence of @xmath39 from a model calculation or lattice qcd study .",
    "although it might be a limitation of the present study , once @xmath81 is given , we can easily obtain the temperature dependence of the other hadronic parameters such as the nucleon mass and the pion decay constant . here",
    "we focus on the temperature dependence of the pion decay constant .    as an example",
    ", we take @xmath82 by extrapolating the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate obtained from the chiral lagrangian  @xcite with two quark flavors in the chiral limit , which is presumably valid at low temperature . then we can obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath57 using eqs .",
    "( [ fpd ] ) and ( [ fpa ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp2 ] , the temperature dependence of the pion decay constant is calculated by adopting the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate obtained in a generalized njl model  @xcite with a finite current quark mass .",
    "now , we compare the temperature dependence of @xmath57 calculated in this model with the one from chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and from linear and non - linear sigma models @xcite .",
    "we note here that at low temperature or at the leading order in temperature @xmath79 , both studies  @xcite give the same results on the chiral condensate , = 1-[qc5 ] .",
    "we take the temperature dependent chiral condensate @xmath82 given in eq .",
    "( [ qc5 ] ) as an input and calculate the temperature dependence of the pion decay constant using eqs .",
    "( [ fpd ] ) and ( [ fpa ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fpt ] , we compare our @xmath83 with that from  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependent pion decay constant obtained in  @xcite at low temperature is given by = 1-[fp5 ] .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of @xmath57 in our work is weaker than the one from  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence obtained in the present work is only due to the temperature dependent chiral condensate .",
    "in addition to this , we expect some temperature dependence due to large @xmath3 corrections and from higher dimensional terms such as @xmath84 in the action of the hard wall model .",
    "finally , we remark that the temperature dependence obtained in the present study has some similarity with that from qcd sum rule at finite temperature , for instance , see @xcite . in thermal qcd sum rule ,",
    "the temperature dependence of condensates , _",
    "e.g. _ , chiral condensate , is taken from a model study or from lattice qcd , and it is conveyed to the ( part of ) temperature dependence of physical quantities such as hadron masses . since the temperature dependent chiral condensate used in this work and the one adopted in the thermal qcd sum rule studies",
    "are different , we do nt make a direct comparison of our result with that from @xcite .",
    "we note here that in thermal qcd sum rule  @xcite , the temperature dependence could have additional sources other than the chiral condensate such as the temperature dependent wilson coefficients or four - quark condensate .",
    "we have used the hard wall model to study the scaling property of physical quantities as we scale down the chiral condensate . by varying the value of the chiral condensate @xmath39 ,",
    "we study how the other physical parameters scale with @xmath39 , which is summarized in fig .",
    "we note here that the mass of @xmath36-meson is independent of the chiral condensate in the hard wall model  @xcite , and therefore it is blind to the restoration of the chiral symmetry in the present work .",
    "we have introduced the temperature into the ads / qcd model through the chiral condensate as an ir boundary condition . with a given temperature dependent chiral condensate @xmath81",
    ", we can easily predict the temperature dependence of other physical quantities such as hadron masses or decay constants . as an example , we have calculated the temperature dependence of the pion decay constant and compare our result with that from chiral perturbation theory at low temperature .",
    "we find that the temperature dependence of the pion decay constant predicted from the present study is weak compared to that from chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and from linear and non - linear sigma models  @xcite .",
