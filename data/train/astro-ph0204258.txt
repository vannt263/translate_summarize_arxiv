    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are now confirmed to be located at cosmological distances , and they are recognized as the most energetic explosion in the universe in terms of isotropic equivalent luminosity , while their origin still remains as a mystery .",
    "the redshift of one grb 990123 was @xmath13 , and its total energy emitted as gamma - rays , estimated by its energy flux and redshift , is @xmath14 erg assuming isotropic radiation ( kulkarni et al .",
    "this energy is equivalent to a rest mass energy of @xmath15 and it is almost impossible to explain by explosions of objects with stellar mass scale .",
    "this is why most researchers in this field now consider that grbs are likely strongly collimated , with a typical collimation factor of @xmath16 100 .",
    "it is then important to test this hypothesis by observations , for better understanding of the nature of grbs .",
    "a direct consequence for such grb collimation is that the rate of grb afterglows may be much higher than those associated with observable prompt grbs .",
    "grbs are believed to be produced by dissipation of kinetic energy of ultra - relativistic outflow from the central engine with a lorentz factor of @xmath171001000 .",
    "the outflow is eventually decelerated by interaction with interstellar matter , just like supernova remnants , to produce radiation called afterglows .",
    "after @xmath18 decreases to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the opening angle of the jet , the beaming of radiation is wider than that of outflow , thus the afterglow becomes observable from directions different from that of the original gamma - ray radiation . at the same time , the sideway expansion increases the opening angle of the jet from the original angle of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore a serendipitous search of grb afterglows without prompt grbs is an important test for the beaming of grbs ( rhoads 1997 ) .",
    "several efforts have been made in various wavebands .",
    "past x - ray surveys set a constraint of @xmath21 several ( grindlay 1999 ; greiner et al .",
    "2000 ) , where @xmath22 is the `` relative '' beaming factor , i.e. , the ratio of all afterglow rate including orphans to the rate of those with on - axis grbs . reflects the relative beaming of radiation between prompt grbs and typical afterglows detectable in an orphan afterglow search . ]",
    "perna & loeb ( 1998 ) set a crude upper limit on @xmath23 by radio source counts .",
    "schaefer ( 2002 ) searched a 264 deg@xmath4 field down to @xmath24 , but no afterglow candidate was found .",
    "the past survey for high - redshift supernovae should also give some constraint on the orphan grb afterglow rate ( e.g. , rees 1999 ) .",
    "recently , vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported a possible orphan afterglow found in the initial 1500 deg@xmath4 data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "however , gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported that the host galaxy of the sdss transient is a highly variable , radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and hence it was almost certainly not related to a grb .",
    "the interpretation of these results is , however , not straightforward .",
    "they must be compared with a realistic theoretical prediction of @xmath22 which is generally dependent on the waveband and sensitivity of surveys .",
    "recently , dalal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argued , based on a simple analytical investigation , that the value of @xmath22 is not sufficiently large for the sensitivity that can be achieved by the current facilities , even if grbs are strongly collimated . they also argued that the rate of orphan afterglows is insensitive to the jet opening angle , and hence they concluded that the orphan afterglow search hardly constrains the grb collimation in practice .",
    "what makes the situation even more complicated is the possibility that orphan afterglows can be produced by other processes rather than the collimation ; for example , a ` failed ' grb or a ` dirty fireball ' may produce afterglows at longer wavelength while there is no prompt gamma - ray emission ( huang , dai , & lu 2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a realistic prediction of orphan afterglow rate as a function of search sensitivity in various wavebands , based on a popular afterglow model of collimated grbs that has been tested against a number of afterglow observations .",
    "we find that the orphan afterglow rate rapidly increases with grb jet collimation roughly as @xmath25 , if grb jets have roughly constant energies against various @xmath20 , as suggested by recent studies ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the orphan afterglow search could still be powerful to get information on collimation of grb jets .",
    "even if the theoretical prediction is also affected by possible other components of ejecta from successful or failed grbs with lower lorentz factor , it would be useful to make a prediction for the abundance of orphan afterglows by the ` nominal ' ( i.e. , without any other hypothetical components ) jet model of grb afterglows , as realistic as possible , since the jet model is a relatively reliable method of transforming the on - axis light - curves to off - axis ones , compared with other theoretical possibilities of orphan afterglows .",
    "it can be used as a baseline prediction when one interprets the results of past and future searches for faint extragalactic transient objects .    to make plausible predictions , we take the observed radio , optical , and x - ray emission of ten grb afterglows with a wide variety of estimated jet opening angle",
    " 970508 , 980519 , 990123 , 990510 , 991208 , 991216 , 000301c , 000418 , 000926 , and 010222  and calculate their emission as it would be seen at various angles relative to the jet axis .",
    "this is done within the framework of collimated jets decelerated by the circumburst medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ) and undergoing lateral expansion ( rhoads 1999 ) , using the treatment presented by panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) and kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) . with the aid of this model , panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 )",
    "have determined the physical parameters of the ten afterglows by modeling their broadband emission .",
    "we employ these ten sets of jet parameters to calculate their emission for any off - axis observer location .",
    "the detection rate as a function of the x - ray / optical / radio search sensitivity is further obtained by integrating over the viewing angle and over the grb rate history in the universe .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows . ",
    "[ section : model ] reviews the model of collimated afterglows used here , and some discussions are presented on the physics of collimated afterglows concerning the detectability of orphan afterglows . ",
    "[ section : formulation ] is for the formulation of orphan afterglow rate calculation .",
    "the results are presented in  [ section : results ] ; they are compared with various past search results and predictions for the current and future facilities are made .",
    "discussions are given in ",
    "[ section : discussion ] , including comparison with previous studies , another possible picture of grb jets , and caveats of our predictions .",
    "our main conclusions are presented in  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the dynamics of a grb jet is calculated by tracking its total energy ( allowing for radiative losses ) and mass . the jet spreads laterally at the sound speed , and it is assumed to be uniform within its aperture ( i.e. the same energy per solid angle in any direction ) and to have sharp boundaries . the afterglow synchrotron emission and the radiative losses are calculated from the strength of the magnetic field in the shocked gas and the power - law distribution of shock - accelerated electrons , taking into account their radiative ( synchrotron and inverse compton ) cooling . to obtain observer light - curves , the jet emission is integrated over its surface , allowing for the differential relativistic beaming and the spread in the photon arrival time across the jet surface .",
    "the afterglow jet model has three parameters that determine the jet dynamics ( the initial jet energy @xmath26 , initial jet half - angle @xmath20 , and external particle density @xmath27 ) , and three parameters pertaining to the microphysics of shocks ( the fraction of the post - shock energy density in magnetic fields @xmath28 , the fractional energy of the least energetic injected electrons @xmath29 , and the power - law index @xmath30 of the shock - accelerated electron energy distribution ) . for hard electron distributions with @xmath31 ,",
    "two other parameters become relevant : the total fraction of the internal energy of the shocked fluid imparted to electrons , which sets a  cut - off \" of the electron distribution at high electron energies , and the larger ( than 2 ) power - law index of the electron index above the cut - off .",
    "the passage of the spectral break associated with the electron distribution cut - off through the optical domain may yield a light - curve break , as suggested by the sharp break seen in 000301c and the steep decay of the optical emission of 991208 .",
    "figures [ fig : lc - x][fig : lc - radio ] show the x - ray , optical , and radio afterglow light curves for the above ten jets , as they would be seen from various viewing angles relative to the center of the jet , @xmath32 .",
    "it can be seen that the behavior of off - axis light curves is very different for different sets of model parameters , even when the opening angle of the jet , @xmath20 , is similar .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : lc - r ] , ` the best case ' , i.e. , the highest rate for orphan afterglow searches is expected for grb 991216 ( @xmath33 ) , whose peak of optical light curves is at @xmath34 ( when it is placed at @xmath35 ) for an observer located with an angle @xmath36 .",
    "if one searches orphan afterglows with a sensitivity better than this , one could find them at more than 100 times higher rate than that expected from spherical grbs ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the other extreme is the cases of grb 980519 or 990123 . even though their jet opening angle @xmath20 is not much different from that of grb 991216 , the peaks of optical light curves are difficult to detect when an observer is located at @xmath38 . in these cases",
    "the relative beaming factor is at most @xmath39 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on the jet initial opening ( and other jet properties ) , as well as the reason for which @xmath22 is maximal for the 991216 afterglow , can be obtained using a simplified model where all the afterglow emission originates from a single point on the jet axis ( dalal et al .",
    "2002 , granot et al . 2002 ) whose dynamics is that of an expanding jet ( rhoads 1999 ) . for narrow ( @xmath40 rad ) , relativistic jets and a homogeneous medium",
    ", it can be shown that the jet lorentz factor @xmath41 is @xmath42 where the subscript `` 0 '' indicates the time ( since the prompt gamma - ray emission ) measured by an on - axis observer ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 being the `` jet - break time '' , i.e@xmath45 the time when @xmath46 and the on - axis observer `` sees '' the entire jet surface and a break in the light curve . taking into account that the photon arrival time for an arbitrary observer location @xmath32 is given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the jet speed in units of the speed of light , equation ( [ gamma ] ) gives the jet lorentz factor as a function of the time @xmath49 when photons arrive at @xmath32 : @xmath50 where @xmath51               \\,\\gamma^2 \\sin^2 ( \\thobs/2 ) \\;.\\ ] ] the above @xmath52 relates the photon arrival time at @xmath32 to that for an on - axis observer : @xmath53 , therefore , in equation ( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath54 .",
    "for an observer located well outside the jet opening ( @xmath55 ) the received jet emission is doppler boosted in frequency by the same factor @xmath56^{-1}$ ] , its intensity being relativistically enhanced by @xmath57 . thus the received afterglow flux",
    "@xmath58 at @xmath32 is related to that seen by an on - axis observer , @xmath59 , through @xmath60 where @xmath61    the observed grb afterglows have power - law optical spectra and light - curves : @xmath62 ( for the above - mentioned ten afterglows , @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 $ ] at @xmath65 , and @xmath66 $ ] at @xmath67 )",

    "for @xmath70 , when @xmath71 , the above equations yield @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the @xmath74 limit , i.e@xmath45 a light - curve with a sharp rise . at @xmath75 and before the time @xmath76 when @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , thus the light - curve continues to rise . at @xmath80",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82 functions asymptotically approach unity , so that the evolution of the jet lorentz factor and the afterglow light - curves become those for an on - axis observer : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",

    "however , if there are enough number of data points to construct a light curve , it may be possible to infer @xmath76 only from orphan afterglows . then , together with an empirical relation between the jet - break time @xmath44 and flux @xmath92 , calibrated with the afterglows which were seen on - axis ( i.e@xmath45 preceded by a grb ) , equations ( [ tpeak ] ) and ( [ fpeak ] ) can be used to determine the relative observer location @xmath93 , @xmath44 , and @xmath92 from the inferred peak time @xmath76 and observed flux @xmath94 of an orphan grb afterglow .    from equation ( [ fpeak ] )",
    "it follows that only jets seen at an angle less than @xmath95^{1/(2\\alpha_2 ) } \\ , \\thjet \\ ; , \\label{eq : theta - max}\\ ] ] can be detected above a given detection threshold @xmath96 .",
    "therefore the relative beaming factor is @xmath97^{1/\\alpha_2}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath22 that can be inferred for each afterglow shown in figure [ fig : lc - r ] , for a given threshold , is consistent with this estimation of @xmath22 . among the set of ten afterglows , 991216 has one of the largest jet - break fluxes @xmath98 (",
    "note that for this afterglow @xmath99 day , the sharper break seen in figure [ fig : lc - r ] at several days being due to the passage through the optical band of a spectral break ) , hardest optical spectra , and shallowest decays after the jet - break time . for these reasons ,",
    "its @xmath22 is the largest in our sample of afterglows , and grb991216 dominates the detection probability of orphan afterglows .",
    "first we calculate the expected number of orphan afterglows per unit solid angle @xmath100 , which can be detected by a snapshot observation with a given sensitivity @xmath96 .",
    "this quantity directly provides the detectability of afterglows in a search where transient objects are found by comparison of several snapshot images taken at time intervals longer than the duration @xmath101 over which the afterglow is brighter than the sensitivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection rate in a survey of consecutive monitoring with a time scale longer than @xmath101 can be estimated by @xmath102 per unit solid angle and observation time .",
    "the afterglow flux at any frequency and observer s time viewed by an observer with arbitrary @xmath32 is calculated with the model presented in the previous section .",
    "from there we can calculate the time duration for an observer , @xmath103 , during which an afterglow is brighter than a given sensitivity , where @xmath8 is redshift and @xmath104 symbolically represents a specific type of grb afterglows .",
    "then , the expected number @xmath105 per all sky can be written as : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the standard comoving volume element in all sky , and @xmath108 is the comoving grb rate density of type @xmath104 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath109 is the true rate of grbs including unobservable ones whose jet are not directed to us .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the detectability of orphan afterglows sensitively depends on afterglow parameters . in order to take this into account and make the most plausible prediction in an empirical way",
    ", we replace the integration over @xmath104 by the sum of the ten well - observed afterglows presented in the previous section .",
    "we assume that all the population of observable grbs is represented by those ten bursts with an equal weight , and it is independent of redshift .",
    "if detection of grbs is flux limited , then a simple sum of the ten observed bursts having very different gamma - ray luminosities might induce some bias from the true population .",
    "however , grbs are generally bright enough to be detected even at very large cosmological distances , and hence the effect of flux limit is expected to be insignificant . in addition , the redshifts of the ten grbs are in a rather small range .",
    "therefore , we expect that the above treatment is not unreasonable . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that we must take into account the estimated opening angle of jets ; the grb rate inferred from the observed number of grbs assuming isotropic emission ( @xmath110 ) is not the true grb rate , but it should be multiplied by the inverse of sky coverage of gamma - ray emission , @xmath111 , to obtain @xmath112 .. ] then , the integration over @xmath104 in equation ( [ eq : nexp1 ] ) should be replaced by the sum of @xmath113 ( = 10 ) grbs , as : @xmath114 it should be noted that the ten grbs chosen by panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) are well observed , with good temporal coverage at various frequencies , and showing a light curve break .",
    "this suggests that there may be a systematic bias toward strongly collimated grbs in our selection .",
    "we note that the ten grb afterglows used here represent about a third of all bursts for which optical afterglows were found .",
    "this indicates that the formulation above overestimates by a factor of up to three the real orphan afterglow rate if the other 2/3 grb afterglows are isotropic and hardly contribute to @xmath115 .",
    "this is probably not much larger than other model uncertainties .",
    "therefore we believe that the ten grbs represent the whole grb population reasonably well .",
    "we assume that @xmath116 traces the cosmic star formation history ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "based on the recent observational estimates ( see , e.g. , totani & takeuchi ( 2002 ) for a summary of recent studies on this issue ) , we assume that @xmath117 at @xmath118 , and @xmath116 is constant at @xmath119 , when the einstein - de sitter universe is adopted .",
    "we set an upper cut - off for redshift as @xmath120 .",
    "the normalization of this rate density is fixed at @xmath121 , as @xmath122 where @xmath123 , based on the fitting to the observed flux distribution ( i.e. , log@xmath124-log@xmath125 relation ) of the batse grbs ( totani 1999 ; schmidt 1999 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath126-dominated universe with ( @xmath127 = ( 0.7 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) and the cosmology - dependence of @xmath116 is corrected appropriately .",
    "figs . [ fig : rate - x][fig : rate - radio ] show the result of calculation for @xmath105 , as a function of sensitivity in x ( 1 kev ) , optical ( @xmath128 ) , and radio ( 5 ghz ) wavebands , respectively .",
    "we also show the rate expected only from on - axis afterglows , i.e. , associated with prompt grbs .",
    "this rate , @xmath129 , is obtained by replacing the range of integration over @xmath130 by @xmath131 in eq ( [ eq : nexp2 ] ) . the relative beaming factor , @xmath132 is shown in the lower panel .",
    "the mean values of redshift and @xmath101 are also shown ; here we calculated average of @xmath133 and @xmath134 because of considerable scatter of these values at a fixed sensitivity .",
    "we also give another mean time , @xmath135 where integration with @xmath136 represents that of eq .",

    "@xmath105 for type ia and ii supernovae calculated by woods & loeb ( 1998 ) for the optical band is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate - r ] .    a clear trend can be seen in all wavebands ; the relative beaming factor @xmath22 is rapidly increasing with the sensitivity limit , while the mean redshift is not .",

    "we also make predictions for the number of orphan afterglows expected in future surveys . the summary of our results is given in table [ table : projects ] .",
    "there are two papers which constrained the orphan afterglow rate in x - ray band : grindlay ( 1999 ) by the _",
    "_ 5 survey with a sensitivity of @xmath143 ( 210kev ) , and greiner et al .",

    "greiner et al . found 23 candidates of afterglows , but they argued that the bulk of these are likely to be nearby flaring stars . if one removes those which are suspected as flaring stars , the remaining candidates are at most @xmath710 .",
    "it is interesting that this number is very close to our expectation .",
    "the advanced satellites such as chandra or xmm - newton have a typical sensitivity limit of @xmath148 for point sources , with a field of view of @xmath149 . at such a sensitivity , the relative beaming factor",
    "is increased to @xmath150 40 .",
    "our model predicts that the probability of finding an orphan afterglow in the field of view of one snapshot observation is @xmath70.02 .",
    "this is apparently small , but accumulation of archive data might be useful to search and constrain orphan afterglows in the future , though discrimination from flaring stars could be a major problem again .",

    "our model predicts that about two orphan afterglows are expected , which is @xmath154 times higher than the case of no beaming .",

    "high redshift supernovae have been intensively searched down to @xmath9 , for the purpose of determination of cosmological parameters ( e.g. , schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the total exposure is about a few tens of `` square degree years '' ( rees 1999 ) .",
    "they are normally searching supernovae with two images separated by one month , which is longer than the characteristic afterglow time scale at this sensitivity ( @xmath155days ) .",
    "therefore , the exposure is equivalent to 12 times searches in a field of a few tens of square degree .",
    "then we estimate the expected detection number is about 1.6 in the past , which is @xmath156 times higher than the case of no beaming .",
    "it should be noted that the past supernova searches ( including that of schaefer ) are not perfectly suitable to orphan afterglow search .",
    "supernovae are found only in one bandpass ( i.e. , no color information ) , and spectroscopic follow - up is done only for a small part of them showing good properties for the cosmological use .",
    "it should also be noted that they sometimes find `` mystery objects '' , which decay faster than supernovae and have no host galaxies ( schmidt et al .",
    "these objects might be orphan afterglows .",
    "recently vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported an interesting , highly luminous transient object which might be an orphan afterglow , found in the initial 1500 deg@xmath4 data of the sloan digital sky survey .",

    "here we give an estimate of expected number of orphan afterglows in the sdss data taken so far .",
    "vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) searched transient objects by the flux difference between imaging observations and later spectroscopic observations .",
    "although the sdss imaging observation has a sensitivity of @xmath157 , spectroscopy is not performed for all objects ; the object was selected as a quasar candidate by its colors . for low redshift quasars whose colors are similar to grb afterglows , the sensitivity is @xmath158 ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) . since @xmath159 for typical grb afterglows",
    ", we can consider that the sensitivity of the search made by vanden berk et al .",
    "is @xmath160 , with a survey area of 1500 deg@xmath4 .",
    "then , we found that the expected number of orphan afterglows to be @xmath161 , which is @xmath162 times higher than the case of no beaming .",
    "this number is small , but not extremely small compared with one detection .",
    "( note , however , that the number becomes smaller by a factor of 10 when we apply the brightness of the sdss transient , @xmath163 , as the search sensitivity . )",
    "our model predicts the mean redshift at this sensitivity to be @xmath164 , and the 1@xmath165 dispersion around this mean is @xmath1660.5 .",
    "therefore the redshift @xmath167 of the host galaxy well falls in the plausible range .",
    "the characteristic time scale predicted by the model , @xmath168 3.5 days with @xmath169 is also consistent with the modest variability shown by the sdss objects during the first two observations separated by 2 days .",
    "therefore , it is not unreasonable even if the sdss transient is an orphan afterglow , although the strong variability of the host galaxy indicates that the transient is much more likely an agn flare .",
    "more statistics is obviously needed for stronger conclusions .    when the sdss project is completed , the covering area in the northern sky",

    "then we expect about 1.3 orphan afterglows , which seems still small to test our model with sufficient statistics by the future data . on the other hand ,",
    "the sdss has another observing mode in the southern sky , observing a 225 deg@xmath4 field repeatedly to achieve a much deeper sensitivity limit than the northern sky ( e.g. , ivezi et al .",
    "these southern data can be used for transient object search with a sensitivity of @xmath9 , which is significantly deeper than the search using spectroscopic data . the southern sky field",
    "is typically observed about four times in a year with a separation longer than one month .",

    "then we expect about 36 orphan afterglows , which is @xmath156 times higher than the case of no beaming .",
    "this number suggests that we may detect a statistically meaningful number of orphan afterglows .",
    "although spectroscopic information will not be immediately available , follow - up observations for host galaxies will give redshift information .",
    "the five - bands photometry data will also help to discriminate the orphan candidates from other transient objects ( rhoads 2001 ) . contamination of highly variable agns , as in the case of the sdss transient of vanden berk et al .",

    "( it should be noted that the host galaxy of the sdss transient reported by vanden berk et al . has a strong radio emission that can not be explained by star formation activity . ) finally , a significant part ( @xmath7 1040% ) of the northern sky will also be observed more than two times , because of overlaps of field - of - views .",
    "the time intervals of these repetitions are not simple but depending on the survey schedule .",
    "these data can also potentially be used for orphan afterglow searches .      the optical gravitational lensing experiment in the third phase ( ogle iii , udalski et al .",

    "the limiting magnitude is about @xmath171 at s / n=10 for a typical exposure of 2 minutes , corresponding @xmath172 for typical afterglow spectrum . using @xmath173days , the total exposure of half a year is equivalent to a snapshot observation of @xmath174 square degree .",
    "then , about 2 or 3 orphan afterglows are expected . since the variability time scale is only a few days at this magnitude , continuous monitoring of ogle iii with the time interval of one or two days is very useful for an afterglow search . the mean redshift is @xmath175 with a dispersion of @xmath176 .",
    "this means that a significant fraction of orphan afterglows detectable by ogle iii should have large redshifts of @xmath177 .",
    "then the brightness of @xmath172 would be much brighter than any kind of supernovae and hence orphan afterglows and supernovae can be discriminated .",
    "the rotse group is considering to use their rotse - iii telescope for an orphan afterglow search , whose field of view is 3.5 deg@xmath4 ( smith et al .",

    "this means that rotse - iii has a capability of doing an orphan afterglow search equivalent to that made by sdss ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2002 ) only in one night .",
    "if such a search is continued for a year , the effective sky coverage could reach @xmath178 deg@xmath4 , taking into account that @xmath179 = 1.3 days at this sensitivity .",
    "then we expect more than 50 orphan afterglows with @xmath180 .",
    "since @xmath181 1 day , more than one observations in a night would also be favored for sufficient time resolution .",
    "the subaru prime focas camera ( suprime - cam ) of the 8.2 m subaru telescope is a unique facility with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath182 , which is more than 100 times wider the than typical field of views of 8m - class telescopes or hst .",
    "therefore this instrument is the most suitable for an orphan afterglow search at the deepest sensitivities we can achieve .",
    "a sensitivity limit of @xmath10 for point sources is achieved by about 10 minutes exposures , and then it is possible to observe about 10 fovs in a night with multi - band photometry .",
    "a clear advantage of the deep sensitivity is that we expect a large relative beaming factor , @xmath183 .",
    "then we expect about 0.4 orphan afterglows .",
    "therefore a detection is not extremely difficult when systematic searches are performed using several nights .",
    "we show the expected number assuming a search over a 5-@xmath184 field in table [ table : projects ] .",
    "if detected , a large value of @xmath22 strongly argues for the existence of many more orphan afterglows than those associated with grbs . at this sensitivity ,",
    "the time scale of afterglow variability is increased to @xmath185 150 days with @xmath186 .",

    "a few supernovae are typically found in one fov of the suprime - cam down to @xmath187 ( m. doi & n. yasuda 2002 , private communications ) . at this magnitude , orphan afterglows may not be sufficiently brighter than supernovae , while the sdss transient of vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) was about 100 times brighter than the brightest supernovae .",
    "most supernovae have thermal spectra that are curved compared with that of power - law grb afterglows .",
    "therefore , color - color plots by multi - band photometry can be used for discrimination ( rhoads 2001 ) , though it is still uncertain whether this method can remove all supernovae including peculiar ones .",
    "offset of optical transients from centers of galaxies , close examination of host galaxies , and past records will be useful to remove agns , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the astrometric satellite gaia will survey all the sky many times with a sensitivity of @xmath172 .",
    "each location of the sky will be observed about 40 times separated by more than one month , during the whole mission ( l. eyer 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore we expect about 720 orphan afterglows . while the relative beaming factor is not large ( @xmath188 at this sensitivity limit ) , the enormous number expected might be useful for statistical analysis of orphan afterglow rate .",
    "because of small @xmath22 , the cross check between gamma - ray observation is crucial to discriminate orphans from ordinary afterglows associated with observable grbs .",
    "it is highly desired that a grb satellite covering a significant part of all sky is working at the time of gaia project .",
    "even more powerful searches than that by the subaru / suprime - cam would become possible at the sensitivity of 8m - class telescopes , by the planned dark matter telescope ( dmt ) , having a 7-deg@xmath4 field of view . in the planned all - sky survey mode ,",

    "the deep probe mode will cover ten 100-deg@xmath4 fields with a sensitivity of 29th magnitude .",
    "then , in principle , a few thousands of orphan afterglows could be detected with @xmath190 , although it is not yet clear how they can be discriminated from other transient objects at such a deep sensitivity level .",
    "it should also be noted that the characteristic time scale @xmath101 is more than 500 days for this sensitivity , and hence a sufficiently long time interval is required for the search .",
    "perna & loeb ( 1998 ) used faint source counts in radio bands to constrain the orphan afterglow rate .",
    "the radio source counts at 8.44ghz is @xmath191 in all sky for @xmath192mjy ( windhorst et al .",
    "1993 ; becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) . following perna & loeb , we assume that about 3% of sources at this sensitivity are variable , yielding an upper bound on the number of orphan afterglows in all sky as @xmath193",
    ". the power index of the radio spectrum is changing from the initial value of @xmath194 ( below the peak frequency ) to @xmath195 ( above the peak frequency ) , but typically it is @xmath196 at a few hundreds days after the burst . taking into account this correction from 8.44 to 5ghz",
    ", we obtain @xmath197 orphans expected by our model .",
    "therefore the current upper bound on variable radio source counts hardly constrains our model .",
    "in fact , the relative beaming factor expected at this sensitivity is @xmath150 15 , which is not greater than the maximum expected by the deepest optical search by subaru / suprime - cam .",
    "one might have thought that radio band is potentially the best waveband for orphan afterglow searches , since radio afterglows are visible long after the bursts and hence we expect a large @xmath198 .",
    "however , in order to achieve @xmath199 100 , the sensitivity must be better than @xmath7 110 @xmath200jy .",
    "the difficulty in radio searches is discrimination from other variable sources such as agns .",
    "it is difficult to do this discrimination only in the radio band , but might be possible if we utilize information in other wavebands .",
    "intensive examination of variable objects found in the radio band with cross - checks between the radio , optical , and x - ray surveys may allow us to find an orphan afterglows in a large ( @xmath7 4050 ) sample of variable agns at sensitivities of @xmath7 0.1mjy .",
    "a unique characteristic of radio afterglow , which is different from x - ray or optical bands , is that @xmath22 does not decrease but stay roughly constant at @xmath20120 when the search sensitivity is decreased to @xmath202 1mjy ( brightest flux region ) .",
    "this is coming from the properties of the radio light curves ; the peak of radio light curves occurs at relatively late time even in the on - axis case .",
    "therefore , the radio afterglows can not be detected at large cosmological distances even when an observer is located on the jet axis , while on - axis early afterglows in x - ray or optical bands are very bright and they can be detected at almost all the cosmological distance scale . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc - radio ] , the peak radio flux is almost independent of @xmath32 in some dominant grbs such as 991216 , 000301c , and 000926 .",
    "therefore @xmath22 converges into a finite value ( @xmath71020 ) with @xmath203 . on the other hand , as mentioned earlier , very bright on - axis afterglows at large cosmological distances are dominant in the brightest flux range in the x - ray or optical bands , making @xmath22 to converge to unity with @xmath203 .",
    "the sharp decrease of the mean redshift @xmath204 of radio afterglow with increasing flux in a flux range of @xmath202 1mjy , where @xmath22 is roughly constant , is also consistent with this interpretation ( see fig [ fig : rate - radio ] ) .",
    "this effect then suggests that a relatively shallower , but wide - field search is an efficient way to constrain the orphan afterglow rate in radio bands , rather than deeper and narrower searches .",
    "in such a survey , low - redshift afterglows with large @xmath101 and @xmath205 should be dominant , which may be called as grb remnants rather than afterglows ( paczyski 2001 ; ayal & piran 2001 ) .",
    "levinson et al . ( 2002 ) made a search of orphan afterglows by comparing the first and nvss surveys .",
    "their sky coverage is 5990 deg@xmath4 , and they found 26 candidates of orphan afterglows , for which they argued that these are unlikely to be radio supernovae , while the possibility of radio - loud agns can not be rejected .",
    "the number in 5990 deg@xmath4 may be increased to @xmath7 65 when corrections for incompleteness are made .",
    "their search sensitivity is 6 mjy at 1.5 ghz , and hence we transformed this into 3.3 mjy at 5 ghz band again assuming @xmath206 .",
    "then we found that our expectation for this search is @xmath207 at @xmath208 .",
    "further observational inspection of these candidates is necessary , and such effort may reveal some orphan afterglows . if , instead , the majority of the candidates turned out to be orphans , it would indicate a very high orphan afterglow rate , which can not be explained within the jet model with sharp edges .    a future project , allen telescope array ( ata ) , for the seti has a sensitivity of about 0.3mjy at 1.4ghz ( 0.16mjy at 5ghz if @xmath206 ) in one minute of integration time , with a pixel size of @xmath71 arcmin diameter and a total beam area of 2.5 degree diameter .",
    "at this integration time , it could cover 25% of the northern sky everyday ( l. blitz 2002 , a private communication , see also http://www.seti-inst.edu/science/ata.html ) . although the sky coverage is not much better than the first / nvss surveys utilized by levinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the better sensitivity increases the expected number of orphan afterglows greatly to @xmath209 , out to the redshift of @xmath210 with a characteristic variability time scale of 200300 days .",
    "furthermore , ata will provide radio light curves sampled everyday , which would be very useful to check whether a transient source is an orphan afterglow or not .",
    "our result that the detection rate of orphan afterglows of collimated grbs in optical bands could be much higher ( @xmath211 at @xmath34 for grb 991216 ) than in the case of spherical grbs seems apparently in contrast to that of dalal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who showed a result that the detection rate of orphan afterglows is insensitive to the jet opening angle @xmath20 , and @xmath22 is constant at @xmath7 34 for a search with a sensitivity of @xmath212 .",
    "we note that the result of dalal et al .",

    "however , if the energy of afterglow jets does not vary much among grbs , as suggested by frail et al ( 2001 ) , despite a wide range of initial jet angles @xmath20 ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) , the flux at the jet - break time @xmath214 measured by an on - axis observer is strongly dependent on @xmath20 , thus , far from the assumption of constancy made by dalal et al ( 2002 ) . within the framework of relativistic jets",
    ", it can be shown that at optical frequencies @xmath215 , where @xmath30 is the index of the power - law electron distribution . furthermore , after the jet - break time the slope @xmath216 of the afterglow decay is @xmath217 ( rhoads 1999 )",
    ". then equation ( [ fpeak ] ) leads to a peak flux @xmath218 for an off - axis observer that is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "this conclusion can also be reached by noting that the jet dynamics after the jet - break time is independent of @xmath20 ( granot et al .",
    "2002 ) . as shown in ",
    "[ section : model ] , for an off - axis observer the afterglow light - curve peaks after the jet - break time , therefore the peak flux , which is determined by the jet dynamics and observer location , does not depend on the initial jet opening . that @xmath218 is independent of @xmath20 implies that @xmath213 does not depend on @xmath20 and the original expectation @xmath219 is restored .",
    "the above result regarding the constancy of @xmath218 is illustrated in in figure [ fig : lc - r - jetangle ] , where we show the light curves of optical afterglows with various values of @xmath20 for an observer located at @xmath220 .",
    "here we used a fixed set of typical afterglow model parameters ( other than @xmath20 ) : @xmath221 erg , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 .",
    "the peak flux hardly changes with @xmath20 at @xmath226 .",
    "figure [ fig : brel - jetangle ] shows the beaming factor @xmath198 as a function of @xmath20 for various sensitivities .",
    "note that @xmath198 becomes larger for more collimated grbs , asymptotically reaching the expected relation @xmath227 when @xmath228 .",
    "thus , orphan afterglow searches could give useful information on the grb collimation .",
    "in this work we have assumed a conical jet with a sharp edge , a uniform energy per solid angle within the jet opening , and no energy outside ( the _ uniform jet model _ ) .",
    "such a model is appropriate if the angular distribution of the energy has a characteristic angular scale and decreases rapidly beyond it , e.g. , an exponential profile @xmath229 . in this model ,",
    "the observed anticorrelation between isotropic equivalent luminosity and jet break time can arise if jets have roughly the same energy but different opening angles @xmath20 among bursts ( frail et al .",
    "however , if the energy per solid angle has a large variation but no characteristic scale ( e.g. a power - law distribution ) a completely different picture is possible .",
    "some recent papers proposed that the observed luminosity ",
    "break - time anticorrelation can be explained by a _",
    "universal jet _ with a non - uniform profile , observed at different viewing angles ( rossi et al .",
    "2002 , salmonson & galama 2002 , zhang & mszros 2002 ) , which can be an alternative to the uniform jet model .",
    "in such a model , the angular distribution of jet energy per unit solid angle should be a power - law @xmath230 to reproduce the above mentioned correlation .",
    "it is not straightforward to predict how the orphan afterglow rate is changed when such a picture is adopted rather than the uniform jet model .",
    "if we have an ideal gamma - ray detector that can detect all grbs everywhere in the universe , then we expect that @xmath22 can not be much greater than unity in the universal jet picture , because of the following reason .",
    "we expect orphan afterglows only when viewing angles larger than an angle @xmath231 corresponding to either the maximum angular spread of the jet or the angle at which small energy per solid angle and/or the lorentz factor yield a barely detectable gamma - ray emission .",
    "the orphan afterglow rate should then be close to that predicted by our model for a jet of opening angle @xmath231 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath231 can be obtained as following .",
    "the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energies calculated by bloom , frail & sari ( 2001 ) for bursts with known redshifts span 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "if the grb output is mainly determined by the jet energy per solid angle toward the observer , then the above distribution @xmath232 implies that the dimmest grb jets are seen at an angle at least 10 times larger than that for the brightest jets .",
    "the latter angle should be around the smallest jet opening angle of @xmath233 found by panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) by modeling the broadband emission of ten afterglows using the uniform jet model , leading to @xmath234 .",
    "since the relative beaming factor decreases with the jet opening angle , as shown in figure [ fig : brel - jetangle ] , we expect that for the universal structured jet model @xmath235 a few for the reasonable search sensitivities of @xmath236 . on the other hand , as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate - r ] , it rapidly increases to @xmath183 with the sensitivity to @xmath10 in the uniform jet model .",
    "however we may have orphan afterglows due to an insufficient gamma - ray sensitivity . since the gamma - ray luminosity per unit solid angle rapidly increases with decreasing @xmath32 in the universal jet model",
    ", the detection of grbs at large distances might be biased toward those with small @xmath32 .",
    "if this is the case , we expect a much higher true grb rate and large @xmath22 might be possible also in the universal jet picture .",
    "a test for this case is to see an anticorrelation between @xmath8 and @xmath32 , and confirm or reject the @xmath32 distribution obeying @xmath237 , as predicted by the universal jet model , for a complete sample of grbs within a redshift range .",
    "the distribution of @xmath205 can be observationally inferred from either luminosity function of grbs with @xmath8 measurements or jet break time obtained by afterglow light - curve fitting . however , the present sample of grbs with known redshifts is too small and we must await future observations .",
    "another test possible by orphan afterglow observation is to examine the early behavior of orphan afterglow light curves . for @xmath238 ,",
    "in the uniform jet model we always expect no afterglow flux at the earliest stage , and the afterglow flux should show gradual increase until the peak flux time , @xmath76 , given in ",
    "[ section : model ] . when @xmath239 , the orphan afterglow events should be dominated by such cases , and hence we expect that the majority of orphan afterglows should show a slow rise at the beginning . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray and optical emission should start immediately after the prompt burst when @xmath240 in the universal jet picture , since there is ejecta moving toward the observer .",
    "the initial slow rise of light curves is possible only when @xmath241 , but such events should be relatively rare because of the large @xmath231 inferred from observations and low absolute luminosity for the large @xmath32 cases .",
    "the detection of such early rise of light curves may not be easy even in the case of the uniform jet model because the rising time scale is still smaller than the overall variability time scale @xmath101 as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : lc - x ] and [ fig : lc - r ] .",
    "if detected , however , it would argue for the uniform jet picture .      here",
    "we describe several caveats of our prediction which should be kept in mind when one compares it to observed data .",
    "it is theoretically conceivable that the grb central engine ejects not only the ultrarelativistic outflow that is responsible for grbs , but also less relativistic matter with comparable total energy .",
    "prompt gamma - ray emission may be very dim or completely absent from such less relativistic components of ejecta , while the afterglow emission similar to those associated with grbs might be possible .",
    "even if the ultrarelativistic component may be strongly collimated to produce beamed grbs , more isotropic , less relativistic component could be associated to most of grbs .",
    "it is also possible that there are much greater number of events of dirty fireball or failed grbs without prompt gamma - ray emission to any direction , than that of observed grbs . the brightest class of core - collapse supernovae , called hypernovae ( iwamoto et al . 2000 ; nakamura et al . 2001 ; mazzali et al . 2002 ) , might also be failed grbs . in either case , the orphan afterglow rate can be increased significantly from our prediction . even if an orphan afterglow is discovered , it is not an easy task to discriminate such another component of ejecta or failed grbs from the pure effect of grb jet collimation ( huang , dai , & lu 2002 ) .",
    "one possible way of discrimination between an orphan afterglow due solely to the viewing geometry from one due to a `` dirty '' fireball is provided by the afterglow decay rate . in the former case ,",
    "the jet collimation should yield a decay slope @xmath242 , while a less collimated component or a failed grb are expected to yield @xmath243 .",
    "the slower rise of the light - curves of off - axis , collimated jets is also useful as discussed in the previous subsection ( see also huang et al .",
    "stronger linear polarization is also expected for off - axis , collimated jets ( sari 1999 ; ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ; granot et al .",
    "finally , the wavelength and sensitivity dependence of @xmath22 might be able to discriminate the above possibilities .",
    "the signature of off - axis afterglows would be the continuous increase of @xmath22 with the search sensitivity , though this trend might be mimicked by failed grbs if their event rate is continuously increasing with decreasing energy output to the dirty component .",
    "the constraint of @xmath244 several by the past x - ray searches already indicates that the event rate of failed grbs producing x - rays can not be much higher than that of successful grbs .",
    "on the other hand , the so - called x - ray rich grbs might be a population between the failed and ordinary grbs ( e.g. , kippen et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we have assumed that the sky coverage of the gamma - ray emission is that corresponding to the jet opening angle obtained from afterglow modeling .",
    "however , this is not necessarily warranted .",
    "the causally connected angular scale during the prompt grb phase is only @xmath245 , which should be much smaller than the jet opening angle @xmath20 ( kumar & piran 2000 ) .",
    "then it is possible that the jet outflow , and thus its gamma - ray emission , is inhomogeneous on an angular scale much smaller than @xmath20 , while the afterglow emission arising later in the jet evolution is more homogeneous . in this case",
    "the grb rate is significantly underestimated , as there could be a number of undetected grbs due to some low - energy patches moving toward the observer , even if the observer is located within the jet opening angle .",
    "we have also assumed that the ten grb afterglows used here are representative for all varieties of grb afterglows .",
    "although x - ray afterglows were observed for the majority of grbs , optical afterglows were found for less than half of grbs .",
    "some afterglows were missed because of late follow - up observations , but there were also unusually dim optical afterglows ( fynbo et al .",
    "2001 ; lazzati , covino & ghisellini 2002 ) .",
    "several explanations can be considered including dust extinction and very large redshift .",
    "recent studies of high redshift galaxies suggest that about half of stars are formed in very dusty galaxies , the fraction being much larger at high redshift than in the local universe ( see , e.g. , totani & takeuchi 2002 ; ramirez - ruiz , trentham , & blain 2002 ) .",
    "the sample of the ten afterglows used here is clearly biased toward afterglows occurring in less dusty galaxies .",
    "then our estimate of optical orphan afterglow rate may be overestimated by a factor of about two .",
    "when a grb occurs in a molecular cloud or high density region with significant amount of dust , the dust along the direction of the jet might be destroyed by strong optical - uv flash ( waxman & draine 2000 ) or early x - ray radiation ( fruchter , krolik , & rhoads 2001 ) , making optical afterglows visible for on - axis observers . however , this effect should be small for off - axis observers , because the off - axis x - ray afterglow flux is much weaker when the light - curve peaks . this phenomenon may effectively reduce the observed relative beaming factor @xmath22 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the prediction for radio orphan afterglows is not affected by dust extinction .",
    "we presented a quantitative prediction for the detection rate of orphan grb afterglows , based on one of the latest afterglow models that has been tested with a number of observed afterglows .",
    "we found that the orphan afterglow rate sensitively depends on afterglow model parameters , and a fairly large @xmath198 ( @xmath246100 ) is possible for some types of grbs , by an optical search with reasonable depth ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "we derived our best - guess prediction of orphan afterglow rate , by taking a weighted mean of the ten sets of afterglow parameters that fit to ten well - observed afterglows .",
    "although there are a number of effects or caveats which could significantly change our predictions , the prediction will be useful as `` a baseline model '' when we interpret the results of past and future surveys for extragalactic transient objects .",
    "our prediction is consistent with all the past surveys in x - rays , optical , and radio wavebands .",
    "greiner et al . ( 2000 ) reported that there are about 10 possible candidates of orphan afterglows , which is interestingly very close to our expectation .",
    "although the sdss transient reported by vanden berk et al . ( 2002 ) is very likely to be a radio - loud agn , their search has already reached a meaningful sensitivity , since our expectation is about 0.2 afterglows for this search . a recent search by levinson et al .",
