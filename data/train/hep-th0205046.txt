    "@xmath2    the self - gravitating t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole @xcite in a curved spacetime has been studied a few years ago considering it as a magnetic point charge @xcite .",
    "the exact solution obtained for the metric tensor has the reissner - nordstrm form corresponding to a point ( magnetic ) charge @xmath3 .",
    "a regular solution for this system has been presented by nieuwenhuizen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "there , they have constructed a positive - definite functional energy function of the matter fields only .",
    "they claimed that this is enough to prove the existence of non - singular monopole solutions .",
    "more recently lee _",
    "et al _ @xcite and ortiz @xcite have shown that non - singular monopole solutions exist only if the higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath0 , is smaller or equal to a critical value , @xmath4 , which is of order of the planck mass . in the limiting case the monopole becomes a black hole , with the region outside the horizon described by the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "barriola and vilenkin @xcite have analyzed the effect in the geometry of the spacetime produced by a system composed by higgs field only , which undergoes to a spontaneous breakdown of global @xmath5 gauge symmetry .",
    "they noticed that the solution for the metric tensor is similar to the schwarzchild spacetime with an additional solid angle deficit and a nonzero scalar curvature .",
    "they pointed out that for large value of the geometric mass , the model describes a black hole carrying a global monopole .",
    "one of the main differences between the large distance behaviors in the geometries of the spacetime produced by both topological defects , the local and the global monopoles , is due to their energy densities , which for the global monopole case decreases as @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is responsible for the solid angle deficit presented by this geometry .    in this paper",
    "we continue the discussion related with this topic and consider both type of topological defects in the same model .",
    "we analyze the effects produced by local and global monopole on the geometry of the manifold .",
    "we investigate the possibility of this system to present regular solution and we also analyze its behavior near and far away from the defect s core .",
    "so the basic idea of this model is to describe a regular topological defect which presents a magnetic field besides to present a solid angle deficit .    assuming the existence of such object in a typical galaxy , the total energy contained inside it would be strongly provided by the global higgs field @xcite .",
    ", consequently the total newtonian mass inside a space region of radial extent @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "considering @xmath7 the typical radius of a galaxy @xmath9 and for the symmetry breaking scale @xmath10 which is the value for grand unified theories , this total energy due to the global monopole is approximately ten times the mass of the galaxy . ]",
    "astrophysics bounds on the flux of magnetic monopole and evidence that the galactic magnetic field is mainly azimuthal @xcite indicate that the excess number density of such object , if they really exist , is very small .",
    "moreover , upper bounds on the number density of global monopole is at most one in the local group of galaxies as pointed out by hiscock @xcite .    differently from a pure global monopole ,",
    "this compost topological defect exerts a gravitational interaction on surrounding matter , apart from the electromagnetic one on charged particles .",
    "so , such object shares with both , global and magnetic monopole , some of their relevant properties . numerical simulation related with the upper bound on the number density of them in the universe , may be developed in a similar manner as it was developed to global monopole only in the paper by bennett and rhie @xcite .",
    "the complete information about this system requires the knowledge of the behaviors of the matter and gravitational fields , i.e. , we have to know how these fields change along the distance and how they are connected ; besides we also want to know how these fields behaviors are affected when the energy scale of breakdown of gauge symmetry and the higgs self - coupling are varying . because it is impossible to solve analytically the complete set of coupled differential equation associated with this system , only numerical analysis makes possible to obtain these informations .",
    "numerical analysis of self - gravitating magnetic monopole has been developed by several authors , see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite . for the global monopole case harari and loust @xcite",
    "have shown numerically the behavior of the higgs field and how it is affected by the variation of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "more recently maison @xcite and liebling @xcite have analyzed the stability condition for the global monopole solution .",
    "they found that for @xmath0 bigger than some critical value , the global monopole fail to be static .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath11 we briefly review some of the relevant characteristics of the local and global monopole in a curved spacetime .",
    "we also introduce the model used to describe the system which presents the topological defect formed by both monopoles and derive the equations of motion which governs the behavior of this object . because it is impossible to solve analytically this set of differential equations we leave for the section @xmath12 its numerical analysis . from our results it is possible to exhibit the behaviors for matter and gravitational fields , their dependence with the distance from the point to the monopole s core and how they are connected among other pertinent informations . in section",
    "@xmath13 we present our conclusions and some important remarks about this paper .",
    "in this section we introduce the model which , by a spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry , gives rise to a non - abelian magnetic and global monopoles in a curved spacetime .",
    "this defect presents both properties of its constituent : a magnetic field and a solid angle deficit .",
    "below we shall briefly review both topological defects separately .",
    "the global monopole is a defect obtained by a system composed by a self - coupling higgs isotriplet field which undergoes to a spontaneous breakdown of global @xmath5 gauge symmetry to @xmath14 .",
    "coupling this matter field with the einstein equation , a spherically symmetric metric tensor given by the line element @xmath15 presents regular solutions for the radial functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , that for points far from the monopole s core are given by @xcite @xmath18 @xmath0 being the scale energy where the symmetry is broken .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is approximately the mass of the monopole . neglecting the mass term and rescaling the time variable",
    ", we can rewrite the monopole metric tensor as @xmath20 where the parameter @xmath21 is smaller than unity .",
    "the above geometry presents no newtonian potential , it is not flat . ] and the solid angle of a sphere of unity radius is @xmath22 , so smaller than @xmath23 .    the energy - momentum tensor associated with the matter field , outside the monopole s core can be approximately written by @xmath24 consequently the energy is linearly divergent at large distance : @xmath25 .",
    "the magnetic monopole is also a topological defect described by a system composed by a self - coupling higgs isotriplet field which interacts with a yang - mills gauge field .",
    "this system presents a local @xmath26 gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken down to @xmath14 . in a flat spacetime",
    "this theory gives rise to t hooft - polyakov monopole with magnetic charge and finite energy @xcite .",
    "this system has been firstly analyzed in a curved spacetime in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors have shown that this system presents as an exact solution a metric tensor identical with the reissner - nordstrm one @xmath27 where @xmath19 ia a constant of integration , identified as the mass of the monopole and @xmath28 is its magnetic charge .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated with the matter fields compatible with this singular solution is @xmath29    in their remarkable paper nieuwenhuizen _",
    "et al _ @xcite have proved the existence of non - singular self - gravitating magnetic monopole . in order to do that ,",
    "they have constructed a positive - definite functional energy whose minimum value was claimed to be attained by a stable non - singular solution .",
    "they also have presented the boundary conditions obeyed by regular solutions at the monopole s core and show that the asymptotic form of the metric tensor is a reissner - nordstrm geometry .",
    "more recently lee _",
    "et al _ @xcite and ortiz @xcite have analyzed again the self - gravitating magnetic monopole system and observed that for very heavy monopole there is no non - singular solutions .",
    "they pointed out that when @xmath30 becomes large @xmath31 presents a local minimum which approaches to zero ; so for some critical value there appears a horizon and the monopole becomes a black - hole with the region outside to the horizon described by the reissner - nordstrm metric spacetime .",
    "they present numerical solutions for the matter and gravitational fields for different values of the parameter @xmath32 , where explicitly the horizon shows up .",
    "after this brief review let us introduce the model proposed by us .",
    "the basic idea of this model is to describe both topological defects on the same time . in order to do",
    "that we endow this model with a gauge group product of two different gauge groups symmetry . because we want to obtain magnetic monopole configuration we have to gauge one of them .",
    "also we introduce two higgs fields in @xmath33 and @xmath34 representations of the @xmath35 groups , where the subindices refer to local @xmath36 and global @xmath37 gauge symmetries .",
    "the higgs fields are responsible for the spontaneous break of gauge symmetries @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "moreover in order to simplify our analysis we shall consider two situations : the first case is obtained taking the higgs self - coupling constants and vacuum expectation values the same in both sectors and do not admit a direct coupling between them .",
    "the second case is a particular situation of the first one taking the self - coupling associated with the local sector vanishing . in the latter , the system also presents localized self - gravitating magnetic monopole . the lagrangian density which governs the more general case , i.e. , the first one",
    ", is : @xmath40 with the latin indices referring to the internal gauge groups @xmath41 .",
    "we also have @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44    in the following analysis we shall consider only static spherically symmetric solutions , for this reason the metric tensor is written in the form presented by ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the ansatz adopted to describe both topological defects is the usual one in flat spacetime written in terms of cartesian coordinates as @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48    because we are seeking static solutions all properties of the system may be described by the lagrangian which is the sum of the einstein one , @xmath49 , and the covariant matter lagrangian , @xmath50 : @xmath51 and @xmath52    substituting the configurations ( [ higgs1 ] ) - ( [ a0 ] ) into ( [ l ] ) , together with the spherically symmetric metric tensor ( [ s ] ) , we obtain for the matter field the following lagrangian : @xmath53 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 where the primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath56 .",

    "as we can see ( [ le ] ) can be written in terms of two new radial fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the gravitational degrees of freedom can be obtained by : @xmath62 and @xmath63    integrating ( [ x ] ) assuming that at infinity @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 \\ .\\ ] ]    now going back to ( [ y ] ) we obtain @xmath66 \\ .\\ ] ]    integrating the above equation assuming the regularity condition on @xmath67 at origin , we have @xmath68 being @xmath21 and @xmath69 given by the integral @xmath70 + \\frac{(u')^2}{ae^2{r^{'}}^2}+\\frac{\\eta^2u^2h^2}{{r^{'}}^2}+\\eta^2\\frac{(f^2 - 1)}{{r^{'}}^2 } \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\frac{(u^2 - 1)^2}{2e^2{r^{'}}^4}+\\frac{\\lambda\\eta^4}4(h^2 - 1)^2+\\frac{\\lambda\\eta^4}4(f^2 - 1)^2 \\right ] \\",

    "however the gravitational field interacts with both sectors .",
    "moreover these equations are invariant under the discrete symmetries @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the first two transformations correspond to specific choice of monopoles configurations and the last one corresponds to a gauge transformation .    in order to analyze this set of differential equations",
    "let us first discuss the boundary conditions obeyed by the fields .",
    "the boundary condition on the matter fields at infinity follows by the requirement of the topological defect be localized @xmath88    due to the presence of the global higgs sector , the metric components do not asymptote to unity .",
    "so according to the results exhibited for the purely global monopole spacetime we can write the following boundary conditions at infinity : @xmath89    the last two conditions above follows from the previous one obeyed by the matter fields , as can be easily observed by the expressions ( [ k ] ) and ( [ u ] ) .",
    "the double sign which appear for the behavior of @xmath90 and @xmath91 at infinity corresponds to the monopole or anti - monopole configurations . in this paper",
    "we shall adopt the positive sign for both higgs fields .",
    "the boundary conditions at origin required by regularity of our solutions are : @xmath92    being satisfied these conditions , the behavior of the integrand for the lagrangian associated with the matter and gravitational fields , eqs .",
    "( [ lm ] ) and ( [ le ] ) , vanish at origin .    as it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the differential equations obeyed by the matter fields associated with the local monopole sector only , admit exact ( singular ) solution @xmath93 and @xmath94 everywhere .",
    "however as to the global monopole sector , the field @xmath91 goes to unity only at infinity .",
    "so , unfortunately the complete set of differential equations does not admit closed solution , even singular one .",
    "so the relevant aspects about this compost defect can only be observed numerically .",
    "we leave this analysis for the next section . before to end the present section we would like to make two comments about this model : + @xmath95 the first one refers to the positive - definite functional energy property enjoyed by this model .",
    "in fact , eliminating the gravitational degrees of freedom from the total lagrangian , @xmath96 , by using ( [ x ] ) , we obtain a energy - functional , @xmath97 , expressed in terms of the matter fields as : @xmath98 @xmath99",
    "the second point that we want to mention is that a pointlike topological defect which takes into account a ( point ) magnetic charge @xmath3 in a solid angle deficit geometry , can be obtained by considering a non - dynamical energy - momentum tensor below in the einstein equation : @xmath100 the gravitational field associated with the above tensor reads : @xmath101 which corresponds to the reissner - nordstrm spacetime with an additional solid angle deficit factor .",
    "this metric tensor , as mentioned above , describes the effect produced in the geometry by two distinct objects : the global monopole , responsible for a solid angle deficit , and the magnetic monopoles , responsible for a non - vanishing radial magnetic field @xmath102    although the above expressions represent exact solutions for this system , unfortunately they can not be accepted as physical solution .",
    "the non - integrable factor @xmath103 of @xmath104 provides an infinity energy inside a finite space region around the defect .",
    "finally we want to say that the scalar curvature associated with the above spacetime is @xmath105 .",
    "in this section we shall exhibit the most relevant aspects about this compost defect under a numerical analysis .",
    "our strategy is to present numerical solutions for the matter and gravitational fields which obey regularity conditions at origin .",
    "( [ o ] ) .",
    "mainly we are interested to analyse their behaviors as the parameters @xmath0 , associated with the energy scale where the symmetry is spontaneously broken and @xmath1 , the self - coupling constant , both vary . in order to start the numerical analysis",
    "we shall express the set of differential equations , ( [ ab ] ) - ( [ f ] ) , in terms of two dimensionless parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 , rescaling the radial coordinate @xmath56 as @xmath108 .",
    "the case @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 corresponds to the flat - space one .",
    "the solutions for the matter fields is the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole for the local sector with the global sector independent .",
    "choosing @xmath111 the solution for the @xmath112 and @xmath90 can be given in a closed form @xcite .",
    "as to the global sector , vanishing @xmath113 the system does not provide localized solution : the differential equation for @xmath91 becomes linear and a regular solution at origin diverges as @xmath114 .",
    "an intermediate situation happens when we assume @xmath115 and the self - coupling constant for the local higgs sector only vanishes . in this case",
    "the matter field equation becomes @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 where the primes in the above equations denote differentiation with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "as we have said before , in this section we shall analyse , numerically , both cases : the first one described by eqs .",
    "( [ ab ] ) - ( [ f ] ) , and the second one by eqs .",
    "( [ ab1 ] ) - ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "now let us start first with the complete model .",

    "there is only one constant to be adjusted .",
    "the set of differential equations presents only one parameter @xmath138 .",
    "this model has been first numerically analyzed by harari and loust @xcite .",
    "there , they show that the behavior of the higgs field is quite insensitive to the values of @xmath138 in the interval @xmath139 .",
    "more recently , maison and liebling @xcite and liebling @xcite returned to the numerical analysis of this model and found that for @xmath140 , @xmath141 decreases toward zero indicating the presence of a horizon .",
    "a more complicated case is when @xmath142 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 different from zero .",
    "this case corresponds to a gravitating magnetic monopole .",
    "there are two constants to be adjusted numerically in order the system to present localized topological defect .",

    "in these papers the authors observed that the system presents singular solutions when @xmath138 is greater than some critical value , @xmath143 . for these situations @xmath141 has zeros , the schwarzchild radius becomes greater than the monopole s size , so the monopole must be a black - hole .    now returning to our system , we present in what follows our numerical results . defining by the radius of the global and magnetic monopoles core the value of the dimensionless variable @xmath119 corresponding to @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively",

    "the magnetic monopole s core is firstly formed .",
    "moreover , other graphs not included in this paper indicate that the shapes of @xmath149 and @xmath150 are almost insensitive to the values of the parameter @xmath138 .    the figs . @xmath151 and @xmath152 display the behavior of the function @xmath153 with @xmath119 for different values of @xmath113 and @xmath138 . from them",
