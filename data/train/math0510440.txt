    "classical current algebras ( also called loop algebras ) and their central extensions , the affine lie algebras , are of fundamental importance in quite a number of fields in mathematics and its applications .",
    "these algebras are examples of infinite dimensional lie algebras which are still tractable .",
    "they constitute the subclass of kac - moody algebras of untwisted affine type .    if one rewrites the original purely algebraic definition in geometric terms the classical current algebras correspond to lie algebra valued meromorphic functions on the riemann sphere ( i.e.  on the unique compact riemann surface of genus zero ) which are allowed to have poles only at two fixed points .",
    "if this rewriting is done , a very useful generalization ( e.g.  needed in string theory ) is to consider the objects over a compact riemann surface of arbitrary genus with more than two points where poles are allowed .",
    "the main problem is to introduce a replacement of the grading in the classical case , which is necessary to construct highest weight and fock space representations .",
    "this is obtained by an almost - graded structure ( see section  [ s : hg ] ) , a weaker structure but still strong enough to do the job .",
    "furthermore , to obtain representations of certain types one is forced to pass over to central extensions .    such objects ( vector fields , functions , etc . ) and",
    "central extensions for higher genus with two possible poles were introduced by krichever and novikov @xcite and generalized by me to the multi - point situation @xcite .",
    "these objects are of importance in a global operator approach to conformal field theory @xcite,@xcite . more generally , the current algebra resp . their central extensions , the affine algebras , correspond to symmetries of infinite dimensional systems .",
    "their @xmath1-deformed version ( i.e.  the quantum affine algebras ) are in close connection with difference equation and with special functions .",
    "there is a very interesting direct relation to difference equation .",
    "krichever and novikov constructed higher genus analogues of baker ",
    "akhiezer difference functions which are eigen functions of suitable difference equations . starting from these functions , representations of higher genus affine algebras associated to the lie algebra @xmath2 are obtained .",
    "these are related to the two - dimensional toda lattice @xcite .    in this write - up of the talk",
    "i report on uniqueness and classification results for higher genus multi - point affine lie algebras which i recently obtained .",
    "in particular , it turns out that for the current algebra associated to a finite - dimensional simple lie algebra ( e.g. for @xmath3 ) there exists up to equivalence and rescaling a unique non - trivial central extension which extends the almost - grading of the current algebra .",
    "the proofs can be found in @xcite .",
    "there also further references , historical remarks and corresponding results for the lie algebras of lie algebra valued meromorphic differential operators can be found .",
    "the results depend also on a complete classification of central extensions of scalar functions , vector fields and differential operators of krichever  novikov type obtained in @xcite .",

    "clearly , @xmath7 is an infinite dimensional lie algebra .",
    "these algebras are candidates for symmetry algebras of systems with infinitely many independent symmetries .",
    "unfortunately , in the process of constructing representations of certain types ( e.g. highest weight representations ) one is forced to `` regularize '' certain natural actions . as a result",
    "one obtains only so called _ projective representations _ , which in turn define honest representations of certain central extensions of @xmath7 .    what is a central extension @xmath17 of a lie algebra @xmath18 ? as vector space we take @xmath19 .",
    "we set @xmath20 and @xmath21 and consider the following product @xmath22:= \\widehat{[a , b]}+\\psi(a , b)\\,t,\\quad [ \\hat a , t]=0,\\ ] ] with @xmath23 a bilinear map . now @xmath17 is a lie algebra if and only if @xmath24 is a lie algebra two - cocycle of @xmath18 ( with values in the trivial module @xmath25 ) .",

    "the algebras are exactly the kac - moody algebras of untwisted affine type @xcite .",
    "before we can extend the construction to higher genus we have to geometrize the classical situation . recall that the associative algebra of laurent polynomials @xmath8}$ ] can equivalently be described as the algebra consisting of those meromorphic functions on the riemann sphere ( resp . the complex projective line @xmath44 ) which are holomorphic outside @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath14 the quasi - global coordinate ) .",
    "the current algebra @xmath7 can be interpreted as lie algebra of @xmath4valued meromorphic functions on the riemann sphere with possible poles only at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the riemann sphere is the unique compact riemann surface of genus zero . from this point of view",
    "the next step is to take @xmath47 any compact riemann surface of arbitrary genus @xmath48 and an arbitrary finite set @xmath49 of points where poles of the meromorphic objects will be allowed . in this way",
    "we obtain the higher genus ( multi - point ) current algebra as the algebra of @xmath4valued functions on @xmath47 with only possibly poles at @xmath49 .",
    "we need gradings , central extensions etc .    for this goal we split @xmath49 into two non - empty disjoint subsets @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",

    "as long as @xmath69 and @xmath70 can not to be chosen to be 0 the algebra is not honestly graded .",
    "it is only _ almost - graded_. in a similar way one introduces almost - gradedness for lie algebras .",
    "this notion was introduced by krichever and novikov @xcite ( they called it quasi - graded ) and they constructed such an almost - grading in the higher genus and two point case . to find an almost - grading in the multi - point case is more difficult .",
    "this weaker grading is enough to introduce and study highest weight representations . as a remark",
    "aside : with a special choice of basis one has @xmath71 and the @xmath70 depends in a known manner on the genus @xmath48 and the number of points in @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite .    the higher genus multi - point current algebra @xmath7 is the tensor product @xmath72 with the lie product @xmath73=[x , y]\\otimes ( f\\cdot g)\\ ] ] and almost - grading @xmath74",

    "hence , it defines a central extension @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , there exist central extensions for @xmath7 .",
    "but contrary to the classical situation , even if @xmath4 is a simple lie algebra , there will not be a unique nontrivial cocycle class . if we choose essentially different contours @xmath75 the @xmath78 define essentially different central extensions @xmath77 .",
    "but in the classical situation we were able to extend our grading of @xmath7 to @xmath43 by assigning a degree to the central element @xmath79 .",
    "this will not necessarily be true for all cocycles of the form ( [ e : cocycal ] ) .",
    "a 2-cocycle is called _ local _ if there exist @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82    given a local cocycle @xmath24 defining a central extension , then by setting @xmath83 ( or any other number ) the almost - grading of @xmath7 extends to the central extension .",
    "vice versa , if such an extension of the almost - grading exists , the defining cocycle will be local .",
    "we use @xmath84 to denote the subspace of 2-cocycle classes containing a representative which is local . in general , the cocycles @xmath85 are not local .",
    "but if we choose as integration contour a smooth contour @xmath86 separating the points in @xmath50 from the points in @xmath51 and which is of winding number 1 , then it can be shown that @xmath87 is a local cocycle .",

    "we obtain that every local cocycle is cohomologous to a geometric cocycle of the form ( [ e : csc ] ) .",
    "the cocycles coming from fock space representations and other type of representations are local .",
    "hence we obtain that there exists a unique equivalence class ( up to rescaling of the central element ) of central extensions coming from these representations .",
    "in @xcite the more general situation of reductive lie algebras is considered .",
    "recall that a finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath4 is reductive if and only if it is the direct sum ( as lie algebra ) @xmath92    if the abelian summand @xmath93 is missing then @xmath4 is semi - simple . in the semi - simple case it is shown that every local 2-cocycle is cohomologous to a cocycle of the type ( [ e : csc ] ) where @xmath91 is an arbitrary linear combination of the individual cartan  killing forms of the summands ( trivially extended to the rest ) .",
    "vice versa , such cocycles are local . in particular , we get @xmath94    in the reductive case we have to add another condition .",
    "we denote by @xmath95 the lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields on @xmath47 which are holomorphic outside of @xmath49 .",
    "a 2-cocycle is called @xmath95-invariant if @xmath96 cocycles of the form ( [ e : cocycal ] ) are @xmath95-invariant . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that every @xmath95-invariant local cocycle is cohomologous to ( [ e : csc ] ) .",
    "in particular @xmath97 . here the index @xmath95 denotes the classes containing cocycles as representatives which are @xmath95-invariant , and @xmath98 . in the semi - simple case",
    "there is no need to pose explicitly @xmath95-invariance as in this case in every local cocycle class there is a unique @xmath95-invariant representative .",
    "again , the condition of @xmath95-invariance is automatic if the representations under consideration are representations coming from the larger algebra of lie algebra valued differential operators .",
    "the lie algebra of trace - less matrices @xmath3 is simple .",
    "hence , the unique non - trivial almost - graded central extension is given ( up to equivalence and rescaling ) by the cocycle @xmath99    the lie algebra of all matrices @xmath100 is the direct sum @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the abelian summand of scalar matrices .",
    "in particular @xmath100 is a reductive lie algebra . following the general results @xmath103 . a basis is given by the elements @xmath29 ( [ e : slcoc ] ) and @xmath104",
