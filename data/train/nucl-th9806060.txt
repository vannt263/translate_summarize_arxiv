    "similar expressions hold for negative parity resonances , e.g. the @xmath43 resonance : @xmath44    obviously the `` left '' and `` right '' pseudovector couplings differ by complex phases which are determined by the resonance width . _",
    "these phases are relevant to interference terms , which are important for calculating threshold meson production processes at high momentum transfers , in which different resonances are excited by one collision of e.g.  protons and nuclei ( @xmath45corre - lations)_. one process , which is very sensitive to interference terms , is the proton induced @xmath46-production at threshold . as this process is dominated by the excitation of just one resonance ( @xmath43 ) , the phases discussed in the model above can only be measured , if the resonance is excited by a nonlocal interaction and deexcited by a local interaction ( and _ vice versa _ ) , or if the selfenergy of the resonance is treated to be not constant , but energy - dependent .",
    "a remarkable feature of the full effective field theoretic model is that unitarity is guaranteed , although the coupling constants can have arbitrary _ complex _ values , which are related to the self - energies of the resonances .",
    "this property should be not too surprising , as from renormalization theory it is well known , that not only the mass has to be renormalized , but also the coupling constants .",
    "a special feature of resonance effective degrees of freedom is , that not only the self energies are complex , but also the couplings .",
    "it is not clear , whether a bosonization procedure applied to an elementary non abelian theory like qcd will lead only to effective degrees of freedom , which have real self energies like the nucleon .",
    "_ the presented model shows , that resonant degrees of freedom are also compatible with the requirement of unitarity_.    finally one should mention a very subtle point for discussion , which has to be solved consistently within such an effective , non local field theoretical model : as the interaction between nucleons and mesons can generate resonances as poles of the s - matrix in the complex energy plane , one has to make clear  _ to avoid double counting _  , in what way the effective resonant degrees of freedom in the model above have to be interpreted .",
