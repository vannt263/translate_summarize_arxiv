    "a large amount of theoretical work has been done for antiproton ( @xmath2 ) collisions with he atoms stimulated by discrepancies between experiment and theory lasting for more than a decade  @xcite . in the case of hydrogen also a number of contributions exist for atomic targets whereas the knowledge on low - energy @xmath2  collisions with the simplest two - electron molecule h@xmath3  is rather poor @xcite , especially , concerning theory @xcite .",
    "precise data on @xmath2  + h@xmath3  are , however , of great interest in many fields .",
    "they can , e.g. , be used to determine the stopping power which is a prerequisite for the design of low - energy @xmath2  storage rings taking the interactions with residual - gas atoms and molecules into account .",
    "but also for the preparation of accurate future experiments with low - energy @xmath2 , which in turn can be used as a test of competing theoretical approaches , the maximum of the stopping power is of importance",
    ". a short overview on the present status of @xmath2+h@xmath3  shall be given .",
    "the used method has already been discussed in some detail elsewhere @xcite as well as partly in the article on interactions of antiprotons with alkali - metal atoms @xcite .",
    "a time - dependent close - coupling approach is employed which uses the impact - parameter method .",
    "the target molecule is treated as an effective one - electron system by applying a model potential @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the collision process is expanded in a one - center approach in eigenfunctions of the one - electron model hamiltonian of the target .",
    "thereby , the radial part is expanded in b - spline functions and the angular part in a symmetry - adapted sum of spherical harmonics .",
    "[ [ ionization ] ] ionization + + + + + + + + + +    in fig .  1 the present h@xmath3  results for ionization and electron loss by @xmath2  and @xmath4 impact ,",
    "respectively , are compared with cross sections given in the literature and results for _ atomic _ hydrogen multiplied by two .",
    "it can be seen that the naive picture of the h@xmath3  molecule as being practically the same as two independent h atoms only holds at high impact energies @xmath1 . for high and intermediate impact energies",
    "the present @xmath2  results agree with the experiments by anderson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and hvelplund _ et al . _",
    "@xcite although they are slightly lower than the measured data . at low energies",
    "@xmath5kev , however , the experimental results are significantly smaller than the present calculations which partly can be explained with experimental problems not accounted for at that time @xcite .",
    "these problems also occurred for @xmath2  + he cross sections measured with the same apparatus @xcite and were identified by very recent he measurement  @xcite .",
    "the other theoretical curve  @xcite describes the @xmath2  + h@xmath3  cross section only for @xmath6kev satisfyingly . for smaller @xmath1",
    ", however , it follows rather the curve for twice the hydrogen atom .",
    "this behavior may originate from an insufficient description of the continuum ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for high energies the present cross sections for @xmath4 and @xmath2  are practically the same as can be expected in the validity regime of the first born approximation which is independent of the sign of the projectile charge . for these energies",
    "the experimental results for @xmath2  are , however , larger than those for @xmath4 by rudd _",
    "et al_. this may originate from different normalization procedures . on the other hand , the present @xmath4 results agree with the experimental data in the whole energy range considered here ; confirming the applicability of the used method even for @xmath4 collisions .",
    "[ [ excitation ] ] excitation + + + + + + + + + +    the results for excitation are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "a comparison of _ molecular _ with _ atomic _ hydrogen shows clearly that the simplified picture of h@xmath3  behaving basically like two h atoms is not senseful in the present context .",
    "remarkably , the excitation cross section for _ one _ h atom is practically the same as for h@xmath3 .",
    "it can also be seen that transitions into p ( @xmath7 ) states ( of the model potential ) are by far the most prominent excitations . in particular , the differential cross section for the first excited 2p state is of the order of 2/3 of the total excitation cross section . in the case of h@xmath3",
    "excitation by @xmath2  neither experimental nor other theoretical results exist in the literature to the authors knowledge .",
    "therefore , the present results for the excitation into the 2p state are compared in fig .  2 with experimental electron - collision results by liu _ et al .",
    "@xcite for excitations from the h@xmath3  ground state x into the energetically - lowest dipole - allowed states labeled with b and c which are orientationally averaged @xcite .",
    "the present results for @xmath2  impact agree nicely with the experiment as expected at high energies . however , experimental excitation data for @xmath2  impact would be valuable in order to judge the quality of the results at energies below the maximum at @xmath8 kev .",
    "[ [ electron - energy - spectra ] ] electron - energy spectra + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in fig .  3 electron - energy spectra for @xmath2  and @xmath4 collisions with h@xmath3",
    "are presented for @xmath9 kev .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath2  and @xmath4 calculations reveals different slopes for both curves",
    ". the most striking difference , however , is the peak in the case of @xmath4 impact at an electron energy @xmath10 which corresponds to the velocity of the proton whereas the @xmath2  curve is lowered around this @xmath10 . a comparison of the @xmath4 curve with measured data by gealy",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite yields good agreement except for the mentioned peak .",
    "the area under the maximum ( hatched ) and therefore the difference between the present and the experimental curve corresponds to the cross section for electron capture which is excluded in the experimental data .",
    "[ [ stopping - power ] ] stopping power + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    using the differential information on ionization and excitation discussed so far it is possible to determine the electronic energy - loss cross section also referred to as stopping power @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "4 the present results for @xmath2  + h@xmath3   are compared with experimental data by lodi rizzini _",
    "et al . _",
    "also , data for negative muon ( @xmath12 ) impact is given measured by hauser _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "except for deviations at small velocities due to the mass dependence of the nuclear stopping power the results for @xmath2  and @xmath12 should be the same .",
    "the obvious discrepancies ( @xmath13 ) between @xmath2  and @xmath12 indicate the experimental difficulties .",
    "the present results are for @xmath6 kev in good agreement with the @xmath12 data .",
    "the ionization cross sections @xcite used as input for the analysis in @xcite were , however , found to be erroneous for @xmath14 kev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the present curve for @xmath15 kev is remarkably similar to that of the experimental @xmath2curve but for @xmath16 kev .",
    "this means that there seems to be a scaling of @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath171.6 between the present and the experimental @xmath2  data .",
    "the stopping power for @xmath2  + h@xmath3  is currently investigated in detail in order to clarify this issue .",
    "the present results obtained with a model potential are meaningful for ionization , excitation , and even for differential excitation and electron spectra for energies above the maximum around 60 kev .",
    "this opens up the possibility to further analyze the data in order to obtain doubly - differential cross sections . but",
    "also as has been done here to extract quantities like the stopping power for @xmath2  + h@xmath3collisions .    the differences for ionization between experiment and theory at low @xmath2energies as well as between experiments for @xmath2  and @xmath4 impact at high energies and the lack of measurements of excitation obviously show the need for new experimental @xmath2+h@xmath3  data which may be available in the near future @xcite . however , also an improvement of the theoretical description is necessary to account for the expected increase of importance of molecular ( e.g. , charge asymmetry , dissociation ) and two - electron effects for low - energy impacts @xmath18 kev which are already indicated by the present findings . additionally , the present stopping power results for @xmath15 kev agree with the experimental data for @xmath12 but disagree for @xmath2  making further investigation of @xmath19 necessary",
