    "mesonic lagrangians are often used to describe the decays and the spectral functions of resonances listed in the pdg @xcite .",
    "such lagrangians make use of some symmetries of the underlying qcd ( such as flavor or chiral symmetry ) , e.g. chiral perturbation theory @xcite and ( extended ) sigma models @xcite . in particular , in the case of some enigmatic resonances , such as the light @xmath2 meson addressed in this work , the role of mesonic loops turns out to be extremely important , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein .",
    "yet , mesons are not elementary particles but are extended objects with a radius of about @xmath4 fm .",
    "some type of form factor is needed . already in the @xmath5 model , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , a form factor reducing the decay for increasing phase space is present .",
    "this form factor is also useful when calculating quantum fluctuations ( loops ) , since all contributions become finite ( see sec .",
    "it is possible to include a form factor directly in the lagrangian by using nonlocal interaction terms , e.g. refs .",
    "in many studies of mesons , a 3d form factor is employed for simplicity .",
    "this is usually regarded as a breaking of covariance . here",
    "we discuss how to introduce nonlocal terms which deliver the desired 3d cutoff ( sec . 3 ) .",
    "interestingly , an extension which preserves covariance is possible @xcite .",
    "implications for the scalar kaonic sector and conclusions are discussed in sec .",
    "in general , effective lagrangians contain both derivative and nonderivative interaction terms @xcite .",
    "a prototype of such a lagrangian in which a ( scalar ) state @xmath6 interacts with two ( pseudoscalar ) particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 reads : @xmath9 the scalar kaonic sector is obtained upon identifying @xmath10 ( in first approximation corresponding to @xmath1 ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( other isospin combinations are here neglected ) .",
    "the tree - level decay width @xmath13 as function of the ` running ' mass @xmath14 of @xmath6 reads:@xmath15   ^{2}\\text { , } % \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mass of @xmath7 and @xmath17 the mass of @xmath8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is the modulus of the three - momentum of ( one of the ) outgoing particle(s):@xmath19 the actual value of the tree - level decay width is obtained by setting @xmath14 to the tree - level ( nominal ) mass @xmath20 of the field @xmath6 , @xmath21 the lagrangian ( [ laglocal ] ) as it stands is not suitable for loop calculations .",
    "one can regularize the theory by considering an ` ad hoc ' modification of both vertices via a form factor:@xmath22 the quantity @xmath23 is often called ` cutoff ' ( a smooth cutoff here ) .",
    "the choice of a gaussian is part of the modelling and is obviously not unique .",
    "anyway , there is clear physical motivation behind @xmath23 : it is the energy scale which takes into account that mesons are extended objects .",
    "the dimension of the system is roughly given by @xmath24 numerically @xmath23 lies between @xmath4 and @xmath25 gev @xcite .",
    "the ` local ' limit is recovered for @xmath26 as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ abmod ] ) , the decay width changes as @xmath27 and is similar to the form factor implemented in the @xmath5 model ( see e.g. @xcite and the ` quark model ' review in  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of the loop @xmath28 in which the particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 circulate as calculated from the original local lagrangian ( [ laglocal ] ) reads@xmath29   ^{2}}{\\left [   k_{1}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}% + i\\varepsilon\\right ]   \\left [   k_{2}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}+i\\varepsilon\\right ]   } \\text { , } % \\ ] ] where the constraint @xmath30 is understood and @xmath31 is the momentum of the unstable particle @xmath32 in its reference frame @xmath33 as mentioned above , this loop contribution is divergent ( with @xmath34 ) .",
    "the substitution ( [ abmod ] ) makes it convergent thanks to the form - factor:@xmath35   ^{2}f_{\\lambda } ^{2}(\\vec{k}_{1}^{2})}{\\left [   k_{1}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}+i\\varepsilon\\right ] \\left [   k_{2}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}+i\\varepsilon\\right ]   } \\text { . }",
    "\\label{looplambda}%\\ ] ] at this point , one may object that the form factor breaks covariance , since it depends on the three - momentum only .",
    "we will show in the next section that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "once the form factor is introduced , the full propagator of the particle @xmath6 is calculated as @xmath36 ^{-1}$ ] where @xmath37 is the bare mass of @xmath6 and @xmath38 at the one - loop level , the breit - wigner mass of @xmath6 is defined as @xmath39 while the pole mass is obtained by solving the equation @xmath40 in the complex @xmath41-plane , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for the scalar @xmath42 and @xmath43 sectors .",
    "the real part of the loop can be also obtained as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an additional constant due to a subtlety of qft containing derivatives , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . for @xmath46 , @xmath47 scale as @xmath48 then a three - time subtracted dispersion relation would be needed .",
    "this is quite cumbersome and reinforces the viewpoint that -for the particular case of hadronic physics- a physical cutoff is a meaningful procedure .",
    "the modification of eq . ( [ abmod ] ) and , consequently , the form factor in eqs . ( [ gammalambda ] ) and ( [ looplambda ] )",
    "have been introduced as an ` ad hoc ' change of the feynman rules .",
    "yet , it is possible to modify the lagrangian in order that the modified equations automatically follows from it .    * nonlocal extension 1 * : the easiest way ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) is to consider the following nonlocal lagrangian ( for simplicity we discuss here only the @xmath49-term in eq .",
    "( [ laglocal ] ) , but the @xmath50-term is very similar):@xmath51 the feynman rule at the @xmath49-vertex is modified ( upon defining @xmath52 @xmath53 , hence : @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 for @xmath56 one reobtains the local limit .",
    "a covariant form factor requires a dependence @xmath57 , hence @xmath58 follows . quite interestingly , if the masses of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal and on - shell , @xmath59 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ gammalambda ] ) upon setting @xmath60 . however , the loop is different from  eq .",
    "( [ looplambda ] ) , since it involve @xmath61 into the integral [ and not simply @xmath62 . a generalization in case of unequal masses",
    "is discussed in  refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the choice @xmath63 leads to the desired result @xmath64 of eq .",
    "( [ abmod ] ) and also of eqs .",
    "( [ gammalambda ] ) and ( [ looplambda ] ) , but it explicitly breaks covariance .",
    "this result is anyway valuable since it shows that it is possible to get the desired 3d cutoff form , but should be used only in the reference frame of the decaying particle .",
    "* nonlocal extension 2 * : we aim to determine the lagrangian which generates the vertex function ( [ abmod ] ) in a covariant manner @xcite .",
    "we start from the general nonlocal expression:@xmath65 where the vertex - function @xmath66 in position space has been introduced .",
    "the case @xmath66 @xmath67 delivers the local limit ( [ laglocal ] ) .",
    "the vertex function in momentum space is given by:@xmath68 here we _ assume _ that @xmath66 is such that @xmath69 it respects covariance because the final form factor is a function of lorentz - products .",
    "nevertheless , in the rest frame of @xmath6 one recovers the desired dependence : @xmath70 note , in order to get the desired expression , @xmath71 out of which @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 this line of reasoning shows that it is -at least in principle- possible to reconcile covariance with a 3d form factor in the rest frame of the decaying particle .",
    "in this work we have discussed form factors entering in mesonic interaction terms .",
    "we have started from a local lagrangian and we have modified the interaction vertex ` ad hoc ' by introducing a function of the three - momentum of one outgoing particle .",
    "then , we have presented two nonlocal extensions of the lagrangian that deliver the desired expressions without the need of modifying by hand the feynman rules .",
    "the first nonlocal extension is relatively simple but delivers the desired form factor at the price of breaking covariance .",
    "the second extension is more involved but delivers a 3d cutoff in the rest frame of the decaying particle by respecting covariance .",
    "recently , the expressions of the propagator described in sec . 2 ( which are then justified by our study of  sec .",
    "3 ) were used to study the positions of the poles in the complex plane in both the isodoublet- and isovector - scalar sectors . in both cases ,",
    "the lagrangians contains only one seed state , corresponding to the quark - antiquark resonances @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . yet , the loops ( with the necessary presence of a form factor ) are strong enough to generate two additional resonances : @xmath77 and @xmath78 these are companion poles , and hence dynamically generated states .",
    "moreover , these states disappear in the large-@xmath3 limit , confirming their non - conventional nature . in particular , @xmath2 is not yet confirmed in the pdg @xcite .",
    "the study based on the formalism described in these proceedings unequivocally finds a pole : @xmath79 gev @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with other works , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein , and reinforces the need of accepting this state in the pdg .    in both refs .",
    "@xcite one obtains a similar values of the cutoff : @xmath80 gev .",
    "moreover , in  ref .",
    "@xcite different form factors have been tested .",
    "it is found that they can not fit the pion - kaon scattering data so well as the gaussian form factor .",
    "thus , even if there is in principle no fundamental reason behind a gaussian function , it nevertheless seems to be the best choice in order to describe hadronic phenomenology .",
