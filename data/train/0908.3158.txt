    "observations of galaxy clusters have provided important clues about cosmology , structure formation and the evolution of galaxies . as the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe , clusters are unique locations to study the creation and evolution of agn .",
    "based upon the observed correlation between supermassive black hole mass and galaxy bulge mass @xcite , we expect that there should be numerous , luminous agn in the bright ellipticals in rich clusters which can affect their surroundings .",
    "indeed , observational evidence supports the notion that non - gravitational processes have affected the entropy of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , as suggested by the steepness of the l@xmath6-t@xmath6 relationship compared to self - similar scaling expectations @xcite .",
    "radio - loud agn have been directly implicated in cluster icm heating because evacuated `` bubbles '' in the diffuse x - ray emitting gas have been observed that are spatially coincident with non - thermal radio emission @xcite . however , up until now only agn in the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have been observed to spawn these bubbles and so only the central agn has been incorporated into icm heating models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case ,",
    "theoretical difficulties arise when attempting to distribute this heating throughout the central cluster regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a natural solution would be to have other cluster agn injecting energy throughout the inner cluster region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "most cluster agn studies have either employed clusters in a flux - limited survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or simply selected clusters based upon availability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but since flux - limited surveys produce cluster samples which contain more luminous and thus more massive objects at higher redshifts , this selection naturally identifies more evolved structures at earlier times .",
    "this is clearly opposite to the type of selection one would prefer to use to study cluster , galaxy or agn evolution .",
    "moreover , this mismatch can result in comparisons that can obscure any true evolution , since more massive clusters are placed at the beginning of the evolutionary sequence and less massive objects at the end .    in this paper",
    ", we choose galaxy clusters by using a new selection method that avoids the difficulty just described . in this summary of first results",
    ", we use this sample to investigate the nature of radio galaxies and x - ray point sources ( xpss ) in clusters at moderate-@xmath7 ( 0.20.4 ) . for now , we avoid using the term x - ray agn until the agn nature of the xpss is proven ( or disproven ) by our observations presented below .",
    "previous studies simply assumed that these x - ray emitters are agn ( e.g. , the `` optically - dull x - ray agn '' ; @xcite ) . the agn nature of these xpss has not been carefully scrutinized before and their x - ray and radio properties could have a significant impact on models for agn heating in clusters .",
    "we address each of these points in detail in this paper .",
    "we describe our sample selection in   [ sec : sample ] and data analysis of x - ray and radio selected agn in ",

    "guided by hydrodynamical simulations to track the growth of massive cluster halos ( @xmath11 ) from @xmath12 to the present epoch , we have used the temperature of the icm as a proxy for cluster mass .",
    "we selected @xmath2 clusters that are predicted to evolve into objects like the present - day coma cluster ( kt=8.2@xmath130.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the cosmological simulations ( similar to @xcite ) which include preheating of the icm @xcite will be fully described in @xcite . in short , measurements of @xmath14(z)/t@xmath15(z=0 ) for individual massive cluster halos in the simulation are normalized by the coma cluster s present temperature to illustrate the variance of cluster properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : road_to_coma ] displays the median temperature of these simulated coma cluster progenitors as a function of redshift ( solid line ) and the 25th and 75th percentiles about this distribution ( dashed lines ) . at z@xmath160.3 , the icm temperature of a coma cluster progenitor is predicted to be 7.0@xmath132.6 kev .",
    "the temperature spread is due partly to the modest number of realizations of coma cluster mass - scale objects in these simulations . at z@xmath161.0 ,",
    "the permitted temperature range for our sample slowly decreases to 4.0@xmath132.0 kev .",
    "our unique method attempts to select clusters of similar mass at a given redshift and thus these clusters on the `` road to coma '' will be used for consistent evolutionary comparisons later .",
    "we selected clusters readily available in the _ chandra _ archives with adequate exposure time to detect x - ray sources with @xmath17 ergs  s@xmath18 .",

    "we re - processed the _ chandra _ archival observations using ciao v3.3 and caldb v2.2 . following the typical acis data preparation pipeline ,",

    "the newest calibration files for charge transfer inefficiency and time - dependent gain were applied , and then finally the event files were filtered on status and grade .",
    "flaring events were identified by extracting the 0.3 - 12 kev count rate on either the acis - s1 or acis - i1 chips and we eliminated time periods with rates @xmath33@xmath24 above the observed mean .",
    "cluster icm spectra were extracted from within a 1 mpc projected radius after obvious point sources were removed ( point source identification is described below ) . if a background area could not be extracted on the same chip as the cluster emission , we extracted background spectra from re - projected blank sky observations .",
    "obvious cool - core regions were excised prior to spectral modeling .",
    "source spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 cts / bin , then modeled using _ xspec _",
    "@xcite and mekal models with foreground extinction held fixed at the galactic hydrogen column at the cluster coordinates and a constant 0.3 solar metal abundance .",
    "the lower redshift limit of our cluster sample is limited by the size of one acis chip , allowing a @xmath25  1 mpc radius to fall on one chip .",
    "a 1 mpc radius corresponds to @xmath25  0.5 r@xmath26 .",
    "however , our simulated cluster temperatures were extracted from within r@xmath26 . based on the similarity in the temperature profiles of many clusters for r@xmath30.1 r@xmath26 , in both cool - core and non - cool cores , we expect the icm temperature profile to be decreasing beyond 0.5 r@xmath26 .",
    "thus , our temperature estimates extracted within a 1 mpc projected radius will slightly overestimate the full cluster temperature by @xmath25  1020% relative to those derived in the simulations to select coma - like clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , the t@xmath6 values listed in column 6 of table  [ tab : data_obs ] need to be decreased by 1020% to be accurately compared to the simulated coma cluster progenitor temperatures mentioned in the previous section .",
    "xpss were identified using the ciao tool _ wavdetect _ with a threshold limit set to @xmath27 which corresponds to one false source detection per @xmath28 pixels ( roughly the number of pixels in an unbinned image of one acis chip ) .",
    "each potential source above this threshold was scrutinized individually .",
    "broadband ( 0.3 - 8.0 kev ) counts were extracted within a 95% encircled energy radius estimated for a monochromatic energy source of 1.5 kev at the observed off - axis angle .",
    "background annuli regions were 2.0 times the extraction radius .",
    "this background subtraction does not account for the slow change of t@xmath6 with radius within a cluster .",
    "however , a more sophisticated background subtraction using annuli at the xps cluster radius show resulting differences less than the quoted photon statistics    conversion from net counts to flux was estimated for the xpss using xspec assuming a power - law spectrum with photon index of @xmath29=1.7 ( n@xmath30 ) . to estimate the x - ray flux limit for each observation ( column 7 of table  [ tab : data_obs ] ) , we estimated the point source flux for a 3@xmath24 detection above the background noise near the survey edge ( r @xmath16 1 mpc ) .",
    "abell 2111 has a formal 3@xmath24 detection limit of @xmath31 ergs  s@xmath18 , slightly greater than our stated survey threshold of @xmath32 ergs  s@xmath18 .",
    "however , we feel comfortable leaving this cluster in our sample because the ciao _ wavdetect _ routine identified a point source with @xmath33 ergs  s@xmath18 if the source is located at the cluster redshift .",
    "poissonian errors were calculated using the @xcite approximation .",
    "x - ray sources with snr@xmath33 and with expected k - corrected , rest - frame @xmath34 ergs  s@xmath18 are catalogued as potential cluster agn candidates .",
    "we note that standard detection methods described above may miss xpss associated with the bcg due to misidentifying agn emission as unresolved `` cool core '' icm emission ; i.e. , the cusp of the icm emission can mask the presence of an agn .",

    "the k - s probability is noticeably larger for just the cluster xpss ( k - s d - statistic = 0.26 and probability = 1.9@xmath2210@xmath67 ) , but this comparison is still significant at the 99.8% confidence level . to account for the likely presence of xpss in bcgs which are not detected due to the presence of an icm `` cool core '' cusp in the diffuse x - ray emission , we add two xpss at r=0 . the k - s probability for this augmented xps distribution ( k - s d - statistic = 0.38 and probability = 7.1@xmath2210@xmath68 ) is comparable to the original x - ray @xmath37 radio population and only strengthens our conclusion of a centrally concentrated population of xpss .    within 500 kpc 16 radio galaxies in our sample make up 6@xmath132% of the bright ( l@xmath69  265 crs galaxies ( 40% of 665 ) , while the 4 xpss ( excluding abell 963 x1 ) make up 2@xmath131% .",

    "we identify abell 963 x1 as a clear agn .    but due to low photon counts in the other 7 xpss , we instead compute x - ray colors to estimate their spectral slope and amount of intrinsic absorption .",

    "in addition to the analysis above , a composite x - ray spectrum in five discrete rest - frame bands is consistent with a power - law model with @xmath81 with no evidence for intrinsic absorption .",
    "thus , if these xpss are agn , they are _ unobscured _ agn .",
    "there is no evidence for x - ray spectral differences for xpss with and without radio detections , and , although the statistics are modest , this evidence also weighs in favor of all of these xpss being agn of some sort .",

    "there are only 3 xpss which are radio - detected , suggesting two populations .",
    "are we really seeing two populations of sources or is this just a function of our flux limits ? to investigate this further , we determined the x - ray to radio luminosity ratios for our cluster sources ( figure  [ fig : lum_ratio ] ) and compared them to optical elliptical `` core '' galaxies in , more luminous 3c / fr 1 radio galaxies in @xcite and seyferts hosted by early - type galaxies in .",
    "a loose linear relationship exists in figure  [ fig : lum_ratio ] for the low ( optical `` core '' galaxies ) and higher power ( fr 1s ) ellipticals of the and @xcite samples , respectively .",
    "the x - ray limits on the radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with other fr 1s ; i.e. , we would require perhaps a factor of @xmath25  3 improvement in x - ray sensitivity before we would expect to detect all of these radio galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the xpss in our sample would be easily detected in the radio _ if _ they were similar to fr 1 radio galaxies ; indeed , they should have been detected at power levels comparable to or significantly higher than the radio galaxy detections we did make .",
    "so , we can rule out that the radio galaxies and the xpss are drawn from the same parent population . but the xpss do have x - ray luminosities and radio luminosity limits that place them among the seyferts in figure  [ fig : lum_ratio ] .",

    "while they possess x - ray luminosities of seyferts , they do not possess the emission - line spectra of seyferts nor is there unambiguous evidence for obscuration .",

    "we have also gone through the exercise of determining if the seyfert spectrum ( i.e. , blue power - law and luminous emission lines of @xmath84 $ ] and h@xmath40 ) of abell 963 x1 would be detectable if scaled down by the difference in x - ray luminosity between this sources and the others ( using standard scaling relations observed for x - ray emitting seyferts ) .",
    "we find that a seyfert - like agn of power 10% of abell 963 x1 would be detected easily in our optical spectra and a 3% power - level probably would be detected as well .",
    "but it might be possible to `` hide '' a seyfert 2 type spectrum ( line luminosities can be an order of magnitude lower than many seyfert 1s ) , which leads to the suggestion that these could be highly - obscured agn .",
    "however , as we showed above , there is no strong evidence for obscuration in these xpss based on their x - ray spectra . nor are their optical broad - band colors significantly redder than the crs although a low luminosity agn with m@xmath85 could be hidden in these luminous galaxies without affecting the broad - band colors within our photometric errors .",

    "confirmation of this hypothesis can be obtained by detecting optical polarization in the b - band ( blueward of ca ii h&k at this redshift in abell 963 x2 ) .",

    "additionally , simulations of cool cores in in - falling cluster ellipticals are 12 orders of magnitude less than the x - ray emission in these xpss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while the x - ray spectra of the xpss we have found can be fit by thermal models with t@xmath6 less than the surrounding medium , a power - law fit is better in all individual cases and composites ( see   [ subsec : xray_properties ] ) .",
    "the typical observational signature for soft thermal coronae is the presence of the iron l - shell bump at 0.8 - 1 kev , resulting in a poor power law fit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the one possibility for which we can imagine creating cool cores as luminous as @xmath11210@xmath62 ergs s@xmath18 is a remnant core of a group bcg that is in the process of falling into the cluster . but",
    "none of the xpss we detect ( except one cluster bcg which also has radio emission ) is in a very bright crs galaxy .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that these sources are remnant cool cores and that the best model for xpss is hbl - type bl lac objects .",
    "based upon the observed properties of the 20 radio galaxies and the 7 xpss ( total of 24 agn counting overlaps and excluding abell 963 x1 ) in these 11 low-@xmath7 clusters , we conclude that all these sources are radio - loud agn .",
    "the radio galaxies have properties consistent with high luminosity fr  1 sources while the xpss without radio emission are most consistent with being low power fr  1s with x - ray emission that has been doppler - boosted above our detection threshold .",

    "since flattening of this function is expected at or below 10@xmath94 ergs s@xmath18 @xcite , the number of predicted hbls would be somewhat less than 100% and so in good agreement with the extrapolation of the rlf .",
    "thus , the two extrapolations roughly agree in predicting that almost all bright crs galaxies ( @xmath112 l@xmath113 ) at projected radial distance @xmath45  500 kpc contain radio - loud and x - ray loud agn at l@xmath117w hz@xmath18 and l@xmath118 , respectively ( see fig .  [",

    "this agreement is additional evidence that our identification of the xpss as low luminosity bl lacs is correct .",
    "this result suggests that deeper x - ray surveys of nearby clusters will discover large numbers of xpss in bright ellipticals and very deep _ chandra _ imaging of the perseus cluster appears to show just that @xcite .",
    "what impact do all of these agn have on cluster heating models ?",
    "they certainly can provide a distributed source of heat which moves about the inner 0.5 mpc or more of these clusters on a characteristic crossing time of a few @xmath22 10@xmath119 yrs .",
    "but is their input miniscule compared with the agn in the bcg ? to evaluate the heating by these agn we have assumed results from two recent studies of the relationship between radio luminosity and jet power by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "first we assume that the magnetic field strength in the inner regions of these clusters is relatively constant so that the icm heating rate is proportional only to the agn radio luminosity ( i.e. , a constant efficiency factor for heating the icm ; @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption allows us to use the observed rlf to predict that all cluster agn below l@xmath120 3 @xmath22 10@xmath23 w hz@xmath18 account for @xmath12110% of cluster heating ; whereas the brightest two or three sources ( including the bcg ) contribute @xmath11290% of the total heating in proportion to their observed radio fluxes .",
    "however , a recent re - evaluation of the relationship between jet power and radio luminosity has been undertaken by @xcite who find evidence that the magnetic field strength is not constant for these sources so that a shallower scaling is required : p@xmath122 @xmath123 l@xmath124 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in these calculations appears to be due to source aging ; the correlation for the youngest sources is at the steep end of the range @xcite .",
    "therefore , statistical results obtained from the rlf is more robust than a `` snapshot '' of a single cluster s agn population at any given time .",
    "for example , while our modest - sized sample provides a mean radio galaxy census of @xmath25  2 per cluster at l@xmath21 3 @xmath22 10@xmath23 w hz@xmath18 , the spread in relative radio luminosities and thus icm heating in these clusters is large .",
    "for example , 5 of these clusters have their total radio luminosity dominated by a bcg radio galaxy , 5 do not and one has no radio galaxy above our flux limit at all . nevertheless , if the @xcite scaling is correct , weaker radio galaxies are proportionally more important than previously believed in heating the icm . if p@xmath122 @xmath123 l@xmath5 , sources weaker than 3 @xmath22 10@xmath23 w hz@xmath18 account for more than half ( @xmath25  55% ) of the heating and so must be taken into account in the modeling .",
    "this spatially - distributed ( and moving ! ) heat input does however solve the problem of heat distribution throughout the icm .    from the perspective of agn heating models , the radio galaxy data in table  [ tab : radio_galaxies ]",
    "take on a new importance .",
    "approximately half of these clusters have luminous radio sources in their bcgs ( the radio galaxy ms1008-r3 is in a galaxy @xmath25  1 mag fainter than the bcg despite being somewhat close to the icm emission centroid ) and one cluster ( abell 2111 ) has no luminous radio galaxies at all . if the agn heating model for clusters is correct , we might expect quite a wide variation in temperature profiles and/or temperature variations at different radii for clusters with and without luminous bcg radio sources .",
    "it is also possible that peculiar motions of these heat sources within clusters may smooth - out these differences .",
    "what is clear from the radio luminosities in table  [ tab : radio_galaxies ] is that the luminous radio sources in non - bcgs can not be ignored in cluster heating models .",
    "we have presented a summary of first results from a large survey of x - ray and radio - selected agn in clusters of galaxies . in the 11 clusters we chose as potential progenitors to the present - day coma cluster , we find 20 radio galaxies and 8 x - ray point sources ( xpss ) with 75% of these agn centrally concentrated within 500 kpc projected radius .",
    "this central concentration of the agn is significantly different ( @xmath3 99.999% significance level ) from the radial distribution of the bright ( @xmath3l@xmath113 ) cluster red sequence ( crs ) galaxies .",
    "this extreme central concentration strongly suggests that an agn triggering mechanism similar to the bondi accretion model of @xcite is operating in these clusters .",
    "however , since most of these agn are moving supersonically with respect to the cluster icm , hoyle - littleton accretion must be operable , making any gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole extremely inefficient .",
    "therefore , other models for triggering and powering these radio - loud agn should be considered ( e.g. , extracting black hole spin ; @xcite ) .    except for 3 x - ray /",
    "radio sources , cluster radio galaxies and xpss generally are not coincident within our observed luminosity limits of l@xmath125  and l@xmath126 , respectively . while radio galaxies are certainly associated with agn activity , we questioned prima facie whether cluster xpss in crs ellipticals are truly agn . these x - ray sources show no strong evidence for obscuration and are hosted by luminous red galaxies with no evidence for typical seyfert - like emission signatures .",
    "but non - agn models for cluster xpss ( e.g. , `` cool core '' emission in luminous galaxy nuclei ) seem quite implausible , with these xpss being 12 orders of magnitude brighter than expected in simulations and as observed in very nearby clusters like virgo @xcite .",
    "these xpss are not spatially resolved in the _ chandra _ images and have x - ray spectra which individually or in composite are better fit as power - law sources , not thermal sources .",
    "we conclude that the most viable model for the xpss is that they are the beamed x - ray emission from low - luminosity bl lac objects , similar to the high - energy - peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) studied in detail by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "hbls are found in luminous , passive ellipticals , have steep x - ray spectra with no evidence for internal absorption , optical spectra which in many cases are indistinguishable from normal giant ellipticals and are found in rich groups and moderately rich clusters at similar redshifts to those observed here ( see @xcite for a review of their properties ) .",
    "the presence of excess blue light ( blueward of the ca  ii break ) when compared to crs elliptical galaxies in one xps ( abell 963 x2 ) supports the hbl classification of these sources ; a @xmath127-band polarization detection in this object would solidify this assertion .",
    "one other xpss with a smaller amount of excess blue light also is present in our sample .",
    "x - ray sources with similar properties have been termed x - ray emitting , passive elliptical galaxies or `` optically - dull agn '' in other contexts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so we suggest based on our current observations that these sources are low luminosity hbls as well .",
    "more accurate colors and calibrated spectra can be used to test this hypothesis by searching for the excess blue light we have found in at least one of our sample members .",
    "therefore , both the xpss and the radio sources are most readily identified as radio - loud agn with jets which can transfer heat into the surrounding icm .",
    "extrapolations of the radio galaxy population in these clusters using the observed rlf of agn and the xps population using the observed xlf of hbls @xcite converge to predict that 85 - 100% of all bright ellipticals within projected radii of 500 kpc from rich cluster centers will be detected by deep radio maps ( l@xmath128 @xmath112 10@xmath116 w hz@xmath18 ) and x - ray imaging ( detection limits of l@xmath129 10@xmath98 ergs s@xmath18 ) .",
    "there is already a hint that this prediction is correct in that @xcite have found that all bright ellipticals in the very core of the perseus cluster have xpss ( l@xmath130 ) based on a very deep x - ray image of the core of that cluster .",
    "these results have an impact on models for icm heating .",
    "based upon the rlf for agn and the jet power vs. radio luminosity scaling law of @xcite , we expect that the few brightest radio galaxies ( including the radio source associated with the bcg ) contribute @xmath11290% of the heating while the remainder at l@xmath128 @xmath121 3@xmath2210@xmath23 w hz@xmath18 contribute @xmath12110% .",
    "but if the more recent scaling between jet power and radio luminosity advocated by @xcite is correct , the lower power sources ( below our x - ray and radio detection limits ) contribute @xmath11255% of the heat input . due to their relative motion , the non - bcg agn heat the icm more uniformly and",
    "would not be expected to possess obvious x - ray `` bubbles '' in the icm associated with their jets due to their peculiar velocities .",
    "it seems likely that these ideas can be used to test whether agn are responsible for heating the cluster icm as has been proposed @xcite .",
    "putting together two of our results , ( 1 ) radio galaxies are more centrally - concentrated than crs galaxies as a whole and ( 2 ) large numbers of low power radio galaxies are responsible for most of the icm heating , suggests that a feedback mechanism by which the density of the icm triggers the heat sources to offset cooling may be operable in rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "we might also expect that those clusters whose total radio luminosities are dominated by radio sources in the bcg might possess a different temperature profile or detailed temperature / density signatures than clusters dominated by non - bcg radio galaxies .",
    "the existence of these signatures and what these signatures might be will be addressed in a future publication @xcite .",

    "<S> the most viable model for these sources are low luminosity bl lac objects , similar to the high - energy - peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) discovered in abundance in serendipitous x - ray surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the expected numbers of lower luminosity fr 1 radio galaxies and hbls in our sample converge to suggest that very deep radio and x - ray images of rich clusters will detect agn ( either x - ray or radio emitting or both ) in a large fraction of bright elliptical galaxies in the inner 500 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> because both the radio galaxies and the xpss possess relativistic jets , they ( and , by extension , the entire rlf ) can inject heat into the icm . using the most recent scalings of p@xmath4 l@xmath5 from @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , radio sources weaker than our luminosity limit probably contribute the majority of the heat to the icm . also , </S>",
    "<S> because these heat sources move around the cluster , agn heating is distributed rather evenly . </S>",
    "<S> if a majority of icm heating is due to large numbers of low power radio sources , triggered into activity by the increasing icm density as they move inward , this may be the feedback mechanism necessary to stabilize cooling in cluster cores . </S>"
