    "seeking statistical arbitrages in financial markets is the most important task to academics and practitioners in finance .",
    "chances for systematic arbitrages are not only counter - examples to the efficient market hypothesis proposed by @xcite and @xcite but also sources of profitable trading strategies to the practitioners . among various market inefficiencies ,",
    "price momentum ( @xcite ) is a well - known market anomaly that is not explained by the fama - french three - factor model ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the price momentum has been found in many asset classes and markets ( @xcite ) , it is still inexplicable with numerous alternative explanations on the phenomena , such as autocorrelation and cross - sectional correlation ( @xcite ) , sector momentum ( @xcite ) , investors behavioral aspects to news dissemination ( @xcite ) , symmetry breaking of arbitrage ( @xcite ) and transaction cost ( @xcite ) .    introducing various ranking rules to momentum - style portfolio construction is a worthwhile approach for understanding the price momentum .",
    "first of all , it is a direct way of searching for potential factors which can explain the momentum phenomena .",
    "additionally , alternative criteria can be used as potential indicators for trading signals in practice .",
    "several selection rules have been proposed and the literature covers time series model ( @xcite ) , trading volume ( @xcite , liquidity ( @xcite ) , analogy from momentum in physics ( @xcite ) , reward - risk measures ( @xcite ) and 52-week high price ( @xcite ) .    in particular ,",
    "the 52-week high momentum strategy ( @xcite ) is well - matched to the philosophy of the price momentum . since the 52-week high price is the highest price during recent 52 weeks , higher returns to the highest price in the last one year underline the existence of stronger price momentum during the period .",
    "recording the new 52-week high price is also regarded as a signal that assets have capabilities of upward price movement in future . in the similar way ,",
    "consideration on the 52-week low price is also possible .",
    "however , the opposite direction is not a successful ranking criterion for the momentum strategy .    testing the 52-week low price as a selection rule is not the only approach for incorporating downside risks into the process of momentum - style portfolio construction .",
    "@xcite paid attention to reward - risk measures , such as sharpe ratio , starr and r - ratio .",
    "it was reported that the tail behavior can predict future price directions of equities in the s&p 500 universe .",
    "it is also noteworthy that their alternative portfolios were less riskier with thinner downside tails . as an extension of the work by @xcite ,",
    "reward - risk momentum strategies using classical tempered stable ( cts ) distributions were implemented in various asset classes ( @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of asset class and market , it was found that the alternative strategies ranked by the cts reward - risk measures exhibit better performances and risk profiles .",
    "these results are also consistent with the low - volatility anomaly ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most popular risk measures in practice is maximum drawdown defined as the worst cumulative loss from a peak in a given period .",
    "maximum drawdown is also used in the definitions of the calmar ratio and the sterling ratio in order to assess performances and risks of mutual funds and hedge funds .",
    "several advantages of maximum drawdown over value - at - risk ( var ) and conditional var ( cvar ) are the followings .",
    "first of all , it is more insightful than var and cvar .",
    "when two historical price charts are given , it is more straightforward to recognize which asset has the smaller maximum drawdown .",
    "additionally , it is easier to calculate maximum drawdown directly from time series , because it is a simple sum of log - returns in the drawdown period .",
    "moreover , there is no model dependency .",
    "for example ,",
    "vars and cvars calculated from gaussian distributions are different with the risk measures from heavy - tailed distributions .",
    "finally , maximum drawdown encodes much information on asset price evolution .",
    "even though parameters of a given probability distribution are identical , a random permutation of a given time series produces a different maximum drawdown .    in this paper , we introduce multiple composite ranking criteria , originated from maximum drawdown and successive recovery , and construct alternative momentum / contrarian - style portfolios in order to test predictability of the alternative ranking measures .",
    "monthly momentum and weekly contrarian strategies based on the alternative stock selection rules are implemented in us and south korea stock markets .",
    "it is noteworthy that the new selection rules exhibit better predictability on asset prices , because the alternative strategies outperform the traditional cumulative return - based strategies in performance and risk management .",
    "in particular , drawdown measures provide better trend - following strategies in a monthly scale and recovery criteria work well with the weekly strategies . the dominance in predictability and performance is also found in the carhart four - factor model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in next section ,",
    "new ranking rules based on maximum drawdown and sequential recovery are defined . in section [ sec_mddr_momentum_data_method ] , datasets and methodologies",
    "are introduced .",
    "performances and risk profiles for the alternative portfolios are presented in section [ sec_mddr_momentum_result ] .",
    "factor analysis on momentum returns is given in section [ sec_mddr_momentum_factor_analysis ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec_mddr_momentum_conclusion ] .",
    "as mentioned before , maximum drawdown is the worst loss among successive declines from peaks to troughs during a given period . at time",
    "@xmath0 , it is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the log - price at time @xmath3 . it can be expressed with log - returns : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the log - return between @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "the maximum drawdown is regarded as the worst - case scenario to an investor if the investor starts his / her investment at any moments in the period .",
    "it is obvious for investors to prefer smaller maximum drawdowns to larger drawdowns in portfolio performance .",
    "it is noteworthy that maximum drawdown is closely related to price momentum .",
    "for example , the direction and magnitude of price momentum are affected by maximum drawdown . for positive momentum ,",
    "maximum drawdown is regarded as a part of mean - reversion process , if the extent of the maximum drawdown is small . meanwhile ,",
    "if it is large enough , the maximum drawdown is more likely to break the original upward trend and generates a new downward trend .",
    "additionally , it is straightforward that the drawdown also contributes to downside momentum .",
    "larger maximum drawdown would be much preferred for short - selling assets .    the successive recovery after the maximum drawdown is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the time moment for the end of the maximum drawdown formation .",
    "it imposes how much loss from the worst decline is recovered by the short - term reversion .",
    "similar to maximum drawdown , it is also helpful to understand the price momentum .",
    "when an asset price is on the upward trend , it is regarded as the support to the initial trend .",
    "meanwhile , the recovery in downside momentum is a reversion against the overall trend .",
    "it is obvious that an asset with stronger recovery is favored for long position than an asset with weaker recovery .",
    "contrary to the long position , smaller recovery might be preferred for short - selling .    in this",
    "regard , maximum drawdown and consecutive recovery are indispensable in the processes of detecting and analyzing signals for price trending and reversion .",
    "it is obvious that these aspects should be incorporated into momentum analysis and portfolio construction .",
    "it is possible to construct new composite selection rules stemming from the maximum drawdown and the recovery .",
    "for example , even if two assets have the same cumulative return , assets with larger maximum drawdowns needs to be penalized in portfolio construction . in another case",
    ", an asset with stronger short - term recovery would be preferred in the alternative ranking systems .",
    "it is impossible for the traditional ranking criterion to discern the characteristics of the price evolution in past history .    before developing new alternative selection rules",
    ", we need to take a closer look on cumulative return . a given estimation period is chronologically decomposed into the following three sub - periods .",
    "the first sub - period is a peak formulation phase which ranges from the beginning of the estimation period to the peak before the maximum downfall . in the next sub - period",
    ", the maximum drawdown has been progressed .",
    "the last sub - period is a recovery stage from the moment of the maximum drawdown formulation to the end of the estimation period .",
    "the above decomposition on the cumulative log - return @xmath9 is represented with log - returns in the three different phases : @xmath10 where pp , mdd and r are the log - returns during the pre - peak sub - period , drawdown sub - period and recovery sub - period , respectively .    exploiting the above decomposition",
    ", it is possible to construct hybrid indicators based on cumulative return , maximum drawdown and recovery .",
    "taking a weighted average with extra weights on certain specific sub - periods is one way of developing new stock selection rules .",
    "possible combinations with maximum drawdown and consecutive recovery are given in table [ tbl_mddr_ranking_criteria_desc ] .",
    "since the pre - peak return @xmath11 is based on relatively older information on price evolution , it could be erased by maximum drawdown and adjacent recovery , and this is why no alternative rules related to @xmath11 is devised .",
    ".description on alternative selection rules using maximum drawdown and recovery [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl_mddr_ranking_criteria_desc ]    let us reiterate meanings of alternative selection rules in table [ tbl_mddr_ranking_criteria_desc ] .",
    "the c strategy is used as the benchmark strategy .",
    "it is the traditional momentum / contrarian strategy that employs cumulative return in an estimation period as a ranking criterion .",
    "the m and the r portfolios are constructed from maximum drawdown and recovery , respectively .",
    "more complicated selection rules are produced by different weights on certain periods .",
    "the rm strategy utilizes the difference between recovery and maximum drawdown .",
    "it indicates the net loss such that the maximum drawdown is restored by the short - term recovery adjacent to the maximum drawdown .",
    "the cm strategy not only considers cumulative return and but also pays attention to the maximum drawdown during the estimation period .",
    "the ranking criterion gives a penalty to assets with large drawdowns . in the similar ways",
    ", it is possible to assign weights on only the recovery period or both the maximum drawdown sub - period and the recovery sub - period in order to construct the cr and the cmr strategies , respectively .",
    "the dataset for this study consists of the kospi 200 universe , the spdr us sector etf pool and the s&p 500 universe .",
    "the kospi 200 is a stock benchmark index that is the value - weighted and sector - diversified index of main 200 stocks in south korea stock markets .",
    "historical price information and the component - roster are downloaded from korea exchange .",
    "the period from january 2003 to december 2012 is considered .",
    "sector etfs are selected for simulating sector momentum which uses alternative stock selection rules . in particular ,",
    "the spdr us sector etfs are chosen because it is the sector etf collection in which the equal length of price history is available for all sectors .",
    "the spdr us sector etf pool includes xlb ( materials ) , xle ( energy ) , xlf ( financial ) , xli ( industrial ) , xlk ( technology ) , xlp ( consumer staples ) , xlu ( utilities ) , xlv ( health care ) and xly ( consumer discretionary ) .",
    "the time span covers from january 1999 to december 2012 and the data source is bloomberg .      the price information and the roster of the s&p 500 historical components are collected from bloomberg .",
    "the time horizon starts from january 1993 and ends in december 2012 .      the basic methodology for portfolio construction is building momentum - style ( or contrarian ) portfolios as given in @xcite .",
    "assets in a market universe are sorted by a given selection rule during an estimation period in ascending order .",
    "the lengths of an estimation period are 6 months for momentum strategies and 6 weeks for contrarian strategies . in this study , most criteria , except for maximum drawdown , are ranked in increasing order of the scoring criteria . after the assets are sorted , several ranking baskets are formed . in the s&p 500 and the kospi 200 universes ,",
    "the number of the ranking groups is 10 .",
    "meanwhile , three ranking baskets are used for the spdr us sector etfs , because the number of assets in the etf universe is much smaller than those for the previous two universes .",
    "the group 1 is for losers with the worst ranking scores , and the highest ranking group is for the best performers in the given selection rule . in other words , with the alternative selection rules based on maximum drawdown and recovery , loser groups gather much riskier assets and winner baskets have less riskier assets . each ranking group is constructed as an equally - weighted portfolio with the assets in the group . for a monthly momentum ( weekly contrarian )",
    "strategy , the winner group is on a long ( short ) position and the loser group is on a short ( long ) position .",
    "the size of the long position is exactly same as that of the short position in order to make the entire long - short portfolio dollar - neutral .",
    "after the holding period of 6 months ( weeks ) , each basket is liquidated .",
    "the portfolio is regularly constructed at the beginning of every month ( week ) , i.e. , it is an overlapping portfolio .",
    "risk measures for momentum / contrarian portfolio performances are calculated from daily time series of the overlapping portfolios .",
    "the maximum drawdown is directly computed from empirical distributions .",
    "the risk model for daily value - at - risk ( var ) , conditional var ( cvar ) and sharpe ratio is the arma(1,1)-garch(1,1 ) model with classical tempered stable ( cts ) innovations .",
    "this model is suggested by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and several applications of the model are found in finance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same model is also exploited for momentum portfolio construction ( @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic function of the cts distribution is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the location parameter , @xmath14 are the scale parameters , @xmath15 is the tail index and @xmath16 is the decay rates of upside / downside tails .",
    "all the cts parameters are positive real numbers and in particular , @xmath17 .",
    "from the viewpoint of risk management , @xmath15 and @xmath18 are important parameters .",
    "smaller @xmath15 values mean fatter tails in the cts distributions . similarly , thicker downside tails are controlled by lower levels of @xmath19 .",
    "the procedures for calculating var , cvar and sharpe ratio are the following steps ( @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , parameters of the arma - garch model with student s t - innovations are estimated from maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "residuals in the arma - garch model are considered as being generated from the probability distribution function of the cts distribution which is obtained from the fast - fourier transformation on the characteristic function of the cts distribution .",
    "after then the parameter estimation of the cts distribution is done by mle . for detailed information on the cts distribution and mle , consult with @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "according to table [ tbl_daily_summary_stat_risk_mddr_momentum_weekly_6_6_contrarian_kr_kp200 ] , ranking measures related to short - term recovery are robust prediction factors for cross - sectional contrarian signals in weekly scales in the kospi 200 .",
    "performances for the recovery - based contrarian strategies are not only better in average return but also less volatile in standard deviation than that of the traditional mean - reversion strategy , weekly 0.073% in average under volatility of 2.841% .",
    "the best performer is the recovery portfolio with weekly 0.146% , two - times larger than the average return of the original contrarian strategy .",
    "additionally , stronger consistency in the portfolio performance is guaranteed by much smaller standard deviation of 1.757% , almost 40%-decreased with respect to the volatility of the c strategy . the cr and",
    "the cmr strategies also obtain better weekly average returns of 0.086% and 0.078% with smaller standard deviations of 2.665% and 2.865% , respectively",
    ". meanwhile , maximum drawdown - related ranking rules , such as the m , the cm and the rm selection rules , poorly predict directions of asset prices comparing with the benchmark measure .",
