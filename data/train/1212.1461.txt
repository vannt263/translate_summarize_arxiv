    "over the last few years , observational evidence has accumulated that few , if any , globular clusters ( gcs ) consist of a single stellar population with a well - defined age and chemical composition . instead , multiple stellar populations have been observed in a number of massive galactic gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "photometric evidence for multiple populations comes in the form of split sequences in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) during at least one of the various stellar evolutionary phases , i.e. main sequence , sub - giant branch , horizontal branch , etc .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more detailed spectroscopic studies have shown that the different stellar populations within the same gc often show differences in the relative abundances of light elements involved in the proton - capture process such as c , n , o , f , na , mg , al , or si ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can only be explained if the different stellar populations are born from gas with different chemical compositions .",
    "a popular scenario to explain the time - variable chemistry of the gas reservoir invokes the `` pollution '' of the pristine gas by the chemically enriched winds from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars of the first stellar generation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this `` self - enrichment '' scenario , however , is complicated by the fact that the spectroscopic data also demonstrate that the different stellar populations in a gc often show the same abundances of iron peak and other elements that are produced in type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) .",
    "the chemical peculiarities also can not be limited to surface contamination , or they would be diluted after the first dredge - up episode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "currently , no scenario offered to explain the presence of multiple populations in gcs is able to fully explain the peculiar abundance anomalies , at least not without resorting to a non - canonical initial mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , the merging of primordial clusters or gas clumps struggles to simultaneously explain both the similarities in the @xmath2-element abundances and the differences in the light element abundances ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the simplest solution to explain these peculiar abundance patterns is that an efficient mechanism for gas depletion must have operated after the formation of the first generation , but before the birth of the second generation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "building on previous work @xcite , the following picture for the formation of multiple stellar populations in massive gcs has therefore been proposed by @xcite : the most massive members of the first stellar generation quickly reach the end of their lifetime and explode as sne ii .",
    "the energy injected into the ism from these explosions can remove the material that is enriched in @xmath2-process elements from the gc , and can interrupt the star formation . over time , a second gas reservoir is then created from the ejecta of either agb stars @xcite or rotating massive stars @xcite , combined with any remaining ( and/or additional ) pristine gas . after a few hundred myrs , a second generation of stars is born from this mix of processed and unprocessed material .",
    "to first order , this scenario could explain the observed abundance variations in the light elements while avoiding differences in the @xmath2-element abundances .    however , the question is whether the sne ii can indeed remove ( only ) the gas component that is enriched in @xmath2-elements .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that this is only feasible in clusters less massive than @xmath3 @xcite , because more massive clusters contain enough gas mass that the sne ii can not plausibly unbind it all .",
    "the masses of present - day gcs are likely to be only a small fraction of their original mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that for the most massive galactic gcs , including @xmath4cen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc 1851 @xcite , 47 tuc @xcite , ngc 6752 @xcite , m22 @xcite , and others , it appears likely that the initial gas reservoir had a mass of at least @xmath3 , and probably more .",
    "it thus appears doubtful that sne ii were able to efficiently remove the @xmath2-enhanced gas from these clusters .",
    "a number of alternative scenarios for the `` purging '' of the gas reservoir in massive stellar clusters can be found in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite invoke galactic plane passages and the associated ram pressure stripping of the gas content to explain the enrichment history of @xmath4cen , thus elaborating on earlier work by @xcite .",
    "however , in order for this scenario to explain the multiple stellar populations in an arbitrary gc , some fine - tuning between their age difference and the orbital period of the cluster may be required . in many cases ,",
    "the orbital period could be altogether too long for this mechanism to be viable , particularly for clusters at large galacto - centric radii .",
    "another alternative was proposed by @xcite who invokes the relativistic winds of millisecond pulsars as a catalyst for gas expulsion .",
    "lastly , the feedback from x - ray binary jets onto the ism could also contribute ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the precise mechanism for gas depletion in primordial gcs is currently unknown , the effects on the subsequent cluster evolution can be dramatic .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that rapid gas expulsion can unbind a significant fraction of stars in the cluster outskirts .",
    "it can even result in complete cluster dissolution , especially in the absence of primordial mass segregation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , in addition to accounting for the peculiar abundance anomalies , gas depletion could play a crucial role in deciding the present - day relative numbers of first and second generation stars in gcs hosting multiple populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider yet another mechanism for the removal of gas after an initial burst of star formation , namely the accretion of the ism onto compact stellar remnants such as black holes and neutron stars .",
    "this scenario is appealing because it can significantly deplete the gas reservoir even for very large initial cluster masses , and does not require any specific orbital conditions .",
    "we will show that , in principle , the most massive stellar black holes with parent stars at the high end of the initial mass function ( imf ) can be very effective in depleting the gas within the cluster .",
    "this can significantly modify the final black hole ( bh ) mass distribution , and therefore accelerate the phase of bh - bh ejections that , as theoretical studies suggest , should remove most bhs from the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high - mass end of the stellar initial mass function of primordial gcs and , by extension , the number of bh progenitors is highly uncertain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in open clusters and star - forming associations ,",
    "however , it has been shown that the maximum imf mass correlates with the total cluster mass , and stars sufficiently massive to be the progenitors of bhs should form in clusters more massive than @xmath5 m@xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we expect that at least some bhs should have formed in a typical primordial gc . in support of this",
    ", there now exists compelling observational evidence in favour of bhs residing in present - day gcs .",
    "@xcite confirmed the first such bh in the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 in the virgo cluster .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported two flat - spectrum radio sources in the galactic globular cluster m22 , which the authors argue are accreting stellar - mass bhs .",
    "this result suggests that the dynamical ejection of bhs from clusters may not be as efficient as previously predicted , and that a cluster such as m22 could contain on the order of @xmath7 stellar - mass bhs .",
    "observational evidence has also been reported in favour of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) existing in the globular cluster m54 .",
    "@xcite first reported the detection of stellar density and kinematic cusps in m54 , which they interpreted as being due to the presence of a central bh with a mass of @xmath8 m@xmath6 .",
    "more recently , however , @xcite used chandra and hubble space telescope astrometry to rule out the existence of an x - ray counterpart to the proposed imbh , and placed an improved upper limit on its luminosity of l(8.5 ghz ) @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , the observational evidence supports the presence of at least some bhs in present - day gcs . assuming that bhs are efficiently ejected during the dynamical evolution of the cluster , it seems likely that a more substantial population of stellar - mass bhs once existed in primordial gcs .    following this introduction ,",
    "we describe in  [ sec : initial ] our assumptions for the initial conditions , i.e. the stellar mass function and dynamical state of the cluster at the time of bh formation . using an analytic closed - box model for the evolution of the remnant mass function due to accretion from the ism , we consider two theoretical models for accretion of ism onto a black hole , namely the bondi - hoyle approximation and the eddington limit . these models , which are described in more detail in  [ sec : accmodels ] , represent two different mass - dependencies for the accretion rate",
    ". the results of our analysis , which are presented in  [ sec : results ] , show that the accretion of gas onto compact stellar remnants can have a significant effect on subsequent episodes of star formation , and even present - day mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings on models of gc formation in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , and summarize our work in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we present an analytic model for the formation of a massive star cluster from its parent giant molecular cloud .      we consider a molecular cloud of total mass @xmath11 that condenses to form a star cluster at time @xmath12 .",
    "we assume a star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of 25% , so that , after the cluster is born , the total mass in stars and gas are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . while this value for the sfe agrees with available theoretical constraints ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we point out that our results are insensitive to the precise value of the sfe , as long as it is neither extremely low or extremely high . in the first limit",
    ", the stellar mass of the infant cluster would be too small for many massive stars to form , and hence the number of bhs would be limited . at the other extreme , an extremely high sfe would leave little gas , and hence the bhs could not grow significantly in mass .",
    "our chosen value for the sfe stays safely away from these regimes .",
    "we assume an initial mass function for the stellar population according to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of stars with a given stellar mass @xmath17 , and @xmath2 and @xmath18 are constants .",
    "we assume a power - law slope of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this choice minimizes the number of high - mass stars relative to other imfs used in the literature , so that the estimates we derive in  [ sec : results ] for the number of stellar remnants and the amount of gas accreted by them are conservative .    as a technical point",
    ", the parameter @xmath18 is needed to ensure that the correct total stellar mass is preserved when integrating the imf .",
    "it is determined by normalizing equation  [ eqn : imf ] using the total stellar mass : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the minimum and maximum stellar masses , respectively . integrating equation  [ eqn : imf_norm ] with respect to @xmath17 and solving for @xmath18 yields : @xmath23 plausible values for the upper and lower",
    "mass cut - off at low metallicity are @xmath24 m@xmath6 and @xmath25 m@xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , we consider several different values for @xmath22 in order to test the sensitivity of our results to this assumption .",
    "the mass cut - off values are chosen to be conservative for very low metallicity since , as we will show , a higher initial maximum bh mass translates into a shorter gas depletion timescale .",
    "it follows that our results correspond to upper limits for the gas depletion timescale due to accretion onto stellar - mass bhs .      in order to calculate the relative velocity between the accretor and the gas ( which affects the accretion rate ) as well as the retention fraction of stellar remnants",
    "after they experience a potential natal kick , the velocity distribution of the progenitor population is required .    in this respect , we assume that the core radius @xmath26 is initially comparable to the half - mass radius @xmath27 , since primordial clusters are expected to be more extended than their ( dynamically evolved ) present - day counter - parts ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we further assume primordial mass segregation , i.e. that all remnants form inside @xmath26 , and that energy equipartition has been achieved within @xmath26 ( we will come back to these assumptions in  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we therefore adopt a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution for the progenitors at every stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of stars with mass @xmath17 , @xmath30 is the velocity dispersion for stars of mass @xmath17 , and @xmath31 is the stellar velocity . for the velocity dispersion @xmath30 , we assume @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the central velocity dispersion of the average stellar mass @xmath34 . for a king model ,",
    "this is @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath26 is the core radius , @xmath36 is the average stellar mass density in the core , and @xmath37 is the average gas mass density in the core .      for the progenitor lifetime @xmath38 , we assume that the main - sequence ( ms ) lifetime @xmath39 provides a good approximation , provided the progenitor mass is @xmath40 m@xmath6 .",
    "this seems justified because the ms lifetimes of low - mass stars greatly exceed that of every other evolutionary phase , typically by several orders of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that @xmath39 is a function of only the stellar mass .",
    "in other words , we are ignoring any metallicity - dependence , since metallicity should only weakly affect the total stellar lifetime .",
    "for the ms lifetime , we assume @xcite : @xmath41 with @xmath42 years . for progenitor masses @xmath43 m@xmath6 , we impose a fixed total lifetime of 7 myrs ( note that equation  [ eqn : tau_ms ] yields the same ms lifetime of 7 myrs for @xmath44 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "this is in rough agreement with stellar evolution models ( rob izzard , private communication ) , which predict a near constant lifetime for massive stars at low metallicty ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , our final estimate for the total progenitor lifetime is : @xmath45      for the initial remnant masses , we use equations 4 , 5 , 7 , and 9 from @xcite for progenitors in the mass ranges @xmath46/m@xmath47 , @xmath48/m@xmath49 , @xmath50 m / m@xmath51 , @xmath52/m@xmath53 , and @xmath54 m@xmath6 , respectively . in that order ,",
    "the initial remnant masses are : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the progenitor and remnant masses , respectively , in units of solar masses , and we have used @xmath62 , with @xmath63 denoting solar metallicity .",
    "this choice of metallicity roughly agreees with the average for milky way gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and should be appropriate for a star cluster composed of population ii stars .    for each progenitor mass range ,",
    "two equations are given in @xcite for the initial - final mass relations , one assuming a delayed supernova explosion and the other assuming a rapid explosion .",
    "the delayed explosion model predicts considerably greater kick velocities that are roughly consistent with what is observed for pulsars in the galactic field @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume a delayed supernova explosion in choosing our initial - final mass relations .",
    "however , we note that our results are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "this is because the gas accretion is completely dominated by the most massive bhs , specifically those with masses @xmath64 m@xmath6 . in this high - mass regime ,",
    "the differences in the final remnant mass functions between the delayed and rapid explosion models of @xcite are negligible .",
    "for the same reason , we do not discuss gas accretion onto nss and white dwarfs ( wds ) further : they do not affect the results presented here . nevertheless , in order to check the plausibility of our assumptions , we compare the retention fractions of nss to previous estimates in the literature in  [ nss ] .",
    "the accretion rate depends on the relative velocity between the gas and the accretor .",
    "thus , it is important to obtain a realistic final remnant velocity distribution from the initial progenitor velocity distribution .    the primary factor that determines the initial remnant velocity distribution is natal kicks .",
    "these are imparted to most nss , and some ( low - mass ) bhs , at the time of their formation .",
    "the precise physical mechanism responsible is unknown , but appears to be related to asymmetries in the collapse of the progenitor core , or the subsequent supernova explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "typical kick speeds range from 100 to 200 km s@xmath65 , although radio pulsars with speeds in excess of 1000 km s@xmath10 have been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath71/m@xmath6 @xmath72 , we adopt a constant kick velocity of @xmath73 , since the amount of fallback is thought to be less sensitive to the explosion mechanism in this range of progenitor masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , for progenitors with @xmath17/m@xmath74 , we assume prompt collapse to a bh without a supernova explosion , and thus without any kick .    in order to calculate the initial velocity distribution for our remnant population ,",
    "we add the kick velocity @xmath70 to a randomly drawn velocity @xmath75 from equation  [ eqn : mbvel ] for the appropriate progenitor mass .",
    "this is done using randomized vector addition , since there is no reason to expect that the direction of the kick should be correlated with the direction of motion of the progenitor through its host cluster .",
    "the resulting velocity @xmath76 is then compared to the escape velocities from both the core and the cluster .",
    "the latter quantities are calculated using the relations @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total ( stellar and gas ) mass of the core , @xmath11 is the total ( stellar and gas ) cluster mass , and @xmath26 is the core radius ( recall that we have assumed that @xmath80 initially ) .",
    "a comparison between @xmath76 and @xmath81 determines the ns and bh retention fractions immediately after their formation .",
    "if the final velocity is less than the escape velocity of the core ( i.e. @xmath82 ) , we leave it unchanged from the velocity previously drawn from the distribution in equation  [ eqn : mbvel ] .",
    "this is because we assume that the remnant will rapidly re - achieve energy equipartition with the rest of the core , where the local relaxation time is much shorter than the global relaxation time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the remnant ends up with a velocity greater than the escape velocity from the cluster immediately after it receives its kick ( i.e. @xmath83 ) , then it is removed completely from the remnant population . however ,",
    "if the post - kick velocity exceeds the escape velocity from the core but not that from the cluster ( i.e. @xmath84 ) , then the remnant will temporarily leave the core but still remain bound to the cluster . in this case",
    ", we calculate the radius to which the remnant is kicked ( called the `` kick radius '' ) using conservation of energy .",
    "this requires two additional assumptions , namely that the kick is always imparted at a distance @xmath85 from the cluster centre , and the resulting orbit of the kicked remnant within its host cluster is entirely radial .",
    "we then calculate the fall - back time @xmath86 , which decides when the remnant will return to the core .",
    "this is given by : @xmath87 this assumption is justified given that primordial gcs are thought to have been more extended at birth than they are now .",
    "it follows that stars should be relatively unaffected by dynamical friction once outside the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the time from cluster birth until the gas reservoir is depleted , then the remnant will return to the core with enough time to accrete at least some gas from the dense ism .",
    "once in the core , the remnant quickly re - achieves energy equipartition with the surrounding population . the remnant s",
    "final velocity is then once again given by equation  [ eqn : mbvel ] .",
    "the bondi - hoyle approximation describes spherically symmetric accretion , and is based on the assumption that the forces due to gas pressure are insignificant compared to gravitational forces @xcite .",
    "the background gas is treated as uniform and either stationary or moving with constant velocity relative to the accretor .",
    "this assumption gives reasonable accretion rates , provided the properties of the gas are such that the density and total angular momentum are low , at least in the vicinity of the accretor .",
    "numerical studies have confirmed that this is indeed the case , provided the gas is not moving rapidly relative to the accretor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is not unreasonable since the timescale for accretion to occur is comparable to the crossing time of the core , even for accretion rates lower than the eddington rate .",

    "a possibly more important consequence of a lower average bh velocity is that it could lead to a more efficient migration of massive bhs towards the cluster centre , and thus could accelerate the onset of the dynamical bh ejection phase ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "for example , for an imf upper mass cut - off of 150 m@xmath6 ( dashed line ) , the most massive bh reaches an accretion rate of @xmath118 m@xmath6 yr@xmath10 after only @xmath119 myrs . at this point , it enters a phase of runaway growth and , as shown in figure  [ fig : massfrac_bh ] , the remnant mass fraction rises asymptotically from only a few percent to nearly 80% in as little as a few thousand years .",
    "thus , in the bondi - hoyle case , the entire gas reservoir is depleted within a few myrs of cluster formation , nearly independent of our assumption for the imf upper mass cut - off .",
    "it follows that the gas depletion time will be under 1 gyr provided the accretion rate @xmath120 .    in the case of eddington - limited accretion ( figure  [ fig : massfrac_edd ] ) , in contrast ,",
    "a runaway accretion phase is never reached , because of the weaker ( linear ) dependence of accretion rate on bh mass .",
    "consequently , the remnant mass fraction rises gradually at first over a period of several tens of myrs , reaching 5 - 10% ( depending on the assumed imf upper mass cut - off ) within @xmath121 myrs of cluster formation .",
    "nevertheless , the accretion rate continues to rise as the bhs grow in mass and , after @xmath122 myrs , the remnant mass fraction reaches 20 - 40% .",
    "thus , provided the accretion rate @xmath123 , accretion onto stellar - mass bhs will significantly contribute to depleting the available gas reservoir within a few hundred myrs .",
    "the key conclusion from these plots is that , in both accretion models , stellar - mass bhs cause a non - negligible reduction in the total mass of the gas reservoir within as little as a few tens of myrs .",
    "this is the case even if we truncate the imf upper mass cut - off at 60 m@xmath6 , which is considerably lower than what is theoretically predicted for massive stars at very low metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of a larger initial bh mass are also demonstrated in figure  [ fig : mmax ] , which shows the maximum bh mass as a function of time for three different assumptions for the upper mass cut - off for the imf , namely 150 , 100 , and 60 m@xmath6 . in the bondi - hoyle case , the upper limit for each mass is obtained by dividing the remaining gas mass by the number of bhs in the highest - mass bin ( 2 , 6 , and 19 for an imf upper - mass cut - off of 150 , 100 , and 60 m@xmath6 , respectively ) at the time when runaway accretion sets in .",
    "this represents a _ theoretical _ upper limit to the maximum final bh mass .",
    "we caution that , in the bondi - hoyle case , such extreme bh masses conflict with current _ observational _ upper limits in several massive gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results show that the assumed model for the accretion rate and its dependence on accretor mass can have a significant effect on the final distribution of remnant masses .",
    "interestingly , in the bondi - hoyle case , the accretion rates can become sufficiently high that , if one or a few bhs reach these rates well before their peers , there will be a large discrepancy between the final masses of these bhs and the rest .",
    "it is even feasible that one especially massive bh ( or intermediate - mass bh ) will completely dominate the accretion `` race '' .",
    "the possible implications of this case for the subsequent dynamical evolution of the bh population and the evolving cluster mass - to - light ratio will be discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , kicks have a minor effect on bh population size due to the fact that it is only low - mass bhs that receive kicks . for initial cloud masses @xmath124 and @xmath125 m@xmath6 , we find bh retention fractions of roughly 66% , 90% , and 96% respectively",
    ". kicks also do not significantly affect the gas depletion times since low - mass bhs have the lowest accretion rates .",
    "this assumes , however , that the imf upper mass cut - off is sufficiently large that the most massive bhs will not receive kicks ( see  [ remnant_vel ] ) .",
    "due to their relatively small masses , accretion leaves the numbers of nss largely unchanged for up to @xmath122 myrs . even in the bondi - hoyle case",
    ", many of the first nss to form will only accrete enough material within this time - frame to end up as especially massive nss , as opposed to low - mass bhs .",
    "thus , the primary factor affecting ns population size in the core is natal kicks .",
    "we can therefore consistently compare the ns retention fractions we obtain for our model to previous estimates given in the literature calculated using more sophisticated methods .",
    "this is meant to provide a test of the validity of our assumptions . for initial cloud masses",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 m@xmath6 , we find ns retention fractions of roughly 14% , 37% , and 73% , respectively .",
    "recently , @xcite used monte carlo models for gc evolution to look at ns retention due to natal kicks .",
    "our results are in close agreement with theirs for an initial cloud mass @xmath126 m@xmath6 with 25% star formation efficiency , which yields a total stellar mass that agrees roughly with the cluster mass considered by @xcite .",
    "were adopted .",
    "the dashed , dotted , and solid lines correspond to an imf upper mass cut - off of 150 , 100 , and 60 m@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this plot is insensitive to our assumption for the total cloud mass @xmath11 , provided @xmath127 m@xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : massfrac_bh ] ]    , but using the eddington limit to estimate the accretion rate .",
    "[ fig : massfrac_edd ] ]    , respectively .",
    "[ fig : mmax ] ]",
    "we now discuss the implications of our results for the dynamical ejection of bhs , subsequent episodes of star formation , and the present - day cluster mass - to - light ratio .",
    "several theoretical studies suggest that bhs which form soon after the formation of a massive star cluster should decouple dynamically from the rest of the stellar population due to their much larger masses . consequently",
    ", if they do nt already form in the cluster core they will rapidly segregate there ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inside the core , bh - bh binaries form dynamically through three - body scattering interactions , and most bhs are thought to be eventually ejected from the cluster due to strong gravitational interactions with other bh - bh binaries . however",
    ", it is expected to take at least a few gyrs for the bulk of the primordial bh population to be depleted in this way @xcite , and some studies suggest that the required time could even exceed a hubble time for some clusters @xcite .",
    "recent studies also suggest that , in general , dynamical bh ejection may not be effective enough to remove the entire bh population from the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the absence of bh - bh mergers , we expect accretion to accelerate the rate of dynamical bh ejections , because mass growth of a bh will increase its gravitationally - focused cross - section for encounters .",
    "consequently , if most bhs experience a significant mass growth , the average time between close encounters ( i.e. fly - bys ) involving bhs should also decrease .",
    "moreover , the velocity of an accreting bh will be reduced significantly if its mass increases _ on time scales that are short compared to the central relaxation time _ so that it is not re - accelerated by the cluster potential . in this case , conservation of momentum predicts that the final post - accretion velocity is : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the initial bh velocity , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the initial ( pre - accretion ) and final ( post - accretion ) bh masses , respectively .",
    "such a reduction in the average bh velocity will also reduce the average time between bh - bh encounters , which is linearly proportional to the relative velocity between interacting objects .",
    "for example , an increase in the average bh mass by a factor of @xmath130 , and the ensuing decrease of the average bh velocity by a factor of @xmath130 could result in a decrease in the average time between close bh - bh encounters by a factor of @xmath122 .",
    "this should probably be regarded as an upper limit , however , since mergers between bhs are likely inevitable at very low bh velocities .",
    "nonetheless , we conclude that an episode of accretion from the ism can significantly reduce the bh ejection timescale by a factor of several tens or more .",
    "if accreting bhs are indeed responsible for depleting the gas reservoir of a young stellar cluster , a second generation of stars can only be born after most bhs are dynamically ejected , because only then can gas re - accumulate within the cluster .",
    "previous studies have shown that the amount of gas built up from the winds of evolved stars and retained within the cluster can be significant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can be sufficient for a second generation of stars to be born .",
    "moreover , in order to explain the peculiar abundance anomalies observed in gcs hosting multiple populations , it seems that some pristine gas must also somehow re - accumulate within the cluster _",
    "after _ any polluted material due to sneii from the first generation is removed from the gas reservoir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in the previous section , our results suggest that the epoch of bh ejections stimulated via dynamical interactions between bh - bh binaries could end much sooner , depending on how much the bhs increase their mass via accretion .",
    "based on the results of previous theoretical estimates for this timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and typical age spreads estimated for multiple populations in massive gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we conclude that a scenario in which accreting bhs significantly deplete the gas reservoir and are nearly all dynamically - ejected from a primordial gc _ before _ the birth of a second stellar generation is not inconsistent with currently available observations and theoretical expectations .",
    "we caution , however , that the timescales for gas depletion and bh ejections are somewhat sensitive to the degree of initial mass segregation .",
    "this is because , at the large initial cluster masses thought to be needed to explain the observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the global relaxation time ( corresponding to the average stellar mass ) should be comparable to or exceed the age of the universe .",
    "however , whenever a remnant forms , its progenitor is the most massive star in the cluster , and many bhs should be born with masses @xmath122 times larger than the average stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the progenitors of bhs will likely migrate into the core first , given that the timescale for mass segregation for a star of mass @xmath17 is approximately @xcite : @xmath131 here , @xmath34 is the average stellar mass and @xmath132 is the half - mass relaxation time ( which can be used to estimate the global rate of two - body relaxation ) .",
    "once a star is inside @xmath26 , the local relaxation time can be shorter than the global or half - mass relaxation time by a factor of 100 or more ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the key point is that , with or without primordial mass segregation , the stellar remnants of the most massive progenitors are likely to be found in the cluster core very early on , and to be dynamically relaxed .    as a mechanism for gas depletion , accretion onto stellar - mass bhs has the advantage that it can potentially help to explain why stars belonging to the second stellar generations in massive gcs do not always show evidence for enrichment in iron - peak elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "_ this is because the accreting bhs can remove the polluted material from the sneii of the first generation _ before _ the second generation is born .",
    "_ however , we have not considered dynamical ejections that occur between massive stars while still on the main - sequence , an effect that should be considered in future studies .",
    "finally , the effects of accreting bhs on the _ first _ episode of star formation should also be considered , since it may be important if star formation is an extended process .",
    "in fact , if the most massive stars reach the end of their lives while star formation is still ongoing , gas accretion onto their bh remnants could reduce the number of first generation stars , and affect the shape of the imf . to summarize , independent of the exact scenario , our results demonstrate that accretion onto bhs could significantly affect the star formation histories of massive globular clusters .    on the other hand",
    ", while the bhs of the first stellar generation offer a potentially attractive mechanism for gas depletion , their continued gas accretion would pose a problem for the formation of the second stellar generation , unless the bhs are efficiently removed from the cluster core after their formation .",
    "this should be considered in any proposed scenario explaining the complex star formation history of globular clusters .",
    "depleting the gas reservoir via accretion does not necessarily require that the accreted matter end up bound to the accretor(s ) .",
    "if the accretion rate surpasses the eddington limit , powerful winds could develop that might expel any remaining gas from the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that much of the emission could be in the uv , which could in turn result in photoionization heating of the ism beyond the escape velocity from the cluster .",
    "properly quantifying the implications of these effects requires detailed numerical modeling .",
    "this technology is currently unavailable in light of the considerable computational difficulties in achieving the necessary resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      the considerable uncertainties in the accretion rate onto bhs ,",
    "the stellar imf , and the total amount of accreted material make it difficult to accurately predict the final mass - to - light ratio of the stellar cluster from our simplistic model .    in general ,",
    "if the bhs accrete from the surrounding ism , and are retained by their host cluster ( e.g. the bhs merge rather than being dynamically ejected ) , one may expect a correlation between the cluster metallicity and its mass - to - light ratio . this is because theoretical studies suggest that the imf upper mass cut - off increases with decreasing metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which , in turn , accelerates the mass growth of bhs ( see  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "interestingly , such an anti - correlation between the metallicity of globular clusters and their mass - to - light ratio has indeed been observed by @xcite in m31 .    if , on the other hand , higher accretion rates result in a more efficient dynamical ejection of bhs , as discussed in  [ sec : dyn_ej ] , such that ( nearly ) all bhs are dynamically ejected , one may even expect a _ correlation _ between the cluster metallicity and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we conclude that a more sophisticated model is needed to constrain the dependence of the final mass - to - light ratio on metallicity .",
    "the key point arising from our model is that accretion from the ism onto a population of remnants in a primordial gc can significantly affect its present - day mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in this paper , we have considered accreting black holes as a mechanism to deplete primordial gcs of their gas after the birth of their progenitor population .",
    "this mechanism should be effective in clusters of all masses , as long as they are able to form massive stars that turn into bhs .",
    "we have considered both the bondi - hoyle approximation and the eddington limit in order to explore two different regimes in the mass - dependency of the accretion rate .",
    "our results suggest that accreting bhs are able to deplete the entire gas reservoir in as little as @xmath130 myrs , if the bondi - hoyle rate is assumed . even at significantly lower accretion rates on the order of the eddington limit",
    ", bhs can accrete a significant fraction of the total gas reservoir within a few tens of myrs .",
    "this timescale is sufficiently short that accreting bhs would significantly impact the chemistry of any subsequent episodes of star formation .",
    "the accretion rates are sensitive to the imf upper mass cut - off , in the sense that reducing the mass of the most massive bh by a factor of @xmath133 will result in gas depletion times that are longer by a factor of @xmath133 .    at the end of the accretion period",
    ", the average bhs will have significantly increased .",
    "this is likely to accelerate the dynamical decoupling of the bh population evolution from the rest of the cluster system , and thus may result in a more efficient ejection of the bh population from the cluster .",
    "we have discussed the implications of this effect on subsequent episodes of star formation .",
    "lastly , we have pointed out that accretion onto stellar remnants may significantly affect the present - day mass - to - light ratio , although we are currently unable to precisely quantify the magnitude of this effect .",

    "<S> we consider the effect of compact stellar remnants on the interstellar medium of a massive star cluster following the initial burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that accretion onto stellar - mass black holes is an effective mechanism for rapid gas depletion in clusters of all masses , as long as they contain progenitor stars more massive than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario appears especially attractive for the progenitor systems of present - day massive globular clusters which likely had masses above m @xmath1 . in such clusters , alternative mechanisms such as supernovae and stellar winds can not provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal of the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex chemical enrichment history .    in order to consider different regimes in the rate of gas accretion onto stellar mass black holes , we consider both the bondi - hoyle approximation as well as eddington - limited accretion . </S>",
    "<S> for either model , our results show that the cluster gas can be significantly depleted within only a few tens of myrs . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this process will affect the distribution of black hole masses and , by extension , may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of the black hole population and , ultimately , their dynamical ejection . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the timescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting black holes could significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes .    </S>",
    "<S> the gas depletion times and final mass in black holes are not only sensitive to the assumed model for the accretion rate , but also to the initial mass of the most massive black hole which , in turn , is determined by the upper mass cut - off of the stellar initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> given that the mass function of `` dark '' remnants is a crucial parameter for their dynamical ejection , our results imply that their accretion history can have an important bearing on the observed present - day cluster mass - to - light ratio . in particular , we show that the expected increase of the upper mass cut - off with decreasing metallicity could contribute to the observed anti - correlation between the mass - to - light ratio and the metallicity of globular clusters .    </S>",
