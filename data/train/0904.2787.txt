    "it is well known that the lightest two quarks ( up and down ) are almost identical in mass , at least when compared to the scale of the strong interaction in nuclear systems ( @xmath0  gev ) .",
    "this means that the two lightest quarks have almost identical strong interactions , i.e. , they are almost identical degrees of freedom . while the reason for this similarity is not yet understood , the corresponding approximate symmetry , isospin , is a remarkably effective tool in organizing and making sense of the vast landscape of nuclei and particles .",
    "this was realized very early on by heisenberg , who introduced the concept  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is common , and often very useful , to consider the proton and neutron to have the same properties under the strong interaction .",
    "this equivalence is called charge symmetry ( cs ) , which is a special case of isospin invariance . formally , cs is the invariance of the lagrangian under a @xmath1 rotation around the 2-axis in isospin space .",
    "its violation , fundamentally due to the different masses  @xcite and electromagnetic properties of the light quarks , is called charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) .",
    "the effects of csb can be detected in the properties of the hadrons .",
    "the most obvious and most important case is the neutron - proton mass difference , which would have opposite ( i.e. , negative ) sign ( the proton heavier , because of the coulomb interaction between the quarks ) if it was not for the quark mass difference .",
    "a heavier proton would lead to a different chart of nuclides and nuclear abundances ( since big - bang nucleosynthesis is crucially dependent on the relative abundances of neutrons and protons ) that would yield an entirely different universe than the one we live in .",
    "similar mass differences occur between other hadron isospin partners as well .",
    "some other important csb signals include the small difference between the neutron and proton analyzing power in @xmath2 elastic scattering  @xcite , the @xmath3-@xmath4 mixing  @xcite , the binding - energy difference between mirror nuclei ( the nolen - schiffer anomaly  @xcite ) , and the recently measured non - vanishing forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath5  @xcite and the @xmath6 signal for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "also a recent analysis of @xmath8 scattering data using chiral perturbation theory found a small csb effect  @xcite .",
    "( detailed reviews of this topic can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) however , for reasons that will soon become clear , the second - most important csb effect ( after the neutron - proton mass difference ) is the inequality of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering lengths .",
    "already early on it was discovered  @xcite that the wave function of the two - nucleon system could be well parameterized by a few parameters , independently of the shape of the assumed potential .",
    "the expression commonly seen in this context is the momentum / energy expansion of the ( @xmath11-wave ) phase shift @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the relative momentum , @xmath15 the scattering length and @xmath16 the effective range .",
    "this is the so - called effective range expansion ( ere ) , which has been widely used in treatments and applications of nucleon - nucleon interactions at low energies .",
    "as already mentioned , csb causes the scattering lengths of @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems to differ substantially .",
    "phenomenological calculations relate the difference between the scattering lengths to csb meson exchanges , e.g. , mixed @xmath3@xmath4 exchange .",
    "an evaluation of these calculations can be found in the csb review by miller and van oers  @xcite .",
    "the currently accepted values  @xcite are @xmath17 where the superscript ` str ' indicates that electromagnetic effects ( mainly coulomb for @xmath9 and magnetic - moment interaction for @xmath10 ) have been theoretically removed to reveal the strong interaction contribution to the scattering lengths .",
    "this large relative difference between the scattering lengths is a consequence of the reciprocal relationship between the scattering lengths and the potentials : @xmath18 where the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the wave functions and potentials for the indicated nucleon pairs , with the normalization @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the scattering length difference @xmath24 is related to the csb potential via an enhancing factor of 1015 : @xmath25 this enhancement is because of the large value of the scattering lengths ( compared to the range of the strong interaction)an example of fine tuning .",
    "thus , the scattering length difference is very sensitive to the finer details of the @xmath26 interaction , a fact that is used to pin down the csb part of the modern high - precision @xmath26 potentials  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are in turn used in very precise calculations of the energy levels of low - mass ( @xmath27 , say ) nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding calculation of the tritium  helium-3",
    "binding - energy difference is connected to the sign of @xmath24 , a fact which has long been known  @xcite .",
    "thus , with the currently accepted values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) and ( [ eq : ann ] ) ] , the theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "the charge dependent contribution to the @xmath30-@xmath31 binding energy difference is calculated to be 64  kev , to be compared to the total difference 757  kev .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experimental value 764  kev . in order to achieve this",
    "it is necessary to include state - of - the - art three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) , such as the urbana ix  @xcite , illinois  @xcite , brazil  @xcite , texas  @xcite and tucson - melbourne ( tm )  @xcite .",
    "however , if the sign of @xmath24 was reversed , , @xmath32 more negative than @xmath33 , this agreement would be off by more than 100  kev , since the csb part of the potential would change sign .",

    "there are two types of difficulties that have to be overcome to extract the proper scattering lengths .",
    "first , the electromagnetic interactions have to be removed , which can only be done theoretically , using sophisticated state - of - the - art tools .",
    "these corrections are huge for the proton - proton case  the uncorrected @xmath9 scattering length is -7.8063  fm  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the corrections is far from trivial , although it is well - known how to proceed .",
    "these extractions introduce a small model - dependence through the assumptions made about form factors  @xcite , i.e. , off - shell behavior .",
    "the electromagnetic corrections for @xmath33 are naturally much smaller and are dominated by the magnetic moment - magnetic moment interaction .",
    "calculations  @xcite reveal that this correction is -0.3  fm .",
    "second , the unavailability of dense enough free - neutron targets makes direct measurements almost impossible .",
    "nevertheless , there have been attempts to use direct @xmath10 scattering to determine @xmath33 , most recently one under way in snezhinsk  @xcite .",
    "these ideas , which so far have not yielded any results , will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : direct ] . because of this difficulty , our present knowledge of the @xmath10 scattering length is based exclusively on information gleaned from indirect reactions .",
    "the two main processes that have been used are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , both of which have a long and interesting history .",
    "they will be discussed at length in secs .",
    "[ sec : nd ] and [ sec : pid ] , respectively .",
    "this topical review will cover the efforts to extract @xmath33 over the last few decades , with particular focus on the developments since the review by slaus , akaishi , and tanaka  @xcite .",
    "some of the later results have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but no up - to - date comprehensive review is currently available .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to fill in this gap in the literature and bring the topic up to date . in an upcoming , lengthier , review also the earlier results and other specific issues ( like csb and chiral perturbation theory ) will be covered in more depth  @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind the indirect measurements of @xmath33 is to find a nuclear reaction which produces two free neutrons in a final state with low relative energy . by detecting neutrons in such a configuration [ the final state interaction ( fsi ) region where the scattering length plays an important role ] ,",
    "it is possible to extract a value for the scattering length .",
    "this is however only possible if a ) the detection of the neutrons , including full kinematic information , is possible to sufficient precision and efficiency , and b ) the corresponding theoretical calculation has small theoretical error bars . regardless of the reaction chosen , the extraction depends on theory and particularly on the sensitivity to @xmath33 in the chosen theoretical framework .",
    "since neutron detection is notoriously inefficient , it is often advantageous to detect instead another , more easily detected particle , such as a proton or photon , to constrain the relative energy and momentum of the neutrons .",
    "ideally , this third particle should have a comparatively weak interaction with the neutrons , so that its presence has limited influence on the process .",
    "this has led to proposals and experiments using electroweak processes , in particular the @xmath35 reaction .",
    "however , the bulk of experiments have relied on the basic ( though far from trivial ) deuteron breakup reaction @xmath34 .",
    "this process suffers from the possible complications of three - nucleon forces , which might be part of the reason for the conflicting results obtained for @xmath36 and @xmath37 experiments  @xcite .",
    "the deuteron breakup reaction has , throughout its entire ( including recent ) history , been suffering from significant disagreements between experiments .",
    "for this reason we treat this reaction first and temporarily postpone the discussion of the electroweak probe experiments .",
    "the deuteron break - up reaction @xmath34 has a long , unfortunate history of conflicting results . for a more detailed description of the earlier results see the previous reviews  @xcite , or the upcoming longer version of the present work  @xcite",
    ". the difficulties are both experimental and theoretical .",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite point out that the kinematically incomplete measurements in general extract @xmath38  fm , while the kinematically complete ones end up in the neighborhood of @xmath39  fm .",
    "however , a reanalysis of the kinematically incomplete experiments using state - of - the - art three - nucleon formalisms , including modern high - precision @xmath26 potentials and three - nucleon forces [ of the two - meson exchange tucson - melbourne ( tm ) kind  @xcite ] results in values around @xmath40  fm  @xcite .",
    "this drastic change in the kinematically incomplete experiments points to a strong dependence on the @xmath26 force used in the calculations . in the complete kinematics results ,",
    "however , the shape of the fsi peak is essentially determined by the value of @xmath33 with much reduced dependence on the choice of the @xmath26 potential  @xcite .",
    "the influence of @xmath26 and three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) was studied by witaa _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who found that for certain configurations the fsi peak is practically insensitive to the choice of @xmath26 interaction .",
    "also the effects of 3nf could be minimized at these angles .",
    "note , however , that this study used the tm 3nf only . with the modern development of effective field theories ( efts ) for the strong interaction of nucleons ( initiated by weinberg  @xcite ) , it is now possible to include the three(and four)-nucleon forces in the same theoretical framework as the two - nucleon force .",
    "this is not possible in the phenomenological approach mentioned above .",
    "one of the most important aspects here is that an eft allows for an expansion in a small parameter . for the cases of interest for this review ,",
    "the eft of choice is heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath41pt ) , with an expansion parameter @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is a typical energy or momentum of reactions involving low - energy nucleons and pions and @xmath44  gev is the scale at which the ( chiral ) expansion breaks down .",
    "if the relevant energies @xmath45 are sufficiently smaller than @xmath46 the expansion should converge .",
    "in addition , @xmath41pt organizes the different contribution to csb in a hierarchal structure , with the lowest order csb contribution to the nuclear force being determined by the @xmath47 difference  @xcite , again emphasizing the fundamental importance of this parameter .",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough introduction to and further details about hb@xmath41pt .",
    "significant progress has also been made for few - nucleon systems  @xcite , but no one has yet done chiral calculations needed for the extraction of @xmath33 from @xmath36 breakup . given the achievements of eft calculations in general ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the use of eft in processes involving electromagnetic probes ) and for @xmath33 extraction via the two - nucleon reactions in particular ( see secs .  [",

    "the most recent experimental results come from two different groups .",

    "they also reported results from the relative cross section at the fsi peak ( normalized in the @xmath2 fsi region ) : @xmath50 ( 25.3  mev ) and @xmath51  fm ( 16.6  mev ) . in order to facilitate comparisons they extracted also the @xmath2 scattering length at 25.2  mev in good agreement with other determinations .",

    "the extraction of @xmath52 in this case was done using the same detectors as used for extracting @xmath33 .",
    "it had been shown earlier , using the tm 3nf  @xcite , that the relative changes due to the 3nf were identical in the @xmath10 and @xmath2 peaks  @xcite .",

    "the main experimental difference between the two groups investigations is the chosen geometry for the @xmath10 system : bonn detected one neutron ( and the proton ) in what they called recoil geometry , i.e. , the neutron and proton on separate sides of the beam .",
    "tunl , on the other hand , used final - state geometry , where both neutrons are detected close together on the same side of the beam . also , while tunl extracted @xmath33 and @xmath52 simultaneously , the bonn set - up needed to change detectors to make the switch to the measurement of @xmath52 .",
    "the different geometries could also be a cause of theoretical concern .",
    "there is a ( perhaps small ) possibility that the predictions of the final - state geometry cross section is wrong  @xcite .",
    "one should also make certain that other implementations of 3nf ( urbana , illinois , texas , brazil , and chiral ) behave in a similar way . to my knowledge",
    "this has not been done .",
    "the bonn experiment is currently being set - up at tunl so that both experiments can be run at the same time , using the same neutron beam  @xcite .",
    "this is being done in order to reduce the possibility of experimental errors .",
    "the @xmath35 reaction has a long history , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details . in this case",
    "a slow pion is captured in an atomic orbital around the deuteron and cascades down until it reaches an @xmath62 orbital .",
    "its wave function then has a finite overlap with the deuteron allowing for the pion absorption and the subsequent breakup into two neutrons and a photon to occur .",
    "this process has the advantage that the third final state particle is an easily measured high - energy ( @xmath63  mev ) photon , which has weak final state interaction with the two neutrons .",
    "since the shape of the spectrum is less sensitive to systematic errors than the absolute capture rate , the extraction is in this case always done by fitting the shape of theoretical calculations , with varying @xmath33 , to the data .",
    "the fact that the pion is captured at rest in an atomic orbital around the deuteron has the further theoretical advantage that only the first ( @xmath64 ) of the chew - goldberger - low - nambu ( cgln ) amplitudes  @xcite can contribute , since the pion momentum is negligible on the nuclear scale .",
    "this amplitude corresponds to zero - momentum pions interacting with the proton ( or @xmath65 at threshold ) .      in order to obtain @xmath33 from @xmath35 ,",
    "two different theoretical approaches have been used , both employing single - nucleon dynamics",
    "( impulse approximation ) .",
    "neither attempted a full treatment of two - nucleon effects , though some steps were taken in both approaches to at least estimate their influence .",
    "the first ( phenomenological ) method is exemplified and dominated by the thorough calculations of gibbs , gibson , and stephenson ( ggs )  @xcite . in their results , the one - body amplitude ( the kroll - ruderman term )",
    "is calculated with first order relativistic corrections .",
    "the neutron - neutron wave function was obtained by starting from the asymptotic state and then integrating in from large @xmath66 using the reid soft - core potential  @xcite . inside of @xmath67  fm a fifth degree polynomial with",
    "appropriate matching and boundary conditions was used .",
    "the theoretical error was estimated after an extensive study of the influence of many sources . for small relative momenta ( @xmath68  mev or an @xmath10 opening angle @xmath69 ) the error",
    "is dominated by the uncertainties in the short - range part of the neutron - neutron wave function .",
    "this was estimated by changing the shape of the @xmath10 wave function below 1.4  fm and resulted in an error of @xmath70  fm in @xmath33 .",
    "this small error depends crucially on the small relative energy , , the applicability of these calculations is restricted to the fsi region only .    in the second calculation method",
    "the neutron fsi was analyzed in terms of muskhelishvili - omns dispersion relations .",
    "this work was done by de tramond , gabioud and collaborators  @xcite . in their second paper , they included pion rescattering terms and off - shell effects .",
    "this allowed them to show that these subtleties have importance for large ( @xmath71  mev ) relative @xmath10 momenta .",
    "the final paper of de  tramond and gabioud included higher partial waves and showed that they contributed very little to the extracted @xmath33 , thereby confirming the validity of the approximations made in many of the previous calculations .",
    "the total theoretical error in these calculations is estimated to be @xmath72  fm .    while these theoretical error bars are quite impressive , there are still some aspects that need improvement . in both cases only part of the measured spectrum ( the fsi peak )",
    "is used in the analysis , which raises some concerns regarding the fitting procedure . by fitting only half the spectrum , we loose not only statistical precision but also any additional information in the quasi - free peak .",
    "also it is somewhat questionable if by taking advantage of modern development of effective field theory it should be possible to do a systematic calculation , where all uncertainties can be adequately described in a consistent manner within the same theoretical framework . that it is indeed possible to perform a calculation that successively addresses all these issues",

    "the advantage of this approach is manifold : hb@xmath41pt has strong connections to the underlying theory of the strong interaction ( qcd ) ; in particular it inherits the chiral symmetry of the light quarks .",
    "being an eft , it provides a hierarchal structure of the entire calculation , a so - called power counting , which furnishes the means of successive improvements of the calculation when needed .",
    "the power counting also enables us to make well - defined error estimates .",
    "the drawback of the method , but also its strength , is that at ( almost ) each higher order new coupling parameters , so - called low - energy constants ( lecs ) are introduced .",

    "this follows the ideas originally developed by phillips and cohen  @xcite for the deuteron , which were extended to cover the neutron - neutron state in ref .",
    "the starting point of this approach are the well - known asymptotic states given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the deuteron ( @xmath81 and @xmath83 are the asymptotic @xmath11 and @xmath84 state normalizations ) and @xmath33 and @xmath85 for @xmath10 scattering . then the nucleon - nucleon force ( here of course the chiral @xmath26 one- and two - pion exchange potential  @xcite ) is introduced and the schrdinger equation is used to integrate in from the asymptotic state . at some distance @xmath86 in the few - fermi range , the calculation runs into physics which is not defined in @xmath41pt .",

    "this procedure provides a way to parameterize and regularize our ignorance of short - distance physics . because of",
    "renormalization invariance the end result should be independent of the choice of @xmath86 .",

    "the authors proved it possible to extract @xmath33 with a precision at the @xmath88  fm level if the fit to experimental data is restricted to the fsi peak only .",
    "this error in @xmath33 was due to the uncertainties in the short - range part of the @xmath10 wave function , , there was a small but noticeable @xmath86-dependence .    later this work was significantly improved upon  @xcite , using the realization that at the next higher order ( n3lo ) there is a single counter term , usually labeled @xmath89 , which renormalizes the spin - isospin flip two - body current , i.e. , the gamow - teller ( gt ) transition . this same transition , and hence @xmath89 , plays an important role also in the precise calculations of proton fusion  @xcite , the @xmath90 process  @xcite , neutrino - deuteron breakup reactions  @xcite , tritium beta decay  @xcite , muon capture on the deuteron  @xcite , pion @xmath14-wave production on two nucleons  @xcite , and the corresponding part of the chiral three - nucleon force  @xcite . by normalizing the @xmath35 capture rate to the value of the gt matrix element of @xmath91 ( in turn normalized by phenomenological calculations of tritium beta decay  @xcite ) , it was possible to reduce the error in the extracted @xmath33 to 0.05  fm if fitted in the fsi region , and to 0.3  fm if the entire spectrum is fittedpt recently appeared in the literature  @xcite and should be considered in future chiral extractions of @xmath33 from @xmath92 . ] .",

    "@xcite , only a small fraction of the total phase space is sensitive to @xmath33 , cf .",
    "the very similar kinematics of the @xmath35 reaction .",
    "this means that a measurement of the total capture rate is not sufficient to determine the scattering length ; the @xmath10 energy distribution also needs to be measured .",
    "given the small cross section of neutrino detection , the prospect of using this reaction to extract @xmath33 seems rather slim at the present time .",
    "however , measuring the muon capture on the deuteron has intrinsic value .",
    "it is the simplest weakly interacting nuclear system that can both be measured and calculated to high precision .",
    "it has also been proposed as a tool to extract the pseudo - scalar form factor @xmath94 .",
    "an additional characteristic of this reaction which has more immediate interest is that it goes largely via a gamow - teller transition .",
    "as already mentioned , the two - body current , as defined in the eft framework outlined above , depends on the same lec @xmath89 as does the calculation of @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "it might hence be possible to extract @xmath89 directly from a measurable and calculable two - nucleon process : @xmath93 .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath89 renormalizes not only pion radiative capture , but also @xmath9 fusion  @xcite , neutrino - deuteron breakup  @xcite , tritium beta decay  @xcite the @xmath90 reaction  @xcite , as well as @xmath14-wave pion production on two nucleons  @xcite and part of the chiral three - nucleon force  @xcite . this would put also these other calculations on a more solid footing .",
    "a precise measurement of muon capture would hence indirectly help the extraction of @xmath33 from @xmath35 .",
    "this realization provides part of the motivation for the current effort to measure @xmath93 to 1.5% ( or better ) at psi  @xcite .",
    "this experiment is the latest effort of the very successful muon capture program at psi  @xcite .",
    "it has also motivated a renewed study of the eft calculation of @xmath93  @xcite . in this revised calculation ( an extension ref .",
    "@xcite ) , also the deuteron and @xmath10 wave functions are calculated within the eft framework , using the same integrating - in procedure used in the modern chiral calculation for @xmath35 .",
    "there have been some suggestions in the literature that the @xmath95 could be used to extract @xmath33 .",
    "a superficial inspection seems to suggest that the calculation involved would be very similar to that for the related ( by crossing symmetry ) reaction @xmath35 we just discussed .",
    "however , in this case the pion momentum is non - vanishing and all four cgln amplitudes contribute .",
    "another complication is that , with a pion in flight , constraints on the two - nucleon wave functions ( due to the pauli principle ) are different from the atomic pion absorption case and nucleon rescattering becomes important  @xcite .",
    "the fact that there are now three strongly interacting particles in the final state , raises concerns about the treatment of pion rescattering .",
    "however , with slow enough pions , @xmath41pt tells us that this should be a small effect that is well understood and under control .",
    "reference  @xcite claims a final theoretical error of 0.10  fm in @xmath33 extracted using this method .",
    "this is accomplished through a specific experimental separation of the quasi - free and fsi regions , possible only in carefully chosen angular configurations .",
    "they also pointed out the importance of recoil corrections , which might also play a role in @xmath35 .",
    "this reaction could be measured at the tagged - photon set - up at maxlab in lund , sweden or at the hi@xmath96s facility at tunl once appropriate mirrors have been developed  @xcite .",
    "recently a @xmath97 experiment was carried out at kvi in groningen  @xcite .",
    "the two initial deuterons are transformed , by a gamow - teller transition ( spin and isospin flip ) into a proton pair ( unbound @xmath98 ) and a neutron pair ( @xmath99 ) . by detecting the two protons with low relative energy ( @xmath100  mev )",
    ", one makes certain that they are in a @xmath101 state , i.e. , @xmath98",
    ". then the @xmath10 pair will also be predominantly in the @xmath101 state . in this particular configuration , the measurement of the protons yields a kinematically incomplete description of the @xmath10 system , which can be used to learn more about @xmath33 .",
    "after calculating the reaction using the impulse approximation , ref .",
    "@xcite arrived at an upper bound @xmath102  fm ( 95% cl ) .",
    "this experiment is hence in agreement with the accepted value and the tunl results for @xmath36 breakup but in disagreement with the bonn result",
    ". further work , especially a more sophisticated calculation using three- and four - nucleon dynamics , is necessary for a precise extraction of @xmath33 using this method .",
    "despite the unavailability of dense free - neutron targets , there have been a few suggestions to use direct @xmath10 scattering .",
    "an early suggestion was to use two simultaneous underground nuclear explosions  @xcite .",
    "the intense nucleon flux would be collimated into two colliding beam and the scattering cross section measured .",
    "this would give a precision of about 3% or 0.5 fm in @xmath33 . while a preliminary study was carried out in 1986  @xcite , there are currently no plans to pursue this approach any further",
    ".    it has also been proposed ( a long time ago ) to launch a pulsed nuclear reactor into orbit , with the purpose of eliminating neutron scattering against atmospheric nuclei  @xcite .",
    "however , the estimated uncertainty in @xmath33 is about 10% or @xmath103  fm  @xcite and this suggestion has not been followed up .",
    "another possibility would be to use an intense neutron flux from earth - bound reactors  @xcite . a recent variation of this idea",
    "is pursued by the dianna collaboration using the pulsed reactor yaguar in the former nuclear - weapon city snezhinsk in russia  @xcite . by triggering fusion in a cylindrical reactor containing a uranium salt dissolved in water ,",
    "the emitted neutrons get moderated by plastic walls as they reach the hollow center of the reactor . detecting the resulting neutron spectrum",
    ", one can determine the @xmath10 cross section and thus the scattering length .",
    "the advantages of this set - up are that the neutrino flux is intense , of the order @xmath104 and that the signal ( @xmath10 scattering ) goes as the square of the flux , while the background ( neutron scattering against the surroundings ) is linear in the flux .",
    "this work is still in progress .",
    "during the last few decades the theoretical tools necessary for a precise determination of the neutron - neutron scattering length has seen a remarkable improvement . first , with the modern computers it is possible to do a full faddeev calculation of the three - nucleon system with high - precision phenomenological potentials .",
    "second , the efts provide a systematic and consistent framework for few - body systems , with well - defined theoretical errors .",
    "this has made it possible to put the three- and four - nucleon forces within the same expansion scheme as the nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "also , the @xmath41pt scheme has established connections between various types of reactions , through symmetries and lecs , which in turn makes it possible to calculate seemingly intractable processes .",
    "this makes it possible to constrain the calculations of @xmath35 by the lec @xmath89 extracted from tritium beta decay ( after incorporating it in the eft calculation of the proton fusion process ) and thus help reduce the theoretical error in @xmath33 extracted from the pion capture process .",
    "it is the hope of the author that the measurement of @xmath93 would provide an alternative way to constrain @xmath35 , now directly from a two - body observable .    on the experimental side",
    "the @xmath36 breakup experiments need to converge on a consistent result .",
    "the present situation with two conflicting @xmath33 values is highly unsatisfactory",
    ". a solution might be in sight through the combined effort of both teams , currently being pursued at tunl , where the bonn and tunl experiment are being set up together , using the same beam .",
    "the @xmath35 , which so far has been considered the most promising process , is no longer experimentally accessible , since all pion beam facilities have shut down .",
    "its cousin @xmath95 can be measured at tunl once the appropriate mirrors have been developed and produced .",
    "an alternative would be using the tagged - photon experiment at maxlab .",
    "the most interesting prospect for @xmath33 is the possibility , finally , of a direct measurement at the pulsed reactor yaguar .",
