    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , during which the cosmic gas went from a neutral to an ionized state , is related to many fundamental questions in cosmology , such as the formation and properties of the first stars , the escape of ionizing photons from star - forming regions , and the emergence of the cosmic web .",
    "yet it still remains poorly understood .",
    "currently , this situation is changing through several planned and ongoing experiments .",
    "one of the most promising techniques for studying the eor is the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen . during the eor , the first collapsed objects heated and ionized the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . as a direct probe of the igm ,",
    "the 21 cm line is sensitive to the emergence of the first stellar populations , the radiation from growing massive black holes and the formation of larger groups of galaxies and bright quasars .",
    "simulations of the igm evolution have shown that the redshifted 21 cm signal has a strength of @xmath6 mk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "low - frequency radio experiments such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) , murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , 21 centimeter array ( 21cma ) , giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , precision array to probe epoch of reionization ( paper ) , and square kilometer array ( ska ) will aim to seek detections of the 21 cm signal from the eor in the near future .",
    "unfortunately , the redshifted 21 cm line is swamped by a long list of contaminants .",
    "in addition to the experimental difficulties at low radio frequencies , the presence of galactic and extragalactic foreground sources , which contribute a brightness temperature on the order of @xmath7 k at 100 mhz , does pose a serious challenge for the real - world observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the last decade , a great deal of attention - both observational and theoretical - has been focused on understanding the data components in these low - frequency experiments , in order to prepare us for the upcoming detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "another way to observe the eor is through the cosmic near - infrared background ( nirb ) @xcite .",
    "the first generations of stars and galaxies can produce ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation through nuclear reactions .",
    "these uv photons ( @xmath8  ) at redshifts @xmath9 will be redshifted into the nir band .",
    "such radiation is not expected to be present in the background light at uv and optical bands due to the redshifted lyman limit .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to search for this remnant light in the nir band to study high - redshift galaxies and reionization .",
    "theoretical proposals have motivated experimental measurements both on the integrated intensity and on the anisotropy power spectrum of the nirb . after subtracting foregrounds and point sources",
    ", the sky indeed shows a faint excess emission of extragalactic origin @xcite .",
    "where does the nirb excess come from ? based on current measurements , @xcite suggested that this non - zero excess is unable to be attributed to the known galaxy populations .",
    "a compelling interpretation is that it originates from the many small and faint galaxies at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if true , the nirb would be a powerful probe of the eor since it would probe all sources rather than only the brightest ones .",
    "while there exists debates on the origin of the excess of the cosmic nirb @xcite , one still expects that some contribution to it is from high - redshift sources .",
    "continuing efforts are expended to measure the cosmic 21 cm and nir radiation backgrounds .",
    "it is natural to consider how these two probes can be combined to reveal even more information about the reionization process .",
    "the existence of the 21 cm - nirb cross- correlation comes from the fact that inhomogeneities that lead to spatial fluctuations in the 21 cm and nir backgrounds trace the same underlying density field .",
    "the potential synergy of the cross - correlation study is obvious .",
    "firstly , the 21 cm cross - correlation with nirb will provide a more direct tracer of the interplay between the reionizing sources and the surrounding igm , than their respective auto - correlations . during the eor , the temperature of the igm",
    "would be changed dramatically by photo - ionization , which had a significant impact on further galaxy formation and growth .",
    "since the reionization process depends on the mass and clustering of ionizing sources , measuring the 21 cm - nirb correlation throughout reionization can teach us a great deal about the nature of the first galaxy population . beyond the reionization history , cross - correlation studies can be used to establish the presence of the cosmic nirb radiation from high - redshift sources .",
    "since the nirb at a given frequency consists of the cumulative radiation from all extragalactic sources , the nirb maps do not carry precise redshift information about radiation sources and are not expected to correlate perfectly with each other .",
    "differently , the 21 cm emission comes from a single spectral line , indicating that the associated fluctuations can be well - localized in redshift space .",
    "cross - correlating nirb fields with 21 cm measurements could give a clear signal if the unresolved nirb is dominated by the first galaxies , thus allowing us to make statements about the origin of the detected nirb excess .",
    "cross - correlation also has some useful properties on the data analysis side : it suffers from foregrounds and systematic effects less than auto - correlations .    in this work",
    ", we consider such a combined study .",
    "a rough estimate has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they used a simple analytic model to predict the qualitative features of the cross power spectrum . with the exciting progress made in the study of reionization , detailed theoretical modeling",
    "is now required to forecast the cross - correlation signal , and eventually interpret the results of future observations . here",
    "we introduce a physically motived analytical approach to make firmer statements on how strong the correlation signal could be expected .",
    "we employ a halo model to calculate the non - linear clustering of the density field and make use of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) for the first galaxies .",
    "based on the ongoing star formation model , we further examine energy spectra of various emission processes from early pop ii and pop iii stars . in order to check the consistence of our stellar model and reionization history , we specially estimate the electron - scattering optical depth and compare it to the wmap measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cross - correlation between neutral hydrogen fraction and galaxy density field is taken into account in our calculations , which is significant but neglected in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical investigations offer the best hope of exploring the astrophysical contents of the cross - correlation , although complete simulations will be necessary to understand the entire process more properly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we revisit the angular power spectra of cosmic 21 cm and nir radiation backgrounds and describe the cross - correlation between them .",
    "next , we examine the extent to which the 21 cm - nirb correlation can be detected in section 3 . finally , we conclude with a discussion of our results in section 4 . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a concordance cosmology of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as revealed by the wmap seven - year observations @xcite",
    "in this paper we are interested in measuring the cross - correlation between the cosmic 21 cm and nir radiation backgrounds . for this purpose , here we will describe the power spectra of 21 cm fluctuations and nirb anisotropies , and further derive the cross - correlation between them . since the auto - correlations have been obtained by previous literature ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "the flat - sky coordinates are used throughout the paper .      ignoring peculiar velocities , the 21 cm brightness temperature , relative to the cmb , at observed frequency @xmath17 ( i.e. redshift z ) can be written as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we show the cross - correlation coefficient for various 21 cm redshift slices .",
    "one can see that the absolute value of @xmath184 reaches a maximum of @xmath185 when @xmath186 for the two nir bands considered here .",
    "hence we infer that only a small part of the nirb cross - correlates with the 21 cm emission from the eor .",
    "the result is easy to understand : the nirb contains remnant light of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "specifically , the redshift intervals of the nirb integral are @xmath187 and @xmath188 for h - band and l - band , respectively . however , the bandwidth of 21 cm signal is significantly narrow @xmath189mhz , corresponding to @xmath190 at @xmath191 . in cross - correlation analysis ,",
    "most of the nir light comes from redshifts different from that of the measured 21 cm background .",
    "fortunately , a cross - correlation does exist between these two radiation backgrounds .",
    "any detection of this cross signal in future experiments could tell us properties of early stars and physics of reionization process .",

    "here we consider measurement errors on the expected cross - correlation signal . to get a sense of the precision which we are able to achieve ,",
    "we compute analytic approximations of measurement uncertainties in a simple way that is often accurate enough for theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "first , we show errors on detections of the auto - correlation power spectra of 21 cm and nir backgrounds . then we estimate the associated errors on the determination of their cross - correlation .",
    "we discuss the following experiments in this paper : lofar , ska , ciber - i and ciber - ii .",
    "table 2 lists the instrumental parameter values used for our sensitivity calculation . unless otherwise stated",
    ", the parameters we adopt come from @xcite for lofar and ska , and @xcite and @xcite for ciber - i and ciber - ii .    neglecting systematic effects such as foreground subtraction , errors on a measurement of the 21 cm angular power spectrum @xmath201 at a particular mode @xmath202",
    "can be given by @xcite @xmath203,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the instrumental noise @xmath204 here we take the pixel solid angle to be @xmath205 .",
    "moreover , @xmath206 is the observed fraction of the sky , @xmath192 is the standard deviation for a gaussian beam function in the experiment , and @xmath198 is defined as the rms noise in each pixel @xcite .",
    "the above approximation is formally correct if the 21 cm temperature field is a statistically gaussian distribution .",
    "unfortunately , this condition does not strictly hold .",
    "however , we ignore these and use this relationship here since it allows considerable simplification .    on the nirb side",
    ", the analogous errors can be written as @xcite @xmath207,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath208 accounts for the instrumental noise associated with the nirb measurements .",
    "the errors in measurements of the 21 cm and nirb power spectra with lofar and ciber - i are displayed in the top and bottom panels of figure 3 , respectively .",
    "while it is promising for lofar to detect the angular power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations after an integration time of 1000 hours , a significant detection of the nirb angular power spectrum turns to be difficult due to the limited field of view of ciber - i .",
    "finally we can estimate the associated errors in cross - correlation measurements through @xcite @xmath209^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that here @xmath194 is the fraction of sky observed by both experiments for cross - correlation studies . in figure 6 , we show the expected cross - correlation signal and its measurement variance .",
    "the 21 cm radiation background is measured at @xmath191 with a frequency bin @xmath210 mhz .",
    "we correlate this 21 cm signal against the entire nirb from the eor at h - band ( left ) and l - band ( right ) observations , respectively .",
    "the top panels make it clear that we are unable to extract meaningful information from cross - correlation detections with current telescopes , like lofar and ciber - i .",
    "the errors expected from surveys of a larger covering area seem to be smaller especially at small scales ( bottom panels ) .",
    "it indicates that an experiment with poorer sky coverage will be less precise at every value of @xmath202 , since the limited number of available modes will lead to large sample variance .",
    "for this reason , it is suggested that a cross - correlation experiment should make the covered sky area as large as possible in a fixed observing time in order to reduce the sample variance which dominates measurement errors on large scales .",
    "in addition , we find that the measurement errors still exceed the expected cross - correlation signal at @xmath211 even if @xmath212 .    as we see in figure 7 , the measurement errors could be reduced significantly by increasing the bandwidth ( i.e. frequency resolution ) in 21 cm experiment . here",
    "we show results with @xmath213mhz , which is 100 times larger than that in figure 6 . comparing figure 7 to figure 6",
    ", there is no significant difference in the cross - correlation signal @xmath214 , while the overall level of measurement errors has been reduced obviously . especially for the combined observation with ska and ciber - ii ,",
    "the reduction in @xmath215 is dramatic , greatly expanding the available range of scales .",
    "this is largely due to two reasons : 1 ) the 21 cm power spectrum @xmath201 decreases with the amount of @xmath216 , 2 ) the rms noise @xmath217 in 21 cm measurements is proportional to the factor @xmath218 , and thus increasing the bandwidth @xmath216 decreases @xmath219 . from equation ( 34 ) , one can see that lower levels of @xmath201 and @xmath219 will make smaller errors @xmath215 in cross - correlation detections .",
    "cross - correlation analysis could provide an important complement to the existing reionization studies , yielding new insights into the topology of reionization and eliminating some of the difficulties related to foreground removal . in this paper , we investigated the cross - correlation between the cosmic 21 cm and nir radiation backgrounds , and further quantified the likelihood of measuring this cross power spectrum with future eor experiments .",
    "we adopted a well - studied halo approach to describe the matter distribution during reionization . for first galaxies ,",
    "the halo occupation distribution model was used to examine how these galaxies occupy dark matter halos . just as shown in figure 2 , we considered two stellar populations in the star formation model : metal - free ( pop iii ) stars and metal - poor ( pop ii ) stars . since the uv radiation from high - redshift galaxies is expected to be present in the nir background light , we estimated the nirb intensity for five different emission processes including stellar emission , lyman-@xmath105 line , and free - free , free - bound and two photon emission . collecting all emission from these processes",
    ", we obtained the nir mean emissivity of the stellar nebulae and neglected the same of the igm .",
    "the reionization process was described through the hydrogen ionization fraction as a function of redshift . to test if the reionization history is consistent with the wmap data , we further estimated the optical depth to electron scattering and got @xmath75 .        based on the constructed reionization model",
    ", we explored the cross - correlation signal between the cosmic 21 cm and nir radiation backgrounds during the eor .",
    "since the appropriate theoretical model used to calculate @xmath220 may be not valid on small scales , we will treat more of the physics properly through numerical simulations in the near future . here",
    "we therefore focus on the large - scale behavior of the 21 cm - nirb cross power spectrum . in our fiducial model ,",
    "the 21 cm background is measured at an individual redshift with a frequency bin @xmath221 , and we cumulate the nir background light from the entire epoch of reionization at the observed h - band and l - band .",
    "we found that the 21 cm emission background is positively correlated with the cumulative nirb in the early phases of reionization .",
    "however , by @xmath174 , at which point the mean ionization fraction of neutral hydrogen is @xmath222 , these two radiation backgrounds become anti - correlated on large scales .",
    "furthermore , we study the redshift and scale dependence of the cross - correlation signal .",
    "we showed that the amplitude of the cross power spectrum changes obviously as reionization proceeds , while a similar shape is preserved .",
    "specifically , the overall level of the cross - correlation signal reaches the maximum when the cumulative nirb is correlated with the 21 cm background at redshift @xmath182 with @xmath223 .",
    "the absolute value of the cross power spectrum @xmath224 increases by about 4 orders of magnitude over the scale range @xmath225 .",
    "note that the represented cross power spectrum shows no evidence of a turnover that was claimed to exist in @xcite .",
    "different from cross power spectrum , the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath184 changes slightly with @xmath202 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath184 grows obviously with redshift during the middle and late phases of reionization .",
    "the maximum of @xmath184 appears when @xmath226 , which is only @xmath227 . to a certain extent",
    ", this is induced by the narrow bandwidth of 21 cm measurements @xmath210 mhz . in the discussed scenario ,",
    "most of the nirb radiation is uncorrelated with the redshifted 21 cm line emission and acts as a source of noise .",
    "different from our results , @xcite found a quite strong cross - correlation between these two radiation backgrounds .",
    "this is mainly because the redshift intervals of their 21 cm maps are much larger than ours .",
    "their simulations showed a positive correlation at very early times and an anti - correlation at the mid and late reionization times .",
    "the anti - correlation is the strongest when the universe is @xmath228 ionized or more .",
    "they drew some qualitative conclusions agree with the results obtained in our work .",
    "in addition , we computed an analytic approximation of measurement uncertainties for several upcoming experiments .",
    "the accuracy with which the cross power spectrum can be measured directly depends on the sampling variance .",
    "the greatest problem comes from the nir observation : the early experiments like ciber - i are limited by a very small fraction of the sky being observed .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , a significant detection of the 21 cm - nirb cross power spectrum may be achieved by combing ska and ciber - ii surveys , provided that the integration time independently adds up to 1000 and 1 hours for 21 cm and nir observations , and that the sky coverage fraction of ciber survey is extended from @xmath5 to 0.1 .",
    "surveys required for cross - correlation measurements are clearly very challenging for current telescopes , but rapid progress is being made in this direction as deep , widefield surveys are being designed to study the high - redshift universe .",
    "since the 21 cm and nir radiation backgrounds are non - gaussian , the auto power spectra alone provide an incomplete description of the fields statistical properties .",
    "detection of cross - correlation is therefore quite valuable , which would not only help confirm the exact intensity of the `` missing '' nir background from high - redshift sources but also offer additional information about the reionization process . developing the theoretical analysis of cross - correlation is particularly timely , since it can be used to forecast important constraints and eventually interpret the results of future observations .",
