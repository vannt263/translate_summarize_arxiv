    "the influence of local physical conditions on how efficiently gas forms stars plays a key role shaping galaxies morphologically , kinematically , and chemically .",
    "this has prompted many studies of both the milky way and other galaxies aimed at linking the gas abundance and physical properties of the gaseous ism to the observed star formation rate .",
    "such studies provide key information to understand the physical processes governing star formation on small and large scales and serve as input and the essential point of comparison for simulations on galactic or cosmological scales .",
    "many of these studies have focused on the relationship between  mass , traced by co emission , and the recent star formation rate ( sfr ) , often traced using , e.g. , , uv or infrared ( ir ) emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those studies find a basic scaling between the molecular gas traced by co ( typical densities @xmath4@xmath5 and temperatures @xmath6k ) and the sfr .",
    "however , in detail there are important variations of the ratio between sfr and co including more efficient star formation in compact , dense systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more efficient star formation in galaxy centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a dependence on local dynamics @xcite , and large samples revealing global trends with stellar mass and morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the contrast between vigorous starbursts and main sequence galaxies has drawn particular attention @xcite , but all of these studies show that physical conditions within the molecular gas change systematically across the universe and that these changes in turn affect the star formation process .    on scales of individual clouds in the milky way , stars actually form in a small part of a cloud with the highest surface and volume densities ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the distances of other galaxies , this high surface density ( a@xmath7 , @xmath8  m@xmath9  pc@xmath10 ) gas is best picked out by studying transitions like hcn(1 - 0 ) or hco@xmath3(1 - 0 ) . due to their higher dipole moments compared to co ,",
    "these lines have higher critical densities , around @xmath11@xmath12 compared to @xmath4  @xmath12 for co. accounting for radiative trapping lowers the critical density for exciting emission , so that these lines are tracers of gas with effective density @xmath13  @xmath12 .",
    "analogously , observations of higher - j co lines have been used to trace gas at densities intermediate between that traced by low - j co emission and high critical density tracers like hcn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "focusing on studies comparing emission from high critical density tracers such as hcn to signatures of embedded star formation , these have found a roughly linear correlation that spans from milky way cloud cores @xcite to the integrated emission from star forming galaxies and ( u)lirgs @xcite , a range of ten orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "this correlation has been interpreted as entire galaxies and individual dense cloud cores having a fixed sfr per unit dense gas mass , at least on average . in turn",
    ", this suggests that a main variation driving the changes in the overall star formation efficiency of h@xmath14 may be largely the fraction of the gas mass in this dense phase .",
    "these observations prompt two questions : how does the fraction of gas that is dense depend on the host galaxy and local conditions within an individual galaxy ? and is the rate at which stars form from dense gas really constant or does it vary systematically ?",
    "the former quantity , the fraction of dense gas , is related to the observable intensity ratio @xmath15 . the latter quantity , the star formation efficiency of dense gas , is traced by the @xmath16 ratio . work by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the dense gas fraction is higher in starburst galaxies . despite initial indications that the ir - to - hcn ratio was quite constant ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , other recent work , including studies by @xcite and @xcite indicate that this quantity , too , may show important environmental variations ( see also usero et al . ,",
    "accepted ) .",
    "much insight can be gained in these topics from resolved observations of galaxies , especially those that host extreme conditions not readily accessible in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this in mind",
    ", this paper presents new combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) observations of the high effective density transitions hcn(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath3(1 - 0 ) , hnc(1 - 0 ) , and cs(2 - 1 ) and of @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) emission in the antennae galaxies ( ngc4038/4039 ) .",
    "we use these tracers to study dense gas fractions and scaling relations , placing individual regions within this nearest major galaxy merger onto the scaling relations discussed above .",
    "the relationships among the various lines also suggest variations in physical conditions from place to place within the antennae .",
    "the antennae are the nearest major galaxy merger , at a distance of @xmath17  mpc @xcite .",
    "the colliding galaxies exhibit bright co emission @xcite at each of the two nuclei and in the `` overlap '' region where the two systems are colliding .",
    "the collision has led to abundant star formation and numerous young stellar clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the proximity of the galaxies and the extreme environment induced by the galaxy merger make the antennae an ideal target for spatially resolved dense gas observations .",
    "@xcite made a first study of hcn in the antennae using single - dish observations .",
    "these exclude much of the overlap region where most of the star formation takes place , however , and their resolution of 72  is more than a factor of 10 coarser than that of our new carma observations . with improved resolution and a field of view covering the entire system , we are able to study individual regions within the galaxies .",

    "we detect each transition towards both nuclei and the overlap region ( see figure [ fig : carmair ] and table [ table1 ] ) .",

    "second , we measure the luminosities for individual bright regions , the whole overlap region , and our whole map from integrating data cubes masked to contain only significant emission .    in table 1",
    "we report integrated intensities for all lines towards the five lines of sight that show the brightest hcn emission .",
    "these lines of sight correspond to the two galaxy nuclei and three previously known supergiant molecular clouds in the overlap region .",
    "we measure the intensities from the @xmath29 common - resolution data cubes by integrating the line emission , in kelvins , across a velocity window selected by hand to encompass all bright line emission .",
    "typically this line width is about 300kms@xmath23 . for these measurements ,",
    "no additional masking is applied beyond the choice of velocity window . for these integrated intensities , we calculate statistical uncertainties of @xmath33  k  km  s@xmath23 for the 90 ghz lines and @xmath34kkms@xmath23 for @xmath26 .",

    "we produce one three - dimensional mask for the 90 ghz lines and one for co. to do so , we select regions of the cube that have a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 3.5 ( 5 ) for the hcn or hco@xmath1 ( co ) over at lease two adjacent velocity channels . we remove small regions ( those less than a beam size in volume ) because these likely represent statistical fluctuations .",
    "we then apply the mask to the cube and integrate to produce a map of integrated intensity . from these integrated intensity maps",
    ", we measure the flux summed in several different regions : beam - sized , 6.5-diameter apertures centered on the hcn peak positions from table [ table1 ] ; larger circular apertures that encompass the entire northern nucleus , southern nucleus , and overlap region ; and a sum over the whole map .",
    "figure [ fig : carmair ] shows the apertures and table 2 reports the aperture positions and sizes and the luminosities derived from the measured fluxes and our adopted distance .",
    "our interferometer measurements with carma may resolve out emission on large spatial scales and the need to mask may cause us to miss low signal to noise emission . to check how much flux we may miss , we compare our luminosities ( table 2 ) to the single dish measurements presented in @xcite .",
    "accounting for differences in the adopted distance , we recover about 70% and 50% of the total @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) luminosity , respectively , found by @xcite .",
    "note that the @xcite co observations cover the entire system and thus a significantly larger area compared to our map ( see their figure 2 ) ; from earlier work , we know that a significant amount of co emission arises from the northern arm that is not included in our coverage .",
    "the flux in our carma co map is about @xmath38 higher than the integrated result from the earlier ovro ( interferometer ) work by @xcite .",
    "overall , missing flux does not appear to be an enormous concern for the co.    for the hcn , the amount of flux missed is less clear : the discrepancy with the single dish result reflects some combination of calibration uncertainties in both telescopes , statistical noise in the @xcite measurement , the limited coverage of our map , and flux missed due to the need to clip the data based on signal - to - noise .",
    "there is not a strong reason to expect the 90  ghz lines to be more spatially filtered than co ; they were observed with the same two carma configurations and to first order the structure of the galaxy should be similar in these two tracers of the molecular gas .",
    "the @xcite luminosity is computed from two pointings , one of which would include the northern arm not covered in our observations .",
    "those measurements also have comparatively low signal to noise , as do our own data .",
    "for the most part the faint thermal radio continuum at 90  ghz remains undetected .",
    "however , the hcn and hco@xmath3 spectra in region i d 3 do show some hints of thermal continuum emission , though at low - significance .",
    "we remove this component during data processing .",
    "our observations cover both nuclei and the overlap region and following @xcite we detect abundant molecular gas across the galaxies , with concentrations at both nuclei and a large mass of molecular gas in the overlap region .",

    "we can also attempt to recast the observed ir , co , and hcn emission into more physical quantities with the caveat that such conversions come with substantial uncertainty . to estimate approximate physical values for the total and dense molecular gas mass and star formation rate , we adopt @xmath40 @xcite , a galactic @xmath41  m@xmath42  ( k  km  s@xmath23  pc@xmath43)@xmath23 , and the tir - to - star formation rate conversion of @xcite .",

    "we also caution that these ratios , in particular between alma and carma data , come with caveats due to different @xmath54 coverage and because they arise from interferometer - only data ( see discussion in section 2 ) . nonetheless some basic results are clear , with all measurements showing broadly similar line ratio patterns .",
    "co emission ( in k ) declines from ( 1 - 0 ) to ( 2 - 1 ) to ( 3 - 2 ) .",
    "the four high critical density tracers , hcn ( 1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath3 ( 2 - 1 ) , cs ( 2 - 1 ) , and hnc ( 1 - 0 ) are all fainter , by more than an order of magnitude compared to co ( 1 - 0 ) with the ordering usually hco@xmath3 ( 1 - 0 ) @xmath55 hcn ( 1 - 0 ) @xmath55 cs ( 1 - 0 ) @xmath55 hnc ( 1 - 0 ) .    our observed co(3 - 2)/(1 - 0 ) ratio of @xmath56 and co(2 - 1)/(1 - 0 ) ratio of @xmath57 could be reproduced ( within @xmath58 ) either by cool , dense gas , in which the source function does not match the rayleigh - jeans approximation even at 230 and 345 ghz .",
    "alternatively , they could be produced from hotter gas that has low enough density to sub - thermally excite the lines . with only the low-@xmath30 @xmath0co lines , these scenarios can not be readily distinguished and a covariant set of densities and temperatures can reasonably reproduce our observed values in a one - zone model like radex @xcite .",
    "in fact , a combination of multiple physical conditions within the beam is almost certain ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for more discussion ) .",
    "indeed this would be required to simultaneously model both our high critical density lines and the co emission ; however , with only a single line per high - dipole species , this modeling introduces a free parameter ( the abundance ) for each new observation and does not yield significant insight .    as discussed above ,",
    "the co line ratios should be treated with some caution because the data come from different telescopes with different @xmath54 coverage .",
    "indeed , the co(3 - 2 ) / ( 1 - 0 ) ratio found here is much lower than that reported from single dish data by @xcite .",
    "they found ratios near unity in the nuclei and varying with star formation activity level across the overlap region .",
    "different spatial filtering or calibration differences between carma and alma might account for some of the discrepancy .",
    "the required sense is that the alma data recover a smaller fraction of the true co flux than carma .",
    "although alma is the more sensitive telescope and higher-@xmath30 co emission might be more clumpy , the spatial filtering from alma is more severe .",
    "some differential spatial filtering is certainly to be expected ; the minimum projected baseline length for carma is @xmath59 while for alma it is @xmath60 for co ( 2 - 1 ) and @xmath61 for co ( 3 - 2 ) .",
    "these correspond to maximum recoverable spatial scales of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for co ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) , and ( 3 - 2 ) , respectively .",
    "however , spatial filtering occurs only in a single velocity channel and figure [ fig : carmair ] shows that the co ( 1 - 0 ) and ir emission are already clumpy and concentrated towards the compact nuclei and the sgmcs , so we do not expect this effect to be severe . indeed , after carefully matching @xmath54 coverage between sma and ovro data , @xcite also find co(3 - 2)/(1 - 0 ) ratios significantly less than reported by @xcite .",
    "they find co ( 3 - 2 ) / co ( 1 - 0 ) ratios of 0.30.6 for essentially the same five regions considered here ; we find @xmath56 .",
    "though clearly uncertain , our analysis supports the results of @xcite and argues that the bulk of the gas in the antennae is either cool or sub - thermally excited .",
    "the ratios among the high effective density molecules are less systematically uncertain because they all come from one set of carma observations .",
    "these show that although we have discussed hcn ( 1 - 0 ) for ease of comparison to the literature , the hco@xmath1 ( 1 - 0 ) line is in fact brighter than hcn ( 1 - 0 ) across the antennae . in this regard ,",
    "the overlap region resembles m82 @xcite but is weaker in hcn than is typical in the larger ( @xmath65 ) sample of fir - luminous galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "compared to the @xcite sample , the antennae have a typical hco@xmath1/co(1 - 0 ) ratio of 0.06 but the antennae ratios of hcn / co(1 - 0 ) @xmath66 and hnc / co(1 - 0 ) @xmath67 are lower than average .",
    "the typical values of these ratios from @xcite are @xmath180.06 and @xmath180.04 ( excluding their upper limits ) .",
    "if the abundances of hco@xmath1 and hcn are taken to be the same throughout the antennae and the @xcite sample , the easiest interpretation of the stronger hco@xmath1 emission is that the dense gas in the antennae is less dense , on average , than in a typical fir - luminous galaxy , where hcn ( 1 - 0 ) @xmath18 hco@xmath1 ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "alternatively , differences in optical depth , which change the effective density at which the gas emits , might interact with the distribution of densities to produce stronger hco@xmath1 emission .",
    "though without a functional form for the density distribution , the sense of optical depth effects is hard to quantify . including abundance variations , there is an extensive literature on the drivers of the hco@xmath1-to - hcn line ratio @xcite . though these differ in detail , the overall sense is that hcn emission may be enhanced relative to hco@xmath3 in the most active systems .",
    "for example , the abundance of hco@xmath3 may be additionally suppressed by recombination at high densities @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the observation of strong hco@xmath1 relative to hcn in the antennae galaxies makes sense ; the antennae are extended and have low sfr - to - co compared to more active systems ( see above and * ? ? ? * ) . indeed , the brightest hcn emission comes from the compact , active northern nucleus , where the two lines have about the same intensity .",
    "so this trend may play out within the antennae as well as between the antennae and other systems .",
    "we report new carma observations of a suite of molecular lines in the antennae galaxies , including the high effective density transitions hcn(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , cs(2 - 1 ) , and hnc(1 - 0 ) and the bulk molecular gas tracer @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "we combine these with _ herschel _ infrared observations and alma science verification observations of @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath0co(3 - 2 ) to report on conditions within the molecular gas and the apparent relationship between dense molecular gas , the total amount of molecular gas , and embedded star formation traced by infrared emission .",
    "we find substantial variations in the observed ratios ir / co , ir / hcn , and hcn / co across the galaxy .",
    "these variations have magnitude comparable to the scatter seen over the whole galaxy population .",
    "these measurements agree with other recent studies and highlight either substantial evolutionary effects or systematic differences in the local physical conditions in the molecular gas and its link to star formation . comparing different molecular transitions , we find hco@xmath1 ( 1 - 0 ) to be almost twice as strong as hcn ( 1 - 0 ) in the overlap region , perhaps indicative of a large amount of intermediate density gas .",
