    "it was previously introduced in two contexts :    * _ the statistics of return times into small neighborhoods_. it was shown in @xcite , that for certain weakly hyperbolic maps @xmath12 grows linearly with @xmath7 when the metric entropy of @xmath13 is positive . for systems with good mixing properties , this allows to ignore the contribution of those points which come back early , the other points giving an asymptotic distribution of exponential type @xmath14 . * _ the recurrence ( or afraimovich - pesin ) dimension_. in @xcite , the quantity @xmath15 was used as a set function in the caratheodory covering of a given space , thus providing a parametrized family of borel measures with transition point ( dimension ) located at some dynamical characteristic of the space ( usually the topological entropy ) .    especially motivated by the first item , we proved a general result on _ any _ measurable dynamical systems with positive entropy @xmath16 .",
    "in @xcite we showed    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if the partition @xmath2 is finite or countable and the entropy @xmath17 is strictly positive , then @xmath18 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    under the additional assumption that @xmath0 is invertible the two sided case @xmath19 was proven in @xcite . here @xmath20 . in both cases equality",
    "holds if we assume the specification property .    in @xcite , we proposed a new technique to compute the lyapunov exponent for a large class of weakly hyperbolic maps of the interval .",
    "the method expressed the exponent in terms of local recurrence properties .",
    "this is one result in the spirit of what was recently called `` the thermodynamics of return times '' : reformulating the statistical properties of dynamical systems in terms of returns of points or sets in the neighborhood of ( or into ) themselves .    comparing cylinders with balls naturally relates @xmath21 with the growth ( in the expanding case ) of the derivative @xmath22 around the center @xmath6 and has two immediate consequences : it allows to compare a ball of radius @xmath5 with a cylinder of order @xmath23 and to compare @xmath5 with ( some ) lyapunov exponents @xmath24 of the map _ via _ the identification : @xmath25-bounded variation with an invariant measures with positive entropy . for this class we approximated a cylinder from the inside with a ball ,",
    "used the monotonicity of the set function @xmath26 and invoked ( [ complexity0 ] ) to show that : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the positive lyapunov exponent of the measure @xmath13 of positive metric entropy . when the map satisfies the specification property the existence of the limit in ( [ complexity0 ] ) implies the existence of the limit in ( [ formula ] ) , and its equality with the inverse of the lyapunov exponent .    in this paper",
    "we generalize formula ( [ formula ] ) for multidimensional transformations , providing examples which show that our inequalities are sharp and other examples where strict inequalities hold .",
    "we will work with @xmath29 diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold @xmath3 endowed with an invariant ergodic measure @xmath13 of positive metric entropy or invertible maps which are locally @xmath29 diffeomorphisms with reasonable singularity sets such as in the monograph  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath30 be the lyapunov exponents of the measure @xmath13 .",
    "in this very general setting , we will prove that the left hand side in ( [ formula ] ) will be bounded from below by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) is the largest @xmath34 ( resp .",
    "smallest @xmath35 ) lyapunov exponent .",
    "the technique of the proof will consists in using ( [ complexity ] ) together with a comparison of balls and cylinders in local lyapunov charts . in order to get an upper bound for @xmath36",
    ", one needs the additional properties that the measure is hyperbolic ( all the lyapunov exponents are non - zero ) and what we call a `` nonuniform specification property '' which will insure the existence of periodic points , of a well specified period , following closely the orbit of any other point @xmath6 in a big set up to a certain time @xmath7 ( see the next section for the precise definition ) . using this assumption we will compare balls not with cylinders , but with bowen ( dynamical ) balls , which will contain periodic points and which will return therefore into themselves with a controlled time . in this case",
    "we will get an upper bound of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the smallest positive lyapunov exponent and @xmath39 is the largest negative lyapunov exponent .",
    "these bounds become particularly easy , and more accessible , for two - dimensional compact hyperbolic sets ( or more generally for two - dimensional invariant sets enjoying the non - uniform specification property quoted above ) : in these cases the limit exists and gives the difference of the inverses of the positive and negative lyapunov exponents .",
    "we point out that the product of this difference with the metric entropy gives the hausdorff dimension of the measure @xmath13 ( young s formula ) .",
    "furthermore if the map has a constant jacobian , the knowledge of one lyapunov exponent will immediately gives the other .",
    "the numerical computation of the quantity @xmath40 seems very efficient and reliable when applied to plane attractors and conformal repellers ; the detailed numerical analysis will be published elsewhere .    in the last section we provide several examples .",
    "first we provide examples where the limit of @xmath40 exists and equals the bounds of theorem [ thm1 ] showing that each of the inequalities is optimal .",
    "furthermore we provide an example where both inequalities are strict . in this example",
    "the limit equals a mixture of the @xmath41 .    as a byproduct of these results on return times",
    "we obtain some information on the spectrum of poincar recurrence of an invariant measure introduced in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the quantity @xmath42 constitutes one of the component of the pointwise dimension associated to the caratheodory structure attached to the recurrence dimension .",
    "see section  [ ap ] for details .",
    "throughout the article we suppose that @xmath3 is an @xmath7dimensional riemannian manifold and @xmath43 a @xmath29 diffeomorphism . a @xmath0invariant measure @xmath13 is called _ hyperbolic _ if all its lyapunov exponents are non - null and _ partially hyperbolic _ if at least one of its positive lyapunov exponents and at least one of its negative lyapunov exponents are non - null .",
