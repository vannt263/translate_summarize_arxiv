    "triggered by active investigations on error correcting codes in both of information theory ( it )  @xcite and statistical physics ( sp )  @xcite communities , there is a growing interest in the relationship between it and sp .",
    "as the two communities investigate similar problems , one may expect that standard techniques known in one framework would bring about new developments in the other , and vice versa . here",
    "we present a direct sp method to determine the critical noise level for gallager type low density parity check codes which allows us to focus on the differences between the various decoding criteria and their approach for defining the critical noise level for which decoding , using low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes , is theoretically feasible .",
    "in a general scenario , the @xmath2 dimensional boolean message @xmath3 is encoded to the @xmath4 dimensional boolean vector @xmath5 , and transmitted via a noisy channel , which is taken here to be a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) characterized by an independent flip probability @xmath6 per bit ; other transmission channels may also be examined within a similar framework . at the other end of the channel ,",
    "the corrupted codeword is decoded utilizing the structured codeword redundancy .",
    "the error correcting code that we focus on here is gallager s linear code  @xcite .",
    "gallager s code is a low density parity check code defined by the a binary @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 $ ] , concatenating two very sparse matrices known to both sender and receiver , with the @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 being invertible .",
    "the matrix @xmath11 has @xmath12 non - zero elements per row and @xmath13 per column , and the code rate is given by @xmath14 .",
    "encoding refers to multiplying the original message @xmath15 with the @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 $ ] ) , yielding the transmitted vector @xmath19 .",
    "note that all operations are carried out in ( mod 2 ) arithmetic . upon sending @xmath20 through the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) with noise level @xmath6 ,",
    "the vector @xmath21 is received , where @xmath22 is the true noise .",
    "decoding is carried out by multiplying @xmath23 by @xmath11 to produce the syndrome vector @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , since @xmath26 ) . in order to reconstruct the original message @xmath15",
    ", one has to obtain an estimate @xmath27 for the true noise @xmath22 .",
    "first we select all @xmath27 that satisfy the parity checks @xmath28 : @xmath29 the ( restricted ) parity check set . any general decoding scheme",
    "then consists of selecting a vector @xmath30 from @xmath31 on the basis of some noise statistics criterion . upon successful decoding",
    "@xmath32 will be selected , while a decoding error is declared when a vector @xmath33 is selected .",
    "an measure for the error probability is usually defined in the information theory literature  @xcite as p_e(p)= (  ^r_pc(,^o ) : w()w(^o )  |  ^o )  _ , ^o  , [ pe ] where @xmath34 is an indicator function returning 1 if there exists a vector @xmath35 with lower weight than that of the given noise vector @xmath22 .",
    "the weight of a vector is the average sum of its components @xmath36 . to obtain the error probability , one averages the indicator function over all @xmath22 vectors drawn from some distribution and the code ensemble @xmath11 as denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "carrying out averages over the indicator function is difficult , and the error probability ( [ pe ] ) is therefore upper - bounded by averaging over the _ number _ of vectors @xmath38 obeying the weight condition @xmath39 .",
    "alternatively , one can find the average number of vectors with a given weight value @xmath40 from which one can construct a complete weight distribution of noise vectors @xmath38 in @xmath41 .",
    "from this distribution one can , in principle , calculate a bound for @xmath42 and derive critical noise values above which successful decoding can not be carried out .    a natural and direct measure for the average number of states is the entropy of a system under the restrictions described above , that can be calculated via the methods of statistical physics .",
    "it was previously shown ( see e.g. @xcite for technical details ) that this problem can be cast into a statistical mechanics formulation , by replacing the field @xmath43 by ( @xmath44 ) , and by adapting the parity checks correspondingly .",
    "the statistics of a noise vector @xmath27 is now described by its magnetization @xmath45 , @xmath46)$ ] , which is inversely linked to the vector weight in the @xmath47 $ ] representation . with this in mind , we introduce the conditioned magnetization enumerator , for a given code and noise , measuring the noise vector magnetization distribution in @xmath48 _ , ^o(m )  . [ man ] to obtain the _ magnetization enumerator _",
    "@xmath49 ( m)=  _ , ^o(m )  _ , ^o  , [ m ] which is the entropy of the noise vectors in @xmath50 with a given @xmath51 , one carries out uniform explicit averages over all codes @xmath11 with given parameters @xmath52 , and weighted average over all possible noise vectors generated by the bsc , i.e. , p(^o)=_j=1^m((1p )  ( n^o_j1)+p  ( n^o_j1 ) ) .",
    "it is important to note that , in calculating the entropy , the average quantity of interest is the magnetization enumerator rather than the actual number of states . for physicists ,",
    "this is the natural way to carry out the averages due to three main reasons : a ) the entropy obtained in this way is believed to be _ self - averaging _ ,",
    "i.e. , its average value ( over the disorder ) coincides with its _ typical _ value .",
    "b ) this quantity is _ extensive _ and grows linearly with the system size .",
    "c ) this averaging distinguishes between _ annealed _ variables that are averaged or summed for a given set of _ quenched _ variables , that are averaged over later on . in this particular case ,",
    "summation over all @xmath38 vectors is carried for a _ fixed _ choice of code @xmath11 and noise vector @xmath53 ; averages over these variables are carried out at the next level .",
    "one should point out that in somewhat similar calculations , we showed that this method of carrying out the averages provides more accurate results in comparison to averaging over both sets of variables simultaneously  @xcite .    a positive magnetization enumerator",
    ", @xmath54 indicates that there is an exponential number of solutions ( in @xmath55 ) with magnetization @xmath51 , for typically chosen @xmath11 and @xmath53 , while @xmath56 indicates that this number vanishes as @xmath57 ( note that negative entropy is unphysical in discrete systems ) .    another important indicator for successful",
    "decoding is the overlap @xmath58 between the selected estimate @xmath30 , and the true noise @xmath22 :  @xmath59 , @xmath60)$ ] , with @xmath61 for successful ( perfect ) decoding .",
    "however , this quantity can not be used for decoding as @xmath22 is unknown to the receiver .",
    "the ( code and noise dependent ) overlap enumerator is now defined as : _ , ^o ( )  , and the average quantity being ( ) = _ , ^o()_,^o  .",
    "this measure is directly linked to the _ weight enumerator _",
    "@xcite ) , although according to our notation , averages are carried out distinguishing between annealed and quenched variables unlike the common definition in the it literature . however , as we will show below , the two types of averages provide identical results _ in this particular case_.",
    "quantities of the type @xmath62 , with @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 , are very common in the sp of disordered systems ; the macroscopic order parameter @xmath65 is fixed to a specific value and may depend both on the disorder @xmath66 and on the microscopic variables @xmath67 . although we will not prove this here , such a quantity is generally believed to be _ self - averaging _ in the large system limit , i.e. , obeying a probability distribution @xmath68 .",
    "the direct calculation of @xmath69 is known as a _ quenched _ average over the disorder , but is typically hard to carry out and requires using the replica method  @xcite .",
    "the replica method makes use of the identity @xmath70/n\\ \\ket$ ] , by calculating averages over a product of partition function replicas . employing assumptions about replica symmetries and analytically continuing the variable @xmath71 to zero",
    ", one obtains solutions which enable one to determine the state of the system .    to simplify the calculation , one often employs the so - called _ annealed _ approximation , which consists of performing an average over @xmath72 first , followed by the logarithm operation .",
    "this avoids the replica method and provides ( through the convexity of the logarithm function ) an upper bound to the quenched quantity : q_a(c )   q_q(c)_y=_n0 _ y^n(c)_y1 nm  . [ qaq ]",
    "the full technical details of the calculation will be presented elsewhere , and those of a very similar calculation can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "it turns out that it is useful to perform the gauge transformation @xmath73 , such that the averages over the code @xmath74 and noise @xmath22 can be separated , @xmath75 becomes independent of @xmath22 , leading to an equality between the quenched and annealed results , @xmath76 . for any finite noise value @xmath6 one should multiply @xmath77 $ ] by the probability that a state obeys all parity checks @xmath78 $ ] given an overlap @xmath58 and a noise level @xmath6  @xcite . in calculating @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the @xmath81-functions fixing @xmath51 and @xmath58 ,",
    "are enforced by introducing lagrange multipliers @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "carrying out the averages explicitly one then employs the saddle point method to extremize the averaged quantity with respect to the parameters introduced while carrying out the calculation .",
    "these lead , in both quenched and annealed calculations , to a set of saddle point equations that are solved either analytically or numerically to obtain the final expression for the averaged quantity ( entropy ) .",
    "the final expressions for the annealed entropy , under both overlap ( @xmath58 ) and magnetization ( @xmath51 ) constraints , are of the form : _ a&=&-ck((2)(k1)(1q_1^k))_n=1e^(nn^o)(1nq_1^k1)^c_n^o + & & - - m  , [ qa ] where @xmath84 has to be obtained from the saddle point equation @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , the final expression in the quenched calculation , employing the simplest replica symmetry assumption  @xcite , is of the form : _",

    "to summarize , we have shown that the _ magnetization enumerator _ @xmath49 plays a central role in determining the achievable critical noise level for various decoding schemes . the formalism based on the magnetization enumerator @xmath0 offers a intuitively simple alternative to the weight enumerator formalism as used in typical pairs decoding @xcite , but requires invoking the replica method given the very low critical values obtained by the annealed approximation calculation .",
