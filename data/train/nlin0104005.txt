    "natural hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom have hamiltonian functions of the form @xmath0 in spite of the simple appearance , those hamiltonian functions having appropriately chosen potential functions are used in a wide variety of physical sciences such as plasma physics , condensed matter physics , and celestial mechanics .",
    "however , the potential functions describe nonlinear interactions , in general , so that chaotic or highly unstable trajectories take place in respective phase spaces , as is widely recognized .",
    "the exponential instability of trajectories are measured in terms of lyapunov exponents , which describe time - averaged properties of chaotic trajectories .",
    "further , in the study of directional deviations of chaotic trajectories , lyapunov vectors will be of great use .",
    "the lyapunov exponents and the lyapunov vectors are defined through linearized hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : natural - hamiltonian ] ) , the linearized equations take the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a @xmath3-dimensional vector representing a deviation from a reference trajectory @xmath4 to a nearby trajectory .",
    "the linearized equations ( [ eq : linearized - hamilton - eq ] ) have @xmath3 linearly independent solutions , which we denote by @xmath5 .",
    "the lyapunov vectors @xmath6 are then obtained by orthogonalizing these solutions on the gram - schmidt method : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the inner product of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11-th lyapunov exponent @xmath12 is calculated as @xmath13 it is to be noted that the values of the lyapunov exponents are known to be independent of the choice of initial values of the lyapunov vectors except for vanishing lebesgue measure @xcite , and that the exponents are ordered as @xmath14 .",
    "since the lyapunov exponents are time - averaged quantities , they are suitable for the study of statistic properties of hamiltonian systems . for example , phase transitions are investigated by the use of lyapunov exponents .",
    "in fact , the second - order phase transition @xcite and the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite are characterized by the discontinuity in the largest lyapunov exponents and by a sudden change in the gradient of the largest lyapunov exponent against energy , respectively .",
    "further , the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents , which is also viewed as a function of energy , is used in the discussion of a dynamical phase transition @xcite , according to which trajectory s phase transition from nearly - integrable behavior to chaotic behavior occurs in an energy region in which the sum of positive exponents breaks into a rapid increase against energy .",
    "in contrast with this , the lyapunov vectors are expected to be useful in studying dynamical behavior of chaotic trajectories , since they serve as time series @xcite .",
    "suppose that a reference trajectory is given in a phase space .",
    "then , according to ( [ eq : lyapunov - vectors ] ) , one can form @xmath3 linearly independent lyapunov vectors from solutions to the linearized equations of motion along the reference trajectory .",
    "however , two of the lyapunov vectors which are associated with lyapunov exponents , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are considered as marginal , since @xmath15 and @xmath16 should vanish , as is widely recognized .",
    "one of those two lyapunov vectors is the tangent vector to the trajectory , @xmath17 , and the other the gradient vector of hamiltonian function , @xmath18 .",
    "we may interpret these vectors as follows : the displacement in the direction @xmath17 is regarded just as a certain time displacement in the reference trajectory , and the displacement in the direction @xmath18 will give rise to a transfer to a nearby trajectory with an energy value different from that of the reference trajectory . in view of this , in order to analyze the instability of trajectories , we are allowed to require that the two directions pointed by the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 be separated out from the other @xmath19 directions .",
    "put another way , the requirement means that a lyapunov vector which is orthogonal to the plane spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 at an initial instant has to be orthogonal to the plane spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 at every instant . if the requirement is fulfilled , we will be able to discuss the instability of trajectories without influence of the two marginal directions .",
    "unfortunately , the usual method of lyapunov analysis on the basis of the equations ( [ eq : linearized - hamilton - eq ] ) does not satisfy the requirement in general .",
    "this is because for any solution @xmath20 to ( [ eq : linearized - hamilton - eq ] ) one has @xmath21 so that one obtains @xmath22 at any instant if @xmath23 at an initial instant , but , in general , by no means one can make @xmath24 vanish at any instant , so that even the first lyapunov vector , @xmath25 , can not be made orthogonal to the plane spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 at every instant .",
    "a way to construct lyapunov vectors which satisfy the above - stated requirement is to adopt linearized equations of different type from the usual one ( [ eq : linearized - hamilton - eq ] ) . to take a geometric approach",
    "to hamilton s equations of motion is a step toward finding such lyapunov vectors . as for the geometric approach , it is known that if the total energy of the natural dynamical system is fixed at @xmath26 , newton s equations of motion can be equivalently expressed as geodesic equations on a riemannian manifold @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a subspace of the configuration space @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the jacobi metric defined by @xmath32",
    ". then the linearized equations of the geodesic equations are given by the jacobi equations of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the components of the riemann curvature tensor , and @xmath35 is the arc length defined as @xmath36 on the other hand , the linearized newton s equations are put in the form @xmath37 equations ( [ eq : jacobi - eq ] ) and ( [ eq : linearized - newton - eq ] ) are not transformed to each other through the parameter transformation ( [ eq : arc - length - s ] ) , while newton s equations of motion and geodesic equations for the jacobi metric are transformed to each other .",
    "this geometric method has been introduced in the estimation of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath38 with the aid of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "they studied instability of geodesics through the jacobi equation , a second - order differential equation , while the lyapunov analysis needs first - order differential equations .",
    "the geometric approach we will take in this article is to be made on the cotangent bundle @xmath39 of the riemannian manifold @xmath28 in order to find first - order differential equations associated with ( [ eq : jacobi - eq ] ) and thereby to construct lyapunov vectors which satisfy the above - stated requirements .",
    "we will first work with generic linearized hamilton s equations of motion on @xmath39 , and then specialize the resultant equations to linearized hamilton s equations for geodesic flows on @xmath39 , which will be found to project to the jacobi equations on @xmath28 .",
    "further , we will introduce a lifted metric on the cotangent bundle @xmath39 to make it possible to discuss the orthogonality of vector fields on @xmath39 .",
    "the lifted metric may be called the sasaki metric . on this setting",
    ", we will be able to find lyapunov vectors satisfying the above - stated requirements along any geodesic flow on @xmath39 .",
    "put in detail , it will be shown that along any geodesic flow on @xmath39 , there exist lyapunov vectors such that those associated with the vanishing lyapunov exponents @xmath40 and @xmath16 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , and the other @xmath19 lyapunov vectors are all orthogonal to the plane spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 at each point of the geodesic flow .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section [ sec : geometry ] contains a brief review of geodesics and jacobi fields and , in particular , of the jacobi metric , whose geodesics are equivalent to trajectories of the natural dynamical system with a fixed total energy . in sec.[sec : geometry ] and succeeding sections , einstein s summation convention is adopted , and we choose to denote by @xmath41 local coordinates on a general @xmath42-dimensional riemannian manifold , and by @xmath43 the cartesian coordinates on @xmath29 . section [ sec : cotangent - bundle ] is concerned with geodesic flows on the cotangent bundle @xmath39 , which project to geodesics on @xmath28 . to describe geodesic flows in a more geometric way",

    "section [ sec : calculation ] is for numerical calculations for a model system with three degrees of freedom .",
    "lyapunov vectors and lyapunov exponents are calculated numerically for the model system in both geometric and usual methods to compare the respective results .",
    "it will be shown that lyapunov exponents calculated in respective methods coincide with each other , independently of the choice of methods .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "appendices are attached in which related topics on geometry of cotangent bundles and a symplectic implicit runge - kutta method for numerical integration are reviewed .",
    "in particular , lifting vector fields on @xmath28 to @xmath39 and the levi - civita connection with respect to the lifted metric on @xmath39 are discussed .",
    "let @xmath44 be an @xmath42-dimensional riemannian manifold with metric @xmath45 .",
    "the metric induces the levi - civita connection @xmath46 on @xmath28 ; for vector fields @xmath47 , @xmath48 denoting the set of vector fields on @xmath28 , the covariant derivative @xmath49 is defined , in terms of local coordinates @xmath50 , to be @xmath51 { \\dfrac{\\partial } { \\partial x^{i}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are components of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , the christoffel symbols @xmath56 are defined as @xmath57 with components of the metric @xmath58 for a geodesic @xmath59 with @xmath35 the arc length parameter , the tangent vector @xmath60 to the geodesic satisfies the geodesic equation @xmath61 \\left.{\\dfrac{\\partial } { \\partial x^{i}}}\\right|_{c(s ) }    = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 with @xmath63 we are interested in stability / instability of geodesics . to this end , we consider a congruence of geodesics which looks like a fluid whose flow lines are geodesics with the @xmath59 as a member of them",
    ". then we may consider that the tangent vector @xmath60 to @xmath59 is extended to be a vector field defined in a neighborhood of the original geodesic @xmath59 .",
    "we may also assume that there exists a vector field @xmath54 satisfying the condition @xmath64=0\\ ] ] in the same domain as that for @xmath60 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : commutes ] ) means that a geodesic with @xmath60 its tangent vector is carried congruently to another infinitesimally nearby geodesic by the infinitesimal transformation @xmath54 .",

    "the vector field @xmath60 may have singularity at which @xmath60 is not defined uniquely , and @xmath54 may vanish there . with this in mind , we operate @xmath65 with @xmath66 and use the definition of the riemann curvature tensor and of the torsion , which vanishes identically , to obtain the jacobi equation @xmath67 here , as is well known , the torsion tensor and the riemann curvature tensor are defined , respectively , to be @xmath68,\\\\[2 mm ]      { \\boldsymbol{r}}({\\boldsymbol{y}},{\\boldsymbol{z } } ) { \\boldsymbol{w } } & = \\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{y } } } \\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{z } } } { \\boldsymbol{w}}- \\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{z } } } \\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{y } } } { \\boldsymbol{w}}- \\nabla_{[{\\boldsymbol{y}},{\\boldsymbol{z } } ] } { \\boldsymbol{w } } ,         \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , and the riemann curvature tensor has symmetries such as @xmath70      & = - { \\boldsymbol{g } } ( { \\boldsymbol{r}}({\\boldsymbol{y}},{\\boldsymbol{z } } ) { \\boldsymbol{u } } , { \\boldsymbol{w } } )      = { \\boldsymbol{g } } ( { \\boldsymbol{r}}({\\boldsymbol{w } } , { \\boldsymbol{u } } ) { \\boldsymbol{y}},{\\boldsymbol{z } } ) ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 .",

    "however , the jacobi equations ( [ eq : jacobi - eq ] ) with the curvature tensor for the jacobi metric are not brought into the same equations as ( [ eq : linearized - newton - eq ] ) , a linearization of newton s equations of motion , in general .",
    "components of the curvature tensor for @xmath80 are indeed put in the form @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87",
    "in the previous section , we have mentioned that trajectories of a natural dynamical system with a fixed energy can be regarded as geodesics on a suitable riemannian manifold , and that stability / instability of the trajectories are analyzed through the jacobi equation , a linearization of the geodesic equation . however , the jacobi equation is a second - order differential equation , while lyapunov analysis is applied to first - order differential equations .",
    "we hence need a first - order differential equation associated with the jacobi equation in order to apply lyapunov analysis .",
    "to find such a first - order differential equation , we are working on the cotangent bundle @xmath39 of a riemannian manifold @xmath28 along with some geometric setting - ups on @xmath88 .",
    "related topics on @xmath39 will be described in appendix [ sec : appendixa ] .    at first ,",
    "let us be reminded of a minimum on cotangent bundles .",
    "let @xmath28 be an @xmath42-dimensional riemannian manifold endowed with riemannian metric @xmath89 , and @xmath88 the cotangent bundle of @xmath28 with the projection @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath91 be local coordinates in an open subset @xmath92 and in @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "further , let @xmath94 be another local coordinates in @xmath95 with @xmath96",
    ". then one has the coordinate transformation in the intersection @xmath97 , @xmath98      we recall that newton s equations of motion have been already  geometrized \" so as to be geodesic equations on a suitable riemannian manifold , so that further external force does nt need to be taken into account anymore . in other words , we have only to consider a free particle motion on @xmath28 . in the hamiltonian formalism , the hamiltonian we then have to study should be given , on @xmath88 , by @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "hamilton s equations of motion for @xmath101 are then put in the form @xmath102 where use has been made of the equality @xmath103 it is an easy matter to show that eq.([eq : hamilton - eq ] ) projects to geodesic equation on @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , put together , differentiation of the first equation of ( [ eq : hamilton - eq ] ) with respect to @xmath35 and the second equation of ( [ eq : hamilton - eq ] ) along with the above equality provide geodesic equations . as is well known , eq.([eq : hamilton - eq ] ) is associated with the hamiltonian vector field @xmath104 given by @xmath105 integral curves of ( [ eq : hamiltonian - flow - geo ] ) are called geodesic flows .",
    "we note here that the nomenclature  geodesic flows \" are usually assigned to the corresponding flows on the tangent bundle , but we use the word for convenience sake .",
    "it is worth noting here that how geodesic flows on @xmath39 project to geodesics on @xmath28 .",

    "define a tangent vector @xmath109 to @xmath28 at @xmath110 by @xmath111 .",
    "then the projection @xmath112 is a geodesic with the initial value @xmath113 .",
    "varying @xmath114 with @xmath108 but fixing @xmath11 , we obtain an @xmath115-parameter family of geodesic flows on @xmath39 , which projects to an @xmath115-parameter family of geodesics passing the point @xmath11 of @xmath28",
    ". furthermore , the vector field @xmath104 projects to the tangent vector field @xmath60 to this family of geodesics @xmath28 .",
    "however , @xmath60 has singularity only at @xmath116 in a neighborhood of @xmath11 .",
    "we have to note that if all geodesic flows on @xmath88 project to geodesics @xmath28 , those geodesics may not define such a tangent vector field uniquely .",
    "if there is another @xmath115-parameter family of geodesic flows on @xmath88 , it may project to another @xmath115-parameter family of geodesics on @xmath28 along with a tangent vector field like @xmath60 .      to describe geodesic flows in a more geometric way",
    ", we introduce an adapted frame and an adapted coframe on @xmath117 by the use of the christoffel symbols @xmath118 on @xmath28 .",
    "the adapted frame and coframe are defined , in @xmath93 , to be @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively , where @xmath121 .",
    "these frames are dual to each other , _ i.e. _ , satisfy @xmath122 if there is another adapted frame @xmath123 in an open set @xmath124 and if the intersection @xmath125 is non - empty , then from ( [ eq : coordinates - transf ] ) it follows that the adapted frames are subject to the transformation @xmath126 for adapted coframes , an analogous transformation holds as well .",
    "the transformation ( [ eq : f - transf ] ) implies that @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , define , respectively , subspaces @xmath129 and @xmath130 of the tangent space @xmath131 at each point @xmath132 independently of the choice of adapted frames .",
    "thus one obtains a direct sum decomposition of the tangent space to @xmath39 at each point @xmath133 ; @xmath134 the subspaces @xmath129 and @xmath130 are called the horizontal and the vertical subspace of @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "we notice here that @xmath129 and @xmath136 are isomorphic as vector spaces . note further that the transformation rule for the standard frame @xmath137 is mixed up , so that one can not define a subspace , say , @xmath138 independently of the choice of natural frames .",
    "see @xcite for adapted frames on the tangent bundle @xmath139 .    in terms of the adapted frame ,",
    "the hamiltonian vector field @xmath104 becomes expressed as @xmath140 which shows that @xmath104 is a horizontal vector field and further that geodesic flows are horizontal curves in the sense that the tangent vectors to them are always horizontal .",
    "as is already seen , the tangent space to @xmath39 at each point of @xmath39 is decomposed into a direct sum .",
    "we can define a metric on @xmath39 so that the decomposition may be orthogonal direct sum .",
    "one of such metrics is the sasaki metric , which is a lifted metric @xmath141 given by @xmath142 this metric is defined independently of the choice of adapted coframes .",
    "we notice here that the sasaki metric was first introduced on the tangent bundle @xmath139 @xcite , but we use the same nomenclature on the cotangent bundle @xmath88 as well .    by using the sasaki metric , the arc length on @xmath39 is defined as @xmath143 it then turns out that geodesic flows on @xmath39 take the same arc length as the corresponding geodesics on @xmath28 have , since one has @xmath144 for horizontal curves , and since geodesic flows are horizontal .",
    "hence the parameter @xmath35 used in hamilton s equation ( [ eq : hamilton - eq ] ) may be interpreted as the arc length on @xmath28 , so that the geodesic @xmath112 on @xmath28 is described in the arc length parameter .",
    "we will adopt the sasaki metric on @xmath39 to discuss orthogonality of lyapunov vectors on @xmath39 in the next section .",
