    "the nonet of light scalar mesons formed by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 is poorly understood @xcite . compared to expectations based on a standard quark antiquark picture",
    "all nine states are rather light and their ordering is inverted . this can , however , naturally be explained assuming a tetraquark structure , which is also supported by certain decay channels , e.g.  @xmath5 .    here",
    "we report about the status of an ongoing long - term project with the aim to study such tetraquark candidates using lattice qcd .",
    "we mainly focus on the @xmath0 . in section  [ sec001 ]",
    "we summarize recently published results obtained with wilson twisted mass quarks , where diagrams with closed fermion loops ( also called `` singly disconnected diagrams '' ) have been neglected @xcite . in section  [ sec455 ]",
    "we discuss latest technical advances obtained with clover improved wilson quarks , in particular the inclusion of diagrams with closed fermion loops .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec769 ] we discuss first steps of a study of a possibly existing @xmath1 tetraquark , which has recently been predicted using a coupled system of covariant bethe - salpeter equations @xcite .",
    "we use gauge link configurations with 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical quark flavors generated by the etm collaboration @xcite .",
    "we consider several ensembles with lattice spacing @xmath6 .",
    "the ensembles differ in the volume @xmath7 and the unphysically heavy @xmath8 quark mass corresponding to @xmath9 .    for the computations presented in this section we have ignored diagrams with closed fermion loops , which are technically rather challenging ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec500 ] ) .",
    "physical consequences are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 has quantum numbers @xmath10 .",
    "as usual in lattice qcd we extract the low lying spectrum in that sector by studying the asymptotic exponential behavior of correlation functions @xmath11 @xcite . @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 denote suitable creation operators , i.e.  operators generating the @xmath0 quantum numbers , when applied to the vacuum state .    assuming that the experimentally measured @xmath0 with mass @xmath14 is a rather strongly bound four quark state , suitable creation operators to excite such a state are @xmath15 the first operator has the spin / color structure of a @xmath16 molecule .",
    "the second resembles a bound diquark antidiquark pair , where spin coupling via @xmath17 corresponds to the lightest diquarks / antidiquarks ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "further low lying states with @xmath0 quantum numbers , which need to be considered are the two - particle states @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "suitable creation operators to resolve these states are @xmath20      figure  [ f001](left ) shows effective mass plots for a @xmath21 correlation matrix with a @xmath16 molecule operator ( [ eqn001 ] ) and a diquark - antidiquark operator ( [ eqn002 ] ) ( lattice volume @xmath22 , pion mass @xmath23 ) .",
    "the corresponding two plateaus are around @xmath24 and , therefore , consistent both with the expectation for possibly existing @xmath0 tetraquark states and with two - particle @xmath18 and @xmath19 states , where both particles are at rest ( @xmath25 ; @xmath26 in our lattice setup ) .    increasing this correlation matrix to @xmath27 by adding @xmath18 two - particle and @xmath19 two - particle operators ( eqs .",
    "( [ eqn003 ] ) and ( [ eqn004 ] ) ) yields the effective mass results shown in figure  [ f001](right ) .",
    "two additional states are observed , whose plateaus are around @xmath28 .    from these plots",
    "one can conclude that the two low - lying states are the expected two - particle @xmath18 and @xmath19 states , while an additional stable @xmath0 tetraquark state does not exist .",
    "the second and third excitation can also be interpreted as two - particle states , which have non - vanishing relative momentum .",
    "a detailed discussion of these plots and corresponding arguments can be found in @xcite .",
    "qualitatively identical results are found , when using other ensembles with light quark masses and spacetime volumes as mentioned in section  [ sec388 ] .",
    "recently we started to perform similar computations using gauge link configurations generated by the pacs - cs collaboration @xcite with 2 + 1 flavors of clover improved wilson sea quarks , a lattice spacing @xmath29 , a volume @xmath30 and a @xmath8 quark mass corresponding to @xmath31 . a significant advantage compared to wilson",
    "twisted mass quarks is that parity and isospin are exact symmetries .",
    "for example there is no pion and kaon mass splitting and @xmath32 and @xmath33 states are separated by quantum numbers ( these problems in the context of wilson twisted mass quarks and the @xmath0 are discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "a major improvement compared to our previous results presented in section  [ sec377 ] is that this time diagrams with closed fermion loops are included , i.e.  where strange quark propagators start and end at the same timeslice .",
    "ignoring such diagrams introduces a systematic error , which is hard to quantify . with these new computations",
    "this systematic error has been eliminated .",
    "another important consequence of the inclusion of closed fermion loop is that quark - antiquark and four - quark trial states can have non - vanishing overlap .",
    "this allows to study a larger correlation matrix containing not only the four - quark operators ( [ eqn001 ] ) to ( [ eqn004 ] ) , but also a quark - antiquark operator @xmath34 such a correlation matrix will enable us to make stronger statements about the structure of states from the @xmath0 sector .",
    "the techniques we use to compute these diagrams with closed fermion loops are described in @xcite .      at the moment",
    "only the computation of a @xmath21 correlation matrix containing the @xmath35 operator ( eq .  ( [ eqn645 ] ) ) and the four - quark @xmath16 molecule operator ( eq .  ( [ eqn001 ] ) ) has been finished .",
    "the effective masses corresponding to the diagonal element of the @xmath35 operator is plotted in figure  [ f004 ] , left .",
    "the plot on the right shows the two effective masses obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem using the full @xmath21 correlation matrix .",
    "all effective masses are around @xmath36 and , therefore , consistent with @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and also with @xmath39 .",
    "effective masses as functions of the temporal separation . *",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    for statements regarding the structure of the observed states we need to include also the four - quark operators ( [ eqn002 ] ) to ( [ eqn004 ] ) , which is currently in progress .",
    "this will allow us to address similar questions as in section  [ sec377 ] , i.e.  to answer , whether there is in addition to the two - particle @xmath18 and @xmath40 states also a third ( bound ) state near the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "we also intend to study the volume dependence of the two - particle spectrum using `` lscher s method '' ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) or improved techniques taking e.g.  coupled channel scattering into account @xcite .",
    "such computations are very challenging using lattice qcd , but first results have recently been published , e.g.  for the @xmath41 and positive parity @xmath42 mesons @xcite .",
    "recently a @xmath43 tetraquark has been predicted using a coupled system of covariant bethe - salpeter equations @xcite .",
    "it is expected to be a mesonic molecule - like state formed by two @xmath44 mesons with a mass of @xmath45 . comparing this mass to @xmath46",
    "indicates that the binding energy could be quite large , @xmath47 .",
    "the uncertainty quoted in @xcite is , however , of the same order of magnitude .",
    "investing such a @xmath43 tetraquark using lattice methods could provide an independent confirmation of its existence .",
    "we use the same setup as discussed for the @xmath0 meson in section  [ sec455 ] . in a first attempt we consider a single creation operator of molecule type , which models a bound @xmath48 state , @xmath49 diagrams with closed fermion loops",
    "are ignored .    in figure  [ f005 ]",
    "we compare the corresponding effective mass ( blue points ) with two times the @xmath44 effective mass ( red points ) .",
    "we do not observe any indication of a four quark @xmath43 state , which is lighter than @xmath50 . on the other hand",
    "the effective mass corresponding to the creation operator ( [ eqn650 ] ) still seems to slightly decrease at large temporal separations and does not exhibit a clear plateau .",
    "this signals a trial state @xmath51 , which has a poor ground state overlap .",
    "the ground state could either be two unbound @xmath44 ( then the plateau is expected at @xmath50 ) or still a @xmath43 bound state , however , with a structure quite different from ( [ eqn650 ] ) .",
    "effective mass as functions of the temporal separation for the @xmath48 molecule operator ( blue points ) and the @xmath44 meson multiplied by a factor @xmath52 ( red points).,width=264 ]    currently we explore the latter alternative . while the creation operator ( [ eqn650 ] ) places the two @xmath44 mesons essentially on top of each other , they could be rather far separated , e.g.  by a distance up to @xmath53 ( for a recent study of this distance for heavy - heavy - light - light tetraquarks cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to this end",
    "we employ corresponding more general molecule type @xmath43 creation operators .",
