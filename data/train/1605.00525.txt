    "intermediary orbits provide approximate analytical solutions to the artificial satellite problem . by definition , _ common _ intermediaries of the main problem , which are simplifications of the geopotential where only the @xmath0 term is taken into account , must capture all the secular effects up to the first order of @xmath0 @xcite . in the _ natural _ perspective ,",
    "main problem intermediaries are able to cope with all the first order periodic effects in addition to the secular terms @xcite .    in spite of their limited precision , it has recently been demonstrated that evaluation of intermediary orbits can compete in some cases with standard numerical integration of simplified models , and , in particular , in the case of short - term onboard orbit propagation of low earth orbits ( leo ) . indeed , the intrinsic uncertainty with which the satellite position is usually known onboard makes the errors obtained with both approaches , numerical integration and intermediary evaluation , to share similar statistics @xcite .",
    "this characteristic motivates the current interest in the search for new approximate analytical solutions of the artificial satellite problem @xcite .",
    "besides , the fact that , contrary to usual intermediaries , deprit s ( @xcite ) radial intermediary does not depend on special functions , makes its evaluation straightforward and , therefore , proves to be a suitable candidate for the implementation of orbit propagators to be used onboard .    on the other hand , exclusion of higher order harmonics",
    "is known to bring relevant errors into the predicted orbit . besides , it is known that the uncertainties introduced in the computation of the initial conditions in the intermediary variables when neglecting periodic effects of the second order of @xmath0 , are an important source of errors in the short - term propagation of artificial satellites @xcite .",
    "hence , inclusion of as many higher order short - period effects as possible , in addition to the secular terms of the second order , seems imperative for extending the validity of intermediary solutions to encompass several orbital periods or days .",
    "we explore the performances of natural intermediary solutions that include the gravitational effects of the earth s zonal harmonics up to @xmath1 .",
    "like in the case of the main problem , the intermediaries are obtained from the simplified hamiltonian stemming from the elimination of the parallax @xcite . in particular ,",
    "two radial intermediaries are discussed which show similar efficiency for short - term propagation , yet the second intermediary improves the accuracy by accounting for long - period terms .",
    "the first intermediary is obtained by neglecting the dynamics associated to the trigonometric terms in the argument of the perigee ; the resulting hamiltonian is radial and , therefore , can be integrated by separation of variables .",
    "alternatively , it is converted into a pure keplerian system by means of a torsion transformation @xcite .",
    "because the neglected , second order terms are factorized by the eccentricity , the use of the intermediary is constrained to the case of the lower eccentricity orbits , which is the case of most operational satellites in leo .",
    "this intermediary includes the secular terms of the solution up to the second order of @xmath0 and the short - period corrections up to the same order . due to the precision with which the short - period corrections are computed ,",
    "the uncertainties in the computation of initial conditions in the intermediary variables are very small , in this way enlarging the time span in which ephemeris predictions are of acceptable accuracy .    however , including second order short - period corrections in the intermediary",
    "is at the cost of degrading computation performance in terms of time and power consumption .",
    "since the intermediary is intended for onboard orbit propagation , where both memory allocation and power consumption may be an issue , several simplifications to reduce the computational burden to a minimum are applied . in particular , a simplified version of the intermediary is developed in which the direct short - period corrections are limited to first order effects , while keeping the secular terms up to the second order .",
    "still , the inverse short - period corrections include the most relevant second order terms , and hence the simplified intermediary has comparable precision to the full version in the computation of initial conditions in the intermediary variables chart . this simplified version of the intermediary clearly provides better accuracy than other main problem intermediaries , and in particular than deprit s ( first order ) radial intermediary @xcite , whereas the computational effort is only increased slightly .",
    "therefore , the simplified version of the intermediary can advantageously compete with the usual cowell integration of the @xmath0 problem for short - term prediction .",
    "the second intermediary is designed to improve accuracy .",
    "indeed , the first radial intermediary has been constructed by ignoring those second order terms of the hamiltonian after the elimination of the parallax which are factored by the eccentricity . as a consequence",
    ", the intermediary solution is affected by long - period errors related to the neglected perigee dynamics .",
    "even though the amplitude of these long - period errors is small and the missing terms do not deteriorate too much the intermediary solution in the short - time spans for which the intermediary predictions are intended , their effects are clearly apparent since the beginning of the propagation . on the contrary , the second intermediary recovers the neglected long - period effects by carrying out an additional transformation . in the wake of classic analytical perturbation methods , the long - period dynamics can be removed , rather than ignored , by means of the elimination of the perigee simplification @xcite . regrettably , the additional equations introduced in the solution by this new canonical transformation slow down the evaluation of the second intermediary , on one side , and give rise to the small divisors problem related to the critical inclination resonance , on the other . however , both inconveniences are easily avoided in the case of leo , where second order terms factored by the _",
    "square _ of the eccentricity , which appear associated to the even zonal harmonics , can be directly neglected .",
    "the remaining long - period terms , which are related to the latitudinal asymmetry of the geopotential and do not experience the small divisors problem , are recovered by means of extremely simple corrections of straightforward evaluation .",
    "in addition , the transformation equations of the elimination of the perigee of the terms related to the @xmath2 harmonic coefficient can be dramatically simplified in the case of leo , in this way producing effective corrections while insignificantly increasing the evaluation effort of the second intermediary solution .",
    "it is not a surprise that the simplified long - period gravitational corrections used by the second intermediary match corresponding ones in the sgp4 propagator @xcite , even though the latter come from brouwer s gravitational solution in which the perigee is averaged by a canonical transformation only _ after _ the short - period terms have been completely removed from the original hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "quite on the contrary , the essential short - period terms of the zonal problem remain in the quasi - keplerian , intermediary solution .",
    "however , since the elimination of the perigee is carried out only up to the first order , this identity was indeed expected from the commutativity of infinitesimal transformations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the dynamical model used is described in section [ s : dm ] .",
    "it follows in section [ s : lis ] the derivation of the first intermediary solution using the usual approach .",
    "then , section [ s : ne ] presents some numerical tests that show the higher accuracy of the new intermediary over the numerical integration of the main problem .",
    "next , allowable simplifications that speed up evaluation of the first intermediary while keeping sufficient accuracy are discussed in section [ s : fe ] .",
    "the improvements achieved by the second intermediary , where long - period corrections are taken into account , are analyzed in section [ s : lpc ] .",
    "finally , the procedure for obtaining the analytical solutions as well as the algorithms that implement them are recapitulated in section [ s : recapitulation ] , where runtime comparisons between the @xmath0 numerical integration and the analytical solutions are also carried out for the particular case of planet labs - dove satellites .. accessed :",

    "the incorporation of a realistic atmospheric drag model into the intermediary solution , whose effect can be as important as the @xmath0 disturbances for the lower altitude orbits , is not discussed in the paper , which constrains its scope to providing efficient alternatives for those problems where the cowell integration of the @xmath0 problem is the standard approach .",
    "the model includes effects of the main gravitational harmonics of the geopotential , namely those corresponding to the zonal harmonic coefficients @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 . missing other disturbing effects , as atmospheric drag , lunisolar perturbations or tesseral and higher order zonal harmonics , of course makes predictions based on the @xmath0@xmath1 model of limited precision",
    ". however , this simple model may be useful for short - term propagation , say in time spans ranging from a few minutes to a few orbits , where it would improve predictions in all those cases in which the simpler @xmath0 model is currently been used .",
    "since the dynamical model is conservative the problem is formulated in the hamiltonian frame , @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the keplerian attraction , and @xmath5 is the disturbing function which encompasses the non - centralities of the gravitational potential due to the zonal harmonics ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",

    "the keplerian part of the hamiltonian is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the orbit semi - major axis .",

    "furthermore , since we are using hamiltonian formalism , we assume that @xmath16 , @xmath8 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 are functions of the delaunay canonical variables , which are given by the mean anomaly @xmath22 , the argument of perigee @xmath23 , the right ascension of the ascending node @xmath24 , the delaunay action @xmath25 , the modulus of the angular momentum @xmath26 , and the projection of the angular momentum vector along the earth s rotation axis @xmath27 . in particular , @xmath28 where the conic parameter @xmath29 and the orbit eccentricity @xmath30 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the true anomaly , is an implicit function of @xmath22 whose computation requires solving the kepler equation .    the zonal hamiltonian given by eqs .",

    "however , in some cases , the zonal hamiltonian can be simplified to the extent of providing useful approximate solutions , whose validity is constrained to certain regions of phase space and apply only during a limited time interval .",

    "indeed , in the short time span encompassed by the propagation , these long - period effects result in an analogous trend in the errors of both the main problem numerical integration and the intermediary analytical solution , the former being also affected by evident short - period effects that are a consequence of the missed harmonics in the main problem model ( top - right plot and center - left and -right plots in fig .

    "similar tests have been performed for a variety of orbits , always finding analogous results . in particular ,",

    "the worst results of the intermediary propagation are obtained for jason1 and atv .",
    "this was expected from their higher values of the eccentricity when compared to other cases , which make errors related to the neglected long - period terms to be more apparent .",
    "still , results provided by the intermediary are quite accurate and clearly defeat those provided by the numerical integration of the main problem , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : atv1dayj2 ] for the case of atv .",
    "keeping second order short - period effects in the computation of osculating elements may exceed the typical requirements for these kinds of simplified propagations , as , for instance when using sgp4 .",
    "hence , a way of speeding up evaluation of the intermediary propagation is to neglect the second order corrections of the _ direct _ transformation ( from intermediary , prime variables to osculating ones ) . on the contrary , in order to avoid introducing additional uncertainties in an ephemeris propagation , the initial transformation from osculating variables to intermediary variables should be as accurate as possible @xcite .",
    "therefore , the whole second order _ inverse _",
    "corrections should be taken into account .",
    "however , it must be noted that not all the orbital elements contribute in the same way to this additional uncertainty due to the truncation of the short - period , inverse transformation . indeed ,",
    "because of the known lyapunov instability of keplerian motion , the more relevant source of errors in an ephemeris propagation is associated to an uncertainty in the initial value of the semi - major axis , for it directly modifies the value of the mean motion cf .  the thorough discussion in @xcite .",
    "how this error in the initial semi - major axis is extended to the polar - nodal elements is investigated as follows .    since the ( osculating ) semi - major axis",

    "therefore , the algorithm implementing the intermediary propagation is simplified by neglecting all the second order short - period corrections of the _ direct _ transformation , on the one hand , and neglecting those terms of the second order _",
    "inverse _ transformation that contribute terms of the order of @xmath90 to eq .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) , on the other hand .",
    "in particular , the only second order inverse corrections that are taken into account are : the second order correction to @xmath49 , which is taken with full precision up to @xmath91 , and the second order correction to @xmath8 , which is simplified by retaining only terms of @xmath89 .",

    "complete second order corrections , which were thoroughly used when the intermediary was under development , can be found in @xcite , in which terms of the order of @xmath92 and higher were neglected in agreement with other leo simplifications .    from our numerical tests , we found that these simplifications radically reduce the effort in evaluating the intermediary to about one third of the case in which full second order corrections are used .",

    "still , the fact that the intermediary includes secular terms of the second order of @xmath0 , makes that the errors of the intermediary propagation in the mean argument of latitude and right ascension of the ascending node remain free from the secular trend that affects corresponding errors of the main problem integration .",

    "in addition , in order to speed computations , the inverse correction to the inclination angle can be directly computed as @xmath111 moreover , calling @xmath112 , we compute @xmath113 which is also free from singularities in the case of low inclination orbits . then , in the leo assumption of low eccentricity , the inverse long - period corrections can be further simplified by neglecting @xmath114 , to obtain @xmath115 which are evaluated in prime variables , thus negligibly increasing the computational load of the intermediary .",
    "it is not a surprise that the long - period corrections in eqs .",
    "( [ deltailp ] ) and ( [ deltaslpsimp ] ) are exactly the same as the long - period gravitational corrections used in the sgp4 propagator @xcite , where they are used as direct corrections and hence have the opposite sign .",
    "this is just a consequence of our ( and theirs ! )",

    "( [ perigeegen ] ) , matches the corresponding term of the generating function of brouwer s long period averaging based on von zeipel s algorithm @xcite .",
    "this feature , which becomes clearly apparent when the elimination of the perigee is carried out in delaunay variables , does not seem to have been previously noticed probably because the traditional way in which the elimination of the perigee is computed provides the generating function in the form of a mixture of polar nodal variables and parallactic functions that complicates things unnecessarily ( see * ? ? ? * for further details on this topic ) .",
    "the improvements achieved when the intermediary solution is upgraded with long - period corrections are illustrated in fig .",

    "plots in the left column of fig .",
    "[ f : spotzvsj2lp ] correspond to the accelerated intermediary without long - period corrections and those in the right column do incorporate the long - period corrections to the accelerated intermediary .",
    "the removal of most of the long - period errors from the intermediary propagation is evident now from a simple comparison of the left and right columns of fig .",
    "[ f : spotzvsj2lp ] .",
    "the radical improvement of the intermediary performance obtained when long - period corrections are taken into account is better illustrated when the propagation is extended to four months , a time interval that encompasses one full period of the perigee motion of the spot satellite .",
    "corresponding results are presented in fig .",
    "[ f : spotzvsj2lp4 ] , where the effects of neglecting the long - period terms associated to the @xmath2 harmonic coefficient are clearly apparent . in particular , a long - period modulation of the errors of the intermediary propagation with the same period as the argument of the perigee of the spot satellite ( of about 16 weeks and a half ) is now clearly noted in the inclination and the eccentricity . because of that , the errors of the elements @xmath101 and @xmath102 are very similar in the @xmath0 numerical integration and in the intermediary evaluation when long - period effects are neglected , although for the later the amplitude of the short - period errors is almost negligible because of the first order short - period corrections used by the intermediary .",
    "quite on the contrary , the long - period errors of the intermediary propagation reduce to a minimum when the elimination of the perigee is included in the algorithm .",
    "a cascade of canonical transformations @xmath116 @xmath117 , allowed us to reduce , after truncation , the 2-dof zonal hamiltonian @xmath118 to a pure keplerian system ( in new variables ) : @xmath119 the sequence of symbolic manipulations that lead to the integrable solution is as follows :    * the elimination of the parallax @xmath120 is applied to remove non - essential short - period terms up to the second order of @xmath0 .",
    "the simplified hamiltonian remains of 2-dof , and is further simplified in the case of low eccentricity orbits : @xmath121 * next , the elimination of the perigee @xmath122 is applied to @xmath123 @xmath124 after truncation , the new hamiltonian is of 1-dof , and , therefore , integrable .",

    "this sequence gives rise to what we called the `` second '' intermediary .",
    "for the case of the lower eccentricity orbits , the elimination of the parallax can be written as @xmath130 which , after truncation , can be directly converted into a pure keplerian system by means of the torsion @xmath125 , giving rise to what we called the `` first '' intermediary .",

    "the intermediary propagation can also be advantageous in terms of computing time .",
    "however , because numerical and analytical methods are essentially different in nature , a direct comparison between both approaches only makes sense when the needs for ephemeris representation are clearly understood .",
    "indeed , while analytical solutions can be directly evaluated at a given time , the numerical procedure requires a step by step integration .",
    "hence , one must establish the particular scenario in which the method is applied and limit the conclusions to this particular scenario . in our case , we are interested in applications to onboard orbit propagation .",
    "therefore , we assume the same scenario as in @xcite , in which the cowell integration is carried out with a fourth - order r - k integration using a constant step - size of one second .",
    "to illustrate runtime comparisons , we focus on the one - day propagation of the initial conditions of a typical satellite of the planet labs - dove constellation an almost circular sun - synchronous orbit at about 475 km of altitude although similar results are obtained when performing analogous tests for the other satellites in table [ t : iicc ] . the propagation errors in cartesian",
    "coordinates for this case are presented in fig .",
    "[ f : planetlab1st ] , where it is shown that the accuracy of the accelerated first intermediary is roughly one order of magnitude better than the @xmath0 problem r - k propagation .",
    "we checked that both , the r - k and the analytical solution take the same time when the accelerated first intermediary is evaluated each second and a half , which means a flight of the `` dove '' of about 12 km .",
    "hence , the first intermediary will be advantageous both in terms of accuracy and computing time when ephemeris are acceptable for larger intervals than 12 km .",
    "for instance , if lab - dove s ephemeris are recorded each four minutes or more precisely , when the one day propagation interval is divided into 333 steps , which allowed to display smooth graphics in fig .",
    "[ f : planetlab1st] the first intermediary is about 130 times faster than the r - k integration of the @xmath0 problem .",
    "runtime performance slightly deteriorates in the case of the second intermediary .",
    "nevertheless , the four minutes evaluation case shows that the second intermediary still performs 100 times faster than r - k , whereas the runtime performance of both methods balance when the second intermediary is evaluated about each 2.5 seconds in which the dove flies @xmath147 km .",
    "these ratios may still improve by making additional efforts in optimizing the evaluation of the analytical solutions .",
    "in particular , algorithm [ alg1 ] clearly discloses the _ profile _ @xcite of the intermediary procedure , which suggests that further work should concentrate in speeding up the evaluation of the different direct transformations of the intermediary solution .",
    "inclusion of higher order harmonics of the gravitational potential clearly improves the propagation model for leo orbits , but notably penalizes the usual cowell integration in terms of computing time .",
    "this increase of the computational load , which is directly reflected in power consumption , can be radically alleviated in the case of the lower eccentricity orbits , which are the majority in a leo catalogue .",
    "indeed , for the usual eccentricities of operational satellites in leo , the cowell propagation can be replaced by an analytical intermediary solution within a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the intermediaries proposed in the present research include higher order secular and periodic effects , which admit a compact form of straightforward evaluation when using polar - nodal variables , and hence may be adequate for onboard orbit propagation in such satellite missions in which reduced power consumption is a constraint .",
