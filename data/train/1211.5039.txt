    "intersubband polaritons are elementary excitations of microcavities embedding doped semiconductor quantum wells . in particular , they are the normal modes due to the strong coupling between a cavity photon mode and the transition between two conduction subbands in quantum wells containing a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "intersubband polaritons were experimentally demonstrated for the first time in 2003@xcite and their physics is the object of many interesting investigations , both fundamental @xcite and applied @xcite .",
    "so far , theoretical investigations have been based mostly on a bosonized hamiltonian approach @xcite . in the dilute regime ,",
    "i.e. , when the excitation density is much smaller than the electronic density in the doped quantum wells , intersubband polaritons behave as ( composite ) bosons . at higher excitation densities anyway , pauli saturation effects due to electron fermionic statistics and deviations from the bosonic behavior are expected @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the physics of such excitations is the role of the coulomb interaction . in the case of bare intersubband transitions ,",
    "coulomb interaction is known not to modify dramatically the polaritonic lineshape @xcite , being responsible mainly for a simple shift of the excitation frequency , the so - called depolarization shift .",
    "this is why , in many relevant situations , the presence of the coulomb interaction can be in first approximation neglected , by using a renormalized ( measured ) value for the frequency of the intersubband transition instead of the bare one , calculated from the single - electron subband structure .",
    "very recently , the role of coulomb interaction in intersubband polariton systems has started to attract interest . in ref .",
    "[ ] the part of the coulomb interaction responsible for the depolarization shift has been studied in the bosonic excitation formalism , allowing to calculate the renormalization from first principles .",
    "other works have studied the same problem using different gauges @xcite and a green functions approach @xcite . as a matter of fact , up to now , only depolarization or static effects have been taken into account .",
    "hence , the general problem of the many - body physics of intersubband polaritons is largely unexplored , in particular the physics of polariton - polariton interactions and polariton - polariton scattering .    in this paper",
    "we derive a microscopic many - body theory describing the intersubband polariton - polariton scattering due both to the coulomb interaction and to the non - perfect bosonicity of the intersubband excitations . as a first application of the present theoretical formalism",

    "as the quantum wells confine the electrons along the growth direction , the electronic bands will be split into multiple , almost parallel subbands .",
    "the optically active transitions we are interested in will thus be the ones from the last occupied conduction subband to the first unoccupied one .",
