    "the functional rg , applicable both at weak and strong coupling , has also been used for the computation of thermal effects , e.g.  @xcite .",

    ", we extend and detail the proposal @xcite .",
    "we construct thermal flows that are well - defined both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet , and provide ideal starting points for numerical and analytical studies .",
    "in scalar theories , we work out the scheme - independent part of the integrated flow , which contains the one loop thermally resummed perturbation theory .",
    "we equally provide thermal flows within a thermal derivative expansion , and reproduce explicitly the leading order results for the pressure and the thermal self energy .    for gauge theories , and for specific momentum cutoff and gauges ,",
    "the thermal flow even respects gauge invariance for arbitrary scale @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from two observations .",

    "the physics behind this is that a change of @xmath39 due to a further coarse graining ( i.e. the integrating - out of a thin momentum shell about @xmath1 ) is dominated by the fluctuations with momenta about @xmath1 .",

    "the thermal flow has another important advantage that is particularly interesting for its application to gauge theories .",
    "we can relax the conditions @xmath50 on the regulator .",
    "the aim is to find a reliable , but still sufficiently simple and manageable formulation of the flow equation .",
    "the first observation is that the flow equations and indeed are simplified for a mass - like regulator given by [ r - mass ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     or variants of it .",

    "the same reasoning applies . ]",

    ". however , the choice violates condition ( @xmath51 ) , which is one of the basic requirements for a wilsonian cutoff .",
    "indeed , the operator @xmath43 appearing in is neither peaked about @xmath52 , _ nor _ does it lead to a sufficient suppression of high momentum modes .",
    "the flow equation would then receive contributions from the high momentum region for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "an immediate consequence of this is that an additional uv regularisation is required , as the flow equation is no longer well - defined for large loop momenta .",
    "stated differently , on might say that a mass term regulator leads to a break - down of the wilsonian picture , since it is no longer related to an integrating - out of momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "rather , it corresponds to a flow within the space of massive theories .",
    "apart from these more formal objections one should mention that numerical solutions of are much more involved than for regulators satisfying @xmath53 . at every iterative step a @xmath54-dimensional momentum integral",
    "has to be performed in over a non - trivial function which is not strongly peaked about some momentum region .",
    "this is , numerically , a quite tedious problem .",
    "for this reason most of the sophisticated numerical investigations are based on non - local regulator functions ( like the sharp cutoff , exponential or algebraic ones ) .",
    "it has also been observed that approximate solutions to the flow equation ( expansions in powers of the field , derivative expansions ) show a rather poor convergence behaviour , when is used . in gauge theories ,",
    "this has been seen from explicit perturbative computations @xcite .",
    "consequently at @xmath49 it is not advisable to directly resort to a mass - like regulator .    while is not viable for quantum fluctuations being present in",
    ", we will now argue that it is perfectly viable for thermal ones in .",
    "the main point is that the large momentum fluctuations ( not sufficiently controlled by , introducing uv divergences to the flow equation ) have nothing to do with the heat bath .",
    "therefore , subtracting the zero temperature quantities will render the flow equation finite and well - defined , even in the presence of a mass - like regulator @xmath55 .",
    "then the flow boils down to @xmath56=   k^2\\int\\0{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\bigl[t\\ \\sum_{n }    g_{k , t}[\\phi ] -\\int { d p_0\\ov 2\\pi }    \\,g_{k,0}[\\phi]\\bigr ] -\\partial_t \\bar c_{k , t } \\ .",

    ", the matsubara sum can be replaced by an integral , thereby cancelling the @xmath49 contribution .",
    "therefore , one may read as a wilsonian flow for thermal fluctuations : at the starting point @xmath58 ( @xmath15 being some large uv scale ) all fluctuations are suppressed and vanishes . for any @xmath59 , the flow of @xmath17 $ ] would receive contributions for all momenta .",
    "in contrast , the difference @xmath60 $ ] is sensitive only to thermal fluctuations , which are peaked in the infrared region and naturally decay in the uv region .",
    "it follows that the integrand in is peaked about @xmath40 . in other words ,",
    "condition @xmath53 is effectively guaranteed even in the case of a mass - like regulator by the very nature of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "this amounts to the fact that the mass - like regulator seems to be a reasonable choice even for numerical applications in thermal field theories .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the cancellation of uv divergences in is reminiscent of the bphz - procedure .",

    "moreover , an important , direct , consequence of the flow is scheme independence of lowest order resummed perturbation theory : at this order the effective action at @xmath62 does neither depend on the regulator nor on the truncation .",

    "finally we want to comment on the computation of the thermal pressure .",
    "it is well - known that the computation requires the correct normalisation of the path integral , only physical degrees of freedom contribute to the pressure . in the present formalism",

    "such a procedure immediately results in @xmath206 the computation of higher contributions , in particular the resummation , requires the full one loop running of vertices and propagators .",
    "we also emphasise that already provides the closed expression for the resummation .",
    "we hope to report on this matter in near future .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a thermal renormalisation group in terms of the functional @xmath207=\\gamma_t[\\phi]-\\gamma_0[\\phi]$ ] .",

    "$ ] all thermal observables  including the thermal pressure and the thermal self - energy  can be obtained .",
    "our flow for @xmath208 is free of infrared and ultraviolet divergences and therefore well - suited for numerical and analytical studies .",
    "the running zero - temperature effective action serves as a boundary condition for the flow .",

    ", the thermal flow derives from a path integral representation of the theory .",
    "this ensures that no double counting occurs in the flow for @xmath207 $ ] and systematic solutions thereof .",
    "while the present construction is based on the imaginary time formalism , it is straightforward to implement these ideas even in a real - time formulation .    for scalar theories",
    ", we have shown that the leading - order resummed perturbation theory follows independently of the scheme , and independently of the truncation .",
    "quantitatively , this has been worked out to leading order within a thermal derivative expansion . furthermore , an optimised thermal flow for the effective potential has been provided .",
    "its simple analytic form allows for stable numerical integrations , in particular at strong coupling . as an aside , we point out how @xcite  where an infrared regulated resummation for the thermal pressure of scalar theories has been proposed  is related to our work .",
    "if we restrict the full thermal flow to scalar fields , and to leading order in the derivative expansion of the effective action at vanishing field , then corresponds to the imaginary - time analogue of @xcite .",
    "hence , @xcite has the interpretation of a leading - order wilsonian flow with mass term cutoff .",
    "since defines the field - dependent effective action , it allows for an extension of @xcite to higher order operators as well as to fermions and gauge fields .",
    "for gauge theories , the following picture has emerged : the standard wilsonian flow equation , equipped with the modified ward identity , allows for the consistent computation of infrared quantities starting with an initial action in the ultraviolet .",
    "gauge invariance is ensured in the physical limit .",
    "a gauge invariant implementation for all scales @xmath1  in the wilsonian sense  is problematic due to the poor performance of a mass - term regulator for quantum fluctuations in the ultraviolet .",
    "the important new result is that the thermal flow , instead , stays well - defined even for a mass - like regulator since the zero temperature contribution renders the flow finite .",
    "a mass term regulator fully pays off when combined with the axial gauge fixing , as it implies a gauge - invariant thermal flow for all scales @xmath1 .",
    "the difference to the flow stems now from the initial condition , which is no longer the bare action , but the running @xmath49 quantum effective action , or some approximation to it .",
