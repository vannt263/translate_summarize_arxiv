    "in intra - cellular biochemical reaction processes , some chemical species often play an important role at extremely low concentrations , amounting to only a few molecules per cell@xcite . in such situations , the fluctuations and discreteness in the molecule number",
    "are obviously important . on the other hand , in rate equations ,",
    "generally adopted in chemical kinetics , the concentration of each chemical species is treated as a continuous variable , and the fluctuations and the discreteness of the number of molecules are neglected . however , if the molecule number is not very large , the number fluctuations as well as discreteness in the number , rather than a continuous concentration , has to be considered seriously .",
    "of course , effects of fluctuations in concentrations are considered by using stochastic differential equations .",
    "indeed , several non - trivial noise - induced phenomena have been reported@xcite .",
    "however , in most of such studies , discreteness in the molecule numbers , i.e. , the number being 0,1,2 , .. , has not been considered seriously .",
    "recently , togashi and kaneko reported a drastic change in the steady distribution of chemical concentrations as a result of discreteness in the molecule number , by studying a catalytic reaction network with a few molecules species@xcite .",
    "novel types of dissipative structure formation , induced by very low concentration molecules , have also been investigated@xcite in a class of reaction - diffusion systems or the models of biochemical reactions in cells .",
    "the observed novel states in these studies are a result of fluctuations and discreteness in the molecular numbers , in particular of extinction and re - emergence of some molecule species , which alternate in time .",
    "relevance of such discreteness in molecule number to emergence of novel states should not be restricted to a simple reaction network with a few molecule species , but is also expected to exist in a wide variety of chemical reaction systems with a large number of species . here",
    ", dynamics and statistics of chemical reaction systems with a finite ( small ) number of molecules and a large number of molecule species have to be investigated .",
    "such study is important not only for biochemical reaction kinetics generally , but also as a problem of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . here",
    ", the criterion on `` smallness '' in the number itself should be clarified as a condition for discreteness - induced transition for a given chemical reaction network system .    in this paper , we study discreteness - induced transition in a reaction network where a large number of chemical species is connected by catalytic reaction paths chosen randomly . use of random catalytic reaction network is pioneered by kauffman @xcite for the problem of the origin of life , while studies in a growing cell model consisting of such reaction network have unveiled universal statistical behaviors of chemical concentrations , which are confirmed in the gene expression data in the present cells@xcite . here , we are interested in how discreteness in the molecule numbers affect global behavior of chemical reaction dynamics in such network . for simplicity , we only consider the reaction network whose steady state is unique and stationary when the number of molecules is infinite , i.e. , the corresponding rate equation has just a unique fixed point attractor . even in such a simple system , we find the following transition to a discreteness - induced state , which appears when the total number of the molecules is below a critical value ;    \\a ) chemical concentrations exhibit intermittent switching among several states with distinct chemical compositions .",
    "\\b ) the long time average of the chemical concentrations deviate distinctly from those expected in the continuum limit with a large number of molecules where the rate equation description is valid .",
    "we will also obtain the critical molecule number for this discreteness induced transition , whose dependence on the number of chemical species and path ratio of the reaction network will be derived .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a specific reaction network model , while numerical results to show the above transition with the decrease in the molecule number are presented in section 3 .",
    "possible mechanism for the transition is described in section 4 , where deficiency in some molecules is shown to introduce switching among several effective reaction networks that consist only of non - vanishing chemical species . in section 5",
    ", we obtain the critical number of molecules for the transition as a function of the number of molecule species and connectivity in the network .",
    "summary and discussion will be given in section 6 .",

    "the reaction coefficients are set to be identical for all reactions for simplicity , and chosen to be @xmath14 .",
    "then , the growth rate in @xmath15 ( or the decay rate in @xmath16 ) through this reaction is give by @xmath17 , on the average .",
    "the connection paths in a reaction network are chosen randomly ( and then fixed ) , where the average number of the reaction paths from a chemical @xmath7 to any other chemical species @xmath18 catalyzed by a chemical @xmath19 is set at a given connection number @xmath3 .",
    "we do not include auto - catalytic reaction in the form of @xmath20 , because such type of reaction is not usually elementary but is realized as a result of a series of ( non - auto - catalytic ) elementary reactions .",
    "also , inclusion of auto - catalytic paths sometimes leads to non - fixed - point or multiple attractors , which makes discussion on the discreteness effect complicated .",
    "we also include a flow of chemicals into and out of the system from the reservoir . with this process",
    ", the total number of molecules is fixed so that a molecule is regarded to be replaced by some other with a certain rate . instead of considering such flow",
    ", one can equivalently consider a combination of decomposition and synthesis of some chemicals , or non - catalytic changes between different molecule species that are chosen randomly from all chemicals with equal probability .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that this ` non - catalytic ' change occurs with equal probability @xmath21 for all molecules , while its rate is much smaller than that of the catalytic reaction .    numerical simulations are carried out by iterating the following stochastic processes .",
    "first , we randomly pick up a pair of molecules and if the pair is a substrate and catalyst according to the reaction network , the substrate molecule is transformed to the product molecule according to the reaction .",
    "second , we randomly pick up a molecule and transform it by a non - catalytic change , with a given , much lower , rate . here , a unit time is given as the time span in which monte - carlo steps for catalytic reactions are repeated @xmath22 times and those for non - catalytic processes are repeated @xmath0 times . in each time , each molecule collides with another molecule once on average , to check if the catalytic reaction occurs , while it is transformed transformed to some other chemical with probability @xmath21 by non - catalytic process .",
    "numerically , we apply this stochastic simulation , while in the cases with @xmath23 ( i.e. , continuous limit ) , the reaction dynamics are represented by the following rate equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is 1 if there is a reaction @xmath26 , and 0 otherwise .    in the following sections , we present numerical results of the stochastic simulations and show how the steady state properties of such catalytic reaction networks depend on the number of chemical species @xmath2 and of molecules @xmath0 . in this paper",

    "2(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "such non - stationary behavior is caused by the discreteness in the molecular number .",

    "then the number of reactive chemicals or of the catalysts often goes to @xmath38 , for all reaction paths .",
    "then , the catalytic reactions of the system freeze , while the system can escape from such freezing state as a result of non - catalytic changes ( flow of molecules ) .",

    "now , we focus on the transition of reaction dynamics at @xmath43 . for @xmath0 larger than @xmath43 ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the distribution of @xmath30 is almost stationary except for small fluctuations as in fig .",

    "2(b ) . in this case",
    ", the total reaction ratio is much smaller and the temporal fluctuation of each chemical concentration is much larger than the case with @xmath46 .",

    "this increase in the fluctuation is consistent with the fact that the switching behavior becomes dominant for @xmath45 .    as shown in fig .",
    "1 , switching over several states with different effective network occurs for small @xmath0 , as will be also discussed in the next section .",
    "as @xmath0 is decreased further below @xmath43 , the reaction occurs rarely , and thus the frequency of such switching decreases , while for large @xmath0 , the dynamics exhibit only small fluctuations around a stationary state .",

    "the behavior observed in the previous section is rather common over a variety of catalytic reaction networks .",
    "the dynamics and the time averaged distributions of @xmath51 for a case with @xmath52 differ distinctly from those with @xmath1 , because of the discreteness in the number of molecules . here",

    "stochastic switching over such states is commonly observed for a reaction network system with small @xmath0 , as given in fig .",
    "due to these switchings , the temporal fluctuation of each chemical concentration is enhanced , as given in fig .",

    "in section 3 , we suggested the existence of the critical total number of molecules @xmath43 , at which the behaviors of random catalytic networks change drastically . for @xmath46 , the behavior",
    "is well represented by continuum description , while for @xmath45 , deficiency in some molecule species suppresses the ongoing reaction . in this section ,",
    "we study dependence of this critical number @xmath43 on @xmath3 and @xmath2 quantitatively , by computing the reaction rate @xmath35 .",

    "now , we consider @xmath47 for a specific case with @xmath1 ; for all chemical species , the number of the reaction path from other chemical species and those to other chemical species are given a unique value @xmath3 .",
    "in such cases , the distribution of the chemical concentrations goes to uniform . in each time step",
    ", each molecule collides one molecule on average , and the probability that the molecule catalyzes the reaction from the collided molecule is @xmath96 .",
    "then , @xmath47 is given by @xmath96 .",
    "if the fluctuation of the number of the reaction paths for each chemical specie increases , the reaction from the chemical species which have small number of reaction paths limit the reaction rate . then , @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath96 in general .",
    "now , to study dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , we introduce the following scaling functions ; @xmath97 as a normalized reaction rate and @xmath98 . note that @xmath49 is nothing but the average molecular number of each chemical , which gives the average probability that each reaction path is catalyzed",
    "thus , @xmath98 gives the average number of the effective reaction paths in the network .",

    "in other words , as @xmath21 goes to zero , the normalized reaction rate seems to approach a step function with 0 for @xmath107 .",
    "this means that the catalytic reactions often freeze .",
    "some reaction paths are terminated frequently if @xmath104 , and only non - catalytic changes give dominant contributions to the reaction dynamics . on the other hand , for @xmath108 , all chemicals can react along the connected paths in the catalytic reaction network for most of time , so that the behavior at the continuum limit is valid , i.e. , @xmath109 . to sum up",

    "the behavior is characterized by switching over quasi - stationary states where some reaction paths are terminated effectively due to deficiency in molecule numbers .",
    "each quasi - stationary state is characterized by a smaller set of effective reaction networks .    the critical molecule number for this transition is shown to be proportional to the number of chemical species @xmath2 divided by the average number of reaction path per species @xmath3 , with a proportion coefficient , estimated to be @xmath105 in a limit with large @xmath2 . whether the number of molecules is large enough to be approximated by the continuous rate equation or not is thus determined by @xmath112 .",

    "log normal distributions of the fluctuations of chemical concentration in cells are reproduced@xcite .",
    "we may expect our results provide some insight to biological phenomena .    in the presented model , below the critical number of molecules ( or beyond the critical number of molecule species )",
    ", there appears intermittent transitions over several states , which leads to the change in the structure of effective reaction network .",

    "in the nutrient poor environment , some chemical species may be deficient in a cell .",
    "the discreteness induced transition studied here may be relevant to such switch in the effective network .",
    "recently , large phenotype fluctuations in isogenetic cells are reported in several organisms@xcite . in such cells , abundances of some molecule species",
    "are not so large ( 10 - 100 molecules ) while there exist more than 1000 chemical species@xcite .",
    "the intermittent switching induced by molecular deficiency may underlie such large fluctuations .",
    "last , we briefly discuss dependences of the transition on the network topology or a connecting distribution . we have confirmed that the value of @xmath103 as well as the peak ( or dip ) in @xmath39 and atf are almost unchanged , even if the reaction coefficients are distributed uniformly between @xmath38 ands @xmath14 , or take two distinct values , say 0.1 and 0.9 randomly . the results are not changed either , even if there are some chemical species that catalyze many reaction paths and those catalyzing only a few paths .    however , the value of @xmath103 can be shifted if the auto - catalytic productions are dominant .",
    "if the reaction to a chemical species is catalyzed by itself , its concentration can increase rapidly , which may decrease the number of the species at the upstream of this reaction towards zero . the probability that some molecule species goes extinct",
    "is increased , as has been recently reported for a simple reaction network of a few species @xcite .",
