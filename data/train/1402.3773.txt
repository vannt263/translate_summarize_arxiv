    "in the context of the standard model ( sm ) , self - interactions of gauge bosons are exactly determined by the @xmath10 gauge symmetry . for this reason",
    ", the measurement of these couplings plays an important role in finding out the gauge structure of the sm .",
    "any deviation of the triple and quartic couplings of the gauge bosons from the sm expectations would indicate the existence of new physics .",
    "investigation of new physics through effective lagrangian method is a well known approach .",
    "such an approach is described by high - dimensional operators which give rise to genuine quartic gauge couplings .",
    "these effective operators also do not cause new trilinear vertices .",
    "therefore , genuine quartic gauge couplings can be studied independently from trilinear couplings . imposing custodial @xmath11 and local @xmath12 symmetry , and",
    "if we restrict ourselves to charge conjugation and parity conserving interactions , the dimension 6 effective lagrangian for the @xmath0 couplings is defined by the operators @xcite    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 triplet , @xmath18 stands for the new physics energy scale , @xmath19 is the photon field strength tensor , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dimensionless anomalous coupling constants .",

    "the experimental bounds on the anomalous coupling parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 have been obtained at the lep by the l3 collaboration through the study of the process @xmath28 , and by the opal collaboration from the combination of the processes @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the bounds on quartic anomalous @xmath0 couplings from the l3 collaboration are @xcite :    @xmath31    @xmath32    more restrictive bounds are obtained by the opal collaboration @xcite :    @xmath33    @xmath34    all bounds are given at @xmath4 c.",
    "l ..    up to now , the anomalous quartic @xmath0 couplings at the linear @xmath35 colliders and its @xmath36 and @xmath37 options have been investigated via the processes @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 @xcite , @xmath42 @xcite , and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "these vertices have also been examined at hadron colliders through the processes @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 @xcite , @xmath48 @xcite , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the high center - of - mass energy and luminosity , the lhc is expected to answer some of the fundamental open questions in particle physics . however , for high precision measurements , a tev scale @xmath35 linear collider with extremely high luminosity and clean experimental environments must be built to complement the lhc .",
    "one of the most popularly envisaged linear collider is the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "the clic has been planned to operate at three different energy stages , with the basic parameters of these stages given in table i. the other well - known applications of linear colliders are to investigate new physics beyond the sm with the aid of @xmath50 and @xmath51 reactions .",
    "an almost real @xmath52 photon emitted from either of the incoming leptons can interact with the other lepton , and the process @xmath53 can take place , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , the photons emitted from both leptons can collide with each other , and the process @xmath55 can take place , as depicted by fig .",
    "photons emitted from leptons are described by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite . in the framework of epa ,",
    "since the emitted almost real photons have a low virtuality , they are assumed to be on mass shell",
    ". many examples of investigation of possible new physics beyond the sm through photon - induced reactions using epa are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the fundamental aim of the study presented here is to investigate the physics potential of the clic in probing anomalous quartic @xmath0 couplings via the reactions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the tree - level feynman diagrams for the processes @xmath1 , and the subprocesses @xmath57 , @xmath58 are shown in figs .",
    "@xmath5-@xmath59 . in the presence of the effective lagrangians in equations @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the processes @xmath1 and the subprocesses @xmath57 have only four feynman diagrams . as shown in figs .",
    "@xmath5-@xmath62 , while the top - left diagrams show the contribution coming from @xmath0 coupling , the other diagrams originate from sm electroweak processes . as seen from fig .",
    "@xmath59 , the subprocess @xmath58 has only a feynman diagram which consists of new physics . in this paper , we have used the comphep-4.5.1 program @xcite in order to obtain numerical estimates of the cross sections of the processes under study . in our work , only one of the anomalous coupling parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 is presumed to deviate from the sm at a time .",
    "the total cross sections for the processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 as functions of anomalous @xmath26 and @xmath27 couplings are plotted in figs .",
    "as the value of the total cross section involving @xmath26 coupling is greater than the value of the @xmath27 , we anticipate that the bounds on the @xmath26 parameter will be more stringent than the bounds on @xmath27 .",
    "the number of expected events in the sm for the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the integrated luminosity and @xmath67 is the sm cross section .",
    "in this study we restrict to the decays of the z bosons into @xmath68-@xmath69 and @xmath70-@xmath71 , which represent easily detectable and background - free channels .",
    "the branching ratio of the z boson pairs in the final states of both processes is @xmath72 .",
    "the sm background cross sections for the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given in table ii . here , we impose the acceptance cuts on the pseudorapidities @xmath73 and the transverse momentums @xmath74 gev , @xmath75 gev for the electron and the photon in the final state of both processes .",
    "on the other hand , the sm cross section of the process @xmath3 is quite small , because the subprocess @xmath76 is not allowed at the tree level .",
    "it is only allowed at loop level and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of a few events at the end of such a process would be an important sign of new physics beyond the sm .    in our study , we use two different analyses to evaluate the sensitivity to the anomalous @xmath0 couplings .",
    "first , we employ a simple one - parameter @xmath77 test when the number of sm events is greater than @xmath78 .",
    "this analysis only applies in the case of the process @xmath1 with center - of - mass energy of @xmath79 tev and integrated luminosity of @xmath80 fb@xmath7 since the sm event number is equal to @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath77 is defined as follows    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the total cross section in the presence of anomalous gauge couplings , @xmath84 is the statistical error and here @xmath85 is the number of events .    on the other hand , for all other processes in the study of the anomalous couplings we use a poisson distribution , due to the number of sm events being fewer than @xmath78 .",
    "sensitivity bounds are calculated by presuming the number of observed events to be equal to the sm prediction , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "the upper limits of the number of events @xmath87 at the @xmath4 c.l . can be obtained as follows @xcite    @xmath88    the value of upper limits @xmath87 can be determined with respect to the value of the number of observed events @xcite .",
    "the number of observed events @xmath89 and corresponding values for the upper limits @xmath87 at @xmath4 c.l . by using the poisson distribution for the processes @xmath1 and @xmath3 with different values of luminosity and center - of - mass energy are given in tables iii - iv . here ,",
    "the calculated values for @xmath89 are rounded to the nearest integer . for example , the number of observed events for the process @xmath90 with @xmath91 tev is obtained as @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 fb@xmath7 , respectively . both values of the number of observed events",
    "have been rounded to @xmath96 .",
    "for the process @xmath3 , for all center - of - mass energies and luminosities , the values of the upper limits is always @xmath5 , since the number of observed events is equal to @xmath96 .    the upper bounds of the number of events @xmath87 at the @xmath4 c.l .",
    "can be transformed into bounds on the anomalous couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in tables",
    "v - vii , we give the obtained one - dimensional bounds on anomalous couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 at @xmath4 c.l . for the processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 at selected values of integrated luminosity and center - of - mass energy . as can be seen in tables v - vii , in the case @xmath79 tev and @xmath97 fb@xmath7 of data ,",
    "the bounds on @xmath26 would be @xmath98 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath1 , @xmath99 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath2 , @xmath100 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath3 and @xmath27 would be @xmath101 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath1 , @xmath102 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath2 , @xmath103 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath3 .",
    "we can easily understand that these bounds are more restrictive than the best limits obtained from opal collaboration .",
    "in addition , in the case of the clic operates the maximum energy and luminosity , the bounds on @xmath26 would be @xmath104 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath1 , @xmath105 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath2 , @xmath106 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath3 and @xmath27 would be @xmath107 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath1 , @xmath108 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath2 , @xmath109 $ ] gev@xmath9 for @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the best bounds for @xmath26 and @xmath27 improve the sensitivity by up to a factor of @xmath110 and @xmath111 with respect to current experimental bounds , respectively .",
    "principally , it can be seen from a comparison of tables v - vii that the sensitivity to anomalous couplings rapidly increases when the center - of - mass energy and integrated luminosity of the processes increase .",
    "since the linear @xmath35 colliders and its @xmath50 and @xmath112 options have very clean experimental conditions and are mostly free from qcd backgrounds , measurements of the anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings with higher precision with respect to lhc can be obtained .",
    "the anomalous quartic gauge couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 are described by dimension @xmath63 effective quartic lagrangian .",
    "the total cross sections containing these couplings have a stronger energy dependence than the pure sm processes .",
    "therefore , having a high center - of - mass energy , the linear collider is extremely important for the determination of the anomalous quartic gauge couplings . for these reasons ,",
    "we study the processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 at the clic , with the z bosons decaying in @xmath35 and @xmath113 pairs , in order to obtain the sensitivities to anomalous quartic gauge couplings . among these processes , the best bounds on @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "couplings are obtained from the process @xmath1 , and they are at the order of @xmath8 gev@xmath9 . it has been shown that the bounds on anomalous couplings improve up to approximately @xmath114 times for @xmath26 and up to @xmath115 times for @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath3 process , due to the number of sm events being negligibly small , provides us an opportunity to examine directly anomalous quartic couplings .",
    "these results show that the clic is a suitable platform for probing of anomalous @xmath0 coupling in @xmath1 as well as @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes .",
