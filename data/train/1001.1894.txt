    "it is customary not to include the fixed points of @xmath7 in this structure .",
    "for instance , the permutation @xmath8 has 3 cycles , @xmath9 , so its cycle structure is @xmath10 ( and one fixed point which does not appear in this structure ) .",

    "@xmath26 is a markov chain on @xmath27 which converges to the uniform distribution @xmath28 on  @xmath27 when @xmath29 is even , and to the uniform distribution on @xmath30 when @xmath31 is odd . in any case",

    "this problem has a rather long history , which we now sketch . mixing times of markov chains",
    "were studied independently by aldous @xcite and by diaconis and shahshahani @xcite at around the same time , in the early 1980s .",
    "diaconis and shahshahani @xcite , in particular , establish the existence of what has become known as the _ cutoff phenomenon _ for the composition of random transpositions .",
    "random transpositions is perhaps the simplest example of a random walk on @xmath27 and is a particular case of the walks covered in this paper , arising when the conjugacy class @xmath45 contains exactly all transpositions .",
    "the authors of @xcite obtained a version of theorem [ t : mix ] for this particular case ( with explicit choices of @xmath64 for a given @xmath65 ) .",
    "as is the case here , the hard part of the result is the upper - bound ( [ tub ] ) . remarkably , their solution involved a connection with the representation theory of  @xmath27 , and uses rather delicate estimates on so - called character ratios .",
    "soon afterwards , a flurry of papers tried to generalize the results of @xcite in the direction we are taking in this paper , that is , when the step distribution is uniform over a fixed conjugacy class @xmath45 .",
    "however , the estimates on character ratios that are needed become harder and harder as @xmath29 increases .",
    "flatto , odlyzko and wales @xcite , building on earlier work of vershik and kerov @xcite , obtained finer estimates on character ratios and were able to show that mixing must occur before @xmath66 for @xmath29 fixed , thus giving another proof of the diaconis ",
    "shahshahani result when @xmath67 .",
    "( although this does not appear explicitly in @xcite , it is recounted in diaconis s book @xcite , page 44 . ) improving further the estimates on character ratios , roichman @xcite was able to prove a weak version of theorem [ t : mix ] , where it is shown that @xmath36 is small if @xmath68 for some large enough @xmath69 . in his result",
    ", @xmath29 is allowed to grow to infinity as fast as @xmath70 for any @xmath71 . to our knowledge , it is in @xcite that theorem [ t : mix ] first formally appears as a conjecture , although we have no doubt that it had been privately made before . ( the lower bound for random transpositions , which is based on counting the number of fixed points in @xmath34 , works equally well in this context and provides the conjectured correct answer in all cases . ) lulov @xcite dedicated his ph.d .",
    "thesis to the problem , and lulov and pak @xcite obtained a partial proof of the conjecture of roichman , in the case where @xmath29 is very large , that is , greater than @xmath72 .",
    "more recently , roussel @xcite and @xcite made some progress in the small @xmath29 case , working out the character ratios estimates to treat the case where @xmath73 .",
    "saloff - coste , in his survey article ( @xcite , section  9.3 ) discusses the sort of difficulties that arise in these computations and states the conjecture again .",
    "a summary of the results discussed above is also given .",

    "] , it suffices to look at the cycle structure of @xmath34 and check that if @xmath74 is the number of cycles of @xmath34 of size @xmath75 for every @xmath76 , and if @xmath77 then the total variation distance between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is close to 0 , where @xmath80 is the cycle distribution of a random permutation sampled from @xmath81 .",
    "we thus study the dynamics of the cycle distribution of @xmath34 , which we view as a certain coagulation  fragmentation chain . using ideas from schramm @xcite ,",
    "it can be shown that large cycles are at equilibrium much before @xmath43 , that is , at a time of order @xmath82 . very informally speaking , the idea of the proof is the following .",
    "we focus for a moment on the case @xmath83 of random transpositions , which is the easiest to explain .",
    "the process @xmath84 may be compared to an erds  rnyi random graph process @xmath85 where random edges are added to the graph at rate 1 , in such a way that the cycles of the permutation are subsets of the connected components of @xmath86 .",
    "schramm s result from @xcite then says that , if @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( so that @xmath86 has a giant component ) , then the macroscopic cycles within the giant component have relaxed to equilibrium . by an old result of erds and rnyi , it takes time @xmath89 for @xmath86 to be connected with probability greater than @xmath90 . by this point",
    "the giant component encompasses every vertex and thus , extrapolating schramm s result to this time , the macroscopic cycles of @xmath34 have the correct distribution at this point . a separate and somewhat more technical argument is needed to deal with small cycles .",
    "more formally , the proof of theorem [ t : mix ] thus proceeds in two main steps . in the first step , presented in section [ smallcycles ] and culminating in proposition [ prop - small ]",
    ", we show that after time @xmath91 , the distribution of _ small cycles _ is close ( in variation distance ) to the invariant measure , where a _ small cycle _ means that it is smaller than a suitably chosen threshold approximately equal to @xmath92 .",
    "this is achieved by combining a queueing - system argument ( whereby initial discrepancies are cleared by time slightly larger than @xmath43 and equilibrium is achieved ) with a priori rough estimates on the decay of mass in small cycles ( section [ subsec - verif ] ) . in the second step , contained in section [ sec - schramm ] , a variant of schramm s coupling from @xcite is presented , which allows us to couple the chain after time @xmath91 to a chain started from equilibrium , within time of order @xmath93 , if all small cycles agree initially .",
    "in this section we prove the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath94 be the number of cycles of size @xmath75 of the permutation @xmath34 , where @xmath84 evolves according to random @xmath2-cycles ( where @xmath95 ) , but does not necessarily start at the identity permutation .",
    "let @xmath96 denote independent poisson random variables with mean @xmath97 .",
    "fix @xmath98 and let @xmath99 be the closest dyadic integer to @xmath100 .",
    "we think of cycles smaller than @xmath101 as being small , and big otherwise .",
    "let @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 introduce the stopping time @xmath105 therefore , prior to @xmath106 , the total number of small cycles in each dyadic strip @xmath107 , @xmath108 @xmath109 never exceeds @xmath110 .",
    "[ p : step2 ] suppose that @xmath111 as @xmath112 , and that initially , @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , for some @xmath115 independent of @xmath116 or @xmath1 .",
    "then for any sequence @xmath117 such that @xmath118 as @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121    in particular , under the assumptions of proposition [ p : step2 ] , for any @xmath54 there is a @xmath122 such that for all @xmath1 large , @xmath123 in sections [ subsec - verif ] and [ subsec - conclusionrev ] , proposition [ p : step2 ] is applied to the chain after time roughly @xmath124 , at which point the initial conditions @xmath125 satisfy  ( [ assumptionstep2prime ] ) ( with high probability ) .",
    "proof of proposition [ p : step2 ] the proof of this proposition relies on the analysis of the dynamics of the small cycles , where each step of the dynamics corresponds to an application of a @xmath2-cycle , by viewing it as a coagulation  fragmentation process . to start with , note that every @xmath2-cycle may decomposed as a product of @xmath126 transpositions @xmath127 thus the application of a @xmath2-cycle may be decomposed into the application of @xmath126 transpositions : namely , applying @xmath128 is the same as first applying the transposition @xmath129 followed by @xmath130 and so on until @xmath131 .",
    "whenever one of those transpositions is applied , say @xmath132 , this can yield either a fragmentation or a coagulation , depending on whether @xmath133 and @xmath134 are in the same cycle or not at this time .",
    "if they are , say if @xmath135 ( where @xmath76 and  @xmath7 denotes the permutation at this time ) , then the cycle @xmath136 containing @xmath133 and  @xmath134 splits into @xmath137 and everything else , that is , @xmath138 . if they are in different cycles @xmath136 and @xmath139 then the two cycles merge .",
    "to track the evolution of cycles , we color the cycles with different colors ( blue , red or black ) according ( roughly ) to the following rules .",
    "the blue cycles will be the large ones , and the small ones consist of red and black .",
    "essentially , red cycles are those which undergo a `` normal '' evolution , while the black ones are those which have experienced some kind of error . by `` normal evolution , ''",
    "we mean the following : in a given step , one small cycle is generated by fragmentation of a blue cycle .",
    "it is the first small cycle that is involved in this step . in a later step of the random",
    "walk , this cycle coagulates with a large cycle and thus becomes large again .",
    "if at any point of this story , something unexpected happens ( e.g. , this cycle gets fragmented instead of coagulating with a large cycle , or coagulates with another small cycle ) we will color it black .",
    "in addition , we introduce ghost cycles to compensate for this sort of error .",
    "we now describe this procedure more precisely .",
    "we start by coloring every cycle of the permutation @xmath140 which is larger than @xmath141 blue .",
    "we denote by  @xmath142 the fraction of mass contained in blue cycles , that is , @xmath143 note that by definition of @xmath106 , @xmath144 for all @xmath145 .",
    "we now color the cycles which are smaller than @xmath101 either red or black according to the following dynamics .",
    "suppose we are applying a certain @xmath2-cycle @xmath146 , which we write as a product of @xmath126 transpositions @xmath147 ( note that we require that @xmath148 for @xmath149 ) .",
    "_ red cycles . _",
    "assume that a blue cycle is fragmented and one of the pieces is small , and that this transposition is the first one in the application of the @xmath2-cycle @xmath150 to involve a small cycle .",
    "in that case ( and only in that case ) , we color it red .",
    "red cycles may depart through coagulation or fragmentation . a coagulation with a blue cycle ,",
    "if it is the first in the step and no small cycles were created in this step prior to it , will be called _ lawful_. any other departure will be called _",
    "unlawful_. if a blue cycle breaks up in a  way that would create a red cycle and both cycles created are small ( which may happen if the size of the cycle is between @xmath101 and @xmath151 ) , then we color the smaller one red and the larger one black , with a random rule in the case of ties .",
    "_ black cycles .",
    "_ black cycles are created in one of two ways .",
    "first , any red cycle that departs in an unlawful fashion and stays small becomes black .",
    "further , if the transposition @xmath152 is not the first transposition in this step to create a small cycle from a blue cycle , or if it is but a previous transposition in the step involved a small cycle , then the small cycle(s ) created is colored black .",
    "now , assume that @xmath132 involves only cycles which are smaller than @xmath101 : this may be a fragmentation producing two new cycles , or a merging of two cycles producing one new cycle . in this case",
    ", we color the new cycle(s ) black , no matter what the initial color of the cycles , except if this operation is a coagulation _ and _ the size of this new cycle exceeds @xmath101 , in which case it is colored blue again .",
    "thus , black cycles are created through either coagulations of small parts or fragmentation of either small or large parts , but black cycles disappear only through coagulation .",
    "we aim to analyze the dynamics of the red and black system , and the idea is that the dynamics of this system are essentially dominated by that of the red cycles , where the occurrence of black cycles is an error that we aim to control .",
    "_ let @xmath153 be the number of red and black cycles , respectively , of size @xmath75 at time @xmath37 .",
    "it will be helpful to introduce another type of cycle , called ghost cycles , which are nonexisting cycles which we add for counting purposes : the point is that we do not want to touch more than one red cycle in any given step .",
    "thus , for any red cycle departing in an unlawful way , we compensate it by creating a ghost cycle of the same size . for instance , suppose two red cycles @xmath154 and @xmath155 coagulate ( this could form a blue or a  black cycle ) . then we leave in the place of @xmath154 and @xmath155 two ghost cycles @xmath156 and @xmath157 of sizes identical to @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "an exception to this rule is that if , during a step , a transposition creates a small red cycle by fragmentation of a blue cycle , and later within the same step this red cycle either is immediately fragmented again in the next transposition or coagulates with another red or black cycle and remains small , then it becomes black as above but we do not leave a ghost in its place .",
    "finally , we also declare that every ghost cycle of size @xmath75 is killed independently of anything else at an instantaneous rate which is precisely given by  @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is a random nonnegative number ( depending on the state of the system at time @xmath37 ) which will be defined below in ( [ mu ] ) and corresponds to the rate of lawful departures of red cycles .",
    "to summarize , we begin at time @xmath160 with all large cycles colored blue and all small cycles colored red . for every step consisting of @xmath2 transpositions",
    ", we run the following algorithm for the coloring of small cycles and creation of ghost cycles ( see table [ table1 ] ) .    ' '' ''    * if the transposition is a fragmentation , go to ( f ) ; otherwise , go to ( c ) . *",
    "if the fragmentation is of a small cycle @xmath128 of length @xmath161 , go to ( fs ) ; otherwise , go to ( fl ) .",
    "* color the resulting small cycles black .",
    "create a ghost cycle of length @xmath161 , except if @xmath128 was created in the previous transposition of the current step and is red .",
    "_ finish_. * if the fragmentation creates one or two small cycles , and this transposition is the first in the step to either create or involve a small cycle , color the smallest small cycle created red .",
    "all other small cycles created are colored black . do not create ghost cycles .",
    "_ finish_. * if the coagulation involves a blue cycle , go to ( cl ) ; otherwise , go to ( cs ) . *",
    "if the blue cycle coagulates with a red cycle , and this is not the first transposition in the step that involves a small cycle , then create a ghost cycle ; otherwise , do not create a ghost cycle .",
    "if a small cycle remains after the coagulation , it is colored black .",
    "if the coagulation involved two red cycles of size @xmath161 and @xmath162 , create two ghost cycles of sizes @xmath161 and @xmath162 , unless one of these two red cycles ( say of size @xmath162 ) was created in the current step , in which case create only one ghost cycle of size @xmath161 . _",
    "finish . _    ' '' ''    let @xmath163 denote the number of ghost cycles of size @xmath75 at time @xmath37 , and let @xmath164 , which counts the number of red and ghost cycles of size @xmath75 .",
    "our goal is twofold .",
    "first , we want to show that @xmath165 is close in total variation distance to @xmath166 and second , that at time @xmath167 the probability that there is any black cycle or a ghost cycle converges to 0 as @xmath112",
    ".    note that with our definitions , at each step at most one red cycle can be created , and at most one red cycle can disappear without being compensated by the creation of a ghost .",
    "furthermore these two events can not occur in the same step .",
    "[ l : yeq ] assume ( [ assumptionstep2 ] ) as well as ( [ assumptionstep2prime ] ) , and let @xmath167 be as in proposition [ p : step2 ] .",
    "then @xmath168    the idea is to observe that @xmath169 has approximately the following dynamics : @xmath170 and that @xmath171 , so that @xmath172 is approximately a system of @xmath173 queues where the arrival rate is @xmath174 and the departure rate of every customer is @xmath175 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of @xmath172 is thus approximately poisson with parameter the ratio of the two rates , that is , @xmath97 .",
    "the number of initial customers in the queues is , by assumption ( [ assumptionstep2 ] ) , small enough so that by time @xmath176 they are all gone , and thus the queue has reached equilibrium .",
    "we now make this heuristics precise .",
    "to increase @xmath169 by 1 , that is , to create a red cycle , one needs to specify the @xmath116th transposition , @xmath177 , of the @xmath2-cycle at which it is created .",
    "the first point @xmath178 of the @xmath2-cycle must fall somewhere in a blue cycle ( which has probability @xmath179 ) .",
    "say that @xmath180 , with @xmath154 a blue cycle . in order to create a cycle of size exactly @xmath75 at this transposition",
    ", the second point @xmath181 must fall at either of exactly _ two _ places within @xmath154 : either @xmath182 or @xmath183 .",
    "however , note that if @xmath184 and @xmath185 , then the next transposition is guaranteed to involve the newly formed cycle , either to reabsorb it in the blue cycles , or to turn into a black cycle through coalescence with another small cycle or fragmentation .",
    "either way , this newly formed cycle does not eventually lead to an increase in @xmath169 since by our conventions , we do not leave a ghost in its place . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath186 then the newly formed red cycle will stay on as a red or a ghost cycle in the next transpositions of the application of the cycle  @xmath128 .",
    "whether it stays as a ghost or a red cycle does not change the value of  @xmath169 , and therefore , this event leads to a net increase of @xmath169 by 1 .",
    "this is true for all of the first @xmath187 transpositions of the @xmath2-cycle @xmath128 , but not for the last one , where both @xmath188 and @xmath189 will create a red cycle of size  @xmath75 .",
    "it follows from this analysis that the total rate @xmath190 at which @xmath169 increases by 1 satisfies @xmath191 to get a lower bound , observe that for @xmath145 , @xmath192 at the beginning of the step .",
    "when a @xmath2-cycle is applied and we decompose it into elementary transpositions , the value @xmath142 for each of the transpositions may take different successive values which we denote by .",
    "however , note that at each such transposition , @xmath179 can only change by at most @xmath193 .",
    "thus it is also the case that for all @xmath177 , @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , the probability that a fragmentation of a blue cycle does not create any small cycle is also bounded below by @xmath195 it thus follows that the total rate @xmath190 is bounded below by @xmath196 of course , by this we mean that the @xmath197 are nonnegative jump processes whose jumps are of size @xmath198 , and that if @xmath199 is the filtration generated by the entire process up to time @xmath37 , then @xmath200 almost surely on the event @xmath201 . as for negative jumps , we have that for @xmath202 , @xmath203 where @xmath159 depends on the partition and satisfies the estimates @xmath204 where @xmath205 the reason for this is as follows . to decrease @xmath169 by 1 by decreasing @xmath206 , note that the only way to get rid of a red cycle without creating a ghost is to coagulate it with a blue cycle at the @xmath116th transposition , @xmath177 , with no other transpositions creating small cycles .",
    "the probability of this event is bounded above by @xmath207 and , with @xmath208 as above , bounded below by @xmath209 therefore , if in addition ghosts are each killed independently with rate @xmath159 as above , then ( [ jump- ] ) holds .",
    "more generally , if @xmath210 and @xmath211 are pairwise distinct integers , then we may consider the vector @xmath212 .",
    "if its current state is @xmath213 , then it may make transitions to @xmath214 where the two vectors @xmath215 and @xmath216 differ by exactly one coordinate ( say the @xmath116th one ) and @xmath217 ( since only one queue @xmath169 can change at any time step , thanks to our coloring rules ) .",
    "also , writing @xmath218 for the vector @xmath212 , we find @xmath219 these observations show that we can compare @xmath220 to a  system of independent markov queues @xmath221 with respect to a common filtration @xmath199 , with no simultaneous jumps almost surely , and such that the arrival rate of each @xmath169 is @xmath222 , and the departure rate of each client in @xmath169 is  @xmath223 .",
    "we may also define a system of queues @xmath224 by accepting every new client of @xmath225 with probability @xmath226 and rejecting it otherwise .",
    "subsequently , each accepted client tries to depart at a  rate , or when it departs in @xmath225 , whichever comes first .",
    "then one can construct all three processes @xmath224 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 on a  common probability space in such a way that @xmath229 for all @xmath230 .",
    "note that if @xmath231 denote independent poisson random variables with mean @xmath232 , then @xmath233 forms an invariant distribution for the system @xmath234 .",
    "let @xmath235 denote the system of markov queues @xmath225 started from its equilibrium distribution @xmath231 .",
    "then @xmath236 and @xmath237 can be coupled as usual by taking each coordinate to be equal after the first time that they coincide . in particular , once all the initial customers of @xmath225 and of @xmath238 have departed ( let us call @xmath239 this time ) , then the two processes @xmath228 and @xmath231 are identical .",
    "we now check that this happens before @xmath117 with high probability .",
    "it is an easy exercise to check this for @xmath238 so we focus on @xmath240 . to see this , note that by ( [ assumptionstep2prime ] ) , there are no more than @xmath241 customers in every strip @xmath242 initially if @xmath243",
    "moreover , each customer departs with rate at least @xmath244 when in this strip .",
    "thus the time @xmath245 it takes for all initial customers of @xmath246 in strip @xmath247 to depart is dominated by @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is a collection of i.i.d .",
    "standard exponential random variables .",
    "hence @xmath250 for larger strips we use the crude and obvious bound @xmath251 if @xmath252 . moreover , each customer departs at rate @xmath244 with @xmath253 .",
    "thus , in distribution , @xmath254 so that @xmath255 [ we are using here that @xmath256 for all @xmath257 large enough ] . since we obviously have @xmath258 , we conclude @xmath259 where @xmath260 depends solely on @xmath261 . by markov s inequality and since @xmath118",

    "the point @xmath542 designates a  size - biased sample from the partition @xmath557 and we will construct another point  @xmath558 , which will also be uniformly distributed on @xmath556 , to similarly select a size - biased sample from @xmath559 .",

    "this coupling has a number of remarkable properties which we summarize below .",
    "essentially , the total number of unmatched entries can only decrease , and furthermore it is very difficult to create small unmatched entries , as the smallest unmatched entry can only become smaller by a factor of at most  2.=1    in what follows , we often speak of the `` unmatched entries '' between two permutations , meaning that we associate to these permutations elements of  @xmath524 and identify matched parts in @xmath524 with matched cycles in the permutations .",
    "the translation between the two involves a factor @xmath1 concerning the size of the parts , and in all places it should be clear from the context whether we discuss parts in @xmath568 or cycles of partitions .",
    "[ l : coupling ] let @xmath569 be the size of the smallest unmatched entry in two partitions @xmath544 , let @xmath570 be the corresponding partitions after one transposition of the coupling and let @xmath571 be the size of the smallest unmatched entry in @xmath570 .",
    "assume that @xmath572 for some @xmath573 .",
    "then it is always the case that @xmath574 , and moreover , @xmath575 finally , the number of unmatched parts may only decrease .",
    "@xmath576since @xmath577 , it holds in particular that @xmath578 .",
    "proof of lemma [ l : coupling ] that the number of unmatched entries can only decrease is similar to the proof of lemma 3.1 in @xcite .",
    "( in fact it is simpler here , since that lemma requires looking at the total number of unmatched entries of size greater than @xmath65 . since in our discrete setup",
    "no entry can be smaller than @xmath579 we do not have to take this precaution . ) we continue to denote by @xmath317 the total number of parts in the range @xmath580 .",
    "the only case that @xmath569 can decrease is if there is a fragmentation of an unmatched entry , since matched entries must fragment in exactly the same way .",
    "now , note that the coupling is such that when an unmatched entry is selected and is fragmented , then all subsequent pieces are either greater or equal to @xmath581 ( where @xmath133 is the size of the smaller of the two selected unmatched entries ) , or are matched .",
    "moreover , for such a fragmentation to occur , one must select the lowest unmatched entry ( this has probability at most @xmath582 , since there may be several unmatched entries with size  @xmath569 ) , and then fragment it , which has probability at most @xmath583 , and thus @xmath584 .",
    "since @xmath585 , this completes the proof .",
    "we have described the basic step of a ( random ) transposition in the coupling .",
    "the step corresponding to a random @xmath2-cycle @xmath586 is obtained by taking @xmath587 , generating @xmath588 as in the coupling above ( corresponding to the choice of @xmath589 ) , rearranging and taking @xmath590 to correspond to the location of @xmath588 after the rearrangement , drawing new @xmath588 ( corresponding to @xmath591 ) and so on . in doing so , we are disregarding the constraint that no repetitions are present in @xmath24 . however , as it turns out , we will be interested in an evolution lasting at most @xmath592 and the expected number of times that a violation of this constraint occurs during this time is bounded by @xmath593 , which converges to @xmath160 as @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we can in what follows disregard this violation of the constraint",
    ".    now , start with two configurations @xmath594 such that @xmath595 is the element of @xmath524 associated with a random uniform permutation .",
    "assume also that initially , the small parts of @xmath596 and @xmath595 ( i.e. , those that are smaller than @xmath101 , the closest dyadic integer to @xmath517 ) , are exactly identical , and that they have the same parity . as we will now see , at time @xmath597 , @xmath598 and @xmath599 will be coupled , with high probability .",
    "note also that , since initially all the parts that are smaller than @xmath101 are matched , the initial number of unmatched entries can not exceed @xmath600 , and this may only decrease with time by lemma  [ l : coupling ] .    [",
    "l : mass small ] in the next @xmath597 units of time , the random permutation @xmath522 never has more than a fraction @xmath601 of the total mass in parts smaller than @xmath92 , with high probability .",
    "the proof is the same as that of proposition [ rest ] , only simpler because the initial number of small clusters is within the required range .",
    "we omit further details .",
    "[ this can also be seen by computing the probability that a given uniform permutation @xmath519 has more than a fraction @xmath602 of the total mass in parts smaller than @xmath92 , and summing over @xmath603 steps . ]",
    "[ l : unmatched large ] in the next @xmath597 units of time , every unmatched part of the permutations is greater than or equal to @xmath604 , with high probability .",
    "recall that the total number of unmatched parts can never increase .",
    "suppose the smallest unmatched part at time @xmath605 is of scale @xmath116 ( i.e. , of size in @xmath242 ) , and let @xmath606 be this scale .",
    "then , when touching this part , the smallest scale it could go to is @xmath607 , by the properties of the coupling ( see lemma  [ l : coupling ] ) .",
    "this happens with probability at most @xmath608 . on the other hand , with the complementary probability ,",
    "this part experiences a coagulation .",
    "and with reasonable probability , what it coagulates with is larger than itself , so that it will jump to scale @xmath609 or larger . to compute this probability , note that since this is the smallest unmatched part , all smaller parts are matched and thus have a total mass controlled by lemma  [ l : mass small ] .",
    "in particular , on an event of high probability , this fraction of the total mass is at most @xmath610 .",
    "it follows that with probability at least @xmath611 , the part jumps to scale at least @xmath609 , and with probability at most @xmath612 , to scale @xmath607 .",
    "now , when this part jumps to scale at least @xmath609 , this does not necessarily mean that the _ smallest _ unmatched part is in scale at least @xmath609 , since there may be several small unmatched parts in scale @xmath116 .",
    "however , there can never be more than @xmath613 such parts . if an unmatched piece in scale @xmath116 is touched , we declare it a success if it moves to scale @xmath609 ( which has probability at least @xmath611 , given that it is touched ) and a failure if it goes to scale @xmath607 ( which has probability at most @xmath614 ) .",
    "if @xmath613 successes occur before any failure occurs at scale  @xmath116 , we say that a _ good success _ has occurred , and then we know that no unmatched cycle can exist at scale smaller than @xmath116 .",
    "call the complement of a good success a _ potential failure _ ( which thus includes the cases of both a real failure and a success which is not good ) .",
    "the probability of a potential failure at scale @xmath116 is at most @xmath615 , which is bounded above by @xmath616 .",
    "let @xmath617 be the times at which the smallest unmatched part changes scale , with @xmath618 being the first time the smallest unmatched part is of scale @xmath619 where .",
    "let @xmath620 denote the scale of the smallest unmatched part at time @xmath621 , and let @xmath622 be such that @xmath623 .",
    "introduce a birth ",
    "death chain on the integers , denoted @xmath624 , such that @xmath625 and @xmath626 and @xmath627 set @xmath628 , and an analysis of the birth  death chain defined by ( [ may27 ] ) and ( [ may27a ] ) gives that @xmath629 ( see , e.g. , theorem ( 3.7 ) in chapter 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath630 decays as an exponential in @xmath631 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath632 , it follows that @xmath633 as @xmath32 . on the other hand , between times  @xmath37 and @xmath634",
    ", the process @xmath635 may have made at most @xmath636 moves with overwhelming probability .",
    "this implies that @xmath637 with high probability throughout @xmath638 $ ] .",
    "_ end of the proof of theorem _ [ t : mix ] .",
    "we now are going to prove that , after @xmath639 steps , there are no more unmatched parts with high probability .",
    "the basic idea is that , on the one hand , the number of unmatched parts may never increase , and on the other hand , it does decrease frequently enough . since each unmatched",
    "part is greater than @xmath604 during this time , any given pair of unmatched parts is merging at rate roughly @xmath640 .",
    "there are initially no more than @xmath613 unmatched parts , so after @xmath641 steps , no more unmatched part remains with high probability .    to be precise , assume that there are @xmath642 unmatched parts",
    "let @xmath643 be the time to decrease the number of unmatched parts from @xmath642 to @xmath644 .",
    "observe that , for parity reasons ( @xmath513 and @xmath519 must have the same parity of number of parts at all times ) , @xmath642 is always even .",
    "note also that @xmath645 is impossible , so @xmath642 is at least 4 .",
    "assume to start with that both copies have at least 2 unmatched parts .",
    "then , at rate greater than @xmath646 we pick an unmatched part in the first point @xmath647 for the @xmath2-cycle .",
    "since there are at least 2 unmatched parts in each copy , let @xmath648 be the interval of @xmath534 corresponding to a second unmatched part in the copy that contains the larger of the two selected ones .",
    "then @xmath649 , and moreover when @xmath542 falls in @xmath648 , we are guaranteed that a coagulation is going to occur in both copies .",
    "we interpret this event as a success , and declare every other possibility a failure .",
    "hence if @xmath418 is a  geometric random variable with success probability @xmath646 , and @xmath650 are i.i.d .",
    "exponentials with mean @xmath651 , the total amount of time before a  success occurs is dominated by @xmath652 .",
    "if , however , one copy ( say @xmath513 ) has only one unmatched part , then one first has to break that component , which takes at most an exponential random variable with rate @xmath653 .",
    "note that the other copy must have had at least  3 unmatched parts , so after breaking the big one , both copies have now at least two unmatched copies and we are back to the preceding case .",
    "it follows from this analysis that in any case , @xmath643 is dominated by @xmath654 and so @xmath655 .",
    "now , let @xmath656 and let @xmath657 .",
