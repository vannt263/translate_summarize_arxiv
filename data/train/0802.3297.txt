    "the phenomenology of structural and spin glasses has much in common : no static long - range order , aging relaxation , heterogeneous dynamics , etc  @xcite . while a precise and unambiguous connection between these two problems still lacks , the possibility that such relation exists dates back to the work by kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes  @xcite , who proposed a connection between structural glasses and the p - spin disordered model .",
    "more recently , tarzia and moore  @xcite have paralleled the phenomenology of structural glasses to that of an edwards - anderson model in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "one of the main hurdles in making a direct real space connection between these two problems is that spin glass models are defined on a lattice , while the particles comprising structural glasses are itinerant .",
    "supercooled liquids and glasses are usually described within the lagrangian formulation , where one tracks the position of individual particles as a function of time .",
    "natural quantities computed within this frame of reference are mean - square displacement and self - diffusion of these particles .",
    "heterogeneous dynamics can be probed , for example , by studying quantities such as mobility within prescribed boxes ; however , such fixed regions serve this purpose just for a certain time , as particles move in and out of these boxes if one waits for long enough . in contrast , studying local dynamics in a spin glass presents no such complication , as spins remain fixed to their sites at all times , and all that changes is the spin orientation as function of time . therefore ,",
    "if one is to construct a simple description of particle systems that could actually be used in analyzing real experimental data from the point of view of a spin glass , one must abandon the lagrangian formulation .",
    "we propose an eulerian analysis of the dynamics of interacting particle systems .",
    "the proposal consists in transforming the data of numerical simulations or confocal microscopy experiments , usually presented in the lagrangian representation as time - dependent positions and velocities of distinguishable particles  @xcite , into time - dependent occupation numbers of finite volume pixels at fixed positions in space . in this way",
    ", we divide the simulation or experimental fixed volume box containing the particles into pixels located at sites labeled by @xmath0 , and assign a ` spin ' , @xmath1 , depending on whether a ` piece ' of the particle falls within the pixel or not .",
    "the data treatment here proposed allows one to make close contact with spin ( disordered or constrained ) models .",
    "we divide the experimental box in cubic pixels of linear size @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the radius of the particles and @xmath4 is a parameter , typically with @xmath5 .",
    "the number of pixels is then @xmath6 with @xmath7 the total volume of the experimental box ( we focus throughout the paper on the @xmath8 case relevant to the experiments analyzed below ) .",
    "the simplest definition of the spin variable is such that @xmath9 whenever a particle ( independently of which one it is ) overlaps the @xmath10-th pixel , and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "with such a definition , though , the magnetization density is non - zero , @xmath12 , at a generic volume fraction @xmath13 .",
    "to work at zero magnetization density and make closer contact with usual spin ( glass ) problems , we shrink the particle size to an effective radius @xmath14 such that the covered volume is @xmath15  @xcite .    an efficient algorithm that maps particle positions into spin variables works as follows .",
    "first , one constructs the grid of pixels and sets all spins to @xmath11 for all @xmath10 .",
    "next , one reads the particle centers from the data file and sets to @xmath16 the spin variables of the pixels around the center of each particle .",
    "one thus avoids having to go over all sites in the lattice and to compute distances between particle centers .",
    "this procedure is repeated at each time step .",
    "the data set has now been transformed into spin values and all interesting correlation functions in the spin realization inform us about the dynamics of the particle system .",
    "the spin variable is naturally related to an occupation number , by @xmath17 , and then to a density .",
    "we stress here that , in this construction , these densities are not coarse grained quantities built by looking at distances larger than the particle size , but instead the other way around , by looking at distances of the order and below the particle size . within this construction ,",
    "the parallel with the spin - glass problem is also clear : a short - ranged equal - time spin - spin correlation function corresponds to a short - ranged particle density order , etc .",

    "the reason why the correlation lengths in the glass are shorter than the ones in the supercooled liquid at the available times is that the glass is still far out of equilibrium and correlations have not propagated far in the sample yet .",

    "we computed correlation functions and extracted a correlation length from confocal microscopy data of supercooled and glassy samples and we found remarkably similar results to the ones obtained with numerical simulations of spin models .",
    "one advantage of our analysis method is that it does not rely on tracking individual particles over time .",
