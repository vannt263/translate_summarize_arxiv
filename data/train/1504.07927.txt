    "since the realization that the strong curvature singularity arising in the past of our universe in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models may not be avoided in generic solutions of the einstein gravity with matter in the form of an ideal fluid ( only its type changes from an isotropic one to the generic bkl vacuum singularity ) , there were many attempts to construct solutions avoiding this singularity by having at least one bounce at some high value of curvature either using more complicated field - theoretical models of matter or by modifying gravity . the simplest example to obtain one bounce in a set of solutions having a nonzero measure in the space of initial conditions",
    "is presented by a massive scalar field in a closed ( i.e. positively spatially curved ) flrw universe  @xcite .",
    "this does not remove the curvature singularity in a generic solution , even in the class of flrw models , but shifts it to the past , beyond any given finite number of bounces of the scale factor .",
    "non - singular flrw solutions with an infinite number of bounces exist , too , but they are degenerate : they have a zero measure in the space of initial conditions  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this occurs because a minimally coupled scalar field with a non - negative potential can violate the strong energy condition , but not the weak and null ones .",
    "however , having a bounce due to a positive spatial curvature requires severe fine tuning of initial conditions before the contraction stage in the past , see e.g. the calculations of the measure of those ones leading to a bounce in the above mentioned cosmological model in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "that is why it is much more interesting to obtain a non - degenerate bounce in flrw models in the absence of spatial curvature .",
    "previously known examples of such flrw models are based on such radical modifications of general relativity ( gr ) as theories with scalar  @xcite or tensor ghosts , loop quantum gravity ( see e.g. @xcite ) or gravity described by an effectively non - local lagrangian  ( see e.g.@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite for a recent review ) . by contrast , in our paper we would like to restrict ourselves to the well - known and very modest modification of gr - scalar - tensor gravity without ghosts . on the other hand , we want to abandon the common assumption that the scalar field potential @xmath0 in this gravity theory is non - negative , we will even consider the case when it is unbounded from below . in section 2 ,",
    "the bouncing model is presented and general equations and results are given .",
    "in section 3 , the existence of physically viable bouncing solutions is shown and their behaviour is studied in details .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a universe where gravity is described by scalar - tensor theory .",
    "the lagrangian density in the jordan frame of the gravitational sector is given by [ l ] l =  .",

    "the theory is ghost - free provided @xmath6 .",
    "we consider further spatially flat flrw universes with metric @xmath7 yielding the following modified friedmann equations -3 f h^2 + 12 z  ^2 - 3 h + u & = & 0  , [ fr1 ] + 2 f + z  ^2 + - h & = & 0  .",

    "surprisingly , while we arrived at this model by requiring that a combination of , and , without derivation with respect to @xmath9 , be zero , this model has been considered in the past in completely different contexts ( see e.g. @xcite ) . thus corresponds to a massless scalar field conformally coupled to einstein gravity with an interaction potential @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the energy - momentum tensor of the field @xmath10 is the sum of `` dark '' radiation with a negative energy density and a cosmological constant .    as a result ,",

    "let us finally note that the bounce disappears for @xmath40 .",
    "in spite of the fact that we have obtained an explicit closed form expression for @xmath41 we will study the behaviour of the bouncing solution by applying the qualitative theory of differential equations . this will provide us with a more intuitive and direct approach and will enable us to obtain results about the qualitative behaviour of our system otherwise difficult to find from . solving for the wave equation recast into the form + 3 h + 4 c ( ^2 - ^2 ) = 0  , [ ddphi2 ] where @xmath42 , and evaluating at the bounce 12 _ 0 ^ 2 - c ( _ 0 ^ 4 - _ 0,min^4 ) = 0  , [ ic ] where @xmath43 , our system is automatically solved .",

    "these results imply in particular that had we chosen @xmath83 , @xmath10 would eventually enter the unphysical domain @xmath84 , so this choice is not allowed .",

    "this minimum must be larger that @xmath85 as a direct consequence of ( [ ddphi2 ] ) .",

    "in contrast , once we find some @xmath53 value which yields a solution tending to @xmath107 , we can vary @xmath53 in a neighbourhood of this value and still go to the fixed point @xmath110 .    by continuity ,",

    ", the solution will tend to @xmath85 .",
    "so this solution which tends to the saddle point is the separatrix which separates the two types of behaviours .",
    "hence for given parameters @xmath123 , @xmath15 and @xmath13 satisfying , the two types of behaviours are possible provided the existence of the separatrix .",
    "determination of the initial value @xmath120 yielding the separatrix is a well - known problem in the theory of ordinary differential equations , known as the connexion problem @xcite . for given values of the parameters of the system ,",

    "we have the obvious corresponding change in and .",
    "let us consider next the possibility to have a viable bounce when @xmath2 in the absence of radiation .",
    "if we want to keep the conformal invariance , the absence of ghosts ( @xmath140 ) and the existence of a bounce , we are led to the following ansatz : f_z=-1 ( ) = - f_z=1 ( )  u_z=-1 ( ) = - u_z=1 ( )  , [ z-1 ] with the parameters @xmath141 still positive .",

    "however , the crucial difference is that the domain of physical validity differs in both cases : now all values @xmath146 satisfy @xmath147 . at the bounce ,",
    "it is seen from that the potential must satisfy @xmath148 yielding in this case too @xmath149 .    up to these differences , we can essentially repeat the analysis performed for @xmath1 .",

    ", we now obtain < _ 0,min <  .[int ] if @xmath154 , @xmath83 implies @xmath155 while @xmath56 can in principle produce two possible behaviours namely @xmath116 ( in that case @xmath156 ) or @xmath157 , the latter being unviable",
    ". the first possibility can not occur . indeed with @xmath56",
    ", some initial values above as well as below @xmath120 would tend to zero .",
    "but the particular value @xmath120 must separate two different behaviours , hence this is not possible .",

    "it is interesting that while a viable bounce can exist for @xmath2 with a potential bounded from below , it has measure zero in the initial conditions , only one particular set of initial conditions at the bounce is acceptable .",

    "the stable solutions lead to the general relativity limit if we assign to the bare gravitational constant @xmath161 its numerical value in gr .",
    "consistency of our model requires then the inequality @xmath162 .",
    "if we want to embed our model in a realistic cosmology , this attractive feature is even reinforced by the possibility to add a radiation component to our bouncing model .",
    "further , due to the invariance of the equations under the change @xmath163 , the solutions for @xmath70 are obtained from those found for @xmath164 changing the sign of @xmath165 .",

    "still , starting with regular initial values at @xmath166 , it is possible to have a bouncing universe regular in the future .",
    "note that a solution symmetric around the bounce requires @xmath167 which will diverge both in the past and in the future .",
    "it is well known that a bounce in the early universe can cure many of the problems occurring in big bang cosmology besides of course avoiding the big bang singularity itself . without exploring further this scenario ,",
    "we have shown that surprisingly such a bounce can occur for a flrw flat universe within one of the oldest and best understood alternatives to gr in a model tending dynamically to gr after the bounce .",
