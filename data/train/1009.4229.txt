    "the bfkl nll calculation including the @xmath2 evolution via the renormalisation group equation leads to a good description of the h1 data on the full range .",
    "we note that the higher order corrections are small when @xmath31 , when the bfkl effects are supposed to dominate .",

    "mueller navelet jets are ideal processes to study bfkl resummation effects  @xcite .",
    "two jets with a large interval in rapidity and with similar tranverse momenta are considered . a typical observable to look for bfkl effects",
    "is the measurement of the azimuthal correlations between both jets .",
    "the dglap prediction is that this distribution should peak towards @xmath35 - ie jets are back - to - back- whereas multi - gluon emission via the bfkl mechanism leads to a smoother distribution .",
    "the relevant variables to look for azimuthal correlations are the following : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the jet rapidities and transverse momenta .",
    "the azimuthal correlation for bfkl reads : @xmath39 where in the nll bfkl framework , @xmath40 and @xmath6 is the effective resummed kernel .",
    "computing the different @xmath41 at nll for the resummation schemes s3 and s4 allowed us to compute the azimuthal correlations at nll . as expected , the @xmath42 dependence is less flat than for bfkl ll and is closer to the dglap behaviour @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figlhc ] , we display the observable @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 , for lhc kinematics .",
    "the results are displayed for different values of @xmath45 and at both ll and nll accuracy using the s4 resummation scheme . in general , the @xmath44 spectra are peaked around @xmath46 which is indicative of jet emissions occuring back - to - back .",
    "in addition the @xmath44 distribution flattens with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "note the change of scale on the vertical axis which indicates the magnitude of the nll corrections with respect to the ll - bfkl results .",
    "the nll corrections slow down the azimuthal angle decorrelations for both increasing @xmath45 and @xmath48 deviating from @xmath49 we also studied the @xmath48 dependence of our prediction which is quite weak  @xcite and the scale dependence of our results by modifying the scale @xmath2 to either @xmath50 or @xmath51 and the effect on the azimuthal distribution is of the order of 20% .",
    "the effect of the energy conservation in the bfkl equation  @xcite is large when @xmath48 goes away from 1 .",
    "the effect is to reduce the effective value of @xmath52 between the jets and thus the decorrelation effect .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that this effect is negligible when @xmath48 is close to 1 where this measurement will be performed .",
    "a measurement of the cross - section @xmath53 at the tevatron ( run 2 ) or the lhc will allow for a detailed study of the bfkl qcd dynamics since the dglap evolution leads to much less jet angular decorrelation ( jets are back - to - back when @xmath48 is close to 1 )",
    ". in particular , measurements with values of @xmath45 reaching 8 or 10 will be of great interest , as these could allow to distinguish between bfkl and dglap resummation effects and would provide important tests for the relevance of the bfkl formalism .    to illustrate this result",
    ", we give in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the azimuthal correlation in the cdf acceptance .",
    "the cdf collaboration installed the mini - plugs calorimeters aiming for rapidity gap selections in the very forward regions and these detectors can be used to tag very forward jets .",
    "a measurement of jet @xmath32 with these detectors would not be possible but their azimuthal segmentation allows a @xmath7 measurement . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display the jet azimuthal correlations for jets with a @xmath34 gev and @xmath546 , 8 , 10 and 11 .",
    "for @xmath5411 , we notice that the distribution is quite flat , which would be a clear test of the bfkl prediction .",
    "in this section , we describe another possible measurement which can probe bfkl resummation effects and we compare our predictions with existing d0 and cdf measurements  @xcite .",
    "the production cross section of two jets with a gap in rapidity between them reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total energy of the collision , @xmath57 the transverse momentum of the two jets , @xmath58 and @xmath59 their longitudinal fraction of momentum with respect to the incident hadrons , @xmath60 the survival probability , and @xmath61 the effective parton density functions  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity gap between the two jets is @xmath62    the cross section is given by @xmath63 in terms of the @xmath64 scattering amplitude @xmath65    in the following , we consider the high energy limit in which the rapidity gap @xmath45 is assumed to be very large .",
    "the bfkl framework allows to compute the @xmath64 amplitude in this regime , and the result is known up to nll accuracy @xmath66\\exp\\left\\{\\bar\\alpha(e_t^2)\\chi_{eff}[2p,{\\gamma},\\bar\\alpha(e_t^2 ) ] \\delta \\eta\\right\\ } } { [ ( { \\gamma}-1/2)^2-(p-1/2)^2][({\\gamma}-1/2)^2-(p+1/2)^2 ] }   \\label{jgjnll}\\ ] ] with the complex integral running along the imaginary axis from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and with only even conformal spins contributing to the sum , and @xmath69 the running coupling .",
    "let us give some more details on formula [ jgjnll ] .",
    "the nll - bfkl effects are phenomenologically taken into account by the effective kernels @xmath70 .",
    "the nll kernels obey a _ consistency condition _ which allows to reformulate the problem in terms of @xmath71 the effective kernel @xmath72 is obtained from the nll kernel @xmath73 by solving the implicit equation @xmath74 as a solution of the consistency condition as it was also performed for forward jets .    in this study",
    ", we performed a parametrised distribution of @xmath75 so that it can be easily implemented in the herwig monte carlo  @xcite since performing the integral over @xmath11 in particular would be too much time consuming in a monte carlo .",
    "the implementation of the bfkl cross section in a monte carlo is absolutely necessary to make a direct comparison with data .",
    "namely , the measurements are sensititive to the jet size ( for instance , experimentally the gap size is different from the rapidity interval between the jets which is not the case by definition in the analytic calculation ) .",
    "let us first notice that the sum over all conformal spins is absolutely necessary .",
    "considering only @xmath76 in the sum of equation  [ jgjnll ] leads to a wrong normalisation and a wrong jet @xmath57 dependence , and the effect is more pronounced as @xmath52 diminishes .",
    "the d0 collaboration measured the jet gap jet cross section ratio with respect to the total dijet cross section , requesting for a gap between -1 and 1 in rapidity , as a function of the second leading jet @xmath57 , and @xmath52 between the two leading jets for two different low and high @xmath57 samples ( 15@xmath7720 gev and @xmath7830 gev ) . to compare with theory , we compute the following quantity @xmath79 in order to take into account the nlo corrections on the dijet cross sections , where @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the bfkl nll and the dijet cross section implemented in herwig .",
    "the nlo qcd cross section was computed using the nlojet++ program  @xcite .    the comparison with d0 data  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "we find a good agreement between the data and the bfkl calculation .",
    "it is worth noticing that the bfkl nll calculation leads to a better result than the bfkl ll one ( note that the best description of data is given by the bfkl ll formalism for @xmath76 but it does not make sense theoretically to neglect the higher spin components and this comparison is only made to compare with previous ll bfkl calculations ) .    the comparison with the cdf data  @xcite as a function of the average jet @xmath57 and the difference in rapidity between the two jets is shown in fig .",
    "6 , and the conclusion remains the same : the bfkl nll formalism leads to a better description than the bfkl ll one .      using the same formalism , and assuming a survival probability of 0.03 at the lhc , it is possible to predict the jet gap jet cross section at the lhc . while both ll and nll bfkl formalisms lead to a weak jet @xmath57 or @xmath52 dependence , the normalisation is found to be quite different ( see fig .",
    "7 ) leading to higher cross section for the bfkl nll formalism .",
    "in the third part of this report , we discuss a completely different topic , namely the possibility to probe anomalous quartic couplings between photons and @xmath83 or @xmath84 bosons at the lhc with an unprecedent precision using forward detectors to be installed in cms and atlas experiments  @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics",
    ", the couplings of fermions and gauge bosons are constrained by the gauge symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "the measurement of @xmath83 and @xmath84 boson pair productions via the exchange of two photons allows to provide directly stringent tests of one of the most important and least understood mechanism in particle physics , namely the electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian gauge nature of the sm predicts the existence of quartic couplings @xmath0 between the @xmath83 bosons and the photons which can be probed directly at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the quartic coupling to the @xmath84 boson @xmath85 is not present in the sm .",
    "quartic anomalous couplings between the photon and the @xmath84 or @xmath83 bosons are specially expected to occur in higgsless or extradimension models  @xcite .      the process that we intend to study is the @xmath83 pair production shown in fig .",
    "8 induced by the exchange of two photons  @xcite .",
    "it is a pure qed process in which the decay products of the @xmath83 bosons are measured in the central detector and the scattered protons leave intact in the beam pipe at very small angles , contrary to inelastic collisions .",
    "since there is no proton remnant the process is purely exclusive ; only @xmath83 decay products populate the central detector , and the intact protons can be detected in dedicated detectors located along the beam line far away from the interaction point .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath86 process which proceeds through two - photon exchange is calculated as a convolution of the two - photon luminosity and the total cross section @xmath87 .",
    "the total two - photon cross section is 95.6 fb .",
    "all considered processes ( signal and background ) were produced using the forward physics monte carlo  @xcite ( fpmc ) generator .",
    "the aim of fpmc is to produce different kinds of processes such as inclusive and exclusive diffraction , photon - exchange processes .",
    "fpmc was interfaced to as fast simulation of the atlas detector  @xcite . to reduce the amount of considered background",
    ", we only use leptonic ( electrons and muons ) decays of @xmath84 and @xmath83 bosons .",
    "the following backgrounds were considered : @xmath88  two - photon dilepton production , dpe@xmath89 - dilepton production through double pomeron exchange , dpe@xmath90  diboson production through double pomeron exchange .",
    "after simple cuts to select exclusive @xmath83 pairs decaying into leptons , such as a cut on the proton momentum loss of the proton ( @xmath91 )  we assume the protons to be tagged in the atlas forward physics detectors  @xcite  , on the transverse momentum of the leading and second leading leptons at 25 and 10 gev respectively , on @xmath92 gev , @xmath93 between leading leptons , and @xmath94 gev , the diffractive mass reconstructed using the forward detectors , the background is found to be less than 1.7 event for 30 fb@xmath95 for a sm signal of 51 events . in this channel ,",
    "a 5 @xmath96 discovery of the standard model @xmath97 process is possible after 5 fb@xmath95 .",
    "the parameterization of the quartic couplings based on @xcite is adopted .",
    "we concentrate on the lowest order dimension operators which have the correct lorentz invariant structure and obey the @xmath98 custodial symmetry in order to fulfill the stringent experimental bound on the @xmath99 parameter .",
    "the lowest order interaction lagrangians which involve two photons are dim-6 operators .",
    "the following expression for the effective quartic lagrangian is used @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 are the parametrized new coupling constants and the new scale @xmath103 is introduced so that the lagrangian density has the correct dimension four and is interpreted as the typical mass scale of new physics . in the above formula , we allowed the @xmath83 and @xmath84 parts of the lagrangian to have specific couplings , i.e. @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) and similarly @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) .",
    "the @xmath108 and @xmath109 two - photon cross sections rise quickly at high energies when any of the anomalous parameters are non - zero .",
    "the cross section rise has to be regulated by a form factor which vanishes in the high energy limit to construct a realistic physical model of the bsm theory .",
    "we therefore modify the couplings by form factors that have the desired behavior , i.e. they modify the coupling at small energies only slightly but suppress it when the center - of - mass energy @xmath110 increases .",
    "the form of the form factor that we consider is the following @xmath111 where @xmath112=2 , and @xmath1132 tev .    the cuts to select quartic anomalous gauge coupling @xmath108 events are similar as the ones we mentioned in the previous section , namely @xmath91 for the tagged protons , @xmath114 20 gev , @xmath115 between the two leptons .",
    "in addition , a cut on the @xmath32 of the leading lepton @xmath116 gev and on the diffractive mass @xmath117 gev are requested since anomalous coupling events appear at high mass .",
    "fig  9 displays the @xmath32 distribution of the leading lepton for signal and the different considered backgrounds .",
    "after these requirements , we expect about 0.7 background events for an expected signal of 17 events if the anomalous coupling is about four order of magnitude lower than the present lep limit ( @xmath118 10@xmath119 ) for a luminosity of 30 fb@xmath95 .",
    "the strategy to select anomalous coupling @xmath109 events is analogous and the presence of three leptons or two like sign leptons are requested .",
    "table 1 gives the reach on anomalous couplings at the lhc for a luminosity of 30 and 200 fb@xmath95 compared to the present opal limits  @xcite .",
    "we note that we can gain almost four orders of magnitude in the sensitivity to anomalous quartic gauge couplings compared to lep experiments , and it is possible to reach the values expected in higgsless or extra - dimension models which are of the order of 5 10@xmath119 .",
    "the tagging of the protons using the atlas forward physics detectors is the only method at present to test such small values of quartic anomalous couplings and thus to probe the higgsless models in a clean way .",
    "the reach on anomalous triple gauge couplings is much less improved at the lhc compared to lep experiments  @xcite .    to conclude , the atlas forward physics program ( and the cms one )",
    "will allow to study higgsless models with an unprecedent precision as well as to probe the higgs boson by allowing its mass and spin measurements  @xcite using the forward detectors proposed for installation at 220 and 420 m in atlas and cms .",
