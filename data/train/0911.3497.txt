    "the analysis of defects in liquid crystals is very important from many points of view . in liquid ",
    "crystal applications , defects play a crucial role in governing display  cell operation .",
    "also , there are interesting theoretical issues in different areas of physics concerning defects @xcite , and the stabilisation of defects has been observed and analysed in computer simulations @xcite .",
    "a defect is a singularity in the director field of the liquid crystal @xcite .",
    "local properties of the liquid crystal , e.g. the nematic order parameter , asymptotically relax to values of the bulk material far from the singularity but , in its immediate neighbourhood , properties undergo abrupt ( i.e. within molecular lengths ) changes ; this region somehow defines microscopically a boundary for the so  called defect core .    beyond the defect core ,",
    "variations are smooth , so that the macroscopic elastic theory of frank @xcite can be used , together with some assumptions about defect core energies and radii . very often core energies are simply ignored",
    ". it would be desirable to have estimations of these properties based on more microscopic approaches . in this context , the landau - de gennes @xcite theory has been extensively used to predict properties of defects , but this theory is still mesoscopic in nature and makes no contact with particle interactions . an alternative is to use computer simulations , but these are generally time consuming for the study of defects .",
    "therefore , the formulation of theories based on molecular approaches are needed .",
    "a microscopic theory , of the maier  saupe type , has been advanced @xcite , but it has some shortcomings ; for example , it predicts all elastic constants to be equal , which causes different types of defects to have identical properties .",
    "this paper is devoted to exploring the consequences of another such theories , namely a simple version of density  functional theory ( dft ) for hard anisotropic particles in two dimensions , which should give more realistic values for the size and energies of defect cores since the theory predicts different values for the elastic constants .",
    "dft is ideal to study liquid ",
    "crystal defects , since it self  consistently gives the thermodynamic and microscopic structural properties of the inhomogeneous nematic fluid .",
    "one advantage of dft over traditional approaches is that elastic constants , in particular the problematic surface elastic constants , and other phenomenological parameters , do not appear explicitely in the theory , but only implicitely through interactions and distribution functions in a free  energy functional which is minimised ( to all orders in the director spatial derivatives ) .",
    "the defect ",
    "core structure appears naturally , and this is ideal since , contrary to the usual approximation within elastic theories of ignoring the defect cores in larger ",
    "sized nematic droplets , the contribution of defects can not be ignored in nanocavities .",
    "one question is why details of defects should be important to understand large - scale configurations of the director field and defect motion .",
    "the microscopic approach enjoys some advantages whenever the relationship between bulk properties ( such as elastic constants ) and molecular structure and interaction parameters is required .",
    "knowledge of the detailed structure of defects will not be crucial to understand large - scale configurations and defect motion in stable nematics subject to boundaries or in nematic matrices where colloidal particles are embedded , but there are circumstances where this may not be so .",
    "for example , in the kinetics of defect formation , re - organisation and anihilation , it may be important to know the core structure at short length scales",
    ". the microscopic approach can give useful estimates of free - energy changes , which are necessary to study the coarsening dynamics at a more microscopic level using , for example , a relaxational dynamical equation . also , the microscopic approach is essential at temperatures close to the clearing temperature , where defects act as nucleation seeds for the isotropic phase , and the structure and dynamics of the defects may be changing dramatically .    in dft",
    "the structure of the fluid is summarised by the local density and orientational distribution functions , which in turn may be used to obtain the more familiar nematic order parameter and local director field ; these two are basic to describe nematic fluids containing defects in the director field .",
    "the connection between the two descriptions is done via the local one  particle distribution function , @xmath2 , which gives the average number of particles at some position @xmath3 with some orientation @xmath4 ( on the two  dimensional plane ) .",
    "this quantity is obtained directly from dft , and from it all interesting fields can be extracted , for example , the microscopic director field @xmath5 , which is obtained locally as the direction where the orientational part of the one  particle distribution function presents a maximum ( the macroscopic nematic director could be obtained by some coarse  grained average of the latter over some appropriate volume ) . therefore the defect core region , along with the far neighbourhood of the singularity , can be analysed within a single framework based on particle interactions .",
    "the computational demands of the method are high , however , and in the present paper we restrict ourselves to the case of two  dimensional cavities of small radii ( in the nm scale ) .",
    "schematic of the two types of defects of topological charge @xmath0 studied in this work .",
    "( a ) radial defect , with particles pointing on average along the radial direction , which excites splay distortion mode .",
    "( b ) tangential defect , with particles pointing on average along the tangential direction , which excites the bend distortion mode .",
    "dark circular regions represent the defect cores .",
    "lines are tangent to the director field.,width=326 ]    a defect is a singularity of the nematic director field @xmath6 , characterised by a topological charge @xmath7 , i.e. the number of turns of the director when the singularity is completely encircled @xcite .",
    "elastic theory assumes smooth spatial variations of the director and therefore is not able to account for the structure of the singularity . in two dimensions",
    "the local elastic free  energy density can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are elastic constants for splay and bend deformations ( twist deformations are not possible in 2d ) .",
    "let us consider the two defects with topological charge @xmath0 depicted in fig .",
    "[ cores ] , which are called ` radial ' ( r ) and ` tangential ' ( t ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is the polar angle of the position vector @xmath3 , then the director field for the r defect is @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , so that only splay deformations are involved . in the t defect",
    "we have @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the only deformations involved are of bend type .",
    "a general deformation will involve both modes .",
    "now , due to the singularity at the origin ( location of defect ) , the elastic free energy within an arbitrary area containing the origin will diverge logarithmically : elastic theory fails here , and it is necessary to subtract this region by arbitrarily defining a core region , with free energy @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 .",
    "the free energy within a circle or radius @xmath18 will be : @xmath19 for @xmath20 these energies diverge logarithmically , a situation that can not arise in practice due to the presence of defects with opposite charge in the material .",
    "little is known about the structure and properties of defect cores @xcite .",
    "they are generally treated at a qualitative level , estimating the radius and defect  core energy in an approximate way @xcite .",
    "sometimes it is assumed these energies to be negligible compared with the elastic energy , and therefore defect cores are neglected altogether , a drastic simplification which can be severe if the system size is small .",
    "one of the first attempts to describe the defect core is due to schopohl and sluckin @xcite , who analysed a @xmath21disclination using landau  de gennes theory with the complete ordering tensor @xmath22 .",
    "this study demonstrated that the core of these defects does not consist of a region of isotropic material , but rather it is ordered along the disclination line ( a possibility that does not exist in 2d ) .",
    "later monte carlo simulations on a hard spherocylinder model by hudson y larson @xcite corroborated this prediction , and also found a new structure with a stable triangular nucleus for very elongated molecules .",
    "in the only truly microscopic theory presented so far , sigillo et al .",
    "@xcite used an approach based on a maier  saupe theory with an orientational distribution function , analysing disclination lines of charge @xmath0 within a cylinder .",
    "this is a three  dimensional setup , while ours is a two  dimensional one .",
    "however , if one forgets about escape configurations , the director field should in this case exhibit the same kind of configurations as in our problem .",
    "the authors observed that the radius of the core decreases as the orientational order parameter increases . also , they examined radial and tangential defects and analysed their cores and their energies , obtaining that the two have the same size and energy .",
    "as the authors recognise this conclusion , which is certainly wrong , is due to the simplified interaction potential used , inherent in the maier ",
    "saupe theory , which predicts identical values for all the fluid elastic constants .",
    "despite the reduced theoretical attention received , defect cores may play a very important role in many aspects of liquid  crystal science .",
    "@xcite studied disclination lines of charge @xmath0 and @xmath1 near the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition in 3d , and explained the impossibility of heating a nematic material above a critical temperature @xmath23 ( clearing point ) which is below the limit of metastability of the nematic phase , due to the growth of the isotropic core .",
    "defect cores properties may also be relevant in dynamical aspects such as defect motion @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make a first attempt at calculating the properties of a defect core using a microscopic approach based on density  functional theory , using hard  particle interactions .",

    "[ elas ] is devoted to the calculation of the elastic constants of the model .",
    "in contrast with elastic or landau approaches , the dft formalism does not require to specify which region is the core and which region is not the core , so that some criterion , similar to the gibbs dividing surface in the statistical mechanics of interfaces , is needed to define the core . in order to analyse this problem",
    "it is necessary to compare the results from dft with elastic theory , and this demands knowledge of the splay and bend elastic constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the values of these constants can be obtained within the same dft framework . in sec . [ results ] we present results for two types of point defects of charge @xmath0 inside a circular cavity , placing emphasis on the size and energy of the defect core .",

    "both these effects play against the possibility of reaching the elastic rgime in the region between the defect and the surface .",

    "the minimum  energy state contains two defects of charge @xmath1 , separated by a distance @xmath151 , when the cavity radius is sufficiently large , but the analysis is more complicated here , as two additional minimisations are required : a partial one with respect to the ` fast ' variables at fixed defect separation , and a minimisation with respect to the defect separation @xmath151 , which is a slow variable . as a result , the computation time increases by an order of magnitude .",
    "the practical consequence is that the maximum radius of the cavity that can be analysed is reduced , and the task of splitting contributions of defect cores from the rest becomes harder .    in fig .",

    "the right column shows the same profiles when the chemical potential is increased to @xmath154 . in the corners of the density plots the structure has radial symmetry : this is a surface effect .",

    ", we have not been able yet to study cavities large enough for the core structure and the surface structure to relax completely to the elastic limit , but qualitative estimates can be obtained for the relevant properties of the core .",

    "[ defectos12 ] . in panel",
    "( a ) we plot the average radius of a defect core as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "similar to the radial defect , the average radius @xmath17 has been defined as the inflection point of the density profile , averaged over all directions ( since here there is no angular symmetry ) .",
    "we can see that there is a rapid decay as @xmath69 increases , and @xmath17 levels off at a value approximately equal to half the value for the radial defect [ see fig . [",
    "nucleo](c ) ] .",
    "therefore , the core area , which is proportional to @xmath155 , is about four times less in the case @xmath1 than in the case @xmath156 . in panel ( b ) of the same figure , we plot the defect core energy as a function of the elastic constant @xmath24 .",
    "the straight line is a linear regression with slope @xmath157 , approximately a factor @xmath158 smaller than in the @xmath0 defect .",
    "we could expect a factor 2 beforehand , since we know in advance that , even in very small cavities , the structure with two @xmath1 defects is more stable than that with a single , radial defect . in this case",
    "the largest contribution to the free energy comes from the defect cores , and therefore the energy of both cores plus their repulsive energy must be at most equal to the energy of the radial defect .",
    "we mentioned before that the defect energy is generally taken to be @xmath137 and we would expect a factor @xmath159 in the case @xmath1 with respect to the radial defect ( the size is approximately four times smaller ) .",
    "the behaviour of the director field in the core region exhibits bend  like distortions ( @xmath160 ) for @xmath1 , which do not appear in the radial defect and can be the origin of such a difference .",
    "in summary , we have studied the core properties of a defect in 2d , using a dft ( microscopic ) model , free from fitting parameters , that includes consistently variations in density and nematic order parameter .",
    "all cases studied predict the formation of an isotropic region in the defect , something to be expected in 2d .",
    "the core free energy is proportional to the elastic constant , with a varying proportionality constant that depends on the type of defect studied ; this is due to the different energetic cost associated with deformations of splay and bend type .",
    "the size of the defect cores is on the order of a few particle lengths , and decreases as the nematic ordering of the surrounding fluid increases .",
    "the core size saturates for strong nematic ordering .",
    "the study of a 2d defected nematic fluid , used here mainly for computational reasons , may be useful to understand 3d phenomena in the physics of defects .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , knowledge on the structure and energetics of defects may be important in dynamical problems , such as defect formation or nucleation and coarsing of the nematic and isotropic phases .",
    "this structure may be changing in time and a microscopic approach may be helpful to follow the dynamics via relaxation equations that involve the gradient of a free energy . a natural extension of our work therefore involves the study of 3d nematic fluids and their defects .",
    "schemes where the microscopic and mesoscopic approaches are combined would also be useful in the above - mentioned problems , and work along this avenue is under way in our group .",
