    "the agreement of the miniboone and lsnd signals in favor of neutrino oscillations is remarkable , because the two experiments observed the signal of @xmath0 transitions at different source - detector distances and different neutrino energy ranges .",
    "since only the ratio of distance and energy is similar in the two experiments and neutrino oscillations depend just on this ratio ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the neutrino oscillation explanation of the two signals is strongly favored . on the other hand",
    ", the miniboone collaboration did not observe any signal of short - baseline @xmath4 transitions @xcite compatible with the miniboone and lsnd signals of @xmath0 transitions .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the effective parameters which govern neutrino and antineutrino oscillations are different , maybe because of a violation of the cpt symmetry @xcite . from a phenomenological point of view , it is interesting to consider the neutrino and antineutrino sectors independently , especially in view of possible experimental checks of the short - baseline @xmath0 signal @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt this point of view and we present the results of a combined fit of the miniboone and lsnd antineutrino data in favor of short - baseline @xmath0 transitions , together with the constraints imposed by the data of the karmen experiment @xcite in which the transitions have not been observed .",
    "we also take into account the model - independent constraints imposed by the data of reactor @xmath1 disappearance experiments .    in the analysis of the data of @xmath0 oscillation experiments we consider the simplest case of an effective two - neutrino - like short - baseline oscillation probability , similar to that obtained in the case of four - neutrino mixing ( see refs .",
