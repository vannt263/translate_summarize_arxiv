    "lamno@xmath0 is a layer antiferromagnetic perovskite which displays weak ferromagnetism ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 behaviour indicates that the ordered moments acquire a tiny ferromagnetic component by a tiny tilt out of the layer plane .",
    "lamno@xmath0 is also the parent of a family of magnetic materials , the manganites , which are of current wide interest because of the interconnection between their structural , transport and magnetic properties .",
    "the features of this family , including colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) and a very large spin polarization of the conduction band around 1/3 doping , make them promising for future applications .",
    "moreover they are of prominent interest for the understanding of correlated electron systems .",
    "manganites are characterized by the coexistence of several interactions on comparable energy scales , which produce a complex interplay of magnetism , electron - lattice coupling , orbital and charge ordering .",
    "this shows up as soon as the system starts to be doped , typically by heterovalent cation substitution , giving rise to phase separation , magnetic polarons and eventually to the cmr phenomenon .",
    "however many of the basic ingredients , such as for instance orbital ordering and a large jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion , are already present in pure lamno@xmath0 .",
    "some authors actually question its description as a simple insulating antiferromagnet , and suggest that the unusual layered magnetic structure is an effect of the static cooperative jt deformations on the magnetic interactions , as a sort of precursor to the double - exchange ferromagnetism of the doped compound@xcite .",
    "these features underlines the relevance of an accurate determination of the properties of the end member .",
    "our single crystal investigation by muon spin rotation ( @xmath4 ) attains two main results : we obtain a direct microscopic determination of a few magnetic properties of this important material and we identify with a high confidence level the interstitial sites occupied by the muons .",
    "the first aspect covers static and dynamic critical exponents of the antiferromagnetic transition , as well as the initial process of weak ferromagnetic saturation .",
    "critical phenomena have been addressed also in the substituted compounds , both by neutron scattering @xcite and by macroscopic magnetization @xcite , hence it is of primary interest to obtain accurate measurements of the same quantities and behaviors with a microscopic probe in the end member , much less prone to stoichiometry problem .",
    "furthermore non trivial consequences of the weak ferromagnetism are also revealed .",
    "the second aspect is also of general relevance , since it contributes to the understanding of muon localization in crystals , with something more than a new single case .",
    "the insight by @xmath4 is often greatly enhanced by the knowledge of the muon site and the systematics in this field is far from complete .",
    "we believe that after our contribution the situation in lamno@xmath0 is better understood than , for instance , in all the cuprates . hopefully our results can be extended in part to other oxide and fluorite perovskites , including kcuf@xmath0 and the high @xmath5 materials .",

    "this is indeed experimentally determined by magnetization @xcite and antiferromagnetic resonance @xcite , with a canting angle of 2 degrees , while neutron diffraction data@xcite set an upper limit of 1 degree to its value .",
    "this second determination is insensitive to any accidental small fraction of the ferromagnetic compositions , hence it should reflect the intrinsic local value .",
    "our sample is a microtwinned single crystal grown by the float zone method @xcite at the laboratoire de chimie physique , universit paris - sud , cut into a slice of roughly 24x7x2 mm@xmath13 .",
    "six families of cubic microtwins are present @xcite , obtained one from another by interchange of @xmath14[100]@xmath15,@xmath14[010]@xmath15 and @xmath14[001]@xmath15 .",

    "in gps the positron detectors lie in the @xmath49 plane ( with @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) and the cryostat lies along the @xmath49 direction . a small magnetic field ( 5 mt ) can be applied along @xmath52 for calibration ; larger fields may be applied along @xmath53 .",
    "the initial muon spin direction lies in the @xmath49 plane at a chosen angle @xmath54 deg , depending on the settings of a cross - field device ( spin rotator ) in the beamline .",

    "the inset shows a geometry which justifies this behaviour : the lower frequency corresponds to an internal field @xmath64 along [ 001 ] ( the @xmath3 axis ) while the higher frequencies correspond to an internal field perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the external field saturates the sample and adds vectorially as shown , giving rise to one lower and two higher precession frequencies . the geometry and magnitude of the internal fields is discussed below .",
    "we start by noting that an identical behavior is detected in several @xmath4 experiments performed on orthoferrite single crystals @xcite . there",
    "the upward shift of the low frequency precession is justified on the basis of the following two assumptions : _ a ) _ a local field entirely of dipolar nature , and _",

    "these assumptions turn out to be very reasonable for the orthoferrites , which are isostructural to lamno@xmath0 , therefore we start from the same conjecture .",

    "appendix [ sec : dipsum ] discusses briefly the assignment : it shows that the non - vanishing dipolar field @xmath32 is along [ 001]@xmath15 and it explains why a sufficiently large external field produces only the upward frequency shift for such a site , which is a consequence of the weak ferromagnetism of lamno@xmath0 .",

    "we have clarified the identification of the two muon sites in lamno@xmath0 , the @xmath71 and @xmath81 sites .",
    "our single crystal data provide a definitive assessment of the former , while the latter is proposed here for the first time",

    "only the components of the mn magnetic moments in the plane of the drawing are considered , since the perpendicular components give opposite dipolar field contributions which cancel .",
    "the thinner arrows in the figure indicate the dipolar term from each mn ion at a generic site in the mirror plane : it is graphically evident that their sum lies along [ 001 ] , as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : tensor ] .",
    "similar arguments hold for the other components of the tensor .",
    "notice that the figure shows just one af domain ( the bottom mn moment belongs , say , to the @xmath57 sublattice ) ; the opposite direction of @xmath138 is obtained in the other af domain ( where the bottom mn moment belongs to the @xmath84 sublattice ; imagine the figure with all arrows reversed ) . however according to the pnmb symmetry",
    "the @xmath84 domain must also have its @xmath3 component in the opposite direction along @xmath137_p$ ] .",
    "based upon these consideration we may understand the field behavior of the @xmath4 precessions .",
    "the @xmath3 spin component is totally negligible in our dipolar sums , but it gives a net @xmath3 moment @xmath139 to each domain , which couples to an external field @xmath118 .",
    "when @xmath118 saturates the macroscopic @xmath3 moment only one of the two domains survives  specifically that with @xmath140 .",
    "it appears that @xmath141 and @xmath138 at the @xmath71 muon site are pointing in the same direction , so that when the component of @xmath118 along [ 001 ] is larger than the saturation value one has @xmath142 , hence the precession frequency shifts upwards , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1koe ] .",
    "by contrast at the @xmath81 site the internal field is in the direction of the spin and its the vector composition with @xmath77 is not influenced by the af domain structure ( all possible geometries are obtained within each domain ) .",
    "we have employed a procedure to fit the whole set of data recorded at each temperature and field .",
    "the global chi square , @xmath143 , is obtained from the count rates @xmath144 of the four detectors directed along @xmath145 , at each recorded time @xmath146 . the model function @xmath147 , briefly described in sec .",
    "[ sec : musr ] , depends on several parameters , of which only few  field intensities , their orientations and the relaxation rates  are informative of the magnetic properties of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the rest are of lesser interest in this respect , such as the angle @xmath148 defining the initial muon spin direction , the experimental asymmetry @xmath149 of the reference @xmath17 detector , the muon fractions , @xmath44 and the individual initial count rates , @xmath150 , instrumental delay times , @xmath151 and relative efficiencies @xmath152 for all the @xmath57 detectors .",
    "the asymmetry parameter of each detector is @xmath153 , and the efficiency of the reference detector is fixed , @xmath154 .",
    "all these are a byproduct of the fit procedure , and a number of them may be accurately determined in separate high statistics calibration experiments .",
    "all models generally include one or more contribution to the polarization functions , as in the case described by eq .",
    "[ eq : polarization ] , which points out that quite generally each local field @xmath45 identifies a muon fraction @xmath44 characterized by its transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates , @xmath155 and @xmath156 . when fitting more than one fraction , however , it is often impossible to distinguish individual _ longitudinal _ rates and a single @xmath157 value is employed .",
    "the advantage of the global approach is that the direction of the local field @xmath45 may be extracted from the data , since it determines the aperture of the muon spin precession cone .",
    "this is incidentally not true for the zero - field sum over our cubic twins , discussed in eq .",
    "[ eq : polarization ] , since the information on the local field direction is lost by symmetry .",
    "nonetheless this zero field model is very easy to implement in the global fit scheme and the field values of section [ sec : magne - relax ] are indeed obtained from such a fit .",
    "the global approach becomes more valuable in an applied external field @xmath118 , were the direction of the internal field @xmath33 may be determined . in this case",
    "the direction of the local field @xmath158 in each twin may be expressed in terms of the three euler angles @xmath159 which define the crystal orientation in the laboratory @xmath160 frame .",
    "therefore , following the discussion of appendix [ sec : dipsum ] , we have implemented two further models : one to account for the @xmath71 site in the saturated @xmath3 state ( spontaneous field @xmath32 along the local @xmath68 direction , in three twin replicae , chosen with the condition that @xmath161 ) ; another one to account for the @xmath81 site ( spontaneous field @xmath33 along the local electron moment direction  @xmath162_o$ ]  in six distinguishable replicae ) .",
    "the analytic expression of the corresponding functions @xmath163 , involving their dependence on @xmath159 and the vector composition of the internal and external fields , was generated and checked by means of a simple maple v program .",
    "the best - global - fit values discussed in section [ sec : sites ] refer to a model function including both sites .",
    "because of the relatively large number of parameters the convergence of the global fit requires some practice , but reliable fits were always obtained with @xmath164 values better than 1.1 per degree of freedom .",
    "the fit quality is good but not perfect , as it may be judged from the comparison between the ft of the data and of the fitting function in fig .",
    "[ fig:1koe]b , c .",
    "the small disagreement may be imputed to simplifying assumptions in the fit function , in which the crystal twins are weighted equally , while x - ray diffraction in similar samples showed slight preponderance of one twin @xcite , and relaxations are all assumed lorentzian , while probably a gaussian @xmath165 rate is more appropriate .",
    "figure [ fig : angles ] shows the temperature dependence of the muon fractions and of the initial muon spin phase @xmath166 , obtained from the zero field data .",
    "the phase @xmath166 is perfectly stable , while the two fractions do show some small spurious correlation effects close to the transition , where the relaxation rates diverge .",
    "this is acceptable since it has no appreciable influence on the critical analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : magne - relax ] .",
    "the inset shows the scattering of the time delays of the four detectors both in the zero field data ( open symbols ) and in the longitudinal field data , which are fitted with different functions .",
    "these parameters are stable and insensitive to both field and model function employed .",
