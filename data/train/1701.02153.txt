    "<S> the fact that these features can be seen at @xmath58  v , where the six - fold amr is absent [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) ] , implies that they have a different origin . </S>",
    "<S> one expects that the strong magnetic field of 13.5  t , at which our amr measurements were carried out , will be able to align all magnetic domains ( if these exist ) along the magnetic field direction , thus ruling out magnetic domain structure as an explanation . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is the presence of substrate terrace in ti - terminated sto , which defines an anisotropy direction for conduction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the direction of the uniaxial component is not the same for our three devices , which were grown on the same substrate , thus eliminating this scenario as well . </S>",
    "<S> all this implies that the observed uniaxial amr anisotropy should be related to structural domains in sto . </S>",
    "<S> recently , anisotropic conductance has been observed in ( 001 ) lao / sto  @xcite , which arises due to the formation of tetragonal domains in sto below 105  k. sto can have three different types of domains x , y , and z ( distorted along the corresponding three principal directions of the original cubic lattice ) . </S>",
    "<S> these may form six boundary planes : ( 110 ) and ( 1@xmath80 ) for x - y , ( 011 ) and ( 0@xmath81 ) for y - z , and ( 101 ) and ( 10@xmath8 ) for z - x @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these boundaries provide a low - resistance path , leading to anisotropy between the resistance in the parallel and perpendicular directions . in case of the ( 111 ) interface </S>",
    "<S> , these boundaries lie along [ 10@xmath8 ] and [ @xmath82@xmath8 ] for x - y , [ 01@xmath8 ] and [ 2@xmath8@xmath8 ] for y - z , and [ 1@xmath80 ] and [ 11@xmath65 for z - x . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can have six possible anisotropy directions depending upon the type of domain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that our devices situated at different regions of sto will have different domain boundaries , and hence different anisotropy directions . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these structural domain boundaries manifest in the current response to a magnetic field .    based on the above , one may then argue that by assuming that all six types of boundaries exist in equal proportions within the device , one could account for observed six - fold effect as well . </S>",
    "<S> however , as noted above , the six - fold effect and the uniaxial anisotropy appear in different gate voltage ranges . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp temperature dependence of the six - fold effect and its presence below 20 k [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(f ) ] also disfavor structural domains as its origin . finally , we have measured smaller ( 10  @xmath6 m @xmath7 28  @xmath6 m ) hall bar devices , and observed similar six - fold amr ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s4 in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> since existence of an approximately `` equal mixture '' of the six boundaries between two voltage terminals in such a small device is highly unlikely , we conclude that the six - fold amr is a manifestation of the six - fold anisotropy of the ( 111 ) plane of the undistorted cubic crystal .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussion. _ what could then be the origin of the six - fold crystalline amr ? </S>",
    "<S> amr necessitates spin - orbit interaction , and usually only appears in conjunction with magnetic order , typically ferromagnetic  @xcite ( see however @xcite ) . in ( 100 ) </S>",
    "<S> lao / sto , strong and tunable spin - orbit interaction has been reported @xcite and related to amr effects @xcite . however , the evidence for magnetic order at the temperature range of our experiment ( @xmath67 2  k ) is elusive even for the better - studied ( 100 ) interface @xcite : magnetic hysteresis has been observed only below 1  k in a quasi-1d ( 100 ) system @xcite . and our current measurements on ( 111 ) </S>",
    "<S> lao / sto have shown no indication of magnetic order ( e.g. , no anomalous hall effect or hysteresis ) in the temperature range studied . </S>",
    "<S> randomly - positioned magnetic dipoles have been observed in ( 100 ) lao / sto @xcite , which can account for the observations in the quasi-1d ( 100 ) case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but it is unlikely that such scattered magnetic structure can account for the robust features we observe here with various device size and orientation .    </S>",
    "<S> the amr coefficients @xmath51 ( standard amr ) and @xmath53 ( crystalline amr ) have strikingly different temperature and gate voltage dependences as well as opposite signs [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(e , f ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that they arise from different mechanisms . in a ( 111 ) </S>",
    "<S> heterostructure the titanium t@xmath68 bands , which are believed to give rise to the 2d conduction , are split into two spin-3/2 bands and a spin-1/2 one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a natural possibility is therefore that @xmath53 appears ( as function of @xmath22 ) upon the entrance of a higher band with stronger spin - orbit effects . </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate that such band is responsible for the change of slope in the gate dependence of the resistivity and hall coefficient in the same @xmath22 range [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d , e ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that joshua _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> have reported that crystalline and non - crystalline amr have different gate voltage dependence , and suggested that crystalline amr is related to a lifshitz transition in ( 100 ) lao / sto @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , by studying devices patterned along different crystal directions , flekser _ et al . _ have found that all the amr features depend only on @xmath69 ( the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath24 ) , indicating that amr in the ( 100 ) system is non - crystalline @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is very different from our current results for ( 111 ) lao / sto , which have different dependence on @xmath43 and @xmath54 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 ] .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion. _ to summarize , we utilize the unique hexagonal crystal symmetry of the ( 111 ) lao / sto interface to provide a conclusive evidence for the crystalline nature of amr in such oxide interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that the magnetic effects in this interface are firmly related to underlying crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dependence of amr on carrier concentration suggests that the itinerant electrons from higher energy bands couple strongly to the lattice and contribute to the magnetic effects .    _ </S>",
