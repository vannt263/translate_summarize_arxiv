    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the gauge theory of strong interaction .",
    "recently , the qcd phase diagram including chiral symmetry breaking ( restoration )  @xcite , quark confinement ( deconfinement )  @xcite , color superconductivity  @xcite were investigated with finite temperature and finite chemical potential .",
    "furthermore , the studies are extended to finite isospin chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "it is found that at a critical isospin chemical potential , which is about the pion mass in vacuum , the phase transition from normal phase to pion superfluidity phase will happen .",
    "the understanding of the properties of pion superfluidity and phase structure under the extreme conditions are important in conducting research of the physics of the compact objects and relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is reported that very strong magnetic field may be generated in the heavy - ion collision  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field magnitudes were estimated to be 5.3@xmath0 at the relativistic heavy - ion collision(rhic ) and 6@xmath0 at the large hadron collision(lhc ) , and even higher  @xcite .",
    "such magnetic field can also exist in magnetars  @xcite and in the early universe  @xcite despite the origin of such strong field is not clear yet .",
    "above phenomena lead us to think deeply about the influence of the magnetic field on the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "recently , much work has been done about the influence of the magnetic field on the properties of quark matter  @xcite , chiral transition  @xcite and color superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "normally , qcd is widely accepted as the correct theory describing strongly interacting matter at high temperature and high density .",
    "the low energy qcd vacuum is hard to be fully understood by using of perturbative methods , because the characteristics of chiral symmetry breaking and color confinement have a non - perturbative origin . to solve the problem , two approaches are introduced ,",
    "one is lattice qcd simulations  @xcite and the other is the effective model method .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite is used as a simple and practical chiral model , which satisfies the basic mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and key features of qcd at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "one of the basic properties of this model is that it includes a gap equation which connect the chiral condensate to the dynamical quark mass .",
    "it is well known that the hadronic mass spectra and the static properties of meson , especially the chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking , can be obtained through the mean field approximation ( rpa ) of meson in the njl model .",
    "this model and its extended version ( pnjl , epnjl , etc . ) are also widely used to study the properties of deconfinement phase , the color superconductivity phase , and the pion superfluidity phase and the related phase transitions under extreme conditions .",
    "recently , the strong magnetic field effect on the properties of quark matter  @xcite , and the phase transitions , including chiral restoration transition , deconfinement transition  @xcite and color superconductivity transition  @xcite , has been investigated in the njl - type models by many groups .    in this paper , we will mainly focus on the effect of external magnetic fields on the pion condensate and the pion superfluidity phase structure at finite temperature and finite isospin chemical potential .",
