    "effective models are at the very center of theoretical physics since they allow to focus on the essential physics of a problem without being distracted by unnecessary complexity .",
    "hence it is very important to dispose of _ systematic _ means to derive effective models . here we will present the mathematical structure of a certain kind of effective models , namely effective models where the elementary excitations above the ground state can be viewed as particles above a complex vacuum .",
    "this type of view is very common in low - temperature physics .",
    "many experiments can be understood on the basis of this picture .    in this paper",
    ", we will elucidate the global structure of the hamiltonian and of the observables if the model is transformed to a model which _ conserves _ the number of particles .",
    "such a mapping is often possible and renders the subsequent calculation of physical quantities much easier .",
    "the determination of the effective hamiltonian is facilitated by the decomposition into @xmath0-particle irreducible parts .",
    "we set up such a classification at zero temperature for _ strong - coupling _ situations , i.e.no weak - coupling limit is needed and no non - interacting fermions or bosons are required .",
    "generically , we deal with hard - core bosons .",
    "the necessity for the decomposition into @xmath0-particle irreducible parts has arisen in perturbative calculations of the effective hamiltonians because only the @xmath0-particle irreducible interactions are independent of the system size .",
    "the second main point of this article is the perturbative computation of effective hamiltonians and observables .",
    "such computations are a standard technique for ground state energies ( 0-particle terms ) and dispersion relations ( 1-particle terms ) , see ref .   and references therein .",
    "but the possibility to compute multi - particle contributions has only recently been realized @xcite and continues to be exploited intensively .",
    "the key ingredient is to define a similarity transformation on the operator level ( see below ) .    a promising alternative route , which we can only sketch in this article , consists in the non - perturbative , renormalizing realization of the transformation of the initial model to the effective model which conserved the number of particles . examples of this approach are realized in fermionic models @xcite .",
    "we consider models which are defined on a lattice @xmath1 . at each site of the lattice",
    "the system can be in a number @xmath2 of states spanning the local hilbert space .",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 is finite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath3 acting in the tensor - product space of the local hilbert spaces . for simplicity",
    "we do not consider antisymmetric , fermionic situations although this is also possible .",
    "so we are focusing on physical systems which can be described in terms of hard - core bosons .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 is assumed to be of finite range .",
    "this means that it is composed of _ local _ operators @xmath4 acting on a _ finite _ number of sites in the vicinity of the site @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 we further assume , that @xmath3 can be split as @xmath7 so that the spectrum of @xmath8 is simple ( see below ) and that the system does not undergo a phase transition from @xmath9 to the range of values we are finally interested in . these requirements do not necessarily imply that @xmath10 has to be small .",
    "but it is helpful if this is the case .",
    "the ground state of @xmath8 and its lowest lying eigen - states shall be known .",
    "the latter will be viewed as elementary excitations from which the whole spectrum can be built .",
    "we assume that we can view the elementary excitations above the ground state as ( quasi-)particles above the vacuum . for simplicity , we will drop the prefix ` quasi- ' ; it is understood that ` particle ' is a synonym for elementary excitation .",
    "we assume that the physical picture sketched for @xmath11 is linked _",
    "continuously _ to the range @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the critical value at which a phase transition occurs .",
    "at the critical value @xmath13 the picture breaks down and can not be used beyond @xmath14 .",
    "generically , a mode of @xmath15 will become soft at @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the particles for @xmath9 shall be local in the sense that we can assign a site to each of them .",
    "let @xmath16 be the operator that counts the number of particles .",
    "as a concrete example , the reader may think of an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model made up from strongly coupled ( coupling @xmath17 ) pairs of spins ( ` dimers ' ) which are weakly coupled ( coupling @xmath18 ) among themselves , e.g.  . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the ground state is the product state with singlets on all dimers ; the elementary excitations are local triplets",
    ". the number of these local triplets , i.e.the number of dimers which are not in the singlet state , shall be given by the operator @xmath16 .",
    "a considerable simplification of the problem can be achieved by mapping the initial problem @xmath15 to an effective hamiltonian @xmath19 in which the number of elementary excitations does not change .",
    "that is the number of particles should be a conserved quantity .",
    "then the computation of many physical quantities is significantly simplified .    in this article",
    ", we advocate to use a continuous unitary transformation ( cut )  @xcite in order to achieve a systematically controlled mapping of the kind described above which leads to @xmath20=0\\ , \\ ] ] i.e.  @xmath21 conserves the number of particles .",
    "such an approach has three major advantages :    1 .",
    "conceptual clarity + using a unitary transformation guarantees that no information of the orginial model is lost . in particular , it is clear that the _ same _ transformation @xcite can be applied to obtain the effective observables @xmath22 from the original observables @xmath23 .",
    "technical simplicity + to implement the unitary transformation in a continuous fashion only the computation of commutators is required since the mapping is split into infinitesimal steps leading to a differential equation @xcite @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 $ ] is an auxiliary parameter parametrizing the continuous transformation with starting point @xmath26 and end point @xmath27 .",
    "good controllability + by an appropriate choice of the infinitesimal generator @xmath28 of the transformation it can be designed such that is preserves block - band diagonality @xcite . moreover , it is renormalizing in the sense that matrix elements between energetically very different states are transformed more rapidly than those between energetically adjacent states @xcite .",
    "we like to point out , however , that the general structure of operators does not depend on the details of the method by which the effective particle - conserving model is obtained . also other methods than cuts are conceivable .    in the present paper",
    "we will focus on perturbative realizations of the cuts .",
    "this approach @xcite was the first which realized the computation of bound states in higher orders @xcite .",
    "the concept of a similarity transformation is indispensible for a conceptually clear computation of multi - particle effects @xcite .      in sect .",
    "[ lct ] we analyse global structural aspects of effective operators . the basic prerequisite will be eq .",
    "( [ h_q_com ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that the linked cluster property holds .",
    "therefore the effective operators which hold in the thermodynamic limit can be computed in finite systems .",
    "[ h_trafo ] is a preparatory section in which the perturbative cut for hamilton operators of certain kind is constructed .",
    "low - dimensional spin models on lattices are among the models which can be treated in this way .",
    "[ o_trafo ] contains a detailed description of how the perturbative cut can be extended to transform general observables .",
    "series expansions in @xmath10 for the effective observables are obtained which allow to compute the experimentally relevant spectral functions .",
    "so the extension from hamiltonians to observables is an important one .",
    "the article is concluded in sect .  v.",
    "in this section , we _ assume _ that we are able to construct a mapping such that @xmath21 fulfills eq .",
    "( [ h_q_com ] ) .",
    "the eigen - states of the particle number operator @xmath16 serve as a basis for the hilbert space of the system .",
    "if the mapping is realized perturbatively , the matrix elements of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are polynomials in @xmath10 .",
    "we will show that @xmath21 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an @xmath0-particle irreducible operator , i.e. @xmath30 measures @xmath0-particle energies .",
    "moreover , each thermodynamic matrix element of any of the components @xmath30 can be obtained on finite clusters for a given order in @xmath10 if the original hamiltonian is of finite range .",
    "the components @xmath30 can be defined recursively in ascending order in @xmath0 .",
    "( [ h_hauptzerl ] ) comprises already a route to determine the properties of @xmath21 in a sequence of approximate treatments .",
    "the very first step is to know the ground state energy which defines @xmath31 .",
    "the second level is to describe the dynamics of a single particle ( elementary excitations ) correctly which is possible by knowing @xmath32 .",
    "the third level is reached if @xmath33 is included which contains the information on the interaction of two particles .",
    "true three - particle interactions are contained in @xmath34 and so on . from the generic experience in condensed matter theory ,",
    "the three- and more particle terms can very often be neglected .",
    "so the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ h_hauptzerl ] ) provide the systematically controlled starting point of a broad class of problems .",
    "let us clarify some notation .",
    "we define the following eigen - states of the particle number operator @xmath16 @xmath35 i.e.  @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and so on .",
    "these states span the global hilbert space @xmath39 of the physical system under study . dealing with ( hard - core ) bosons @xmath40 and @xmath41 are identical states .",
    "this indistinguishability causes a certain ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity can be remedied for instance by assuming that coefficients depending on several indices @xmath42 are even under permutation of any pair of these indices @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the ground state @xmath43 is assumed to be unique .",
    "let @xmath44 be an arbitrary operator acting on @xmath45 and conserving the number of particles @xmath46=0 $ ] .",
    "by @xmath47 we denote the restricted operator acting on @xmath48 spanned by all states with exactly @xmath0 particles .",
    "now we define the operators @xmath30    [ class ] @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the identity operator .",
    "note that these operators are defined on the full hilbert space @xmath39 .",
    "the operators @xmath51 are _ local _ operators that annihilate ( create ) particles at site @xmath52 .",
    "they are bosonic operators .",
    "their definition can be tailored to include a hard - core repulsion between the particles to account for the common situation that at maximum one of the particles may be present at given site @xmath52 . if the particles have additional internal quantum numbers , i.e.  if there can be different particles at each site , the indices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are substituted by multi - indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    as an example",
    "let us consider that there are three kinds of particles per sites , but that at maximum one of these particles can occupy a given site .",
    "then each site corresponds to a four - level system ; the particles are hard - core bosons .",
    "such a situation arises in antiferromagnetic dimerized spin systems where each dimer represents a four - level system .",
    "the ground state is the unique singlet while the three particles are given by the three - fold degenerate triplet states . in this case",
    "we have the multi - indices @xmath56 , where @xmath52 denotes the site and @xmath57 takes for instance the three values of the @xmath58 component @xmath59 . in the local basis @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the singlet , the local creation operators @xmath62 are the @xmath63-matrices    [ e_def ] @xmath64    it is understood that the action at all other sites but @xmath52 is the identity so that the operators in ( [ e_def ] ) are defined on the whole hilbert space .",
    "the annihilation operators @xmath65 are given by the hermitian conjugate matrices .",
    "all possible commutators can easily be computed within the matrix representation .",
    "finite matrix elements in the lower right @xmath66 block can be viewed as combined annihilation & creation processes : the matrix @xmath67 with all elements zero except the one at @xmath68 corresponds to the process @xmath69 .",
    "a finite matrix element in the upper left @xmath70 block , i.e.  the singlet - singlet channel , can be expressed in normal - ordered fashion as @xmath71 . in this way",
    "the operators ( [ e_def ] ) and their hermitian conjugate define a complete algebra which in turn enables us to classify contributions of the hamiltonian according to the number of particles affected as done in eqs .",
    "( [ h_hauptzerl ] ) and ( [ class ] ) .",
    "the decomposition ( [ h_hauptzerl ] ) is physically very intuitive .",
    "yet the next important question is whether and how the operators @xmath30 are unambiguously defined .",
    "this issue is addressed by noting that @xmath72 vanishes for @xmath73 .",
    "this follows directly from the normal - ordering of the creation and annihilation operators in eq .",
    "( [ class ] )",
    ". then we can proceed iteratively by requiring that @xmath21 applied to @xmath0 particles corresponds to @xmath74 ( @xmath0 arbitrary but fixed ) . solving for @xmath30 yields the recursions    [ rekurs ] @xmath75    assuming that @xmath21 is calculated beforehand one starts by evaluating @xmath76 by means of the first definition .",
    "the result entirely defines @xmath31 .",
    "the restriction @xmath77 is then used in the second equation to extract the @xmath78 of @xmath32 and so on .",
    "generally , @xmath30 is defined on the full many - particle hilbert space , not only for @xmath0 particles .",

    "it is the essential merit of the notation in second quantization ( [ class ] ) that it provides the natural generalization of the action of a part of the hamiltonian on a _ finite _ number of particles to an _ arbitrary _ number of particles . since eq .",

    "( [ h_hauptzerl ] ) , neglecting the precise definition of convergence which is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in conventional many - body language ,",
    "@xmath30 stands for the @xmath0-particle irreducible interaction .",

    "( [ rekurs ] ) ensure that @xmath30 contains no reducible contributions , i.e.  contributions which really act only on a lower number of particles .",

    "it is possible to start from any type of elementary particles counted by some operator @xmath16 .",

    "@xcite and for 1-particle properties @xcite .",
    "the feature that the hamiltonian is of finite range on the lattice is exploited .",
    "then the eqs .",
    "( [ rekurs ] ) can be evaluated on finite subsystems ( clusters , see below ) .",
    "still , the thermodynamically relevant matrix elements of the operators @xmath30 are obtained as we show in the following paragraphs .    to proceed further definitions",
    "are needed .",

    "@xmath79 of the thermodynamic system is a _",

    "we denote an operator which acts only on the hilbert space @xmath81 of @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath82 denotes the sites of the total system which are not included in @xmath79 , the restricted operator @xmath80 is lifted naturally to an operator @xmath44 in the total hilbert space @xmath83 by @xmath84 note that it is not possible to define a restricted operator @xmath80 from an arbitrary operator @xmath44 acting on @xmath39 since @xmath44 will not have the product structure ( [ prodstruc ] ) in general .    two clusters @xmath85 and @xmath86 are said to form a _ disconnected cluster _ @xmath87",
    "iff they do not have any site in common @xmath88 _ and _ there is no bond linking sites from @xmath85 with sites from @xmath86 .",
    "otherwise the clusters @xmath85 and @xmath86 are said to constitute together a _ linked cluster _",
    "given a disconnected cluster @xmath87 an operator @xmath80 is called _ cluster additive _",
    "iff it can be decomposed as @xmath89    with these definitions we show that @xmath21 and @xmath30 are cluster additive .",
    "but @xmath90 is not !",
    "this will turn out to be another important reason to introduce the @xmath30 .",
    "the cluster additivity of @xmath91 is obvious since @xmath85 and @xmath86 are assumed to be disconnected .",
    "so they can be viewed as physically independent systems .",
    "hence @xmath92 similarly , we deduce from ( [ rekurs ] ) the operators @xmath93 and @xmath94 which act on @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "then it is straightforward to verify that the operators @xmath97 fulfil the recursion ( [ rekurs ] ) for the operators defined for the cluster @xmath79 .",
    "hence the operators @xmath21 and @xmath30 are indeed cluster additive .",
    "it is instructive to see that @xmath90 is _ not _ cluster additive , contrary to what one might have thought .",
    "let us consider the tentative identity @xmath98 this equation can not be true since on the left hand side the number of particles is fixed to @xmath0 while on the right hand side the number of particles to which the identities @xmath99 and @xmath100 are applied is not fixed .",
    "so no cluster additivity is given for the @xmath90 .",
    "the fact that cluster additivity holds only for particular quantities was noted previously for @xmath101 @xcite . for @xmath102 ,",
    "the subtraction procedure was first applied in the calculations in ref .",
    "( though not given in detail ) .",
    "in refs .",
    "the subtractions necessary to obtain the irreducible 2-particle interaction were given in more detail .",
    "the general formalism presented in this article shows on the _ operator _ level why such subtractions are necessary and where they come from .",
    "thereby , it is possible to extend the treatment to the general @xmath0-particle irreducible interaction .",
    "the notation in terms of second quantization ( [ class ] ) renders the cluster additivity almost trivial .",
    "this is so since the creation and annihilation operators are defined locally for a certain site .",
    "it is understood that the other sites are not affected .",
    "hence the same symbol @xmath103 can be used independent of the cluster in which the site @xmath52 is embedded . in particular",
    ", one identifies automatically @xmath104 with @xmath105 if @xmath106 and with @xmath107 if @xmath108 .",
    "hence cluster additivity is reduced to trivial statements of the kind that    @xmath109    implies    @xmath110    in this sense , the notation in second quantization is the most natural way to think of cluster additivity .    following gelfand and co - workers",
    "@xcite we conclude that the cluster additive quantities possess a cluster expansion .",
    "hence all the irreducible matrix elements @xmath78 possess a cluster expansion and can be computed on finite clusters .      since @xmath21 conserves the number of particles , i.e.  eq .  ( [ h_q_com ] ) , its action is to shift existing particles .",

    "the number @xmath113 is the ground state energy of cluster @xmath85 .",
    "the recursive definitions ( [ rekurs ] ) imply    [ t_def ] @xmath119    where @xmath120 comprises six terms resulting from @xmath31 , @xmath121 comprises 18 terms resulting from @xmath32 and @xmath122 comprises 36 terms resulting from @xmath33 .",
    "the explicit formulae are given in appendix [ 3part ] .",
    "the recipe in deriving the above equations is straightforward .",
    "for a given @xmath0-particle process @xmath123",
    "( @xmath124 ) one has to subtract all possible processes which move less than @xmath0 particles . since the @xmath125-particle processes with @xmath73",
    "have been computed before the procedure is recursive .",
    "note that all coefficients must be computed for the _ same _ cluster .",
    "the cluster additivity or , equivalently , the existence of a cluster expansion can be exploited to compute the irreducible matrix elements on finite clusters given that the hamiltonian is of finite range .",
    "there are two strategies to do so .",
    "the first strategy is to choose a cluster large enough to perform the intended computation without finite - size effects .",

    "clearly , @xmath128 depends on the order @xmath127 .",
    "but it depends also on the sites @xmath130 under study so that the notation @xmath131 is appropriate .",
    "note , that the order of the sites does not matter .",
    "if some sites are omitted the constraints for the subclusters @xmath129 are diminished since less sites must be linked .",
    "this implies in particular @xmath132 . hence there can be a cluster @xmath85 which contains @xmath131 but does _",
    "not _ contain @xmath133 so that the hopping matrix element @xmath134 is _ not _ the thermodynamic one , but the interaction @xmath126 is without finite - size correction .",
    "so intermediate steps in the calculations ( [ t_def ] ) can display finite - size effects although the final result does not . in refs .",
    "@xcite we followed this strategy .    the second strategy is to compute for a given order @xmath127 the _ net _ contributions of all clusters @xmath79 with @xmath135 bonds which link the sites under study .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that only smaller clusters need to be treated ( @xmath136 bonds ) .",
    "the price to pay is an overhead in determining the _ net _ contribution .",
    "this requires to deduct from the total contribution of @xmath79 the contributions of all subcluster of @xmath79 with less bonds which link the points under study .",
    "this must be done in order to avoid double counting .",
    "more details on this strategy can be found in ref .  .    for hamiltonians with relatively simple topology ,",
    "the second strategy is more powerful . for more complicated hamiltonians , however , the task to implement the overhead without flaw can quickly become impracticable while the first strategy can still be used , at least up to a certain order of the perturbation .",
    "an effective hamiltonian conserving the number of particles is useful to determine characteristic energies of the considered systems .",
    "but it is not sufficient to determine physical quantities which require more knowledge than the eigen - energies of the system . in particular , we aim at determining dynamic correlations such as @xmath137 . then the mapping of the original hamiltonian @xmath3 to the effective hamiltonian @xmath21 must be extended to a mapping of the original observable @xmath138 to the effective observables @xmath22 . here",
    "we will assume that this has been achieved by an appropriate unitary transformation , for instance in a continuous fashion as described in the introduction .",
    "the structure of the observables can be described best by using the notation of second quantization .",
    "thereby it can be denoted clearly how many particles are involved .",
    "the most important difference compared to the hamiltonian is that there is no particle conservation .",

    "the general structure of the effective hamiltonians and the observables is analysed .",
    "we found that a classification of the various contributions in terms of the number of particles concerned is most advantageous . to this end",
    "we introduced a notation in second quantization which does not , however , require non - interacting fermions or bosons .",
    "generically , hard - core bosons are involved .",
    "we found the formulation in second quantization particularly intuitive .",
    "it provides in a natural way the irreducible quantities on the _ operator level _ which display cluster additivity .",
    "we like to emphasize that the definition of irreducible operators is not a trivial task if a strong - coupling situation is considered as was done in the present paper .",
    "no limit of non - interacting bosons or fermions is assumed .",
    "since the definition of irreducible operators is completely general it allows to compute the @xmath0-particle contribution for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "for instance the formulae for the @xmath274-particle interactions are given for the first time in the literature .",
    "the _ irreducible _ interactions and vertex corrections possess a cluster expansion so that they can be computed on finite clusters provided that the hamiltonian is of finite range .",

    "the technical difficulty arising is to treat the interactions properly , in particular the hard - core constraint .",

    "these differential equations represent renormalization equations for the problem under study .",
    "we call this type of transformation a self - similar one since the _ kind _ of terms retained stays the same . again",
