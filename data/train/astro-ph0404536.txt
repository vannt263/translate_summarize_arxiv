    "whether the universe is spatially finite and what its size and shape may be are among the fundamental open problems that high precision modern cosmology seeks to resolve .",
    "these questions of topological nature have become particularly topical , given the wealth of increasingly accurate cosmological observations , especially the recent results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment  @xcite , which have heightened the interest in the possibility of a finite universe .",
    "indeed , reported non - gaussianity in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps  @xcite , the small power of large - angle fluctuations  @xcite , and some features in the power spectrum  @xcite are large - scale anomalies which have been suggested as potential indication of a finite universe  @xcite ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "given the current high quality and resolution of such maps , the most promising search for cosmic topology is based on pattern repetitions of these cmb anisotropies on the last scattering surface ( lss ) . if a nontrivial topology of space is detectable , then the last scattering sphere intersects some of its topological images giving rise to the so - called circles - in - the - sky .",
    "thus , the cmb temperature anisotropy maps will have matched circles : pairs of equal radii circles ( centered at different points on the lss sphere ) that have the same pattern of temperature variations  @xcite .",
    "these matching circles will exist in cmb anisotropy maps of universes with any detectable nontrivial topology , regardless of its geometry .",
    "therefore , pairs of matched circles may be hidden in cmb maps if the universe is finite , and to observationally probe nontrivial topology on the largest scale available , one needs a statistical approach to scan all - sky cmb maps in order to draw the correlated circles out of them .",
    "the circles - in - the - sky method , devised by n. cornish , d. spergel and g. starkman  @xcite to search for a possible nontrivial topology of the universe , looks for such matching circles through a correlation statistic for sign detection ( a function whose peaks indicate matched circles ) .",
    "as originally conceived , the circles  in  the  sky method did not take into account the role of our galaxy s peculiar motion . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "however , this point has been considered , and it has been argued , in a simplified context ( flat spacetime ) , that , for any observer moving with respect to the cmb , two effects will take place , namely the circles will be deformed into ovals , and these ovals will be displaced with regard to the corresponding circles in the comoving frame . these effects were estimated to be , respectively , of order @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we show here that , regardless of any background curvature or expansion , the shape of these circles  in  the  sky , as locally detected by an observer in motion relative to the comoving one , _ remains _ circular .",
    "we derive explicit expressions for the radius and center position of such an observed circle - in - the - sky , as well as a formula for the angular displacement of points on the circle .",
    "in general , a circle is detected as a circle of different radius , displaced relative to its original position , and centered at a point which does not correspond to its detected center in the comoving frame .",
    "further , there is an angular displacement of points on the circles .",
    "these effects arise all from aberration of cmbr , and exhaust the purely geometric effects due to our galaxy s peculiar motion on circles - in - the - sky .",
    "we also estimate the maximum values of these effects considering the peculiar motion of our galaxy .",
    "in particular , for two back - to - back matching circles in a finite universe the upper bounds in the variation of either their radii , the angular position of their center or in the angular distribution of points are all of order @xmath4 radians .",
    "although these effects are still below wmap s angular resolution , we show that they are relevant for future cmb missions like the planck satellite .",
    "we begin by recalling an old beautiful result by r. penrose  @xcite , according to which , if an observer @xmath5 detects , in his sky - sphere , the shape of an object as circular , then for any other observer @xmath6 locally coinciding with and in motion relative to @xmath5 , the detected shape will remain circular .",
    "the gist of the reasoning is based on the relativistic aberration and the stereographic projection properties , as described in more detail by w. rindler  @xcite : the outline of a spherical object , projected onto the local celestial sphere ( `` sky '' ) of a given observer @xmath5 is certainly circular and , by means of a suitable stereographic projection , is mapped onto a circle in the projection plane ( `` screen '' ) .",
    "now , the aberration formula just transforms this screen for @xmath5 onto a corresponding screen for @xmath6 which is merely globally expanded ( or contracted ) by a factor @xmath7^{1/2}$ ] ; by the corresponding inverse stereographic projection , we thus arrive at the above mentioned penrose s result . as a consequence ,",
    "circles - in - the - sky as detected by the observer @xmath5 will also be detected as circles - in - the - sky by the observer @xmath8 .",
    "the circles will , in general , differ both in position and in size as we shall discuss in detail in what follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be the @xmath10-momentum of an incoming photon in a direction @xmath11 and with frequency @xmath12 as detected by an observer @xmath5 in the hubble flow ( comoving observer ) .",
    "for another observer @xmath8 who moves with velocity @xmath13 relative to this comoving observer , and whose spatial position coincides with that of @xmath5 at the time they measure the cmb , the photon will be detected as incoming in a different direction @xmath14 , and with a distinct frequency @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath10-momentum of this photon for the observer @xmath6 is given by the lorentz transformation @xmath16 where @xmath17 here @xmath18 stands for the @xmath19-dimensional identity matrix , @xmath20 , @xmath21 it the transpose of @xmath13 , and @xmath22 .",
    "thus we readily obtain @xmath23 { \\widehat{\\beta}}}{\\gamma \\left ( 1 + \\vec{\\beta } \\cdot { \\widehat{n } } \\right ) } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation  ( [ doppler ] ) gives the doppler effect , i.e. a shift in frequency due to our galaxy s peculiar motion , responsible for the large dipole moment in the cmb temperature anisotropies and for tiny spectral distortions in the corresponding maps .",
    "equation  ( [ aber ] ) , on the other hand , expresses the relativistic aberration of light , which gives rise to the position displacement and re - scaling as well as the angular displacement of points of the circles - in - the - sky due to the motion of @xmath6 relative to @xmath5 .",
    "we first use  ( [ aber ] ) to determine the center and radius of a lorentz - boosted circle - in - the - sky . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us choose the common axes @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that their positive direction coincides with the direction of the velocity @xmath13 .",
    "thus , from  ( [ aber ] ) , the transformation of the direction of the incoming photon , @xmath26 , reduces to @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the usual spherical coordinates .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be , respectively , the center and radius of a circle @xmath32 in the comoving frame .",
    "we note that the direct use of  ( [ aberesf ] ) to the center @xmath33 of @xmath34 does not furnish , in general , the center @xmath35 of the lorentz - boosted circle @xmath36 , because stereographic projection of a circle @xmath34 is a circle whose center is not , in general , the stereographic projection of the center of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the expressions for the center @xmath37 and the radius @xmath38 of the lorentz - boosted circle @xmath39 we use  ( [ aberesf ] ) to transform the top and bottom points of the circle @xmath34 , given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . as @xmath42 , obviously one has @xmath43 , and the transformed points remain , respectively , the top and bottom points of the lorentz - boosted circle @xmath39 . from  ( [ aberesf ] ) we have @xmath44 for the top point , and a similar expression for @xmath45 . now using some elementary trigonometric relations , after some calculation",
    "we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47                         [ 1+\\beta \\cos(\\theta_c-\\rho ) ] } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    we emphasize that , by using  ( [ aberesf ] ) and  ( [ boostedcircle ] ) , it can readily be verified that the circle - in - the - sky @xmath32 transforms into the circle - in - the - sky @xmath48 , i.e. , the circle equation @xmath49 is invariant under the transformation given by  ( [ aberesf ] ) and  ( [ boostedcircle ] ) . in ( [ circleeq ] )",
    "@xmath50 stands for an arbitrary point in the circle ( cf .",
    "eq.([decomp ] ) below ) .",
    "now , for non - relativistic velocities ( @xmath51 ) , at first order in @xmath52 we have @xmath53    it follows from  ( [ newpos ] ) that for a given circle of radius @xmath31 the displacement @xmath54 of its center is maximum for @xmath55 , i.e. when the vector position of its center in the comoving frame is orthogonal to the boost - velocity @xmath13 . in this case the angular radius @xmath31 remains unchanged as detected by @xmath6 .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath56 clearly is @xmath3 .",
    "thus , two back - to - back circles - in - the - sky in a universe with a nontrivial topology will have a maximum displacement of @xmath57 in the position of their centers .",
    "figure  [ fig : delthe ] shows , for a fixed @xmath52 , the behavior of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath58 for circles of different radii .",
    "it is apparent from this figure , that the maximum absolute value of the angular displacement of the center of the circles depends on their radius but occurs for @xmath55 , while for a circle of angular radius @xmath59 there is no change in the position of the center no matter what the center position is .    #",
    "1#20.5#1    on the other hand , for a given circle @xmath34 of angular radius @xmath31 the change @xmath60 is maximum when the direction of vector position of the center of @xmath34 in the comoving frame is the same direction of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath61 or @xmath62 . in each of these cases",
    "the position of the center of the circle as detected by @xmath6 remains fixed .",
    "we note that when @xmath61 the radius of the circle decreases as detected by the observer @xmath6 , while for @xmath62 it increases ( see also figure  [ fig : cinsk2.eps ] ) .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath63 clearly is again @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : delrho1 ] shows the behavior of @xmath64 as a function of @xmath31 for distinct positions of the centers @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that circles whose vector position of the center is orthogonal to the velocity @xmath13 do not change the radii , while for circles whose vector position is parallel to ( antiparallel ) @xmath52 we have a maximum absolute variation of @xmath31 for any given fixed circle .",
    "clearly for @xmath65 , @xmath64 is a decreasing function of @xmath31 , while for @xmath66 it is an increasing function of @xmath31 .",
    "from  ( [ newradius ] ) we have that for @xmath67 the radius remains unchanged .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath63 obviously is @xmath3 .",
    "thus , two back - to - back correlated circles in a finite universe with a detectable topology will have a upper bound of @xmath57 in the variation of the radii as detected by the moving observer @xmath6 .    #",
    "1#20.5#1    figure  [ fig : cinsk2.eps ] shows the changes in the radii and in the positions of the center of the circles in three instances .",
    "the continuous and dashed circles indicate circles - in - the - sky as detected , respectively , by the observers @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the circles @xmath68 and @xmath69 correspond to a case of maximum change in the position of the center .",
    "clearly in this case the radius @xmath31 remains unchanged at first order in @xmath52 .",
    "the circles @xmath70 and @xmath71 correspond to a case in which the radius of the circle decreases , while @xmath72 and @xmath73 shows a case when the radius increases . in these two last cases the positions of the center of the circles remain unchanged .",
    "the pairs of matching circles @xmath74 and @xmath75 illustrate the instance of maximum change in back - to - back correlated circles - in - the - sky .    #",
    "1#20.4#1    to fully characterize all geometric effects which arise from aberration of cmb on circles - in - the - sky we shall consider now the angular displacement of points on a circle as detected by the observers @xmath5 and @xmath6 . to this end , we decompose a point @xmath76 on a circle @xmath32 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is on the plane of the circle , which is orthogonal to @xmath30 .",
    "the vector @xmath78 is the orthogonal complement of the projection of @xmath50 onto @xmath33 .",
    "we take @xmath79 , the orthogonal complement of the top point @xmath80 of @xmath34 , as a reference from which we measure the angle @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 since clearly @xmath83 .    from  ( [ decomp ] )",
    "one easily has @xmath84 or using the circle equation  ( [ circleeq ] ) to eliminate the dependence on @xmath85 , @xmath86 to calculate @xmath87 it is more convenient to substitute ( [ aberesf ] ) and ( [ boostedcircle ] ) into the analog of  ( [ alpha1 ] ) , for @xmath87 ( which clearly must hold ) and then use  ( [ circleeq ] ) and  ( [ alpha2 ] ) to simplify the expression to @xmath88 where @xmath89 . at first order in @xmath52 equation  ( [ alphaprime ] )",
    "becomes @xmath90    it follows from  ( [ alphaprime2 ] ) that for a given circle of radius @xmath31 the angular displacement @xmath91 is maximum for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath91 clearly is @xmath3 and occurs when simultaneously @xmath92 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . here",
    "again , two back - to - back matching circles in a multiply connected universe will have a upper bound of @xmath57 in the variation of the angular displacement .",
    "figure  [ fig : delalp ] shows the behavior of @xmath91 as a function of @xmath81 for different values of the radii and location of the center of circles .",
    "it is clear from this figure that for any given circles center at @xmath96 the value of maximum angular distortion depend on the radii and centers of the circles but takes place for @xmath93 , while for circles with @xmath31 whose vector position of the centers are parallel ( or antiparallel ) to @xmath13 ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) there is no angular distortion .",
    "# 1#20.4#1    figures  [ fig : cinskphase ] and [ fig : angphase ] illustrate the angular distortion effect . in these figures",
    "it is shown how a set of points uniformly distributed along the circle @xmath32 as detected by the comoving observer @xmath5 will be detected by a locally coinciding observer @xmath6 in the transformed circle @xmath99 .    # 1#20.41#1    # 1#20.45#1",
    "motivated by the fact that our entire galaxy is not in the hubble flow , we have studied all geometric effects due to our galaxy s peculiar motion on the circles - in - the - sky . as a consequence of peronse s result  @xcite",
    "we have shown that circles - in - the - sky as detected by a comoving observer @xmath5 will also be detected as circles - in - the sky by any observer @xmath6 locally coinciding with @xmath5 at the time they measure the cmbr .",
    "in general , a circle for @xmath5 will be detected by @xmath6 as a circle of different radius , displaced relative to its original position , and centered at a point which does not correspond to its detected center in the comoving frame .",
    "we have derived closed explicit expressions for the radius , @xmath38 , the center position , @xmath100 , and the angular displacement @xmath101 of points on the circles as detected by the lorentz - boosted observer @xmath6 . we have also plotted figures to illustrate several instances of these effects .",
    "the maximum displacement in either radius or center or angular position of points on a circle is @xmath102 . from the value @xmath103 obtained from the dipole amplitude in the cmb spectrum",
    ", we have that the maximum displacement for each of these effects individually is @xmath104 .",
    "thus , two antipodal circles whose center vector positions are parallel ( antiparallel ) to @xmath13 will have a difference in radii of @xmath105 , as detected by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is below the current wmap resolution ( at best @xmath106 )  @xcite , but close to planck s ( at least @xmath107 )  @xcite and other more accurate forthcoming missions resolution .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , in a simplified flat spacetime , the spatial positions , relative to a `` moving '' frame , of the events defined by the intersection of the copies of the lss spheres were determined ; of course , these events are simultaneous in the cmb frame and , _ ipso facto _ , are non - simultaneous in the `` moving '' one .",
    "the specific procedure of collecting the spatial positions of these _ non - simultaneous _",
    "events defines , in the `` moving '' frame , an oval figure , whose diameter along the boost direction is _ lorentz - dilated _ , whereas its perpendicular diameter remains unchanged .",
    "briefly , it was shown that a ( spatial ) circle in the cmb frame , as a geometric figure , is formally transformed into a ( spatial ) oval in the  moving  frame of the underlying flat spacetime .",
    "the approach we adopted to the effects of our galaxy s peculiar motion on the circles - in - the - sky is realistic and complete , since it does not rely on such a flat spacetime , and takes into account that a typical observation of the cmbr records simultaneously incoming light rays in an essentially infinitesimal detector used by a local observer , thus implying their projection onto the sky - sphere .",
    "we note that the aberration of cmbr might be of a more general interest in the analysis of maps of cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "indeed , consider the celestial sphere pixelized by a comoving observer @xmath5 and consider another observer @xmath6 coinciding with @xmath5 and with relative velocity @xmath13 along the positive @xmath24 direction .",
    "the coordinates @xmath108 of the @xmath109th pixel in the comoving frame are transformed to the moving frame according to  ( [ aberesf ] ) , which , at first order in @xmath52 , simply reads @xmath110 this displacement of the centers of the pixels gives rise to a distortion on the temperature variation pattern in cmb maps , which might be relevant for future missions .    finally , we emphasize that all these effects arise from aberration of the cmbr , and exhaust the purely geometric effects due to the motion of our galaxy ( or cmbr detectors ) .",
    "it is again worth noting that , since aberration of light is a purely local phenomenon , the effects considered in this work depend neither on the background curvature of space nor on the expansion of the universe .",
