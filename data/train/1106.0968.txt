    "behavior of manganese is very special both in the bulk and cluster forms .",
    "the electronic configuration of the atom has a half filled 3@xmath2 shell and filled 4@xmath3 shell .",
    "structural and magnetic properties of manganese clusters have been studied in the past.@xcite it has been shown @xcite that small mn - clusters containing up to 4 - 5 atoms exhibit ferromagnetic coupling of individual atomic magnetic moments with a magnetic moment per atom comparable with the magnetic moment of mn at the atomic limit , which is 5 @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the coupling becomes ferrimagnetic as the cluster size increases and the net magnetic moment falls abruptly as shown in the experimental works @xcite and also supported by the first principles studies.@xcite the atom centered individual magnetic moment , though , remains of the order of atomic moment .",
    "therefore , it will be of great technological interest if the ferrimagnetic coupling can be transformed into ferromagnetic , thereby resulting into a giant magnetic moment . one way to accomplish",
    "this is by doping.@xcite furthermore , if the doping also increases the stability of the cluster compared to the pure mn - cluster of same size , then it will be an additional achievement on top of _",
    "spin engineering_. such clusters will be promising building block for making new cluster assembled materials . along the same line of thought , rao and jena @xcite previously studied the structure and magnetism of n - capped mn clusters . based on their study carried out on mn clusters of size upto 5 mn atoms , they proposed that n - capping can be used as a viable means to enhance both the stability and the ferromagnetic coupling among mn atoms in a mn - cluster . in the present work ,",
    "we have proposed an alternative route and studied systematically the effect of substitutional doping of mn@xmath0 cluster to produce mn@xmath1x clusters with x = ti , v , cr , fe , co , ni atom .",
    "we find that ti and v substitutions are the most effective as both the magnetic moment and stability increase significantly for the mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters compared to the pure mn@xmath0 cluster . to compare our finding with the proposal of rao and jena@xcite through n - capping ,",
    "we have also studied the structure and electronic properties of mn@xmath0n cluster .",
    "although , the n - capping enhances the stability and magnetic moment compared to the pure mn@xmath0 cluster , the gain in total magnetic moment is found to be smaller compared to that of mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters .",
    "also the substitutional ti - doping and v - doping are more interesting since they keep the volume of the cluster intact as opposed to n - capping which increases the volume of the original clusters .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "section ii describes the computational details .",
    "section iii summarizes the results obtained in our study .",
    "this section consists of five sub - sections .",
    "the sub - section a is devoted to the results describing pure mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "the sub - sections b and c are devoted to results on mn@xmath1x clusters . in sub - section d",
    ", we analyze the origin of enhanced stability and magnetic moments in mn@xmath1x clusters .",
    "sub - section e describes our comparative study on n capped mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "we end the paper with a conclusion in section iv .",
    "our calculations have been performed using density functional theory , within the pseudo - potential plane wave method as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _",
    "simulation package.@xcite we have used the projector augmented wave pseudo - potentials @xcite and perdew - bruke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional @xcite for spin - polarized generalized gradient approximation .",
    "the wave functions were expanded in the plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off of 270 ev and reciprocal space integrations were carried out at the @xmath5 point .",
    "symmetry unrestricted geometry optimization has been performed using the conjugate gradient and the quasi - newtonian methods until all the force components became less than a threshold value of 0.005 ev /  .",
    "though the noncollinear effect of atomic spins is significant for mn - clusters , it has been shown in the earlier work @xcite that for mn@xmath0 cluster , the degree of noncollinearity is very small .",
    "therefore , we have optimized the structures for all the spin multiplicities @xmath6 under the approximation of _ collinear _ atomic spins arrangement to determine the magnetic moment of the minimum energy structure .",
    "simple cubic super - cells were used with the periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters were kept separated by at least 12  vacuum space to make the interaction between the cluster images negligible .",
    "the binding energy ( @xmath7 ) of each mn@xmath1x cluster has been calculated with respect to the free atoms as @xmath8 where @xmath9(mn@xmath1x ) , @xmath9(mn ) and @xmath9(x ) are the total energies of the mn@xmath1x cluster , an isolated mn atom and an isolated @xmath10 atom respectively .",
    "we also have analyzed the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) for the magnetic clusters by defining the spin gap as follows :    @xmath11\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta_2 = - \\left[\\epsilon^{\\rm minority}_{\\rm homo } - \\epsilon^{\\rm majority}_{\\rm lumo}\\right ] \\label{spingap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the system is considered to be stable if both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive .",
    "detailed discussion about @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be found elsewhere.@xcite",
    "since the transition metal clusters generally prefer compact geometry to maximize the interaction between the rather localized @xmath14 orbitals,@xcite we have considered icosahedral , cube - octahedral and hexagonal closed pack ( hcp ) structures as the most probable starting geometries to determine the minimum energy structure ( mes ) for mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "these three are the most compact and highly coordinated structures for the 13 atoms cluster .",
    "each structure was allowed to relax for _ all possible _ collinear spin configurations of the atoms .",
    "fig.1 shows the variation of total binding energy as a function of total magnetic moments for these three structures of mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "we found an icosahedral structure with total magnetic moment of 3 @xmath4 and total binding energy of 28.023 ev is the mes for the mn@xmath0 cluster , as predicted earlier.@xcite an icosahedron of 13 atoms can be viewed as consisting of two pentagonal rings connected with each other through the central atom and capped with two apex atoms at its ends as shown in fig .",
    "we also observed a spin segregated state of atomic moments in the mes of mn@xmath0 cluster in the sense that the atoms within each of the two pentagonal rings of icosahedral mn@xmath0 cluster are ferromagnetically aligned , while the two pentagonal rings are anti - ferromagnetically coupled with each other ( cf .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous report by another group.@xcite      for the calculations reported in the following , we have considered doped mn@xmath1x clusters of the icosahedral symmetry with the impurity @xmath10 atom sitting at the center of icosahedron and optimized it for _ all possible _ collinear spin configurations of atoms .",
    "we have considered six different substitutions at the central mn site of mn@xmath0 cluster : considering the substituting @xmath10 atom as one of the three elements left of mn in the periodic table ( ti , v , cr ) and of the three elements right of mn in the periodic table ( fe , co , ni ) .",
    "this assumed geometry of icosahedral symmetry with the impurity @xmath10 atom sitting at the center of icosahedron needs some discussion . in our earlier work on v - doped co clusters,@xcite",
    "we have also shown by ab - initio molecular dynamic study that the ground state structure of co@xmath1v cluster , adopts an icosahedral pattern with the substituting v - atom always preferring to sit at the central site of icosahedral co@xmath1v cluster .",
    "theoretical works on clusters with isosahedral symmetry with substitution at the central site have been reported for mco@xmath1 ( m = ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni ) clusters,@xcite fe@xmath1x ( x = be , o , mg , al , si , s , ti , mn , fe , ni , zn , se , pd ) clusters,@xcite and al@xmath1x ( x = b , al , ga , c , si , ge , ti , as ) clusters@xcite . therefore , there exists enough reports in the literature considering the substitution at the central site by atoms of similar or larger sizes , justifying our choice of the impurity @xmath10-atom doped at the central site of icosahedral mn@xmath0 cluster . furthermore ,",
    "as discussed later in section iii.d , mn - x dimers were found to have higher binding energies compared to mn@xmath15 dimer .",
    "this in turn would indicate that single atom substitution of mn by x atom will prefer a configuration where the number of mn - x bonds are maximized , which is possible for the substitution at the central position . our total energy calculations by putting the substituting atoms at different sites of the icosahedral mn@xmath16 cluster support this idea .",
    "fig.3 shows the plot of binding energies as a function of total magnetic moments ( n@xmath17 - n@xmath18 ) of all the mn@xmath1x clusters . in order to see the effect of substitutional doping",
    "distinctly , we have plotted the binding energy for each spin multiplet of mn@xmath1x clusters with respect to that of the mes for pure mn@xmath0 cluster _ i.e _",
    ". positive value of this quantity means gain in binding energy upon substitutional doping .",
    "it is seen from fig.3(a ) that gains in binding energies are achieved in case of ti and v substitutions for a range of values of total magnetic moments , from @xmath21 2 @xmath4 to @xmath2150 @xmath4 , while for cr - substitution there is no gain in binding energy except a small gain for the magnetic moments of 22 @xmath4 and 10 @xmath4 . on the other hand , for fe , co and",
    "ni substitutions , there is also gain in binding energy for each of them upto a total magnetic moment of around 30 @xmath4 as seen from fig.3(b ) .",
    "notice that these gains are not as high as we observed in case of ti and v substitutions .",
    "however , they are better than the cr - substitution .",
    ".[table1]total binging energies and total magnetic moments ( m ) of the minimum energy icosahedral structures of mn@xmath1x clusters , x = ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ table1 ] shows the total binding energies and total magnetic moments of the mess of mn@xmath1x clusters . it is seen that the mess of all the doped clusters have higher binding energies and magnetic moments as compared to those of the mes for mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "we note again that the mess of the mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters have significantly higher binding energies than mn@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the total magnetic moments are found to be significantly large for the mess of clusters doped with elements to the left of mn in the periodic table .",
    "moreover , there are several isomers [ as seen from fig .",
    "3(a ) ] of mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters with total magnetic moment in the range of 3 - 50 @xmath4 , which have gain in binding energies compared to the mes of pure mn@xmath0 cluster . combining the results of fig.3 and table 1",
    ", it is therefore seen that the substitutional ti - doping as well as v - doping of the mn@xmath0 cluster are the most preferable in view of gaining significant amount of both the binding energy and the total magnetic moment .",
    "for the mes of mn@xmath1cr cluster , although the gain in magnetic moment is quite significant , the gain in binding energy is the least .",
    "similarly , mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters also have some isomers with total magnetic moments in the range of around 3 - 30 @xmath4 [ as seen from fig .",
    "3(b ) ] , which have both gains in binding energy and magnetic moment with respect to those of the mes for pure mn@xmath0 cluster . however , the mess for mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters have total magnetic moments of 8 @xmath4 , 7 @xmath4 and 8 @xmath4 respectively , which are higher than that of the mes for mn@xmath0 cluster too , but significantly lower than that of the mess for mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters . in order to have a visual depiction of the trend in the choice of substituting elements in a concise manner , the binding energies and magnetic moments of the mess of mn@xmath1x clusters with respect to those of the minimum energy pure mn@xmath0 cluster respectively _ i.e _ e@xmath19(mn@xmath1x)@xmath20 - e@xmath19(mn@xmath0)@xmath20 and m(mn@xmath1x)@xmath20 - m(mn@xmath0)@xmath20 are plotted in fig.[diff ] .    in fig.[dos ] , we have plotted the total density of states and center atom projected density of states of the mes of each mn@xmath1x cluster . as is seen from fig.[dos ] , the difference between the majority and minority spin states is large for the optimal icosahedral mn@xmath1ti , mn@xmath1v and mn@xmath1cr clusters , which results in large magnetic moments for these clusters . on the other hand , the magnetic moments for the optimal icosahedral structures of mn@xmath0 , mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co , mn@xmath1ni clusters are relatively small ,",
    "as the majority and minority spin states mostly cancel each other .",
    "center - atom projected density of states shows that it has finite but small magnetic moment in case of mess of mn@xmath1ti , mn@xmath1v and mn@xmath1cr clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "its magnetic moment is vanishingly small for the mess of mn@xmath0 , mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters .      to understand the relative stability of the doped mn@xmath1x clusters , we have computed the binding energies of mnx dimers as given in table ii and also plotted the spin gaps [ as defined in eq.[spingap ] ] for the mess of the mn@xmath1x clusters in fig.[spingap2 ] .",
    "our calculated binding energies for dimers follow the same trend as we observed in case of clusters .",
    "it is seen from table ii that mnti dimer has the maximum binding energy of 3.14 ev .",
    "again the binding energy of mnv dimer ( @xmath21 2.72 ev ) is also quite high .",
    "therefore , the large gains in binding energies of mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters come from the large binding energies of mnti and mnv dimers respectively . on the other hand , the mnfe , mnco and mnni dimers also have large binding energies compared to that of the mn@xmath15 dimer .",
    "consequently , the mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters also have larger binding energies compared to the pure mn@xmath0 cluster .    0.2 cm    ccccccc dimers & & & & + & & present & ref .",

    "our calculated values follow the similar trend as obtained from the reported values for both bondlenghts and binding energies of the dimers . however , we note that the reported binding energies in ref .",
    "26 show the least value for mncr dimer and followed by mn@xmath15 dimer , while our calculated binding energies for dimers show the least value for mn@xmath15 dimer , followed by mncr dimer . in order to verify our calculation for mncr dimer ,",
    "we have also performed the calculation for cr@xmath15 dimer .",
    "our calculated binding energy and bond length for cr@xmath15 dimer are 2.08 ev and 1.59  respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the experimental values for cr@xmath15 dimer.@xcite considering a mixed dimer with mn and cr , then the corresponding values for the mncr dimer should be in between the corresponding values of the two pure dimers - mn@xmath15 and cr@xmath15 .",
    "our calculated values of binding energy and bond length for mncr dimer follow this trend .",
    "both the spin gaps ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) as plotted in fig.[spingap2 ] , are also positive for all the clusters studied here indicating the formation of stable clusters .",
    "we find that the mess of mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters have large positive value of @xmath22 s , which in turn , again indicate the high stability of the mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters compared to the others .",
    "2.0 cm    to understand the magnetic behavior of the mess of the mn@xmath1x clusters , we have calculated the atom - centered magnetic moments within a specified sphere around each atom of the mess of doped mn@xmath1x clusters and pure mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "[ spin_barplot ] shows the pictorial representation of our analysis .",
    "focusing first on the individual moments , we find that the moments of all the atoms for each cluster remain close to the atomic moment ( @xmath21 3 - 4 @xmath4 ) with the exception of the highly coordinated central atom ( atomic index 13 ) which has a small magnitude for all the mn@xmath1x clusters .",
    "it is therefore the alignment of individual moments of the surface atoms which plays the major role in determining the total magnetic moment of the mess of the mn@xmath1x clusters . in case of doping with atom of elements left of mn in the periodic table ( i.e for the mn@xmath1ti , mn@xmath1v and mn@xmath1cr clusters )",
    ", it is seen that the surface mn - atoms are mostly ferromagnetically aligned .",
    "for example , only the moments of two surface atoms are antiferromagnetically aligned with the moments of other surface atoms in case of mess for mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters .",
    "similarly , moments of three surface mn atoms are antiferromagnetically aligned with the moments of other surface atoms in case of the mes for mn@xmath1cr cluster . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface mn atoms are mostly antiferromagnetically coupled among themselves in case of substitution with atom of the elements right of mn in the periodic table ( i.e for mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters ) and the net magnetic moment for each of these clusters is small , close to the total magnetic moment of two ferromagnetically coupled mn atoms which is 10 @xmath4.@xcite    1.7 cm    we further find that the magnetic moment of the central atom , though it is small compared to that of the surface atoms for each doped cluster , varies from one doped cluster to another .",
    "it shows a systematic increase as one moves from mn@xmath1ti@xmath23mn@xmath1v@xmath23mn@xmath1cr and attains tiny values for mn@xmath0 , mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni .",
    "the moment at the central site is decided by two factors - ( i ) gradual filling of electronic states in moving from left to right of the periodic table and ( ii ) the hybridization with neighboring atoms .",
    "the gradual filling of electronic states should increase the moment in moving from ti to v to cr attaining a maximum value for the half - filled case of mn , followed by a gradual decrease in moving from fe to co to ni . while the above mentioned trend is observed for the central atom of mn@xmath1ti , mn@xmath1v and mn@xmath1cr clusters , the moments for the central atom are all tiny for mn@xmath0 , mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters , in contrast to the electron filling trend which would demand the moment to be the maximum for mn@xmath0 .",
    "this is , however , explained by the second effect , namely the hybridization effect",
    ". as the bond length decreases , generally the magnetic moment also decreases through the increase in effective hybridization . in order to examine the effect of hybridization , we have , therefore , calculated the centre to surface average distance for the mess of all the seven mn@xmath1x clusters with x = ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni .",
    "[ bondlength ] shows the plot of our calculation .",
    "we find the average bond lengths to grow in moving from mn@xmath1ti to mn@xmath1v to mn@xmath1cr and then dropping suddenly to a smaller value for mn@xmath0 which stays as smaller value for mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters also .",
    "the hybridization effect therefore takes over the filling effect in producing small magnetic moment at the central sites for mn@xmath0 as well as mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni .",
    "therefore , we find that the central atom behaves as magnetic atom in case of mn@xmath1ti , mn@xmath1v and mn@xmath1cr clusters , while it behaves as essentially nonmagnetic atom in case of mn@xmath0 , mn@xmath1fe , mn@xmath1co and mn@xmath1ni clusters . considering the alignment of moments for both the surface atoms as well as central atom , we can then conclude that when the central atom is magnetic , the surface mn - atoms are mostly antiferromagnetically coupled with the central atom , causing the effective ferromagnetic coupling among the surface atoms which gives rise to large total magnetic moment of the clusters . on the other hand , when the central atom is nonmagnetic , the surface magnetic moments interact with each other through super - exchange path involving the central nonmagnetic atom , resulting into antiferromagnetic coupling within each other .",
    "this gives rise to a small net magnetic moment of the whole clusters .",
    "finally , in order to see the effect of n - capping in mn@xmath0 cluster along the same direction of ref.12 , we have also studied the structure , stability and magnetic properties of an icosahedral mn@xmath0n cluster with n atom at a triangular face cap as shown in the inset of fig.[figmn13n ] . to determine the magnetic moment of the mes and to identify the possible isomers close to mes , we have again optimized the structure for _ all possible _ collinear spin configurations of atoms .",
    "we find an icosahedral structure of total magnetic moment of 12 @xmath4 is the mes for mn@xmath0n cluster .",
    "we also find that the mn - n - mn bond angles of n atom with the three nearest mn - atoms in case of the mes of mn@xmath0n cluster , are 90.08@xmath24 , 93.95@xmath24 and 90.97@xmath24 .",
    "this nearly 90@xmath24 bond angle between mn - n - mn has been predicted as guiding rule for the ground state structure of n - caped mn - clusters in the earlier work.@xcite it results from the interaction of the @xmath25-orbitals of n - atom with the @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridized orbitals of mn atoms . as the n atom",
    "is added , the binding energy of mn@xmath0n cluster improves significantly compared to that of the mes for pure mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "the energy gained in adding a n atom to mn@xmath0 cluster , is defined as @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "0.3 cm    fig.[figmn13n ] shows the variation of @xmath27 as a function of total magnetic moment of the mn@xmath0n cluster .",
    "the mes of mn@xmath0n cluster has binding energy gain @xmath27 = 6.42 ev .",
    "there are also several closely lying isomers with total magnetic moments of 22 @xmath4 , 10 @xmath4 and 2 @xmath4 which are 4 mev , 10 mev and 14 mev away from that of the mes respectively .",
    "so @xmath27 s for them are also very close to that of the mes .",
    "these values of @xmath27 s are consistent with the energy - gain predicted in ref.12 for mn@xmath28 cluster , which is 5.61 ev . in the earlier work , @xcite it has been shown that addition of one n - atom to at least five mn atoms is energetically favorable . here we see that addition of single n atom is also energetically favorable even for the mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "this enhancement in bonding due to n - addition has been demonstrated earlier@xcite by examining the bonding in case of dimer - mn@xmath15 versus mn@xmath15n .",
    "lack of hybridization between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons due to filled 4@xmath3 shell of mn prevents mn@xmath15 from forming a strong bond . as n",
    "is attached , the 4@xmath29 electrons of mn interact with the 2p@xmath30 electrons of n resulting in strong coupling .",
    "the inset of fig.[figmn13n ] shows the orientations of atomic spins of the minimum energy structure of magnetic moment 12 @xmath4 and the first isomer of magnetic moment 22 @xmath4 of mn@xmath0n cluster .",
    "the local effect of n - capping in now very obvious .",
    "effectively , it couples the atomic spins ferromagnetically in the triangular face where it sits as well as in the pentagonal ring nearest to it ( upper pentagonal rings of the two structures in the insets of fig.[figmn13n ] ) .",
    "therefore , two pentagons for each of the two structures ( mes and the closely lying first isomer ) in the inset of fig.[figmn13n ] , are now effectively ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "so in addition of enhancing binding , n - capping also increases the magnetic moment compared to that of the pure mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "however , it is significantly lower than that of the mess for mn@xmath1ti and mn@xmath1v clusters , presumably due to the fact that n - capping produces a local effect while the ti or v substitutions at the central site effects all the other 12 surface atoms thereby producing a global effect .",
    "total magnetic moment of a mn@xmath0 cluster is small due to anti - ferromagnetic alignment of individual atomic moments .",
    "our study shows that it is possible to obtain stable ferromagnetic alignment of atomic spins by substitutional ti - doping and v - doping in mn@xmath0 cluster resulting into giant total magnetic moment .",
    "we have compared our findings with the previously proposed route of @xmath31-capping to mn - clusters .",
    "the gain in magnetic moment compared to pure mn@xmath0 cluster is found to be more in case of ti and v substitutions .",
    "also substitutional doping keeps the volume of the parent cluster intact , while the n - capping increases the effective volume of the cluster .",
    "therefore , we propose ti - substitution and v - substitution as promising alternative to engineer the magnetic structure for mn@xmath0 cluster .",
