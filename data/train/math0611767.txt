    "we call an essential disk @xmath13 in @xmath7 _ primitive _ if there exists an essential disk @xmath21 in @xmath12 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 have a single transverse intersection in @xmath24 .",

    "let @xmath13 be a primitive disk with a dual disk @xmath25 .",

    "next , let @xmath313 be a 3-ball cut off from @xmath7 by @xmath314 , and let @xmath315 be the subgroup of elements of @xmath316 which preserve @xmath313 . since the union of @xmath24 with the six disks @xmath298 and @xmath299 , for @xmath293 , separates @xmath301 into ( four ) 3-balls , @xmath315 can be identified with the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the 3-holed sphere @xmath317 , which preserve @xmath318 and @xmath319 respectively .",

    "it turns out that @xmath327 is a 2-complex and each edge of @xmath327 lies on a single 2-simplex .",
    "thus @xmath327 deformation retracts naturally to a graph @xmath328 in which each 2-simplex in @xmath327 is replaced by the cone on its three vertices , and akbas @xcite showed that @xmath328 is a tree .",
    "we observe that the reducing spheres for @xmath336 correspond exactly to the reducing pairs in @xmath7 up to isotopy .",
    "that is , a reducing sphere cuts @xmath7 into two unknotted solid tori , whose meridian disks are primitive in @xmath7 .",
    "conversely , a reducing pair has a unique pair of disjoint dual disks , as in lemma 2.2 , and the corresponding reducing sphere is the boundary of a small regular neighborhood of the union of either of the disks with its dual .",
    "it is routine to check that two reducing spheres represent two vertices connected by an edge in @xmath327 if and only if the corresponding reducing pairs are contained in a reducing triple .",
    "so the correspondence from reducing spheres to reducing pairs determines a natural embedding of @xmath327 into @xmath6 so that the image of @xmath328 is identified with the tree @xmath8 ( see fig .",
