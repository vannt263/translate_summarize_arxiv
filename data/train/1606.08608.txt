    "ngc  225 ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; webda database ) is a sparsely populated and not a well - studied open cluster .",
    "its age determined by @xcite from photographic measurements and a recently revised study by @xcite do not agree with each other .",
    "the limited number of observations , which are from older photographic measurements and some 2mass data , motivated us to observe and study ngc 225 by contemporary ccd technology at optical wavelengths .",
    "proper motions and approximate photographic visual magnitudes of the stars in the field of ngc  225 were first given by @xcite .",
    "first precise @xmath0 photographic and photoelectric measurements of the cluster were performed by @xcite , who also constructed @xmath15 vs @xmath4 colour - magnitude ( cmd ) and @xmath3 vs @xmath4 two - colour diagrams ( tcd ) .",
    "@xcite measured the reddening for the cluster as @xmath16 mag using the data presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the spectral classes for a number of stars in the field of the cluster , for which the photoelectric magnitudes were already given by @xcite , and measured the reddening , the distance modulus and the distance of the cluster as @xmath17 mag , @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 pc , respectively .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath20 equivalent widths of the brighter stars in the field of the cluster photoelectrically and determined their spectral classes .",
    "the distance modulus of the cluster were estimated as @xmath21 mag .",
    "but , later when @xcite catalogued open clusters its distance was re - established again , where the reddening , uncorrected the distance modulus , the distance and the apparent diameter of the cluster were given as @xmath17  mag , @xmath22  mag , @xmath19  pc and @xmath23  arcmin , respectively .",
    "@xcite investigated ngc  225 in detail and determined 28 probable member stars of the cluster according to the proper motions measured in their study .",
    "they had used the photographic plates taken in @xmath24 and @xmath15 bands for estimating its age , reddening and distance as @xmath25  myr , @xmath26  mag and @xmath27  pc , respectively .",
    "almost one and a half decades later , the cluster was studied by @xcite , who re - estimated the cluster parameters using photographic @xmath0 and two micron all sky survey s @xmath28 photometry ( @xmath29 , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated the age of the cluster differently as @xmath30  myr and argued that its age is not 120  myr as already suggested by @xcite . strengthening this conclusion they proposed that two herbig be stars with @xmath31 emission ,",
    "dust lanes and nebulosity exist in the vicinity of the cluster implying possible results of recent star formation .    in this study , we report our conclusions extracted from our ccd @xmath0 observations of ngc  225 .",
    "our report includes the mean radial velocity ( rv ) of the cluster measured from low - resolution optical spectra of some brighter stars of ngc  225 . from these data",
    ", we have calculated the cluster s astrophysical and kinematical parameters .",
    "using the proper motions of the stars , we have estimated their probabilities of being physical members of the cluster .",
    "we find the reddening and metallicity of the cluster following two independent methods .",
    "its distance modulus and age were inferred by fitting stellar isochrones to the observed cmds , while keeping the reddening and metallicity constant @xcite .",
    "we have summarized the observations and the data reductions in section 2 .",
    "the cmds , structural parameters of ngc  225 , and the membership probabilities of the stars in the cluster field were presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we measure the astrophysical parameters of the cluster .",
    "section 5 discusses the results .",
    "ccd @xmath0 observations of ngc  225 were carried out on 18th july 2012 using the 1 m ritchey - chrtien telescope ( t100 ) located at the tbitak national observatory ( tug ) in bakirlitepe , antalya / turkey . a composite @xmath15-band image taken with a total exposure time of 30  s",

    ", we first performed a test - particle integration in a milky way potential which consists of a logarithmic halo , a miyamoto - nagai potential to represent the galactic disc and a hernquist potential to model the bulge .",
    "we calculated galactic orbits of the eight cluster stars with a membership probability larger than 50@xmath34 for which rv data are given in table  6 .",
    "mean values of the rv , proper motion components of these stars and the distance of the cluster were taken as the input parameters for the cluster s galactic orbit estimation : @xmath35 km s@xmath2 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 mas yr@xmath2 , and @xmath38 pc , respectively .",
    "@xcite measured the rv of lmm 88 ( bd+60  86 ) as @xmath39 km s@xmath2 , which is very different than the value in table 6 .",
    "therefore , this star was excluded from the calculation of the mean rv of the cluster , since it is probably a spectroscopic binary .",
    "the proper motion components were taken from @xcite , while the rvs of the cluster stars and their distances were found in this study .",
    "we determined galactic orbits of the stars within an integration time of 3  gyr in steps of 2  myr .",
    "this integration time corresponds to minimum 12 revolutions around the galactic center so that the averaged orbital parameters can be determined reliably .    in order to determine the galactic orbit of the cluster",
    ", we adopted means of the orbital parameters found for the stars as the orbital parameters of the cluster .",
    "13 shows the representations of galactic orbits calculated for the cluster stars and the cluster itself in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 planes . here ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are heliocentric galactic coordinates directed towards the galactic centre , galactic rotation and the north galactic pole , respectively .",
    "we obtained the cluster s apogalactic ( @xmath45 ) and perigalactic ( @xmath46 ) distances as @xmath47 and @xmath48  kpc , respectively . the maximum vertical distance from the galactic plane is calculated as @xmath49  pc .",
    "we used the following formula in the determination of the eccentricity projected on to the galactic plane : @xmath50 .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit was calculated as @xmath10 .",
    "this value shows that the cluster is orbiting the galaxy with a period of @xmath51  myr on nearly circular orbit as expected for the objects in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we also computed the galactic space velocity components of the stars in table  6 with respect to the sun using the algorithms and transformation matrices of @xcite .",
    "the input data in table  6 are in the form adopted for the epoch of j2000 as described in the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) of _ hipparcos _ and tycho catalogues @xcite .",
    "the calculated space velocity components are @xmath52 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainties of these components were computed by propagating the uncertainties of the input data ( proper motions , distance and rv ) with an algorithm also by @xcite .",
    "we applied corrections for the differential galactic rotation to the space velocity components as described in @xcite .",
    "we also corrected the galactic space velocity components for the local standard of rest ( lsr ) by adding the space velocity of the sun to the space velocity components of the stars .",
    "the adopted space velocity of the sun is @xmath53 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we adopted means of the space velocity components found for the stars as the space velocity components of the cluster .",
    "finally , the corrected space velocity components of ngc  225 were found as @xmath54 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we estimated the total space velocity of the cluster as @xmath55 km s@xmath2 , which is in agreement with the one suggested for the young thin - disc stars and young stellar clusters @xcite .     50@xmath34 , for which rvs are available , in the @xmath40 ( a ) and @xmath41 ( b ) planes .",
    "the cluster s mean orbit is indicated with a blue line .",
    "the black plus , red circle and green triangle symbols in panel ( a ) represent the galactic centre , and current locations of the sun and ngc 225 , respectively . ]",
    "in this paper , we present the first ccd @xmath0 photometry for the open cluster ngc  225 . from these data , we determined structural and astrophysical parameters of the cluster .",
    "we also calculated the mean rv of the cluster from the spectroscopic observations of the cluster members .",
    "using the proper motions of the stars in the field , we estimated probability of the stars in the cluster field being physical members of the cluster .",
    "we also calculated the space velocity components and the parameters of the galactic orbit of ngc  225 .",
    "independent methods developed for the determination of the reddening and metallicity were used in this study to reduce the number of free parameters in the simultaneous solutions , where the theoretical stellar evolutionary isochrones are fitted to the observed cmds , since the astrophysical parameters of a cluster suffer from the reddening - age degeneracy when all of them ( the reddening , metallicity , distance modulus and the age ) are simultaneously determined by this fitting process ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "thus , we inferred the reddening of the open cluster ngc  225 from its @xmath3 vs @xmath4 tcd , while we determined the metallicity of the cluster utilizing f0-g0 spectral type main - sequence stars @xcite via a metallicity calibration defined by @xcite .",
    "the reddening and metallicity of the cluster obtained from the @xmath0 photometric data are @xmath56 mag and @xmath6= -0.11\\pm 0.01 $ ] dex ( @xmath57 ) , respectively .",
    "this is the first determination of the metallicity for ngc  225 . while keeping the reddening and metallicity constant , we inferred the distance modulus and age of the cluster as @xmath58 mag and @xmath59  myr , respectively , by fitting the theoretical isochrones to the observed cmds .",
    "from the estimated distance modulus and the colour excess , we find the distance of ngc  225 as @xmath60  pc , which is in agreement with that found by @xcite within errors .",
    "a comparison of the reddening values with those estimated in previous studies shows that the colour excess obtained in this study is smaller than @xmath61  mag given by @xcite and @xcite , while it is in agreement roughly with @xmath62  mag found by @xcite within errors .",
    "the distance modulus obtained in this study @xmath63 mag is in agreement with the previous estimates of @xmath18 and @xmath64  mag @xcite within errors , as well .",
    "we compared the spectral types and membership probabilities estimated in our study with those in @xcite .",
    "the comparison is shown in table 7 .",
    "stars in the table 7 are indicated as the most probable members of the cluster by @xcite .",
    "an inspection by eye shows that spectral types and membership probabilites in the two studies are generally in agreement .",
    "differences between the probabilites are due to the proper motion accuracies of the catalogues used in the two studies .",
    "since we have taken the proper motion values from @xcite , proper motion errors in our study are smaller than those in @xcite , indicating that the membership estimated in our study are more reliable .    as for the age of ngc  225 , @xcite estimated the age of the cluster as @xmath65 myr , while @xcite argued that the age should be @xmath30 myr based on pre - main sequence isochrones .",
    "however , we found age of the cluster to be much older than both determinations as @xmath66  myr by fitting the theoretical isochrones provided by the parsec synthetic stellar library @xcite , which was recently updated ( parsec version 1.2s , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , to the observed @xmath15 vs @xmath3 and @xmath15 vs @xmath4 cmds in this study .",
    "@xcite show that there are eight stars with h@xmath67 emission located around the cluster , of which two are probable herbig be stars ( lkh@xmath67  201 and bd  + 61  154 ) located within the cluster s field .",
    "according to @xcite , these two stars indicate that the age of ngc  225 is 1.5@xmath683.0  myr , if they are members of the cluster .",
    "the re - reduced _ hipparcos _ parallax of bd  + 61  154 is @xmath69 mas @xcite .",
    "this value compares to the cluster s parallax ( @xmath70 mas ) only within 2@xmath71 error level .",
    "it should be noted that the gaia observations will reveal if this star is a member of the cluster .",
    "@xcite calculated the distance of lkh@xmath67  201 as @xmath72 pc and showed that the star is behind the cluster .",
    "so , lkh@xmath67  201 is not a member of ngc  225 , as well .",
    "thus , we conclude that presence of these stars in the field of the cluster is just a coincidence .    in addition ,",
    "lkh@xmath67  200 was also used by @xcite to show that the cluster is very young . however , the membership probabilities of lkh@xmath67  200 and lkh@xmath67  201 are estimated to be 0% in our study as well as in @xcite ( see table 7 ) .",
    "thus , lkh@xmath67  200 can not be used in the estimation of the cluster s age , as well .",
    "the rvs of a considerable number of stars in the direction of ngc  225 were measured for the first time in this study ( table 2 ) .",
    "a mean rv of @xmath73 km s@xmath2 was calculated for the cluster .",
    "a search in the literature for stars in table 2 shows that there are only two stars , whose rvs were previously measured .",
    "@xcite determined the rvs of lmm  88 ( bd+60  86 ) and lmm  115 ( bd+60  91 ) as @xmath74  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath75  km  s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "our rv measurement for lmm  115 ( @xmath76  km  s@xmath2 ) is in a perfect agreement with that of @xcite , while an agreement between the two studies could not be found for lmm  88 ( @xmath77  km  s@xmath2 ) as this star is likely a spectroscopic binary .    in order to determine the galactic orbit of the cluster",
    ", we adopted means of the galactic orbital parameters found for the cluster stars , whose rvs were obtained currently from their spectra , as the galactic orbital parameters of ngc  225 .",
    "the maximum vertical distance from the galactic plane , eccentricity and period for the galactic orbit of ngc  225 were calculated as @xmath78  pc , @xmath79 and @xmath11  myr , respectively .",
    "@xcite calculated these parameters as @xmath80  pc , @xmath81 and @xmath82 myr which are in agreement with our estimates .",
    "we obtained the cluster s apogalactic and perigalactic distances as @xmath83 and @xmath84  kpc , respectively .",

    "the space velocity components of ngc  225 with respect to the galactic centre were determined as @xmath85  km  s@xmath2 in this study , where the @xmath15 component for galactic rotation velocity of the sun ( @xmath86 km s@xmath2 ) was used as the correction term .",
    "then , the total space velocity of the cluster is estimated @xmath87  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite calculated the uncorrected space velocity components of ngc  225 as @xmath88 km s@xmath2 which give a total space velocity of @xmath89 km s@xmath2 .",
