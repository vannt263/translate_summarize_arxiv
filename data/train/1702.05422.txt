    "in the last decades , drinkable water scarcity is progressively becoming a critical issue in several countries @xcite .",
    "hence , desalination technologies have been gradually attracted increasing scientific and commercial interest . however , current desalination processes are generally energy - intensive and designed for large installations , thus requiring high capital costs @xcite .",
    "more sustainable and energy efficient desalination methods should be then investigated to meet the increasing fresh water needs @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a modular and low - cost distiller is suggested , modeled and tested .",
    "here , modularity stems from the possibility of realizing multiple evaporation / condensation processes ( referred to as _ stages _ in the following ) , conveniently under isobaric ambient conditions , and without the need of any ancillaries : as a result , the proposed distiller is totally static .",
    "the realized lab - scale prototype can be powered by low - grade energy ( among others , non - concentrated thermal solar energy ) , and it automatically provides a continuous flow of fresh water from salty ones .",
    "we experimentally assess preliminary performance of a single- and a multi - stage ( here @xmath0stage ) lab - scale distiller . a theoretical model ( here properly validated against experiments )",
    "is used to infer the distillate production rate obtainable by larger devices , in terms of both the number of stages and inlet water salinity .",
    "the experimental setup considered for evaluating the performance of the proposed distiller is depicted in figure [ figure1 ] . testing facilities consist in a laptop , a data acquisition ( daq ) board ( _ national instruments _ ) , a power supplier , a scale ( balance ) and a small distiller prototype .",
    "stage prototype of the proposed distiller . ]",
    "three thermocouples connected with the daq - board allow to record the ambient temperature and the temperature drop across the distiller .",
    "the scale is used to monitor the mass change in the fresh water basin ( marked with ( 6 ) in the figure [ figure1 ] ) ; whereas a refractometer has been used to measure salt concentration both in the salt water basin ( marked with ( 7 ) in the figure [ figure1 ] ) and certify purity of fresh water during operations .      in figure",
    "[ figure1 ] , the basic working principle and main elements of a @xmath1stage distiller ( marked with ( 8) ) are schematically reported .",
    "our prototype consists of two highly thermally conductive thin plates ( here , aluminum squares with size @xmath2 cm^2^ ) , each supporting a thin layer of hydrophilic material ( here , @xmath3 mm thick ) . while wet , the aforementioned hydrophilic layers are only communicating through their vapor phase and have the ability of keeping separated the two liquid phases .",
    "the latter liquid separation can be achieved either using hydrophobic micro - porous membranes ( as commonly done in membrane distillation - md ) or leaving a small air gap between the hydrophilic layers ( membrane - free solution ) .",
    "specifically , we will work with both approaches .",
    "as an example , for practical purposes , the air gap can be easily imposed by inserting a thin rigid spacer with large porosity between the hydrophilic layers .",
    "alternatively , a frame at the boundary of the thin metallic plates , with thickness larger than the two hydrophilic layers , can also be used to ensure the gap without compromising on the vapor mass flux ( reduced by spacer porosity ) . clearly , all possible combinations including both hydrophobic membranes and air gaps are also possible .",
    "possibly , the distillation process can be driven by solar radiation converted into heat by commercially available highly absorbent materials ( e.g. tinox^^ @xcite ) .",
    "the latter solar absorber may be also covered by a transparent thermal insulator ( e.g. bubble wrap layer , as done in @xcite ) to reduce convection losses .",
    "tinox^^ may be a convenient choice as it guarantees limited infrared emissivity and thus radiative losses .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , here a planar electrical resistance is embedded in the distiller just beneath the tinox^^ layer , to mimic solar energy deposition . moreover ,",
    "only experiments with energy flux well below one - sun ( i.e. @xmath4 ) are carried out in order to reproduce realistic conditions where optical losses are also present .",
    "finally , a heat sink is placed at the bottom of the distiller , aiming at rejecting low - temperature heat to the ambient which acts as a low - temperature thermostat .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in our work , the heat sink purposely operates under natural convection so that it does not require any additional power supply .",
    "interestingly , regardless of the adopted approach for separating the two liquid phases held by the hydrophilic layers ( air gap or membranes ) , a multistage configuration can be easily designed and realized by adding a series of identical stages to the above set - up : this is schematically reported in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "hence , in addition to the @xmath1stage configuration , a @xmath0stage configuration of the distiller has also been realized and experimentally tested .",
    "we finally stress that , in possible future applications of the proposed distiller for floating installations , a natural choice for the low - temperature thermostat could be sea water itself . owing to enhanced heat transfer",
    ", the latter is expected to deliver even better performance as compared to the current one operated in air .",
    "the mechanism underlying the distillation process of the @xmath1stage distiller depicted in figure [ figure1 ] is detailed below . here",
    ", the top hydrophilic layer is labeled with ( e ) , which stands for evaporator ; whilst the hydrophilic layer at the bottom is labeled with ( c ) , which stands for condenser .",
    "a snapshot of half a stage is reported in figure [ figure3]a .",
    "most of the hydrophilic thin material is glued to an aluminum plate .",
    "such a layer is also endowed with an hydrophilic stripe which is responsible of mass transport from / to the stage . under operating conditions ,",
    "salty water naturally rises from the basin ( 7 ) to the top hydrophilic layer ( e ) due to capillarity . the thermal power from the top , through the aluminum plate , heats up the salty water in the hydrophilic layer ( e ) , therefore promoting vapor flux in the gap or through the micro - porous membranes ( if any ) . due to a difference in the vapor pressure , driven by a temperature difference",
    ", a net water flux is established towards the hydrophilic layer ( c ) , where water condensation happens and the corresponding latent heat becomes available to drive additional stages ( in the multi - stage configuration ) .",
    "an increasing amount of distillate water accumulates and is finally guided by the hydrophilic layer ( c ) into the fresh water basin ( 6 ) by gravity .    during our tests ,",
    "hydrophilic layers were separated by :    * air gaps imposed by polypropylene spacers with large porosity ( figure [ figure3]b ) ; * hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with pore size of 0.1 @xmath5 m and thickness of @xmath6 ( figure [ figure3]c ) * hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with pore size of 3.0 @xmath5 m and thickness of @xmath6 ( figure [ figure3]d )    our prototypes were mainly realized for proof - of - concept purposes and our realizations were all far from optimal .",
    "hence , prototypes with membranes also included small air gaps and polypropylene spacers .",
    "m or ( * d * ) 3.0 @xmath5 m , polytetrafluoroethylene . ]    finally , we notice that when using hydrophobic micro - porous membranes the pore size is critical for avoiding liquid water entry .",
    "in other words , as it is well known in md applications , the smaller the pore size the higher the liquid entry pressure - lep . however , as we are operating under isobaric ( ambient ) conditions , even a large size of the pores ( as in figure [ figure3]d ) is not problematic for our purposes .",
    "the driving force of the observed distillation process is the difference in water vapor pressure due to both temperature and salinity on the layer surfaces @xcite .",
    "the vapor pressure gradient is defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes water activity ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mass fractions ( @xmath11 ) of salt in the feed or permeate solution , respectively ; @xmath12 is the vapor pressure of water ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the temperatures of the feed and permeate solution , respectively .",
    "the activity of a water / nacl solution can be approximately estimated by the raoult s law as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 for nacl , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the molar masses ( expressed in [ g / mol ] ) of sodium chloride and water , respectively .",
    "the feed water processed in the experiments is a water / nacl solution that mimics seawater salinity , namely 35",
    "g / l ( @xmath19 ) ; therefore , equation ( [ raoult ] ) predicts @xmath20 . on the other side ,",
    "the activity of permeate solution is equal to 1 ( i.e. distilled water ) .",
    "the vapor pressure can be computed via the antoine s semi - empirical correlation : @xmath21 where a , b and c are the component - specific constants , and in this case estimated as 8.07 , 1730.63 and 233.42 , respectively .",
    "the specific mass flow rate ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 $ ] ) is proportional to the partial pressure gradient via the permeability coefficient of the gap : @xmath24 when hydrophilic layers are separated by an air gap , the permeability ( @xmath25 ) coefficients can be easily estimated as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the porosity of a spacer possibly inserted between the two layers ( see figure [ figure3]b ) , @xmath28 $ ] is the vapor diffusion coefficient in air at the mean temperature of a stage ( @xmath29 $ ] ) , @xmath30 is the gas constant ( @xmath31 $ ] ) , @xmath32 is the air gap thickness while @xmath33 its average temperature in kelvin .",
    "as shown in equation ( [ pgap ] ) , the gap thickness is crucial and it strongly affects the permeate flux .",
    "clearly , in equation ( [ pgap ] ) , @xmath34 if the air gap is realized without spacers . in order to achieve high permeability and thus high mass fluxes , a trade - off between heat ( to be minimized ) and mass ( to be maximized ) transport between the layers is to be found @xcite .",
    "when hydrophobic membranes are used , more advanced formulas are typically adopted to estimate the permeability coefficient @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the heat flux ( @xmath35 ) between the two hydrophilic layers is mainly due to water phase chance and conduction heat transfer : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective thermal conductivity in the gap including conduction through air and possible spacer or membrane , whereas @xmath38 is the latent heat of vaporization ( @xmath39 [ kj / kg ] for water ) .",
    "a number of experiments have been performed to investigate the heat and mass transfer phenomena in the proposed distiller . in all experiments",
    ", a lab - scale device is heated by a heat flux of @xmath40 [ w / m^2^ ] , here conveniently provided by a planar electrical resistance thus mimicking realistic operation conditions under one - sun ( including some optical losses ) . finally , we discuss the results of a one - dimensional numerical model implementing the equations introduced in section [ theo ] , to validate the experimental results .",
    "the mass fluxes of distilled water were obtained by measuring the mass change over time in the fresh - water basin ( sampling period : @xmath41 minutes ) .",
    "each experiment was replicated twice to test the reproducibility .",
    "distillate fluxes for a single stage distiller are presented in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "the air gap configuration produced a mass flow rate of @xmath42 [ g / m^2^/h ] ( see black square in the figure [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "the gray triangle is the corresponding value as predicted by the theoretical one - dimensional model . on the other hand ,",
    "the configurations with the hydrophobic membranes produced @xmath43 [ g / m^2^/h ] ( blue circle ) and @xmath44 [ g / m^2^/h ] ( red triangle ) in case of @xmath45 and @xmath46 pore sizes , respectively .",
    "( blue circle ) ; membrane with pore size @xmath46 ( red triangle ) .",
    "modeling result : air gap configuration ( gray triangle ) . in the inset ,",
    "a schematic of the tested single stage distiller is depicted . ]    in addition , the experimental results for the @xmath0stage distiller is presented in figure [ figure5 ] ( green square ) , together with the modeling results as a function of both the number of stages and feed water salinity ( color lines ) .",
    "a three - fold increase of the experimental mass flow rate is observed ( and theoretically predicted ) by a @xmath0stage configuration . in summary ,",
    "the distiller produced up to @xmath47 [ g / m^2^/h ] . without loosing generality ,",
    "the experimental test of the @xmath0stage configuration has been conducted using hydrophobic membranes with pore size 3 @xmath48 .",
    "similar tests can be also conducted using a multi - stage configuration with air gaps separating hydrophilic layers or membranes with different pore size .",
    "stage air gap configuration ( black square ) ; @xmath1stage membrane configuration , with pore size @xmath45 ( blue circle ) ; @xmath1stage membrane configuration , with pore size @xmath46 ( red triangle ) ; @xmath0stage membrane configuration , with pore size @xmath46 ( green square ) .",
    "modeling results : membrane configuration with pore size @xmath46 and 35 [ g / l ] ( red solid line ) , 70 [ g / l ] ( blue dashed line ) or 135 [ g / l ] ( black dash - dot line ) nacl concentration . ]    the results obtained with the one - dimensional model , validated by the @xmath1 and @xmath0stage experimental results , show a rather linear scaling of the permeate flux as a function of the number of stages up to a threshold which varies with feed water salinity . beyond this threshold",
    ", the distiller performance gradually decays due to a reduction in the temperature difference across each distillation stage , which is gradually less effective in counteracting the difference in vapor pressure caused by salinity .",
    "three thermocouples were used to monitor the ambient temperature and the temperature drop between the top and bottom of the distiller . in figure",
    "[ figure6 ] , we plotted the temperature profiles obtained in the considered experiments . across the @xmath1stage setup , the temperature gradient is close to @xmath49 , whilst in the case of a @xmath0stage configuration a @xmath50 was observed .    stage .",

    "in this work , we presented a modular , low - cost and passive ( i.e. only driven by non - concentrated thermal solar energy ) device able to desalinate seawater exploiting the vapor pressure difference across a small gap between two hydrophilic thin layers . in our experiments , we observe that this process can be efficiently operated by a thermal power density less than @xmath51 and maximum temperature @xmath52 celsius .",
    "different gap separation means of the hydrophilic layers have been realized and experimentally tested , namely : air gap , hydrophobic membranes with pore size of 0.1 @xmath48 , and hydrophobic membranes with pore size of 3 @xmath48 .    with a sub - optimal realization ,",
    "the device with best performance delivered a distillate mass flux of @xmath53 [ g / m^2^/h ] in a @xmath1stage configuration , whereas in a @xmath0stage configuration we observed a three - fold increase , namely @xmath54 [ g / m^2^/h ] .",
    "experimental results also served to validate a one - dimensional theoretical model of the proposed distiller .",
    "this model was used to predict the distillate mass flux as a function of the number of stages and salinity .",
    "the numerically predicted trend has been found to be almost linear up to a threshold ( which depends on the feed water salinity ) .",
    "beyond such a threshold , the distiller performance decays because of a lower temperature difference across each stage , which is gradually less effective in counteracting the vapor pressure difference imposed by salinity .",
    "we finally note that the temperature drop across the distiller might be increased by adopting a concentrated solar source . in this case",
    ", the distiller could eventually process feed water with higher salinity . however",
    ", this would also imply a higher degree of complexity due to optical concentration .",
