    "remarkably , a similar peak - valley structure was also found by the recent first - principles calculations in cucr@xmath24se@xmath25br@xmath26 compound @xcite .",
    "the ane of this compound was recently measured by lee et al .",
    "@xcite as a function of br doping @xmath159 which is used to change the chemical potential @xmath12 . due to the scarce data available , until now the peak - valley structure of @xmath157 revealed in fig .",
    "6 and in ref .",
    "@xcite has not been found in experiment , and more direct experimental results are needed for quantitative comparison with the theoretical results .",
    "interestingly , the expression for @xmath157 can be simplied at low temperature as the mott relation @xcite , @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the derivative of hall conductivity with respect to the zero - temperature chemical potential ( fermi energy ) @xmath23 .",
    "thus one can see that unlike ahe , ane is given by the fermi - surface contribution of the band structure and berry curvature .",
    "another unique feature of @xmath157 is its linear dependence of temperature .",
    "finally , let us consider the response of the om to the external magnetic field @xmath162 .",
    "it should be noticed that the above semiclassical theory is carried out up to the first order in the external perturbation @xcite .",
    "thus our discussion is valid in the weak magnetic field . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) one obtains the magnetic susceptibility of the om , @xmath163 \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\equiv\\chi_{\\text{o}}^{(c)}+\\chi_{\\text{o}}^{(\\omega)}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , the first conventional term @xmath164 describes the fermi - surface contribution to @xmath165 and thus will disappear in the insulating region . whereas the second term @xmath166 denotes the berry phase correction . clearly , to calculate @xmath167 all the occupied states within the fermi level should be taken into account .",
    "therefore , the berry phase correction will give a fundamental contribution to @xmath165 in the insulating region for the systems with nonzero chern number .",
    "of the _ kagom _ lattice , and ( b ) its two components contributed from @xmath1 ( red curve ) and @xmath2 ( blue curve ) as a function of the electron chemical potential @xmath12 for @xmath3=@xmath139 and @xmath147=@xmath141 . ]    figures 7(a)-(b ) show the orbital magnetic susceptibility and its two components as a function of the chemical potential , respectively . from fig .",
    "7(b ) one can see that the conventional part @xmath164 always displays the paramagnetic property , while the berry phase correction contributes a diamagnetic response to @xmath162 .",
    "again , in the metallic regions , the total magnetic susceptibility is dominated by its conventional part and thus displays the paramagnetic feature .",
    "whereas in the insulating regions the nonzero @xmath165 comes solely from the berry phase correction and displays the diamagnetic feature .    up to now , we have concentrated on the ferromagnet represented by the double - exchange model .",
    "as ohgushi et al . @xcite have pointed out , the present theory is also applicable to the ferromagnet based on the hubbard model .",
    "furthermore , the spin - orbit coupling gives the spin anisotropies , which introduces the tilting of the spins from the perfect ferromagnetic alignment as assumed in eq .",
    "the present 2d _ kagom _ lattice may be relevant to the recent experiments on pyrochlore compounds r@xmath24mo@xmath168o@xmath29 @xmath169r = nd , sm , gd@xmath170 @xcite , which are itinerant ferromagnets on the verge of a mott transition on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "it can be expected that easy - axis spin anisotropy in these compounds produces the spin chirality by the symmetry consideration .",
    "thus the present results of the om properties may be verified in such systems .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the properties of om and its effects in the 2d spin - chiral ferromagnetic _ kagom",
    "_ lattice .",
    "the spin chirality parameter @xmath3  in the lattice produces nonzero chern number and results in profound effects on the om properties .",
    "we have found that the two parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 in om opposite each other , and yield the paramagnetic and diamagnetic responses respectively . in particular , due to its chern - number property , the magnetic susceptibility of @xmath2 remains to be a nonzero constant when the fermi energy is located in the energy gap of the _ kagom _ lattice .",
    "it has been further shown that the om displays fully different behavior in the metallic and insulating regions , because of different roles @xmath1 and @xmath2 play in these two regions .",
    "the anomalous nernst conductivity has also been studied , which displays a peak - valley structure as a function of the electron chemical potential .",
    "the experiments on ferromagnets are urgently expected to realize these interesting theoretical results .",
