    "we call chemical evolution of galaxies the study of how the chemical elements formed in stars and were distributed in galaxies . during the big bang only the light elements ( h , d , he , li ) were synthesized , while stars have been responsible for the formation and distribution of all the elements from carbon to uranium and beyond . some light elements , such as li ,",
    "be and b are formed during the spallation process , which is the interaction between the cosmic rays and c , n , o atoms present in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "therefore , stars produce chemical elements in their interiors by means of nuclear reactions of fusion and then restore these elements into the ism when they die .",
    "the fusion reactions occur up to @xmath0 which is the element with the maximum binding energy per nucleon . for elements heavier than @xmath0 the nuclear fusion",
    "is therefore inhibited and the nuclear fission is favored .",
    "the stars are born , live and die and they can die in a quiescent fashion like white dwarfs or violently as supernovae ( sne )",
    ". the supernovae can be of various types : core - collapse sne , namely the explosion of single massive stars ( @xmath1 , type ii , ib , ic ) , and type ia sne , namely the explosion of a white dwarf occurring after accreting material from a companion in a binary system .",
    "in this lecture i will first describe the ingredients necessary to build galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "such models can be analytical or numerical and they aim at following the evolution in time and space of the abundances of the chemical elements in the ism .",
    "then , i will focuse on some highlights in the galactic chemical evolution and on the comparison models - observations . in doing so",
    ", i will show how chemical evolution models can constrain stellar nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation timescales .",
    "the basic ingredients necessary to build a chemical evolution model are :",
    "the `` yield per stellar generation '' of a single chemical element , can be defined as ( tinsley 1980 ) :    @xmath16    where @xmath10 is the mass of the newly produced element @xmath11 ejected by a star of mass @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the returned fraction .",
    "the yield @xmath19 is therefore the mass fraction of the element @xmath11 newly produced by a generation of stars relative to the fraction of mass in remnants ( white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes ) and never dying low mass stars ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we define `` returned fraction '' the fraction of mass ejected into the ism by an entire stellar generation , namely : @xmath21    the term fraction originates from the fact that both @xmath19 and @xmath18 are divided by the normalization condition of the imf , namely : @xmath22    in order to define @xmath19 and @xmath18 we have made a very specific assumption : the instantaneous recycling approximation ( ira ) , which states that _ all stars more massive than 1@xmath13 die instantaneously , while all stars less massive live forever_. this assumption allows us to solve the chemical evolution equations analytically , as we will see in the following , but it is a very poor approximation for chemical elements produced on long timescales such as c , n and fe . on the other hand , for oxygen , which is almost entirely produced by short lived core - collapse sne , ira is an acceptable approximation . in figure 1 we show @xmath23 and @xmath18 , computed for different initial metallicities of the stars and different imfs .",
    "as one can see , the dependence of these quantities on z is negligible whereas that on the imf is strong . in that figure",
    "it does not appear the kroupa(2001 ) universal imf , suggesting that the imf in stellar clusters is an universal one .",
    "kroupa ( 2001 ) imf is a two - slope imf with a slope for stars more massive than 0.5@xmath13 very similar to that of the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , still widely used in model for external galaxies .",
    "the simple model of chemical evolution assumes that the system is evolving as a closed - box , without inflows or outflows , the imf is constant in time , the chemical composition of the gas is primordial and the mixing between the chemical products ejected by stars and the ism is instantaneous , plus ira .",
    "the initial gas mass is therefore , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fractionary mass of gas , the metallicity is @xmath26 is zero at the time t=0 .",
    "the basic equations can be written as : @xmath27 which describes the evolution of gas and where the integral is the rate at which dying stars restore both the enriched and unenriched material into the ism at the time @xmath28 .",
    "the equation for metals is :    @xmath29 \\psi(t-\\tau_m ) \\varphi(m)dm},\\ ] ]    where the first term in the square brackets represents the mass of pristine metals which are restored into the ism without suffering any nuclear processing , whereas the second term contains the newly formed and ejected metals ( maeder 1992 ) .",
    "when ira is assumed , the sfr can be taken out of the integrals and the equation for metals be solved analytically .",
    "its solution is : @xmath30    the metallicity yield per stellar generation @xmath31 which appears in the above equation is known as _ effective yield _ , simply defined as the yield @xmath32 that would be deduced if the system were assumed to be described by the simple model .",
    "therefore , the effective yield is : @xmath33    clearly , the true yield @xmath31 will be always lower than the effective one in both cases of winds and infall of primordial gas . the only way to increase",
    "the effective yield is to assume an imf more weighted towards massive stars than the canonical imfs .",
    "we define primary element an element produced directly from h and he a typical primary element is carbon or oxygen which originate from the 3-@xmath34 reactions we define secondary element an element produced starting from metals already present in the star at birth ( e.g. nitrogen produced in the cno cycle ) .",
    "we recall that the solution of the chemical evolution equations for a secondary element , with abundance @xmath35 , implies : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the yield per stellar generation of the secondary element .",
    "this means that , for a secondary element the simple closed - box model predicts that its abundance increases proportionally to the metallicity squared , namely :    @xmath38",
    "in the case of a model with outflow but no inflow occurring at a rate : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a free parameter larger than or equal to zero , the solution for the metallicity of the system is :    @xmath41.\\ ] ]    it is clear that in the case of @xmath42 the solution is the same as that of the simple model .    in the case of a model without outflow but inflow of primordial gas ( @xmath43 ) , occurring at a rate : @xmath44 with @xmath45 a positive constant different from zero and from 1 , the solution is : @xmath46.\\ ] ] again , if @xmath47 , the solution is the same as that of the simple model .",
    "the case @xmath48 is a particular one , called `` extreme infall '' and it has a different solution : @xmath49 where @xmath50 . for a more extensive discussion of these and other analytical solutions",
    "see matteucci ( 2012 ) .",
    "when the stellar lifetimes are correctly taken into account the chemical evolution equations should be solved numerically .",
    "this allows us to follow in detail the temporal evolution of the abundances of single elements .    a complete chemical evolution model in the presence of both galactic wind",
    ", gas infall and radial flows can be described by a number of equations equal to the number of chemical species : in particular , if @xmath51 is the mass of the gas in the form of any chemical element @xmath11 , we can write the following set of integer - differential equations which can be solved only numerically , if ira is relaxed :    @xmath52 dm}+\\\\ \\nonumber ( 1-a_b)\\int_{m_{bm}}^ { m_{bm}}{\\psi(t-\\tau_{m})q_{mi}(t-\\tau_{m)}\\varphi(m)dm}+\\\\ \\nonumber \\int_{m_{bm}}^{m_u}{\\psi(t-\\tau_m)q_{mi}(t-\\tau_m ) \\varphi(m)dm } + x_{ia}(t ) a(t)\\\\ \\nonumber   - x_{i}(t ) w(t ) +   x_{i}(t)i(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 can be substituted by @xmath53 , namely the surface gas density of the element @xmath11 . in several models of chemical evolution",
    "it is customarily to use normalized variables which should be substituted to @xmath54 or to @xmath55 , such as for example : @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) being the total surface mass density ( mass ) at the present time @xmath60 .",
    "the surface densities are more indicated for computing the chemical evolution of galactic disks , while for spheroids one can use the masses .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 represents the abundance by mass of the element @xmath11 and by definition the summation over all the mass abundances of the elements present in the gas mixture is equal to unity .",
    "these equations include the products from type ia sne ( third term on the right ) and the products of stars ending their lives as white dwarfs and core - collapse sne ( for a more extensive description of the equations see matteucci , 2012 ) .",
    "in this section we will illustrate some examples where predictions from chemical evolution models are compared to observations .",
    "we will start with the milky way , which is the galaxy for which we possess the majority of information . a good model for the chemical evolution of the milky way should reproduce several constraints , including the g - dwarf metallicity distribution , the [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h]= @xmath62 relations ( where x is a generic element from carbon up to the heaviest ones ) , abundance and gas gradients along the galactic disk , among others .    in figure 2",
    "we show the predictions from romano et al .",
    "( 2010 ) concerning several chemical elements obtained by using different sets of stellar yields and compared to observation in stars .",
    "as one can see , the agreement is good for some chemical species whereas for others the agreement is still very poor .",
    "the reason for that probably resides in the uncertainties still existing in the theoretical stellar yields .",
    "the shapes of the [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation can be successfully interpreted as due to the _ time - delay model _ , namely the fact that elements such as c , n and fe are mainly produced by long living stars , while others such as @xmath34-elements ( o , mg , si , ca ) are produced by short living stars . in particular , fe is mainly produced by type ia sne and only a small fraction of it originates in core - collapse ( cc ) sne .",
    "type i a sne explode on longer timescales than core - collapse sne and therefore ratios such as [ @xmath34/fe ] , where @xmath34 indicates @xmath34-elements which are mainly produced in cc sne , can be used as cosmic clocks .",
    "the higher than solar value of the [ @xmath34/fe ] ratios for low [ fe / h ] values , is then due to the cc sne which restore the @xmath34-elements on short timescales . when type ia sne , originating from co white dwarfs which have longer lifetimes ( from 30 myr up to a hubble time ) , start restoring the bulk of fe , then the [ @xmath34/fe ] ratios start decreasing . by means of the time - delay model we can interpret any abundace ratio .",
    "the model underlying the predictions of figure 2 is an updated version of the two - infall model by chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : this model assumes that the milky way formed by means of two main gas accretion episodes , one during which the halo and thick disk formed and another during which the thin disk formed on much longer timescales .      in figure 3 we show an illustration of the so - called li - problem .",
    "in particular , we report the abundance of @xmath63 ( a(li ) = 12 + log(li / h ) versus [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the data sources are indicated inside the figure . the upper envelope of the data should represent the evolution of the abundance of @xmath63 in the ism since the stars in the upper envelope should exhibit the li abundance present in the gas when they formed .",
    "the stars below should instead have consumed the original li which is very fragile and tends to react with protons to form @xmath64 when the temperature is @xmath65 k. according to this interpretation of the diagram , the younger stars with higher [ fe / h ] should reflect the fact that the li abundance has increased with galactic lifetime owing to li stellar production by stars . stars which can create , preserve and eject li into the ism are : low and intermediate mass stars during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , the cc sne , cosmic rays and perhaps novae ( see izzo et al .",
    "2015 for the possible detection of li in a nova ) .",
    "the li problem arises from the fact that both wmap and planck experiments have derived a primordial @xmath63 abundance higher than the abundance found in the upper envelope of the galactic halo stars ( those with [ fe / h]@xmath66 -1.0 in figure 3 ) .",
    "this could mean that the oldest galactic stars have consumed their primordial li and roughly by the same amount for stars in the range -3.0  -1.0 in [ fe / h ] ( the so - called spite plateau ) .",
    "the lines in figure 3 represent the predictions of a chemical evolution model ( the two - infall model ) including sne , novae , cosmic rays and agb stars as li producers and starting from the primordial li abundance deduced either by wmap or by the value of the spite plateau .",
    "there is not yet a solution for the li - problem .     for solar vicinity stars and meteorites ( symbols ;",
    "see legend ) compared to the predictions of chemical evolution models ( lines and colored areas ) .",
    "the chemical evolution model is from romano et al .",
    "( 2010).the black line represents all the stellar li producers , as described in the text .",
    "the red line is the same model but without novae .",
    "note that the dotted theoretical curve starts with the primordial li value from wmap which lies well above the li abundances of halo stars.figure from izzo et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . ]      in figure 4 we show the model predictions and data for the ufd galaxy hercules , a small ( with stellar mass of @xmath67 ) satellite of the milky way .",
    "the data refer to the [ ca / fe ] ratios measured in the stars of this galaxy and include also the data for ca in the milky way and dwarf spheroidal stars .",
    "the data show that the milky way and hercules evolved in a different way , since the [ ca / fe ] ratios are lower at the same [ fe / h ] in the ufd galaxy , relative to the milky way .",
    "the models , computed with an efficiency of star formation one thousand times lower than assumed for the milky way can well reproduce the trend .",
    "the model for hercules includes also a strong galactic wind proportional to the sfr . because of the already mentioned time - delay model , the fe delayed production coupled with a regime of slow star formation predict that the [ ca / fe ] ratios are lower . at the same [ fe / h ] , since when the type ia sne start to be important in producing fe , the ca and the other metals produced by cc sne have not yet attained the same abundances as in the miilky way which evolves with a much faster star formation .",
    "ratios as functions of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the red stars represent abundances in stars of hercules , while the blue points represent dwarf spheroidals and black points the milky way .",
    "the red lines are models assuming a star formation efficiency ( @xmath9 ) varying in the range 0.002 - 0.008 @xmath68 .",
    "figure from koch et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . ]",
    "therefore , in order to interpret the abundance patterns in galaxies we should consider the history of star formation , since it affects strongly the shape of the [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations . in this way",
    ", we can reconstruct the history of stars formation in galaxies just by looking at their abundances .",
    "this approach is known as _",
    "astroarchaeological approach_. from figure 4 it apprears that the dwarf spheroidals have a higher star formation efficiency than the ufds but a lower one than the milky way . from this figure",
    "it is difficult to conclude that stars of the ufds could have been the building blocks of the galactic halo , but more data on ufds are necessary before drawing firm conclusions on this point .",
