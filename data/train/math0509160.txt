    "interpolation via splines of degree @xmath1 with simple knots has been considered for different boundary conditions that the spline interpolant is required to satisfy ( see e.g. [ schoenberg 1964a ; 1964b ] and [ nrnberger 1989 , pages 116 - 123 ] .",
    "one particular aspect of these problems is that the @xmath7-th derivative of the spline interpolant gives the minimal @xmath8-norm among all functions that are smooth enough and satisfy the same boundary conditions ( see e.g. [ de boor 1964 ; 1974 ] , [ holladay 1957 ] , [ schoenberg 1964a ; 1964b ; 1964c ] , [ nrnberger 1989 ] ) . in the particular case of",
    "_ complete _ and _ natural _ interpolation of elements in the sobolev space @xmath9 via a spline of a given degree @xmath1 , this optimality property was a good starting point to prove that the the @xmath10-norm of the interpolation error is independent of the locations of the knots ( see [ shadrin 1992 ] and the references given there ) .",
    "we recall here that given a function @xmath11 on @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath12 and @xmath13 an integer , a spline @xmath14 with degree @xmath1 and ( simple ) knots @xmath15 is the complete spline if and only if @xmath16 minimizes @xmath17 over all functions @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 and is the natural spline if and only if @xmath16 minimizes @xmath17 over all functions @xmath18 satisfying @xmath20 ( see e.g. [ holladay 1957 ] , [ de boor 1964 ; 1974 ] , [ schoenberg 1964a ; 1964b ; 1964c ] , [ shadrin 1992 ] ) .",
    "natural cubic splines ( @xmath21 ) go back at least to [ holladay 1957 ] .",
    "[ holladay 1957 ] was apparently the first to prove that the unique spline that satisfies the conditions in ( [ naturcond ] ) , and such that it is a cubic polynomial to the left and to the right of @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively is equal to the natural spline interpolant .",
    "in general , a natural spline @xmath14 of degree @xmath24 admits a polynomial extension of degree @xmath1 to the left and right of the boundary points @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively ; i.e. , @xmath25 ( see e.g. [ schoenberg 1964a ; 1964b ; 1964c ] , [ nrnberger 1989 ] ) .    if we fix the number of knots , and take @xmath26 to be the maximal distance between two successive knots , it follows from theorem 6.4 of [ shadrin 1992 ] that there exists @xmath27 ( depending only on @xmath7 ) such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 , and @xmath14 is either the ( corresponding ) natural or complete spline interpolant ( [ shadrin 1992 ] makes this assertion for @xmath31 in the sobolev space @xmath32 , but via a standard sobolev embedding theorem ( see e.g. [ adams and fournier , 2003 ] , pages 80 , 85 ) this implies the stated inequality ) .",
    "the result provides bounds that are independent of the locations of the knots @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath11 is @xmath4 $ ] , and @xmath14 is its complete spline interpolant then @xmath34 a bound that [ de boor 1974 ] had conjectured for @xmath35 . in connection with the previous bound , [ de boor 1974 ] found that it was sufficient to show boundedness of the supremum norm of the @xmath8-projector of @xmath36 $ ] on the space of splines of degree @xmath37 with knots @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , de boor conjectured that there exists some constant @xmath39 ( depending only on @xmath7 ) such that for any nontrivial function @xmath11 in @xmath36 $ ] @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath11 on the space of splines of degree @xmath37 with knots @xmath15 , equipped with the ordinary inner product @xmath42 ( see also [ shadrin 2001 ] ) . apparently , de boor had conjectured such a result for the first time in 1972 ( [ de boor 1973 ] )",
    ". however , the conjecture remained unsolved for more than 25 years before [ shadrin 2001 ] found a proof .",
    "the bound in ( [ linfbound ] ) combined with the techniques developed by [ de boor 1974 ] for bounding interpolation error implies that there exists @xmath43 depending only on @xmath44 and @xmath7 such that @xmath45 for all functions @xmath46 .",
    "the latter can obviously be viewed as a special case of ( [ shadineq ] ) , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "however , the bound in ( [ linfbound ] ) makes the inequality in ( [ shadineq ] ) valid for @xmath50 as well , and hence it provides a stronger result .",
    "let @xmath51 be a fixed integer , and consider @xmath52 . given a function @xmath11 defined on @xmath6 $ ] and at least differentiable at the @xmath53 points @xmath54 for @xmath55 , we denote by @xmath56 the unique spline of degree @xmath1 with ( simple ) knots @xmath57 that satisfies the @xmath58 linear conditions @xmath59 in what follows , we denote by @xmath60 the associated interpolation error @xmath61 .",
    "existence and uniqueness of the solution follows easily from the + schoenberg - whitney - karlin - ziegler theorem + ( [ schoenberg and whitney 1953 ] ; theorem 3 , page 529 , [ karlin and ziegler 1966 ] ; or see theorem 3.7 , page 109 , [ nrnberger 1989 ] ; or theorem 9.2 , page 162 , [ devore and lorentz 1993 ] ) . when @xmath21 , the problem reduces to complete interpolation via a cubic polynomial .",
    "the latter is of less concern since asymptotic theory for the motivating statistical problem has already been developed for this case ; see [ groeneboom , jongbloed , and wellner ( 2001a ) , ( 2001b ) ] .",
    "we therefore assume hereafter that @xmath0 .",
    "this problem seems to be new in the sense that it has not been considered by the literature on interpolation via splines in general .",
    "unlike in complete or natural interpolation , the smoothingboundary conditions of the spline interpolant @xmath56 are not being absorbed at the boundary points @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath62 ( here we refer to the conditions in ( [ complcond ] ) and ( [ derivnatur ] ) ) but instead , are re - distributed  somehow evenly among the knots .",
    "another feature of this problem is that the number of knots of the spline interpolant depends on its degree , which seems to be somewhat unusual ( personal communication with nira dyn ) . on the other hand , functions that are not twice differentiable or smoother on @xmath6 $ ]",
    "can be very well interpolated as long as they are differentiable at @xmath54 for @xmath55 . whether the interpolation error is bounded for these functions",
    "remains an open question , but it is clear that they are eliminated from the scheme of complete or natural interpolation via splines of degree @xmath63 .",
    "the consideration of this non - standard  hermite interpolation problem was originally motivated by a nonparametric estimation problem in a certain class of shape - constrained densities .",
    "in fact , it arises naturally in connection with the asymptotic distribution of the least squares ( ls ) and maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimators of a @xmath7-monotone density @xmath64 on @xmath65 ; i.e. , a density that satisfies : @xmath66 is nonincreasing and convex for @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be @xmath69 independent random variables with a common @xmath7-monotone density @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the empirical distribution of the @xmath72 s ; i.e. @xmath73}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it has been shown [ balabdaoui and wellner 2004a ] that both the ml and ls estimators , denoted hereafter by @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , are splines of degree @xmath37 with simple ( random ) knots .",
    "the number and the locations of these are uniquely determined by the minimization problem defining the estimators ( and the data via @xmath76 ) , and they can be computed via an iterative spline algorithm ( see [ balabdaoui and wellner 2004b ] ) .",
    "now , when the true @xmath7-monotone density @xmath70 is assumed to be @xmath7-times differentiable at some fixed point @xmath77 such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 is continuous in the neighborhood of @xmath80 , then the number of knots around @xmath80 increases to infinity almost surely and hence the distance between two successive knots decreases to 0 .",
    "it turns out that proving that the stochastic order of this distance is @xmath81 as @xmath82 is the main key to deriving the exact rates of convergence of @xmath83 or @xmath84 , @xmath85 , as well as the corresponding limiting distribution .",
    "here we choose to focus on @xmath75 rather than @xmath74 since it is easier through the simple characterization of @xmath75 to make the link between the new hermite problem in ( [ newherm ] ) and the nonparametric estimation problem .",
    "it has been shown [ balabdaoui and wellner 2004a ] that a necessary and sufficient condition for a @xmath7-monotone function @xmath75 to be equal to the lse is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 in other words , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the @xmath7-fold and @xmath91-fold integrals of @xmath75 and @xmath71 respectively , and their corresponding curves have to touch each other at every knot of @xmath75 .",
    "note also that @xmath89 is a spline of degree @xmath1 with the same knots as @xmath75 .",
    "now , if we assume that @xmath75 has at least @xmath53 knots @xmath92 in the neighborhood of @xmath80 , an event that occurs with probability @xmath93 as @xmath82 , then it follows from the characterization in ( [ charlse ] ) that @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "hence , @xmath96 on @xmath97 $ ] , an identity that plays a major role in studying the distance between consecutive knots . through this identity , the least square esimator , which in essence estimates the whole density , could be studied locally in the neighborhood of the point of interest @xmath80 . to be able to obtain the stochastic order of the distance between the knots of the estimator , arguments from empirical processes theory ( [ van der vaart and wellner 1996 ] )",
    "are used in combination with the current conjecture on the interpolation error . for more technical details",
    ", we refer to [ balabdaoui and wellner 2004d , page 12 , lemma 2.3 ] .",
    "another version of this same problem arises in showing the existence of a solution to the natural gaussian version of the problem [ see balabdaoui and wellner 2004c ] .      proving that the distance between successive knots is indeed of the stochastic order @xmath81 as @xmath82 still depends on bounding @xmath98 independently of the locations of the knots , for any function @xmath91-differentiable function @xmath11 such that @xmath99 admits a finite total variation . for more details ,",
    "see [ balabdaoui and wellner 2004d , page 16 , lemma 2.4 ] .",
    "we formulate our conjecture as follows :    let @xmath52 and @xmath100 . if @xmath101 , then there exists @xmath102 such that @xmath103    if the bound in ( [ conjec ] ) is true , then we can establish the following lemma :    if ( 8) holds , then for any function @xmath11 in @xmath104 , j=0 , \\cdots , k$ ] , we have @xmath105    * proof .",
    "* using taylor expansion we can write for all @xmath106 @xmath107 since @xmath108 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath1 for @xmath109 , it follows that @xmath110f^{(k+j)}(u ) du,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on @xmath6 $ ] , and hence , if @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 by the conjecture .",
    "now , for @xmath113 , we can apply again taylor expansion to the function @xmath114 ( @xmath115 fixed ) to obtain @xmath116 this implies that @xmath117(v - u)^{j-1}_{+ } dv \\bigg \\vert_\\infty \\\\ & \\leq & ( k+j-1)\\cdots j \\ c_k",

    "* to conform more closely with the error bound given in the natural and complete interpolation problem , we note that the bound in ( [ implic . ] ) can be replaced by @xmath120 , where @xmath26 denotes again the largest distance between two successive knots , and @xmath121 , which follows from iterative application of the @xmath122-inequality .",
    "in the absence of a theoretical proof of ( 8) , a natural approach is to replicate the interpolation problem a number of times .",
    "the knots of the spline interpolant as well as the single knot , @xmath115 , of the hinge function @xmath123 ( the function being interpolated ) are drawn independently from a uniform distribution on @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the procedure can be simply described as follows :    1 .",
    "generate @xmath124 independent uniform random variables on @xmath125 , + @xmath126 .",
    "2 .   set @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where + @xmath129 are the order statistics of @xmath130 .",

    "the monte carlo procedure described above can be run using the second program which produces a statistical summary as well as plots of the empirical distribution of the interpolation error .",
    "choosing a large number of digits of the random numbers , @xmath133 , seems to resolve some of the numerical issues that we have encountered : when some of the knots are extremely close to each other , the linear system becomes very close to being singular in which case mathematica suppresses the corresponding outcome .",
    "this suppression due to severe ill - conditioning of the matrices does not happen if @xmath133 is taken to be appropriately large .",
    "however , we believe that other numerical instabilities do occur and become increasingly severe as we increase the value of @xmath7 . for @xmath3 , we performed @xmath134 monte carlo replications .",

    ", one is interested in the maximal interpolation error over all configurations , but it is also of some interest to get an idea about its distribution . in these simulations and further ones ,",
    "the obtained maximal error over all knot configurations seems to be stable and reasonably small for @xmath135 .",
    "however , the order of this maximal error seems to increase with @xmath7 to reach extremely large values ( @xmath136 for @xmath137 ) .",
    "note that the values of the median and the 95%-quantile decay steadily . in the absence of theoretical argument that proves or disproves the conjecture",
    ", large maximal errors would cast doubt on the validity of the conjecture for large @xmath7 .",
    "however , we have an evidence of numerical instabilities that will be presented and discussed in the next subsection . there",
    ", the interpolated function is much smoother than the hinge function since it is assumed to be @xmath5-times continuously differentiable , nevertheless extremely large interpolation errors do also occur .",
    "these large maximal errors can be compared with much smaller bounds that could be obtained via the perfect splines theory .",

    "as mentioned in section 2 , our hermite interpolation arises naturally in the study of the stochastic behavior of the least squares and maximum likelihood estimators of a @xmath7-monotone density .",
    "considering interpolation of the hinge functions @xmath142 might appear somewhat too ambitious as boundedness of the error independently of the locations of the knots in this problem is only a sufficient condition for the result to hold for smoother classes of functions . but as a matter of fact , hinge functions constitute a basis of the @xmath91-fold integral of empirical distribution functions which are involved in the original estimation problem and play a major a role in understanding the asymptotic properties of the estimators ( for more technical details see [ balabdaoui and wellner 2004d , page 16 , lemma 2.4 ] ) . our numerical investigations point partially to the validity of the conjecture for small values of @xmath7 but leave us with more unanswered questions for larger values .     with @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( solid line ) and its hermite spline interpolant ( dashed line ) .",

    ", it follows from the maximal error for interpolating the perfect spline that there exists some constant @xmath39 very close to 2 such that @xmath147 the importance of the latter result is two - fold : beside that it gives a uniform upper bound on the monospline ( it turns out that this bound can be greatly improved for small values of @xmath7 , see table [ monospline ] ) , it serves as a way of checking the numerical stability of the solution given by interpolating directly  @xmath148 .",
    "the extremely large values obtained for the @xmath149 for @xmath150 are believed to be due to severe ill - conditioning of the problem as some of the knots are very close to each other ( see table [ knotconfig ] ) .",
    "this might explain also the large errors obtained for interpolating the hinge functions @xmath142 for large values if @xmath7 .     with @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( solid line ) and its hermite spline interpolant ( dashed line ) .",

    "the outcomes of many simulations that were performed with the two different bases and taking for every replication the same random knots were very comparable . on the other hand , we have done more comparisons between our hermite interpolant and the complete one to get a better understanding about their relative goodness of approximation",
    ". one might think that our spline interpolant problem should behave better than the complete spline in the case where the number of ( interior ) knots @xmath161 : the reasoning would be based on the fact that our spline interpolant matches not only the function to be approximated at the knots ( including the boundary points ) but it also matches its tangent , and hence tries to `` adapt '' more to its shape . in all the examples that we have taken including @xmath162 disprove this idea .",
    "but the question remains open : are there functions that are better approximated ( in the @xmath138 sense ) by our hermite spline than by the complete spline@xmath163 this question prompts another one in a different direction : we know that the perfect spline gives in our problem the largest interpolation error over the class @xmath4 $ ] and even over sobolev space @xmath164 , but what kind of functions give the worst interpolation error in the sobolev space @xmath165 in the complete interpolation problem , [ shadrin 2001 ] makes use of the properties of the null spline to bound the orthogonal projector of @xmath166 $ ] equipped with the @xmath138-norm on the space of splines of degree @xmath37 . the argument in our problem might need to involve such constructions as well .",
    "finally , it seems natural to wonder whether , for a given sufficiently smooth function @xmath11 , the spline @xmath56 is the solution of some minimization problem : we wonder whether the @xmath8-norm ( or in general the @xmath10-norm , @xmath167 ) of @xmath168 ( or in general of @xmath169 for some @xmath170 ) minimizes some functional , yet to be defined .",
    "the problem seems to be hard to solve , and it is not clear yet in which direction one should try to find such a criterion , although the interpolation problem was first originated by a least squares problem . + our aim in this paper is to call attention to this new interpolation problem , which plays the role of a bridge between deterministic spline theory and statistical estimation for @xmath171monotone functions .",
