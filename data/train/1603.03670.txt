    "discovery of broad lines and strong non - stellar continuum in polarized light of seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite and thermal infrared ( ir ) excesses @xcite led to idea about existence in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) of dusty , molecular tori @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to unify seyfert  2 galaxies ( only narrow lines and weak or absent non - stellar continuum ) with seyfert  1 galaxies ( broad emission lines and strong non - stellar continuum ) .",
    "the dusty tori were proposed also to unify narrow - line radio galaxies with radio - loud ( rl ) quasars and broad - line radio galaxies @xcite , and discovery of radio - quiet ( rq ) quasars of type  2 ( @xcite and refs . therein ) confirmed the presence of dusty obscurers in rq quasars as well .",
    "as indicated by the number ratio of the type  2 agn to the type  1 agn , and , independently , by the infrared - to - uv luminosity ratio , these tori are geometrically thick . they are predicted to have inner edge at the sublimation radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and are likely enclosed within the black hole ( bh ) influence sphere ( @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "location of the inner edge at the sublimation radius is confirmed by reverberation mappings ( e.g. @xcite ) and by near - ir interferometry @xcite , while constraints on their spatial extensions are suggested by the mid - ir interferometry .",
    "hence , studies of such tori provide excellent opportunity to probe the conditions of the outermost portions of the bh accretion flows .",
    "unfortunately , physical and dynamical structure of dusty tori is still not known ( see review by ) .",
    "it is even uncertain , whether they are really tori , or maybe the tori are just mimicked by optically thick portions of disc winds ( e.g. @xcite ) or by warped , tilted accretion discs ( @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "one might try to resolve the real structure of the dusty region by modelling spectra of ir radiation resulting from reprocessing of optical / uv central radiation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the complexity of these models , the observed spectra can be reproduced by many of them with a broad choice of the adopted model parameters @xcite .",
    "regardless of the uncertainties in the ` torus ' structure , using the mid - ir spectra one can at least study the fraction of the central radiation that is reprocessed by circumnuclear dust ( @xmath0 ) , in particular its distribution and dependence on the eddington ratio ( @xmath1 ) and black hole mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "noting that luminous rq and rl quasars cover similar ranges of these parameters , by comparing above properties in these two quasar populations one may try to verify whether the conditions in their outer accretion discs are different , as one might expect in case of having accretion triggered by mergers in rl quasars and by secular processes in rq quasars @xcite , and/or having accretion flows characterized by higher magnetization in the rl quasars as compared with the rq ones . obviously , if existing , the largest difference in the @xmath3 should be noticed between the rq quasars and the most rl ones . hence , unlike in similar studies performed by @xcite , our rl quasar sample was chosen to be represented only by quasars with fanaroff - riley class ii ( fr ii ) radio - morphology",
    "furthermore , in order to exclude possible differentiating effects coming from different bh masses , eddington - ratios , and redshifts , we perform such comparison by respective pairings of rl and rq quasars . first , when deriving dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , we pair each rl quasar with a rq one with the same redshift and black hole masses . secondly ,",
    "when studying dependence of @xmath3 on the black hole mass , we pair quasars with the same redshift and @xmath4 .",
    "thirdly , when studying dependence of @xmath3 on the redshift , we pair quasars with the same @xmath4 and black hole mass .    our work is organized as follows : in  [ sec_samples ] we define our data samples , in  [ sec_methods ] the methods of calculation of @xmath3 and pairing procedures are described , in  [ sec_results ] results of our studies of covering factors of dusty obscurers in fr  ii versus rq quasars are presented , and in  [ sec_discussion ] they are discussed in the context of the radio diversity of quasars .",
    "we adopted @xmath5 cold dark matter cosmology , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a large catalogue of 59192 fr  ii radio sources @xcite was recently compiled by @xcite , using data from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimetres ( first ) catalogue @xcite . from this , @xcite selected a sample of 1108 fr  ii quasars by matching their fr  ii radio sources with the combined dr7 and dr9 catalogues of sdss quasars .",
    "we are interested only in the dr7 quasars , for which black hole mass estimates are available @xcite . since sources that are both in the dr7 and dr9 are denoted as ` dr9 ' , in order to select all dr7 quasars , we performed additional matching of the fr  ii quasar sample of @xcite ( 1108 sources ) with the sdss dr7 quasar catalogue @xcite ( 105783 sources ) .",
    "we used a matching radius of 5 arcsec and obtained 899 objects .",
    "this resulting sample of fr ii quasars was then matched with the sample of sdss dr7 quasars detected by the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) _",
    "this gave us 895 fr ii quasars detected in the mir band .",
    "the rq sample with mir data is constructed by matching the dr7 quasar catalogue @xcite and _ wise _ all - sky catalogue @xcite , using a matching radius of 1 arcsec , resulting in 101853 objects . from these",
    "we remove the 899 rl quasars matched with the catalog by @xcite , this leaves us with 100958 quasars .",
    "we then remove objects that were detected by the first survey @xcite , this gives us 92648 .",
    "we repeat the same process with the nvss @xcite and end up with 92445 objects .",
    "we also removed those objects that were outside the first observation region .",
    "as it is stated in  3 , we calculate the mid infrared luminosity , using the flux measured in the _",
    "wise_/w3 window ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in order to avoid having this window too close to the short - wavelength edge of the mir band in the quasar rest frame , we limit our samples to @xmath10 .",
    "we also introduce a limit on black hole masses , taking only quasars with @xmath11 .",
    "this is in order to avoid seyfert galaxies , in which the mir flux can have a significant contribution from starbursts .",
    "furthermore , putting limits on redshift and black hole mass reduces biases imposed on studied properties by selection effects related to the flux limits .",
    "finally , we constrain our samples to the objects with the eddington - ratio @xmath12 to assure that accretion flows in the selected objects are radiatively efficient . after applying all these limits we end - up with 797 fr  ii quasars and 67480 rq quasars .    in figure [ img_hist ]",
    "we show the histograms of our rl and rq samples as a function of redshift @xmath13 , black hole mass @xmath14 , and eddington radio @xmath4 .",
    ", black hole mass @xmath15 , and eddington radio @xmath16 . ]",
    "there are two main methods to derive covering factors of dusty , circumnuclear obscurers , using number ratio of type 1 to type 2 agns or using ratio of the mir luminosity to the bolometric luminosity ( see review by ) .",
    "both methods suffer from several drawbacks , the former because of difficulties to assure the common parent agn population and because of having dependence of @xmath17 on the covering factor distributions @xcite , the latter because derivation of the covering factor from @xmath18 requires knowledge of anisotropy of accretion disc and obscurer radiation , and those are model dependent . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the covering factor is simply equal to @xmath0 , which corresponds with the assumption of isotropic radiation of both components . while quantitatively this may lead to large systematic departures from real values of covering factors ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , as long as our main interest is to verify whether dusty obscurers in rl and rq quasars are different , using @xmath3 is not expected to affect trends studied by us .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 taking @xmath19 from @xcite and @xmath20 using formula @xmath21 , where @xmath22hz , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 magnitudes are provided by @xcite , denoted in table  [ tbl_1 ] as ` w3 ' ."
