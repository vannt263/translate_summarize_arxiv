    "the coexistence of itinerant superconducting phase and localized antiferromagnetic phase in k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2 @xcite sheds light on the intervening coupling between the electron correlation effect and the lattice effect .",
    "when the fe 3@xmath5 electrons are localized and form the antiferromagnetic insulating state with high - spin fe@xmath8 , the insulating phase tends to expand due to fe - fe bond length increase and applies a kind of pressure to the remaining metallic region .",
    "@xcite the antiferromagnetic insulating phase in k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2 is identified as k@xmath2fe@xmath9se@xmath10 with fe vacancy order .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the superconducting phase is likely to be fese which is under the pressure from the expanded and insulating k@xmath2fe@xmath9se@xmath10 . in the insulating k@xmath2fe@xmath9se@xmath10 phase , the four fe sites with square geometry form a ferromagnetic block which couples antiferromagnetically with neighboring blocks .",
    "@xcite the transfer integrals between the neighboring blocks are reduced due to the fe vacancy , and the mott insulating state is realized . in the xps study on k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2 , two components of the fe 2@xmath11 peak are assigned to the coexisting superconducting and insulating phases in the superconducting k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2 while , in insulating k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2 , the fe 2@xmath11 peak consists of a single component .",
    "@xcite the charge - transfer energy from se 4@xmath4 to fe 3@xmath5 is estimated to be 2.3 ev which is smaller than the repulsive coulomb interaction between the fe 3@xmath5 electrons of 3.5 ev .",
    "@xcite therefore , the insulating k@xmath2fe@xmath9se@xmath10 phase with high - spin fe@xmath8 can be regarded as a mott insulating state of charge - transfer type instead of mott - hubbard - type , and the se 4@xmath4 orbitals should be taken into account to explain the magnetic interactions between the fe spins .    recently ,",
    "another insulating fe selenide bafe@xmath2se@xmath3 has been attracting much attention due to the specific quasi one - dimensional crystal structure with pnma space group as well as the block - type antiferromagnetic state similar to k@xmath2fe@xmath9se@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in addition , bafe@xmath2se@xmath3 is predicted to be a new type of multiferroic system with magnetic and ferrielectric orders in a recent theoretical work , @xcite which certainly enhances the interest in the title system . in bafe@xmath2se@xmath3 ,",

    "interestingly , resistivity also depends on the growth condition .",
    "_ reported that resistivity exhibits activation - type temperature dependence with band gap of 0.18 ev .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , one - dimensional variable range hopping was reported by nambu _",
    "_ indicating that some carriers are localized due to strong scattering effect in the quasi one - dimensional structure .",
    "@xcite in addition , coexistence of itinerant and localized electrons was recently indicated by the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering study by monney _",
    "et al_. @xcite this observation suggests that the itinerant electrons introduced by small fe vacancy or some other effects would be responsible for the reduction of the magnetic moment and the variable range hopping behavior of the resistivity .",
    "@xcite in contrast to bafe@xmath2se@xmath3 , csfe@xmath2se@xmath3 with formal fe valence of + 2.5 is much more insulating .",

    "the situation of the two - leg ladder fe chalcogenides is opposite to this expectation , and csfe@xmath2se@xmath3 with formal fe valence of + 2.5 is more insulating than integer valence bafe@xmath2se@xmath3 and bafe@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
