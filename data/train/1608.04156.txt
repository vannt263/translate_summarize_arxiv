    "the laplace transform ( lt ) method has been widely used to solve problems in several areas of science and engineering . after proper transformation of the space variable , the application of lt to dynamic models is useful for finding semi - analytic solutions for many real dynamic problems in the so - called _ laplace domain _ @xcite .",
    "those solutions need to be inverted in order to obtain appropriate solutions in the time domain ; if analytical inversion is not possible , then numerical procedures such as the stehfest @xcite or de hoog @xcite algorithms are employed .",
    "sometimes , just the short- or long - term system behavior is of interest , and for this purpose asymptotic approaches are commonly used to avoid the inversion needed for complete solutions @xcite . for solute transport and fluid flow problems in porous media , such as aquifers @xcite , oil , and geothermal reservoirs , the lt method helps to find semi - analytic solutions @xcite , exhibiting many advantages over purely numerical procedures .",
    "the main example is where subsequent inverse modeling will be implemented in order to retrieve model parameters of interest .",
    "however , for more complex problems , the semi - analytic solution is often not easy to obtain or does not exist , and other alternatives need to be explored . in this context",
    ", numerical solutions are commonly used ; but if they are not properly handled , some restrictions related to the spatial discretization process appear .",
    "specifically , these frequently include numerical dispersion , instabilities due to the discretization procedure , and violations of the mass conservation principle .",
    "recently , hybrid methods combining lt and finite differences ( ltfd ) have successfully been applied to solve problems of slightly compressible fluid flow in oil reservoirs @xcite two - phase fluid flow problems @xcite , and even for the solution of advection - dispersion - type models in the economy @xcite or in heat conduction problems@xcite .",
    "this sort of hybrid method presents some valuable characteristics which are absent in numerical solutions : i ) there are no restrictions on the time variable as it is approximated in the laplace domain , so the solution can be generated for any specific value , and ii ) the initial conditions and other time - dependent properties are easily treated in the laplace domain .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the ltfd method has some disadvantages compared to the purely - numerical approach : i ) as time approaches zero , the laplace parameter tends to diverge and oscillating solutions could appear , and ii ) the ltfd method is not robust when solutions behave in a non - smooth way @xcite . as the aim of this work is to present the model solution for non - fickian and fractal double - porosity / single - permeability reservoirs , and to analyze the ltfd methodology as a potential tool for modeling fluid reservoirs , we put special attention on the details described above .    in this work , through the combination of the laplace transform and finite difference methods , we developed and validated semi - numerical solutions for fractal telegraphic double - porosity models previously derived in @xcite . in the cited work , only solutions for particular cases were reported ; they were used to validate our model solutions .",
    "we solved the complete model , whose solution , to the best of our knowledge , has not been reported before in the literature .",
    "further , a parametric analysis of physical parameters was carried out .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the mathematical model along with initial and boundary conditions . sec .",

    "as in the pioneering work of warren and root @xcite , the physical model consists of a porous medium constituted by two media : one where fluid flows and the other where fluid is stored .",
    "the former is associated with the connected fracture network and the latter to the rock matrix .",
    "one of the main differences between the warren and root model and the one solved in this paper is that here the porous medium is assumed to be a percolating cluster , where backbone structure plays the role of the fracture network and dead - ends play the role of the rock matrix .",
    "fluid motion occurs in the backbone network whereas dead - end structures can participate or not in the flow , depending on physical parameters .",
    "thus , the dimensionless mathematical model describing the fluid behavior in isotropic fractal reservoirs due to participation of the fracture network and rock matrix is given by @xcite    @xmath0r^{d_{de}-d_{bb}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial h_{1}}{\\partial t}\\label{e2},\\\\   \\quad \\textrm{where}\\quad \\beta = d_{bb}-1-\\theta \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the last equation , @xmath1 is the dimensionless dead - ends hydraulic head and @xmath2 is the dimensionless hydraulic head inside the percolation backbone . the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fractal dimensions of the backbone network and dead - end structure , respectively , @xmath5 is the euclidean dimension in which the system is embedded , @xmath6 is the backbone storativity ratio , and @xmath7 is the relaxation time associated with fluid flow within the backbone fracture network .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 quantifies the fluid exchanged between the percolation backbone and the dead - end structure while @xmath9 is related to the connectivity degree of the backbone network .",
    "more details of the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) represents the hydraulic head evolution inside the dead - ends , including mass exchange between dead - end and fracture networks . meanwhile , eq . ( [ e2 ] )",
    "is related to head evolution inside the backbone due to gradient - driven flux and dead - end contributions .",
    "note from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) that fluid accumulation inside dead - ends depends only on the fluid gradient between the backbone and the dead - ends .",
    "furthermore , the amount of fluid passing from the dead - ends to the backbone is determined by the exchange parameter @xmath8 and position within the porous medium . in this sense , the discharge point is not connected to dead - ends , but rather is only connected to the backbone structure . on",
    "the other hand , fluid inside backbones flows through porous media at a finite velocity , and its motion depends on the flux - driven term and the mass exchange with the dead - ends , as described in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) .      as the model is of second - order in time and space for the backbone equation and of first - order in time for the dead - end equation , we need two initial conditions and two boundary conditions for eq .",

    ", we have : @xmath10    @xmath11    the boundary conditions depend on the operating conditions being modeled . in this work ,",
    "we define two cases : i ) a bounded reservoir with constant head at the wellbore and ii ) a bounded reservoir with asymptotically constant flow rate at the wellbore . for the first case , we set constant head at the inner boundary as follows :    @xmath12    which is a dirichlet - type condition , and for the outer boundary we impose zero flux ( a neumann - type boundary condition ) , i.e. , @xmath13 the instantaneous flow rate is evaluated considering the memory of the flow caused by the non - locality in time as follows : @xmath14 note that , to evaluate the amount of fluid discharged at any time , it is necessary to integrate the solution from the beginning . eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) comes from the derivation of the generalized darcy s law , which is not restricted to only the instantaneous response of flow to head gradients .",
    "in fact , the exponential function inside the integral operator represents an appropriated kernel encompassing ballistic diffusion for short times and normal diffusion for long times @xcite . these features are useful for modeling flow processes in highly heterogeneous porous media @xcite .    for the second case",
    ", it is not possible to define a constant flow rate at the wellbore because of the non - locality induced by fractality and memory processes , so an asymptotic function is proposed which becomes constant as time increases .",
    "this is given by @xmath15 as a matter of fact , this condition is more realistic in practice than the one commonly used in drawdown well test analysis , which states a constant flow rate .    by selecting eq .",

    "[ fig:3 ] . in our investigation , we varied the fractal parameters in order to explore their effects on flow performance and pay special attention to the physical meaning .",
    "possible interconnections of fractal parameters were left aside as the main aim of this work is to present semi - numerical solutions .",
    "a deeper investigation of the dynamics of fractal non - fickian reservoirs will be carried out in future , where physical connections between fractal parameters and rock fabric will be determined .",
    "specially , the ltfd method will be applied to characterize aquifers , geothermal , and oil reservoirs constituted of fractured rock .",
    "results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] exhibit characteristic regimes of dual - porosity models : short- , middle- , and long - term behaviors . as demonstrated above , for short times , small oscillations",
    "are observed in figs .",
    "[ fig:3]a , b , e , and f , especially when the backbone fractal dimension and the permeability exponent differ from the euclidean values , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively . as a matter of fact , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath9 have dominant effects over the head and flow in comparison with the dead - end fractal dimension @xmath4 .",
    "an increase of @xmath166 has the same effect as an equivalent decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "this can be inferred from comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig:3]@xmath167 and [ fig:3]@xmath59 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "results plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:3]@xmath167 and @xmath59 correspond to the flow regime lying between linear and radial dimensions ( see the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and for moderate backbone - dead - end interactions ( see the values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) . at this point",
    ", it is worth recalling that @xmath9 quantifies effective connections in the backbone fracture network , where larger values indicate poor connectivity leading to smaller flow rate , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]@xmath167 .",
    "this effect is also verified for substantial increments of the dimensionless head in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]@xmath59 , suggesting that it decreases significantly .",
    "meanwhile , results plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:3]@xmath170 and @xmath5 indicate that fluid production is enhanced from the onset of homogeneous behavior , @xmath155 , when @xmath4 increases .",
    "this effect is more noticeable in the case of the backbone fractal dimension .",
    "this phenomenon is explained , in part , by the fact that , in our simulations , there is little fluid exchanged between the backbone and dead - end networks ; therefore , the main contribution to the flow rate comes from the backbone network . summarizing , it is concluded that the closer the fractal dimension of dead - end and backbone structures are to the euclidean dimension , the better the rate improvement obtained , while the opposite holds when the connectivity index , @xmath9 , approaches unity .",
    "in this paper , we have implemented a semi - numerical method to solve a fractal telegraphic dual - porosity fluid flow model whose coupled solution is not feasible to obtain semi - analytically .",
    "the transient part was handled using the laplace transform technique , while spatial derivatives were discretized using central finite differences .",
    "thus , step time constrictions are avoided as no discretization is required , and the space discretization fulfills the mass conservation without compromising numerical stability . as inversion from the laplace domain to dimensionless time is not possible analytically , the stehfest algorithm was used to compute the time evolution of flow rate and hydraulic head .",
    "our approach was validated for analytically solvable cases , and good agreement was observed .",
    "it was found that larger values of fractal dimensions of dead - end and backbone networks improve the flow rate while the connectivity index diminishes the flow rate as it approaches unity .",
    "the capability of the methodology presented here encourages its application to characterizing fractured water , geothermal , and petroleum reservoirs .",
