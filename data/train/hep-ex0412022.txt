    "a lepton flavor violating decay such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 could conceivably proceed through a box diagram involving an exchange of a neutrino along with a suitable mixing matrix . in the standard model , neutrinos",
    "are usually taken to be massless , and this decay route is thus excluded .",
    "one expects that with neutrino masses in the ev range , this decay would be heavily suppressed and should not visible at any current facilities .",
    "thus observation of this decay mode would constitute important evidence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the previous best limits  @xcite on the branching fractions are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the data used in this analysis were produced at the cesr @xmath6 collider at the @xmath7 resonance using the cleo2 detector  @xcite .",
    "the dataset comprises some @xmath8 decays , and also includes some @xmath9 of data taken some @xmath10 below the resonance to gauge the size of non b backgrounds , including continuum @xmath11 production , and 2 photon fusion events .",
    "the continuum ( and tau ) event samples below resonance can be scaled according to the ratio of accepted luminosity to beam energy squared , @xmath12 , to extrapolate the behavior of these components at the @xmath13 .",
    "the scale factor is 1.99 for this data .",
    "backgrounds from 2 photon events are minimized by doing a cut on the missing momentum in the event .",
    "the final state events we look for involve @xmath14 or its charge conjugate recoiling against a generic @xmath15 or @xmath16 decay .",
    "the @xmath17 is identified by its leptonic decays to @xmath18 and @xmath19 states . as a shorthand for this presentation , we refer to the decay chain @xmath20 as @xmath21 . in the b rest frame , the primary lepton , @xmath22 , is monoenergetic . in the lab frame ,",
    "the @xmath23 is slightly boosted , and thus the primary lepton has a momentum between 2.2 and 2.5 gev , easily within the electron and muon particle identification abilities of the cleo detector .",
    "the secondary lepton has a range of momenta and is required to have momentum greater than 0.6 ( 1.0 ) gev for electron ( muon ) identification . in this",
    "study the missing energy - momentum four vector , determined by reference to the known beam energy , is referred to as @xmath24 .",
    "two neural networks are used to exclude backgrounds from continuum and @xmath0 events . for continuum",
    "suppresion , the neural net @xmath25 uses as inputs r2 ( the ratio of the 2nd to 0th fox wolfram moments ) , the event sphericity , the event thrust , the cosine of the angle between the momentum difference of the leptons and the thrust axis of the rest of the event , and the cosine of the angle between the ( unobserved ) neutrino pair and lepton pair .",
    "this network is trained using samples of signal and generic continuum monte carlo .",
    "the network used to suppress events from @xmath0 events , @xmath26 , uses three inputs .",
    "these are the beam energy constrained b candidate mass , the difference between the candidate b energy and the beam energy , and the cosine of the angle between the primary lepton and the momentum of the other @xmath23 in the event .",
    "this network is trained with signal and @xmath0 generic monte carlo samples . for each of the four possible @xmath21 modes",
    ", events are rejected by cuts in the @xmath25 vs @xmath26 plane .        as a cross check of the analysis method",
    ", we compare the data and monte carlo agreement in the side bands of the primary lepton - this sample requires that the primary lepton momentum be either in the ( 2.0,2.2 ) gev window or the ( 2.5,2.7 ) gev window . fig  [ fig : fig1 ] is a plot of the off resonance subtracted data and generic b monte carlo for events in this primary lepton sideband for the @xmath27 sample .",
    "the plots show the output of the continuum neural net , the @xmath0 neural net , the difference between the measured and true @xmath17 mass using @xmath24 , and the beam energy constrained @xmath17 mass difference , in which the missing neutrino pair energy is taken to be the difference between the beam energy and the sum of the lepton energies .",
    "another check compares primary lepton sideband data for the off resonance data events to the events in the absolutely normalized continuum generic monte carlo .",
    "fig  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the same quantities as above for these samples in the @xmath27 sample .",
    "the agreement is good .",
    "it is found however that in the @xmath28 mode , the data exceeds the continuum monte carlo expectation , due to the presence of unmodelled 2 photon fusion events .",
    "we thus scale the monte carlo in the signal region by this ratio .",
    "the contribution to the final error is small since we will end up doing a subtraction of the scaled off resonance data from the on resonance data .      to obtain the final answer",
    ", we subtract the off resonance data from the on resonance data after scaling for center of mass energy evolution with @xmath29 .",
    "this is then compared to the expected contribution from @xmath0 and continuum , which is reckoned by looking at the primary lepton sidebands in both data and monte carlo .",
    "any excess would be signal .",
    "the results from individual channels are in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "the table shows no substantial deviation from expectations .",
    "upper limits derived from the raw data and monte carlo efficiencies are also shown in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "these limits include variations on all signal and background efficiencies , and conservatively scale the monte carlo in the least favorable direction by 1 @xmath30 .",
    "the largest single systematic uncertainty is in the estimation of the missing four momentum of the two neutrinos ( @xmath31 ) , resulting in total systematic uncertainties of @xmath32 in @xmath27 and @xmath33 modes and @xmath34 in @xmath28 and @xmath35 modes .",
    "these results assume that the @xmath17 from these decays are unpolarized . in the limit of a pure @xmath38 ( @xmath39 )",
    "interaction the efficiency increases ( decreases ) by @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "these are the most stringent limits to date on these processes , surpassing the previous cleo results  @xcite by a factor of 22(5 ) for the @xmath42(@xmath43 ) primary lepton mode .",
