    "ips are , however , making up a significant fraction of the galactic sources detected at higher energies , e.g. , in the _ integral_/ibis and _ swift_/bat surveys ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , and these surveys have significantly increased the known ip sample ( e.g.  @xcite ) . although the ibis and bat instruments observe in similar energy bands , the _",

    "although this is similar to the value presented here , it should be noted that the sample it was based on ( besides not being flux - limited ) included the dwarf nova ss cyg , the asynchronous polar v1432 aql , the polar igr j14536 - 5522 @xcite , and v709 cas at a distance that has since been shown to be too small @xcite .",

    "the long - period ip at @xmath64 , do dra , is a peculiar system in which the m - type secondary is readily visible @xcite , implying a relatively low accretion rate .",
    "a @xmath65 white dwarf accreting at @xmath66 has a total accretion luminosity of @xmath67 . considering the 14195  kev to bolometric conversion factor , as well as the fraction of hard x - rays emitted downward and reprocessed into soft x - rays ( roughly half ) , an accretion rate of this order",
    "is necessary to explain the high - luminosity ips ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "a single - temperature bremsstrahlung fit to the bat 70-month survey data of ex hya , v1025 cen , and do dra results in a temperature of 10.6 , 15.1 , and 15.2  kev , respectively .",
    "the only ips in our core sample of 15 with similarly low temperatures are ao psc ( 12.6  kev ) and fo aqr ( 15.2  kev ) .",
    "the low temperatures imply that swift / bat only detects a small fraction of the total hard x - ray luminosity of these ips .",
    "nevertheless , a 14195 kev luminosity of @xmath69 is incompatible with an accretion rate of @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , detailed x - ray spectroscopy of ht cam ( likely a low - luminosity system ; @xcite ) shows that it is much less absorbed than typical ips , which may explain why several low - luminosity ips were detected by _",
    "rosat _ but not by bat .",
    "we showed that a population of ips at @xmath5 in the 14195  kev band can have a space density as high as @xmath6 ( section  [ sec : limits ] ) . in that case , we expect ( using the cumulative distribution function shown in figure 10 of @xcite ) that the _ swift_/bat 70-month survey should contain @xmath70 of these systems , compared to the 3 that are known at present .",
    "we can also find a ( weak ) lower limit on the space density of such low - luminosity ips , by noting that all 3 detected systems are within 200  pc [ ex hya and do dra have distances of @xmath71  pc and @xmath72  pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and for v1025 cen , we find a firm lower distance limit of 70  pc , and an estimate of roughly 110  pc ] .",
    "the effective volume of the galaxy at @xmath73  pc , conservatively assuming a larger scale - height of 260  pc , is @xmath74 .",
    "the low - luminosity ips then have a space density of @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , a low - luminosity ip population , likely at least as large as the the more frequently detected higher luminosity population , and possibly up to @xmath58 larger , exists .",
    "almost all known ips are found above the period gap ( see e.g.  figure  1 of @xcite ) , where systems should spend only a short fraction of their lives , while most polars are short - period systems .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that ips evolve into polars below the period gap ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in @xcite , we showed that the space densities of long - period ips and short - period polars are consistent with the quite simplistic model where all ips become synchronized below the period gap , accounting for the entire short - period polar population .",
    "however , if the low - luminosity ip population is dominated by short - period systems ( as appears to be the case ) , short - period ips might be as intrinsically common as short - period polars ( the space density of short - period polars is @xmath76 , if the high - state duty cycle is 0.5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "then another viable explanation for the fate of long - period ips would be that they evolve into short - period ips ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .    at the flux limit used to define our complete sample ( @xmath77 ) , _",

    "the all sky survey with _ erosita _ , which is expected to reach an average sensitivity of @xmath82 in the 210  kev band @xcite , will therefore be important in the study of low - luminosity ips in particular .",

    "although many sources in the _ swift_/bat 70-month survey are still unidentified at longer wavelengths , it is possible to construct a complete , and still usefully large , ip sample from these data . we have obtained a complete flux - limited sample of 15 ips , all above the period gap , by imposing the selection cuts @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "this estimate is in good agreement with our previous measurement of @xmath86 for long - period ips , from an independent data set @xcite .",
    "we have also used the data to constrain the size of a fainter ip population that could exist without being included in our sample .",
    "a single-@xmath9 population of ips with 14195  kev luminosity below @xmath87 must have a mid - plane space density less than @xmath88 .",
    "4 .   considering all ips detected in the _",

    "the space density of the low - luminosity population is at least @xmath91 ( i.e.  similar to the space density of the @xmath92 population to which our @xmath2 measurement applies ) and possibly as high as @xmath6 ( or @xmath58 the space density of the bright population ) .",
