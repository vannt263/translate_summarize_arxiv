    "if @xmath3 is the dynkin diagram of a symmetrizable kac - moody algebra , then we can construct a series of diagrams @xmath4 by attaching an @xmath5 `` tail '' to a fixed vertex . for large @xmath6",
    ", one can consider weights supported on the `` head '' ( @xmath0 and the adjacent portion of the tail ) and on the end of the tail , and vanishing on a large section of tail in between .",
    "we can extend such a weight to @xmath4 for all larger values of @xmath6 by simply allowing this gap to grow .",
    "we might hope that there would be some interesting asymptotic behavior as @xmath6 goes to infinity .    in the case",
    "where @xmath7 , this construction was first studied by hanlon in @xcite , and r. brylinski in @xcite .",
    "they discovered a number of interesting stabilization phenomena , most of which seem specific to the @xmath5 case .",
    "however , in @xcite , kleber and viswanath show that one aspect does carry over :    [ kv - theorem]_(kleber , viswanath ) _ let @xmath8 be a deep triple of weights ( as defined in section [ sec : deep - weights ] ) on @xmath4 supported on the head and end of tail as described above .",
    "then the tensor product multiplicity @xmath9 for the kac - moody algebra @xmath10 stabilizes for @xmath6 sufficiently large .    the proof is based on an analysis of the crystal graph of a representation of @xmath11 via littlemann paths and the following easy consequence of the theory of crystal graphs due to kashiwara and others ( see , for example , @xcite )    [ crystal - tens ] let @xmath12 be the crystal ( graph ) corresponding to the representation @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16th kashiwara operator .",
    "our aim in this paper is to generalize theorem  [ kv - theorem ] by using a variant of kleber and viswanath s techniques .",
    "we will replace littelmann paths with the crystal structure on the components of quiver varieties , described in @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to extend theorem  [ kv - theorem ] to a more general class of arrangements .",
    "our results imply the stabilization theorems of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.6 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) , though some care is required to see this in the case of @xcite : the restriction of `` extensibility '' there exactly implies that tensor product multiplicities vanish in the non - deep case .",
    "kleber and viswanath refer to this as the `` number - of - boxes condition '' by analogy with @xmath17 , where it implies that the number of boxes in the young diagram adds under tensor product .",
    "let @xmath18 be a generalized cartan matrix , in the sense of kac , and let @xmath19 be a subset of the row / column set ( identified by transpose ) such that each corresponding row or column contains at most 2 non - zero off - diagonal entries , and all such entries are @xmath20 . for simplicity , we also require that no minor consisting of rows from @xmath19 is the cartan matrix of @xmath21 .    more geometrically , consider the directed graph @xmath0 with adjacency matrix @xmath22 . throughout our paper",
    ", we will assume that @xmath0 is the graph corresponding to a symmetrizable cartan matrix .",
    "then the subgraph @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath19 must be a union of components @xmath23 with @xmath24 for some integers",
    "we call such a subgraph _ elastic_. the symbol @xmath1 will denote an elastic subgroup throughout this paper .",
    "we let @xmath26 be @xmath0 with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath27 that is , we let the selected string in our dynkin diagram grow by @xmath28 edges .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "let @xmath29 be the annihilator of the coroot lattice of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath30",
    "if @xmath31 , we will often say it `` vanishes on @xmath1 . ''",
    "if we have a weight @xmath32 vanishing on @xmath1 , we can view @xmath32 as a weight of @xmath4 for all @xmath6 ( there are minor difficulties if the cartan matrix of @xmath0 is degenerate , but this will be dealt with in later sections ) , since @xmath33 .",

    "thus @xmath32 also has an associated irreducible highest weight representation of @xmath44 , which we denote @xmath45 .",
    "let us consider the asymptotic behavior of three of the most commonly studied numerical invariants of representations of kac - moody algebras :    * the branching multiplicities fro m @xmath37 to @xmath46 : @xmath47 this is closely connected to the more often - studied branching rule for @xmath48 , but also includes the action of the full torus .",

    "the branching multiplicities @xmath57 and tensor product multiplicities @xmath58 are independent of @xmath59 .",

    "unfortunately , these multiplicities remain very mysterious objects and quite difficult to compute",
    ". it would be particularly nice if a more explicit combinatorial interpretation beyond littelmann paths or crystal graphs could be found , at least in some special cases .",
    "even if it were not computationally useful , it would represent a small window into strange world of wild kac - moody algebras .",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to deep weights in section  [ sec : deep - weights ] , followed in section  [ sec : cryst - struct - quiv ] by a review the relevant facts about quiver varieties and their connections to representation theory which will be necessary for the proof of this theorem",
    ". then we will prove parts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of theorem  [ full - statement ] in section  [ sec : stab - quiv - vari ] and section  [ sec : asympt - weight - mult ] respectively .",
    "the author would like to thank sankaran viswanath , joel kamnitzer , alistair savage and nicolai reshetikhin for their advice and help .",
    "we would also like to express our appreciation for the hospitality of the banff international research station and the efforts of the organizers of the conference `` representations of kac - moody algebras and combinatorics '' held there in march 2005 , where this research originated .",
    "let @xmath62 be the weight lattice of @xmath0 , and @xmath63 the root lattice , and let @xmath64 be the simple roots and @xmath65 the simple coroots .",
    "let @xmath66 be the set of maps @xmath67 .",
    "there are natural maps @xmath68 the map @xmath69 is obviously an isomorphism , since the simple roots @xmath64 are linearly independent after choice of a realization ( in the sense of kac ) .",
    "the map @xmath70 is surjective , but not in general injective .",
    "its kernel is naturally identified with the nullspace of the cartan matrix .",
    "still , the properties of representations important to us depend only on @xmath71 .",
    "if we have weights @xmath72 such that @xmath73 then there is a unique isomorphism @xmath74 between their crystals ( since @xmath75 as @xmath76-modules ) , so theorem  [ crystal - tens ] implies that @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we can denote this multiplicity @xmath78 without any loss of information .",
    "similarly , by the same crystal isomorphism , we can see that @xmath79 , so we can write @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 be any subgraph .",
    "we call a function @xmath84 * deep for @xmath85 * if @xmath86 is constant on each connected component @xmath87 of @xmath85",
    ". the value @xmath55 of this constant on @xmath87 is called the * @xmath88-depth * of @xmath89 .",
    "the * depth * of @xmath89 is the maximum of the @xmath87-depths . in the case",
    "where @xmath90 , we typically write @xmath54-depth for @xmath91-depth .",
    "if @xmath92 , then @xmath93 is called deep if @xmath94 is deep . a triple of weights , @xmath95 is called deep if @xmath96 is deep .",
    "depths and @xmath54-depths of weights are defined similarly .",
    "depth seems like a strong condition , but in fact , non - deep weights have a very hard time staying in the root lattice . in certain cases",
    "( @xmath97 , for example ) , the depth hypothesis in theorem  [ full - statement ] is entirely redundant .",
    "assume @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected , and @xmath98 is disconnected , so @xmath1 is connecting two separate dynkin diagrams .",
    "this situation has been studied by viswanath in @xcite .",
    "if these diagrams form an * extensible pair * as defined in @xcite then for large @xmath6 , the diagram @xmath4 has non - degenerate cartan matrix , and the fundamental weights @xmath99 make sense .",
    "thus , we have an inclusion @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .    [",
    "sec : pop - out ] _ ( viswanath ) _",
    "if @xmath92 is not deep , then @xmath102 for all @xmath6 sufficiently large .",
    "thus , @xmath9 stabilizes for all weights .",
    "while there are many examples of extensible pairs , there are a lot of cases that are not extensible and proposition  [ sec : pop - out ] fails .",
    "for example , while @xmath103 with @xmath1 connected is extensible in this sense , types @xmath104 are not , and in these cases counterexamples to proposition  [ sec : pop - out ] are easily located .",
    "interestingly , numerical evidence suggests that even in these cases , tensor product multiplicities may stabilize , but beyond computer computations and the finite and affine cases ( as described in @xcite ) , little is known about these cases .",
    "for example , let @xmath105 , with the numbering given in figure  [ fig : bn ] .",
    "for all @xmath106,@xmath107 is the spin representation , and we have the identity @xmath108 so the labeling of figure  [ fig : bn ] also represents the values of @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that @xmath110 for all @xmath106 , and is obviously not deep for any @xmath52    since @xmath111 , for all @xmath106 , @xmath112 , even though this triple is not deep .",
    "thus , in this case , and many others , we can not ignore non - deep weights .",
    "our primary tool will be the geometry of quiver varieties and its connections with representation theory , originally due to lusztig and nakajima .",
    "see the papers @xcite for more details on the construction of quiver varieties and their applications .",
    "a * quiver * is a directed graph @xmath3 .",
    "a * framed representation * of a quiver is a choice of :    * two vector spaces , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for each vertex @xmath115 , * maps @xmath116 and @xmath117 for each @xmath118 ( here we use @xmath119 and @xmath120 to denote the tail and head of the edge @xmath121 ) .",

    "this algebra is generated by elements @xmath126 for each path @xmath127 in @xmath0 , and @xmath128 for @xmath129 , with relations : @xmath130 the vector space @xmath124 is naturally a representation of this algebra with @xmath126 given by composition of @xmath131 for the edges @xmath132 , and the action of @xmath128 given by the map @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath134 be the ideal generated by all paths of length greater than 0 , and let @xmath135 be the dimension of the quotient of the vector space @xmath113 by the image of all the paths ending at @xmath16 .",

    "we let @xmath143 be the quotient of the variety of nqr s on @xmath124 under the obvious action of @xmath144 the condition of stability implies that @xmath145 acts freely on @xmath143 , so this is a geometric quotient , and using geometric invariant theory , we can give it the structure of a projective variety over @xmath146 .",
    "this is a lagrangian subvariety inside the hyperkhler quiver variety defined by nakajima in @xcite .",
    "in fact it , it is the `` core , '' in the sense of proudfoot @xcite .    up to natural isomorphism ,",
    "this variety only depends on the dimensions @xmath147 thus , we will usually denote this variety by @xmath148 without choosing fixed vector spaces of the given dimensions .",
    "let @xmath149 be the union over all @xmath89 and @xmath150 of @xmath151 .",
    "then @xmath149 also has a moduli theoretic interpretation :    let @xmath152 be a scheme over @xmath146 .",
    "then our notion of a nqr of vector spaces can be extended to an nqr of algebraic vector bundles ( i.e. locally free sheaves ) over @xmath152 .",
    "following the usual terminology of algebraic geometry , we refer to this as a family of nqr s over @xmath152 .",
    "the case of vector spaces is simply when @xmath153 .    over @xmath142 ,",
    "there is a natural , @xmath145-equivariant family @xmath154 of nqr s , which one may call * the tautological nqr*. since @xmath145 acts freely on @xmath142 , this is the pullback of an nqr @xmath155 on @xmath148 , and taking union , on @xmath149 .",
    "we call this * the universal nqr*.    consider the cofunctor @xmath156 sending a scheme over @xmath146 to the set of isomorphism classes of families of nqr s . as usual , pullback of the universal bundle by @xmath157 , gives a natural transformation of functors @xmath158 .",
    "the natural transformation @xmath159 is an isomorphism .",
    "that is , the scheme @xmath149 represents @xmath160 .",
    "since we can glue morphisms , we can reduce to the case where @xmath152 is affine and our nqr is on a trivial vector bundle @xmath161 .",
    "@xmath162 is already trivialized by the definition of an nqr .",
    "thus , we need only pick a basis of nonvanishing sections of @xmath163 . taking matrix coefficients ,",
    "this gives a map from @xmath152 to @xmath164 and thus by projection to @xmath151 .",
    "obviously , the tautological bundle on @xmath164 pulls back to @xmath161 . by transitivity of pullback",
    ", the universal bundle does as well .    of course , changing the basis results in the same map to @xmath151 via a different lift to the space of nqr s .",
    "thus the map we have constructed is unique .",

    "the geometry of the quiver variety @xmath167 interacts with the representation theory of @xmath166 in a number of interesting ways . for us , the important one will be the quiver model for the crystal @xmath12 described in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath32 be a weight for @xmath0 with @xmath168 , ( i.e. @xmath169 ) .",
    "then we have the following remarkable result from @xcite    [ crys - state ] _ ( saito )",

    "thus , the statistics of elements of the crystal which are important to us in determining tensor product multiplicities and branching rules have clear interpretations in terms of the associated quivers .    consider the open subsets of @xmath149 defined by @xmath180 these can be interpreted as moduli spaces of nqr s with fixed representation theoretic properties .    as an immediate consequence of theorem  [ crys - state ] , we see the following proposition .",

    "any reader with concerns about whether this bijection is in fact an algebraic isomorphism , need only note that the process of adding or contracting an edge can be performed in families , so it gives an isomorphism between the functors representing @xmath229 and @xmath302 .",
    "since the scheme representing a functor is unique up to isomorphism , these varieties are canonically isomorphic .",
    "this isomorphism preserves @xmath225 for all @xmath226 , since if @xmath54 is not in one of the @xmath97 strings , then the local structure of the quiver representation is unchanged .",
    "thus it also induces an isomorphism @xmath303    if @xmath0 is not simply laced , we simultaneously apply the result to all vertices covering @xmath16 in the simply laced diagram @xmath193 , and deduce the same result .",
    "as another consequence of our quiver theoretic picture of stabilization , we consider the behavior of weight multiplicities in the large @xmath6 limit of our sequence of diagrams .    as with tensor product and branching rules , the dependence of weight multiplicities on the weights involved can be rewritten in terms of functions @xmath67 .",
    "we let @xmath304 , using the notation of section  [ sec : deep - weights ] .",
    "the behavior of weight multiplicities is considerably more subtle than that of branching rules .",
    "for example , the branching rule from @xmath305 to the levi component of a parabolic is simple , well - known , and stabilizes as @xmath306 , as is clear from their description in terms of tableaux , or partial gelfand - tsetlin patterns . on the other hand ,",
    "the weyl character formula is computationally quite unwieldy .",
    "however , the large @xmath6 asymptotics of weight multiplicities for @xmath307 are reasonably well understood .",
    "[ benkart - et - al ] _ ( @xcite ) _ let @xmath308 and assume @xmath150 vanishes on some connected subdiagram @xmath1 and @xmath89 is of depth @xmath202 on @xmath1 .",
    "then for @xmath6 sufficiently large , @xmath309 is equal to a polynomial in @xmath6 of degree @xmath310 .",
    "[ polyn - behav - weight ] let @xmath313 be as in theorem  [ quiv - iso ] .",
    "then , for @xmath51 sufficiently large , the weight multiplicity @xmath314 is a polynomial in the variables @xmath315 of multidegree less than @xmath316 .",
    "let @xmath166 and @xmath318 be the kac - moody algebras corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and let @xmath319 be a cartan subalgebra of @xmath166 .",
    "any integral weight @xmath32 of @xmath0 can be considered as a integral weight on the reductive lie algebra @xmath320 .",
    "let @xmath321 be the corresponding finite dimensional highest weight representation .",
    "as with any reductive group , @xmath322 the weight @xmath40 will only appear in the @xmath93-isotypic component if @xmath323 , the positive cone in the root lattice of @xmath1 , so the @xmath40 weight space of @xmath13 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath324 taking dimensions , the result follows .",
    "thus , for large values of @xmath51 , the sum in is over a fixed set .",
    "its summands are polynomial since @xmath336 stabilizes for all @xmath251 , and by theorem  [ benkart - et - al ] , the weight multiplicity @xmath337 is a polynomial of multidegree less than @xmath338 .",
    "thus , @xmath339 is also a polynomial of multidegree @xmath340 in the variables @xmath341 .",
