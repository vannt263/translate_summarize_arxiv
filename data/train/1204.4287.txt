    "recent discovery by jin _",
    "@xcite turns the attention on another intriguing carbon structure , namely the monatomic linear carbon wire ( mlcw ) , which is the only stable structure among all forms of mlcw . in the experiment conducted by jin _",
    "_ this purely one - dimensional carbon allotrope was produced by removing carbon atoms row by row directly from the graphene sheets .",
    "apart of the earlier experiments on mlcw @xcite-@xcite , method presented in @xcite is the first one which allows to obtain remarkably stable freestanding mlcw .",

    "however , experimental research still does not provide essential knowledge about these properties of the mlcw , and only theoretical studies shed some light .    despite the fact that , mlcw were investigated for a long time from the theoretical point of view @xcite-@xcite , they were obscured by the interest on other carbon structures ( _ i.e. _ carbon nanotubes ) until the beginning of the last decade .",
    "it has been shown that , from the structural point of view mlcw can undergo the formation of either cumulene ( all atoms connected by double bonds ) or polyyne ( alternating single and triple bonds ) wires @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however , there is no straightforward answer which of these two structures is favorable one .",
    "experimental studies does not give any satisfying answer on this problem , while the theoretical results depends on the applied computational method .",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations predicts double bond structures @xcite , @xcite whereas _ ab - initio _ hartree - fock ( hf ) methods favor alternating bond systems @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "this situation arises from the fact that dft methods tend to underestimate bond alternation ( second order jahn - teller effect ) , while hf calculations overestimate it @xcite . recently however , first - principle calculations indicated , that both structures are stable , whereas cumulene presents greater stability due to the higher gibbs free energy value @xcite . furthermore , in the work by zhang _",
    "the cumulene was predicted to be extremely strong purely one - dimensional material along the axial direction @xcite .",
    "moreover , on the basis of the first - principle calculations the cumulene mlcw are expected to be almost perfect conductors @xcite-@xcite , even better then a linear gold wires @xcite , @xcite , while polyyne are semiconducting @xcite .",
    "this feature proves the fact that the physical properties of a given material in one - dimension may be drastically different from those in the bulk case .",
    "in particular , three - dimensional diamond structure of carbon is a good insulator , while quasi - one - dimensional carbon nanotubes can be either semiconducting or metallic .",
    "it is also worth to notice that mlcw may exibit conductance oscillations referred to the even or odd number of atoms in the wire @xcite , @xcite .    in our work",

    "this indicates the fact that evanescent waves do not contribute to the electronic transport , nevertheless they are required for the complete description of the multi - scattering processes .",
    "further , using expressions ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) the reflection probability for a wave incoming in a @xmath9-channel ( @xmath89 ) and the total reflection at the defect region ( @xmath90 ) , respectively , are given by @xmath91 similarly , by summing over the output and then input channels the corresponding transmission probabilities , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , can be written as @xmath94 the @xmath92 and @xmath93 probabilities are very important in the discussion of the scattering processes since they directly correspond to the experimentally measurable observable .",

    "for a computational details please see appendix [ appendixe ] .",
    "in this section we present the electronic structure calculations which allow us to establish our choice of tight - binding parameters and check its possible applications to the considered wire nanojunctions .",
    "the correctness of our results is validated by the comparison with the first - principles results after @xcite , @xcite .    in the first step of electronic structure calculations within the tight binding approximation , it is desirable to carefully choose the correct minimal basis set of the atomic wave functions .",
    "we note , that usually carbon is characterized by the 2@xmath100 and 2@xmath101 valence orbitals , where s silicon by the 3@xmath100 and 3@xmath101 atomic wave function types .",
    "such scheme is assumed in our calculations and gives us four different orbitals types ( namely @xmath100 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) for each type of the atom . additionally , as we already stated in sec .",
    "[ model dynamics ] , the described set of atomic orbitals is assumed to be of orthonormal character .",
    "however , in contrast to our choice , the electronic and transport properties of the nanoscale systems are usually described in the framework of the sophisticated non - orthogonal tight binding methods . in our opinion",
    ", such tight binding models may artificially complicate the calculations in the case of the low - coordinated systems like mono- or di - atomic wire nanojunctions .",
    "on the basis of other experimental and theoretical studies one can easily notice that the atomic wires have relatively simple structural and electronic characteristics .",
    "these facts proves , that for the calculations of electronic and transport properties of discussed atomic wires it is reasonable to consider the orthonormal rather then non - orthogonal tight binding model .    in our case",
    "the electronic states of the considered nanojunctions are described in the framework of the tight binding approach proposed by harrison .",
    "this approach allow us to introduce previously described orthonormal simplifications in the theoretical formalism and still keep the physical character of the tight binding parameters .",
    "we would like to turn readers attention on the fact that , in some models the tight binding parameters are considered more like fitting parameters then physical observable . in our opinion , such approach is incorrect , since it do not provide full physical discussion of the electronic states .    in its original form",
    "the htbt model is considered as a transferable method for tetrahedral phases @xcite . in particular , the values provided by the classical form of the htbt , results in only qualitative description of the electronic states for the atomic wires composed of the low lying chemical elements @xcite .",
    "however , one can put aside the universality of the htbt approach and adjust these parameters to the experimental or first principle results by varying their values .    in the present work",
    "the classical htbt parameters has been rescaled in order to match the density functional theory results presented in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the values of the tb parameters utilized in our work along with its comparison to the classical values by harrison are presented in tab .",
    "we would like to indicate that in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] both sets of parameters ( the classical and re - parametrized ones ) have the same relation to the physical quantities . in particular , the binding energies have fixed negative values which are relative to the energy of the electron in isolated hydrogen atom . additionally we note , that the values of the on - site hamiltonian matrix elements for states @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the same and equal @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath4 parameters the off - diagonal distance dependent elements are calculated on the basis of eq.([eq2 ] ) and can be either positive or negative .",
    "this situation arises from the fact that one have to require the cohesive character of the interatomic forces . with the reference to this assumption",
    ", the interactions between orbitals of the same sign causes overlap of those orbitals to be positive , so the parameter @xmath5 must be negative . in analogy , negative overlap between orbitals of different signs provide positive value of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "the off - diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements for interactions between @xmath100 and @xmath101-type states are included only between @xmath100 and @xmath102 orbitals , since interactions between @xmath100 and @xmath103 or @xmath104 states vanishes in the one - dimensional case in order to the symmetry conditions .",
    "additionally we assume the interactions between @xmath102 states as @xmath106 , while the elements for interactions @xmath103-@xmath103 and @xmath104-@xmath104 are equal in energies and assumed as @xmath107 .",
    "we note that , except of the @xmath101-state binding energy of silicon , all values of the tb parameters proposed in this work are smaller then in its classical form of the harrison model .",
    "one can attribute this fact to the influence of the local environment of the low - coordinate systems , for which the binding energies are usually smaller then in a bulk case .",
    "however the value of the @xmath101-state binding energy of silicon is somehow greater when compared to the harrison fit . in our opinion",
    "it is due to the lack of the additional high - energy orbitals on the basis set _",
    "e.g. _ the peripheral louie - type @xmath108 state @xcite . in the case of the nearest - neighbor coupling terms",
    "one can notice that the relations between the consecutive parameters for carbon and silicon are identical as in its classical forms .",

    "( [ fig5 ] ) , the group velocities of electrons in the mlcw perfect leads are presented .",
    "it is these group velocities of the electrons incident from the perfect leads , which are used to normalize the scattering matrix .            in particular , five different arrangements of the silicon atoms in the nanojunction region have been considered ( please see fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) ) . the first three represents periodic dlsicw composed of respectively 1 , 2 , and 3 si - c atomic pairs .",

    "is used systematically as a check on the numerical results .",
    "finally , the fermi level is marked by dashed lines and set as reference at zero energy .",
    "once again we impose the fact that , on the zero bias limit , the total conductance is read at this fermi level .    on the basis of obtained results we observe that , the transmission spectra presents strongly localized scattering resonances , which number differ depending on the number of silicon atoms on the nanowire . in what follows , valence @xmath119-state ( state 1 ) exhibit small transmission in each of the five considered nanojunctions . only in the cases 2 and 3",
    "narrow transmission peaks can be noticed . at the zero bias limit the most significant channels",
    "are constituted by the degenerate @xmath15-type states ( state 2 and 3 ) , since only these states crosses the fermi level .",
    "apart of this fact , also the characteristics of the high - energy states ( state 4 ) may prove to be useful in the discussion of the electronic transport across the silicon - doped carbon wires .",
    "in each of the five cases , the transmission around the energy of 5 ev is close to the unit .",
    "this fact will be important , when applied bias rise the energy of the incident electrons , allows them to be transmitted at higher , then the fermi level , energies .",
    "the total conductance of the considered systems has been depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) , as a function of energy ( red solid lines ) .",
    "we note that @xmath126 is expressed in the @xmath96 units of the conductance quantum .",
    "furthermore , we have plotted the conductance of the infinite mlcw ( solid light blue line ) and the felmi level position ( dashed lines ) .",
    "function is expressed in the @xmath96 units , and the fermi level is set at zero energy reference position ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "the total conductance spectra directly correspond to the transmission probabilities of the appropriate nanojunction wires presented in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath15-type states ( states 2 and 3 ) are degenerate , the value of the @xmath126 in the energy range of these states is in fact , the summation over these two identical channels . in addition",
    ", we notice that , the most significant contribution to the total conductance in the zero bias limit is given by these degenerate @xmath15-type states , since only these states of the perfect leads crosses the fermi level . in particular , for the three first cases which represent the dlsicw of different lengths , the total conductance at the fermi level is non - zero .",
    "this observation is in contradiction to the insulating character of the infinite dlsicw . on",
    "can connect the non - zero value of the conductance of a short dlsicw nanojunction wires to the band gap around the fermi level in the infinite dlsicw systems ( please see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "further , this band gap is related to the difference between the binding energies of the silicon and carbon atoms , respectively .",
    "mentioned energy difference creates the effective potential barrier for the electron crossing the nanojuction region from left to the right lead . when the wire length is increased the incident electrons encounter periodic repetition of such silicon - carbon potential barriers , and the cumulative effect of the conductance value decrease when the length of the dlsicw nanojuntion increases ,",
    "is observed . in our results",
    "this effect can be observed both in figures ( [ fig7 ] ) and ( [ fig8 ] ) , where the transmission and consecutively total conductance spectra around the fermi level exhibits minima .",
    "these minima are stronger when the wire nanojunctions are longer .",
    "the two remaining silicon - carbon nanojuctions of cases 4 and 5 , respectively , are no longer of the periodic types . in the case 4",
    ", the number of the silicon atoms on the nanowire is the same as in the case 3 , however there is no more long range order in the arrangement of the carbon and silicon atoms .",
    "such structural defect , for relatively short wires , completely decreases value of the @xmath126 at the femi level to zero .",
    "further , in the fifth case , the number of the silicon atoms outnumber carbon atoms in the nanojunction region .",
    "similarly as in the case of the 4 , the total conductance at the fermi level is zero , however the overall shape to the @xmath126 spectra is different .",
    "i this case the zero value of the conductance is imposed by the large number of the chemical defects constituted by the silicon atoms on the nanojunction wire .",
    "in the present work , the electronic and transport properties of the silicon - doped carbon wire nanojunctions wires are discussed within the phase field matching theory on the level of the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the minimal basis of the atomic wave functions is assumed to be composed of four different atomic orbitals , namely the @xmath100 , @xmath127 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 types .    in the first step of our discussion ,",
    "we present new values of the tight - binding parameters for the prefect infinite carbon ( mlcw ) , silicon ( mlsiw ) , and silicon - carbide ( dlsicw ) nanojunction wires , by matching these to the previously reported density functional results . during the fitting procedure we benefit form the harrion tight - bidning scheme , which allows us to neglect the overlap hamiltonian terms , and assume the two - center approximation for the hamiltonian interaction integrals .",
    "such set of the tight - binding parameters is then used in order to calculate the electronic transport properties of the silicon - doped carbon wire nanojunctions wires . in particular , we consider five different cases of the atoms arrangement on the nanojunction region .",
    "we show , that apart of the infinite insulating dlsicw nanojunctions its finite implementation exhibit a non - zero conductance values . this fact is explained by arguing that the energy difference between the binding energies of the silicon and carbon atoms results in the effective potential barrier for the electron crossing the nanojuction region from left to the right lead .",
    "next we consider the structural defect in the diatomic silicon - carbon arrangement of the atoms on the nanojunction wire . by changing the position of two silicon and carbon atoms",
    "we show that the total conductance of the systems drops when comparing to the corresponding periodic configuration of the atoms , resulting in the zero value of the total conductance . in the last step ,",
    "we present the case when the silicon atoms outnumber the carbon atoms on the nanojunction region .",
    "again , the zero conductance of the system is observed .",
    "this is due to the chemical defect influence of the relatively large number of the silicon atoms .    in summary ,",
    "the pfmt method prove to be useful tool for the quantum transport calculations , and may be considered as a alternative to the non - equlibrium green s function methods .",
    "furthermore , it is especially interesting for the treatment of complex systems presenting multi - channel conductance , and for the calculation of the conductance properties of nanojuctions which can exhibit electron - phonon interactions with or without chemical and structural defects .",
