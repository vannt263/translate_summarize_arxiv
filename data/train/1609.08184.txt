    "the global geometry of a given hilbert scheme is generally very difficult to study .",
    "recently , the theory of bridgeland stability has provided a new set of tools to study the geometry of these hilbert schemes .",
    "for instance , the study of the hilbert scheme of points on surfaces has benefited from these new tools .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "a sensible step forward is now to apply these tools to examine families of curves contained in threefolds .",
    "the first instance of this was carried out by the last author in @xcite , where he studies the hilbert scheme of twisted cubics .",
    "this paper continues this investigation about curves in @xmath0 and analyzes the global geometry , as well as wall - crossing phenomena , of the hilbert scheme @xmath1 , which parametrizes subschemes of @xmath0 of genus @xmath2 and degree @xmath3 .",
    "a smooth curve of genus @xmath2 and degree @xmath3 in @xmath0 , which we refer to as an elliptic quartic , is the transversal intersection of two quadric surfaces . by considering the pencil",
    "that these quadrics generate , we realize the family of smooth elliptic quartics as an open subset of @xmath4 , the grassmannian of lines in the space @xmath5 of quadric surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the hilbert scheme @xmath1 is a moduli space of bridgeland stable objects and moreover , it is related through birational transformations to the grasmannian @xmath4 via wall - crossing .",
    "let us recall the notion of bridgeland stability in order to state this result precisely .",
    "recall that for classical slope - stability with respect to a given polarization @xmath6 on a smooth projective complex variety @xmath7 , one defines a number @xmath8 called the slope for any coherent sheaf @xmath9 . a coherent sheaf is then called slope semistable if all proper non trivial subsheaves have smaller slope . for bridgeland stability ,",
    "one replaces the category of coherent sheaves with a different abelian subcategory @xmath10 and replaces the slope with a homomorphism @xmath11 , mapping @xmath12 to the upper half plane or the negative real line , where @xmath13 is the grothendieck group .",
    "the slope is then given by @xmath14 for any @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , one demands that every object in @xmath16 has a canonical filtration into semistable factors called the harder - narasimhan filtration and the so called support property , which ensures that the set of stability conditions @xmath17 can be naturally given the structure of a complex manifold .",
    "we can now state our main result .",
    "let us fix a class @xmath18 , then there is a locally finite wall and chamber structure in @xmath17 , such that the set of semistable objects of class @xmath19 is constant within each chamber .",
    "our main result describes the wall and chamber structure of a subspace of @xmath20 as well as the corresponding moduli spaces of semistable objects in the case of elliptic quartics in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an elliptic quartic curve .",
    "there is a path @xmath23 \\to \\r_{>0 } \\times \\r \\subset \\stab(\\p^3)$ ] such that the moduli spaces of semistable objects with chern character @xmath19 in its image outside of walls are given in the following order .    1 .   the empty space @xmath24 .",
    "2 .   the grassmannian @xmath25 .",
    "the second moduli space @xmath26 is the blow up of @xmath4 along a smooth locus isomorphic to @xmath27 .",
    "the third moduli space @xmath28 has two irreducible components @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the first component @xmath29 is the blow up of @xmath26 along the smooth incidence variety parametrizing length two subschemes in a plane in @xmath0 .",
    "the second component @xmath30 is a @xmath31-bundle over @xmath32 .",
    "the two components intersect transversally in the exceptional locus of the blow up .",
    "the fourth moduli space @xmath33 has two irreducible components @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the first component is equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the second component is birational to @xmath30 .",
    "the fifth moduli space is the hilbert scheme @xmath1 , which has two components : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the principal component @xmath36 contains an open subset of elliptic quartic curves and is equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the second component is of dimension @xmath38 and is birational to @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the two components intersect transversally along a locus of dimension @xmath39 .    bwalls ( 12 , 50 ) @xmath1 ( 12 , 12 ) @xmath33 ( 23 , 12 ) @xmath28 ( 60 , 12 ) @xmath26 ( 95 , 12 ) @xmath4 ( 130 , 12 ) @xmath40    as a consequence of theorem a , we obtain that the hilbert scheme @xmath1 has two components .",
    "the previous result describes what is called the principal component , which parametrizes smooth elliptic curves along with their flat limits .",
    "we will denote this component by @xmath36 , and our next result describes its global geometry .",
    "the closure of the family of smooth elliptic quartics in the hilbert scheme @xmath1 , is a double blowup of the grassmannian @xmath4 along smooth centers .",
    "a comment is in order about the previous theorem .",
    "the description of @xmath41 above was proved in @xcite by vainsencher and avritzer using classical methods .",
    "our techniques to reprove their result are distinct , as we make use of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 and bridgeland stability .",
    "the notion of tilt stability on a smooth projective threefold was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is defined in a similar way one defines bridgeland stability on a surface , thus these two notions of stability share computational properties .",
    "tilt stability is intended as a stepping stone to bridgeland stability .",
    "the proof of theorem a is largely based on this theory .",
    "in contrast to the surface case , computing which objects destabilize at a given wall is difficult due to the lack of unique stable factors in the jordan - hlder filtration of a strictly semistable object .",
    "computing the walls numerically in tilt stability is of similar difficulty as in the surface case and often times possible . on the other hand , while it is generally difficult to determine all walls in bridgeland stability on a given path , it is not so difficult to determine which objects destabilize at a given wall . in order to resolve this issue",
    "we apply a technique from @xcite that allows to translate walls from tilt stability into bridgeland stability .    in order to identify the global structure of the bridgeland moduli spaces a careful analysis of its singularities",
    "is necessary .",
    "we apply deformation theory to these problems and large parts of it reduce to heavy @xmath42-computation .",
    "even though this can be done by hand , computer calculations with @xcite turn out to be tremendously helpful .",
    "the situation is more involved when it comes to the intersection of the two components .",
    "we reduce the question to a single ideal in that case and apply the technique of @xcite .",
    "we make use of the macaulay2 implementation @xcite of this technique .      in section 1 ,",
    "we recall basic definitions about stability conditions . in section 2 , we carry out numerical computations in tilt stability needed to understand walls in bridgeland stability . in section 3 , we describe the equations of some ideals depending on the exact sequences they fit in .",
    "we use this description to understand the local geometry of the intersection of the two components of our hilbert scheme . in section 4",
    ", we translate the computations in tilt stability to bridgeland stability .",
    "furthermore , we analyze singularities to provide a proof of theorem a and theorem b.      we would like to thank francesco cavazzani , dawei chen , joe harris , and emanuele macr for insightful discussions about this work . c. lozano huerta and b. schmidt would also like to thank the organizers of the ii elga school in cabo frio , brazil for organizing a wonderful conference supported by nsf grant dms-1502154 at which parts of this work was done .",

    "it is interesting to note that all relevant objects in this theorem are sheaves and no actual 2-term complexes .",
