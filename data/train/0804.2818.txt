    "we assume that all grbs , both `` long '' and `` short '' , originate from the gravitational collapse to a black hole.@xcite the @xmath0 plasma created in the process of the black hole formation expands as an optically thick and spherically symmetric `` fireshell '' with a constant width in the laboratory frame , i.e. the frame in which the black hole is at rest .",
    "we have only two free parameters characterizing the source : the total energy of the @xmath0 plasma @xmath1 and the @xmath0 plasma baryon loading @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total baryons mass .",
    "these two parameters fully determine the optically thick acceleration phase of the fireshell , which lasts until the transparency condition is reached and the proper - grb ( p - grb ) is emitted.@xcite the afterglow emission then starts due to the collision between the remaining optically thin fireshell and the circumburst medium ( cbm).@xcite it clearly depends on the parameters describing the effective cbm distribution : its density @xmath4 and the ratio @xmath5 between the effective emitting area of the fireshell @xmath6 and its total visible area @xmath7 .",

    "unlike treatments in the current literature,@xcite we define a `` canonical grb '' light curve with two sharply different components ( see fig .  [ figx ] and refs .  ):    * * the p - grb * , which has the imprint of the black hole formation , an harder spectrum and no spectral lag ; * * the afterglow * , which presents a clear hard - to - soft behavior;@xcite the peak of the afterglow contributes to what is usually called the `` prompt emission '' ..    the ratio between the total time - integrated luminosity of the p - grb ( namely , its total energy ) and the corresponding one of the afterglow is the crucial quantity for the identification of grbs nature . such a ratio , as well as the temporal separation between the corresponding peaks , is a function of the @xmath8 parameter ( see fig .  [ figx ] and ref .  ) .",
    "when @xmath10 , the p - grb is the leading contribution to the emission and the afterglow is negligible : we have a `` genuine '' short grb.@xcite when @xmath11 , instead , the afterglow contribution is generally predominant .",
    "still , this case presents two distinct possibilities : the afterglow peak luminosity can be either * larger * or * smaller * than the p - grb one .",
    "the simultaneous occurrence of an afterglow with total time - integrated luminosity larger than the p - grb one , but with a smaller peak luminosity , can indeed be explained in terms of a peculiarly small average value of the cbm density ( @xmath12 particles/@xmath13 ) , compatible with a galactic halo environment ( `` fake '' short grbs ) ."
