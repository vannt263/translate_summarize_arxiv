    "low - mass main sequence stars of spectral class m ( m dwarfs , or dm stars ) are the most abundant stars in the galaxy , representing about 75% of the total stellar population .",
    "their low masses ( 0.08 - 0.8 m@xmath4 ) allow them to have main sequence lifetimes of the order of @xmath10 years ( or more ) , i.e. , significantly longer than the age of the universe . during this time the dm stars present nearly constant luminosities ( @xmath11 @xmath12l@xmath4 , @xcite ) .",
    "these peculiar characteristics make them interesting systems to search for habitable planets . however , there are some issues that make the habitability of planets around these stars a matter of debate .",
    "we will not review here the habitability issues related to planets around m stars , referring the reader to the papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "m stars exhibit significant temporal variability as a consequence of phenomena occurring in the region from their photospheres to their coronae . as a result",
    ", they emit large amounts of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation and x - rays during their active periods and strong stellar winds .",
    "this stellar activity can have several effects on a planet . in this paper",
    "we focus on the interaction of stellar winds with the atmosphere of planets around these stars .",
    "stellar winds are mainly charged particles ( protons and electrons ) ejected from the outer stellar atmosphere driven by the pressure - expansion of the hot corona .",
    "it has been calculated that the m dwarf stellar winds are denser and faster than winds from solar - like stars @xcite , and these winds may be able to erode the atmospheres of planets around the stars .",
    "the partial or total erosion of a planetary atmosphere affects directly the habitability of a planet , since a main requirement for the development of life on its surface is the presence of an atmosphere .",
    "the planetary atmosphere stabilizes the surface temperature and provides the pressure for water to be liquid , an essential requirement for life .",
    "therefore , if a planetary atmosphere is removed by the stellar wind from its parent star ( or any other process for that matter ) , this represents a serious problem for the habitability of the planet . for habitable planets around m dwarfs",
    ", the stellar wind may have a larger effect , not only because it is denser and faster than the winds from solar - type stars , but because their habitable zones ( hz ) correspond to orbits very near to the star .",
    "the concept of hz is commonly used in the context of planets that might be suitable to keep life on their surface .",
    "there are many definitions for the hz ( @xmath13.@xmath14 @xcite and @xcite ) but we take here kasting s concept which is defined as the region around a star in which a planet with an atmosphere is able to support liquid water on the surface @xcite . the formal definition is related to the stellar luminosity by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance from the planet to the star , @xmath17 is the stellar luminosity and l@xmath18 is the solar luminosity . for the m dwarf case",
    "this distance is @xmath190.2 au from the star .",
    "planets in the hz of m dwarfs would become tidally locked in about 1 gyr or less @xcite .",
    "calculations indicate that the magnetic moment of a tidally locked terrestrial planet may be 10 to 100 less intense than earth s magnetic moment .",
    "because it is likely that planets in the hz of m dwarfs have weak magnetic fields , here we assume the extreme case where the planet has no intrinsic magnetic field , like venus .",
    "the search for extrasolar planets is an interesting issue in the context of astrobiology .",
    "the smaller planets have been found orbiting dm stars , due to the fact that it is easier to observe exoplanets with the current techniques ( gravitational lensing , radial velocities or transits ) around less luminous stars .",
    "since it is potentially possible to detect habitable planets around m dwarf stars , the study of the habitability conditions of these planets is decisive in the search for life around dm stars .",
    "some recent exoplanet searches such as corot ( convection , rotation & planetary transits ) @xcite and harps ( high accuracy radial velocity planetary search project ) @xcite are dedicated to looking for planets with earth - like masses around m dwarfs .",
    "we first carry out an estimate of the atmospheric mass loss due to the interaction of a stellar wind of density @xmath20 and velocity @xmath21 with a planetary atmosphere .",
    "for an earth - type planet , the atmosphere is a thin , gaseous layer covering the planet .",
    "therefore , both the inner and outer radii of the atmosphere are @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radius of the planet .    for a planet with no magnetic field , the impinging stellar wind will form a bow shock around the body of the planet and its atmosphere . for low enough stellar wind densities this bow shock will not exist and",
    "the stellar wind will be directly absorbed by the planetary atmosphere . for a stellar wind / planet interaction in which the bow show does exist",
    "the post - bow shock material will have a sound speed @xmath24 ( as the shock will be strong due to the hypersonic nature of the stellar wind ) .",
    "the post - bow shock flow will envelop the leading hemisphere of the planet , and a turbulent mixing layer will be formed on the contact surface between the shocked wind and the planetary ionosphere .",
    "the shocked wind is stationary in the stagnation region of the bow shock , and has an increasing velocity towards the bow shock wings , reaching velocities of @xmath25 towards the edge of the leading hemisphere of the planet / wind interaction flow .    from the mixing layer formalism of @xcite",
    "it is straightforward to show that a flow with a sound speed @xmath25 and a tangential velocity of the same order has an entrained mass flux is @xmath26 ( where @xmath0 is an entrainment efficiency which is determined through fitting the mixing layer model to laboratory experiments ) . multiplying the entrained mass flux by the surface of the leading hemisphere ,",
    "we then obtain an estimate for the atmospheric mass per unit time entrained by the stellar wind : @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the atmospheric mass loss .",
    "this equation can be combined with the relation @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the stellar mass loss rate and @xmath16 is the orbital radius of the planet ) to obtain : @xmath31    through comparisons with laboratory experiments of plane , turbulent mixing layers , @xcite determined an @xmath32 entrainment efficiency .",
    "it is of course not clear whether or not this value for @xmath0 is appropriate for the different flow geometry of our stellar wind / planetary atmosphere interaction model .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite suggested that the value of @xmath33 for the case of venus . in order to sample the possible range of @xmath0 values we use @xmath340.01 and 0.3 .",
    "we should note that the interaction between the solar wind and venus is found to be more complex than we have described above .",
    "for example , a magnetic barrier ( of compressed , magnetized solar wind material ) is formed in the solar wind / planetary ionosphere interface @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon could modify the properties of the entrainment process in a substantial way .",
    "therefore , our entrainment model should be considered as a parametrization with which a range of possible entrainment rates can be explored regardless of the physical constraints for the @xmath0 parameter .      in order to estimate the initial atmospheric mass @xmath35 as a function of the surface atmospheric pressure @xmath36",
    ", we use the hydrostatic equation for an isothermal atmosphere in the form : @xmath37 where @xmath36 is the surface pressure , @xmath23 the planetary radius and @xmath14 the gravitational acceleration at the planetary surface",
    ". this equation can be combined with the relations @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the gravitational constant and @xmath40 the planetary mass ) and @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the average density of the planet ) to obtain @xmath43 we now consider planets with different masses @xmath40 , assuming the earth average density ( i.e. , @xmath44 g  @xmath45 ) , and from eq .",

    "if the mass loss rate of the star @xmath30 is time - independent , the timescale @xmath52 is equal to the time for total erosion of the planetary atmosphere . from eq .",

    "if proxima centauri is a young star ( @xmath115 1 gyr ) as obtained by @xcite , then its initial mass loss rate would be @xmath116 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "for the case of other dme stars that are considered young , like yz cmi ( dm4.5e ) and ad leo ( dm3.5e ) @xcite , the calculated maximum for their mass loss rate is @xmath111 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the age of these stars lies somewhere between 0.5 gyr @xcite and 1 gyr @xcite .",

    "yz cmi and ad leo are among the most active m dwarfs , and we would therefore expect that they represent an upper limit for m dwarf mass loss rates .    here",
    "we are considering that the mass loss rate for dm stars is time dependent , but observations indicate that some m dwarfs may not follow the time dependence proposed by @xcite . for example , @xcite found that the lower mass m dwarfs ( spectral types m3 and later ) are more likely to be active at old ages than higher mass m dwarfs ( m0-m3 ) .",
    "m stars in clusters with spectral types m3 and later seem to remain active for more than 4 gyr @xcite .",

    "because most of early type m dwarfs are not active @xcite we would expect that their mass loss rates would be less than the observed @xmath121 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 for the most active m dwarfs ( yz cmi and ad leo ) .",

    "because the habitable zone of m dwarfs is very close to the star ( @xmath1232 au ) planets in that hz may be tidally locked and therefore slow rotators . as a consequence",
    "these planets may have weak magnetic fields @xcite . in this work we have considered the extreme case of planets with no magnetic field .",

    "we find that our time - independet stellar wind model predicts similar results to the ones found by using detailed models of the atmospheric erosion of venus .",
    "therefore , our model is valid to test if a planet is able to keep its atmosphere for a certain period of time . in other words ,",
    "if one planet ( under the assumption that the planet has no magnetic field ) does nt pass our test , it is not necessary to analyze the atmospheric erosion with more detailed models .",
    "based on observations of m dwarfs we derive that our time dependent model may better describe early type m dwarfs ( earlier than m5 ) and the case for constant stellar mass loss more appropriate for the interaction of m dwarfs with spectral types later than m5 with the atmospheres of planets in their habitable zones .",
    "our results indicate that early type m dwarfs may are more promising for habitable planets searches because there are several planetary mass / atmospheric mass combinations for which a planet without magnetic field in the habitable zone may preserve its atmosphere for at least 1 gyr .",
    "planets in the habitable zone of active late type stars ( later than m5 ) are less likely to keep their atmospheres for 1 gyr or more .",
    "it is clear that more observations are needed to narrow down the mass loss rate values for m dwarfs .",
    "particularly , such mass loss rate determinations will have to be made for m dwarfs in which the presence of planets is indeed detected , so as to be able to determine ( from our model ) whether or not the planets are candidates for the presence of life .",
    "we end the discussion by noting that our model for the erosion of planetary atmospheres is restricted to the case of planets with no magnetic fields .",
    "clearly , the presence of a planetary magnetosphere would protect the atmosphere , and may allow the planet to preserve its atmosphere for longer timescales in the presence of stellar winds with higher mass loss rates .",
    "the study of the survival of the atmosphere of a magnetized planet under the interaction with an m dwarf wind is left for a future study .",

    "<S> we present an analytic model for the interaction between planetary atmospheres and stellar winds from main sequence m stars , with the purpose of obtaining a quick test - model that estimates the timescale for total atmospheric mass loss due to this interaction . </S>",
    "<S> planets in the habitable zone of m dwarfs may be tidally locked and may have weak magnetic fields , because of this we consider the extreme case of planets with no magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the model gives the planetary atmosphere mass loss rate as a function of the stellar wind and planetary properties ( mass , atmospheric pressure and orbital distance ) and an entrainment efficiency coefficient @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we use a mixing layer model to explore two different cases : a time - independent stellar mass loss and a stellar mass loss rate that decreases with time . for both cases we consider planetary masses within the range of @xmath1 m@xmath2 and atmospheric pressures with values of 1 , 5 and 10 atm . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our model to venus by estimating its atmospheric mass loss rate by the interaction with the solar wind and compare our model with more detailed simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good agreement between our results and the atmospheric mass loss obtained by more detailed models , and it is therefore appropriate for carrying out an exploration of the broad parameter space of exoplanetary systems . </S>",
    "<S> for the time dependent case , planets without magnetic field in the habitable zone of m dwarfs with initial stellar mass losses of @xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , may retain their atmospheres for at least 1 gyr . this case </S>",
    "<S> may be applied to early spectral type m dwarfs ( earlier than m5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> studies have shown that late type m dwarfs ( later than m5 ) may be active for long periods of time ( @xmath6gyr ) , and because of that our model with constant stellar mass loss rate may be more accurate . for these stars most planets may have lost their atmospheres in 1 gyr or less because most of the late type m dwarfs are expected to be active . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our model only considers planets without magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> clearly we must expect a higher resistance to atmospheric erosion if we include the presence of a magnetic field . nevertheless , as a first approximation our model is able to give a reliable time scale , as evidence by comparing our results with more detailed models .    </S>",
