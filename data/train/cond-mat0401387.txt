    "nanoelectromechanical systems in which a nanomechanical resonator is coupled to a mesoscopic conductor , such as a single - electron transistor ( set ) , form a new class of mesoscopic system in which there is a fascinating interplay between the electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom .",
    "coupling to nanomechanical degrees of freedom can modify the transport properties of mesoscopic conductors substantially , giving rise to a number of novel phenomena such as electron shuttling@xcite and phonon blockade effects.@xcite furthermore , nanoelectromechanical systems have important potential applications as ultra - sensitive force detectors.@xcite    a nanomechanical resonator coated with a thin metal layer can be coupled to a set as a mechanically compliant voltage - gate.@xcite under such circumstances the tunnelling rates of electrons through the set island , and hence the current flowing , depend sensitively on the position of the resonator.@xcite it has been suggested that the set could act as a quantum - limited displacement detector for micron - sized resonators@xcite thus making it potentially very important both for read - out of the resonator s motion in force sensing applications@xcite and for exploring quantum effects in electromechanical systems.@xcite however , fluctuations in the charge on the set island exert a stochastic force back on the resonator , affecting its motion , and hence also the average current through the set.@xcite furthermore , the coupling between the resonator and the set also has an important influence on the set current noise .",
    "the effect on the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator of coupling to a mesoscopic conductor has been investigated by a number of authors.@xcite for systems where the nanomechanical resonator forms a compliant voltage gate adjacent to either a set@xcite or a quantum point contact,@xcite it has been found that the interaction with the electrons drives the resonator into a steady - state very similar to a thermal state , with an effective temperature and damping constant . in particular , when the resonator is treated as a quantum system it is found that whenever the energy associated with the bias voltage applied across the conductor is much greater than the energy quanta of the resonator , the electrons rapidly dephase the resonator and heat it to an effective temperature proportional to the bias voltage.@xcite an analysis of the dynamics of a resonator coupled to a set where the resonator is treated as a classical system leads to very similar conclusions in the regime where the applied bias voltage is relatively large and the charge dynamics of the set is adequately described by the orthodox model.@xcite    although the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a mesoscopic conductor has been investigated for a number of different systems and regimes , there has been little systematic study of the concomitant current - noise spectrum of the mesoscopic conductor .",
    "knowledge of the current - noise spectrum in nanoelectromechanical systems is of interest both because it sets limits on the sensitivity with which the current can be used as measure of the motion of the resonator and , more generally , because it has long been recognized that the current noise of mesoscopic conductors provides important additional information , beyond that available from simple average - current properties , about the interactions which the conduction electrons undergo.@xcite in this paper the current noise of a set coupled to a nanomechanical resonator is calculated in the classical regime using an extension of the master equation approach developed in ref .  .",
    "it is found that the current noise spectrum of the set - resonator system can be very different from that of the uncoupled set . in particular , the interactions between the resonator and the transport electrons can strongly enhance the set current noise at low frequencies and give rise to additional peaks in the noise spectrum at the resonator frequency and at twice that value .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the dynamical model of the coupled resonator - set system that forms the basis of the following calculations is introduced . then in sec .",
    "iii , the relationship between the overall current noise spectrum of the set and the spectrum of the charge noise on the island and the noise spectra of the tunnel currents between the island and the leads is described . in secs .",
    "iv and v the noise spectra of the tunnel currents through the set junctions and the charge noise on the set island are obtained , respectively .",
    "the full current noise spectrum of the coupled set - resonator system is obtained in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii contains the conclusions .",
    "a schematic diagram of the set - resonator system is shown in fig.[fig : schema ] . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed a symmetric arrangement of capacitances and voltages .",
    "the set island is connected to current leads by tunnel junctions with capacitance @xmath0 and resistance @xmath1 .",
    "the total voltage applied across the set island is @xmath2 .",
    "the nanomechanical resonator forms the gate capacitor , with a capacitance @xmath3 , and a voltage @xmath4 applied to it .",
    "the gate capacitance depends on the displacement of the resonator , @xmath5 , about its equilibrium separation from the set island , @xmath6 .",
    "the resonator is displaced from its equilibrium position by fluctuations in the set charge and by thermal fluctuations of the resonator itself , but for realistic systems@xcite the resulting motion is on a scale much less than the equilibrium separation ( i.e. @xmath7 ) , hence an expansion of the capacitance to linear order is sufficient and we may write @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant.@xcite the gate capacitance is also assumed to be much less than that of the junction capacitances , @xmath10 , which reflects the situation in typical devices .    under a relatively wide range of conditions , the coupled dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator and a set can be described using a master equation formalism.@xcite within this formalism , the set is assumed to be within the regime where the orthodox model is valid and the resonator is treated as a classical harmonic oscillator , with angular frequency @xmath11 , and effective mass @xmath12 .",
    "the effects of damping processes on the resonator , beyond those due to interactions with the set , can be taken into account by including an extrinsic damping rate , @xmath13 .",
    "the orthodox model describes electron transport through the set away from the coulomb blockade regions so that processes other than sequential tunnelling of electrons may be neglected.@xcite the nanomechanical resonator is expected to behave classically whenever the bias voltage applied to the set is much greater than the energy quanta of the resonator , i.e.  @xmath14.@xcite complete details of the derivation , justification and analysis of this classical model for the coupled set - resonator system are given in ref .  .",
    "when the background temperature of the set - resonator system , @xmath15 , is much less than the charging energy of the set island , @xmath16 , and the bias voltage is not too large , the charge state of the set island can be assumed to be limited to two possible values , @xmath17 and @xmath18 excess electrons , and a pair of coupled master equations can be derived for the set - resonator system .",
    "the bias voltage is also assumed to be much greater than the background temperature , @xmath19 , and so the effects of thermal fluctuations on the electron tunnel rates are neglected.@xcite writing @xmath20 as the probability of having @xmath21 electrons on the set island and finding the resonator at position @xmath5 and with velocity @xmath22 , the master equations for the evolution of the probability distributions take the form@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the position - independent part of the tunnel rate through the @xmath27 junction .",
    "the length - scale @xmath28 has a simple interpretation : it is the amount by which the equilibrium separation between the set and the resonator changes when the charge on the set island changes from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the master equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ spn ] ) and ( [ spn1 ] ) ] assume that the bias voltage applied across the system is the dominant energy - scale and the probability distributions for the resonator are strongly peaked at @xmath29 . under such circumstances , which are readily met in practicable resonator - set systems,@xcite",
    "tunnelling processes that go against the direction imposed by the bias voltage may be neglected .",
    "the resulting master equations can be used to extract equations of motion for the average properties of the resonator and set , and to characterize the steady - state of the system .",
    "furthermore , the master equations provide the necessary information about the coupled dynamics of the set - resonator system to allow the derivation of the set current noise spectrum .",
    "analysis of the coupled master equations@xcite shows that the set electrons act on the resonator like another thermal bath ( in addition to the substrate to which the resonator is attached ) which can be characterized by an intrinsic temperature , @xmath30 , proportional to @xmath2 , and an intrinsic damping constant , @xmath31 .",
    "the overall effective temperature of the resonator is then determined by an average of the temperatures of the two baths at temperatures @xmath30 and @xmath15 , with weights that depend on the respective damping constants @xmath31 and @xmath13.@xcite    the strength of the interaction between the resonator and the set is conveniently described by the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 and the frequency by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electron tunnelling time . in terms of these dimensionless parameters ,",
    "the intrinsic damping rate of the resonator due to interactions with the electrons is @xcite @xmath35 the interaction of the resonator with the electrons also leads to a slight renormalization of resonator frequency , @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the external temperature is conveniently expressed in terms of the drain - source voltage as the dimensionless parameter , @xmath37 .",
    "the noise in the current through a set is generated by the fluctuations in the time dependent current flowing through the system .",
    "since the set contains more than one tunnel junction , the time - dependent current which flows is not simply the tunnel current across either one of the junctions.@xcite when an electron tunnels through either junction , charge also flows in the external circuit connected to the set island ( so that the charge stored in each capacitor returns to its equilibrium value ) and hence also contributes to the current .",
    "the current flowing through the set can be measured in either the left or right - hand lead and the average current flowing through the leads must necessarily be the same .",
    "the time dependent current through the gated set is , in principle , slightly different in the left and right - hand leads , even for the symmetrical case we consider here where the tunnel - junction capacitances , @xmath0 , are the same.@xcite the time dependent current through the left - hand lead can be written@xcite @xmath38 whilst the time dependent current through the right - hand lead is given by@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the tunnel currents through the @xmath27 junctions respectively , and@xcite @xmath41 notice , however , that the two coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , add up to unity , whichever lead we consider . because of the dependence of these coefficients on the gate capacitance , @xmath3 , there will necessarily be a weak dependence of the coefficients on the position of the resonator",
    ". however , even the leading order position dependent term in the coefficients will be smaller by a factor @xmath45 than those arising within the expressions for the time dependent currents .",
    "since we are treating the case where @xmath46 , the corrections generated by the position dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , will be neglected here.@xcite in fact , it turns out that the noise spectrum is relatively insensitive to the exact values of the coefficients , and hence which lead the current is measured in .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we will not distinguish between the two leads in what follows and set @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the current fluctuations in the set are constrained by the conservation of charge .",
    "charge conservation implies that the charge that has tunnelled through the left - hand junction in time @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the charge that has tunnelled through the right junction in the same period , @xmath51 must be connected by the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the charge dwelling on the island between the two barriers at time @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , since the average tunnel currents through the left- and right - hand junctions are the same , they are both also equal to the average current through the set,@xcite @xmath54 and hence we also have , @xmath55 .",
    "the spectrum of current noise in the set is given by the fourier transform of the current - current correlation function,@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 the current - current correlation function , @xmath58 , is taken to be independent of @xmath49 .",
    "the noise in the total current is a combination of the noise in the tunnel currents through the left and right - hand junctions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively , and the charge noise of the set island @xmath61 . using the expression for the full current in terms of tunnel currents through the two junctions and the charge conservation relation , we can write the current noise spectrum as a sum of the three terms:@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 \\\\ s_{i_ri_r}(\\omega)&= & 2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\tau \\cos(\\omega \\tau)\\left[\\langle \\dot{q}_r(t+\\tau)\\dot{q}_r(t)\\rangle-\\langle \\dot{q}_r ( t)\\rangle^2\\right]\\\\ \\omega^{2}s_{q}(\\omega)&=&2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\tau \\cos(\\omega \\tau)\\langle \\dot{q}_d(t+\\tau)\\dot{q}_d(t)\\rangle . \\label{sqeqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last equation , the set island charge noise , @xmath64 , is identified with the noise in @xmath65 ( this connection",
    "will be derived in sec .",
    "notice that the charge noise acts to reduce the full noise spectrum , compared to the individual tunnel current noise spectra , reflecting the well - known fact that current noise is suppressed in double barrier structures.@xcite    the zero - frequency noise of the tunnel currents through the two junctions are equal , because of charge conservation , and hence @xmath66 .",
    "however , in order to obtain the full current noise at finite frequency we must calculate each of its three components .",
    "the noise in the tunnel currents @xmath59 and @xmath60 are obtained first , using an equation of motion method , then the charge noise , @xmath61 is calculated using a similar approach .",
    "the three elements of the current noise are then combined to obtain the full spectrum .",
    "the noise in the tunnel current across the set junctions can be calculated using an approach due to macdonald@xcite which relies on the fact that the number of charges that have passed across the junction as a function of time can be counted .",
    "for the set - resonator system , the description in terms of a probability distribution is easily extended to record the number of electrons passing across one or other of the tunnel barriers linking the set island to the leads .",

    "we can understand these features in terms of non - trivial correlations between the variables @xmath5 and @xmath74 . from the spectrum @xmath111 , we see that the @xmath74 term has a component oscillating at frequency @xmath118 and since @xmath5 will also oscillate at the same frequency , it is not surprising that the combination of the two dynamical variables in the term @xmath93 gives rise to a component oscillating at @xmath119 as well as at @xmath118 .",
    "the explicit dependence on @xmath5 in @xmath113 also makes the features in @xmath110 more sensitive to the magnitude of @xmath31 than those in @xmath111 .",

    "the enhancement of the low frequency noise is to be expected because of the effective correlations between successive electrons induced by the interactions with the resonator .",
    "it is known from other contexts@xcite that zero - frequency noise can be increased when an electron tunnelling event is able to change the internal state of a mesoscopic system ( such as a quantum dot ) . in this case ,",
    "an electron passing through the set alters the state of the resonator , which in turn alters the tunnelling rates for subsequent electrons .",
    "however , any excitation of the resonator is damped out over time and hence the zero - frequency peak in the spectrum follows a very similar pattern to the other peaks : it increases with the coupling strength , @xmath100 , but reduces with increasing damping , @xmath31 .",
    "it is the approximation of the gate capacitance by the linear form , @xmath122 , which means that there are no further peaks in the current noise beyond that at @xmath105 .",
    "if higher order terms had been included in the expression for the gate capacitance then they would have lead to higher order terms in the position dependence of the tunnel rates , which we would expect to generate peaks at higher multiples of the resonator frequency .",
    "however , within the regime we consider here , where @xmath123 , the additional peaks at higher frequency would be much smaller than those at @xmath104 and @xmath124 .",
    "the effects of extrinsic damping and finite background temperature on the tunnel current noise spectrum are illustrated in fig.[fig : cndamp ] , with the appropriate noise spectrum for the uncoupled system shown for comparison .",
    "it is clear that a non - zero value of @xmath13 rounds down each of the peaks at @xmath125 and 2 .",
    "furthermore , the peaks at @xmath104 and @xmath124 are also shifted to slightly lower frequencies , reflecting the fact that the extrinsic damping causes an extra reduction in the resonator frequency ( beyond that due to the interaction with the electrons ) .",
    "the influence of extrinsic damping gradually fades at higher frequencies where the spectrum is hardly affected by the resonator anyway .",
    "a non - zero background temperature counteracts the damping , increasing the height and broadening the peaks .",
    "the comparison with the uncoupled case in fig .  [ fig : cndamp ] , also reveals a small suppression of the noise just after the peak at @xmath104 , and a similar feature after the peak at @xmath105 .",
    "we can understand the presence of this suppression in a loose way by considering the actual motion of the resonator as a competition between two components .",
    "firstly , we can consider a resonator coupled to a thermal bath , in this case the mechanical motion would fluctuate strongly leading to an enhancement of the noise at the mechanical frequency.@xcite of course these thermal - like fluctuations arise already from the interaction between the resonator and the electrons,@xcite and are increased by the presence of an extrinsic bath .",
    "however , it seems likely that the interaction between the electrons and the resonator must also induce some coordination between the electronic and mechanical motion which would tend to make the current flow more regular and hence suppress the noise , at least at the resonator frequency . as we would expect from this simple picture , fig .",
    "[ fig : cndamp]b shows that increasing the background temperature rapidly washes out the regions of noise suppression .",

    "in fact , the magnitudes of the peaks in the left and right - hand tunnel noise spectra at @xmath129 differ by up to a few percent for the parameters used here .",

    "apart from the contributions due to the tunnel currents across the two set junctions , the full current - noise spectrum also contains a contribution arising from fluctuations in the charge stored on the set island , @xmath130 the average charge on the set island is a constant ( i.e.  @xmath131 ) , thus we can use macdonald s formula to show explicitly that this term is indeed the charge noise spectrum , @xmath132,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an integration by parts has been performed .    within our model of the set , the excess charge can only be either zero or one electron , hence @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath134 is simply the average occupancy of the set island multiplied by the electronic charge , @xmath135 , we can use the master equations to write down a closed set of coupled equations that link the average excess charge , position , @xmath136 , and velocity , @xmath137 , of the resonator , @xmath138 note that these equations are equivalent to the mean - coordinate equations derived in ref .  .",
    "since the equations of motion for the probability distribution are markovian , the equations of motion for two - time correlation functions of the charge can be obtained from the equations for the average quantities [ eqs .",
    "( [ mf1]-[mf3 ] ) ] using the regression theorem.@xcite thus we obtain , @xmath139 the initial conditions ( at @xmath94 ) are given by the steady state properties of the system .",
    "the charge noise spectrum is then obtained by integrating the coupled equations to obtain @xmath140 , and then performing the necessary fourier integral .    the frequency scaled spectrum , @xmath141 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qnoise ] for a range of resonator couplings and frequencies .",
    "the charge noise spectrum of the set island , like the function @xmath111 considered earlier , contains only a single peak , at the renormalized resonator frequency .",
    "this is not surprising as the equations of motion from which @xmath64 is obtained [ eqs .",
    "( [ q1]-[q3 ] ) ] have a structure which is very similar to those which determine @xmath111 [ eqs.([one]-[three ] ) ] .",
    "figure [ fig : qnoise ] shows that the height of the @xmath104 peak in @xmath141 is almost independent of @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( provided @xmath100 and @xmath101 are much less than unity , and also non - zero ) , this is because the peak height in the charge noise itself is approximately determined by the ratio of the coupling to the intrinsic damping @xmath142.@xcite",
    "once the noise spectra of the tunnel currents and the charge on the island have been calculated , the full current - noise spectrum is readily obtained by combining its components in the appropriate way [ as given by eq .",
    "( [ abeq ] ) ] .",
    "figure [ fig : full ] shows the full current - noise spectrum for the particular choice of the parameters @xmath143 .",
    "the overall spectrum is dominated by peaks at @xmath125 and @xmath124 , and largely flat elsewhere .",
    "the peak in the charge noise spectrum suppresses the peak in the tunnel noise spectra at @xmath104 , so that the peak at @xmath105 can become larger in the overall spectrum . for a combination of sufficiently strong coupling and weak damping , the zero - frequency noise exceeds the poissonian value @xmath106 .    in the limit where @xmath100 goes to zero",
    ", the full current noise spectrum is readily obtained analytically . in this limit",
    "the left and right - hand junction current noise spectra are the same , and the full current noise ( spectrum assuming @xmath143 ) is @xmath144 , \\label{comparison}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 .",
    "this is of course the usual result for sequential tunnelling through a symmetric double - barrier structure.@xcite thus in strong contrast to the coupled system , the current noise of the uncoupled , symmetric ( @xmath146 ) , set would be flat : @xmath147 .",
    "figure [ fig : full ] shows in detail the dependence of the spectrum on the resonator coupling , @xmath100 and intrinsic damping @xmath107 . once the frequency of the spectra is scaled by the renormalized frequency , a relatively simple behavior emerges . increasing the coupling strength increases the height and widths of the peaks , whilst increasing @xmath31 ( for fixed coupling ) simply rounds the peaks down without affecting their widths .",
    "although the heights of the peaks at @xmath104 and 2 scale with coupling in a very similar way in the individual tunnel current spectra ( see fig.[fig : cnoise1 ] ) , the relative magnitudes of the peaks at @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the full spectrum are very sensitive to the magnitude of @xmath100 .",
    "this is because the peak in the frequency - scaled charge noise @xmath141 is almost completely insensitive to changes in @xmath100 and hence gives rise to a proportionately stronger suppression of the @xmath104 peak for smaller @xmath100 values .    for the relatively low frequencies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] , the noise is higher than the uncoupled value , even away from the immediate vicinity of the peaks .",
    "this increase in the background noise level depends on @xmath100 , but not @xmath101 , and occurs because the resonator breaks the symmetry of the tunnel rates through the two junctions . only for the uncoupled system do the physical tunnel rates correspond to the parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149 . when the coupling to the resonator is switched on , the tunnel rates for both junctions depend linearly on the position of the resonator , but with opposite sign , and the strength of this coupling is given by @xmath100 .",
    "the coupling to the resonator can thus be thought of as giving rise to an effective renormalization of the tunnel rates and since the noise is a minimum for the symmetric tunnel rates of the uncoupled system , @xmath150 ( which we choose here ) , the coupling always gives rise to an increased background noise level .",
    "although it is not shown in the figures , the current noise reduces to the uncoupled value at large frequencies , @xmath151 , since any asymmetry in the junction tunnel rates becomes unimportant at large frequencies .",
    "the influence of extrinsic effects on the current noise spectrum are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : full2 ] . as with the tunnel current spectra ,",
    "extrinsic damping reduces the peak heights and the background noise level , whilst increasing the background temperature has the opposite effect .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that extrinsic effects can alter the relative heights of the peaks at @xmath104 and @xmath124 .",
    "the full noise spectrum could equally well be calculated for a variety of cases where @xmath152 , reflecting the balance of capacitances in the system more accurately , as discussed in sec.ii .",
    "however , now that we have obtained the individual spectra of the noise in the tunnel currents and the charge noise , it is clear that for small changes of the coefficients about the values @xmath153 , there would be no qualitative change in the overall current spectrum and so we have not investigated such cases explicitly .",
    "the presence of a voltage - gate consisting of a nanomechanical resonator has a dramatic effect on the current - noise spectrum of the set .",
    "the low frequency noise of the set can be substantially enhanced and two additional peaks appear in the noise spectrum : at the frequency of the resonator ( renormalized by the interaction with the set ) and at twice that frequency . without extrinsic damping and with the background temperature set to zero , the peaks in the current noise are sharp , with heights controlled by the the strength of the resonator - set coupling and the magnitude of the intrinsic damping constant .",
    "the features in the current - noise spectrum reflect the fact that the coupled dynamics of the set and the resonator lead to important correlations between charges flowing through the set and the position of the resonator . in particular , the interaction between the resonator and the electrons on the set island provide a mechanism by which the passage of one electron through the system can affect the motion of subsequent electrons .",
    "hence it is not surprising that the noise in the measured current does not conform to any simple picture based on a combination of the usual noise spectrum of the set and the mechanical noise spectrum of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the calculation presented here is for the particular case of a classical resonator coupled to a set as a voltage gate . very recently a number of other authors have considered aspects of the current noise in a similar nanoelectromechanical system known as the electron shuttle,@xcite in both the classical@xcite and quantum regimes.@xcite in particular , the current noise spectrum of a classical shuttle system obtained by isacsson and nord@xcite shows peaks at the frequency of the mechanical system and its first harmonic in close correspondence with the spectrum of the set - resonator system described here .",
