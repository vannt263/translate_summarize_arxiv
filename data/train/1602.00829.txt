    "the current understanding of the mechanism behind the dramatic slowing down of supercooled liquids near the glass transition temperatures still remains far from complete .",
    "although underlying mechanism of the glass transition is believed to be universal , many dynamical properties of the glass formers are diverse and system - dependent . among them , the concept of the fragility , or the temperature dependence of the relaxation time and transport coefficients such as the viscosity and diffusion constant , is one of the most important but the least understood problems . for some glass formers , which are called the",
    "_ strong _ liquids according to the angell s classification , the relaxation times obey the arrhenius law , while others , called the _ fragile _ liquids , show a strong departure from the arrhenius law in their temperature dependence of the relaxation times  @xcite .",
    "representative strong glass formers are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , whose local molecular configurations are characterized by anisotropic network structures . on the other hand ,",
    "the fragile liquids such as @xmath3-terphenyl and toluene tend to have more isotropic and compact local structures .",
    "the concept of the fragility has been playing a key role in the study of the glass transition .",
    "many experimental studies have reported that there exist correlations between the fragility and various thermodynamic , structural , mechanical , and dynamical properties of the glass formers  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been observed that the entropy and specific heat  @xcite , the elastic constants  @xcite , and the spatially heterogeneous dynamics  @xcite sensitively depend on the fragility of the systems .",
    "theoretical understanding of the fragility , on the other hand , is left at the phenomenological level .",
    "virtually all theoretical scenarios of the glass transition proposed so far , including the adam - gibbs theory@xcite , the random first order transition theory  @xcite , energy landscape picture  @xcite , geometric frustration scenarios  @xcite , elastic models  @xcite , soft modes  @xcite , and the dynamic facilitation scenario  @xcite , have their own explanations of the fragility but the first - principles and microscopic theory to quantitatively describe the fragility is still lacking  @xcite .",
    "difficulty to gain an unified picture of the fragility out of the experimental observations is obviously due to the diversity and complexity of real molecular or polymeric glass formers .",
    "the computer simulation is an ideal tool to avoid this difficulty because one can gain all microscopic information of dynamics for relatively simple model systems .",
    "popular glass former models in the simulation studies , such as the soft - sphere ( ss )  @xcite and the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential liquids  @xcite , are regarded as typical fragile glass formers . on the other hand ,",
    "strong glass former models with anisotropic networks , where the particles are connected by covalent bonds , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , have also been studied extensively by simulations  @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to understand the origin of the fragility systematically by simulations . in many studies ,",
    "the isotropic potential systems such as the ss and lj potentials have been employed .",
    "the fragility has been controlled using various methods , for example , by varying the density or pressure of the system  @xcite , by changing the polydispersity  @xcite and the size ratio of the multi - component mixtures  @xcite , by tuning the interaction potential  @xcite , or by truncating the attractive part of the lj potential  @xcite .",
    "the fragility was also found to be sensitive to many - body interactions which influence the local geometrical frustration  @xcite .",
    "an idea to sort out thermodynamic and purely kinetic contributions to the fragility has been discussed recently  @xcite .",
    "the external parameters such as the impurities  @xcite and the curvature of the non - euclidean space  @xcite have been proposed as a new method to control the fragility .",
    "the findings of these studies , however , are still not sufficient to unravel the entire picture of the fragility . aside from the obvious drawback that the time window which the current simulation can cover is narrow compared with experiments ,",
    "the one of the obstacles of computational studies is that the variation of the fragility which the simple glass former models can encompass is small  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the variation of the fragility is often masked by an apparent density - temperature scaling law , which makes it difficult to extract the generic mechanism controlling the fragility  @xcite .",
    "there also remains the nagging question of how to decompose the kinetic and purely thermodynamic contributions of the fragility  @xcite .",
    "even more important is to bridge the gap between the fragile isotropic systems and the strong network glass formers , which has been studied almost in different arenas in the past . given these circumstances , it is beneficial to consider a simple model system which can cover a wide range of fragility , spanning from the strongest network glass former down to the very fragile isotropic system , simply by tuning a system parameter .    in this paper , we numerically study a simple model glass former originally introduced by coslovich and pastore ( cp ) as a model strong glass former mimicking @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the cp model is a binary mixture of spherical atoms interacting by the isotropic lennard - jones potential with a very strong attraction between si and o atoms , which allows them to form anisotropic tetrahedral network structures . in this study ,",
    "the fragility of the cp model is examined over an extremely wide range of density from the order of unity up to virtually infinity .",
    "varying the density is equivalent with changing the potential depth between si and o atoms of the cp model . by reducing this potential depth ( or increasing the density )",
    ", the anisotropic tetrahedral network structure observed in the cp model is eventually transformed into the isotropic structure with the purely repulsive soft - sphere potential .",
    "thus , it enables one to control the fragility from strong to fragile systematically .    here , we summarize the results of this paper . by extensive simulations , dependence of the structure on the density",
    "is monitored using the radial distribution functions , the static structure factors , and the coordination numbers . by measuring the temperature dependence of the relaxation time obtained from the density - density time correlation function , we observe that the fragility systematically changes from strong to fragile with the change of the structures .",
    "we carefully examine the density - temperature scaling for the temperature dependence of the relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "it is confirmed that the relaxation time does not collapse onto a master curve .",
    "this implies that the observed fragility variation is not superficial but it is due to a qualitative change of the underlying mechanism controlling the slow dynamics .",
    "we investigate correlation between the fragility and several dynamical observables , _",
    "i.e. _ , the magnitude of the stokes - einstein ( se ) violation and the exponent of the stretched exponential relaxation of the density correlation function .",
    "it has been argued that these observables are manifestations of spatially heterogeneous dynamics , or _",
    "the dynamical heterogeneities _ , and they are intimately correlated to the fragility  @xcite . we confirm that more fragile systems show stronger se violation , whereas a clear - cut correlation between the stretch exponent and the fragility is not observed .",
    "finally , we also discuss the possibility that the fragility is related to the peak position of the specific heat observed in its temperature dependence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : simulation_methods ] , we describe the details of the simulation methods . the numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "our model can seamlessly connect the original cp model to the purely repulsive ss potential model . as mentioned above",

    "it has been argued that this fs crossover is related with a thermodynamic anomaly signaled by appearance of the peak of the specific heat  @xcite which tends to shift to lower temperatures if the density is increased  @xcite .",
    "this anomaly might be connected to a hidden thermodynamic singularity such as the liquid - liquid transition .",
    "but the overall picture is still unclear . under these circumstances , it is of great interest to examine whether the fs crossover and the shift of the specific heat are also observed in the cp model by tuning the potential depth @xmath31 .",
    "the specific heat is calculated by @xmath184 .",
    "figure  [ fig : specific_heat ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath185 for various potential depth @xmath31 .",
    "the temperature @xmath104 is normalized by the onset temperature @xmath134 .",
    "as observed , there exists the broad but clear peak of @xmath185 at a finite temperature @xmath140 for all @xmath31 s except for @xmath105 .",
    "we can not access the lower temperatures for @xmath186 because the system crystallizes .",

    "we find that @xmath140 shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing @xmath31 ( increasing the density ) .",

    "one hardly observe any sort of distinct crossover . in this figure",
    ", we marked the temperatures at which the peak of the specific heat are observed with the empty symbols for the guide of eyes . for the data of @xmath187 and 6 , it is not impossible to fit the data of @xmath175 with the arrhenius and super - arrhenius laws on the low and high temperature sides across @xmath188 , but the fitting range is too narrow to call it convincing .",
    "similar fitting was also possible for smaller values of @xmath31 s , but it is less trustworthy .",
    "therefore , it would be fair to say that the existence of the correlation between the fs crossover and the peak of the specific heat is not conclusive in current numerical simulations  @xcite .",

    "this approach has enabled us to perform simulations over a wide range of density from the order of unity up to infinity . from the radial distribution functions , the coordination numbers , and the static structure factors",
    ", we found that the anisotropic tetrahedral network structures are broken and then the isotropic structures are formed by decreasing @xmath31 ( or increasing the density ) .",
    "we have also calculated various dynamical quantities such as the relaxation time and diffusion constant .",
    "these calculations have revealed that their temperature dependence seamlessly changes from the arrhenius to the super - arrhenius behavior .",
    "we also confirmed that the temperature dependence of the dynamics is not collapsed by the dt scaling , assuring that the observed fragility change is not a consequence of the trivial density scaling but due to the generic change of the mechanism of the glassy dynamics . we have studied the relationship between the fragility and two dynamical quantities , the magnitude of the se violation and the stretch exponent of the density correlation function .",
    "the magnitude of the se violation , which is believed to be a manifestation of the dynamical heterogeneities , correlates well with the fragility of the cp model . on the contrary ,",
    "the clear correlation between the fragility and the stretch exponent has not been observed . finally , the peak of the specific heat and the possible correlation with the fragile - to - strong ( fs ) crossover have been argued .",
    "the peak has been observed in the temperature dependence of the specific heat for most @xmath31 s in the cp model .",
    "in addition , its peak position shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing the potential depth @xmath31 ( or increasing the density ) .",
    "these observations are related with the recent numerical results obtained in the bks model  @xcite .",
    "however , it was difficult to identify the fs crossover temperature from the relaxation times because the simulation time windows are too narrow and we conclude that the correlation between the fs crossover and thermodynamic anomaly is still elusive . further numerical investigation is required .",
    "we address that the cp model exhibits a very broad variation of the fragility , the highest and lowest values of which are comparable to those of the most fragile and strongest liquids studied numerically in the past , and that it can serve as an ideal bench for numerical study of the fragility .",
    "note that the harmonic sphere model also shows a very wide variation of the fragility as the density is varied  @xcite .",
    "this model also does not satisfy the dt scaling .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this model is qualitatively different from the cp model . in the harmonic sphere model",
    ", the potential is truncated at a certain cutoff distance . at low densities ,",
    "the model becomes effectively a hard sphere system .",
    "therefore , the temperature and energy are not relevant but , instead , the pressure or density become the controlling thermodynamic parameters .",
    "this means that at low densities the temperature dependence of the relaxation time is trivially arrhenius , whereas at higher densities , the temperature plays a pivotal role , leading to more diverging ( or fragile ) behavior . for the cp model , on the contrary , the temperature plays a role as a relevant control parameter for all densities and the fragility is continuously controlled .",
    "there are other physical quantities that are expected to be related with the fragility  @xcite ; the excess entropy  @xcite , the elastic constants  @xcite , the non - ergodicity parameter  @xcite , the boson peak frequency  @xcite , and the temperature dependence of microscopic structure  @xcite .",
