    "based on these results , the disorder of the ethylene end groups must affect the electrical characteristics at high magnetic fields .",
    "the simt appearing in the fast cooling experiment is regarded to have primarily originates from the disorder effect on the appropriate condition of the degree of deuteration and the inhomogenity contained in the sample itself .",
    "in conclusion , the infrared reflectivity spectra and the spatial image of the center of the spectral weight of 50  % -deuterated @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br were measured as functions of magnetic field and cooling rate at 5  k. under fast cooling conditions , the material exhibited a phase coexistence of the metallic ( or superconducting ) and insulating states on the sample surface in spite of the almost metallic phase in the slow cooling condition .",
    "parts of the superconducting state change to the insulating state at 5  t and to the metallic state at 10  t. the superconductor  insulator  metal transition is concluded to primarily originate from the disorder effect of the ethylene end groups of the bedt - ttf molecules combined with the degree of deuteration and the inhomogenity contained in the sample itself .",
