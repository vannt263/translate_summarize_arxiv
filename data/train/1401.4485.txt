    "the complexity of glass forming systems is most apparent in the unusual nonexponential relaxation dynamics found both in the supercooled fluid and in the glassy state . after",
    "a supercooled liquid falls out of equilibrium on cooling the resulting glass initially can be thought of as frozen snapshot of the liquid state just before it fell out - of - equilibrium.@xcite thus initially there is no long - range spatial order .",
    "since the glass is out - of - equilibrium , however , it continues to evolve , albeit slowly , as the system ages and new but subtle spatial structure emerges . on experimental timescales ergodicity",
    "is broken below the glass transition so time averages no longer equal full - ensemble averages .",
    "furthermore , properties in the glass vary from region to region and the sensitivity of activation barrier heights to local properties leads to very strongly heterogeneous dynamics . in this article we explore the inhomogeneous dynamical structure formed within the glassy state using a framework based on the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory.@xcite    the random first order transition theory of glass has already provided a unified quantitative description of many aspects of supercooled liquids and structural glasses.@xcite the theory has its origins in bringing together two seemingly distinct mean field theories of glass formation , one being the dynamical , ideal mode coupling theory,@xcite the other being a thermodynamic theory of freezing into aperiodic structures.@xcite a variety of mean - field like approximations most elegantly formulated via the replica approach deal with the self - generated long - lived randomness in structural glasses.@xcite within mean field theories there is a special temperature @xmath2 , below which an exponentially large number of frozen states emerge.@xcite it was however easy to see via droplet arguments that beyond the pure mean - field description which gives infinite long lived metastable stats that such many metastable states will be destroyed by locally activated transitions if they are exponentially large in number.@xcite when ergodicity is restored thereby , in finite dimensions , the dynamical transition at @xmath2 is smeared out . nevertheless at a lower temperature @xmath3 where the configurational entropy of the mean field states would appear to vanish",
    ", this argument suggests a true thermodynamic transition could finally appear.@xcite thermally activated motions would cease at such a thermodynamic transition if the entropy crisis occurs rather than being intercepted by some other mechanism .",
    "eastwood and wolynes have presented an argument that suggests while the droplets themselves could provide such a mechanism of cutting off a transition , on normal time scales , the droplet entropy correction is quantitatively unimportant.@xcite droplets provide the key feature of rfot theory , an activated mechanism of mobility generation .",
    "nevertheless , because of its shared origin with mode coupling theory , rfot theory allows mobility once generated below @xmath2 to be transported giving a microscopic basis for the notion of facilitation.@xcite facilitation , in its simplest incarnation , can be thought of as defect diffusion , which in low dimensional systems by itself can lead to nonexponentiality.@xcite in the quantitative analysis of non exponential relaxation using the rfot theory the mobility transport effect was shown to be an essential feature that diminishes the effects of the instantaneous heterogeneity in activation barriers which otherwise would lead to a broader distribution of relaxation times than observed.@xcite    the entropy driven activated events in rfot theory allow one to connect a broad range of experimental measurements on dynamics in glasses with their thermodynamics .",
    "examples included the predictions of the fragility index @xmath4,@xcite the fragility parameter @xmath5,@xcite the stretching exponent in the supercooled liquid @xmath0,@xcite the correlation length@xcite and the yield strength.@xcite all these predictions require only thermodynamic data as input , while they are all decidedly kinetic observables .    aside from questions about underlying mechanism",
    "even the phenomenological description of dynamics in the glassy state is nontrivial .",
    "the nonergodic behavior in the glassy state implies that measured properties not only depend on time but also are dependent in detail on the sample s history of preparation .",
    "the need to describe experimental protocols makes even communicating experimental results a challenge let alone predicting results theoretically.@xcite the fictive temperature concept was introduced as a single additional number globally characterizing the instantaneously non equilibrium state of the glass in the phenomenological description of narayanaswamy , moynihan and tool ( nmt ) .",
    "this is not enough .",
    "lubchenko and wolynes have , however , argued within the rfot framework that every patch of glass can be described as having a fictive temperature locally.@xcite in this framework extending the local fictive temperature concept to describe the global level requires dynamically coupling regions together i.e. it requires combining the mobility generation mechanism that acts locally in rfot with mode coupling that transports mobility .",
    "bhattacharyya , bagchi , and wolynes ( bbw)@xcite have shown to how combine these by including an activated event vertex into the standard mct vertex .",
    "the spatial variations in activated dynamics were not made explicit in their calculations .",
    "the theory has been extended to obtain a field theory that takes into account of spatiotemporal structure of dynamics in supercooled liquids and glasses by expanding the mode coupling memory kernels using a taylor series in terms of its gradients thus defining a mobility field @xmath6 having explicit space and time dependence.@xcite this expansion yields a continuum equation for the mobility field in which mobility can be both generated from activated events or transported from highly mobile regions to less mobile areas through mode coupling facilitation effects . to account for the random nature of mobility generation and transport",
    "the equations for the mobility field also contain generation and transport noises .",
    "we have already used these equations to describe the front like transformation of stable glass into supercooled liquids discovered by ediger _ et .",
    "al_.@xcite the numerical solutions of the continuum equations predict the transformation front speed in quantitative agreement with the experiments.@xcite    while our previous work detailed the spatiotemporal character of the transformation of stable glasses into equilibrium liquids where the mean mobility differs by many orders of magnitude across the sample , even dynamics in the bulk glass alone exhibits heterogeneity in both space and time.@xcite this heterogeneity is an intrinsic characteristic in all glassy systems and is evident in non - exponential relaxation.@xcite the rfot theory has already explained quantitatively the dynamical heterogeneity in equilibrated suprecooled liquids .",
    "using rfot theory , xia and wolynes argued that due to facilitation the free energy barriers will not be gaussian distributed , but will have a distribution with significant skewness.@xcite they showed that the non - exponential parameter depends on width of the distribution of the free energy through a static stretching exponent @xmath7 . here",
    "we will show that the continuum equations of a fluctuating mobility field and fluctuating fictive temperature which have been derived describes more completely the dynamical heterogeneity and directly leads to a distribution of the free energy having a long tail on the low energy barrier side as xia and wolynes suggested . by following the complete evolution of the mobility field , calculations of the four - point correlation function in the glassy state",
    "prove possible.@xcite    dynamical heterogeneity in space and time results in non - trivial out - of - equilibrium signatures in calorimetric experiments which are hysteretic and not symmetric between what happens when glasses are cooled down or are heated up . as explained earlier,@xcite upon cooling , some previously high mobility regions will rapidly equilibrate to a low fictive temperature near that of the ambient temperature , while other regions , initially more stable , will maintain their higher initial fictive temperature.@xcite since the prematurely equilibrated regions now have a low mobility one should find in the partially aged glass a bimodal rate distribution .",
    "mobility transport to the low fictive temperature regions also slows approach to equilibrium in their neighborhoods .",
    "in contrast , upon heating , the glasses after the first reconfiguration events , regions near to the first reconfigurating regions equilibrate faster than they would have in the original equilibrated sample .",
    "the initially reconfigured regions of high mobility now catalyze the rearrangement of their low - mobility neighbors leading to a radially propagating front of mobility .",
    "the numerical solution of the continuum equations of mobility field and the fictive temperature that we are going to present in the next section quantitatively captures these predicted phenomena .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide a more explicit derivation of the continuum equations for the mobility field driven by activated events with mobility fluctuations than was given before .",
    "we then explore the inhomogeneous dynamical structure of the glass in section iii where we analyze the free - energy distribution , the four - point correlation function , and the stretching exponent for @xmath8-relaxation . in section iv",
    ", we use the equations to model calorimetric experiments on several glasses and compare predictions with experimental data . in section",
    "v , we investigate the kinetics of long - aged glasses and show that the bimodal dynamic heterogeneity which emerges will appear in the laboratory as `` ultraslow '' relaxations like those experimentally observed@xcite and recently highlighted.@xcite section iv summarizes our study and discusses possible extensions of this work .",
    "in the following we describe in some detail the microscopic basis of the continuum equations of mobility field with fluctuating generation and transport described earlier by one of us.@xcite these equations were previously studied numerically by us@xcite in the context of mobility front propagation in which an ultrastable glass prepared by vapor deposition `` melts '' into an equilibrated liquid from the free surfaces which are predicted by rfot theory to have higher mobility than the bulk .",
    "rfot theory near an interface predicts @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the microscopic time , @xmath11 is the relaxation in the three dimensional bulk and @xmath12 is the relaxation time of the surface layer.@xcite    in the equilibrium supercooled liquid , particles spend relatively brief times near each other , collide and then move freely and go on further to collide with others in a weakly correlated way .",
    "as the temperature decreases or the density increases further , groups of correlated collisions between particles in the same spatial region occur more and more frequently .",
    "persistent structures therefore emerge .",
    "individual particles continue to move and vibrate , but now reside within a nearly fixed cage . once in awhile",
    ", particles nevertheless manage to move from one cage to another through activated processes which are actually many particle events . thus confined motion followed by hops",
    "becomes the dominant dynamical feature at temperatures below @xmath2 .",
    "extending mode coupling theory through more elaborate perturbative expansions that only keep track of a finite number of correlated collisions will miss the activated process which is an essential singularity in the temperature ( and therefore fluctuation strength ) expansion .",
    "this is why any simple perturbation extension at finite order in mct or in static replica methods is problematic , at best .",
    "this formal difficulty exists also in the theory of ordinary first order transitions@xcite and in the quantum chromodynamics of the nucleon.@xcite    the standard mode - coupling theory gives an equation of motion for the system average correlation function that decays from a constant value to zero in the long time limit above the dynamical transition temperature .",
    "the decay of the correlations depends on the history of the system in the past .",
    "the nature of the decay is mathematically encoded in the memory kernel.@xcite this kernel can be expanded perturbatively in terms of higher order correlation functions , but can be approximated self - consistently as products of two - point correlation functions.@xcite the resummed perturbative mode coupling theory works perfectly well at temperatures , above @xmath2,@xcite but the theory breaks down at the temperature below @xmath2 as it shows an infinite plateau in the two - point correlation function,@xcite which is not allowed in finite dimension above @xmath3 , i.e. the cages are permanent in mode coupling theory . instead of complete freezing",
    "the system actually goes from collision dominated transport to transport driven by activated processes as it crosses the dynamical temperature @xmath2.@xcite    being essential singularities the activated dynamics must be incorporated into the mct directly . as shown by bbw,@xcite activated processes give an extra decay channel for the correlation function .",
    "when the activated events are included , the memory kernel consists of two distinct contributions one coming from idealized mct kernel @xmath13 and one described by an additional hopping kernel @xmath14 @xmath15 the mode coupling memory kernel has a complicated structure involving coupling to density fluctuation modes with other wave vectors , but it is dominated by density modes with wave vector @xmath16 near the value corresponding to the first peak of the structure factor , since fourier density modes of the wavelength decay the slowest due to de gennes narrowing.@xcite this simplification leads to the so - called schematic mode coupling theory .    a mobility field can be defined as the longtime rate at which particles reconfigure through activated dynamics .",
    "this field can thus be formulated in real space as a fourier transform in space of that memory kernel and is an integral of that kernel over elapsed time @xmath17 . @xmath18",
    "the total mobility field will contain two components one from the activated dynamics and one from the idealized mct part @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 we assume that the part of the mobility coming from hopping dynamics @xmath22 instantaneously re - adjusts to depend on the local fictive temperature @xmath23 and the ambient temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the mct memory kernel is determined by the full dynamic density correlation function @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the usual vertex function in the standard mct .",
    "ultimately the mobility field differs from one region to another because the local mobility has inherited local fluctuating structure from the liquid state .",
    "particles residing in the cage also have different activated relaxation times depending on the local fictive temperature which itself varies in space and time .",
    "these effects both lead to the mobility being inhomogeneous in space and time . in the approximation that these quantities do not change too rapidly from one place to neighboring regions",
    ", we can expand the mobility field in a taylor s series around @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "doing this leads to an equation of motion for @xmath30 . to see this , note the correlation function @xmath31 itself depends on the memory kernel which again varies in space and time because mobility does .",
    "now if we expand @xmath32 about @xmath33 we find that    @xmath34    where @xmath35 .",
    "now we can expand @xmath36 and keep the lowest terms in the gradients .",
    "the gradient expansion of @xmath30 thus has the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is a locally equilibrated mobility field which we will discuss later .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is the ratio of the part of the mobility field coming from the activated events alone to the total mobility .",
    "this quantity depends on the local structure factors and has been computed for _ salol _ by bbw.@xcite for salol they find @xmath41 . for convenience we will assume in our numerics that this factor @xmath42 is the same for all glasses .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also given by integrals over the mct kernel .",
    "for example the coefficient @xmath45 can be written explicitly as @xmath46 ( t - t ' ) d(t - t'),\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the vertex function of standard mode - coupling theory.@xcite    notice if we approximate each term of @xmath48 by its long time behavior we can write @xmath49 , so then we obtain @xmath50 carrying out the integral , we then get a simple form for the coefficient @xmath51 . in the absence of spatial inhomogeneity ,",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath30 is @xmath52    now we examine the other gradient terms , within each term of the taylor series , a term of the type @xmath53 or @xmath54 is generated . in each term again using the exponential approximation for the local decay gives for the derivative @xmath55 .",
    "thus within this approximation one generates terms of the same form as in the mct kernel but now with extra powers of @xmath56 . upon integrating",
    "then one finds extra factors @xmath57 for a term containing @xmath58 . except for powers of @xmath59 one",
    "again gets the mode coupling kernel .",
    "thus a typical term will be @xmath60 . with the spatial variation ,",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath30 also has spatial gradient terms :    @xmath61    notice that a characteristic length @xmath62 naturally emerges from the ratio of the two integrations in the gradient term versus uniform mct : @xmath63 so the coefficient of the @xmath64 can be written as @xmath65 .",
    "thus we see that @xmath66 can be thought of as the mobility diffusion coefficient .",
    "since activated events are included in the kernels the @xmath62 obtained in this way will not precisely be equal to the correlation length of the pure mode coupling theory @xmath67 which was determined by reichman _",
    "al._,@xcite but it will be related to it sufficiently far from @xmath2 itself .    by taking the static limit we can see that the coefficient of the linear laplacian term contains a length @xmath62 which would be the correlation length of the 4-point correlation function consistent with an analysis by biroli _",
    "al.__@xcite the gradient squared term arises because of the nonlinear relation of the mct closure between the memory kernel and the correlation functions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath44 depend on the details of the microscopic mode coupling closures employed . for simplicity we will choose the value of @xmath44 so that the locally linearized equation can be written as a mobility flow equation with a source term @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "we believe that apart from this bulk source term any violation of the local `` conservation '' laws for mobility will be small and in any case one can see they would only modify the results in a modest quantitative fashion .",
    "the uniform solution of the extended mode coupling theory with activated events @xmath71 which is used for input can be approximated by using the ultralocal theoretical analysis of aging glasses by lubchenko and wolynes.@xcite they suggest activation will still be the dominant effect below @xmath2 so that the rates depend on the local fictive temperature @xmath72 and ambient temperature @xmath24 @xmath73 where @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 is the lindemann length and @xmath76 is the interparticle spacing .",

    "the fictive temperature approximately obeys an ultralocal relaxation law with the local decay rate @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78    in the bulk itself there are dynamic inhomogeneities from fluctuations in the local fictive temperature and from the happenstance nature of the activated events which generate and transport the mobility field .",
    "we treat the corresponding random force terms in the equation as coarse - grained white noises with strengths and correlation lengths that reflect the length scale of the activated events .",
    "the intensities of the noises may be found by requiring the linearized equations to satisfy locally fluctuation - dissipation relations . the local fictive temperature fluctuation @xmath79 is taken to be @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the number of molecular units in a cooperatively rearranging region . the fluctuations in mobility generation @xmath82 and transport",

    "both the equilibrated liquid and the nonequilibrium glass have intrinsically disordered structures .",
    "even if all particles are identical , in each system , individual particles experience different local environments at any given time . in the high temperature liquid , the disorder may be averaged over and the system described via uniform equilibrium .",
    "but , as the glass transition is approached , the structural relaxation time increases dramatically and the system takes a long time to relax and may find itself out - of - equilibrium.@xcite disorder in the glass seems to be static yet molecules are in motion and change their locations through activated dynamics.@xcite some particles may move large distances , while others remain localized near their original position .",
    "we may refer these behaviors as particles being `` mobile '' or `` immobile '' , and any given sites may be characterized by quantity describing themselves the so - called `` mobility.''@xcite experiments show that the mobility of particles in adjacent regions can vary by several orders of magnitude.@xcite    over the last decade , direct molecular dynamics simulations of supercooled liquids have given some insight into the nature of dynamic heterogeneity @xcite but it has been a challenge to go further into deeply low temperature region characteristic of laboratory experiments because of diverging relaxation time . here",
    "we can study realistic levels of supercooling by using the methods described in the previous section to simulate the heterogeneity of the glass starting from the mesoscopic equations for the mobility field .",
    "a snapshot of the mobility and the fictive temperature field of 1,3,5-tris(naphthyl)benzene ( tnb ) glass which has been equilibrated at @xmath87 k by solving the fluctuating field equations in two dimensions is shown in figure [ fig : mobilityfield1 ] .",

    "the mobility field varies throughout the space in a way that correlates with the local values of the fictive temperature .",
    "the high mobility regions ( low relaxation time ) are generally less stable than the regions with low mobility and are ready to reconfigure to lower energy state .",
    "the fictive temperature and the mobility are coupled in a non - linear fashion ; however , their values are consistent with each other in general .",
    "the low mobility regions generally map on to the low fictive temperature and vice versa . in equilibrium",
    "both fields fluctuate around their equilibrium values .    ]",
    "it is an important point to mention that the domains surrounding any region may reconfigure before that central region can move . when this happens local constraints on the slow region",
    "will be removed .",
    "this change of environment effect can be called `` facilitation . ''",
    "as xia and wolynes argued this effect means the static barrier height distribution coming from fictive temperature fluctuating will be cut off on the high barrier side .",
    "a simple cutoff distribution follows from the idea that it is primarily those domains slower than the most probable rate that would actually reconfigure only when their environmental neighbors have changed ; thus they actually will reconfigure at something close to the most probable rate , which has already been predicted by the rfot theory . the resulting cutoff distribution for activation barrier , as discussed by xia and wolynes,@xcite",
    "has a form @xmath88 the delta function is an exaggeration of the effect as pointed out by lubchenko who has provide a more elegant distribution.@xcite the free energy barrier found from the simulation does not contain a sharp delta function in eq .",

    "figure [ fig : energy distribution ] illustrates the free energy distribution from the simulation . like the xia - wolynes distribution@xcite and lubchenkos,@xcite the shape of the distribution is not symmetric and has a long tail to the low energy barrier side .",
    "this result reflects that the mobility can be transported from higher region to lower region through the facilitation effect .",
    "it should be noted that because of the arrhenius law the free energy barriers being even modestly distributed in space leads to the wide variation of the relaxation times .",
    "each domain relaxes independently with something close to a simple exponential decay function . by virtue of of the ensemble average done in most bulk experiments",

    "is a secondary effect .    ]",
    "as the supercooled liquid falls out of equilibrium , particles can be considered to form groups of cooperatively rearranging regions .",
    "this mosaic structure of the liquid gives rise to dynamical heterogeneity and the overall non exponential relaxation .",
    "the driving force for reequilibration varies from mosaic cell to cell .",
    "this leads to a wide range of activation barriers @xmath90 .",
    "computing these fluctuations allowed xia and wolynes to predict @xmath0 for a range of substances in the equilibrated liquid.@xcite their approach was extended to the aging regime by lubchenko and wolynes.@xcite    below the glass transition temperature @xmath1 , the local structure of the liquid is initially frozen at @xmath1 .",

    "however , in an aged sample where the system has already fallen out - of - equilibrium , this statistics have to be determined self - consistently by the dynamics of the system and by its detailed past thermal history.@xcite if the spatial structure is neglected , lubchenko and wolynes suggest this can be approximated by the nmt phenomenology .",

    "the aging glass becomes more stable and is more inhomogeneous in its energy distribution than it was initially when it first fell out of equilibrium.@xcite lubchenko and wolynes thus argued that rfot theory implies there would be additional heterogeneity to be found at intermediate times which would lead to additional ultraslow relaxations .",
