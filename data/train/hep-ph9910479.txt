    "we consider chiral quark models which encompass three sectors .",
    "the vacuum and soliton sectors , which are treated in the mean - field ( leading order in @xmath0 ) approximation , and the meson sector , which describes the ( next to leading order in @xmath0 ) vibrations of the vacuum sector .",
    "not all models are applicable to the three sectors . for example ,",
    "constituent quark models , in which quarks interact with confining forces , can not describe the vacuum sector , that is , the dirac sea .",
    "however , they can and do describe the excited states of baryons , a thing which the chiral quark models can not do ( except , possibly , the @xmath1 ) for lack of confinement .",
    "chiral quark models ( nor any of the other low energy quark models ) have not been derived from qcd .",
    "the only serious attempt to derive them from qcd  is the instanton gas model @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the chiral quark model is derived by calculating the propagation of quarks in a gas of instantons . a regularized effective theory results , as it should .",
    "it predicts both the value of the cut - off and the form of the regulator .",
    "the non - local regularization discussed here has the same form as the one derived from the instanton gas model .",
    "unfortunately , the quark models derived from the instanton structure of the vacuum do not lead to quark or color confinement .",
    "this serious limitation serves as a reminder that we have not really succeeded in deriving low energy effective theories from qcd .",
    "other so - called `` derivations '' of quark models from qcd involve more guesswork than derivation .",
    "most telling is their inability to derive a regularized model . if infinities appear in an effective theory , one should seek the physical processes which prevent the infinities from occurring . invoking the roughly @xmath2  mev",
    "qcd cut - off is not a serious argument . nor",
    "does qcd  imply in any sense that the quark - quark interaction at low energy should be a one - gluon exchange with a modified gluon propagator .",
    "the regularizations used so far in the nambu jona - lasinio type models for example ( proper - time regularization being the most commonly used one so far ) , are nothing but renormalization techniques in which a finite cut - off is maintained . not only is this arbitrary but such regularizations are flawed with problems .",
    "one might argue that the value of the cut - off should not matter .",
    "indeed it would not if the effective theory consisted , for example , in eliminating some high energy degrees of freedom and using the remaining degrees of freedom to work out the dynamics of low energy phenomena . in such a case , one might expect the cut - off to be much larger than the inverse size of the composite particles and the results not to be sensitive to the cut - off . in chiral quark models , however , this is not the case .",
    "the cut - offs required to fit @xmath3 are about @xmath4  mev , hardly larger than the @xmath5 or the nucleon mass .",
    "this is a fact of life , whether we like it or not .",
    "one can of course simply discard such models , but better models do not seem to be forthcoming .",
    "the non - local chiral quark model is defined by the euclidean action : @xmath6 in this expression , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the quark field , and @xmath9 is a regulator .",
    "the regulator is assumed to be diagonal in momentum space and it has a range which defines an effective euclidean cut - off @xmath10 .",
    "for example , we could take @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a euclidean 4-vector @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction term of the action ( [ nonlocact ] ) can be viewed as a contact 4-fermion interaction involving the _ delocalized quark fields _ : @xmath16    an action of the form ( [ nonlocact ] ) is derived from the instanton gas model of the qcd vacuum @xcite , which predicts a cut - off function of the form : @xmath17 where @xmath5 is the instanton size . the the cut - off is determined by the inverse instanton size @xmath18 . the form ( [ instanton ] ) has @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , at large euclidean momenta @xmath13 , the form ( [ instanton ] ) is no longer valid and the cut - off function is dominated by one gluon exchange .",
    "it decreases as @xmath21 ( with possible logarithmic corrections ) and not as @xmath22 .",
    "we find that the fall - off of the regulator at large euclidean @xmath23 does not affect the soliton properties very much .",
    "for this reason , we have felt free to use various simple forms of cut - off functions , such as a gaussian , which have an additional advantage in that they can be analytically ( although arbitrarily ) continued to negative values of @xmath23 .",
    "we shall see below that the analytic continuation is required to include the valence orbit .",
    "similar regularization has been used by the manchester group @xcite in the meson and vacuum sectors .",
    "various regularization schemes are reviewed in chapter 6 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the euclidean action allows us to calculate the partition function @xmath24 and the ground state energy @xmath25 the partition function can not be written in the form @xmath26 because the regulator in the action ( [ nonlocact ] ) prevents us from defining a hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "we are also unable to quantize the quark fields but we shall see that the baryon number is nonetheless properly quantized .",
    "we work with the equivalent bosonized form of the action : @xmath28 in which case the partition function is given by the path integral @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to @xmath30 , as the `` chiral field '' and we say that the chiral field is `` on the chiral circle '' if , for all @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an @xmath31-independent constant mass .    we have calculated a localized and time independent stationary point of the action ( [ isvs ] ) , consisting of a chiral field with a hedgehog shape @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the shape of the fields and the soliton energy can be calculated in terms of the energies @xmath35 of the quark orbit .",
    "the `` dirac hamiltonian '' is diagonal in the energy representation , although it remains energy dependent .",
    "the quark orbits @xmath36 satisfy the equations : @xmath37 the energy of the soliton is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 means that we subtract the vacuum energy . in the vacuum , @xmath40 @xmath41 and",
    "there is no valence orbit contribution @xmath42 .",
    "the latter is discussed in the next section .",
    "we calculate the baryon number from the noether current associated to the gauge transformation @xmath43 .",
    "it turns out to be : @xmath44 the extra term @xmath45 in the numerator arises from the fact that the regulator @xmath9 does not commute with @xmath46 its effect is to make the residues of all the poles of the quark propagator @xmath47 equal to unity .",
    "this effectively quantizes the baryon number in a manner which does not seem to be related to the topology of the hedgehog field .",
    "this is most fortunate because , a priori , there is no reason to expect a theory , in which we can not quantize the quark field , to yield a properly quantized baryon number .",
    "the expression ( [ number ] ) suggests a way to include the valence orbit so as to ensure that the baryon number of the soliton , relative to the vacuum , is equal to unity .",
    "we calculate `` on - shell '' pole of the quark propagator in the hedgehog background field by searching for a solution of the equation @xmath48 .",
    "because of the regulator , the solutions are scattered all over the complex @xmath49 plane . however , it is well known that , in the local theory , where we set @xmath50 , and for a hedgehog field with winding number unity , a well separated bound orbit with grand spin and parity @xmath51 occurs with energy @xmath42 close to zero @xcite . in the non - local theory , we find that a solution of the equation @xmath52 can always be found on the imaginary @xmath49 axis , close to the origin @xmath53 , and that no other pole occurs in the vicinity .",
    "we therefore ensure that the soliton has a baryon number @xmath54 by deforming the integration path over @xmath49 in such a way as to include the contribution of this pole .",
    "this requires an analytic continuation of the regulator .",
    "such a continuation is arbitrary but the analytic continuation does not extend as far from the origin as @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , since the soliton size is small , @xmath55 is large and this , on the average , makes @xmath56 less negative .",
    "unfortunately however , the form ( [ instanton ] ) of the regulator , predicted in the instanton model , does not allow any analytic continuation whatsoever , thereby , strictly , prohibiting its use in the soliton calculation .",
    "the model parameters are the coupling constant @xmath57 appearing in the lagrangian , the cut - off @xmath10 appearing in the regulator and the current quark mass @xmath58 .",
    "the values of the three parameters are constrained by fitting the pion decay constant @xmath59  mev and the pion mass to @xmath60  mev .",
    "the expression used to calculate the pion decay constant @xmath3 is : @xmath61 valid in the chiral limit @xmath62 and it is not identical to the pagels - stokar formula @xcite .",
    "this leaves one undetermined parameter which we choose to be the constituent quark mass @xmath33 at zero 4-momentum . the pion decay constant @xmath3 sets the scale .",
    "grossly , soliton energies increase and soliton radii diminish as @xmath3 increases ( see table [ golli5 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fige ] shows the soliton energy @xmath63 as a function of the free parameter @xmath33 .",
    "a soliton is a bound state of @xmath64 quarks which polarize the dirac sea . with a gaussian regulator ,",
    "it is formed if @xmath65  mev , that is , for a sufficiently strong coupling constant @xmath66  mev@xmath67 .",
    "the bound state occurs when the energy of the system is lower than the energy @xmath68 of @xmath0 free constituent quarks in the vacuum : @xmath69 .",
    "the mass @xmath70 is the on - shell constituent quark mass , obtained by searching for the pole of the quark propagator in the vacuum .",
    "it is the solution of the equation @xmath71 , which requires an analytic continuation of the regulator to negative values of @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fige ] also shows @xmath68 . at the critical value @xmath72  mev ,",
    "the two curves merge .",
    "the contribution @xmath73 of the valence orbit is also shown . at the critical value of @xmath33 ,",
    "the energy @xmath42 of the valence orbit , which is the on - shell mass of a quark propagating in the hedgehog field , becomes a well distinguished bound orbit .    at @xmath74  mev",
    ", the curve displaying @xmath68 on figure  [ fige ] abruptly stops . indeed , for larger values of @xmath33 , the poles of the quark propagator no longer occur for real values of @xmath23 .",
    "this means that quarks can no longer materialize on - shell in the vacuum .",
    "this feature is discussed in chapter 6 of ref.@xcite and it has been considered by several authors as a sign of quark confinement @xcite .",
    "in fact , when a pole of the quark propagator disappears from the real @xmath23 axis , it simply moves into the complex plane .",
    "such poles indicate instability of the assumed vacuum state against the addition of a single quark .",
    "however , our calculation shows that , in the background soliton field , the on - shell valence orbit continues to exist and so does the soliton .",
    "unfortunately , the regulator also introduces extra unwanted poles in the propagators of colorless mesons , so that the model does not express color confinement .",
    "similar unwanted poles occur in proper - time regularization @xcite .",
    "our ignorance as how to continue propagators in the complex @xmath23 plane reflects our ignorance of the confining mechanism @xcite .",
    "apart from the solitons consisting of three valence quarks we find stable solitons consisting of a single valence quark in the background soliton field ( see figure [ figes ] ) as well as of two valence quarks .",
    "similar solutions have been found in the linear sigma model with valence quarks @xcite .",
    "figure [ figmf ] shows the scalar and pseudoscalar fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the soliton obtained with several values of @xmath33 , together with the soliton quark density @xmath77 .",
    "note that , within the soliton , the fields _ do not _ lie on the chiral circle and @xmath78 . indeed , the pion component @xmath79 never reaches the values @xmath80 .",
    "this is a new dynamical result .",
    "this is the only calculation , as far we know , in which one can check dynamically whether the chiral field remains or not on the chiral circle .",
    "it could not be checked in the renormalized linear sigma model , because close lying landau poles occur which make the soliton unstable against high gradients in the fields @xcite .",
    "it could also not be checked in local theories which use proper - time regularization because , in such theories , the soliton is unstable unless the fields are constrained to remain on the chiral circle @xcite .",
    "no such instability occurs with the non - local regularization .",
    "the soliton we obtain with non - local regularization has a structure which lies midway between a friedberg - lee soliton @xcite ( in which the pion field has a vanishing classical value ) , and a skyrmion @xcite ( in which the chiral field is constrained to remain on the chiral circle ) .",
    "this raises the problem of the collective rotational motion of the soliton .",
    "if the deformation in spin and isospin space is stable enough to sustain a rotation without significant distortion , then the @xmath1 can be described as a rotation of the soliton and the @xmath81 mass splitting can be estimated by cranking . if , however , the deformation is small , the @xmath1 may be better described as a bound state of quarks with aligned spins and isospins .",
    "we have not tackled this problem yet .",

    "the non - local regularization effectively cuts out of the quark propagators the 4-momenta which are larger than the cut - off .",
    "the non - local regularization makes the theory finite at all loop orders .",
    "the simpler proper - time and pauli - villars regularization schemes regularize the quark loop only and they require extra independent cut - offs when next to leading order meson loops are included .",
    "both the real and the imaginary parts of the action are regularized , while the anomalous properties remain independent of the cut - off @xcite , and the baryon number remains properly quantized . in proper time and pauli - villars regularization schemes",
    "only the real part of the action is regularized and the imaginary part is left unregularized in order to enforce correct anomalous processes . why not limit the 3-momenta of the quarks , thereby avoiding unwanted extra poles in the propagators ?",
    "breaking lorentz covariance in the meson sector is annoying in that it requires to boost composite particles calculated in their rest frame ."
