    "the problem of the mass of elementary particles has two independent aspects in particle physics .",
    "the first , how mass arises , it is answered in the sm by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the second aspect is why different elementary particles have their specific masses .",
    "unless electromagnetic charge , there is no any , exact or approximate , known relation , structure or hierarchy among the masses of the sm elementary particles .",
    "evidence in favour of the existence of a boson with spin @xmath22 and properties compatible with those of a sm higgs particle ( production cross sections , mass - proportional couplings ) has been presented by the lhc experiments @xcite .    the aim of this work is to present some detailed phenomenological estimations of some ratios involving the experimental masses of the higgs boson , the vector bosons and the top quark , the derivation from them of some model independent expressions and detailed study of them in the framework of the sm . in the light of the recent results from the lhc coming from the experiments atlas and cms ,",
    "the parameter defined by the relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the masses of the @xmath25 gauge boson and the top quark and @xmath1 is the higgs mass has become experimentally measurable .",
    "we estimate its current value to be @xmath26 where we have used the current values for @xcite @xmath27 and the combined value of the boson masses presented by atlas and cms @xcite , @xmath28 the combined value of the boson mass is obtained by standard statistic techniques , we neglect correlations among the systematic component of the errors .",
    "the value ( [ eq2 ] ) is obtained by a mc simulation .",
    "first , a distribution of the quotient is obtained by generating gaussian ensembles of the individual masses .",
    "second , symmetric gaussian fit , fig.([fig1 ] ) , is performed to the central part of this ( close to symmetric ) distribution avoiding the non - gaussian tail .",
    "the central value and @xmath29 errors appearing in ( [ eq2 ] ) are extracted from this fitted gaussian . if the individual values for each ot the experiments are used instead ( using a similar statistical procedure ) , we get ( see fig.([fig1])(up ) ) @xmath30 for boson masses respectively @xmath31 and @xmath32 the conclusion is that the experimental value of the ratio @xmath33 is close to one with a precision of the order or less than @xmath7 .",
    "this precision is not far from the precision at which the well known ratio @xmath34 is presentely measured , @xmath35 @xcite with @xmath36 the weinberg angle and @xmath37 the charged electroweak gauge boson mass",
    ". the closeness of this parameter @xmath33 to one might be merely a coincidence which will dissapear with any new measurement or might be not .",
    "note that the ratio would be exactly one for a boson mass ( and nominal @xmath24 pdg masses ) of @xmath38 a value somewhere inbetween of the @xmath39 range of values currently measured by lhc and just on the borderline of the sm vacuum stability limits @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath33 would be still close to one , with a precision of @xmath40 , if the higgs mass appear finally anywhere in the range @xmath41 .",
    "if we vary the top mass in the range @xmath42 similar results are obtained .",
    "similar ratios involving other fermion masses instead of the top mass could be obviously defined , for example including all the fermions we could define @xmath43 as @xmath44 with @xmath45 or including the third family quark doublet ( @xmath46 ) we could define the ratio @xmath47 in any case , any of these or similar ratios are deviated from @xmath33 by a very moderate quantity @xmath48 .",
    "it is also interesting to consider an alternative way to express the closeness of the ratio @xmath33 to one . if we consider the individual mass rations @xmath49 , their current experimental values are @xmath50 where we have taken the lhc combined value of @xmath1 . and",
    "pdg @xmath24 masses .",
    "both ratios are the same at the level of 1% ( and totally compatible at even higher precision according to present error bars ) .",
    "very similar results are obtained if we use any of the atlas or cms individual measurements    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     similarly to @xmath33 we define now another ratio of masses involving the higgs , vector bosons and top quarks , whose experimental value is also seen to be close to one .",
    "let us take @xmath51 where @xmath37 is the mass of the @xmath52 boson .",
    "we estimate the current value of this ratio ( using a similar mc technique as explained above , see fig.([fig1])(down ) ) to be @xmath53 where we have used the current value for @xmath54 @xcite @xmath55 and the combined value for the higgs mass , eq.([eq12zz ] ) .",
    "if the individual values for each of the experiments are used instead , we get @xmath56 the experimental value of the ratio @xmath57 is close to one with a precision of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless the favoured value is around 2@xmath58 from being exactly one .",
    "the higgs mass is numerically close to the aritmethic average of the charged boson and top masses @xmath8 .",
    "the ratios @xmath33 and @xmath57 are a priori independent .    the relations @xmath59 imply that any two of the quantities @xmath60 can be written in terms of the other two . taking into account also the relation @xmath61 we can write any two mass ratios as a function of , exclusively , the weinberg angle ( with a precision of the order of @xmath7 or better ) : @xmath62 examples of these relations are : @xmath63 in the limit @xmath12 all the masses would become equal @xmath13 .",
    "the latest lhc measurements @xcite , in particular the characteristics of the seen @xmath64 channel , point to a preferred discovery of a neutral boson of spin 0 . in a model independent way , thus the quantity @xmath33 can be viewed as the ratio of the highest massive representatives of the spin @xmath65 particles of the standard model and , to a very good precision the experimental evidence tell us that @xmath66 somehow the mass of the `` lowest '' scalar particle mass is numerically the geometric mean of the highest spin 1 and spin 1/2 masses .",
    "let us now assume that the new particle is a scalar higgs boson . in the standard model ( sm ) with a higgs sector consistent of one higgs doublet @xmath67 and scalar potential @xmath68 all masses are induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking and are proportional to the higgs vaccuum expectation @xmath69 where @xmath70 the tree level top , gauge and higgs boson masses are given in terms of @xmath71 and their respective yukawa couplings @xmath72 moreover we have @xmath73 or @xmath74,@xmath75 .    in terms of these quantities",
    "the tree level mass ratio @xmath33 is simply given by @xmath76    similarly , the tree level sm @xmath57 ratio is given by : @xmath77    numerically , we estimate the top yukawa , quartic coupling and other related ratios as ( from measured masses , using tree level approximation , @xmath29 errors ) : @xmath78    in the sm , the higgs selfcoupling @xmath79 is non - determined . however , assuming that _ both _",
    "expressions @xmath80 are not a coincidence , the relations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq19zz ] ) tell us that the scalar self - couplings , gauge couplings and yukawa top couplings are related by two expressions . at tree level any two of the quantities @xmath81 can be written in terms the two others using the expressions : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a numeric factor of order @xmath84 .",
    "if we take into account only the first expression , the one related to the ratio @xmath33 , we arrive to the relation between the quartic , gauge and top couplings @xmath85 let us take now into account both expressions . for @xmath86",
    "the second equation becomes @xmath87 , inserting it in the first one we arrive to @xmath88 with @xmath15 .",
    "the tree level relations ( [ eq19],[eq19zz ] ) are affected by sm quantum corrections .",
    "including one loop corrections , the three level relations above should be replaced , in particular by ( where @xmath89 the renormalization scale , @xmath90 ) @xmath91 we consider negligible the running of the gauging couplings @xmath92 .",
    "the first order corrected ratio @xmath33 is then , using expresions ( [ eq27],[eq28 ] ) , @xmath93 the top yukawa @xmath94 can be written as @xmath95 . the corrections are ( @xcite and references therein ) , ignoring logarithm terms , @xmath96 with the numerical coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "thus @xmath99 then @xmath100 the correction @xmath101 is the most important one , acting to diminish slightly the ratio .",
    "both corrections , @xmath102 , are of opposite sign and very small , of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "we explore here the behaviour of the mass ratio ( [ eq2],[eq22 ] ) at higher scales . we consider first a reduced system of one - loop renormalization group equations where only the higgs self - coupling @xmath79 and the top yukawa coupling @xmath103 appear .",
    "all the other couplings are considered very small or not running at all .",
    "the rge equations for the individual couplings take the form ( see for example @xcite ) ( with @xmath104 , expression valid for high , but no so high , scales @xmath105 , or for @xmath106 ) : @xmath107 if we introduce the variable @xmath108 the rge equations for @xmath109 and @xmath110 become decoupled with nested solutions , @xmath111,@xmath112,@xmath113 .",
    "in addition to eq.([eq40 ] ) , we have @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "the equations ( [ eq40],[eq43],[eq45 ] ) can be solved explicitly , in particular for the ratio @xmath33 we can write @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the fixed points of the equation ( [ eq43 ] ) , @xmath118 . for a light higgs and large top mass",
    "the ratio @xmath119 is small , at low scales @xmath120 , eq.([eq25 ] ) .",
    "for such a small @xmath119 the solution of the differential equations is approximately : @xmath121 and @xmath122 at large energies ( @xmath123 , as long as @xmath124 or @xmath125 ) , the ratio @xmath126 keeps approximately constant , only sligtly decreasing with the logarithm of @xmath103 .    if we consider a reduced higgs - top - strong system where the @xmath127 are non - vanishing and allowed to run together with the ratios @xmath128 .",
    "one ends with a similar system of equations where the evolution of @xmath33 is of the type @xmath129 and similar results are obtained . at higher energies , and for more quantitative results , a full treatment is needed .",
    "present state - of - the - art nlo and nnlo constraints on sm vacuum stability @xcite seems to guarantee stability , and then a reasonably stable , positive , value for the quartic coupling , for a higgs mass @xmath130 and to very high scales .. if we assume a stable behaviour for @xmath79 and ignoring the very modest variation of the coupling factor @xmath131 , @xmath132 the variation of the mass ratio @xmath33 is governed by the top yukawa up to scales where new physics is expected to emerge .",
    "we expect new physics that cuts off the divergent top , gauge and higgs loop contributions to the higgs mass at scales @xmath133 tev .",
    "many different possibilities have been well explored , they usually include , more or less ad - hoc , new particles with properties tightly associated to those of the sm . some of these possibilities are for example ( and any combinations among them)@xcite : a ) the new particles are just the , softly broken , susy , superpartners with couplings and yukawas strongly dictated by supersymmetry and the soft breaking itself .",
    "b ) the higgs is a composite resonance , or c ) the `` little '' higgs is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson with respect a `` softly '' broken approximate global symmetry .",
    "this scalar sector is accompanied by some new particles belonging to enlarged multiplets together with the sm particles .",
    "it is a general feature that , in all or most of these models , the quartic self coupling , and then the higgs mass , is related to the gauge coupling constants and to the top yukawa in a more or less explicit way , reminding of the relation ( [ eq25 ] ) suggested by the experimental evidence @xmath134 .",
    "the reason is clear @xcite , the new one - loop which are proportional to the couplings of the sm gauge sector ( or to a subsector of an enlarged gauge sector ) have to match and cancel the top and the other cuadratic loops .",
    "we will briefly review the situation in the mssm and littlest higgs scenarios . in the mssm ,",
    "the tree level top , gauge and lowest higgs boson masses together their respective yukawa couplings are given by the expressions @xmath135 where the tree level higgs quartic coupling is determined in terms of the gauge couplings @xmath136    quantum corrections to the higgs quartic coupling are very important .",
    "they lead for an expression for the lower neutral higgs mass , of the form @xcite @xmath137 where the factor @xmath138 include logarithmic corrections , mainly associated to stops . from the expression ( [ mhmssm ] ) and from @xmath139 we can extract an improved value for the quartic effective coupling @xmath140 the effective quartic coupling is of the natural size @xmath141 . in terms of these quantities the mass ratio @xmath33",
    "is simply given by @xmath142 in the context of the mssm , the experimental evidence @xmath134 is a strong hint for the existence of a relation among the parameters of the expression above , principally top yukawa and @xmath143 together with the gauge couplings .    as a second illustrative example , let us mention the `` littlest '' higgs scenario @xcite . here",
    "the usual higgs doublet , is the lightest of a set of pseudo goldstone bosons in an non - linear sigma model including in its gauge group different @xmath144 factors .",
    "the product group is broken to the diagonal , identified as the sm electroweak gauge group .",
    "the top yukawa coupling generates a negative mass squared triggering electrowak symmetry breaking .",
    "new particles are added , in particular heavy top partners , which cancel the one loop quadratically divergent corrections .",
    "the quartic self coupling is related to the coupling constants of the gauge sector and to the top yukawa with a natural size @xmath145 reminding , for example , the expression ( [ eq29zz ] ) suggested by experimental evidence .",
    "particular scenarios can be tuned so that either the gauge contributions or the top yukawas dominate the higgs quartic and @xmath146 or @xmath147 as extreme cases .",
    "in fact we have seen , according to eq.([eq2 ] ) , that nature chooses , to a very high precision , just the geometric average of both extreme cases @xmath148 .",
    "it seems plausible that a little higgs scenario can be found where this value appears naturally .",
    "approximate accidental global symmetries related to the little higgs scenario could play a role in the understanding of the @xmath33 ratio , as the global custodial @xmath17 symmetry @xcite plays for the @xmath149 ratio .    in this short note",
    "we have presented some simple computations associated to the ratio of the product of @xmath25 and top masses to the squared higgs mass , @xmath33 .",
    "we have shown how this ratio is suprisingly and robustly close to the unity at the @xmath150 level .",
    "the higgs mass seems to be just the geometrical mean of the @xmath151 and @xmath152 masses .",
    "we have briefly reviewed the theoretical predictions of this ratio in the sm and beyond . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs selfcoupling @xmath79 is undetermined .",
    "however , assuming that the value @xmath153 is not merely a coincidence , the relation eq.([eq19 ] ) tell us that the scalar self - coupling and the spin 1 and spin 1/2 top couplings are subject to the tree level equality @xmath154 where @xmath83 is a numeric factor of order @xmath84 .",
    "such a relation is not very much affected by quantum effects at least up to scales @xmath155 or slightly higher .      in a model independent way , the relations @xmath59 imply that any two of the quantities @xmath60 can be written in terms of the other two . taking into account also the relation @xmath61 we can write any two mass ratios as a function of , exclusively , the weinberg angle ( with a precision of the order of @xmath7 or better ) @xmath158,@xmath159 . in the limit @xmath12 all the masses would become equal @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of such relations could be interpreted as a hint for an instrumental role , together with some other unknown symmetry , of the @xmath17 custodial symmetry in the explanation of the @xmath160 ratio @xcite .",
    "the closeness of the parameter @xmath18 to one , `` the higgs mass coincidence problem '' , might be merely a coincidence or an artifact of the early status of the higgs discovery , which will dissapear with any new measurement .",
    "it is tempting to think that such a value of the ratios are , on naturalness grounds , a signal of a deeper mechanism or symmetry .",
