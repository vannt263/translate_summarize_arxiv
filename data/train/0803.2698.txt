    "ventricular arrhythmia is the leading cause of cardiac arrest and sudden death .",
    "clinical observations and implantable cardioverter defibrillators have accumulated a substantial amount of data on the occurrences of ventricular arrhythmia in patients [ 1 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 52 , 59 - 61 ] .",
    "temporal patterns of initiations and terminations of ventricular arrhythmia tend to exhibit substantial variations across different time scales , and their occurrences do not correlate decisively with medication , exertion , stress , lifestyles and similar factors .",
    "arrhythmia events are not random ; they show circadian patterns [ 36 , 60 ] and also tend to occur in clusters . however , the detection times between consecutive events and clusters are spread out over time [ 37 , 52 , 59 ] , making it difficult to understand their causes and make predictions about their occurrences . unlike the circadian patterns ,",
    "these clusterings or their patterns of occurrences are not affected by the long - term administration of antiarrhythmic drugs [ 59 ] . in spite of the abundant data in existence ,",
    "the basis for non - circadian patterns is not well - understood .",
    "many factors , ranging from internal cardiac mechanisms to external chance events play significant roles in shaping the electrocardiogram ( ecg )  recordings and the implantable defibrillator data . separating",
    "all of the possible contributions is a formidable task , but understanding the influences of various factors and the extent to which each plays a role may have important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of tachyarrhythmias .",
    "a number of prior studies using special preparations of animal cell cultures establish that complex , spontaneously generated patterns may occur without some of the features peculiar to the heart ( e.g. the 3-dimensional geometry or biological features such as valves , different tissue layers and types , etc ) [ 3 , 25 , 35 , 44 ] .",
    "these studies also indicate ( both theoretically and experimentally ) that causes external to the heart , whether random or deterministic , are not always necessary for the occurrence of irregular behavior . a different class of studies that involve interactive self - oscillatory sources also establish the capability of basic cardiac mechanisms to generate complex rhythms without considering the whole heart [ 23 , 28 , 43 ] .",
    "from these and similar studies it may be inferred that changes in the basic internal cardiac mechanisms can play a significant role in generating and sustaining arrhythmias . to clarify the role of these basic internal mechanisms at a fundamental level , in this paper we focus on the unidirectional reentrant circulation of action potentials in a loop of ventricular tissue .",
    "because of their pervasiveness , relative simplicity and importance in clinical arrhythmogenesis reentrant loops have received a great deal of attention [ 4 , 8 , 11 , 14 - 16 , 20 , 26 , 30 , 41 , 44 , 48 - 50 , 55 ] .",
    "studying spontaneous initiation and termination of reentry ( sitr ) patterns in the loop context is considerably simpler than in the whole heart and can offer potentially useful insights into the clinically observed patterns of arrhythmia . in the construction of a workable model , a certain level of abstraction bridges over physiological complexities that do not play a central role in the long - term evolution of temporal patterns .    in this paper",
    "we consider a model that combines the traditional discrete loop with a pacer to form an interactive system .",
    "fundamental thresholds are dynamically integrated so they can either trigger reentry or inhibit it .",
    "although a relatively simple mechanism , this composite system has two important features : it is an essential component of a well - known cardiac anomaly ; and it is capable of generating complex initiation and termination patterns .    in a series of case - studies",
    "we show that the loop - pacer mechanism may be responsible for irregularities in onset and termination of reentry beyond such pervasive factors as tissue heterogeneity , the geometry of the heart and other physiological and non - physiological factors .",
    "even without such complexities , the sitr  patterns generated by the loop - pacer system can be complex ; i.e. they contain many regular features yet their evolution over time is difficult to predict .",
    "we trace this complexity to the interaction of a threshold with bistability of the reentrant circulation and in some cases , also to the inherent discontinuity of phase resetting interactions between the loop and the pacer .",
    "bistability is an inherent physiological characteristic that may be attributed to non - uniformities in the  restitution of action potential duration ( apd ) ; this feature emerges prominently when conduction velocity ( cv ) is properly matched with apd .",
    "when this happens ( e.g. when the length of the loop is within a certain range ) the sitr patterns become considerably more complex and unpredictable .",
    "in this section we describe the main features of the loop - pacer model , leaving a few additional details to section 4 .",
    "the pacer is a self - oscillatory mechanism that is tied to the reentrant circuit ( the loop in this paper ) via a time lag or delay parameter and a special threshold .",
    "consider a loop of cardiac tissue consisting of cells that conduct action potentials and assume that a single conducting pathway connects the loop to the rest of the heart .",
    "let the physical length of the loop be denoted by @xmath4 measured in centimeters .",
    "divide the loop into @xmath5 sets or aggregates of cells , each of which may be called a _ cell aggregate _ or for brevity , just a cell .",
    "the cell aggregate that is connected to the only pathway out of the loop is also the gateway through which pulses enter the loop or exit it ; we label it cell 1 ; see figure 1 .",
    "this cell is adjacent not only to cell 2 , but also to cell @xmath5 at its other end .",
    "[ schematicloop ]        for each integer @xmath6 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 label the length of the @xmath6-th cell @xmath9 these cell aggregates lengths are not necessarily equal but of course , they add up to @xmath10 since each cell aggregate must have at least one cardiac cell in it , @xmath11 has a natural lower bound , namely the nominal length of a single cardiac cell ( about 0.01 cm or 100 microns ) .",
    "the closer all @xmath11 are to this lower bound , the greater is the number @xmath5 of cell aggregates in a loop of fixed length @xmath4 ; for a 12 cm loop with cells of length 0.01 cm , the number of cells is 1200 .",
    "while for discrete modeling it is not necessary to pick @xmath5 that large , it needs to be large enough ( hence each cell aggregate small enough ) that the conduction velocity from one end of an aggregate to the other can be taken to be approximately constant .",
    "this assumption is essential if the restitution of conduction time ( ct ) is defined in terms of the restitution of cv , as we do later on .",
    "we assume that all the cardiac cells within a given aggregate are identical .",
    "if all cells in the _ entire loop _ have identical physiological characteristics then we may also let cell aggregates all have equal lengths .",
    "in such a case , the loop is said to be homogeneous .",
    "otherwise the loop is heterogeneous .    to initiate unidirectional circulation ,",
    "it is necessary that a unidirectional block ( ub ) exist somewhere in the loop ; for simplicity , we place it in cell 1 , the gateway to the loop ; see figure 1 .",
    "thus cell 1 is able to activate cell 2 but not cell @xmath12 for our simulations , we use a simplified version of the ub time window that is defined by a threshold value for the diastolic interval ( di ) .",
    "thus conduction is blocked in any cell whose di is not greater than the threshold @xmath13 ; see section 4 below for more details .",
    "such a minimum value is used in [ 26 ] as a termination mechanism for explaining the experimental results of [ 20 ] ; also see [ 19 ] .",
    "we use the term restitution  generally for relations that give a particular quantity , e.g. action potential duration or conduction time , as a function of the diastolic interval ( di ) .",
    "the di ( usually measured in milliseconds , ms ) is the rest or recovery period for the cell which essentially starts with the end of the refractory period and ends when the cell is activated again .      in its most basic form ,",
    "the action potential duration or apd is the length of time ( usually measured in milliseconds , ms ) that a cell is active after excitation . for our purposes",
    ", we may think of apd as a cell s effective refractory period ( erp ) during which no excitations , even strong ones , can elicit new action potentials .",
    "the restitution of apd , which can be experimentally measured or derived from ionic models , is the most extensively studied of restitution relations [ 2 , 4 - 8 , 10 , 11 , 21 , 24 , 26 , 29 , 32 , 33 , 42 , 45 , 48 , 50 , 53 - 57 ] . any apd restitution function , whether experimentally measured or analytically derived can be used in this model .  for the numerical simulations in this paper",
    ", we use an apd  restitution function that is fitted to the experimental data by koller , et al [ 33 ] where apd values were recorded in two types of patients , those with and those without structural heart disease ( shd ) .",
    "the following is a possible fit to their averaged data displayed in figure 1 in [ 33 ] for shd  patients : @xmath14 with parameter values    [ c]|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|@xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + 350 & 157 & 8 & 20 & 1700 & 1200 & 0.0021 & 0.025 & 0.0004 & 80 & 136 & 82 +    a graph of this function is shown in figure 2 . expressing the apd as a function of di in the above manner represents only a first order of approximation ( see section 4 below ) .",
    "[ apdrc ]          each cell conducts an action potential through it in a finite amount of time .",
    "this time interval , usually measured in milliseconds , is referred to as the conduction time ( ct ) [ 4 , 26 , 50 ] .",
    "experimentally measured ct restitution functions are not as readily available for human hearts as the apd restitution functions ; however , they may be readily derived from cv restitution functions through the relation@xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the ct and the cv restitution functions .",
    "this derivation is valid if as mentioned earlier , @xmath29 is essentially constant over the length of each cell ( or cell aggregate ) and thus no spatial dependence is required in @xmath30    for discussions of cv restitution functions see [ 2 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 14 - 16 , 20 , 22 , 53 , 54 , 56 ] . for our simulations we use the following expression @xmath31,\\quad di>0 \\label{ct}%\\ ] ] with parameter values :    [ c]|c|c|c|c|@xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + 0.1 cm & 0.07 cm / ms & 1 & 0.02 ms@xmath36 +    these numbers are obtained using ( [ cv2ct ] ) and a reasonable fit to the human - rescaled , guinea pig data for cv from [ 22 , 54 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath32 corresponds to 10 nominal cells .",
    "the number @xmath33 in ( [ ct])is the maximum cv ; in more common ( though less uniform ) units , the fitted number in the above table would be 0.7 m / s . by changing the parameters in ( [ ct ] )",
    "we may achieve conduction slow - downs in different ways , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "[ ctrc ]     and @xmath37 .",

    "if reentry is initiated and interrupted then the pacer and the loop fall out of phase and it is necessary to carefully model their interaction . for this purpose",
    "we define two rhythms or clocks : the pacer s rhythm which has a prescribed beat pattern ( fixed or variable ) and the system s rhythm which is reset when reentry is initiated or terminated .",
    "these two rhythms are related via a pacer threshold ( seen the next section ) and a delay term that we now define .",
    "the _ time of occurrence _ for the @xmath43-th beat ( following a fixed reference beat ) can be tracked and calculated using the following quantity , namely , the sum of usually variable cycle lengths ( after a di adjustment ) :    @xmath44    let the time of occurrence of the @xmath45-th pacer beat be denoted by @xmath46 ( starting from the same reference point in time as that for @xmath47 ) .",
    "the difference @xmath48 is the duration of each such beat . in our simulations @xmath49",
    "is defined arbitrarily in order to facilitate our study of the sitr patterns .",
    "if the pacer is the sinus node then @xmath49 is influenced by a variety of deterministic and stochastic factors , such as circadian , weekly and seasonal variations , lifestyles , drugs , the autonomic system and so on .",
    "thus a single , all purpose formula for @xmath49 does not exist .",
    "the two rhythms @xmath47 and @xmath46 fall out of phase if reentry occurs as noted earlier .",
    "to model their interaction , we define the _ first _ pacer pulse that reaches cell 1 in beat @xmath43 as the _ least _ integer @xmath50 such that @xmath51    the variable delay term @xmath52 here represents a _ time lag _ that results from the blocking of the pacer by the retrograde reentrant wave propagating toward the pacer .",
    "a number of things may affect @xmath52 ; these include the different types of tissue in which pulses propagate ( retrograde and antegrade ) , the electrotonic spread of current in conducting tissue between the pacer and the loop , and the effect of reentrant waves on the pacer s intrinsic beat rate .",
    "for simplicity we do not consider the electrotonic currents and tissue heterogeneity .",
    "we assume also that the pacer itself is protected in the sense that it s intrinsic beat rate is not affected by the reentrant activity .",
    "therefore , we use a simple definition for @xmath52 as follows:@xmath53{ll}% \\delta , & \\text{if pulse } n-1\\text { was reentrant}\\\\ di^{\\ast } , & \\text{otherwise } % \\end{array } \\right .   , \\ \\delta",
    "> di^{\\ast}.\\ ] ]    if the loop is not in  reentry , then @xmath52 may take the minimum value @xmath13 since cell 1 must have at least that much rest time after its erp before it can be reactivated .",
    "high frequency reentrant waves typically disassociate a slow pacer such as the sinus node .",
    "this situation is modeled here by choosing a sufficiently large value of the delay parameter @xmath54 so as to inhibit the pacer from interfering with the reentrant circulation .",
    "small values for @xmath54 , which promote pacer interference , may be feasible in certain circumstances , e.g. when there are pathways from the pacer s site to the site of the loop that are protected from the fast reentrant waves by pathologies .    to determine the index value @xmath50 we may generate the sequence @xmath46 independently of @xmath47 and for each @xmath43 mark the values @xmath50 that satisfy ( [ kn ] ) .",
    "this process is carried out internally during each simulation run ; an analytical relationship is generally not easy to find .",
    "however , if @xmath55 is constant then such a relationship is easy to find ; in this case we have @xmath56 with @xmath57",
    "i.e. , the least integer that is greater than or equal to the ratio @xmath58 this simple relationship makes explicit the discontinuity that results from phase resetting in our model .",
    "we distinguish between two primary dynamic modes for the loop - pacer system : the _ reentry mode _ where an action potential circulates in the loop by itself and the _ paced mode _ where the action potential in the loop comes from the pacer .",
    "the system s mode in each beat changes on the basis of threshold relations to be defined below .",
    "the modes are defined by systems of partial difference equations that track the circulating pulse in both space and time .",
    "introductory material on ordinary and partial difference equations can be found in [ 9 , 17 , 31 , 40 , 51 ] . technically , the dynamical system consisting of the loop , the pacer and the associated thresholds is a polymodal structure in the sense of [ 51 ] .",

    "for simplicity we do not consider such effects in this paper ; however , a suitable modification of the apd restitution function that incorporates explicit time dependence can accommodate dynamically - induced shifts .      experimental evidence is offered in [ 53 ] that the apd restitution curve may be non - monotonic for small di values .",
    "working with a apd restitution curve having a single local minimum at low di , the same study demonstrates the occurrence of spatial bifurcations along the length of a periodically paced fiber of cardiac tissue .",
    "although not involving a loop structure , the work in [ 53 ] uses restitution functions in a discrete model .",
    "a localized form of non - monotonicity ( like a bump or dent ) in apd may occur at any di value and has interesting consequences for additional complexity in reentry mode . in [ 48 ] where a continuous model of the loop as a cable is used , this type of non - monotonicity is shown to be responsible for the appearance of spatio - temporal chaos in apd and other key variables over the length of the loop .",
    "the occurrence of spatio - temporal chaos on the loop may raise the level of unpredictability in sitr if the amplitudes of oscillations in di are large enough to let the wavefront reach its tail ( thus causing a threshold failure ) .",
    "various anatomical and functional mechanisms for ub in a loop are discussed in the model study [ 49 ] .",
    "these mechanisms include a properly timed premature stimulus delivered to a suitable location in the loop , inhomogeneities in the degree of cellular uncoupling and gap junction resistance , in membrane excitability and in fiber cross sectional area .",
    "the discussion in [ 49 ] points to time , space and voltage windows of vulnerability  for the occurrence of unidirectional block and initiation of reentry . of these",
    ", the time window is seen to be the easiest to measure and its value is related to the space and voltage windows via standard mathematical formulas .",
    "each cell requires a certain amount of depolarizing current to fire an action potential .",
    "this _ activation threshold _ can be represented by a restitution function [ 27 ] or equivalently , the strength - interval curve [ 13 ] shifted to the left so that the origin represents the end of the erp . in figure 10 this curve is shown as a decreasing restitution function @xmath157 .    in principle , at any time following the end of the erp a sufficiently large current will be able to elicit an action potential .",
    "however , in the absence of external electrical shocks , there is a limited amount of current @xmath158 available to depolarize the next cell .",
    "if a restitution of @xmath158 is given then the intersection point of @xmath157 and @xmath158 is the @xmath159 threshold or cut - off value @xmath13 in the sense that if @xmath160 then action potential is fired and propagation occurs .",
    "the time interval @xmath13 is similar in nature to the chronaxie  [ 47 ] although the definition of @xmath13 requires another restitution curve in addition to @xmath161 a monotonically increasing restitution function for @xmath158 might be appropriate ; see figure 10 .",
    "[ currents ]     and @xmath162 . in this figure , @xmath163 ( see text).,width=288 ]    for our purposes here we do not need explicit formulas for either @xmath157 or @xmath164 the value @xmath13 may be chosen arbitrarily or estimated experimentally without reference to its potential sources .",
    "values as high as 160 ms were used in [ 26 ] . in human cases the value of @xmath13 in vivo is likely to be in a much smaller range .",
    "we use the conservatively small value of about 15 ms in this study .",
    "an analog of the time window in [ 49 ] can be defined here using the restitution functions @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "we define two sets of currents restitution functions for cell 1 corresponding to the two possible directions in the loop : @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , @xmath168 for the left  and the right  directions .",
    "the asymmetry creates a _ ub window _ in cell 1 as follows : let @xmath169 and @xmath170 with at least one of these inequalities strict .",
    "let @xmath13 be the ( unique ) intersection point of @xmath165 and @xmath167 and let @xmath162 to be the intersection point of @xmath166 and @xmath171 then @xmath172 and the interval between these two values is where the ub occurs . for",
    "if @xmath76 represents the di of cell 1 in a cycle or beat @xmath173 then the conditions @xmath174 imply that propagation is possible in one direction because the threshold marked by @xmath13 is crossed but it is inhibited in the other direction where the @xmath162 threshold is not crossed .",
    "we emphasize that the unidirectional block as defined here is functional and may not occur even if the ub window exists ( for anatomical or functional reasons ) .",
    "if the number @xmath76 does not enter the the ub window ( i.e. the interval from @xmath13 to @xmath162 ) in a particular beat @xmath43 then the ub  does not materialize .",
    "this option adds another mode to the loop - pacer system , namely the bdc mode mentioned previously .",
    "in addition to tc and tp , the following threshold is associated wtih the bdc mode :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ tub : @xmath175 with beat @xmath63 in the paced  mode . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this inequality defines the _ ub threshold _ to ensure that cell 1 conducts unidirectionally .",
    "if beat @xmath63 is in reentry mode then conduction in beat @xmath43 is automatically unidirectional whether tub holds or not , because the pulse is transmitted from a still active cell @xmath12 to limit the variety of cases to consider , we assume in this paper that @xmath162 is so large that the unidirectional block is always present in cell 1 ( permanent ub ) so tub always holds .",
    "in the preceding sections , we developed an interactive loop - pacer threshold model that is a part of a familiar cardiac anomaly . using experimental data on restitution parameters from the existing literature for action potential duration and conduction time",
    ", we obtained various conditions and parameter values that would cause irregular patterns of spontaneous initiations and terminations of reentry .",
    "a major cause of unpredictable behavior is threshold bistability where one stable regime causes a failure of the circulation threshold tc and another does not . in this situation",
    "the initiation and termination of reentry depends on the location of the di state vector in the @xmath5-dimensional state space , where the nonlinearity in propagation equations makes it difficult to track the state vector .",
    "thus , it is quite difficult to forecast the long - term behavior of an evolving sitr  pattern for a t - bistable loop .",
    "another potential source of unpredictability is the interference by the pacer .",
    "if reentry occurs , then the pacer and the reentrant circuit are thrown out of phase so a phase resetting pacer pulse may unexpectedly end the reentrant circulation .",
    "a number of prior studies of a different nature from ours also find complex sitr patterns in simple settings , such as in sheets [ 3 , 25 ] , loops [ 44 ] and aggregates [ 35 ] of animal cardiac tissue . in [ 3 ] and",
    "[ 25 ] complex patterns in monolayers of growing cell cultures are linked to changing densities and to local inhomogeneities , respectively . in [ 35 ]",
    "bursting beat patterns are studied in cell aggregates under external pacing .",
    "closer to the subject matter of this paper , in [ 44 ] a ring - shaped lab preparation is considered with two localized pacemakers .",
    "threshold relations for handling the pacers in this loop appear in the mathematical discussion . in a different class of studies , namely , the modulated parasystole , a permanent ectopic rhythm coexists with the sinus or another competing rhythm . in such relatively simple systems ,",
    "complex beat patterns arise that are highly sensitive to parameter changes [ 23 , 28 , 43 ] . like the tp threshold in our model ,",
    "a mathematical relation with a discontinuity is responsible for the complexity of temporal patterns in parasystole ; see [ 23 , 43 ] .",
    "we omitted many features from our discussion here that one might include in an enhanced version of this model .",
    "for example , ub may be treated functionally by refining the ub time window and considering bidirectional propagation in the loop , as noted above .",
    "other enhancements to this model might include adding memory and latency to the apd restitution function .",
    "the inclusion of memory is especially important in clarifying the dynamic significance of delayed responses ( not to mention improved fits to the apd restitution data ) .",
    "additional directions for exploring the dynamics of the loop - pacer system include consideration of multiple exit / entry points into the loop that can affect reentry , a systematic approach to heterogeneity and also some theory to better model the time lag @xmath52 that influences the loop - pacer interactions",
    ". a somewhat different direction that may be explored would be to incorporate a programmed shock routine to artificially end long bursts of fast , reentrant beats .    with some of the above enhancements the sitr patterns will likely become more complex and less predictable , though it is also possible that some of these enhancements ( e.g. memory ) can have a moderating effect .",
