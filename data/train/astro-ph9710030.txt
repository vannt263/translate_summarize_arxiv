    "the method of starcounts as applied to the study of the general properties of the milky way has become a very effective way of constraining global structural parameters for the galaxy ( reid & majewski 1993 ) , and novel multivariate data analysis methods are being applied to recent surveys to characterize the individual stellar distributions of each population , which would be otherwise unrecognizable ( chen 1996 , 1997 ) .    evidently , most previous comparisons between observed & predicted starcounts have avoided the large - extinction , low - galactic latitude regions ( bahcall 1986 ) , where the dominant factor determining the observed counts is the distribution of interstellar reddening , whose complex nature would make such an analysis very difficult .    however , there are a number of situations where one may want to evaluate the expected number of stars at low - galactic latitudes .",
    "a few examples are the need for estimating diffuse starlight in the plane of the milky - way for comparisons with observations ( mattila 1980a , b , van der kruit 1986 , toller 1990 ) , the evaluation of the corrections to absolute proper - motion and parallax ( van altena 1974 , monet 1988 ) , and the evaluation of the expected kinematic distribution of stars at low - galactic latitude for comparisons with the upcoming large digitized surveys ( humphreys 1993 ) .",
    "mndez ( 1995 , also mndez & van altena 1996 ) has developed a galactic structure model , capable of predicting starcounts _ self - consistently _ with the kinematic distribution of stars for any line - of - sight .",
    "evidently , in order to evaluate star and color counts , as well as the expected kinematic properties of stars at low - galactic latitudes , we need to provide such a model with the proper reddening values . for certain applications",
    ", one could use specifically pre - determined values of reddening as a function of heliocentric distance ( i.e. , a _ reddening map _ ) .",
    "however , in many instances , evaluations need to be performed at locations where no specific determination of the reddening has been made , and in such cases , we need to resort to the available low - latitude reddening surveys as a means of estimating the reddening for that particular location .    for the purposes outlined above , we have developed a reddening model , based on what we know about the clumpy nature of the reddening material in the solar neighborhood from different surveys .",
    "we have incorporated also what it is known about its large - scale structure from those surveys , in order to interpolate the reddening values at locations different from those studied in the available literature . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the reddening model in detail , sect .  3 describes our comparisons to starcounts at low - galactic latitudes from the guide star catalogue , and in sect .",
    "4 we present our main conclusions .",
    "while interstellar absorption , in general , is caused by the mere appearance of material along the line - of - sight ( diffuse gas and dust grains ) , the observed _ selective _ absorption ( i.e. , the variation of absorption as a function of wavelength ) is caused by _ dust particles _ that have sizes on the order of the ( optical ) wavelength of light .    the flux , @xmath8 measured by an observer at a distance @xmath9 of a source located at position @xmath10 , and whose flux at the earth , in the absence of extinction , is @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ( dimensionless ) optical - depth of the source along the path ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "the optical - depth is usually expressed in terms of the number volume density of the absorbing material @xmath14 , and the average extinction cross - section per particle , @xmath15 , ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) via the equation :    @xmath16    now , the absorption ( in magnitudes ) suffered by the light from this source is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the reddening to position @xmath10 , @xmath18 , is simply related to @xmath19 through the ratio of total - to - selective absorption , defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 refers to a specific color index , and @xmath22 refers to a fiducial wavelength ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "as is evident from the above expression , @xmath23 is determined _ only _ by the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient , and it is independent of position . becomes a weak function of spectral type ( gutirrez - moreno & moreno 1975 ) , see sect .",
    "( 16 ) ] since most applications have involved the johnson & morgan s ( 1953 ) b and v passbands , it is customary to define @xmath23 in terms of the reddening @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the observed ( reddened ) color of a star with intrinsic color @xmath27 . of course",
    ", any other passbands could be implemented this way ( provided that we know the extinction curve ) .",
    "we have adopted a value of @xmath28 equal to 3.2 ( mihalas & binney 1981 , scheffler 1982 , scheffler & elssser 1987 , although see sect .",
    "3.2 ) .",
    "parenago ( 1945 ) was the first to propose a functional variation for the reddening in the galactic plane ; he showed that an exponentially - decaying function away from the galactic plane provided an accurate description for the distribution of reddening material as derived from the ( photoelectric ) color excesses of around 3000 stars .",
    "his suggestion has been validated by later studies , most notably those of allen ( 1954 ) on the statistical distribution of different types of stars ( mainly wolf - rayet , o and a stars , and white dwarfs ) , and by ochsenbein s ( 1983 ) study of the z - distribution of am stars from the michigan spectral catalogue .",
    "more recent studies have found that the reddening per unit of distance ( which is proportional to @xmath29 ) , as derived from a complete sample of open clusters closer than 2  kpc follows an exponential decay as a function of height above the plane ( pandey & mahra 1987 ) , in agreement with the assumption that @xmath30 itself follows a vertical exponential distribution ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , and in agreement with earlier results by lyng ( 1982 ) from a more restricted sample of open clusters .",
    "following parenago , we assume that the ( large - scale ) volume ( particle ) density of the absorbing material , @xmath30 , follows a decaying exponential away from the galactic plane , as given by :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the scale - height of the reddening material defining the large - scale distribution of reddening material in a slab of exponential thickness @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the distance from the galactic plane of an object with heliocentric distance @xmath9 and galactic latitude @xmath35 , and @xmath6 is the distance of the sun from the galactic plane .",
    "there have been several determinations for the scale - height of the reddening material . in parenago s ( 1945 )",
    "pioneer work , he found a practically constant value for @xmath32 equal to @xmath36 .",
    "more recently , lyng ( 1982 ) found equally probable the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , although the results of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) toward the galactic poles ( which imply @xmath39 ) would favor the smaller value with lyng s adopted value of @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "pandey & mahra ( 1987 ) found @xmath42 from their complete sample of nearby open clusters .",
    "additional evidence comes from direct measurements of the thickness of both neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and carbon monoxide ( co ) in the galactic disk .",
    "it is known that @xmath24 is approximately proportional to the neutral hydrogen column density ( heiles 1976 [ particularly his fig .",
    "13a , and references therein ] , burstein & heiles 1978 [ particularly their fig .",
    "1a ] ) , therefore the thickness of the reddening material should be approximately well sampled by the distribution of hi itself .",
    "different studies ( scheffler & elssser 1987 ) have obtained thicknesses of about 130 to 150 pc from measurements of cold diffuse hi . on the other hand , spitzer ( 1978 ) estimates that @xmath43 from the statistical properties of the dust layer within 1 kpc of the sun",
    ". finally , since the correlation @xmath24 _ vs. _ @xmath44 involves a gas - to - dust ratio , it would seem reasonable to expect that @xmath24 is related also to the distribution of molecular material . from a compilation of different co surveys ( solomon et al .",
    "1979 , table 1 ) , we find @xmath45 , while from their own co survey of giant molecular clouds they find @xmath46 . as a compromise value between all these different determinations ,",
    "we have assumed in our reddening model a scale - height of 110  pc .      for intermediate - to - high galactic latitudes ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "reddening through `` infinity '' has been estimated by using burstein & heiles ( 1982 , bh thereafter ) reddening maps ( available in computer - readable form ) .",
    "these reddening estimates are used in our model to compute the reddening via the equation :    @xmath48    where r is the heliocentric distance for a point with galactic coordinates ( l , b ) , and @xmath49 is the reddening at `` @xmath50 '' from the bh maps . equation ( 4 ) has been derived by performing the line - of - sight integration to heliocentric distance r on our assumed density law for the absorbing material ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) , as required by eq .",
    "it should be noted that , if the sun is located in the plane of symmetry of the galaxy , then eq . ( 4 )",
    "reduces to the simpler case @xmath51 , valid for any value of the galactic latitude ( as long as @xmath47 ) .",
    "since the bh maps do not cover the entire sky , for regions where there is no data available , we have adopted sandage s ( 1972 ) modified cosecant law , given by :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the absorption , at infinity , that goes into eq .",
    "( 4 ) , after conversion to @xmath49 using our adopted value of @xmath28 . following sandage ,",
    "the above expression is only applied for @xmath54 , while it is assumed that @xmath55 at higher latitudes .",
    "sandage s law , based on an earlier model proposed by mcclure & crawford ( 1971 ) , has been extensively criticized by de vaucoleurs & buta ( 1983 ) .",
    "de vaucoleurs & buta find , on the basis of galaxy and galaxy clusters counts that a simple cosecant law ( as derived from a plane - parallel absorbing layer , dufay 1954 ) applies all the way to the poles , with a polar extinction of 0.2 magnitudes in @xmath56",
    ". de vaucoleurs & buta also back their findings by considering the surface brightness , the hydrogen - luminosity ratio , and the integrated color indices of galaxies on the second reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( de vaucoleurs et al . 1976 ) .",
    "de vaucoleurs & buta furthermore criticized sandage s law on the basis that it implies that the sun is located in the common apex of two opposite dust - free cones centered at the galactic poles ( see fig .  1 on de vaucoleurs & buta ) .",
    "sandage s law , on the other hand , agrees with the very small color excesses found for stars and globular clusters at high galactic latitudes . in fig .  1",
    "we show a comparison between the de vaucoleurs & buta s and sandage s law with the longitude - averaged run of reddening from the bh maps . from this figure , it is clear that sandage s law is a better representation of the actual variation of reddening as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "the discrepancy between sandage s ( zero - reddening ) model and the bh maps for @xmath57 is not relevant in this context , as most of the missing points from the bh maps ocurr at smaller galactic latitudes ( except for the region @xmath58 and @xmath59 where no data is available from the bh maps ) .",
    "figure  1 also clearly shows that , at high galactic latitudes , neither of the two laws seem to be a good representation of the bh maps .",
    "indeed , knude ( 1996 ) has recently found , from the color excesses derived from strmgren photometry for a complete sample of a3-g0 stars brighter than @xmath60 and with @xmath61 , that the north galactic pole exhibits a complex reddening distribution , with zonal variations ( in latitude and longitude ) which can be represented more by what he calls a slightly frosted window. this shows that _ any _ functional representation for the total reddening , even at high galactic latitudes , has to be taken with caution .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that knude finds a very good agreement between the zero - point on the bh maps ( derived from colors of rr  lyrae and individual stars in globular clusters ) and that derived by knude s uvbyh@xmath62 photometry of individual stars towards _ both _ the south and north galactic poles .",
    "the adequacy of the interpolation scheme described above has been demonstrated recently by mndez & van altena ( 1996 ) , by performing _",
    "simultaneous _ fits to the magnitude and color counts for two intermediate - latitude fields located at @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the amount and distribution of the reddening material is important for both the starcounts ( where reddening affects the total number of objects in a given field - of - view ) as well as the color - counts ( where reddening affects the color distribution of stars ) .",
    "the comparisons performed by mndez & van altena indicate that , indeed , the exponential approximation gives a very good fit to the star- and color - counts towards these two fields having moderate extinction ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the two fields - of - view respectively ) .",
    "we should also point out that the use of eq .",
    "( 4 ) for the case @xmath67  pc is not new : it was proposed , e.g. , by van herk ( 1965 ) in his study of the motions and space distribution of rr  lyrae stars , and it has been subsequently used in different contexts where an accurate statistical determination of the reddening is needed ( e.g. , di  benedetto & rabbia 1987 , fouqu & gieren 1996 ) . indeed , di  benedetto & rabbia ( 1987 ) have pointed out that van herk s model yields the same reddening estimates as those derived from the method of color - excess described by savage & mathis ( 1979 ) when using a scale - height of 100  pc , close to our adopted value ( sect .",
    "finally , jnch - srensen ( 1994 ) has investigated the reddening in six fields with @xmath68 up to distances of 10  kpc using uvbyh@xmath62 photometry .",
    "he finds quite a good agreement in the run of reddening with distance compared to that predicted by a simple exponential model similar to that of eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( see , e.g , his fig .  5 ) , although he warns that simply adopting @xmath49 from the bh maps yields systematically lower reddening than observed , except for the fields with the smaller reddening values .",
    "the largest difference found among the six fields studied by jnch - srensen amounts to 0.15  mag in @xmath24 , with a mean difference for the six regions of @xmath69  mag .",
    "this underestimation is partially a volume - sampling effect , because of the coarse angular resolution of the bh maps ( derived from hi observations with a beam size of @xmath70 ) in comparison with the sizes of the fields studies by jnch - srensen ( smaller than @xmath71 ) . indeed , as pointed out by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , their maps should be an accurate representation of the reddening in the galaxy in regions where the variation of reddening with position is small over the angular resolution of the maps . evidently , for specific applications ( e.g , those involving small fields - of - view ) , the reddening should be determined either from multi - color photometry or from the magnitude and color counts , as done by mndez & van altena ( 1996 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , in the study by mndez & van altena ( 1996 ) , involving two regions of about @xmath72 each , their derived reddening values are systematically _ lower _ than those from the bh maps in an amount of 0.012  mag for their ngc  188 field , and 0.042  mag for their ngc  3680 field .      for low - latitudes ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "we have used published reddening maps giving @xmath24 _ vs. _ heliocentric distance and galactic position .",
    "the main optical surveys devoted to the study of the spatial distribution of interstellar reddening material in the solar neighborhood have been those of fitzgerald ( 1968 , 1974 , 1987 , collectively called fg hereafter ) , fitzgerald & reed ( 1991 ) , and neckel & klare ( 1980 , nk hereafter ) , with a number of other more restricted surveys ( deutschman et al .",
    "1976 , forbes 1985 , pandey & mahra 1987 ) . in this study",
    "we have only included the reddening determinations by fg and nk .",
    "fg s maps include a number of regions with @xmath73 , while nk s maps are restricted to the range @xmath74 , both studies cover the range @xmath75 .    since no computer - readable form existed for either fg s nor nk s maps , we had to read - off their adopted mean reddening curves directly from the figures in their publications ( we should note that , given the resolution of the maps presented by fg and nk , we estimate a `` reading '' uncertainty of about 0.03  mag in @xmath24 , while the quoted errors for the reddening from the fg and nk maps are 0.015  mag and 0.031 to 0.063  mag respectively ) .",
    "this involved the key - punching of reddening maps for 75 lines - of - sight from fg s regions , and 316 lines - of - sight from nk s regions .",
    "each line - of - sight consists itself of `` node points '' at different heliocentric distances .",
    "therefore , our low - latitude grid consists of 388 lines - of - sight ( three lines - of - sight were duplicated in both studies ) , with 1,263 independent node points covering the whole galactic plane with @xmath1 .",
    "the average angular resolution in galactic longitude is therefore around @xmath76 , but there are fluctuations in this number due to the selective study of certain regions by both authors .",
    "figure  2 shows the distribution of node points with respect to the sun , projected onto the plane of the galaxy ( see also fig . 4 in fitzgerald 1968 , fig .",
    "9a in nk , and fig .  4 below ) .    in fig",
    "3 we show a comparison between fg s and nk s maps for the three directions in common between these two studies .",
    "nk s values of @xmath41 have been converted to @xmath24 using his adopted value of @xmath77 .",
    "we can see that , at @xmath78 , there is a good agreement between fg s and nk s values for @xmath79 , however there is an asymptotic difference in @xmath24 of @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "the agreement at @xmath82 is however very good at all distances ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "finally , at @xmath84 , even though there is a good agreement for @xmath85 , fg s map shows a faster increase at small distances ( @xmath86 ) and then it remains constant up to @xmath87 , whereas nk s map indicates a reddening approximately a factor of three bigger than fg s value .",
    "for these three directions we have chosen nk s values over those of fg .",
    "the general agreement of these maps at small distances ( @xmath88 ) is important , because most of the bright to intermediate magnitude counts come from stars located at similar heliocentric distances .",
    "however , the noted discrepancies at large distances imply that the adoption of these mean - extinction curves has to be taken with caution , specially when trying to evaluate the reddening at large heliocentric distances .    in the following section we describe the interpolation scheme used to obtain reddening at positions other than those specified in fg s and nk s reddening maps .        if the galactic latitude of the point for which reddening is sought is such that @xmath89 , an interpolation scheme has been devised that assumes that the distribution of reddening material presents both a `` smooth '' component represented by an exponential distribution of dust perpendicular to the galactic plane ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) , and a `` clumpy '' component that represents the fragmentary nature of individual molecular clouds along the line of sight , represented by the available reddening maps . to accommodate for poorly sampled directions in the plane ,",
    "the bh reddening maps at @xmath90 are dynamically incorporated in the interpolation .",
    "this also ensures a continuous transition to higher latitudes .    if @xmath91 are the heliocentric distance and the galactic position of the point for which reddening is sought ( the `` target '' ) , the ( combined ) fg and nk reddening maps are searched for the two node points in longitude that enclose the target longitude .",
    "then , at those two longitudes , the two latitudes that enclose the target latitude are searched for .",
    "this search procedure may yield up to four node points enclosing the target point . then , at each enclosing node point , the reddening at distance @xmath92 is interpolated linearly in distance from the respective reddening maps . in this linear interpolation , if the target distance is smaller than the first node point for a particular reddening map , the value is interpolated assuming zero reddening at zero distance and the reddening associated with the first distance point in the reddening map . on the other hand ,",
    "if the target distance is greater than the last node point , the reddening is _ extrapolated _ , as described in the following subsection .",
    "in addition to the four nearby points , the reddening at heliocentric distance @xmath92 , galactic longitude @xmath93 , and galactic latitudes of @xmath94 is computed from the bh reddening maps . these reddening values are used mainly for the intermediate region @xmath95 , where fg s and nk s reddening maps do not constrain the reddening very well , and to provide a smooth transition to higher galactic latitudes .",
    "we have attempted two different approaches to obtain the reddening at distances beyond the last node point .",
    "first , we have tried assuming a constant value of absorption per unit of distance ( e.g. , @xmath96 in @xmath41 ) , and using the last node point as a zero - point , i.e. :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the reddening for the last distance node located at @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the adopted absorption per unit of distance .",
    "this extrapolation approach is similar to that adopted in the extinction model by arenou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we shall call this model - a .",
    "this model , which is quite common ( see sect 2.6.1 ) , has two main drawbacks .",
    "first , as we shall see below ( eq .",
    "15 ) , the absorption in the solar vicinity has a galactic longitude dependence near the plane , and therefore it is not correct , in principle , to assume a constant value for the differential reddening .",
    "however , since this value is applied only after the last reddening point ( typically located at heliocentric distances of 3  to 4  kpc ( fig .",
    "2 ) ) , we can view the term @xmath100 as a _ residual reddening _ , with a minor effect on the bright starcounts discussed below , which are dominated by stars located at distances of about 1  to 2  kpc ( see sect 3.3 ) , whereas the term @xmath98 not only sets the zero - point , but also determines the galactic longitude dependence .",
    "the second shortcoming of this approach is that , at large heliocentric distances and @xmath101 , this model assumes a constant value of reddening for stars situated many ( reddening ) scale - heights from the disk , leading therefore to an excess on the predicted reddening .",
    "this problem has been alleviated in the model by arenou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) by adopting zero differential reddening beyond a heliocentric distance such that the corresponding distance from the galactic plane is larger than the adopted scale - height of the reddening material .",
    "the second extrapolation scheme ( model - b ) comes from insisting on the functional form of the large - scale distribution of the reddening material presented in sect .",
    "2.2 , and from using , again , the last reddening point , but this time as a scale factor ( rather than as a zero - point ) for the extrapolation .",
    "if @xmath102 is the last reddening point , it is possible to show that the extrapolated reddening to an heliocentric distance @xmath92 ( with @xmath103 is given by , but similar expressions can be written for @xmath104 . ] :    @xmath105    we note that the above expression does not diverge for @xmath106 , in this case the extrapolated reddening is given by @xmath107 . by comparing this simple expression with eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we see that a linear extrapolation is indeed a special case of eq .",
    "( 7 ) for @xmath106 if we identify @xmath100 with @xmath108 . in model - b ,",
    "the galactic longitude dependency is , of course , built - into @xmath102 , and the decrease of reddening beyond the scale - height of the obscuring material is fully taken into account . the main problem with this model comes from the fact that , since @xmath102 acts as a scale - factor ( rather than as a zero - point as it was the case on eq . ( 6 ) ) , the extrapolated reddening is extremely sensitive to uncertainties in the last reddening point which , being located at large heliocentric distances , is subject to a greater uncertainty than the node points located at smaller heliocentric distances , a point clearly demonstrated by fig .  3 ( see also discussion at end of sect .",
    "2.4 ) . in sects . 2.6.1 and 2.6.2",
    "we fully compare the results of adopting either model , and its impact on the predicted reddening .",
    "once the reddening of the four adjacent node points has been found , the reddening at the target is found through a _ weighted _ mean of the reddening from those four node points , plus the scaled reddening values from the bh maps . if @xmath109 ( i=1 ... 4 ) are the assigned weights to the four enclosing reddening points with reddening @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are the weights assigned to the bh reddening values at @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively , then the interpolated reddening is computed via :    @xmath115    where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the values derived from the bh reddening maps ( eq . ( 4 ) ) , at @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "we have incorporated the clumpy nature of the absorbing material , as well as its large - scale properties , through a proper selection of the weights specified in eq .",
    "the weights @xmath118 are given by :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 are the galactic longitude and latitude of the i - th node point , @xmath121 are the weights that describe the large - scale variation of the reddening material , @xmath122 is a function that considers the patchy distribution of reddening material , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the linear and angular distances between the corresponding node points and the target respectively .",
    "the weights @xmath121 have two components , a latitude component , @xmath125 , and a longitude component , @xmath126 , both of which are described below .",
    "the large - scale component of the weights is thus given by @xmath127 .",
    "the weights @xmath125 are computed by taking the ratio of the expected value for the reddening at position @xmath91 , and the expected value at the respective node position .",
    "effectively this ratio scales the ( observed ) reddening value at the node point to that at the target location .",
    "this is achieved by using our assumed density law for the dust particles ( eq . ( 2 ) )",
    "integrated over the appropriate line - of - sight ( eq .",
    "the weights @xmath125 are thus given by :    @xmath128    where the function @xmath129 is computed as , but similar expressions can be written for @xmath104 . ] :    @xmath130    for example , if @xmath131 , the weights @xmath125 ( for _ any _ value of @xmath92 , @xmath35 , and @xmath132 ) take the very simple expression :    @xmath133    note also that , for @xmath106 , @xmath129 does not diverge , but it approaches the ratio @xmath134 which corresponds to a linear increase of reddening with distance ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) , and comments following eq . ( 7 ) ) .",
    "indeed , this is the only possible asymptotic solution for an exponential layer , as @xmath35 goes to zero .",
    "in addition to the galactic - latitude ( or height above the plane ) dependence of the weights , we have implemented also a longitude dependence . from a study of classical cepheids , fernie ( 1968 ) found that the reddening exhibits a cyclic ( sinusoidal ) variation with galactic longitude at @xmath106 , while pandey & mahra ( 1987 ) found a similar behavior for @xmath89 from a sample of 462 open clusters with known color excesses and ( photometric ) distances . for the cyclic variation represented by @xmath135 , fernie ( 1968 ) found @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 from cepheids located at heliocentric distances closer than 6 kpc .",
    "pandey & mahra ( 1987 ) found a maximum absorption at @xmath139 , and a minimum absorption at @xmath140 , for @xmath141 ( where their sample of open clusters is not extremely biased ) , in accordance with fernie s value for @xmath142 .",
    "lyng ( 1979 , 1982 ) also found a maximum average interstellar absorption toward @xmath143 , based on a study of b stars , classical cepheids , and open clusters .",
    "based on fernie s results , our weights in galactic longitude , @xmath126 , have been defined as :    @xmath144    since fernie s relationship seems to pertain only to the local distribution of reddening material , the weights given in eq .",
    "( 15 ) are only applied for distances smaller than 6 kpc .    as for the function @xmath145 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we have tried different functional forms , and we have chosen the one that minimizes the reddening residuals of the observed _ vs. _ predicted node point in a self - consistent way , as described in sect .",
    "the purpose of introducing this function has been to take into account the discrete nature of the individual clouds and the patchy distribution of the interstellar dust by weighting the node points according to its proximity to the target location .",
    "we should note that , since the bh reddening maps are evaluated at @xmath146 ) , then eq .  ( 11 ) becomes @xmath147 , where the + sign applies to the node point with reddening @xmath116 ( with weight @xmath111 ) , while the - sign applies to the node point with reddening @xmath117 ( with weight @xmath112 ) from the bh maps . also , for the bh reddening values we do not apply any galactic longitude variation component to the weights ( which are applicable only to @xmath148 ) , but only the latitude dependence ( eq . ( 12 ) ) .",
    "overshoot and undershoot in latitude in those cases where the target latitude is bigger or smaller respectively than the biggest and smallest latitude on the reddening arrays is taken care of by considering only the closest latitude point with the proper weight",
    ". therefore the interpolation is set up to work with a maximum of six points ( four node points from the low - latitude reddening maps , and two node points from the bh maps ) to a minimum of four points ( two node points from the low - latitude reddening maps , and two node points from the bh maps ) .",
    "note that in cases of over / undershoot we extrapolate in latitude using our exponential reddening model described above .",
    "since reddening data is available in the whole range @xmath149 , there is never over / undershoot in longitude .",
    "it should be noticed that , with the weighting scheme described above , the role of the bh maps , even at low galactic latitudes , is quite important .",
    "for example , for a target point at @xmath150 with a node point at @xmath151 , the weights applied to the node point and the values from the bh maps at @xmath152 are 0.91 , 1.84 , and 1.37 correspondingly , where we have adopted for @xmath145 an inverse - linear relationship ( see sect .",
    "2.6 ) , @xmath153  pc , and @xmath154  pc . in cases",
    "where the target location is enclosed by four node points from the fg or nk maps , one might not use the bh maps , and could perform an interpolation using only those node points .",
    "however , due to the relatively poor angular sampling of the current maps ( see sect .  2.4 and fig .  2 ) it seldom occurs that a target is surrounded by four node points , and therefore this is not a problem for the current implementation of the model , but it could become important as the density of node points increases through the incorporation of more reddening maps in our database .    a simpler approach , but similar to that of eq .",
    "( 8) , has been used recently by layden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the context of statistical parallaxes for rr  lyrae stars .",
    "indeed , this is yet another possible use of our starcounts & kinematic model , which we intend to pursue in the future .",
    "the following procedure has been adopted to estimate the expected uncertainty in the interpolated reddening values : the reddening has been computed at each node point for a given longitude ( a `` longitude slice '' ) from the two adjacent node points in longitude , and the root - mean - square ( rms ) residual between the predicted value and the observed one has been obtained for each of those longitude slices .",
    "our reddening maps have 276 independent longitude slices .",
    "each longitude slice may contain more than one latitude node ( although it has , typically , only one latitude point at @xmath148 ) and , at each latitude , there may be node points at more than one heliocentric distance .",
    "this scheme is similar to the way in which reddening is computed for a line - of - sight integration in our starcounts model ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , and therefore it provides a realistic description of the accuracy of our reddening model .    using the above procedure we can examine the residuals between our model predictions and the observed values at each node point in the reddening maps in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this allows us to `` tune - up '' the adopted parameters , as well as the exact distance weighting scheme in the reddening model ( the term @xmath145 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) , so as to minimize the scatter between the predicted and observed values . in the following two subsections we deal , separately , with the models - a and  b described in subsection  2.5.2 ( eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and  ( 7 ) ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the residuals ( in the sense @xmath155 ) as a function of galactic latitude , longitude , and heliocentric distance for model - a .",
    "figures 4a - b provide and indication of the angular sampling with the reddening maps implemented in the current version of our reddening model , it also shows that we do not have any obvious systematic trend in the predicted residuals as a function of either galactic latitude or longitude .",
    "figure 4c shows , on the other hand , an upward trend in the residuals _ vs. _ distance , particularly for @xmath156 .",
    "this is caused by a value of @xmath100 beyond the last node point that is too large .",
    "the value of @xmath100 used in fig .",
    "4c was @xmath96 .",
    "table 1 indicates the dispersion in the reddening model as a function of @xmath100 .",
    "the best value for @xmath157 , obtained from a minimization of the residuals as a function of this parameter , gives @xmath158 , which for a value of @xmath159 corresponds to only @xmath160 of reddening beyond @xmath161 .",
    "this value is considerably _ smaller _ than previous determinations of @xmath162 , which yielded values closer to @xmath163 .",
    "for example , van herk ( 1965 ) adopted a value of 1.9  mag / kpc ( for @xmath164 ) , and di benedetto & rabbia ( 1987 ) a value of 1.4  mag / kpc . on the other hand , lyng ( 1982 ) adopted a value of @xmath40 from an statistical study of a sample of open clusters .",
    "more recently , blackwell et al . (",
    "1990 ) have discussed the evidence for even smaller values of @xmath100 from the _ local _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath165  pc ) distribution of reddening material around the sun , adopting in the end an absorption of 0.6  mag / kpc , quite close to our derived value .",
    "we should note , however , that those determinations were concerned with _",
    "local _ reddening , while our value is determined mainly from the more distant node points ( further than 2 kpc from the sun ) .",
    "figure  4d shows the residuals _ vs. _ distance for @xmath166 ( figs .",
    "4a - b were produced with this value of @xmath157 as well ) .",
    "the residuals _ vs. _ distance vary slowly with @xmath100 and , as a result , our minimum is rather shallow .",
    "this is because a large fraction of the residual is produced by the nearby points that are not sensitive to the actual value of @xmath100 .",
    "however , the effect of different values of @xmath162 at large heliocentric distances is obvious in figs .",
    "4c - d .",
    "table 1 also indicates the effect of changing @xmath28 for the case when @xmath100 is fixed to 0.5  mag / kpc . the effect on the derived dispersion is minimal , even when changing @xmath28 by as much as 13% . in terms of residuals",
    ", there is very little difference when changing @xmath28 for @xmath167  3  4  kpc .",
    "the trend we find is that a larger @xmath28 predicts somewhat smaller model reddenings ( i.e. , a more negative residual ) for @xmath168 , thus allowing for a larger value of @xmath100 .",
    "this is expected , since the quantity of interest is actually the differential reddening , which is the ratio between @xmath100 and @xmath169 .",
    "the lack of sensitivity of the reddening model values to the exact value of @xmath28 is important in view of the rather large sensitivity of our model starcounts to this parameter , as shown in sect .",
    "figures 5a - b show the residuals _ vs. _ heliocentric distance for these two extreme values of @xmath28 , it is evident that the differences in the distribution of residuals is minimal .    we have also varied the values of @xmath32 and @xmath6 within considerable limits . since these parameters enter only in the `` smooth '' component of the weights , as described in sect .",
    "2.5.3 , they have a rather small impact on the computed residuals .",
    "table  1 lists our results for some extreme cases of these parameters , along with the computed dispersion .",
    "we find no clear trend in the reddening residuals _ vs. _ galactic position or heliocentric distance for different values of @xmath6 . for @xmath170",
    "there seems to be a small downward trend in the range @xmath171 and then a flattening at larger distances , while for @xmath172 there seems to be a small upward trend for @xmath173 , although these features are not very pronounced ( see figs .",
    "5c - d ) . as for the dependence on @xmath6 ( figs .",
    "5e - f ) , we find very little dependence on this parameter , with an indication of a slight upward trend for @xmath168 when @xmath174 . as a consequence",
    ", we can not constrain these parameters from these data alone .",
    "it is not surprising that this test is not sensitive , in particular , to @xmath32 because our node points are mostly located at @xmath148 , and therefore the dependence on height above / below the galactic plane is greatly reduced .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we have adopted the values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 , as indicated in sect .",
    "2.2 , and in mndez & van altena ( 1996 ) respectively .    as for the distance - weighting function @xmath145 in eq .",

    "the best result is obtained with the inverse - linear weight ( indeed , models  a-1 through  a-8 in table  1 were performed precisely with this weighting scheme , with the best inverse - linear solution being model  a-2 ) .",
    "the inverse - square , inverse - cubic , and exponentially - decaying weights exhibit an intrinsically larger scatter as a function of distance , and they also exhibit an upward trend in the residuals for distances larger than 4 kpc . since for these models we have already adopted a small value of @xmath100 it seems unlikely that this upward trend is the result of an inadequate value for this parameter , but rather it shows the inadequacy of these weights .",
    "we have also tried no - distance weights at all ( i.e. , @xmath178 ) . in this case",
    "( see table 1 , model  a-12 ) , the residuals are larger than for the inverse - distance weight and there is a small _ downward _ trend in the residuals _ vs. _ distance . by increasing the value of @xmath100 , as indicated in table 1 ( models  a-13 &  a-14 ) , the residuals do decrease slightly , but are still larger than for an inverse - linear weight . for values of @xmath179",
    "the residuals wiggle , going downwards in the range @xmath180 and then upwards for @xmath181 .",

    "are directly related to the column density of absorbing material , the fact that our best weighting scheme corresponds to that found by williams for isolated clouds indicates that the overall reddening is , _ on the mean _ , caused by clouds with the same density profiles as those studied by williams , with a typical core - radius ( our `` softening parameter '' ) close to 1 pc .",

    "the ratio of these two values should approach asymptotically to 1.25 ( meyer 1975 ) for a gaussian function , as it is indeed the case for our model .",

    "the last two columns in table  4 indicate the mean fractional difference between the observed and model starcounts , as well as the mean of the absolute dispersion , both with their standard deviation . it can be seen that , despite a reduction factor of up to 15 in the predicted counts from a model without reddening to a model including reddening , the ( absolute ) agreement is around 20% , with a mean value of 11% ( except in the case of region  6 at @xmath223 which will be discussed later ) .",

    "3.3 and  3.4 ) , there are other parameters that also have a large impact on the starcounts .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will still adopt our standard values of @xmath253  mag / kpc and @xmath254  pc .",
    "our starcounts model also includes an option for the extinction model by arenou et al .",

    "the discrepancies in the predicted starcounts between these two reddening models may be a consequence of the different approaches adopted : while arenou s et al .",

    "and the observed counts seem to be systematic and , therefore , even though their model leads to more precise starcounts , our model seems to lead to more accurate starcounts , in the classical statistical distinction between these two terms .",
    "we must emphasize that arenou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have adopted the mean @xmath28 as given in eq .",
    "( 17 ) above .",
    "since arenou s model is an extinction model , rather than a reddening model , we have to adopt an iterative procedure to solve for @xmath24 ( and thus @xmath255 ) from their model @xmath41 values and from the observed ( b - v ) .",
    "this was needed in order to compute starcounts with our model , and it is a consequence of the dependence of @xmath169 on both @xmath256 and @xmath24 .",
    "the iterative procedure converged quickly , in only two or three iterations .",
    "the discrepancy seen between the model predictions and region  6 at @xmath257 ( figs .",
    "13  15 ) is puzzling : on one hand the predicted reddening at 1  kpc is smaller than that of region  1 at @xmath258 ( table 3 ) , yet the observed number of stars in the latter is larger than that of the former , contrary to expectation . on the other hand , region  6 should exhibit a higher stellar density than that of region  1 ( before any reddening correction ) because of the exponentially decaying stellar density profile away from the galactic center ( this is indeed seen in the model excluding reddening on fig . 12 and table 4 , run  1 ) .",
    "these two facts combined , point to a problem with the particular gsc plate in region  6 , rather than to a deficiency of the model .",
    "it is possible that due to the very high degree of crowding toward this line of sight , only a subset of all images were included in the gsc in order to maintain a good magnitude coverage ( one of the gsc requirements was to provide a uniform stellar density over the sky , rather than a uniform magnitude limit , so that at lower galactic latitudes the gsc becomes incomplete at brighter magnitudes than for higher galactic latitudes ( jenkner et al .",
    "an investigation of this particular plate is currently being carried out to determine the actual nature of the discrepancy seen in figs .",

    "( 4),(7 ) , and ( 13 ) it is clear that the value of @xmath6 will have an impact on the predicted reddening .",
    "indeed , this parameter will have an important effect , even if there is no reddeding , as it controls the viewing aspect when looking at the galactic plane at positions slightly above or below it .",
    "therefore , its effect is twofold : it changes the predicted value of @xmath24 , but it also changes the density contribution of the different types of stars that make up the starcounts model .",
    "table  5 indicates the predicted reddening for a model with the same parameters as that for run  3 in table  4 , but for values of @xmath259 and @xmath260 ( instead of the standard value @xmath261 adopted in runs  1 to  9 of table  4 ) .",

    "this solution seems incompatible with the gsc low - latitude optical starcounts presented here .",
    "indeed , starcount studies at the galactic poles indicate that the sun is _ above _ the galactic plane ( as defined by the distribution of neutral hydrogen ) , e.g. , humphreys & larsen ( 1995 ) find @xmath267 from a comparison of the asymmetry in the starcounts towards the north and south galactic poles .    we have also varied the adopted value of @xmath268  kpc within a wide margin , between 7  kpc and 10  kpc .",
    "the effect of these self - similar galaxy models on the starcounts is minimal , as it can be seen in table  5 , with no salient features in the shape of the predicted starcounts .",
    "this is a consequence of the relatively small distance range covered by these bright starcounts , limited typically to heliocentric distances smaller than about 2  kpc .",
    "the structural parameters discussed previously affect _ all _ the stellar populations simultaneously .",
    "however , there are still a few population - dependent parameters in the starcount model that have an impact on the starcounts : these are the population scale - heights and scale - lengths .",
    "figure  17 shows the effect of varying the exponential scale - length for the disk ( @xmath7 ) between 2.5  kpc and 4.5  kpc .",
    "the effect on the counts is highly dependent on projection effects , and thus regions  1 and  6 are the most affected by changes in this parameter , along with region  3 at the fainter magnitudes , all these regions being close to the center - anticenter direction .",

    "another important application in the works is the use of our model to compute the distance distribution of stars self - consistently with the starcounts , in order to derive corrections to absolute parallax ( van altena 1974 , 1986 , van altena et al .",

    "it is clear from the analysis presented in this paper that the problem is , by nature , multi - variate , and that a number of parameters must be adjusted to a set of observables simultaneously .",

    "a related issue is , of course , the choice of optimum algorithms to arrive at the best overall solution .",
