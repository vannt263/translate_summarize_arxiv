    "figures  [ figallqso ] and [ figallqsosub ] tell the main story of this paper .",
    "we urge the reader to look at these beautiful @xmath1 images before continuing with the text and the quantitative details .",
    "we summarize in this paper the results of our analysis of @xmath1-wfpc2 observations of a representative sample of 20 of the most luminous ( m@xmath2 ) nearby ( @xmath3 ) quasars .",
    "the goal of these observations was to help understand the quasar phenomenon by determining the environment in which quasars occur .",
    "the main result of this paper is that there is not one type of environment , but instead a wide range of environments in which the most luminous quasars appear to be embedded .",
    "the @xmath1 images also contain a number of extraordinary phenomena and some surprises , including : host galaxies that appear normal and show no evidence of strong gravitational interactions , very close galactic companions , host ellipticals for radio quiet quasars , spiral hosts with well developed arms and prominent h  ii regions , galaxies caught in the act of merging , apparently faint galactic hosts , and very extended emission .",
    "some partial results of this study have been reported previously : bahcall et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 , 1995a , b , c , 1996 ) .",
    "for those aspects of the work that depend upon the subtraction of a stellar point spread function ( psf ) , there are small , quantitative differences between the results described in this paper and previous results we have reported . in the previous work",
    ", we used a stellar psf determined from a red standard star , f141 . in the present work ,",
    "we have used stellar psfs that were obtained for four separate blue stars ( see discussion in section  [ aftersub ] of the psfs constructed by krist and burrows 1996 ) .",
    "the visual appearance of the hosts in the subtracted images is , in a few cases , significantly improved by using the psfs of the blue stars .",
    "other @xmath1 studies of quasar imaging ( although many of the objects do not satisfy our luminosity criterion ) include hutchings & morris ( 1995 ) , hutchings et al . , ( 1994 ) , and disney et al .",

    "the analyses described in these pioneering ground - based studies are made difficult because of atmospheric seeing ; the light from the bright central ( nuclear ) sources may be a few magnitudes brighter than the total emission from the host galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , there is agreement ( within typically one magnitude or better ) between our @xmath1 observations and previous ground - based estimates of the total apparent magnitudes of the host emission , although @xmath1 reveals details not previously accessible and corrects some important conjectures that are not supported by the higher - resolution observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ obssection ]",
    "we describe the sample selection and observations ; in section  [ subunproc ] we present the unprocessed data ; in section  [ aftersub ] we describe the method of removing the light due to the quasar ( point spread function subtraction ) and present the data after a stellar psf is subtracted ; in section  [ anasection ] we describe the methods of analysis of the data ; in section  [ secsize ] we report on the measurements of the host galaxies ; in section  [ companion ] we discuss the presence of companion galaxies ; in section  [ groundsection ] we compare our measurements with results from some ground - based observations ; in section  [ comments ] we comment on the environment and host galaxy of each quasar , and in section  [ discuss ] we summarize and discuss our results .",

    "we describe in this section how the sample was selected (   [ subsample ] ) and how the observations were performed (   [ subobs ] ) .",
    "a sample of 14 quasars was selected solely on the basis of luminosity ( @xmath6 ) , redshift ( @xmath7 ) , and galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "all the quasars in the vron - cetty & vron  ( 1991 ) catalog that satisfied the redshift , luminosity , and galactic latitude criteria were included in this sample ; no distinction was made on the basis of radio or other secondary properties .",
    "one may choose to call this set of quasars a `` complete sample '' within the context of the vron - cetty & vron  ( 1991 ) catalog .",
    "the 14 quasars with @xmath9 have an average ( median ) absolute magnitude @xmath10 and an average redshift @xmath11 .",
    "only 3 radio loud quasars are present in the original sample of 14 objects . in the vron - cetty and vron ( 1996 ) catalog , there are an additional 4 quasars with @xmath12 that satisfy our luminosity and galactic latitudes requirements ; all are radio quiet .    by combining the time available from gto and go programs , an additional 6 quasars with redshift between @xmath13 were added to the original sample of 14 objects ; these additional objects satisfied the same luminosity and galactic latitude constraints as the original sample .",
    "the additional objects contain 3 radio loud quasars ; the total sample of 20 contains 6 quasars that are classified as radio loud , i.e. with @xmath14 ( kellermann et al .",
    "the additional 6 objects are slightly brighter in the optical on the average ( median ) , @xmath15 , and have slightly larger redshifts , @xmath16 .",
    "the range of absolute magnitudes in the 6 added objects , @xmath17 , is included within the range of absolute magnitudes spanned by the original sample of 14 objects , i.e. , @xmath18 .    in what follows",
    ", we shall refer to the total sample of 20 quasars as a `` representative sample '' with @xmath19 and @xmath3 .",
    "the average ( median ) absolute magnitude for the full sample is @xmath20 ; the average redshift @xmath21 .",
    "nearly all ( 18 ) of the quasars have @xmath22 , but two are much brighter in the optical band : 3c  273 ( @xmath23 ) and he  1029@xmath24140 ( @xmath25 ) .      a journal of the observations is given in table  [ journal ] , which lists the following quantities for each object : the date observed , the longest exposure time of a single image , the detected number of @xmath26 in the sky , the quasar redshift , the distance in kiloparsecs that corresponds to an angular separation of 1  as seen from earth , the apparent @xmath27-magnitude ( from vron - cetty & vron 1996 ) , the absolute @xmath27-magnitude ( without k - correction ) , the radio properties ( an `` x '' identifies the radio loud quasars ) , and in the last column the existence of @xmath1 spectroscopy ( a `` k '' indicates that the @xmath1/fos observations were taken as part of the @xmath1 quasar absorption line key project , and some of the results are reported by bahcall et al .",

    "the quasars were observed with the wide field / planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) through the f606w filter , which is similar to the @xmath27  bandpass but is slightly redder ; the mean wavelength and fwhm of the f606w system response are 5935    and 1500   , respectively .",
    "the f606w filter was chosen because of its high throughput . in all of the quasars discussed here ,",
    "redshifted @xmath28 and [ o  iii ] are included in the bandpass . at a given angular radius ,",
    "the scattered light in the wide field camera-2 ( wf ) is about five times less than the scattered light in the planetary camera ( see krist & burrows 1994 ) .",
    "we chose to use the wf instead of the pc in the original formulation of this program because of the likelihood that the host galaxies would have low surface brightnesses that extended over areas large compared to the wf resolution ( @xmath29 or about 0.2 kpc ) .",
    "the results reported here support the original choices , since the observed galaxy extensions are indeed large compared to the wf resolution .",
    "the center of light of all quasars was placed within @xmath30  from the center of the wide - field camera ccd  3 ( wf3 ) .",
    "three exposures were taken of each quasar .",
    "the integration times for 14 objects were 1400  s , 500  s , and 200  s ; the exposures for the remaining six objects were 1100  s , 600  s , and 100  s.    the size of wf3 is @xmath31 pixels ( exposed area @xmath32 pixels ) and its image scale is 00996  pixel@xmath33 .",

    "additional details of the observational procedures are given in paper  i and paper  ii .",
    "the innermost regions of the quasar images are saturated in all of the longest exposures out to a radius @xmath35 , except for the the two optically brightest quasars in our sample , he  1029@xmath24140 and 3c  273 , in which cases the images were saturated out to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the number of saturated pixels in the central region of the quasar images were typically 30 pixels for the longest exposures .",
    "in addition , @xmath38 saturated pixels were present due to the `` vertical bleeding '' .",
    "for he  1029@xmath24140 and 3c  273 , the number of saturated pixels was approximately 105 and 190 , respectively , plus 90 and 390 from the vertical bleeding .",
    "the initial data processing ( bias frame removal and flat - field calibration ) was performed at the space telescope science institute with their standard software package .",
    "the individual images of each quasar were aligned to better than 0.3  pixel ; this made it easy to identify and eliminate cosmic ray events .",
    "cosmic rays were identified by a pixel - by - pixel comparison of pairs of images ; the intensity of a pixel containing a cosmic ray was replaced by the scaled value of the intensity of the pixel in the other image .",
    "the flat - field corrections were based upon pre - flight calibrations ; these calibrations remove the small - scale ( few pixel ) sensitivity variations . the typical signal and rms of the noise of the sky in the long exposures ( in detected photons per pixel ) are 157 and 14 , respectively .",
    "the sky level corresponds to an average surface brightness of approximately @xmath39  mag  arcsec@xmath40 .",

    "the exposure time of the star image shown in the top panel of figure  [ figallqso ] is 20  s , which yields a total number of counts similar to that obtained in the quasar images .",

    "there are three obvious cases of current gravitational interaction : 0316@xmath24346 , pg  1012@xmath45008 , and pks  2349@xmath24014 .",
    "some of the host galaxies are seen even in our shortest exposures ( 200  s , see bahcall et al .",
    "1996 for short exposure images of pg  0052@xmath45251 and phl  909 ) . in some cases ,",
    "like nab  0205@xmath4502 , pg  0953@xmath45414 , and pg  1307@xmath45085 , it is difficult to distinguish the quasar image from the star even in our longest exposures .",
    "the major challenge in the analysis of these @xmath1 data is the removal of the light produced by the quasar , which is presumed to be a point source .",
    "we have adopted an empirical approach .",
    "we have used images of stars observed at the same location on the detector as the quasars to determine the point - spread function , psf , of the stellar quasar .",
    "for about half of the quasars considered here , the principal observational results concerning the host environment can be obtained without the psf subtraction .",
    "examples of exceptions are the hosts of nab  0205@xmath4502 , pg  0953 + 414 , pg  1444@xmath45407 , and 3c  323.1 , which are more apparent in figure  [ figallqsosub ] than in figure  [ figallqso ] .",

    ", a series of four images were used by krist and burrows ( 1996 ) to produce a psf that samples the full dynamic range of the star image and covers the saturation range found in the quasar images . in these calibration images ,",
    "the radius of the saturated region varies from @xmath53 to @xmath54 ; the exposure times range from @xmath55  s to @xmath56  s.    the psf data are publicly available at http://www.sns.ias.edu/jnb .",
    "there is detailed documentation regarding the psf data and their use at this site ( go to hst images ) by j. krist and c. burrows describing how the psfs were constructed .",
    "whenever psf subtractions were required , we used all four psfs determined by krist and burrows . for each case , we selected the result that gave the cleanest subtraction ( i.e. , the fewest artifacts produced )",
    ".    we fit a stellar point - spread function to each quasar image and subtracted a multiple of the normalized psf to search for underlying diffuse light from hosts .",
    "the best fit was determined by minimizing the differences between the quasar and the psf using a @xmath57-routine calculated in two distinct areas : azimuthal averages and narrow regions centered on the diffraction spikes .",
    "the two methods gave essentially same results ( see paper  ii ) , differing in inferred host galaxy magnitude by @xmath58  mag .",
    "the quasar images with the psf subtracted presented in this paper were obtained by minimizing the @xmath57 in azimuthal averages .",

    "the psf subtraction , star from star , is very good , although some faint diffuse residuals are still present . if we scale the intensity of mmj  6490 so that the central brightness corresponds to the apparent magnitude of one of our typical quasars , i. e. , @xmath59 , then the residual `` nebulosity '' left over when the mmj  6504 psf is subtracted is about 21.0  mag .",

    ", the magnitude of the host galaxy was calculated using three different methods , aperture photometry ( see   [ subap ] ) , and one - dimensional and two - dimensional galaxy modeling ( see   [ subrp ] and   [ subtwo ] ) .",
    "we determined the size of the quasar hosts by examining the psf subtracted images and measuring the faintest isophotes of the host galaxy .",
    "the morphological classification was done by visual inspection of the images and following as closely as possible the classification given in _",
    "the hubble atlas of galaxies _ by sandage ( 1961 ) . in a number of cases indicated by ( ? ) in table  [ size ] , we have denoted as `` en '' featureless , smooth hosts that do not show any obvious discontinuities or morphological features .",
    "in this section , we describe the different methods of analysis that we have used to determine the properties of the quasar hosts .",

    "  [ subrp ] the radial profile fits , and in   [ subtwo ] the two - dimensional fits .",
    "some of the host environments are complex , including merging or tidally interacting galaxies and close companions .",
    "the smooth de vaucouleurs or exponential disk models used in   [ subrp ] and [ subtwo ] are obviously not realistic descriptions of the light distribution for complex environments . in order to provide a common basis of comparison with ground based observations ,",
    "we provide the results of fits with smooth models for all of the host environments , complex or not .",
    "we performed aperture photometry in circular annuli centered on the quasars , after a best - fit psf was subtracted .",
    "an inner radius of @xmath60  was used for all quasars , except for he  1029@xmath24140 and 3c  273 . in most observations ,",
    "the region @xmath61  is contaminated by artifacts left by the psf subtraction .",
    "the saturated areas in the images of he  1029@xmath24140 and 3c  273 are larger ; for those two cases , the inner radii used were 1.5  and 2.0 , respectively . the outer radii chosen in general represent how far we could see the host galaxy ( see table  [ result ] ) .",
    "the aperture magnitudes calculated using an inner radius @xmath60  are typically @xmath62  mag fainter than the total magnitude for the galaxy that was estimated by fitting a model ( see    [ subrp][subtwo ] ) to the measured surface brightness .",
    "a difference between aperture and model magnitudes is expected because the aperture magnitudes do not include the area within 1  of the quasar ; all of the models we considered have surface brightnesses that increase monotonically toward the center .",
    "the one - dimensional azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profiles of the host galaxies were constructed from the @xmath1 data after subtraction of a best - fit stellar psf .",
    "regions affected by saturation , diffraction spikes , or residual artifacts from the psf subtraction were not included in the azimuthally averaged profiles .",
    "for each galaxy , we obtained a best - fitting exponential disk ( henceforth disk ) and a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 , henceforth gdv ) profile that fits the observed data in the region @xmath63 .",
    "the total magnitudes obtained this way are systematically brighter than the ones obtained by aperture photometry (   [ subap ] ) which excludes the innermost , saturated regions of the profiles .",
    "the @xmath1 imaging provides greater detail than has been available previously in ground - based images of luminous quasars .",
    "traditionally , the properties of host galaxies have been determined in ground - based studies by making model fits to azimuthally - averaged radial profiles ( see   [ subrp ] ) .    to take advantage of the @xmath1 resolution ,",
    "we have developed software to fit a two - dimensional model to the psf - subtracted quasar images . for each quasar",
    ", we fit an analytic galaxy model ( exponential disk or de vaucouleurs profile ) to the data and calculated the @xmath57 .",
    "the area used for the fit was approximately an annular region , centered on the quasar , that excluded the central area ( @xmath64 ) , and the remnants of the diffraction spikes or other artifacts clearly due to improper psf subtraction .",
    "we fit four parameters : the ( x , y ) pixel position of the center , the total number of counts , and the radius ( effective radius or scale length ) in the galaxy model .",
    "we begin the iteration by giving the software the position of the quasar nucleus , and calculate only the total number of counts .",
    "the number of counts found in this step is entered as the initial guess for the galaxy brightness , and the program then fits the counts and radius , keeping the position fixed . finally , we supply the software with the previously calculated counts and radius and ask the software to fit all four parameters .",
    "we tested the software for the two - dimensional fits in different ways .",
    "initially we created two model galaxies : a disk and an elliptical galaxy .",
    "we checked how well the two - dimensional software reproduced the position of the center of the model galaxies , the scale length or effective radius , and the total number of counts .",
    "we made extensive checks by varying the input parameters and the order in which the parameters were fit .",
    "the best results were achieved when we followed the three step iterative process in the order described above .",
    "we fit each model galaxy with an exponential disk and a de vaucouleurs model - the smallest @xmath65 residuals were obtained when the disk galaxy was fit by an exponential disk model , and the elliptical was fit by a de vaucouleurs model . for the model galaxies ,",
    "the discrepancy in position and size were @xmath66 pixel .",
    "the discrepancy in the total number of counts was @xmath67 .",
    "the accuracy achieved in the simulations is greater than can be achieved with the real data , because of the imperfect subtraction of the psf for the @xmath1 images .",
    "the host galaxies of pg  0052@xmath45251 and phl  909 were also used to test the two - dimensional software .",
    "we compared the software output position with our measured position for the center of the galaxy ( agreement better than 0.2 ) , compared the total number of counts with the value we estimated from aperture photometry ( agreement turned out to be 0.1  mag for pg  0052 + 251 , and 0.5  mag for phl  909 ) , and verified that the output scale length or effective radius were plausible .",

    "if we eliminate from the comparison the most extreme examples of especially complex environments ( 0316@xmath24346 , pg  1012@xmath45008 , and pks  2349@xmath24014 ) the results are ,    @xmath74    the 2-d ( 1-d ) gdv model gives magnitudes for the host that are on average 0.6  mag ( 0.7  mag ) brighter than the exponential disk estimates .",
    "inspection of the @xmath1 images of the quasar fields reveals a number of companion galaxies projected close to the quasars . the relatively long exposures ( 1100 or 1400 seconds ) , combined with the excellent angular resolution , allowed galaxies to be identified down to limiting magnitude @xmath75 and as close as 1  or 2from the central quasar .",

    "figure  [ mvmv ] shows the 2-d model absolute visual magnitudes ( from table  [ summary ] ) of the host galaxies ( and other nebular material ) versus the absolute visual magnitudes of the quasars . for two of the quasars ,",
    "phl  909 and 3c  323.1 , the symbols overlap at @xmath190 and @xmath191 .    in order to be detectable , the host must have a luminosity that is not too small when compared with the luminosity of the quasar .",
    "the minimum detectable host brightness depends strongly upon the assumed morphology of the host galaxy .",
    "we have shown by a series of numerical experiments , described in table  3 of paper  ii , that host galaxies are , on the average , visible on our images down to about 4.2  mag fainter than the quasar luminosity .",
    "galaxies that are smooth ellipticals are the most difficult to detect ( see rows 5d and 5e of table  3 of paper  ii ) . for the eight quasars discussed in paper  ii , smooth elliptical hosts are , on average , visible on our images down to @xmath192 mag fainter than the quasar .",
    "the limiting brightnesses were determined by visually inspecting simulated galaxies placed in the actual hst quasar observations and are therefore somewhat subjective .",
    "the diagonal line in figure  [ mvmv ] represents the detection limit for smooth ellipticals in an idealized sample in which the limiting host magnitude is determined entirely by the quasar luminosity . in calculating the limiting absolute visual magnitudes for the hosts",
    ", we have included an average k - correction ( see fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) for elipticals at @xmath193 , as well as the average magnitude difference , @xmath194 mag , between the quasar and the faintest detectable host .",
    "thus      the form of equation  ( [ linearrelation ] ) reflects the fact that the limiting host luminosity must increase linearly with the luminosity of the quasar , since by assumption the noise introduced by the quasar signal determines how faint a host can be detected .",
    "smooth ellipticals fainter than @xmath196 mag of the diagonal line in figure  [ mvmv ] would not have been expected to be detected if this idealization of the problem is correct .",
    "for the three intrinsically faintest quasars in our sample , the noise introduced by the quasar , the host galaxy , and the background light are all similar . in practice , for our sample one might expect some flattening of the detection limit at the lowest quasar luminosities if photon noise is more important than systematic uncertainties in the subtraction of the quasar light .",
    "mcleod and rieke ( 1995 ) have suggested that there is a linear relation between the quasar absolute magnitude and the minimum host galaxy absolute magnitude .",
    "they interpret this linear relation , shown in their figure  2 , as indicating that a more luminous host galaxy is required to fuel a more luminous quasar .",
    "the linear relation that they find between @xmath197 and @xmath198 is essentially identical to our minimum detection limit for smooth ellipticals that is shown in figure  [ mvmv ] ( for @xmath199 ) . as pointed out by mcleod(1996 ) , the relation described by mcleod and rieke can not be an artifcat produced by detection limits if all of their detections are real detections .",
    "an artifical correlation would be introduced only if true non - detections were interpreted as marginal detections .",
    "there is not convincing evidence in figure  [ mvmv ] for a significant dependence of host luminosity upon the luminosity of the quasar .",
    "the apparent correlation that is suggested to the eye is due in large part to the fact that the single most luminous quasar in our sample , 3c  273 , has the most luminous host .",
    "there is a hint in figure  [ mvmv ] that the average luminosity of elliptical hosts is somewhat higher than for spiral hosts .",
    "most of this difference , however , is due to the fact that , even for the same objects ( cf .",
    "table  [ model ] ) , the de vaucouleurs fitting formula yields estimated luminosities that are @xmath200 mag brighter than the disk fitting function .",
    "the de vaucouleurs formula introduces a luminosity peak in the unmeasured region that is not present in the disk formula .",
    "our results are inconsistent with the hosts having a schechter luminosity function .",
    "the average absolute magnitude for a field galaxy is about 1.8 mag fainter than @xmath201 , ( for an assumed minimum luminosity of @xmath202 ; see , e. g. , efstathiou , ellis , and peterson 1988 for a discussion of the field galaxy luminosity function ) . in our sample ( see table  [ summary ] and figure  [ mvmv ] ) the average host is @xmath203 . moreover , about half by number of the field galaxies would be expected , in a volume limited sample , to lie within a magnitude of the lower limit cutoff of the schechter luminosity function ( which may be fainter than @xmath202 ) .",
    "thus , if the host galaxies were distributed with a schechter luminosity function , we would have expected that about half of the hosts in our sample would be fainter than @xmath204 and therefore undetectable on the hst images .",
    "this is clearly not the case .    by comparing the 2-d model magnitudes of table  [ summary ] and",
    "figure  [ mvmv ] with the results expected from a schechter luminosity function , we conclude that , on average , the host galaxies of the luminous quasars in our sample are about @xmath0 magnitudes more luminous than typical field galaxies .",
    "the conclusions presented in this summary paper are different in emphasis from the conclusions in our first two studies ( see papers  i and  ii ) . in our earlier work , we discussed images of eight quasars ( all are included in the sample in the current work ) , and reported the definitive detection of three host galaxies .",
    "we also presented limits on the brightnesses of the hosts for the other five quasars .",
    "the images presented in this paper show that more than half of the entire sample of 20  quasars has obvious hosts , and there is solid evidence that most , if not all , of the remaining quasars also have host galaxies .",
    "the initial caution that we expressed regarding the detection of host galaxies was due to a combination of the unlucky observing sequence and our conservatism about interpreting the complex @xmath1 images .",
    "the unprocessed @xmath1 data ( see figure  [ figallqso ] ) are sufficient to show , even to the untrained eye , that at least nine of the 20 quasars in our sample have obvious hosts or diffuse environments .",
    "these obvious examples include the three spiral hosts ( pg  0052 + 251 , 1309 + 355 , and pg  1402 + 261 ) , the three quasars `` caught in the act '' ( 0316@xmath24346 , pg  1012 + 008 , and pks  2349@xmath24014 ) , and three prominent ellipticals ( phl  909 , he  1029@xmath24140 , and 3c  273 ) .",
    "none of these quasars were among the first four objects ( pg  0953 + 414 , pg  1116 + 215 , pg  1202 + 281 , and pg  1307 + 085 ) observed ( paper  i ) , and only one ( 3c  273 ,",
    "whose host we described in paper  ii together with the original observations ) belonged to the sample of eight quasars ( paper  ii ) . with a probability of @xmath205 per observation of observing an obvious host , it was simply bad luck ( about a 5% chance ) that only one of the initial eight quasars studied in paper  i and paper  ii had an obvious host",
    ".    given the repaired , but still complex and temporally variable psf of the @xmath1 , we presented our results ( see table  3 of paper  ii ) for the non - detections as a morphology - dependent limit on the brightness of the host galaxy .",
    "spiral galaxies , with their azimuthal variation in brightness and regions of high surface brightness , could be seen to considerably fainter total brightnesses ( more than a magnitude ) than large , extended ellipticals with their smooth , regular profiles . as we have gained experience with the data , we have become more confident of our ability to judge the reality of low surface brightness features .",
    "most importantly , during @xmath1 observation cycle  5 , we obtained additional images of pg  0953 + 414 , a quasar analyzed in paper  i which showed very faint , extended nebulosity that was not centered on the quasar .",
    "the cycle  5 observations were obtained at a different roll angle than those described in paper  i ; the new observations confirmed the reality of the diffuse features ( the nebulosity remained fixed in the sky when the telescope was rotated ) .",
    "the observations of pg  0953 + 414 suggested that some of the faint features were real that we had initially worried could be psf features .",
    "in retrospect , it appears that the vast majority of our initial observations consisted of quasars whose hosts had smooth , regular profiles .",
    "comparing our adopted brightnesses of the hosts ( table  [ summary ] ) with the brightness limits set in our earlier work by simulations ( table  3 in paper  ii ) , we find that the appropriate brightnesses limits ( those for smooth ellipticals like 5d and 5e of figure  5 of paper  ii ) were reasonably accurate .",
    "the detected brightnesses reported in table  [ summary ] of this paper range from considerably fainter than the paper  ii limit ( _ e.g. , _ pg  0953 + 414 ) to slightly brighter than the limit ( _ e.g. , _ 3c  323.1 ) .",
    "since the morphology of the hosts of the initial quasars was biased towards one type of galaxy ( the least favorable type as far as detectability ) , it was not accurate , as we did , to quote a detection limit that was the average of all the galaxy types .",
    "the @xmath1 images frequently reveal companion galaxies that are projected very close to the quasar , in some cases as close as @xmath206 or @xmath207 .",
    "table  [ comps ] shows 20 galaxy companions that are projected closer than @xmath41 kpc to the center - of - light of a quasar and brighter than @xmath208 .",
    "altogether , 13 of the 20 quasars in our sample have close companions that satisfy the requirements for inclusion in table  [ comps ] .",
    "the amplitude for the quasar - galaxy correlation function determined from our data is @xmath209 times larger than the galaxy - galaxy correlation function ( fisher et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "our results for individual objects are compared in section  [ groundsection ] with the results from previous ground - based observations . in general , the agreement with ground - based observations is satisfactory , but not as precise as we would have hoped .",
    "the most straightforward comparison is with the results of vron - cetty & woltjer ( 1990 ) in annular regions well separated from the quasar . even in this case ,",
    "our @xmath1 magnitudes are , on average , 0.4  mag fainter than the vron - cetty & woltjer values .",
    "our 2-d model estimates for the total luminosities are , on average , 0.8 magnitude fainter than their 1-d model fits .",
    "the average discrepancy between our results and dunlop et al .  ( 1993 ) is @xmath210  mag ( our results are generally brighter than dunlop et al . ) , and the average discrepancy between our results and mcleod & rieke is @xmath211  mag .      some pre - hst theoretical analyses ( e. g.,by falle , perry , and dyson 1981 , weymann et al . 1982 , begelman 1985 , and chang , schiano , and wolfe 1987 ) have suggested that luminous quasars may have dramatic effects on their environments via the radiation or hot winds that the quasar emits .",
    "the continuum images shown in this paper do not provide obvious evidence for the effects of the quasar on the host environment .",
    "in fact , the three spiral host galaxies and several of the host ellipticals appear remarkably normal . broad band colors and spectroscopic observations are required in order to determine more sensitively whether the host galaxy is really oblivious to the presence of the luminous quasar in its center .",
    "the theoretical modeling can now be made more specific and compared with the results of the hst observations for individual host galaxies .",
    "these studies will be important in constraining the time scale of the quasar phenomenon and the isotropy of the quasar emissions .",
    "if a quasar shines brightly for only a short period of time or if the emission is highly anisotropic , then the lack of a dramatic effect of the bright agn on the surrounding medium may be more easily understood .",
    "one of the key results that is apparent in figures  [ figallqso ] and [ figallqsosub ] is the detailed evidence for gravitational interactions among the systems `` caught in the act '' ( 0316@xmath24346 , pg  1012 + 008 , and pks  2349@xmath24014 ) .",
