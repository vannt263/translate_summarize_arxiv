    "this paper is concerned with nonlinear wave systems of the form @xmath12 involving a vector - valued field @xmath13 on minkowski spacetime @xmath1 with dalembertian @xmath2 , where the field @xmath13 is vector - valued , and @xmath14 is a smooth function with all derivatives bounded and @xmath5 .",
    "a typical example of such a system is the higher - dimensional sine - gordon equation @xmath15 suppose we are given an initial position @xmath16 and an initial velocity @xmath17 , which are smooth and compactly supported .",
    "standard energy methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) show that for any such data , there is a unique time @xmath18 and a smooth solution @xmath19 to , compactly supported in space for each time @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; furthermore , if @xmath23 , the solution @xmath24 can not be smoothly extended to the time @xmath25 ( in fact the norm @xmath26 must go to infinity as @xmath27 ) .",
    "we say that the equation enjoys",
    "_ global regularity _ if the maximal time of existence @xmath28 is infinite for any choice of smooth , compactly supported initial data @xmath29 .",
    "actually , due to finite speed of propagation ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) ) , the requirement that @xmath30 and @xmath31 be compactly supported can be dropped without affecting the global regularity property .",
    "the equation is an extremely `` subcritical '' semilinear wave equation , since the nonlinearity @xmath32 exhibits no growth whatsoever at infinity . as a consequence ,",
    "there are plenty of _ a priori _ bounds one can place on solutions to with smooth compactly supported initial data .",
    "for instance , suppose @xmath28 were finite . from finite speed of propagation",
    "we see that @xmath33 is supported in a fixed compact region for all times @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , @xmath35 lies in the space @xmath36 , which from and the energy inequality shows that @xmath24 lies in the space @xmath37 . from the chain rule identity @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the derivative of @xmath14 at a point @xmath40 ,",
    "we then conclude that @xmath35 also lies in @xmath41 , and hence that @xmath24 lies in the space @xmath42 . in the case of very low dimensions @xmath43 , sobolev embedding",
    "then gives an @xmath44 bound on @xmath24 which , when combined with energy methods , is sufficient to establish global regularity .    naively one might expect to keep iterating the above procedure to handle arbitrarily large dimensions , but complications arise from the lower order terms in the iterated chain rule ( or faa di bruno formula ) , which can ultimately be `` blamed '' on the phenomenon that @xmath35 may oscillate at significantly higher frequencies than @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , the second derivative of @xmath35 is given by the formula @xmath45 where we do not specify exactly how to contract the various tensors displayed in this equation against each other for sake of exposition .",
    "the existing @xmath46 bound on @xmath24 allows us to place the lower order term @xmath47 in @xmath48 in four and fewer dimensions thanks to sobolev embedding , but this is not immediately obvious in higher dimensions , so one can not immediately upgrade the regularity of @xmath24 to @xmath49 . nevertheless , by increasingly sophisticated arguments @xcite",
    ", @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in more complicated function spaces ( such as besov spaces ) , global regularity for was established in dimensions @xmath7 .",
    "strictly speaking , the hypotheses on @xmath9 and @xmath32 in the above references were somewhat different in these references than those provided here ( in particular , @xmath32 was allowed to exhibit some growth at infinity ) , but the arguments can be adapted to handle the setting under discussion ; for the convenience of the reader we give such an argument in appendix [ reg ] .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that the condition @xmath7 in these previous results is not merely technical , but is in fact nearly the correct threshold :    [ main ] let @xmath8 and @xmath50 be integers .",
    "then there exists a smooth function @xmath14 with all derivatives bounded , and a smooth solution @xmath51 \\times { \\mathbb{r}}^d \\to { \\mathbb{r}}^m$ ] to for some @xmath52 which can not be smoothly continued to the spacetime origin @xmath53 .    applying time reversal symmetry and then shifting this solution in time by @xmath54 , and using finite speed of propagation to smoothly truncate the initial data to be compactly supported",
    ", we see that global regularity for fails in eleven and higher dimensions for general nonlinearities @xmath32 . somewhat frustratingly ,",
    "neither the positive or negative results in this paper seem to extend to cover the intermediate case @xmath11 , which remains open .",
    "the argument in theorem [ main ] uses the strong huygens principle in eleven dimensions , which is unavailable in ten dimensions , but this is most likely only a technical restriction . more seriously , and as we shall see shortly , the numerology of exponents used in theorem [ main ] can not satisfy all the constraints required for a consistent blowup ansatz in dimensions ten and lower .",
    "our methods do not extend to @xmath55 , basically because we can not get any good injectivity properties of @xmath24 in this case , even after using spherical symmetry to perform a dimensional reduction .",
    "in particular , theorem [ main ] does not directly establish finite time blowup for the model equation @xmath56 in eleven and higher dimensions .",
    "however , they provide a _ barrier _ to any attempt to prove global regularity for such an equation , by showing that such an attempt can only be successful if it genuinely uses some additional property of this model equation that is not shared by the more general systems .",
    "we now give an informal and non - rigorous description of the numerology underlying theorem [ main ] , with several of the notions in this description ( such as the interpretation of the @xmath57 symbol ) deliberately left vague .",
    "for sake of this discussion let us restrict attention to the sine - gordon equation @xmath6 in @xmath58 spatial dimensions .",
    "the blowup ansatz we will use is as follows : for each frequency @xmath59 in a sequence @xmath60 of large quantities going to infinity , there will be a spacetime `` cube '' @xmath61 on which the solution @xmath24 oscillates with `` amplitude '' @xmath62 and `` frequency '' @xmath59 , where @xmath63 is an exponent to be chosen later ; this ansatz is of course compatible with the uncertainty principle .",
    "since @xmath64 as @xmath65 , this will create a singularity at the spacetime origin @xmath53 . to make this ansatz plausible , we wish to make the oscillation of @xmath24 on @xmath66 driven primarily by the forcing term @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "thus , by duhamel s formula , we expect a relation roughly of the form @xmath69 on @xmath66 , where @xmath70 is the usual free wave propagator , and @xmath71 is the indicator function of @xmath68 .    on @xmath68 , @xmath24 oscillates with amplitude @xmath72 and frequency @xmath73",
    ", we expect the derivative @xmath74 to be of size about @xmath75 , and so from the principle of stationary phase we expect @xmath76 to oscillate at frequency about @xmath75 .",
    "since the wave propagator @xmath70 preserves frequencies , and @xmath24 is supposed to be of frequency @xmath59 on @xmath66 we are thus led to the requirement @xmath77 next , when restricted to frequencies of order @xmath78 , the propagator @xmath70 `` behaves like '' @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the spherical averaging operator @xmath81 where @xmath82 is surface measure on the unit sphere @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the volume of that sphere ; see e.g. @xcite . in our setting",
    ", @xmath85 is comparable to @xmath86 , and so we have the informal approximation @xmath87 on @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath88 is bounded , @xmath89 is bounded as well .",
    "this gives a ( non - rigorous ) upper bound @xmath90 which when combined with our ansatz that @xmath24 has amplitude about @xmath62 on @xmath66 , gives the constraint @xmath91 which on applying gives the further constraint @xmath92 which can be rearranged as @xmath93 it is now clear that the optimal choice of @xmath94 is @xmath95 and this blowup ansatz is only self - consistent when @xmath96 or equivalently if @xmath8 .    [ t ]   of @xmath24 using polar coordinates @xmath97 ; it evolves like a free wave except for a forcing term in @xmath68 , and is concentrated on @xmath66 , where it has frequency about @xmath59 and amplitude about @xmath62 .",
    "our construction will be in an odd spatial dimension , so that the strong huygens principle is available , restricting the support of @xmath98 to the neighbourhood of a light cone.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to turn this ansatz into an actual blowup example , we will construct @xmath24 as the sum of various functions @xmath98 that solve the wave equation with forcing term in @xmath99 , and which concentrate in @xmath66 with the amplitude and frequency indicated by the above heuristic analysis ; see figure [ fig : freq ] .",
    "the remaining task is to show that @xmath100 can be written in the form @xmath35 for some @xmath32 with all derivatives bounded . for this one",
    "needs some injectivity properties of @xmath24 ( after imposing spherical symmetry to impose a dimensional reduction on the domain of @xmath24 from @xmath101 dimensions to @xmath102 ) .",
    "this requires one to construct some solutions to the free wave equation that have some unusual restrictions on the range ( for instance , we will need a solution taking values in the plane @xmath103 that avoid one quadrant of that plane ) .",
    "such solutions will be constructed in section [ freesec ] .",
    "our nonlinearity @xmath32 is non - hamiltonian ( or non - lagrangian ) in the sense that it is not of the form @xmath104 for some smooth potential function @xmath105 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath32 be hamiltonian would impose an additional constraint @xmath106 on the solution @xmath24 ( which arises from the clairaut identity @xmath107 ) .",
    "we believe though that for sufficiently large @xmath9 , one can adapt the construction here ( in combination with the nash embedding theorem , as in @xcite ) to ensure that the solution @xmath24 obeys this constraint , and to thus obtain a hamiltonian counterexample for theorem [ main ] in eleven and higher dimensions .",
    "we will not pursue this matter here .",
    "the positive results established in appendix [ reg ] rely on strichartz estimates , while the negative results involve solutions for which the strichartz estimates are not sharp ; this is related to the fact that the solution component @xmath98 that we construct in our proof of theorem [ main ] does not occupy all of @xmath68 , but is instead concentrated near a light cone ( see figure [ fig : freq ] ) , thus `` wasting a dimension '' in some sense .",
    "this may potentially explain the gap between the positive and negative results . in any event , closing the gap in the positive direction seems to require estimates that go beyond the strichartz estimates , whereas closing the gap in the negative direction may require constructions of solutions in which the strichartz estimates are closer to being sharp .",
    "it is possible that one could extend the positive results in appendix [ reg ] to slightly higher dimensions , such as @xmath11 or @xmath108 , if one imposes some additional decay on higher derivatives of @xmath32 at infinity , e.g. if one requires that @xmath109 for all @xmath110 , or even requiring that @xmath32 be compactly supported .",
    "this would go a fair way towards eliminating , or at least attenuating , the blowup ansatz used in theorem [ main ] .",
    "however , the fundamental issue remains in this setting that the nonlinearity @xmath35 can still oscillate at a significantly higher frequency than @xmath24 itself ( although now this oscillation will be largely confined to a small neighbourhood of the zero set @xmath111 of @xmath24 ) , and it does not appear likely that the positive results can be extended to arbitrarily high dimension even with such strong hypotheses on the nonlinearity .",
    "the author is supported by nsf grant dms-1266164 and by a simons investigator award .",
    "the author is also indebted to jeffrey rauch for suggesting this question , and michael peake and claude zuily for some corrections and suggestions . the author is particularly indebted to claude zuily for pointing out a numerical error in the original version of appendix [ reg ] .",
    "we use @xmath112 to denote the euclidean norm of a vector @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 is a smooth function , we use @xmath115 to denote the @xmath116 derivative of @xmath32 .",
    "we use @xmath117 , @xmath118 , or @xmath119 to denote the estimate @xmath120 for an absolute constant @xmath121 , and @xmath122 to denote the estimates @xmath123 .",
    "we will often require the implied constant @xmath121 in the above notation to depend on additional parameters , which we will indicate by subscripts ( unless explicitly omitted ) , thus for instance @xmath124 denotes an estimate of the form @xmath125 for some @xmath126 depending on @xmath127 .",
    "we will be working with smooth spherically symmetric functions @xmath128 on various intervals @xmath129 , that is to say functions @xmath130 that depend only on the time @xmath20 and on the magnitude @xmath131 of the spatial variable .",
    "as is well known , one can perform a dimensional reduction , using the coordinates @xmath97 instead of @xmath132 , to view such functions as functions on the strip @xmath133 rather than @xmath134 .",
    "but when one does so , one creates a degeneracy at the time axis @xmath135 ; more precisely , smooth spherically symmetric functions @xmath24 must necessarily have a vanishing gradient @xmath136 at the spatial origin , which makes @xmath137 vanish at @xmath135 .",
    "this vanishing of the first derivative is undesirable for our applications , as we will need to invert the map @xmath24 near the time axis using the inverse function theorem .",
    "because of this , it will be more convenient to work with the variable @xmath138 rather than @xmath139 . in this section",
    "we give some simple calculus lemmas that manage this change of variables .",
    "we begin with the one - dimensional scalar case @xmath140 , in which case spherical symmetry just means that the functions involved are even functions of the spatial variable @xmath113 .",

    "it is possible to reverse the implication and deduce from , but we will not need to do so here .",
    "the factor @xmath150 in naturally arises from the chain rule , since @xmath151 when @xmath152 ; the hypothesis that @xmath32 is even gives an improvement in the range @xmath153 by replacing @xmath150 with @xmath154 .",
    "clearly @xmath146 is smooth away from @xmath155 . by the fundamental theorem of calculus it suffices to prove the uniform bounds for @xmath156 .",
    "we do this by induction on @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath157 case is trivial , so suppose that @xmath158 and the claim has already been proven for @xmath159 .",
    "differentiating the identity @xmath160 , we have @xmath161 for any @xmath113 .",
    "as @xmath32 is even , @xmath162 vanishes at zero , hence @xmath163 by the fundamental theorem of calculus .",
    "we conclude that @xmath164 for @xmath165 ; the claim also follows for @xmath166 by taylor expansion of @xmath32 at the origin .",
    "the function @xmath167 is smooth and even , and by and the triangle inequality , all the derivatives of @xmath168 are bounded .",
    "applying the induction hypothesis with @xmath127 replaced by @xmath159 and @xmath32 replaced by @xmath168 , we obtain the bound @xmath169 which gives the claim when @xmath170 .",
    "it remains to establish in the region @xmath171 for any @xmath172 . from",
    "we have @xmath173 for @xmath174 and some smooth even cutoff function @xmath175 that equals one on @xmath176 \\cup [ 1,2]$ ] and vanishes outside of @xmath177 \\cup [ 1/2,1/4]$ ] . the function @xmath178 is smooth and even , and by and the product rule has all derivatives bounded .",
    "applying the induction hypothesis with @xmath127 replaced by @xmath159 and @xmath32 replaced by @xmath179 , we obtain the bound @xmath180 for @xmath171 , which gives as required .",
    "now we may easily generalise to higher dimensions :    [ cod ] let @xmath181 be an interval , let @xmath182 , and let @xmath128 be a smooth spherically symmetric function obeying the bounds @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and some @xmath185 .",

    "the claim then follows by applying lemma [ rad ] to @xmath24 and its time derivatives .",
    "to prove theorem [ main ] , it is clear that we can restrict to the case @xmath10 , since the general case @xmath50 can then be established by embedding @xmath103 in @xmath194 ( and trivially extending the nonlinearity @xmath32 from @xmath103 to @xmath194 ) .",
    "similarly , we can restrict to the case @xmath108 , as the @xmath195 case then follows by adding dummy spatial variables .    to build the solution @xmath24 in the case @xmath196",

    "we remark in connection with the requirement ( i ) that in dimensions @xmath213 it is easy to make @xmath214 non - negative everywhere due to the positivity of the fundamental solution in this setting .",
    "as is well known , in higher ( odd ) dimensions the fundamental solution contains derivatives , and it turns out not to be possible to ensure that @xmath214 is non - negative everywhere while still being compactly supported in space .",
    "fortunately , for our application to proposition [ vorp ] below , we can `` retreat '' to a neighbourhood of the light cone @xmath215 for the purposes of retaining positivity",
    ". it may be possible to extend this proposition to even dimensions @xmath58 , perhaps by combining the proof techniques below with the method of descent , but we will not pursue this matter here ( since we will ultimately only need the @xmath108 case in any event ) .",
    "writing ( by abuse of notation ) @xmath216 with @xmath217 , we see that @xmath218 needs to be smooth , even in @xmath139 and obey the equation @xmath219 by repeatedly using the `` ladder operator '' identity @xmath220 for any @xmath58 , we see that @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the natural number @xmath223 .",
    "in particular , if we set @xmath224 for some smooth @xmath225 to be chosen later , then @xmath214 will be a smooth function of @xmath20 and @xmath139 that is even in @xmath139 ( there is no singularity at @xmath135 , since the operator @xmath226 preserves the space of smooth even functions ) , and thus also a smooth spherically symmetric function of @xmath20 and @xmath113 ( again , there is no singularity at @xmath166 , as can be seen by applying taylor s theorem with remainder gives an expansion of the form @xmath227 for some smooth coefficients @xmath228 and smooth remainder @xmath229 , which ensures that @xmath202 is @xmath230 times continuously differentiable for any @xmath222 . ] ) ; also , if @xmath231 is compactly supported , then @xmath214 will be compactly supported in space for each time @xmath20 .    from the product rule and a routine induction on @xmath222",
