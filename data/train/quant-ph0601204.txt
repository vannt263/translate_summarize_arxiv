    "a system of atoms interacting with a common reservoir ( the electromagnetic vacuum ) is often treated using an assumption of independent dissipation rates for the atoms .",
    "this is a valid assumption for the case when the interatomic distances are large ( compared to an optical wavelength ) ; however , when the distances between atoms become smaller or comparable to an optical wavelength , the mode structure around one atom is changed due to the presence of other atoms located in its immediate vicinity , and the decay rates are modified .",
    "equivalently ,  the radiation emitted by one atom can be scattered off the second atom , thus changing the radiative properties of the system . as a consequence",
    ", the radiative decay of the ensemble must be viewed as a cooperative effect .",
    "a quantitative analysis of cooperative effects was given by dicke @xcite for an ensemble of two - level systems confined to a spherical volume whose radius is much smaller than an optical wavelength .",
    "for such a system , the collective decay rate can be increased by a factor proportional to the number of atoms in the ensemble .",
    "further investigations extend the treatment to arbitrary interatomic distances , although the calculations become more complex .",
    "formalisms for the treatment of cooperative spontaneous emission and resonance fluorescence from a system of many atoms have been developed @xcite , and have been applied to a system of two two - level atoms @xcite .",
    "cooperative decay in multilevel atomic systems has yet to be treated in detail . a multilevel atom has properties not possessed by a two - level atom : for example , it can store information in superpositions of ground state magnetic sublevels .",
    "such ensembles are extensively discussed in the literature as convenient systems for information storage or large scale entanglement generation @xcite . in particular ,",
    "pencil - shaped media have been used for the generation of spin squeezed and schrodinger cat states , in the context of continuous measurement of a scattered field @xcite . in such schemes , the coupling to the vacuum has a two - fold function : on one hand it gives rise to the signal while , on the other hand , it leads to an irreversible leakage of information from the system to the environment . in treating the losses due to spontaneous emission , the above mentioned assumption of independent atoms",
    "is generally used , which is a sound assumption as long as the atomic density is low . however",
    ", optimal results ( e.g. strong entanglement ) are found in the regime of resonant optical depths greater than unity , a regime in which pencil - shaped media of two - level atoms exhibit superradiant behavior @xcite .",
    "even if the dynamics of a collection of multilevel atoms might be substantially different from that of the two - level ensemble , the validity of the independent spontaneous emission regime is questionable .",
    "we proceed in the present publication with an analysis of cooperative effects in a system of two , four - level atoms .",
    "this provides the starting point for an extension to many atom systems , while it also addresses the non - trivial question of the importance of cooperative decoherence in a simple quantum information system of two qubits .",

    "the decoherence ( of a quantum superposition stored in the ground sublevels ) that necessarily accompanies the process of manipulation of the atomic states has been analyzed in the context of cooperative behavior .",
    "two cases have been treated , where the atoms are either at the same position or separated by a distance comparable to the optical wavelength .",
    "it has been found ( not surprisingly ) that , for the case of close atoms , the `` communication '' between atoms leads to an increase in both the decoherence and population transfer rates . with increasing interatomic separation , in the case of the field propagating perpendicularly to the line joining the atoms ,",
    "the decoherence rate is less than that for close atoms .",
    "this is an expected result since , from the point of view of the classical field the atoms are located at equivalent positions , and a simple decrease of the interatomic coupling due to the increasing separation is expected . for certain distances , however , owing to the oscillating behavior of this coupling , a small effect of decoherence inhibition is also observed .",
    "a more interesting situation arises for the case when the atoms are aligned parallel to the field propagation direction . the equivalency of positions does not hold here anymore , and a spatial phase difference between atoms resulting from the classical field is established .",
    "the coupling through the vacuum is modulated by this spatial phase difference , and a considerable enhancement in the decay rate is observed at separations of order @xmath196 .",
    "these results will be generalized in a future planned publication to a large ensemble of atoms in a pencil - shaped geometry .",
    "in such a medium , at fresnel numbers close to unity , the atoms are practically aligned along the direction of the field ; for large optical depths , the phase effect described above is expected to lead to a substantial increase in the decay of the collective atomic coherence .",

    "in other words , the presence of dissipation can be neglected when writing equations describing the driving effect of the field and later added to the equations phenomenologically .",
    "the derivation of rate equations can now be carried out by writing equations for the ground - excited coherences and excited state populations and coherences and adiabatically eliminating them . however",
