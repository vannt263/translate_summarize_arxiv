    "finding hidden patterns or regularities in data sets is a universal problem which has a long tradition in many disciplines from computer science @xcite to social sciences @xcite .",
    "for example , when the data set can be represented as a graph , i.e.  a set of elements and their pairwise relationships , one often searches for tightly knit sets of nodes , usually called communities or modules .",
    "the identification of such communities is particularly crucial for large network data sets that require new mathematical tools and computer algorithms for their interpretation .",
    "most community detection methods find a partition of the set of nodes where most of the links are concentrated within the communities @xcite . here",
    "the communities are the elements of the partition , and so each node is in one and only one community .",
    "a popular class of algorithms seek to optimise the modularity @xmath0 of the partition of the nodes of a graph @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the simplest definition of modularity for an undirected graph , i.e.  the adjacency matrix @xmath2 is symmetric , is @xcite @xmath3 \\ , \\label{modadef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the degree of node @xmath6 .",
    "the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 run over the @xmath8 nodes of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "the index @xmath9 runs over the communities of the partition @xmath10 .",
    "modularity counts the number of links between all pairs of nodes belonging to the same community , and compares it to the expected number of such links for an equivalent random graph in which the degree of all nodes has been left unchanged . by construction @xmath11 with larger @xmath0",
    "indicating that more links remain within communities then would be expected in the random model . uncovering a node partition which",
    "optimises modularity is therefore likely to produce useful communities .        this node partitioning approach has , however , the drawback that nodes are attributed to only one community , which may be an undesirable constraint for networks made of highly overlapping communities",
    ". this would be the case , for instance , for social networks , where individuals typically belong to different communities , each characterised by a certain type of relation , e.g.  friendship , family , or work . in scientific collaboration networks ( for example @xcite ) , authors may belong to different research groups characterised by different research interests . such inter - community individuals are often of great interest as they broker the flow of information between otherwise disconnected contacts , thereby connecting people with different ideas , interests and perspectives @xcite .",
    "only a few alternative approaches have been proposed in order to uncover overlapping communities of nodes , for example @xcite .",
    "our suggestion is to define communities as a partition of the links rather than of the set of nodes .",
    "a node may then have links belonging to several communities and in this it belongs to several communities .",
    "the central node in a bow tie graph is a simple example , see fig .",
    "[ fbowtiec ] .",
    "this link partition approach should be especially efficient in situations when the nodes of a network are connected by different types of links , i.e.  in situations where the nodes are heterogeneous while the links are very homogeneous . in the case of the social network",
    "mentioned above , this would occur when the friendship network and work network of individuals only have a very small overlap .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sdynmod ]",
    ", we review a definition of modularity which uses the statistical properties of a dynamical process taking place on the nodes of a graph . in section [ slinkpart ] ,",
    "we propose three dynamical processes taking place on the links of the graph and derive their corresponding modularities , now defined for a partition of the links of a network .",
    "to do so , we make connections to the concept of a line graph and with the projection of bipartite networks . in section [ sempanal ] , we optimise the three modularities for some examples and interpret our results . in section [ sdiscussion ]",
    "we conclude and propose ways to improve our method .",
    "to motivate our link partition quality function , let us first consider how to interpret the usual modularity @xmath0 ( [ modadef ] ) in terms of a random walker moving on the nodes @xcite .",
    "suppose that the density of random walkers on node @xmath6 at step @xmath12 is @xmath13 and the dynamics is given by @xmath14 from now on , we will only consider networks that are undirected ( the adjacency matrix is symmetric ) , connected ( there exists a path between all pairs of nodes ) , non - bipartite ( it is not possible to divide the network into two sets of nodes such that there is no link between nodes of the same set ) , and simple ( without self - loops nor multiple links ) . if the first three conditions are respected , it is easy to show @xcite that the stationary solution of the dynamics is generically given by @xmath15 .",
    "let us now consider a node partition @xmath10 of the network and focus on one community @xmath16 .",
    "if the system is at equilibrium , it is straightforward to show that the probability a random walker is in @xmath9 on two successive time steps is @xmath17 while the probability of finding two independent walkers at nodes in @xmath9 are @xmath18 this observation allows us to reinterpret @xmath0 as a summation over the communities of the difference of these two probabilities .",
    "this interpretation suggests natural generalisations of modularity allowing to tune its resolution .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is based on paths of length one but it can readily be generalised to paths of arbitrary length as @xmath19 \\ , , \\label{stability}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",
    "this quantity is called the stability of the partition @xcite . because @xmath21 is an eigenvector of eigenvalue one of @xmath22",
    ", one can show that the symmetric matrix @xmath23 corresponds to a time - dependent graph where the degree of node @xmath6 is always equal to @xmath24 .",
    "therefore @xmath25 can be interpreted as the modularity of @xmath26 , a matrix that connects more and more distant nodes of the original adjacency matrix @xmath27 as time @xmath12 grows @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that optimising ( [ stability ] ) typically leads to partitions made of larger and larger communities for increasing times and that the optimal partition when @xmath28 is made of two communities @xcite .",
    "the above discussion suggests that we should look at a random walker moving on the links of network in order to define the quality of a link partition .",
    "such a walker would therefore be located on the links instead of the nodes at each time @xmath12 and move between adjacent links , i.e. links having one node in common . in the case of the random walk on the nodes ( [ discrete ] ) ,",
    "a walker at node @xmath6 follows one of its links with probability @xmath29 , i.e.  all links are treated equally . however , a link between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 is characterised by two quantities @xmath24 and @xmath21 , so a random walk on the links is more subtle . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on two different types of dynamical process that account differently for the degrees @xmath24 and @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ frandwalks ] ) .",
    "in the first process , a walker jumps with the same probability @xmath30 to one of the links leaving @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath31 , the walker goes with a different probability through @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and we therefore call this process an `` link - link random walk '' ( see fig[frandwalks]a ) .    in the second process , a walker jumps to one of the two nodes too which it is attached , say @xmath6 , then moves to an link attached to that node ( excluding the link it came from ) .",
    "thus it will arrive at an link leaving node @xmath6 with a probability @xmath32 , and similarly it will arrive at a link attached to the other node @xmath7 with probability @xmath33",
    ". we will refer to this as a `` link - node - link random walk '' ( see fig  [ frandwalks]b ) .",
    "this process is well - defined unless the link is a leaf , namely one of its extremities has a degree one , say @xmath6 . in that case",
    ", the walker will jump with a probability @xmath34 to one of the links leaving @xmath7 .",
    "these two types of dynamics are different in general except if the degrees at the extremities @xmath6 and @xmath7 of each link are equal . in the case of a connected graph , this condition is equivalent to demanding that the graph is regular , i.e. the degree of all the nodes is a constant .",
    "when this condition is not respected , the link - link random walk favours the passage of the walker through the extremity having the largest degree .",
    "the difference between the two processes will be maximal when the network is strongly disassortative , namely when links typically relate nodes with very different degrees @xcite .        in order to study these two types of random walk more carefully , it is useful to represent a network @xmath1 by its incidence matrix @xmath35 .",

    "this observation suggests an alternative approach where the dynamics would be driven by the original random walk ( [ rw ] ) but would be projected on the links of the network . to do so ,",

    "in the previous sections , we have proposed three quality functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the partition of the links of a network @xmath1 .",
    "each represents a different dynamical process and therefore explores the structure of the original graph @xmath1 in a different way .",
    "in order to tune the resolution of the optimal partitions , it is straightforward to define the stabilities @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the three processes by generalising the concept of modularity to paths of arbitrary length ( see section ii ) .",
    "the optimal partitions of these quality functions can be found by applying standard modularity optimisation algorithms to the corresponding line graphs . in this paper , we have used two different algorithms @xcite and have verified that both algorithms give consistent results .    as a first check ,",
    "let us look at the bow tie graph of figure [ fbowtiec ] .",

    "a boundary link of a node partition is one which connects two nodes from different communities .",
    "we will then define a boundary node of an link partition to be a node which is connected to links from more than one link community .",

    "such a position is consistent with the link partitions obtained from @xmath96 and @xmath97 , but not with the link partition optimising @xmath95 . in this latter case",

    "[ fkaratecde ] .",
    "this difference originates from the high degree of node 1 which implies that a link - link random walk is biased to pass through this node ( see fig.[frandwalks ] ) , and therefore heavily connects its adjacent links .",

    "the method finds more tree like structures such as the sequence ` lit - on - switch - lever - handle ' which is the backbone of another community linked to bright . on the other hand this flexibility in the structure can produce a confusing picture since many words are members of several communities though mostly having just one or two links per community .",

    "when describing a network , there seems to be a natural tendency to put the emphasis on its nodes whereas a graph is a both a set of nodes and a set of links .",

    ", we have shown that the quality of a link partition can be evaluated by the modularity of its corresponding line graph .",

    "moreover , the equivalence of a link partition of a graph @xmath1 with the node partitioning of the corresponding line graph @xmath47 means that one can use existing node partitioning code with only the expense of producing a line graph transformation and an @xmath117 increase in memory to accommodate the larger line graph .",
    "even the memory cost can be reduced to be @xmath118 since we have shown our link partitioning is equivalent to a process occurring on the links of the original graph @xmath1 , so a line graph need not be produced explicitly .",
    "our method can be seen as a generalisation of the popular k - clique percolation @xcite , which finds sets of connected k - cliques . by way of comparison",
    "we find collections of two - cliques which are more densely connected than expected in an equivalent null model .",
    "thus the link partitioning of our paper can be seen as an extension of two - clique percolation that allows for the uncovering of finer modules , i.e. two - clique percolation trivially uncovers connected components .",
    "an interesting generalisation would be to apply our approach to the case of triangles , 4-cliques , etc .",
    "to do so , one has to replace the incidence matrix ( relating nodes and links ) by a more general bipartite graph , representing the membership of nodes in a clique of interest . our random walk analysis in terms of this bipartite graph",
    "would then proceed in the same fashion , and should allow to uncover finer modules than those obtained by k - clique percolation .",
    "all our expressions also hold for the case of weighted networks .",
    "even multiedges can be accommodated if we start from the incidence matrix , @xmath35 .",
    "however the beauty of our approach is that any type of graph analysis , be it community detection or something else , can be applied to a line graph rather than the original graph . in this way , one can view a network from a completely different angle yet use well established techniques to obtain fresh information about its structure .",
    "r.l .  would like to thank m.  barahona and v.  eguiluz for interesting discussions , and uk epsrc for support .",
    "after this work was finished , we received the paper of ahn et al.@xcite who also look at edge partitions but not in terms of weighted line graphs .",
