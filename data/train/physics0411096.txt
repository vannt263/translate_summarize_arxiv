    "within the last few years , nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) in strong , linearly polarized laser fields has attracted a great deal of attention , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "this interest has been triggered by the outcome of experiments in which the momentum component parallel to the laser field polarization could be resolved , either for the doubly charged ion @xcite , or for both electrons @xcite .",
    "indeed , the observed features , namely two circular regions along the parallel momenta @xmath3 peaked at @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the ponderomotive energy , are a clear fingerprint of electron - electron correlation , and can be explained by a simple , three - step rescattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "thereby , an electron leaves an atom through tunneling ionization ( the first step ) , propagates in the continuum , being accelerated by the field ( the second step ) , and recollides inelastically with its parent ion ( the third step ) . in this collision , it transfers part of its kinetic energy to a second electron , which is then released .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", there exist models , both classical class , slowdown , pulse and quantum - mechanical abeckerrep , abecker , smatrix , lphys , pransdi1,pransdi2,pulseqm , based on such a mechanism , which qualitatively reproduce the above - mentioned features . they leave , however , several open questions .",
    "a very intriguing fact is that , for instance , a very good agreement with the experiments is obtained if the interaction through which the first electron is dislodged is of contact type , and if no coulomb repulsion is taken into account in the final electron states .",
    "this agreement worsens if this interaction is modeled in a more refined way , considering either a more realistic , coulomb - type interaction , or final - state electron - electron repulsion .",
    "specifically , in recent publications , such effects have been investigated in detail using both an s - matrix computation and a classical ensemble model , and have been interpreted in terms of phase - space and dynamical effects pransdi1,pransdi2 .",
    "this analysis has been performed within the strong- field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite , which mainly consists in neglecting the atomic binding potential in the propagation of the electron in the continuum , the laser field when the electron is bound or at the rescattering , and the internal structure of the atom in question .    within this framework ,",
    "the nsdi transition amplitude is written as a five - dimensional integral , with a time - dependent action and comparatively slowly varying prefactors .",
    "such an integral is then solved using saddle - point methods .",
    "apart from being less demanding than evaluating such an integral numerically @xcite , or solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite , these methods provide a clear space - time picture of the physical process in question .",
    "in particular , the results are interpreted in terms of the so - calledquantum orbits .",
    "such orbits can be related to the orbits of classical electrons , and have been extensively used in the context of above - threshold ionization , high - order harmonic generation @xcite and , more recently , nonsequential double ionization @xcite .",
    "the fact that , in @xcite , the crudest approximation yields the best agreement with the experiments , seems to indicate that the presence of the residual ion , which is not taken into account , screens both the long - range interaction which frees the second electron and the final - state repulsion .",
    "this suggests that the presence of the ionic binding potential in the physical steps describing nonsequential double ionization , i.e. , tunneling , propagation and electron - impact ionization , should somehow be incorporated .",
    "indeed , in recent studies , it was found that coulomb focusing considerably influences the nsdi yield @xcite .",
    "another possibility is related to how the initial states in which the electrons are bound affect the electron - momentum distributions .",
    "indeed , the poor agreement between the computations with the coulomb interaction and the experiments may be related to the fact that _ 1s _ states have been used in this case , instead of states with a different shape or spatial symmetry , such as , for instance , _ p _ states .",
    "furthermore , it may as well be that an additional approximation performed in @xcite for the contact interaction , namely to assume that it takes place at the origin of the coordinate system , contributes to the good agreement between theory and experiments in this case . physically",
    ", this means that the spatial extension of the wave function of the second electron is neglected .",
    "such an approximation has not been performed in the computations for the coulomb interaction discussed in @xcite , and , up to the present date , there exist no systematic studies of its influence in the context of nsdi .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate such effects in the simplest possible ways .",
    "first , we assume that both electrons are initially in hydrogenic @xmath1 and in @xmath2 states , instead of in @xmath6 states , as previously done lphys , pransdi1,pransdi2,pulseqm .",
    "one should note that , in contrast to helium , for which @xmath6 states are more appropriate , @xmath7 states yield a more realistic description of the outer - shell electrons in neon and argon , respectively .",
    "since the two latter species are used in most experiments , the choice of @xmath7 states is justified .",
    "this is included in the transition amplitude as a form factor , and does not modify the saddle - point equations . in both @xmath7 and @xmath6 - state cases ,",
    "we consider that the bound - state wave function of the second electron is either localized at the origin or extends over a finite spatial range , for the contact and coulomb interactions .",
    "this provides information on how the initial state of the _ second _ electron influences electron - impact ionization , and hence the nsdi yield .",
    "a further improvement consists in overcoming the bound - state singularity , which is present in the saddle - point framework , and which has not been addressed in @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we use a slightly modified action , with respect to that considered in @xcite , so that the tunneling process and the propagation of both electrons in the continuum is altered .",
    "such corrections depend on the initial wave function of the _ first _ electron .",
    "hence , they shed some light on how this wave function affects the electron - momentum distributions . in particular , we investigate how such corrections influence several features in the momentum distributions , such as their shapes , the cutoff energies or the contributions from different types of orbits to the yield .",
    "finally , we employ a modified form factor for the first electron , upon return , which takes into account the ionic potential . this is a first step towards incorporating the residual ion in our formalism .",
    "as it will be discussed subsequently , this provides a strong hint that the ion is important , in order to achieve a good agreement between theory and experiment .",

    "the transverse momenta have been integrated over.,width=321 ]    the results in this section show that the shapes of the momentum distributions in nsdi are not only influenced by the type of interaction by which the second electron is dislodged but , additionally , depend on the spatial extension of the wave function of the state where it is initially bound .",
    "in fact , radically different shapes are observed if this wave function is either taken to be localized at @xmath29 or exponentially decaying .",
    "this is true both for a contact- and a coulomb - type interaction ( c.f . figs .",

    "on the other hand , if different initial states are taken , for the same type of interaction , there are no significant changes in the shapes of the distributions as long as such states extend over a finite spatial range .",
    "this is explicitly seen by comparing yields obtained using bound states with different principal quantum numbers .",
    "this is related to the fact that the wave functions ( [ 2p])-([1s ] ) were chosen such that the bound - state energy always corresponds to the second ionization potential .",
    "hence , even if their shape changes , the spatial extension of such wave functions is roughly the same .",
    "it is still , however , quite puzzling that the best agreement with the experimental findings occurs for the crudest approximations , both for the interaction and the initial bound - state wave function , i.e. , for a contact - type interaction and a wave function localized at @xmath104 indeed , taking either a more realistic type of electron - electron interaction , spatially extended bound states , or , still , bound states which are , in principle , a more refined description of the outer - shell electrons , only worsens the agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "if the main physical mechanism of nsdi is electron - impact ionization , there exist two main possibilities for explaining this discrepancy . either the second electron is bound in a highly localized state and both electrons collide through an effective short - range interaction , as the present results suggest , or the tunneling ionization , as well as the electron propagation in the continuum ,",
    "must be improved .",
    "the first issue may be addressed by including the influence of the residual ion in the process , whereas the second issue may be dealt with in several ways .",
    "for instance , in the subsequent section , we will consider corrections of a more fundamental nature , which alter the semiclassical action and thus the orbits of the electrons .",
    "up to the present section , we have implicitly assumed that the form factors @xmath105 and @xmath106 are free of singularities and slowly varying in comparison to the time - dependent action .",
    "however , this is not always true . indeed , in the saddle - point framework",
    ", the form factor @xmath107 is singular if the electron is initially in a state described by an exponentially decaying wave function , such as eqs .",

    "( [ saddle1 ] ) , the denominator vanishes .",
    "due to this singularity , this form factor does not vary slowly with respect to the semi - classical action ( [ action ] ) , and thus must be incorporated in the exponent .",
    "therefore , we take the modified action@xmath109   \\label{smod}\\]]in the transition amplitude ( [ presc ] ) .",
    "this causes a change in the first and third saddle - point equations , which will depend on the initial bound state in question . in particular",
    ", we will consider that the first electron is initially in the hydrogenic states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "this is a legitimate assumption , since the binding potential of a neutral atom , from which the first electron tunnels out , is of long - range type . for the states @xmath110 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , @xmath111 reads@xmath112    @xmath113",

    "in this article , we have introduced several technical modifications in an s - matrix theory of laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , within the strong - field approximation , in which this phenomenon is modeled as the inelastic collision of an electron with its parent ion .",
    "such modifications include different initial bound states for the first and second electron , an adequate treatment of the bound - state singularity which exists in our framework , and an effective form factor which incorporates the residual ion .",
    "we performed a systematic analysis of their influence on the differential electron momentum distributions as functions of the parallel - momentum components @xmath167 , @xmath19 of both electrons .    specifically , we consider that the second electron is dislodged by a contact- and coulomb - type interaction , and assume that both electrons are initially in a @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 hydrogenic state . as an additional case ,",
    "we assume that the first electron is initially bound in a @xmath0 state , and that the initial wave function of the second electron is localized at @xmath104 for the first electron , we take into account only the hydrogenic states , since a neutral atom , in contrast to a singly ionized atom , has a long - range binding potential .    concerning the initial bound - state wave function of the second electron ,",
    "our results show that the nsdi momentum distributions are very sensitive to its spatial extension , but not to its shape . indeed , a spatially extended wave function causes a broadening in the electron momentum distributions along the anti - diagonal @xmath168 even if the second electron is dislodged by a contact - type interaction .",
    "circular - shaped distributions , as reported in @xcite and observed in experiments nsdireview , expe1 are only obtained for a contact - type interaction under the additional condition that the bound - state wave function is localized at the origin of the coordinate system , i.e. , at @xmath104 in addition to this broadening , if the second electron is released by a coulomb - type interaction , there is an enhancement in the contributions near the axis @xmath96 or @xmath97    all the distributions investigated in this article , however , change in a less radical fashion if the second electron is taken to be in a a @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 hydrogenic state , as long as they exhibit a spatial extension .",
    "in fact , although specific changes are observed , such as an additional substructure for a coulomb - type interaction , or more localized distributions for a contact - type interaction , the overall shapes of such distributions remains similar .    furthermore , if the form factor @xmath169 which , within our model , contains all the influence of the initial state of the first electron , is incorporated in the time - dependent action , the only noticeable effect is a suppression in the yield , for regions of  small parallel momenta . indeed , the distributions retain their shapes even if the saddle - point equations are modified in this way .",
    "such changes have been introduced in order to correct a singularity which exists for such the prefactor @xmath111 , within the saddle - point framework , if the initial bound state is exponentially decaying .    finally , the inclusion of the ionic potential at the time of rescattering , as the modified form factors @xmath162 , sheds some light on why , in the absence of the ion , a contact - type interaction localized at the origin of the coordinate system yields the best agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "in fact , the ionic interaction leads to form factors which are very large near @xmath170 .",
    "this causes an enhancement in the distributions in this region .",
    "if the ionic potential is of coulomb type , this effect is overshadowed by the fact that @xmath68 , given by eq .",

    "iii and iv , if @xmath171 ( i.e. , for @xmath17 of contact - type and a localized state for the second electron ) , the very same effect is caused by integrating over the phase space .",
    "interestingly , if , in the presence of the ion , we consider @xmath1 states , which are more realistic assumptions for our model , the agreement with the experimental findings improves even more .    in conclusion ,",
    "the present results indicate that the ionic potential is an important ingredient for a realistic modeling of nsdi . indeed , of all the technical modifications considered in this paper , which aimed at making the model more realistic , this was the only which played a major role in improving the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the other modifications either worsened this agreement , or had almost no influence on the momentum distributions .",
    "this supports the hypotheses raised in previous studies @xcite , that the residual ion might be screening both the long - range of the coulomb interaction , or the final - state coulomb repulsion , so that , effectively , the electron - electron interaction is of contact - type , and the bound - state wave functions are localized .",
    "we would like to stress out , however , that the treatment performed in sec .",
    "v is only a first approximation for a rigorous study of the ionic potential .",
    "there exist , in principle , more rigorous methods for incorporating the residual ion",
    ". the first approach would be to consider the ion as a further interaction in our model , and modify the transition amplitude accordingly .",
    "this is , however , a highly non - trivial task , since it would lead to one more rescattering and a further integral in the transition amplitude .",
    "another possibility would be to incorporate the ionic potential in the propagation of both electrons in the continuum .",
    "this would allow a clear assessment of the coulomb focusing , which , again , owes its existence to the presence of the ion .",
    "indeed , this effect may as well be compensating the broadening caused by initial spatially extended wave functions .",

    "<S> we perform a systematic analysis of how nonsequential double ionization in intense , linearly polarized laser fields is influenced by the initial states in which both electrons are bound , and by the residual ionic potential . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the second electron is released by electron - impact ionization of the first electron with its parent ion , using an s - matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> we work within the strong - field approximation , and compute differential electron momentum distributions using saddle - point methods . specifically , we consider electrons in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and localized states , which are released by either a contact or a coulomb - type interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform an adequate treatment of the bound - state singularity which is present in this framework . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the momentum distributions are very sensitive with respect to spatially extended or localized wave functions , but are not considerably influenced by their shape . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the modifications performed in order to overcome the bound - state singularity do not significantly alter the momentum distributions , apart from a minor suppression in the region of small momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the only radical changes occur if one employs effective form factors , which take into account the presence of the residual ion upon rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> if the ionic potential is of contact type , it outweighs the spreading caused by a long - range electron - electron interaction , or by spatially extended bound states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to momentum distributions which exhibit a very good agreement with the existing experiments . </S>"
