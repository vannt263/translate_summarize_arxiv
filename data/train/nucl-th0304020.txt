    "<S> the temperature and density dependence of the meson - nucleon vertex form factors is studied in the framework of thermofield dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> results are obtained for two rather different nucleon - nucleon potentials : the usual bonn potential and the variation with a softer @xmath0 form factor , due to holinde and thomas . in general , the results show only a modest degree of sensitivity to the choice of interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> recently  @xcite the temperature dependence of the meson nucleon form factors has been calculated in thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) using the bonn @xmath1 interaction  @xcite that includes exchanges of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons , with the @xmath0 vertex form factor having a monopole form @xmath4 where @xmath5 gev for the @xmath0 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> it is anticipated that in low energy @xmath1 scattering @xmath6 so that the 4-momentum transfer squared is usually minus the 3-momentum transfer squared . </S>",
    "<S> however it has been argued  @xcite that there are several factors that point to a significantly softer form factor with @xmath7  mev . </S>",
    "<S> it was concluded that the @xmath0 form factor for a free nucleon is close to the measured axial - vector form factor , thus giving @xmath8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that a soft @xmath0 form factor would make it difficult to fit the @xmath1 scattering and , in particular the properties of the deuteron . </S>",
    "<S> however holinde and thomas  @xcite established that a good fit can be obtained for @xmath9  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of the temperature and density dependence of the coupling constants , form factors and the critical temperature , where the coupling constant goes to zero , is needed for this softer @xmath0 form factor . </S>",
    "<S> this would clarify any dependence on the choice of the interaction and give us a better understanding of the equation of state that may be relevant for heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of nuclear matter at finite temperature and density and the phase transition from the hadronic to the quark - gluon phase with subsequent hadronisation can provide valuable information about the nature of confinement in qcd .    in this brief communication we present results for the temperature and density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings , using the obepti @xmath1 interaction  @xcite , and compare them to the results obtained earlier with the bonn potential , obep  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main calculational procedure has been described earlier  @xcite and we concentrate on discussing the results in the present note .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence is calculated within thermofield dynamics , a finite temperature field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the finite temperature modifications of the vertex functions are calculated from the one - meson - exchange feynmann diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons are present only for the potential of holinde and thomas . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that for the @xmath32 and @xmath23-mesons this ratio goes through zero at different temperature depending on the density . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature is called the critical temperature , @xmath33 . for @xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the ratio is opposite  </S>",
    "<S> i.e. it increases instead of going through zero . for @xmath36 mesons </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two potentials is smallest at a density of order @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is normal nuclear matter density .    </S>",
    "<S> the changes with temperature for the two sets of parameters are usually quite similar , though the actual numbers differ . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show the critical temperatures as a function of the density of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of @xmath39 for various mesons using the two potentials is quite different . for the @xmath36 and @xmath40 mesons , @xmath39 changes more rapidly for the softer pion vertex , while for the @xmath41meson @xmath39 is practically constant  in contrast with the obep potential , where it changes rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in @xmath42 show quite a significant dependence on the choice of potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated the @xmath43-dependence of the meson - nucleon form factors with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these calculations presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the pion form factor shows a large change and a stronger dependence on the choice of @xmath44 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> for other mesons the form - factors show very little dependence on a hard or soft pion vertex function .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that at density @xmath45 , the behaviour of the critical temperature for the @xmath17 meson is dramatically changed when the parameters of the obe potential are changed . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath46 is sensitive to parameter changes . for the obepti potential @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> is almost constant , while for the obep potential @xmath47 decreases rapidly . for the @xmath14 meson </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 decreases even more rapidly with increasing density . for other mesons </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 has the same behaviour , increasing with increasing density . for all mesons except the pion , the critical temperature increases when one uses the obepti parametrization </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , at moderate densities the critical temperature for the @xmath14 is also somewhat higher .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we present the form factors at several temperatures at zero density . </S>",
    "<S> the form factors of the @xmath0 and @xmath49 vertices are more sensitive to parameter changes , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not . </S>",
    "<S> this is also seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , where the critical temperature for the @xmath3 and @xmath20 mesons is almost the same for both parameter sets at zero density . at high densities </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 , and @xmath53 fall off more rapidly at high momentum transfer , constituting quenching of the cut off parameters for corresponding meson form factors .    to summarise our results we present a practical parametrization of the temperature and density dependence of the form factors . this may be useful for other applications . at small momentum transfers </S>",
    "<S> we can parametrize them by a monopole form @xmath54 where we still use the mass of the corresponding meson at zero temperature and density . in general the effective mass of a meson , @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> is also temperature dependent , but that has not been considered here . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we see that @xmath56 has an almost linear dependence on density , except for the case of @xmath20-meson . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for this case , at moderate densities there is an almost linear dependence . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we can write the following density dependence of the critical temperature @xmath57 furthermore , using a polynomial form for the ratios @xmath58 we find the values of the parameters given in table  [ paramset ] . </S>",
    "<S> again it is clear that @xmath59 can be restored from @xmath60 as given in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the parametrization of the changes with temperature and density of the boson coupling constants to the nucleon , as well as the cut - off parameters in the form factors , provides a useful way to summarise the variation of these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally it is important to realize that while the couplings of the mesons to nucleons decrease to zero at a critical temperature , it is possible that before we reach that temperature , the system may have already undergone a phase transition , leading to a deconfined quark - gluon state . </S>"
