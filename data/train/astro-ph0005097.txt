    "observations of high redshift quasars are of wide cosmological importance since these objects are thought to be associated with the earliest collapsed structures .",
    "many high - redshift radio - loud quasars have recently been found to show low - energy x - ray cutoffs , and these are believed to be associated with intrinsic x - ray absorbers of column densities several times @xmath3 ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994a ; elvis et al .",
    "1998 ; fiore et al .",
    "the radio - loud quasar gb  1428 + 4217 is currently the most distant x - ray detected object .",
    "it has been studied with the rosat hri and asca ( fabian et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "these observations revealed an extreme isotropic x - ray luminosity of about @xmath4 as well as variability by a factor of 2 on a timescale of about 2.4 days in the rest frame .",
    "the asca observations did not allow tight constraints to be placed on x - ray absorption due to the lack of low - energy response in the 0.10.5 kev band and the limited low - energy calibration .",
    "the rosat hri did not give the needed spectral information .",
    "therefore , we proposed gb  1428 + 4217 for observation during the last rosat observations in december 1998 , employing the excellent low - energy sensitivity of the pspc detector to constrain the intrinsic x - ray absorption in gb  1428 + 4217 as well as search for flux and associated spectral variability .",
    "a value of the hubble constant of @xmath5=@xmath6 and a cosmological deceleration parameter of @xmath7 have been adopted throughout .",
    "the rosat pspc observations of gb  1428 + 4217 were performed in the final observation period which was affected by some anomalies . therefore careful data reduction and cleaning",
    "were required .",
    "the first anomaly was an occasional breakdown of the high voltage which was not recorded by the housekeeping system .",
    "these periods can be identified by unusually low master veto rates ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "moreover , the high voltage showed occasional flickering which caused periods of frequent short accepted time intervals ( @xmath9s ) where the nominal voltage ( and thus gain value ) may not be reached .",
    "finally , a gain hole in the pspc detector began to develop which can currently not be corrected for and came close to the on - axis position after 1998 december 13 ( cf .",
    "the december month page of the rosat 2000 calendar ) .",
    "we therefore selected only time intervals before 1998 december 13 with master veto rates between 35 and 300countss@xmath10 and durations exceeding 100s ( see summary in table [ tab_180308p ] ) .",
    "we have verified that within our time selection the on - axis position is not affected by the presence of the gain hole employing the nominal gain - corrected energy image of the al k@xmath11 line .    .",
    "observation log of 180308p ( selected period ) [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     additionally , we wanted to ensure that residual gain uncertainties do not affect the data quality .",
    "we have checked the onboard al@xmath12 measurements that were taken at spacecraft clock times ( approximate seconds after launch ) @xmath13@xmath14 ( 1998-dec-12 , 00:23  00:29 ut ) and at @xmath15@xmath16 ( 1998-dec-12 , 14:02 ",
    "14:08 ut ) and could not find significant variations of the peak of the pulse height distribution .",
    "moreover , effects due to gain uncertainties dominate at higher pulse height amplitudes and our analysis concentrates on the softer energy range .",
    "nevertheless , we re - processed our events with varying gain values ( @xmath17 channels ) to confirm that this effect is unimportant in our case ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we note that calibration uncertainties in the very softest channels may be present , and some authors find indications that the rosat pspc effective area may actually be larger than expected ( e.g. wolff et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this would cause the column densities measured below to be systematically low , and it would only increase the intrinsic absorption in gb  1428 + 4217 .      the analysis of the cleaned rosat pspc data was performed using the exsas software package ( zimmermann et al .",
    "the centroid position of gb  1428 + 4217 in the rosat pspc image is r.a.(2000 ) = @xmath18 , dec.(2000 ) = @xmath19 .",
    "the internal pspc position error is about 20 arcsec .",
    "the total exposure spent on the source was 9446 seconds .",
    "the source counts were obtained using a circular source cell of radius 2.33 arcmin .",
    "the number of source plus background counts within that cell is 1669 @xmath20 41 .",
    "the background was determined from a source - free circular cell with a radius of 8.1 arcmin centered at r.a.(2000 ) = @xmath21 , dec.(2000 ) = @xmath22 ( a nearby x - ray source at a distance of 4.5 arcmin prevented us from using an annulus around the centroid position of gb  1428 + 4217 ) .",
    "the number of background counts expected in the source cell is 190 @xmath20 14 .",
    "the net source counts are therefore 1479 @xmath20 43 , resulting in a mean count rate of 0.156 @xmath20 0.004 @xmath23 in the 0.12.4 kev energy range .",
    "the timing properties of gb  1428 + 4217 are discussed in section 4 .      in the following",
    "we constrain the spectral properties of gb  1428 + 4217 .",
    "the confidence intervals for the rosat fit parameters presented below correspond to 90 per cent intervals .",
    "first , we have performed a power - law fit ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) with the neutral absorption column density constrained to be consistent with the galactic value of @xmath24  @xmath25 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; elvis et  al .",
    "while this fit is statistically acceptable ( @xmath26=120 for 114 d.o.f . ) , it shows clear systematic residuals at low energies ( upper panel of figure 1 ) , and the derived photon index of 1.04@xmath200.18 is substantially flatter than that measured by asca ( 1.29@xmath200.05 ; fabian et al .",
    "while we can not statistically rule out a flattening of the intrinsic continuum at low energies , such flattenings are not usually seen in active galaxies , and the intrinsic continuum would need to be exceptionally hard .",
    "furthermore , we note that rosat versus asca calibration discrepancies can not easily explain a systematically flatter rosat continuum ( rosat slopes , if anything , appear to be systematically steeper than asca slopes ; see iwasawa , fabian & nandra 1999 ) .",
    "if we require the photon index to lie within the asca range of 1.29@xmath200.05 and the column density to lie within the range consistent with the galactic value , the fit can be statistically rejected with a probability of 98.7 per cent ( @xmath26=150 for 114 d.o.f . ; lower panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "we conclude that plausible power - law models absorbed by the galactic column density can not provide an adequate fit to the rosat data .",
    "a simple power - law fit where the absorption column density and the photon index are allowed to be free parameters provides a better statistical fit to the rosat pspc data ( @xmath26 = 100 for 113 d.o.f .",
    "figure 2 ) . using the @xmath27-test for the addition of one free parameter one",
    "gets @xmath28 = 22.7 ( cf .",
    "11.50 of bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "according to table c.5 of bevington & robinson ( 1992 ) this corresponds to a highly significant improvement ( @xmath29 99.9 per cent ) in the fit quality .",
    "most important , the soft x - ray absorption of @xmath30 is larger than the galactic column towards gb  1428 + 4217 at the 5 sigma level .",
    "the photon index is @xmath31=1.40@xmath200.20 , in agreement with the asca value .",
    "these results are robust to changes in the number of data points included in the fit .",
    "a contour plot of @xmath32 as a function of the absorbing column in the observer s frame and the photon index is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the displayed contour levels of 68.3 , 95.4 , 99.7 , 99.99 and 99.9999 per cent clearly demonstrate the detection of excess absorption above the galactic column towards the high redshift quasar gb  1428 + 4217 .",
    "this excess low - energy cutoff translates into an intrinsic x - ray absorption of @xmath33 for neutral gas and solar abundances . with the current data we are unable to precisely constrain the ionization level of the absorbing gas",
    "; our only constraint is that oxygen must not be completely stripped .",
    "however , we note that increasing the gas ionization level will require even larger column densities than the substantial one already derived for neutral gas .    in the appendix",
    "we have modeled the influence of different gain values on the soft x - ray absorption . with figure a1 in the appendix",
    "we demonstrate that even in the case of unusual gain values the excess absorption above the galactic column is still present .",
    "interestingly , there is another bright x - ray source ( the blazar cso 0454 = 1h",
    "1430 + 423 , @xmath34 ) in the field of view , which can be used to demonstrate that there is not a relevant systematic effect in determining the excess absorption .",
    "the source is outside the gain hole and no other effects prevented the reliable analysis of the data for this source .",
    "a power - law fit combined with absorption by neutral matter ( figure 4 ) results in @xmath35 , in good agreement with the galactic column density . in addition , the x - ray variability found in gb  1428 + 4217 does not occur in cso 0454 ( see section 4 and figure 5 ) .",
    "gb  1428 + 4217 is clearly detected in the rosat all - sky survey with a detection likelihood of 35 ( see cruddace et al .",
    "1988 for the definition of the detection likelihood ) .",
    "the rosat pspc count rate is @xmath36 .",
    "the exposure time is 639 seconds .",
    "the number of source photons detected during the survey observations do not allow precise spectral fitting and the soft x - ray absorption can not be well constrained .",
    "the residuals of the power - law fit to gb  1428 + 4217 ( cf .",
    "figure 2 ) indicate the presence of peculiar ` wiggles ' between about 0.8 and 1.4 kev .",
    "their origin is presently unclear .",
    "the dip at 1.2 kev is near the observed frame energy for the iron k@xmath11 line .",
    "the spectral energy resolution of the pspc detector is not able to resolve any iron emission line shifted into the rosat energy band . these features",
    "may therefore only be due to noise . neither the asca data ( fabian et al . 1998 ) nor the rosat all - sky survey data can rule out the presence of intrinsic residuals at the level seen in the present dataset .",
    "xmm - newton observations of gb  1428 + 4217 may help to solve the origin of these peculiarities .",
    "miralda - escude ( 2000 ) has discussed the possibility that absorption by singly ionized helium ( he  ii ) in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) might be detectable in the soft x - ray spectra of distant quasars . as gb  1428 + 4217 is the most distant x - ray",
    "loud quasar known , we have studied the effect of he  ii absorption in some detail .",
    "the analytic fit to the absorption cross - section presented by verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 were used .",
    "unfortunately the effect of he  ii absorption is completely swamped by that of galactic absorption in the direction of gb  1428 + 4217 which almost completely absorbs all 100  ev x - rays and considerably depletes them at 200  ev . if all the helium in the igm is he  ii down to redshift 3 , then it only causes a further 30 per cent drop in the observed flux at 200  ev which is quite insufficient to explain our observed spectrum ( see figure  2 ) . in order to use soft x - ray absorption to measure intergalactic helium , a bright quasar , preferably a blazar , at @xmath39 in the lockman hole is required .",
    "another , speculative , possibility is that we have detected absorption by intergalactic oxygen . as an example we have replaced he  ii with o  vii in the above model and find a good fit with @xmath40 at the galactic value provided that the oxygen abundance in the igm has almost the solar value down to @xmath41 ( setting @xmath40 to the upper limit of @xmath42 requires that the abundance of oxygen , all in the form of o  vii , must exceed 40 per cent of the solar value ) .",
    "the abundance at least in oxygen must therefore be similar to that of the intracluster medium at low redshifts .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by a search for the resonance absorption lines of oxygen in distant quasars ( see aldcroft et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the most probable explanation is that the downturn is due to absorbing material intrinsic to the host galaxy of the blazar .",
    "this material needs to be metal - rich ( or very high column densities are required ) ; our result of about @xmath3 assumes solar metallicity .",
    "an interesting possibility is that this gas is connected with the youth and possible formation of the host galaxy .",
    "large column densities may be reasonably expected in such young objects ( see e.g. rees 1988 ; fabian 1999 ) .",
    "we note that the optical spectrum ( hook & mcmahon 1998 ) , which covers the rest - frame ultraviolet band of the object , indicates little dust along our line of sight or any large intrinsic absorption by hydrogen ( i.e. any very large damped lyman @xmath11 feature ) .",
    "this means that the absorbing material must be enriched but relatively dust free , and that the hydrogen in it must be ionized .",
    "figure 5 ( upper panel ) displays the rosat pspc light curve obtained for gb  1428 + 4217 between 1998 december 11 and 12",
    ". a constant model fit to the data points can be rejected with @xmath43 per cent confidence .",
    "similarly , if we work out the poisson probability of obtaining the last two data points given the mean of the first six data points , we obtain a probability of @xmath44 .    using the mean of the first six data points and comparing it with the mean of the last two data points results to a variability amplitude of @xmath1 per cent .",
    "no significant spectral variability is detected upon examination of appropriate hardness ratios . using the spectral parameters for gb  1428 + 4217",
    "as displayed in figure 2 the count rate variations translate into a 0.12.4  kev flux change in the observer s frame of @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding change in luminosity in the quasar s rest frame ( 0.613.7  kev ) is @xmath46 ( using the best - fitting spectral parameters and the cosmology given in section 1 ) within @xmath47  s , corresponding to about 6500  s in the rest frame . applying the efficiency limit ( fabian 1979 ; brandt et  al . 1999 ) ,",
    "we derive a remarkable efficiency of @xmath48 .",
    "the efficiency is significantly larger than even that obtained for the narrow - line quasar phl 1092 ( brandt et  al .",
    "such a large derived efficiency strongly supports the evidence for relativistic flux boosting in the source and its blazar nature , previously discussed by fabian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the mean 0.12.4 kev flux obtained from the rosat observations of gb  1428 + 4217 between 1998 december 11 and 12 is @xmath49 , corresponding to an isotropic luminosity in the quasar s rest frame of @xmath50 .",
    "the rosat pspc flux value is somewhat larger than the mean flux values previously reported for gb  1428 + 4217 .",
    "fabian et al . ( 1997 ) give a mean 0.12.4 kev flux of @xmath51 based on a rosat hri observation on 1996 july 30 .",
    "the asca 210 kev flux obtained on 1997 january 17 translates into an 0.12.4 kev flux of @xmath52 ( fabian et al .",
    "in this paper we report on the detection of significant soft x - ray absorption in the most distant x - ray detected object , the highly x - ray luminous quasar gb  1428 + 4217 , obtained during the last rosat observations in december 1998 .",
    "the low - energy sensitivity of the pspc detector was employed to constrain the intrinsic x - ray absorption .",
    "the soft x - ray absorption of @xmath53 is larger than the galactic column of @xmath54 towards gb  1428 + 4217 at the 5 sigma level .",
    "the inferred intrinsic column density is @xmath55 .",
    "the most probable explanation for the soft x - ray absorption is intrinsic absorption in gb  1428 + 4217 .",
    "an interesting possibility is that this gas is connected with the youth and possible formation of the host galaxy .",
    "absorption by intergalactic singly ionized helium ( he  ii ) , ionized oxygen ( o  vii ) or an intrinsic break in the spectrum of gb  1428 + 4217 are found to be unlikely explanations for the soft x - ray absorption .",
    "x - ray flux variability by @xmath56 per cent is detected on a time scale of about 6500 s in the rest frame",
