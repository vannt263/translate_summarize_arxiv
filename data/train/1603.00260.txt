    "information retrieval systems have largely relied on word statistics in text corpora to satisfy information needs of users by retrieving documents with high relevance for a given keyword query . in my phd research",
    "i hypothesize that information needs of users can be satisfied to a greater extent by using _",
    "events _ as a means of navigating text corpora .",
    "events in our context would be an act performed by certain actor(s ) at a specific location during a specific time interval .",
    "an example would be : _",
    "usain bolt won the gold medal at the 2008 summer olympics in bejing_. with the availability of annotators that can provide us with accurate semantic annotations in form of named entities , geographic locations , and temporal expressions ; we can leverage the growing number of knowledge resources such as wikipedia  @xcite and ontologies such as freebase  @xcite to understand natural language text and mine important events .",
    "formally the central hypothesis can be stated as follows :    as a toy example consider the following text snippet   with demonstrative semantic annotations in figure  [ fig : text ] :    in the text snippet ( figure  [ fig : text ] ) , we obtain the named entity whose mention has been identified and disambiguated to point to an external knowledge source . also identified is a geographical location - , which is disambiguated and resolved to its geographical coordinates . likewise the temporal expression has also been resolved to time range . having these semantic annotations we can now devise algorithms that can deduce that the event is that of usain bolt winning olympic competition in beijing , china .",
    "the goal of the proposed research is to leverage the semantic annotations for mining important events and use them to navigate text corpora",
    ". the research will find application in many domains of research such as _ digital humanities _ , in which social scientists are interested in computational history in large digital - born text collections .",
    "anthropologists are interested in cultural and linguistic shifts that occur in such collections .",
    "collectively we can allow _ computational culturomics _",
    "@xcite on corpora to study cultural trends .",
    "events can also be used to link information in multiple and diverse text collections . in short ,",
    "important events provide a way to create a gist from semantically annotated corpora , which otherwise is not possible through manual human effort .",
    "* outline*. the article consists of :    * a literature survey ( section  [ sec : background ] ) ; * an overview of the research problems ( section  [ sec : problem ] ) ; * available corpora , test sources and evaluation measures for research ( section  [ sec : evaluation ] ) ; * discussion of few open technical problems ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "[ sec : background ]    in this section i discuss the progress already made in the area of analyzing different semantic annotations in isolation as well as in conjunction for some of the problems proposed .    * temporal information retrieval and extraction*. researchers have considered only temporal annotations in text corpora to improve retrieval effectiveness by analyzing the time sensitivity of keyword queries and incorporating the time dimension in retrieval models .",
    "some methods of analysis of time - sensitive queries rely on publication dates of documents  @xcite , while others also look at the temporal expressions in document contents  @xcite .",
    "several works also take into account the time dimension for re - ranking documents  @xcite and diversifying them along time  @xcite .",

    "they outline a probabilistic model to solve the problem of extracting relations from text with temporal constraints .",
    "* important events in annotated corpora*. one of the most important seminal works in identifying existing and emerging events were the various tasks in _ topic detection and tracking _ ( tdt )  @xcite . the tdt program aimed to `` search , organize and structure '' broadcast news media from multiple sources .",
    "the five tasks laid within the ambit of tdt where topic tracking , link detection , topic detection , first story detection , and story segmentation . the task of topic tracking required to build a system to detect _ on topic stories _ from an evaluation corpus after being trained on a set _ on topic _ stories .",
    "the link detection task involved answering a boolean query to whether two given _ stories _ are related by a common topic . the topic detection task comprised of declaring new _ topics _ from incoming _ stories _ which had not been presented to the system .",
    "first story detection was another boolean decision task of determining whether the given _ story _ is a seed story ( first - story ) to create a new _ topic _ cluster .",
    "story segmentation task required segmentation of an incoming stream of text into _ stories_.    focusing specifically on extracting and summarizing events in the future , jatowt and yeung  @xcite present a model - based clustering algorithm .",
    "the clustering considers both textual and temporal similarities . for computing temporal similarity ,",
    "the authors model time as a probability distribution by utilizing different family of distributions based on whether its is singular time point , starting date or and ending date .",
    "the similarity is then computed using kl - divergence .",
    "radinsky et al .",
    "@xcite present an algorithm _ pundit _ , which based on the past events in text is able to predict a future event given a query to the system .",
    "the events are represented as multidimensional attributes such as time , geographic location and participating entities .",

    ", which is the result from hierarchical agglomerative clustering .",
    "in order to predict the future _ pundit _ is trained to select the most similar cluster from the _ abstraction tree _ and produce an event representation .",
