    "it is widely acknowledged that further improvements in network capacity are only possible by increasing the node deployment density  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "deploying more macro tiers in already dense networks may be prohibitively expensive and result in significantly reduced cell splitting gains due to severe inter - cell interference  @xcite .",
    "heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) that embed a large number of low - power nodes into an existing macro network with the aim of offloading traffic from the macro cell to small cells has emerged as a viable and cost - effective way to increase network capacity  @xcite .    in a typical hetnet consisting of a macro cell ( mc ) and several small cells ( scs ) , the mc serves its user equipments ( ues ) in a large region by a high - power base station ( bs ) , while each sc serves its ues in its own coverage region by a low - power sc node if there is no cooperative transmission between the bss and scs . due to the large number of potential interfering nodes in the network , properly mitigating both the inter - cell and intra - cell multiuser interference is a crucial issue facing hetnet .",
    "interference control ( ic ) for the interference networks recently has been intensively studied and applied in hetnet  @xcite , and the coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission is demonstrated to be an effective approach in @xcite , including joint processing ( jp ) and coordinated beamforming ( cb ) .",
    "when the backhaul among the coordinated tiers is able to share both user data and channel state information ( csi ) , the comp - jp transmission is shown to provide high spectral efficiency  @xcite .",
    "however , jp also introduces limitations for practical implementation due to its needs for high signaling overhead . on the other hand , with the bss and scs cooperated in the beamformer or precoder level",
    ", cb strategies only require the share of csi in order to mitigate the cross - tier interference between the macro cell and co - channel deployed scs .",
    "reference @xcite has implemented the cross - tier ic with cb based on a prioritized user selection scheme .",
    "later , a joint selection based ic is presented to achieve more balanced performances between the macro cell ues and the sc ues  @xcite . nevertheless , these schemes with closed - form expressions are only available in certain cases , such as a two - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) interference channel .    in practical systems ,",
    "the design of specific interference control schemes is subject to various criteria and constraints .",
    "typically , interference control is formulated as problems that optimize certain system utility functions , which are directly associated with the ue rates or mean square error ( mse ) .",
    "since the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is not so high in the practical wireless systems , especially at the cell edge , imperative performance improvement in the low and intermediate snr region becomes a motivation in the ic scheme design . in @xcite",
    ", new mse - based transceiver schemes are designed through efficient iterative algorithms for the peer to peer mimo interference channel .",
    "in addition , source and relay precoding designs based on the mse criterion in mimo two - way relay systems are investigated in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to their differences in network architecture , they may not be employed directly into the hetnet systems , where there are hierarchical nodes including bs and scs and each of them can transmit to multiple users .    to the best knowledge of the authors ,",
    "there are no mse - based precoding schemes for hetnet in the literature . in this paper",
    ", we develop three new mse - based precoding schemes for mimo downlinks in hetnet systems consisting of a macro tier overlaid with a second tier of scs .",
    "collectively , the proposed precoding schemes form a design toolbox that is expected to cover a wide spectrum of system needs ranging from superior precoding performance for systems with sufficient computing power to non - iterative precoder for systems without the need to exchange csi among cells .",
    "first , the design of transmit precoding matrices and vectors is tackled by jointly minimizing a sum - mse of all users subject to individual transmit power constraints at each cell . based on this formulation ,",
    "two alternating optimization algorithms named relaxed - constraints based alternating optimization ( rao ) and unconstrained alternating optimization with normalization ( uaon ) are presented , where the rao relaxes the non - convex constraints involved to convex ones first and then employs an alternating optimization technique to produce the solution , while the uaon is performed by embedding the constraints into the optimization process via a normalization step .",
    "motivated by the techniques aimed at multi - cell time division duplex ( tdd ) systems  @xcite , next we develop a low complexity precoding scheme for hetnet where the precoder in each cell is designed separately without the need to exchange user data or csi over the backhaul . by employing block diagonalization ( bd ) techniques at the node side  @xcite , we derive a two - level precoder by a non - iterative algorithm where different interference thresholds are utilized to control the relative weights associated with the interferences for performance enhancement .",
    "moreover , robust precoding schemes are presented correspondingly with imperfect csi known at each node .",
    "finally , we present results from numerical experiments for the proposed precoding strategies under different system configurations as well as a comparison study on performance in terms of mse and bit error rate ( ber ) .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model for the mimo downlinks in hetnet systems is described in section  [ sec : sys_model ] . in section  [ sec : sum_prec ] , a new sum - mse based precoding scheme for hetnet is proposed and two implementation algorithms are elaborated . in section  [ sec : sep_prec ] , a separate mse based precoding algorithm is developed for the bs and scs , respectively , and two - level precoders are derived . then , robust precoders are designed based on the estimated channel knowledge in section  [ sec : robust_prec ] .",
