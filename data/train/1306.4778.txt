    "equation ( [ sch2 ] ) is a semilinear elliptic equation which has been extensively studied in the past two decades . in recent years",
    ", the quasilinear case @xmath21 arose a lot of interest to mathematical researchers . from @xcite , we know that the constant @xmath22 is thought to behave like the critical exponent to equation ( [ sch2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath10 ) and @xmath24 , this kind of problems with different types of nonlinearities @xmath25 at sub-``critical growth '' , i.e. at sub-@xmath26 growth , have been widely studied , see @xcite and so on . in @xcite , by using a changing of variable , they transform the equation to a semilinear one , then the existence of solutions was obtained via variational methods under different types of potentials @xmath27 .",
