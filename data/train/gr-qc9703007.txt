    "black hole solutions to the einstein field equations play a substantial role in our understanding of gravitation .",
    "they provide us with an important arena for testing some of our most fundamental ideas about thermodynamics and quantum physics .",
    "an increasingly large body of evidence that black holes do indeed exist in our universe as physical entities @xcite , and are not merely mathematical constructs , motivates the study of such objects even further .",
    "there has been growing interest in recent years concerning more exotic black - hole - type solutions to the einstein field equations , particularly those with non - trivial topology .",
    "although it was postulated by freidmann _",
    "_ @xcite that in a globally hyperbolic , asymptotically flat spacetime topologically non - trivial event - horizon structures can not be observed ( they collapse before light can traverse them ) , it was later shown that such topologies could be passively observed @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , it has been shown numerically that black hole event horizons with toroidal topology can form , at least temporarily @xcite .",
    "more recently aminneborg _ et .",
    "_ have shown that by suitably identifying points in @xmath0-dimensional anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , black hole solutions can result @xcite .",
    "the black holes they constructed were eternal black holes whose event horizons had non - trivial topology of genus higher than one .",
    "the construction of these ads black holes are generalizations of the construction in @xmath1 dimensions of baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite , and the resultant @xmath0-dimensional black holes can be considered higher dimensional analogues of the lower - dimensional case .",
    "it is natural to ask to what extent this type of black hole can arise from known , or at least hypothetically plausible , physical processes .",
    "it was recently shown that pair - production of such black holes of arbitrary genus is possible in the presence of a domain wall of suitable topology .",
    "in addition to this , solutions with non - zero quasi - local mass and charge were obtained @xcite , generalizating the constructions given in ref .",
    "@xcite to spacetimes with non - constant curvature .",
    "we investigate here the possibility of forming this type of black hole from the collapse of a cloud of pressureless , uncharged dust .",
    "traditionally , the study of gravitational collapse into black holes has been limited to spheres of collapsing dust and gas .",
    "we consider a cloud of dust embedded into a region created by identifying points on a surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "this is a generalization of the collapse process considered in @xmath1 dimensions @xcite , in which it was shown that a disk of pressureless dust could collapse into a btz black hole provided the initial density was sufficiently large .",
    "although we find that black holes of non - trivial topology can form from gravitational collapse in a non - asymptotically flat spacetime , we do not find an analogous constraint on the initial density ; rather we find that arbitrarily small initial densities of pressureless dust will collapse to form such black holes .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we consider in section ii the general structure of the exterior and interior metrics . in section iii",
    "we solve for the metric inside the dust cloud , and in section iv we match this solution to the exterior metric .",
    "we consider the case of collapse to a ` massless black hole ' in section v , and summarize our results in section vi .",
    "a further generalization of the black hole metrics discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite was recently obtained in the context of investigating which cosmological c - metrics could provide suitable instantons for black hole pair - production @xcite .",
    "these metrics included terms for a nonzero mass and charge , thereby yielding spacetimes of varying curvature .",
    "we consider here collapse to neutral black holes only , for which the metric outside of the dust reads ds^2=- ( r^2+b- ) dt^2 + + r^2 ( d^2 + c ^2 ( d ) d ^2 ) , [ eq1 ] where @xmath2 is the time coordinate , @xmath3 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coordinates on a 2-surface of constant curvature , @xmath6 being an angular coordinate whose range is from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 refers to the cosmological constant , with positive @xmath9 corresponding to anti de sitter spacetime , and @xmath10 is a constant of integration corresponding to the quasi - local mass @xcite .    solving the einstein field equations for empty space ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath11 is the only solution . without loss of generality we may set the magnitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 to unity ( or zero ) .",
    "there are then three possibilities @xcite : .25 in    @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 , c is forced to be @xmath16 in order to preserve the signature of the metric .",
    "this is suitable for spaces with positive , negative or zero asymptotic curvature .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath17 are two - spheres , and the topology of spacetime is @xmath18 .",
    "the cosmological constant may be positive or negative .",
    "the resultant spacetime is simply schwarzchild ( anti ) de sitter space .    @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 , the signature forces @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath9 in this case is strictly positive .",
    "the metric corresponds to a spacetime that is asymptotically anti de sitter in the @xmath17 section .",
    "the topology is that of a torus @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath25 , then @xmath26 and @xmath9 is again strictly positive . in this case",
    "the topology is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a 2-surface of constant negative curvature and genus @xmath29 .",
    ".3 in    in case @xmath19 , without suitable identifications in the @xmath30 sector , the black hole event horizon would be an infinite sheet .",
    "such ` black plane ' solutions have been recently noted in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , a black hole with a compact event horizon may be obtained by considering only a portion of the sheet , and making this section periodic through the suitable identification of points .",
    "the shape for the section chosen is a polygon formed from geodesics in the @xmath30 sector , in this case straight lines , cut out of the plane .",
    "the sum of the angles in the polygon must be equal to @xmath31 or greater in order to avoid the formation of conical singularities .",
    "in addition , the number of sides must be an integer multiple of four @xcite .",
    "the simplest polygon fulfilling these criteria is a square .",
    "opposite sides of the square are identified , yielding the toroidal toplogy noted above .",
    "turning now to case 3 , which has the exterior metric [ exthyp ] ds^2=-(3r^2 - 1 - 2 m r ) dt^2 + dr^2 r^2 - 1 - 2 m r + r^2(d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) , where the @xmath30 sector is now a space with constant negative curvature , also known as a hyperbolic plane or a pseudosphere .",
    "these spaces have been discussed in detail by balazs and voros @xcite .",
    "geodesics on the pseudosphere are formed from intersections of the psuedosphere with planes through the origin , and are the analogs of great circles on a surface of constant positive curvature ( a sphere ) , which are intersections of the sphere and planes through the origin .",
    "a projection of the psuedosphere onto the @xmath32 plane is known as a the poincar disk . on it , geodesics are segments of circles , orthogonal to the disk boundary at the edges @xcite .",
    "the pseudosphere , its associated poincar disk and the geodesics are shown in figure 1 .",
    "a compact surface on the pseudosphere can be obtained by identifying opposite sides of a suitably chosen polygon centered at the origin . in order to avoid conical singularities",
    ", we must construct a polygon from geodesics which has angles that sum to @xmath33 or more , and a number of sides that is a multiple of four .",
    "since the geodesics on the pseudosphere meet at angles smaller than those for geodesics meeting on a flat plane , an octagon is the simplest solution , yielding a surface of genus 2 .",
    "this construction is shown in figure 2 .",
    "in general , a polygon of @xmath34 sides yields a surface of genus @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "we shall consider in this paper collapse of a cloud of dust to a black hole whose exterior metric is given by ( [ exthyp ] ) , keeping in mind that our procedure easily generalizes to the toroidal case . in order for a black hole to form , two conditions must be satisfied .",
    "first , the exterior metric must be matched successfully to a metric for the interior of the dust cloud .",
    "secondly , the dust cloud must be shown to collapse in a finite amount of proper time .",
    "simple criteria of homogeneity and topology suggest that we match the above spacetime metric ( [ exthyp ] ) to an interior metric of the form ds^2=-dt^2 + a^2(t ) ( + r^2 ( d^2 + c ^2 ( ) d^2 ) ) ) , [ eq2 ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the comoving radial and angular interior coordinates respectively .",
    "@xmath40 is the proper time of the dust cloud and @xmath41 is the scale factor .",
    "@xmath42 refers to the curvature .",
    "again , requiring the above metric to be an exact solution of the einstein equations with the stress energy tensor being that of pressureless dust yields @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so that the form of the interior metric becomes [ inthyp ] ds^2=-dt^2 + a(t)^2 k r^2 - 1dr^2 + r^2 a(t)^2 ( d^2+^2d^2 ) . where we have subsituted @xmath45 .",
    "in the next section , we shall solve einstein s equations inside the dust cloud .",
    "consider a collapsing dust cloud , surrounded by a vacuum , where the metric for the dust is given by ( [ inthyp ] ) .",
    "it remains for us to solve for the scale factor @xmath41 , checking to see under what circumstances ( if any ) @xmath41 vanishes in a finite amount of proper time , @xmath40 .",
    "the stress energy tensor for freely - falling dust is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the four velocity , defined such that @xmath48 .",
    "in comoving coordinates , this means @xmath49 .",
    "if the initial density is given by @xmath50 and the scale factor is initially @xmath51 , the conservation of stress energy , @xmath52 , will require that @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , requiring that the dust satisfy the standard positive energy criteria implies that @xmath54 .",
    "the relevant form of the einstein field equations with a non - zero cosmological constant is given by g _",
    "_ + g_. [ eq3 ] application of this yields two equations : from the temporal component , a^2 = -  3 a^2 + 8 3 g a^3_0 _ 0 a + k , [ eq4 ] and from the three spatial components , 2 a a + a^2 - k + a^2=0 , [ eq5 ] where the overdot is used to denote the time derivative , @xmath55 .",
    "the second equation is directly derivable from the first , leaving a single independent equation .    from our earlier discussion we know that @xmath56 must be strictly greater than zero , implying    + 3 > 8 g _ 0 , [ eq6 ] from ( [ eq4 ] ) , where @xmath57 is the initial inward velocity of the cloud .",
    "this somewhat counterintuitive condition reflects the need to maintain negative curvature within the dust cloud .",
    "an initial density that is too large could reverse the sign of the curvature of the spatial sections of its spacetime .",
    "the more familiar case 1 , where @xmath15 and @xmath58 , has no analogous limits since the form of its metric allows a free choice in the sign of the curvature .",
    "no such choice is admissible for our metric in a manner that preserves the spacetime signature .    when the cosmological constant is absorbed into the definition of the stress - energy tensor of the einstein equations , it becomes t _ =",
    "p g _ + ( + p)u_u _ where = - 8 g p = p + 8 g. in other words , we can consider the cosmological constant as in some manner contributing to the pressure in our space and lowering the density therein .",
    "if @xmath9 is not of sufficient size , or we do not give the cloud enough initial inward velocity , collapse can not occur .",
    "in fact , for collapse from rest , we require that the net effective density from matter and the vaccum energy be negative . if this condition is not satisfied , the metric will change its signature and will no longer properly describe the dust cloud .    assuming the condition ( [ eq6 ] ) is satisfied",
    ", the dust will abide by the equation of motion given by ( [ eq4 ] ) . solving ( [ eq4 ] ) yields",
    "d = dx , [ eq8 ] where @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the relative scale factor , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . the parameter @xmath64 is given by b= 8 g _ 0 ( 1+v_0 ^ 2 ) [ eq8a ] and has the range @xmath65",
    ". we now have a parametric solution for the scale factor , @xmath41 . while it is possible to generate an exact solution to this equation , it is irrelevant for our purposes",
    ". it is sufficient for us to know that @xmath41 exists as some combination of elliptic functions .",
    "since the interior metric is defined , we can move on to finding the collapse time .",
    "if we start from time @xmath66 , we can use ( 11 ) to find the time until complete collapse in the interior coordinates .",
    "the collapse time , @xmath67 , is found by integrating ( [ eq8 ] ) from @xmath68 to @xmath69 : _ c = _ 1 ^ 0 dx [ eq9 ] this integral can be evaluated numerically .",
    "we find that the collapse time is finite for all allowed @xmath64 between @xmath7 and @xmath14 , and for all allowed @xmath70 .",
    "the collapse time for a range of @xmath70 and all allowed values of @xmath64 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "in the exterior coordinates , the stress - energy vanishes and the exterior metric ( [ exthyp ] ) provides the correct description of spacetime . our final condition on the collapse process will be the requirement that the boundary between the two spacetimes be smooth , with no energy shells separating them . in order to make the dust edge a boundary surface with no shell of stress - energy present",
    ", we will require that @xcite = 0 = 0 [ eq13 ] where @xmath71 $ ] denotes the discontinuity in @xmath72 across the edge , @xmath73 is the extrinsic curvature of the dust edge , and the subscripts @xmath74 refer to the coordinates on the dust edge .",
    "the metric on the edge of the dust cloud is ds^2 = - d ^2 + ^2 ( ) ( d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) , [ eq11 ] where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the boundary coordinates . in the interior coordinates , @xmath78 at the boundary . in the exterior",
    "coordinates , the boundary is at @xmath79 .",
    "continuity of the metric immediately implies @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is also possible to choose @xmath82 .",
    "the boundary metric then becomes ds^2 = - d t^2 + ^2(t ) ( d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) .",

    "[ eq14 ] the overdot refers to the @xmath55 . solving for @xmath83 yields t = dt dt = , [ eq15 ] with @xmath84",
    "this condition tells us the initial radius of the dust cloud is @xmath85 .",
    "it also means that collapse to @xmath86 implies collapse to @xmath87 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature tensor is calculated by the equation @xcite k_ij = - n _ = -n_(_j e_i^+^ _ e^_i e^_j ) , [ eq16 ] where @xmath88 is the unit spacelike normal to the edge , @xmath89 are the basis vectors on the edge defined by @xmath90 . and @xmath91 are the coordinates on the edge . in the interior",
    "coordinates these quantities are n _ = ( 0,,0,0 ) [ eq17 ] and e^_t = ( 1,0,0,0),e^ _ = ( 0,0,1/r_0 a(t),0 ) , e^_= ( 0,0,0 , ) . [ eq18 ]",
    "the calculations of the extrinsic curvature tensor yield k_11=k_22=. [ eq19 ] as the only non - vanishing components .    repeating this procedure in the exterior coordinates , we find e^_t = ( t , , 0,0),e^ _ = ( 0,0,1/,0 ) , e^_= ( 0,0,0 , ) [ eq20 ] for the basis vectors on the edge and n _ = ( - , t , 0,0 ) [ eq21 ] for the unit normal . the non - zero components of the extrinsic curvature tensor are k_00=- , [ eq22 ] and k_11=k_22= ( ^2 - 1- ) .",
    "[ eq22a ]    the matching conditions then imply that @xmath92 in ( [ eq22 ] ) vanishes , yielding c=^2 + ^2 - 1- , [ eq23 ] where @xmath93 is simply a constant .",
    "using @xmath94 we find upon matching ( [ eq22a ] ) to ( [ eq19 ] ) and comparison of ( [ eq23 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) that @xmath95 and m= r_0 ^ 3 a ( a^2 + a^2 - k ) = g _ 0 ( r_0 a_0)^3 .",
    "[ eq25 ] hence a dust cloud of arbitrarily small density can collapse ; the boundary conditions produce no additional constraints .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath1-dimensional collapse of dust into a black hole , which can only proceed if the initial density is sufficiently large relative to @xmath96 @xcite .",

[ eq24 ] which defines @xmath97 , and ensures it will always be positive for collapse provided the constraint ( [ eq6 ] ) is satisfied .    as long as our conditions are satisfied",
    ", an event horzon , @xmath98 , will form around the collapsing dust .",
    "this horizon is found by setting r_h^2 - 1 - 2 m r_h=0 , [ eq24a ] which produces one real , positive root at r_h = .",
    "[ eq24b ] provided @xmath99 . if @xmath100 then r_h = ( ^-1 ( ) 3 ) .",
    "[ eq24c ] the comoving time @xmath101 at which collapse occurs is the time , defined by @xmath102 , at which the dust edge and the event horizon are coincident , and may be found by integrating _",
    "h = _ 1^x_h dx [ eq25h ] where @xmath103 since @xmath41 is a decreasing function of @xmath40 and @xmath98 is non - vanishing .",
    "the value of @xmath104 is finite since the integrand in ( [ eq25h ] ) is positive for @xmath105 , and we necessarily have @xmath106 upon comparing ( [ eq9 ] ) with ( [ eq25h ] ) .",
    "however , the coordinate time at which an external observer will witness the formation of the event horizon is infinite , since an outgoing radial light ray emitted from the surface of the cloud at time @xmath2 obeys the equation = r^2 - 1 - [ eq26 ] and arrives at a point @xmath107 at time t_f = t + _",
    "r_0 a(t)^r_f [ eq27 ] which diverges logarithmically as @xmath108 .",
    "hence the collapse is unobservable from outside .",
    "the proper time for a light source at the edge of the cloud is equal to the comoving time , @xmath40 , and so the emission time between wave crests of wavelength @xmath109 is just @xmath110 .",
    "the arrival time between observed wavelengths @xmath111 is just @xmath112 , and so the redshift of light from the dust edge is z - 1 = - 1 = - - 1 = - 1 [ eq28 ] which diverges as @xmath113 since @xmath114 .",
    "hence the collapsing fluid fades from sight , analogous to the usual oppenheimer - snyder collapse of case i.    we close this section by noting that the only curvature singularity in the spacetime is at @xmath115 .",
    "this is easily seen by computing the kretschmann scalar , which in the exterior coordinates is k= 24(3)^2 r^6 + 2m^2 r^6 .",
    "alternatively , in the interior coordinates k= which diverges when @xmath116 .",
    "the solution for the mass of the pseudosphere is consistent with our previous result that collapse requires sufficient curvature , not density as in traditional black hole models .",
    "this begs the question of what will happen if the density and therefore the mass vanish .    the interior metric is unchanged , but the exterior metric is now ds^2 = - ( 3 r^2 - 1 ) dt^2+dr^2 r^2 - 1 + r^2(d ^2 + ^2 d^2 ) [ eq28a ] where the event horizon is @xmath117 .",
    "the solution for the first derivative of the scale factor becomes a^2 = - 3 a^2 + k. [ eq29 ] where now k = 3 a_0 ^ 2 + _ 0 ^ 2 and the parameter @xmath64 is zero . from ( 14 ) then , the ` collapse ' time for such a ` massless ' cloud is finite , given by t_c=",
    "_ 1 ^ 0 = ( 1 ) .",
    "[ eq26a ]    in spite of these suggestive results , we expect that a massless cloud would be indistinguishable from the surrounding space , and indeed we find the interior massless metric is merely a transformation of the exterior coordinates .",
    "the transformation is : r = r ( t ) , ( t ) = ( t ) , = , = . here",
    ", @xmath118 and @xmath119 has been transformed to a cosine function .",
    "the ` collapse ' time has become simply the time at which the identification surfaces used to construct the @xmath0-dimensional ads black hole ( [ eq28a ] ) merge @xcite . the curvature is no longer singular at @xmath115 , and the singularity is of the misner type .",
    "we have demonstrated that a cloud of pressureless dust can undergo gravitational collapse to a black hole whose event horizon has arbitrary topology .",
    "the properties of the collapsing dust are similar to those of the usual ( case 1 ) oppenheimer - snyder collapse , with black holes of arbitarily small mass being formed from arbitarily small initial density distributions .",
    "perhaps the most unusual feature of the collapse scenario investigated here is that , for a given value of the cosmological constant , collapse is not possible once the density is sufficiently large unless the dust cloud is given a large enough initial inward velocity .",
    "this feature is a consequence of the negative curvature of the @xmath120 sector in the spacetimes we consider .",
    "of course the exterior black hole spacetimes to which the dust collapses have non - trivial topology . by enclosing the entire dust cloud and a portion of the vacuum inside a shell of appropriate stress - energy and topology",
    ", it might be possible to match these solutions onto background spacetimes whose topology is @xmath121 , using methods similar to those discussed in refs .",
