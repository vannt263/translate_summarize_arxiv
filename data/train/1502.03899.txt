    "investigation of bvps for mixed type equations becomes one of the main problems of the general theory of partial differential equations due to several applications of it in both in practice and theory .",
    "nevertheless , despite the great attention to this problem by mathematicians , questions of the spectral theory of bvps , in particular , for equations of mixed parabolic - hyperbolic type equations with integral transmitting conditions , remained hitherto unexplored .    in the work @xcite , analog of the generalized tricomi problem with integral gluing conditions for mixed parabolic - hyperbolic equation was studied .",

    "one can find historical information and notation on main scientific results on related field .",
    "omitting huge amount of work , we just note some of them , which are closely related to the present problem .",
    "one of the first investigations of bvps with non - continuous transmitting conditions for parabolic - hyperbolic equations was work @xcite . in @xcite",

    "easy to ensure that if one exclude current from the system , the following parabolic - hyperbolic equation @xmath7 can be deduced together with boundary conditions @xmath8 @xmath9 in this case transmitting condition will have form of @xmath10 where @xmath11 another example of application can be found in the work @xcite .",
