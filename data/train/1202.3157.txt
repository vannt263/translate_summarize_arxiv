    "magnetars are members of the diverse neutron star family : they are isolated neutron stars whose persistent x - ray emission and soft gamma - ray bursts are powered by their extremely strong magnetic fields of @xmath4  g @xcite .",
    "historically two classes of sources have been identified with characteristics that could be explained by the magnetar model : anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "these original classifications were based on several distinct differences between the two populations ( for reviews , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it has now become clear that they share several properties .",
    "therefore , axps and sgrs form one source class with small differences still maintained , most notably the rates and energetics of bursts during active episodes , with the luminosity distributions of axp bursts being lower by orders of magnitude than those of sgr bursts .",
    "the source discussed in this paper was discovered by the _ einstein _",
    "x - ray satellite and named 1e1547.0 - 5408 @xcite ; it was subsequently confirmed in the _ asca _ galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations identified the source as a magnetar candidate based on its varying x - ray flux , spectral characteristics and the tentative association with the supernova remnant g327.24 - 0.13 @xcite , although no x - ray pulsations or soft gamma - ray bursts were detected .",
    "the magnetar nature of the source was confirmed by the discovery of radio pulsations with the parkes radio telescope , which were subsequently associated with 1e1547.0 - 5408 with atca observations ; the radio source was named psrj1550 - 5418 @xcite .",
    "it is one of only three magnetars exhibiting pulsed radio emission , the other ones being xtej1810 - 197 @xcite and psrj1622 - 4950 @xcite .",
    "a surface dipole magnetic field strength of @xmath5  g has been inferred from its spin period of @xmath6  s ( the shortest of all magnetars ) and its period derivative of @xmath7  s  s@xmath8 .",
    "further studies of the radio and persistent x - ray emission showed that the rotation and magnetic axes of this neutron star are nearly aligned @xcite .",
    "given its characteristics and the lack of bursting behavior , the magnetar source was originally classified as an axp @xcite .",
    "however , in 2008 the source started a series of three active episodes that covered over half a year : the first was in october 2008 , the second , most burst active one started in january 2009 , and the last in march 2009 . during the first episode ,",
    "the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) detected several tens of bursts ; as a result the source was reclassified as an sgr and designated .",
    "this reclassification was firmly established by the extreme bursting activity displayed on january 22 , 2009 , when hundreds of bursts were detected in one day by several instruments , i.e. , _ swift _",
    "fermi_/gbm @xcite , _ integral_/spi - acs @xcite and ibis / isgri @xcite , _ suzaku _ wam @xcite , rhessi @xcite , and konus - wind @xcite .",
    "these bursts had durations and luminosities typical of sgr bursts ; in fact some were so bright that they caused ionospheric disturbances observed in very low frequency radio wave data @xcite .",
    "the distance to the source is currently uncertain , varying from @xmath9  kpc , based on the radio dispersion measure @xcite , down to @xmath10  kpc , based on the tentative supernova remnant association @xcite and the detection of expanding dust - scattering x - ray rings @xcite .",
    "the former estimate has large uncertainties arising from the galactic free electron density model of @xcite used for calculating the radio dispersion measure .",
    "therefore , we adopt here a source distance of 5  kpc . throughout this paper",
    "we use the notation @xmath11 , when calculating burst energies and luminosities .",
    "in this paper we present the temporal and time - integrated spectral analysis of 286 bursts detected with gbm in january 2009 for which we have high time - resolution data . given the very large field of view ( the entire un - occulted sky ) of gbm , this is the largest uniform sample of temporal and spectral properties of bursts during the january activation .",
    "this data set enables us to determine their durations , spectral shapes and energetics , and compare them with other magnetar sources during similar high bursting activity periods : sgr1900 + 14 @xcite , sgr1806 - 20 @xcite , axp1e2259 + 586 @xcite , and sgr1627 - 41 @xcite .",
    "we also compare our results with the analysis of bursts detected by _ swift _ during the same time period @xcite , and discuss them in the framework of current theoretical models . here",
    "we focus on the january 2009 bursts , while the analysis of the october 2008 and february - march 2009 bursts are discussed in von kienlin et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) and younes et al .",
    "( in preparation )",
    ". the discovery of enhanced persistent emission in the gbm data during the beginning of activity on january 22 has been presented in @xcite .    in section  [ sec : sample ] we present our data selection of gbm bursts , and in sections  [ sec : temp ] and  [ sec : spec ] we present our temporal and spectral analysis , respectively .",
    "we discuss our results and their interpretation in the context of other bursting magnetar sources in section  [ sec : disc ] , and we summarize in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "gbm comprises 14 detectors with a field of view of 8  sr ( the entire sky un - occulted by the earth ) : twelve nai detectors covering a spectral range from 8  kev to 1  mev , and two bgo detectors covering @xmath12  mev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview of the instrument and its capabilities ) .",
    "we use here only data from the nai detectors because sgr bursts are not detected above 200  kev .",
    "gbm collects three data types : time - tagged event ( tte ) , ctime and cspec @xcite . to perform detailed temporal and spectral analyses over the typical burst durations of @xmath13  s ,",
    "we selected for our sample only events with tte data , which provide a time - tagged photon event list with a temporal resolution as low as 2  @xmath14s in 128 energy channels logarithmically spaced over the energy range of the nai detectors .",
    "the other two data types can not be used for our purposes , because either their accumulation times are much longer ( cspec ) or they have a worse spectral resolution ( ctime ) .",
    "the tte data type covers the time range from 30 seconds prior to 300 seconds after a trigger , and gbm has been designed to not trigger for 600 seconds after a previous trigger .",
    "this leaves at least 270s between consecutive triggers without tte data .",
    "fortuitously , triggered gbm very frequently ( 41 times on january 22 alone ) , providing a good tte data coverage for hundreds of bursts .    to perform a comprehensive and systematic study of the bursts",
    ", we applied our untriggered burst search algorithm to the ctime data type in both continuous ( 0.256s time resolution ) and trigger ( 0.064s time resolution ) modes @xcite .",
    "for each burst we required a count rate above background in the @xmath15  kev energy range of at least @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the first and second brightest detectors , respectively .",
    "note that the gbm trigger criteria differ from the ones applied in our untriggered burst search , resulting in omitting several gbm triggers from our sample .",
    "we then compared each burst candidate light curve and spectral behavior to those of typical sgr bursts , and checked if the location was consistent with the relative rates in the nai detectors at the time of the burst ( for the orientation of the spacecraft at that time ) .",
    "the untriggered burst search resulted in 555 events on january 22 alone and 597 events in total up to january 29 .",
    "this total number , however , includes events for which tte data are not available and thus excluded from this analysis .",
    "moreover , in several occasions multiple events were part of the same burst as defined by the method employed by @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we required that for two events to qualify as two separate bursts , the time between their peaks in the tte data had to be greater than a quarter of the spin period of the sgr ( 0.5  s in the case of ) , and the count rate level had to drop to the background level between the peaks . applying these criteria to our initial list of events",
    ", we collected 286 bursts from january 22 to 29 , which is the sample we used for our detailed temporal and spectral analysis .",
    "there is a caveat , however , associated with our sample completion . for a significant fraction of the time we were not able to detect with gbm : during _ fermi _ passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and when the source was occulted by the earth .",
    "specifically , on january 22 _ fermi _ was in the saa for 3.5 hours and was occulted by the earth for almost 8 hours .",
    "since some of these times overlap , the total time that gbm could not detect bursts from was @xmath18 hours . to obtain a complete picture of the source activity , we searched the data of other satellites that were triggered by the source . the only instrument with a continuous coverage during the entire day of 2009 january 22 was the _ integral_/spi - acs .",
    "the spi - acs , however , has a higher energy threshold ( @xmath1980  kev ) and provides no energy resolution . as a result it detected fewer bursts ( slightly over 200",
    "* ) , of which only 84 were also detected by the _",
    "integral_/ibis / isgri instrument , and for which spectral information ( @xmath20 kev ) was available @xcite .",
    "thus the gbm sample is by far the most complete uniform data set for that entire day s activity from .    for each one of the 286 gbm bursts we used the tte data of those nai detectors that had a source viewing angle ( angle between the source direction and the detector normal ) of less than 60@xmath21 .",
    "we then checked whether each one of these detectors had an unobstructed view of , i.e. , if no parts of the spacecraft or the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ were obstructing the view .",
    "this last check is important because several bursts had such a high peak flux that they caused autonomous repoint requests of _ fermi _ , leading to the re - pointing of the spacecraft to the source .",
    "the final orientation in those cases was 5@xmath21  off from the lat zenith , resulting in the lat obstructing the view for some detectors .    finally , several bursts in our sample were so bright that they saturated the high speed science data bus of gbm .",
    "this effect occurs when the total tte count rate of all detectors exceeds a limit of 375,000 counts s@xmath8 . out of the 286 bursts",
    "only 23 were affected ; an example of a saturated burst is shown in figure  [ fig : saturation ] ( hatched area ) . we did not use the saturated bursts in our temporal analyses ( section  [ sec : temp ] ) , since the durations , emission times and peak times of these bursts are severely affected .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis using the non - saturated parts of these bursts , and used their fluences only in the compilation of the cumulative energy fluence emitted during the active period of ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "none of the 23 saturated bursts were used in any of the other parts of the spectral analysis and discussion sections in this paper .",
    "+    to characterize the temporal properties of all the bursts in our sample , we determined their durations , emission times , duty cycles and rise times .",
    "we calculate these quantities using tte data binned at 2  ms resolution in the @xmath22  kev energy range .",
    "we apply a two - step background subtraction method to the total number of counts during and around the burst time interval ; details on the particular method used here are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the t@xmath23 ( t@xmath24 ) duration is the time during which 90% ( 50% ) of the total burst counts are accumulated @xcite .",
    "another parameter to quantify burst durations is the emission time @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast with t@xmath27 , the emission time does not necessarily span a time interval of consecutive time bins ; it is computed by adding time bins ordered from the highest to the lowest number of counts until 90% or 50% of the burst counts is accumulated .",
    "we then calculated for each burst the duty cycle @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , which is the ratio of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) over t@xmath23 ( t@xmath24 ) ; this quantity gives an indication of how sharply peaked a given burst light curve is @xcite .",
    "the final temporal parameter we determined is the burst rise time t@xmath30 ( the time for a burst to reach its peak count rate ) ; in multiple peaked events , we used the highest count rate bin as the peak .",

    "figure  [ fig : temp ] shows the distributions of t@xmath27 ( first column panels ) , @xmath31 ( second column panels ) and @xmath46 ( third column panels ) , and t@xmath30/t@xmath23 for single - peaked and multiple peaked events ( fourth column panels ) .",
    "we fit the distributions of the durations and emission times with log - normal functions , and the duty cycle distributions with normal functions .",
    "the means and standard deviations of these functions are given in table  [ tab : temp ] , together with their normal mean values .",
    "next we used the t@xmath27 values and their uncertainties to construct their probability density functions ( pdfs ) as described in @xcite . for each individual pdf",
    "we adopted a two - sided normal distribution with the widths given by the measured ( asymmetric ) uncertainties @xcite .",

    "note that the pdfs peak at smaller values than the duration histograms , namely at @xmath47  ms and @xmath48  ms for t@xmath23 and t@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shorter ( and weaker ) events have relatively larger asymmetries in their uncertainties .",

    "the mean t@xmath23 values in the gbm energy band typically range between 0.1 - 0.2s , while @xmath25 ranges are 0.05 - 0.1s , resulting in duty cycles of @xmath49 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but smaller than the _ swift _ bursts ( 305  ms ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the asymmetric t@xmath30/t@xmath23 distributions for single - peaked events indicate that magnetar bursts have shorter rise than decay times , and the bimodal distribution of multiple peaked events shows that for most bursts the first peak is the brightest .",
    "in section  [ sec : disc ] we elaborate further on the correlation of the temporal and spectral properties of , and compare these to similar correlations in other magnetar sources .",

    "this method is used to fit data with a low number of counts and is a modification of the cash statistic so that it asymptotically distributes as @xmath50 .",
    "we fit various spectral models to the tte data of each burst : a power law ( pl ) , a black - body function ( bb ) , optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) , a power law with an exponential cutoff ( comptonized model ) , a combination of a power law and a blackbody function ( pl+bb ) , and two black - body functions ( bb+bb ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows spectra of one of our brightest bursts ( using only the unsaturated parts ) , whose light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : saturation ] . we have used in this spectral analysis counts from four nai detectors following the detector selection criteria given in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "the @xmath51f@xmath52 spectra in figure  [ fig : spectra ] show fits with the six different spectral models mentioned above and their fit residuals .",
    "the fit residual trends shown here are very similar for all bursts in our sample , with the brightest bursts presenting the strongest trends . from figure",
    "[ fig : spectra ] an obvious conclusion would be that ottb , comptonized and bb+bb fits provide a better description of the data than pl , bb or pl+bb .",
    "section  [ sec : sims ] attempts to quantify this statement .",
    "we note that the apparent feature between 30 and 40  kev in the fit residuals is a result of the nai k - edge , which has not been modeled perfectly in the gbm calibration @xcite .",
    "we have performed fits with and without the k - edge energy channels , and found that their inclusion does not change any of the fit parameters significantly , therefore we included these channels in all fits for better statistics .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations with _ rmfit _ ( 3.4rc3 ) to evaluate the effect of statistical fluctuations on identifying the best model to describe sgr burst spectra . for this purpose we selected six bright bursts ( two from and three from sgrj0501@xmath534516 ;",
    "see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compared pairs of various models , generating 30,000 synthetic spectra for each burst and each relevant detector . each synthetic spectrum was based on the sum of the predicted source counts and the measured background counts in each energy channel .",
    "the former counts were computed from the analytical function with the largest c - statistic used to fit the real data ( null hypothesis ) folded with the instrumental response function of the relevant detector ( as a check , we also used as null hypothesis the function giving the lowest c - statistic and we obtained consistent results ) .",
    "the background counts were estimated for each detector from the real data .",
    "next , we applied poisson fluctuations to the summed counts to obtain the final synthetic spectrum .    during the fit process we generated a synthetic background spectrum by adding poisson fluctuations to the real background estimate in each energy channel , and subtracting it from the synthetic spectrum",
    "the resulting spectrum was fit with the two models of each pair .",
    "we checked and confirmed that the input spectral parameters were well recovered in the fits of the synthetic spectra , by comparing them and their statistical errors to the simulated parameter distributions and their uncertainties .",
    "finally , to test whether this recovery was intensity dependent , we also simulated two weak events and arrived at the same conclusions .",
    "we then proceeded to compare the fits between different model pairs . to this end",
    "we computed the c - statistic difference between one input model and each other spectral model for all 30,000 synthetic spectra per burst , and compared the resulting distribution to the difference obtained using the same models with the real burst data .",
    "first we compared pl and bb with all other spectral models , because the former systematically gave the largest fit residual patterns for the majority of the events in our sample . for all simulated events , we found that statistical fluctuations in the signal and background can not explain that ottb or any of the more complex models fit the data better than pl or bb , including the weakest one with a fluence of @xmath54  erg/@xmath55 . using the same procedure , we then compared different models , namely ottb , comptonized , pl+bb and bb+bb .",
    "our simulations showed that the statistical fluctuations in the data could account for the difference in c - statistic values between these models , preventing us from drawing conclusions on the best spectral shape .",
    "we cross - checked and confirmed the results of our simulations using xspec ( v12.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude , therefore , that we can not unambiguously determine whether ottb , comptonized , pl+bb or bb+bb is the best spectral fit model for our burst sample .    the same method has been used to distinguish between spectral models for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected with gbm ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit resulting in identification of the best - fit spectral model .",
    "the discrepancy with the sgr simulation results here could be explained by the fact that even the brightest sgr bursts have a lower total number of source counts mostly distributed over a much narrower energy range ( 10@xmath5650  kev ) .",
    "although our simulation results were inconclusive regarding the preferred spectral model , we attempt here to narrow down the number of models that give a good description of the sgr burst spectra .",
    "we did this down - selection based on the following arguments .",
    "when fitting the spectra of individual bursts , we obtained systematically large fit residual patterns with the pl , bb , and pl+bb functions for a large fraction of the events in our sample ; all other model residuals were randomly distributed . for the pl and bb models we showed in section [ sec : sims ] that they give a worse description of the data than all other models for bursts with fluences above @xmath54  erg/@xmath55 . in addition , the pl and bb models had predominantly the largest c - statistic values for all bursts compared to all other models , resulting in very large c - statistic differences , typically tens to hundreds and for some events even a few thousand .",
    "this difference increased with fluence , indicating that the brightest events are worst fit with a pl or bb .",
    "such a dependence on brightness was not seen when comparing c - statistic differences between all other models .",
    "the combination of all these arguments led us to discard pl and bb models from further analysis for bursts at all fluences .",
    "our pl+bb fits gave a c - statistic value better than ottb for only one third of the bursts in our sample , while pl+bb has two more free parameters than ottb .",
    "moreover , the pl+bb model systematically gave residual patterns not seen in the bb+bb , comptonized and ottb fits .",
    "we , therefore , excluded the former model from further consideration .",
    "it is not possible to exclude any of the three remaining models , namely ottb , comptonized and bb+bb .",
    "we can not choose between ottb and comptonized because the power - law index we retrieve in the comptonized fits is often very close to @xmath2 ( in photon space ) and ottb is basically a special case of comptonized with an index of @xmath2 .",
    "this is illustrated in the rightmost panel of figure  [ fig : ottbcomp ] , which shows the distribution of the comptonized power - law indices for all events , together with a normal fit to the distribution with a mean value of @xmath57 and a width of 0.41 .",
    "finally , bb+bb is very similar to the comptonized function over this relatively small energy range ( e.g. , see the middle right and bottom right panels of figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) . when comparing the c - statistic for individual bursts , the difference between these two models lies almost always between @xmath58 and 25 , with the majority between @xmath59 and 10 , making the choice of the best fit very difficult .",
    "we , therefore , describe below our results of the spectral fits on all 263 events using the ottb , comptonized and bb+bb models .",
    "the first two panels in figure  [ fig : ottbcomp ] show the @xmath3 distributions for the ottb ( left panel ) and the comptonized ( middle panel ) models .",
    "we note that these are very similar with mean @xmath3 values of 39  kev and widths of 13  kev in both cases .",
    "the ottb function has been applied successfully to sgr bursts detected with instruments that have a similar or smaller spectral coverage to gbm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several studies , however , have shown that if the spectral range is extended down to several kev , ottb overestimates the flux at lower energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] indicates a small trend for overestimation below 10  kev , and a similar hint is seen in several other bright bursts in our sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] also shows that a comptonized function with an index of @xmath60 corrects for this possible trend . for the brightest bursts pulse pile - up could affect the burst hardness , which would be reflected in the index value .",
    "we have performed simulations to study this effect , and for the count rates observed in our brightest bursts , the comptonized index becomes flatter by at most @xmath61 , while the @xmath3 value does not change significantly .",
    "given that the gbm calibration @xcite was done for energies starting at @xmath62  kev and then extrapolated to lower energies , at this point we can not determine the significance of a comptonized index deviation of 0.3 from @xmath2 .",
    "we thus compare in section  [ sec : disc ] the spectral parameters derived with both models to other sgr sources .      as an alternative to ottb or comptonized",
    ", several studies have shown that sgr bursts can be fit well with two blackbody functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we have fit 263 of our bursts in our sample ( excluding the 23 saturated events ) with bb+bb .",
    "several of these , however , were faint and their parameters could not be well constrained . therefore ,",
    "in the following we have limited our sample to those bursts for which the temperatures and fluences of both black bodies have values that are at least two times larger than their uncertainties , resulting in a final sample size of 123 bursts .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : correl2bb ] shows the correlation of temperatures for the low and high temperature bb ; the average values ( and widths ) of the log - normal distributions for the cool and hot bb are 4.6 ( 0.7 ) and 14.8 ( 2.1 )  kev , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : correl2bb ] ( middle and right panels ) also shows the correlations between the fluences and emission areas of both bbs .",
    "we estimated the significance of these correlations with a spearman rank order correlation test . in the following we designate a correlation to be significant",
    "if the chance probability , @xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath64 , when the correlation coefficient follows a normal distribution ; a correlation is marginally significant if @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . while the temperature correlation is almost significant at the @xmath64 level , with @xmath67 , the fluences and emission areas are very strongly correlated .",
    "when fitted by a power law , the slopes of the correlations are @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for all three panels , respectively .",
    "we further discuss these correlations in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we discuss here the energetics of the bursts using our spectral fitting results . we describe the correlations between the spectral and temporal parameters , and compare our results to the ones of other sources in the literature .",
    "finally , we expand on the interpretation of our bb+bb model results .      we have determined the energy fluence for all the bursts in our sample in the @xmath0  kev energy range .",
    "the fluence values obtained with our three preferred models ( ottb , comptonized and bb+bb ) are very similar . in the following we present the fluences for the comptonized fits only , because the model has one less parameter than bb+bb , and there are several events with power - law indices deviating from @xmath2 ( corresponding to ottb ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cumfluence ] shows the cumulative energy fluence during the source burst active period as well as the individual burst fluences . to obtain the best estimate of the total fluence released during that period in bursts , we have used data from all 286 bursts , including saturated events ( black squares ) whose values are merely lower limits .",
    "the fluence range spanned in our sample is rather large , @xmath71 to @xmath72  erg/@xmath55 , which is comparable to the range of sgrj0501 + 4516 bursts observed with gbm @xcite and larger than previous studies of other magnetars @xcite .",
    "this fluence range corresponds to an energy range in bursts of @xmath73 to @xmath74  erg , which is comparable to the values found for other sgrs , but orders of magnitude higher than axp1e2259 + 586 @xcite .",

    "the latter two studies , however , have used time - resolved spectral analyses , while we show here a strong fluence correlation between the two bbs for time - integrated spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : areatemp2bb ] displays the emission area as a function of temperature for both bbs .",
    "the temperature of the cool bb does not show any correlation with the fluence or the emission area of that bb . the hot bb does have a marginal anti - correlation between temperature and fluence , with a chance probability of @xmath145 in a spearman rank correlation test , and a very strong anti - correlation between the temperature and the emission area ( figure  [ fig : areatemp2bb ] ) with a chance probability of @xmath146 .",
    "for illustrative purposes we have drawn a solid line in figure  [ fig : areatemp2bb ] indicating @xmath147 , which corresponds to a constant burst luminosity or fluence .",
    "the line seems to represent best the low - temperature part of the hot bb data , while there is a clear steepening at the higher temperatures .",
    "indeed , a power - law fit of the hot bb data gives a slope of @xmath148 , similar to what has been shown for sgrj0501 + 4516 by @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been performed for sgrs1900 + 14 @xcite and 1627 - 41 @xcite using time - resolved spectroscopy ; our results confirm the trends described in these studies .",
    "a detailed time - resolved spectroscopy of bursts is underway .",
    "finally , we note that the smallest emission areas of the hot bb ( few hundredths of km@xmath149 ) are comparable to the emission area of the bb component found during enhanced persistent emission from in the gbm data after the bursting onset on 22 january 2009 @xcite , possibly indicating a common origin of the two phenomena . for the outburst data studied here , the compact hot blackbody component can be as small as @xmath150 km in size , corresponding to a diameter of the order of the thickness of the outer crust , yet the bulk of the @xmath151-values for the hot bb component correspond to a diameter of @xmath152 km  comparable to the total thickness of the solid crust . for energy injection at or just below the surface , if these scales signify the size of the region in the crust that is fractured by the magnetic stresses , as is likely , then injection scales considerably smaller than the crust height have greater difficulty in disrupting it and initiating a flare , particularly if the anchored magnetic flux tube is non - radial at its footpoint . to leading order , the field energy that threads the injection region scales as @xmath153 , while the length of the required fracture and the corresponding energy required to produce it scale as @xmath151 .",
    "hence , crustal disruption by field twists or shear is expected to be less effective for smaller @xmath151 , a contention that appears to be borne out in the data : the majority of bursts possess @xmath151 values for the hot component on the scale of the thickness of the crust",
    ". moreover , flares with a larger @xmath151 for the hot bb component tend to have a larger total energy output , i.e. , luminosity or fluence .      the bb+bb model results point towards a photospheric interpretation , and perhaps one with dynamic evolution , from one magnetospheric locale to another .",
    "the fitted temperatures exceed those found ( @xmath154  kev ) in the classic x - ray band ( @xmath155  kev ) in quiescent magnetar emission ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating a magnetospheric origin for such photospheres , as opposed to generation of emission purely on the neutron star surface .",
    "while it is possible that the site of outburst activation could be near the magnetic poles , the @xmath156 durations of far exceed the neutron star light crossing time .",
    "hence , even the intense magnetic fields of magnetars can not restrict the emission region of powerful outbursts to small volumes .",
    "accordingly , one expects spatial transport of the burst luminosity during each flare , even if tied to closed field lines .",
    "this is essentially the picture that @xcite originally envisaged for sgrs .",
    "polar origins would permit rapid plasma expansion along open field lines to very high altitudes , so that plasma containment is limited .",
    "near the equator , trapping of the gas is optimal , enabling longer durations of emission , so that quasi - equatorial locales for energy injection might be favored .",
    "the trapping times depend intimately upon the complicated interplay of polarization - dependent compton scattering , and associated lepton diffusion and energy exchange within the photon - electron gas .    the core property evinced in figure  [ fig : areatemp2bb ]",
    "is that the burst luminosity @xmath157 of the collection of bursts ( and approximately also for individual bursts ) is similar for the low and high temperature components .",
    "this is a total energy equipartition feature : if the surface area of a putative magnetospheric emission volume scales approximately as @xmath153 , then the energy in each black - body component is approximately equal .",
    "an @xmath153 scaling most likely applies to the hotter blackbody component as it evolves in a coronal structure , with photon and particle propagation away from an injection zone .",
    "it could be pertinent for burst activation locales near the magnetic poles , but also if the injection site is somewhat remote from the surface , for example in the magnetospheric twist scenario of @xcite and @xcite , which was primarily envisaged for the lower luminosity , quiescent magnetar emission .",
    "however , it is possible that other volume scalings are operating , particularly due to the anisotropizing influence of the non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "for example , volumetric constriction of hot plasma near field line footpoints might modify this correlation modestly . determining the effective volume scaling",
    "requires detailed time - dependent modeling of particle and radiative transfer in a magnetospheric environment .",
    "this motivates future theoretical work on magnetar `` fireballs . ''",
    "yet , for the present , a baseline conclusion is that it is clear that the strong correlation between the energies in the two components suggests that they share the same physical origin if bb+bb is indeed the correct model for these bursts .",
    "it is natural to expect that the high temperature component would be more closely connected to a smaller injection region , where energy is dissipated from crustal stress fractures @xcite or some other origin .",
    "proximity of the injection site to the surface is favored in such a scenario , and the resultant fireball of electrons and photons should subsequently expand and cool at higher altitudes in the closed magnetospheric zone , thereby generating the lower temperature component .",
    "the injection temperature is controlled by the total energy dissipated by hot electrons present in the inner magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic thomson optical depth should be high , so that comptonization will drive thermalization , and the fireball evolution and duration will be influenced by the anisotropic , magnetic eddington luminosity .",
    "equilibration between photons and electrons will be non - uniform over the coronal volume , so that there should be a modest temperature gradient throughout ; the emergent continuum will be a superposition of distorted blackbodies .",
    "in particular , the strong polarization dependence of the anisotropic compton process naturally establishes two different physical scales for the optically thick environment @xcite , with the so - called e - mode photosphere being smaller than the o - mode photosphere . perhaps these physically - distinct regions assume somewhat different temperatures on average , though a more quantitative development of this picture is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "whatever the site of the injection , one anticipates that there will be distinctive evolutionary signatures in the dynamic fireball as it either expands to higher altitudes , or contracts when constricted near magnetic footpoints , resulting into a certain temporal evolution for the temperatures .",
    "evolutionary aspects of the spectroscopy of bursts will be explored in a future paper .",
    "we have presented the results of a time - integrated spectral and temporal study of bursts from during an extremely active bursting period , making optimal use of the spectral and temporal capabilities of gbm .",
    "the durations , emission times and duty cycles are typical of sgr bursts , with burst rise times shorter than their decays .",
    "our spectral analysis shows that the spectra of bursts are equally well described by ottb , comptonized and bb+bb .",
    "the @xmath3 distributions of ottb and comptonized have mean values of @xmath158  kev , while the comptonized power - law index average is close to @xmath2 , i.e. , we recover the ottb index in our comptonized fits .",
    "whether this power law extends down to lower energies can only be determined by combined fits with other instruments , for instance _",
    "swift_/xrt ( lin et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we have investigated the presence of correlations between the various spectral and temporal parameters , and find significant correlations between the emission time and the fluence , and between the duty cycle and the fluence , and a marginal correlation between the duration and the fluence .",
    "we have also shown that there is a significant anti - correlation between @xmath3 and fluence , and between @xmath3 and average flux .",
    "we find an anti - correlation at low flux levels but a weak correlation with @xmath3 at high fluxes , with a possible minimum at 4  erg / s/@xmath55 . in a time - resolved analysis of the bursts from sgr0501 + 4516 , the positive correlation behavior at high fluxes is more significant .",
    "whether the two sources have a similar behavior remains to be seen in the time - resolved analysis of the bursts .",
    "one of the main contributions of the gbm data is providing accurate measurements of the evolution of @xmath3 for short bursts , which is the best hardness indicator for hardness - brightness correlation studies .",
    "for the bb+bb fits we find average temperatures of @xmath159 and @xmath62 kev and we show that these temperatures are well correlated .",
    "the fluences of the two bb functions are strongly correlated , and the same is true for their emission areas .",
    "the emission area of the low - temperature bb is comparable to the neutron star surface area ; the hot bb area is much smaller and strongly anti - correlated with its temperature .",

    "<S> we have performed detailed temporal and time - integrated spectral analysis of 286 bursts from detected with the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) in january 2009 , resulting in the largest uniform sample of temporal and spectral properties of bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the combination of broadband and high time - resolution data provided with gbm to perform statistical studies for the source properties . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the durations , emission times , duty cycles and rise times for all bursts , and find that they are typical of sgr bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we explore various models in our spectral analysis , and conclude that the spectra of bursts in the @xmath0  kev band are equally well described by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) , a power law with an exponential cutoff ( comptonized model ) , and two black - body functions ( bb+bb ) . in </S>",
    "<S> the spectral fits with the comptonized model we find a mean power - law index of @xmath1 , close to the ottb index of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is an anti - correlation between the comptonized @xmath3 and the burst fluence and average flux . for the bb+bb </S>",
    "<S> fits we find that the fluences and emission areas of the two blackbody functions are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature bb has an emission area comparable to the neutron star surface area , independent of the temperature , while the high - temperature blackbody has a much smaller area and shows an anti - correlation between emission area and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the properties of these bursts with bursts observed from other sgr sources during extreme activations , and discuss the implications of our results in the context of magnetar burst models . </S>"
