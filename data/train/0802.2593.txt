    "internal quark structure of exotic hadrons is an interesting topic .",
    "information on the structure would be obtained from parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which are determined by using experimental data in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "stable targets are needed for dis experiments , whereas exotic hadrons decay immediately and their pdfs could not be measured .    in @xmath2 annihilation experiments , fragmentation functions ( ffs )",
    "have been measured for produced several hadrons .",
    "these functions have information on hadronization , so that it is suitable for discussing the internal structure of the hadrons .",
    "the ffs have two types : favored and disfavored functions .",
    "the favored function means a fragmentation from a parton which exists as a constituent quark in the hadron , and the disfavored one means a hadronization from a sea quark . in general , these functions have characteristic features on their peak positions at small @xmath3 ( @xmath41 gev@xmath5 ) .",
    "the favored ones correspond to the valence quark distributions in the pdfs , so that the peak positions of the favored ones exist at large @xmath6 , but those of the disfavored ones do at small @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , such a behavior can be seen in the ffs of the charged @xmath7 meson ( see fig . 11 in ref .  ) .",
    "investigating the fragmentation functions , we can find the flavor constituent in the exotic hadrons .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is considered as a candidate for an exotic hadron , which has structure beyond naive @xmath8 configurations .",
    "therefore , we determine the ffs for the @xmath0 by a global analysis and discuss its possible internal structure .",
    "the ffs are associated with the non - perturbative part separated by the factorization theorem , so that these functions should be determined by using experimental data .",
    "the differential cross section , which is normalized by the total cross section @xmath9 , is given for the @xmath10 process as : @xmath11 here , the variable @xmath6 is defined as the energy ratio of the produced hadron and a parent parton , and it is given by the hadron energy @xmath12 and the center - of - mass energy @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 . in the theoretical calculation with the perturbative qcd , this cross section can be expressed by the sum of convolution integrals with the coefficient functions @xmath16 and the fragmentation functions @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 denotes the convolution integral , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the running coupling constant , and @xmath21 indicates quark flavor or gluon , @xmath22 .    in this analysis , @xmath3 dependence of the ffs",
    "should be taken into account because the experimental data exist at several @xmath3 points .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence is calculated by the dglap evolution equations . to solve the equations numerically",
    ", initial functions must be defined at initial @xmath3 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "a functional form is somewhat arbitrary , which is a cause of model dependence in the global analysis .",
    "we adopt a general functional form which is used in other parametrization groups : @xmath24 where parameter @xmath25 can be rewritten by the second moment @xmath26 ) and the beta function of the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the second moments have a physical meaning of energy conservation , @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are free parameters , which are optimized by a @xmath32 analysis .    as the initial functions of @xmath0",
    ", we assume the relation , @xmath33 .",
    "then , the following five functions @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , are expressed by a number of parameters . here",
    ", the functions for up - quark , strange - quark , and gluon are defined at @xmath40=1 gev@xmath5 , and heavy flavor functions are inserted into the calculation at the mass thresholds , @xmath41=1.43 gev and @xmath42=4.3 gev .",
    "we note that differences between the functions of the up- and strange - quarks would come from its mass difference . in principle , a threshold should be also provided for the strange quark at its mass threshold , @xmath43 gev .",
    "since perturbative qcd would not be applicable at this low scale , which is of the order of @xmath44 , the initial scale is defined at @xmath40=1 gev@xmath5 as the lower limit in the theory .",
    "for this reason , the function of the strange - quark should differ intrinsically from that of the up - quark at the initial scale .",
    "however , flavor separation can not be made only by the @xmath2 experimental data .",
    "we need data from other processes , e.g. , semi - inclusive dis .",
    "cccc type & configuration & second moments & peak positions + strange @xmath8 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + tetraquark ( or @xmath48 ) & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 +    to discuss the internal structure for @xmath0 , four configurations are considered , non - strangeness @xmath52 , naive @xmath53 , tetraquark , and glueball.@xcite for simplicity , two configurations are listed in table .",
    "this configuration can be determined by the relations in the peak positions and the second moments of the ffs . in the tetraquark configuration , for example",
    ", the functions of the up- and strange - quarks become the favored functions .",
    "these peak positions are the same : @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , the relations of the second moments are suggested by order counting of the coupling in schematic diagrams .",
    "hadronizations from the up- and strange - quarks can be expressed by the same diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetraquark ] .",
    "their contributions to the cross sections are reflected in the second moments , therefore these moments will roughly become the same : @xmath54 . by the same estimation ,",
    "relations for other configurations are obtained ( see table . 1 in ref .  ) .",
    "the fragmentation functions are determined by the global analysis with the @xmath0 production data in the @xmath2 annihilation experiments.@xcite total @xmath32/dof is 0.907 , which is a reasonable value in the @xmath32 analysis .",
    "obtained ffs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0-ffs ] .",
    "we find that the peak positions of the functions for the up- and strange - quarks exist at large @xmath6 .",
    "these are the favored functions , and these peaks are located at the same points , @xmath51 .",
    "it indicates the tetraquark configuration as the internal structure of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , values of the obtained second moments are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the second moment of the up - quark is less than that of the strange - quark , which indicates the naive @xmath53 configuration .",
    "this conflicting result is due to low accuracy of the current experimental data .",
    "in fact , uncertainties of the second moments are large . at this stage ,",
    "the internal configuration can not be determined clearly . to discuss the quark configuration in details ,",
    "these uncertainties must be reduced by including precise data in the analysis .",
    "therefore , we hope to get high accuracy data , which could be provided from the belle and barbar experiments .",
