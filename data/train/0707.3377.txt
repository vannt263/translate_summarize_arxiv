    "over the last decade , our theories of the early universe have been promoted from speculation to a field of intense scientific study .",
    "the most important developments in our knowledge concern the nature of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 , , which is proportional to the laplacian of the ricci curvature of comoving spatial slices . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ uniform density curvature perturbation _",
    "@xmath0 is proportional to the laplacian of the ricci curvature on spatial slices of uniform density .",
    "on superhorizon scales , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are equivalent up to a convention for signs @xcite . ] which is believed to have seeded temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "it is now understood that @xmath0 must have had a spectrum which was close to scale invariance on the scales probed by the cmb @xcite .",
    "many proposals have been made to explain how a primordial perturbation with an almost scale - invariant spectrum could have been generated in the early universe .",
    "the most widely - studied candidate is an era of inflation that may have taken place at high energy @xcite , where `` inflation '' is defined to be any epoch in which the scale factor @xmath2 undergoes acceleration , @xmath3 . under this condition ,",
    "local regions of the universe are exponentially driven to spatial flatness , homogeneity and isotropy @xcite , and each light bosonic field acquires a perturbation generated by amplification of quantum - mechanical vacuum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this perturbation is close to scale - invariance when the universe inflates at a rate @xmath4 which is almost constant .",
    "the curvature perturbation observed in the cmb is supposed to be a model - dependent mix of these fluctuations , yielding anisotropies in the temperature of the microwave sky which are compatible with observation .",
    "inflation apparently provides a natural framework in which one can simultaneously understand both the large - scale regularity of the universe _ and _ its small - scale irregularity .",
    "inflation is not a single model , but rather a whole collection of scenarios which fit into the above framework .",
    "the only necessary ingredients are : ( i ) a specification of the field content , which allows a division into ` light ' and ` heavy ' fields ; ( ii ) a background evolution @xmath5 which gives rise to @xmath3 with the hubble parameter @xmath6 slowly varying ; and ( iii ) a rule for generating @xmath0 from the light bosonic fields .",
    "this prescription is rather general and implies that many models ( perhaps with wildly different and mutually incompatible microphysics ) may simultaneously be compatible with the observational data , since they may make equivalent predictions for the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we must expect that it will be difficult to learn about the microscopic physics which was operative during the very early universe : it will almost certainly be insufficient simply to study the spectrum of @xmath0 . in order to distinguish between wildly different models of the early universe it is necessary to find another source of information .",
    "fortunately , any detailed model of the inflationary era does not merely predict the spectrum of @xmath0 ; it also implies a subtle but calculable network of correlations between the higher - order moments .",
    "these moments collectively measure the so - called non - gaussianity of @xmath0 and arise from interactions among the quanta of the @xmath0-field and the other constituents of the early universe .",
    "non - gaussian effects from interactions of @xmath0 quanta have been extensively investigated over the last few years , with the hope that observations of such effects may be able to discriminate between different models for physics in the early universe @xcite . however , more is possible .",
    "interactions do not only imply non - gaussian statistics in the three- and higher @xmath7-point correlation functions : they also imply _ quantum _ corrections to all correlation functions , and in particular the power spectrum or two - point function .",
    "it is possible that such corrections may be large in their own right , demanding that they be taken into account in accurate analyses of the observational data , as recently suggested by sloth @xcite .",
    "regardless of their exact magnitude , by searching for signatures of such quantum corrections in the power spectrum and correlating the results with predictions for non - gaussian statistics in the higher @xmath7-point functions we obtain a more sensitive test of physics during inflation .",
    "a second powerful motivation for studying loop corrections is a simple point of principle . the tree - level formula for the spectrum of @xmath0 is widely used to make predictions for the amplitude and scale - dependence of fluctuations generated in a very large class of early universe scenarios .",
    "before deciding what degree of credence we should attach to any of these predictions , it is necessary to thoroughly investigate whether the tree - level amplitude is a genuine approximation to the full quantum result .    in this paper ,",
    "the prospects for detecting quantum corrections to the power spectrum are assessed in the simplest model of inflationary physics , that of inflation with a single scalar @xmath8 and arbitrary potential @xmath9 . in view of the importance of accurate comparison with the precision measurements which are becoming available ,",
    "this issue has already attracted considerable attention .",
    "early work by mukhanov , abramo & brandenberger @xcite and abramo & woodard @xcite demonstrated that significant effects were possible ( see also unruh @xcite ) .",
    "later estimates of loop effects were made in a large number of models @xcite , even at two - loop order @xcite .",
    "recently , sloth @xcite determined the full fourth - order action for einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field and used this to estimate the one - loop correction to the power spectrum of scalar field fluctuations . although one would navely expect the loop correction to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter during inflation , sloth s calculation yielded a significant cumulative effect ( as large as 70% in some models ) which could affect the precision determination of cosmological parameters from cmb experiments",
    "the unexpectedly large size of the loop correction in this estimate is due to an amplification by @xmath12 , the total number of e - folds of inflation which occur .",
    "since @xmath12 can be very large in models where inflation begins at around the planck scale , it may dramatically modify the predictions of nave dimensional analysis .",
    "this paper attempts to address these issues using a formalism similar to that applied by sloth @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to previous analyses , the estimate is divided into two parts .",
    "first , the one - loop correction to the power spectrum of field fluctuations is computed soon after horizon exit , using the slow - roll approximation to control the calculation .",
    "this correction is not observable by itself ; in a second step , it must be combined with other correlators of the fields to yield the one - loop correction to the power spectrum of the observable perturbation @xmath0 long after horizon exit .",
    "the correct combination can be computed using the @xmath13 formula @xcite .",
    "this two - step process has several advantages .",
    "we shall see that the loop correction is generally afflicted by divergences at late times and on large scales .",
    "the @xmath13 formalism naturally resums these late - time divergences into time evolution , which allows the slow - roll approximation to be kept under control . on the other hand ,",
    "the divergences on large scales can be controlled by performing the calculation within a finite box . in analogy with the late - time divergences , it has recently been shown by byrnes _",
    "_ @xcite that these divergences can be resummed into spatial variation on large scales .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the technical issue of computing loop corrections go the power spectrum of field fluctuations .",
    "this calculation involves the application of standard methods from quantum field theory , adapted to the case of an expanding spacetime . on the other hand ,",
    "the assembly of field correlators into @xmath0 correlators is an essentially classical calculation using the @xmath13 formula . for clarity",
    ", this calculation will be presented separately elsewhere @xcite .    in  [",
    "sec : inflation ] the background evolution and perturbation theory of the single scalar field are briefly described .",
    "the perturbations are characterized ( as in more complex cases ) by cubic and higher self - interactions which involve the time derivative of the perturbation .",
    "this has important consequences for the calculation of quantum corrections .",
    "these corrections are introduced in  [ sec : quantum ] . in ",
    "[ sec : quantum - oneloop ] a path - integral expression for a general one - loop , single - vertex correction to the power spectrum is given in the schwinger formalism , and in  [ sec : quantum - derivatives ] the question of deriving a correct path integral expression for theories with time - derivative interactions is considered . in such cases",
    "the correct path - integral formula is well - known to contain a _ ghost _ field , whose quanta do not appear in physical states but circulate in the loops which give rise to quantum corrections .",
    "the feynman rules for this theory are written down in  [ sec : quantum - rules ] . in  [ sec : one - point ] the assembled formalism is used to compute the leading radiative correction to the one - point function of the field .",
    "this is of interest in its own right , but also provides a simple setting in which some subtle features of the calculational machinery can be resolved .",

    "the simplest microphysical model capable of supporting an inflationary epoch consists of einstein gravity coupled to a single scalar field @xmath8 with potential @xmath9 , which can be taken to be arbitrary except that it must allow inflation for some values of @xmath8 .",
    "the field @xmath8 is known as the inflaton .",
    "the combined action for this system is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the metric determinant , @xmath26 is the product of the spacetime coordinate differentials , and @xmath27 is the spacetime ricci curvature .",
    "the background field @xmath8 is taken to be spatially homogeneous and the background metric is parametrized by the scale factor @xmath2 , given in .",
    "the evolution of @xmath2 is determined by the friedmann equation @xmath28 where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath8 obeys the homogeneous klein  gordon equation @xmath29 in which a prime @xmath30 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the condition that inflation occurs is @xmath3 , or @xmath31 , where the parameter @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 using eqs .",
    " one can show that an equivalent definition is @xmath34 .    when @xmath32 obeys the stronger condition @xmath35 , the rate of change of @xmath8 is negligible in comparison with the expansion rate @xmath11 .",
    "in this case one says that the field is slowly rolling .",
    "although slow - roll is not mandatory for inflation to occur , the near scale - invariance of the power spectrum imprinted on the scales which are observed in microwave background experiments suggests that slow - roll was approximately satisfied if the cmb perturbation has an inflationary origin .",
    "when @xmath35 applies , perturbation theory in @xmath32 and related small quantities is known as the slow - roll approximation . in this paper , we compute all effects to leading order in @xmath32 .      now consider small spatially - dependent perturbations in the inflaton , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the homogeneous background evolution and @xmath38 obeys the smallness condition @xmath39 . since @xmath8 dominates the energy density of the universe by assumption , any perturbation in @xmath8 will lead to a perturbation in the metric .",
    "these perturbations can be parametrized by a scalar @xmath12 ( the lapse ) , a spatial vector @xmath40 ( the shift ) , and a spatial metric @xmath41 , @xmath42 because of general coordinate invariance , not all choices of @xmath43 lead to different configurations of the gravitational field .",
    "this redundancy is removed by fixing a gauge",
    ". we will choose to work in the spatially flat gauge , where @xmath41 is given by its background value @xmath44 .",
    "having done so , the metric functions @xmath12 and @xmath40 are completely determined in terms of @xmath38 by the constraints implicit in the einstein equations .",

    "one should identify the @xmath333 mode with the spatial average of @xmath38 within this patch .",

    "we now turn to the central purpose of this paper , the computation of the leading loop correction to the two - point function @xmath336 .",
    "it is first necessary to decide which classes of diagrams are to be included in the computation . in general",

    "therefore , provided @xmath35 and there are no large logarithms which can compensate for small slow - roll parameters , the expectation value will be dominated by the lowest - order part of the first diagram .",
    "this is _ opposite _ to the case considered by sloth @xcite , where a large logarithm was used to compensate for the smallness of @xmath32 . in this regime",
    "the first diagram will be dominated by its _ subleading _ slow - roll part , and for consistency one should also take into account sub - leading slow - roll terms from the second diagram , and possibly from other sources . in the present paper",
    ", we wish to use the slow - roll approximation to simplify the calculation and therefore we will retain only the contribution from the leading part of the first diagram .",
    "the question of when this is a good approximation , together with a more general analysis of any possible large logarithms , will be postponed to another publication @xcite .",
    "the relevant vertices here come from the @xmath339 and @xmath340 terms in the ghost action .",
    "there is no contribution from the @xmath341 interaction because this involves three ghost fields , which must appear in loops , and at one - loop order there is always one ghost field which is left unpaired .",
    "therefore this term can be disregarded , although it would play a role in a two- or higher - loop calculation . to determine the @xmath261 contribution explicitly ,",

    "we are computing to leading order in slow - roll , so the term involving @xmath343 can be discarded , because eq .   shows that it is proportional to the slow - roll parameter @xmath344 , whereas the leading terms in the fourth - order interaction are @xmath64 .",
    "the relevant ghost diagrams are    ( _ 1 ) ( _ 2 ) _ + .",

    "the ghost diagrams have therefore entirely cancelled out in both the one- and two - point functions .",
    "this leads to expressions which agree with those reported in refs .",

    "although this issue deserves more detailed attention , at two - loop order and above one can presumably expect the factors of @xmath346 to combine to give non - vanishing contributions .",
    "this will apparently occur whenever there are an even number of ghost propagators in the diagram .      as in the one - point calculation ,",
