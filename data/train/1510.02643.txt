    "then @xmath161 is a circuit of @xmath35 . on the other hand , by symmetry and the analysis in the last paragraph we have @xmath162 .",
    "so @xmath161 is not a circuit of @xmath69 , a contradiction .        for convenience , theorem [ 1-con ]",

    "* @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath1-isomorphic .",
    "* @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath1-isomorphic to subdivisions of @xmath28 , where the edge set of an ear of @xmath24 is also the edge set of an ear of @xmath25 . *",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath1-isomorphic to subdivisions of @xmath37 for some @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where the edge set of an ear of @xmath24 is also the edge set of an ear of @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath40 , the @xmath41 ears in @xmath24 having the same ends also have the same ends in @xmath25 . *",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath1-isomorphic to the graphs pictured in figure [ figure 1 ] .",
    "if some loop @xmath32 of @xmath24 is also a loop of @xmath25 , then by corollary [ loop - iso ] we have that @xmath163 and @xmath33 are 2-isomorphic .",
    "so @xmath24 and @xmath25 are 2-isomorphic . moreover",
    ", when some link of @xmath24 is a loop of @xmath25 , lemma [ loop - case ] implies that ( 4 ) holds .",
    "therefore , we may assume that neither @xmath24 nor @xmath25 has loops . by whitney",
    "s 2-isomorphism theorem we can further assume that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are connected , and each series class of @xmath31 is an ear of @xmath31 for each @xmath129 . using lemma [ ear - to - ear ] we may assume that a subset of @xmath164 is the edge set of an ear of @xmath24 if and only if it is the edge set of an ear of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we may assume that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are cosimple .",

    "when @xmath166 , lemmas [ n<4 ] and [ n=4 ] imply that the result holds .",
    "we claim that when @xmath167 we have that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are 2-isomorphic .",
    "when @xmath168 , the claim follows from lemma [ n=5 ] .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath169 .",
    "for each edge @xmath56 , by lemma [ contract - l ] ( 3 ) we have @xmath98 . by induction @xmath57 and @xmath58",
