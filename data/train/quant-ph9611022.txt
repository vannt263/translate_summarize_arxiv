    "the classical model corresponding to eq([map ] ) is closely related to the model in reference @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and the parametric gain is @xmath8 . the parameter @xmath9 is simply a scaling parameter and the crucial control parameters are the parametric gain @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath12 , easily achievable in experiment as we show below , this model reduces to that discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "the origin is then a saddle . if however @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , the origin is elliptically stable .",
    "the bifurcation diagram is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the origin is elliptically stable in the regions bounded by the solid curves @xmath15 and labelled @xmath16 .",
    "away from the origin an infinite number of period-1 orbits lie on lines with a slope of @xmath17 , independent of @xmath18 as in the original model .",
    "however the radius at which the period-1 orbits lie does depend on @xmath18 , and is determined by the equation @xmath19 as @xmath18 is increased the period-1 orbits move inwards collapsing on the origin and changing its stability .",
    "those in the odd quadrants are always unstable . in",
    "the even quadrants a finite number ( maybe zero ) lying closest to the origin are stable depending on whether @xmath20 they loose stability on the curves @xmath21 , shown as dashed ( for n=-1,0,1 ) in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the various parameter regions are labelled with a sequence of @xmath22s and @xmath23s standing for elliptic or hyperbolic .",
    "the first letter refers to the stability of the origin and the subsequent letters to the stability of the pairs of period-1 orbits in the 2nd and 4th quadrants starting with those closest to the origin and moving out .",
    "since the elliptic period-1 orbits always occur closest to the origin in the region @xmath24,for instance , only one pair of period-1 orbits are elliptically stable .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show typical poincar sections of the classical dynamics for various values of @xmath10 , and @xmath25 .",
    "note the transition to almost global chaos for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "to compare the quantum and classical dynamics we compute the mean energy as a function of the number of kicks . in the quantum case",
    "we assume the oscillator is initially prepared in the vibrational ground state , while in the classical case we use an initial gaussian phase - space distribution with the same moments as the initial quantum state .",
    "the detailed results are given in reference @xcite , which we summarise here . in the classical case , the average energy saturates at an almost time independent value , as the initial distribution becomes spread around the period - one fixed points .",
    "the time taken to reach the saturation value is longer for an initial state in the regular region , than for one located in a chaotic region . in the quantum case ,",
    "the mean energy follows the classical for a short time , but instead of saturating at an almost stationary value , continues to oscillate with a characteristic collapse and revival envelope .",
    "the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the classical system is marked in the quantum system by a transition from a regular collapse and revival sequence to a highly irregular and more rapid collapse and revival sequence .",
    "this is due to the fact that a state localised in the chaotic region has support on very many quasi - energy eigenstates , compared to a state localised in a regular region .",
    "we now show how this system may be realised in a trapped ion experiment . following filho and vogel@xcite",
    "we first consider an ion trapped at an antinode of an optical standing wave tuned to the atomic frequency , the carrier frequency . in an interaction picture at frequency @xmath26 the interaction hamiltonian is , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rabi frequency and @xmath29 is the lamb - dicke parameter .",
    "if the ion is first prepared in an eigenstate of @xmath30 by the application of a @xmath31 pulse , it will remain in this state . in that case",
    "the vibrational motion experiences a linear and a nonlinear phase shift .",
    "the interaction is precisely the kind required to realise @xmath32 , with @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the time for which the standing wave pulse is applied .    in order to realise the parametric kick we use a raman interaction with two laser pulses ,",
    "one tuned to the first lower sideband , the other to the first upper sideband .",
    "this scheme has been successfully used by wineland and coworkers to prepare the ion in a squeezed vibrational state@xcite . in this case",
    "the interaction hamiltonian , in an interaction picture at frequency @xmath26 , is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the rabi frequency for each of the raman pulses , each of which is detuned from the atomic transition by @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "the lamb - dicke parameter for the raman transition is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the wave vector difference for the two raman beams and @xmath43 is the rms fluctuations of position in the ground state of the trap .",
    "note that this hamiltonian is independent of the ion electronic state .",
    "the ion evolves according to the parametric kick transformation with @xmath44 for a raman pulse of duration @xmath35 . in summary , we first prepare the ion electronic state by the application of a @xmath31 pulse , then apply the pulse at the carrier frequency , followed by the raman parametric kick pulses .",
    "pulses at the carrier frequency and the raman pulses then alternate to effect each kick .",
    "a particular advantage of this realisation is that it is easy to read out the energy of the vibrational motion at any stage .",
    "if we reprepare the ion in the ground electronic state at the end of the carrier frequency pulse , its evolution will be dominated by the first term in eq([ham ] ) .",
    "this is a qnd measurement interaction for the vibrational quantum number .",
    "it causes the bloch vector describing the two level system to precess around the x - axis by an angle proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "the probability to find the atom in the ground state a time @xmath46 after the last squeezing pulse is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "a set of readouts of the atomic state a time after an appropriate number of kicks thus enables a moment of the photon number to be constructed directly .",
    "this is similar to the scheme used by wineland and coworkers to observe the jaynes - cummings collapse and revival sequence@xcite .    in figures",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we plot @xmath49 for the same two initial states and parameter values as discussed in reference @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , the initial state is localised in a classically regular region of phase space . a regular collapse and revival sequence is evident in the quantum case ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) . in figure [ fig4 ] however , we have the case of an initial state localised in the chaotic part of the classical phase space , leading to an irregular revival sequence . in both cases",
    "the corresponding classical moment is shown as well .",
    "we can estimate reasonable values of the parameters @xmath50 from recent experiments on trapped ions . from meekhof et al.@xcite , typical values are @xmath51 for an interaction time of @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 .",
    "it is then apparent that the parameter values of interest are achievable in an experiment .",

    "<S> we show how a nonlinear chaotic system , the parametrically kicked nonlinear oscillator , may be realised in the dynamics of a trapped , laser - cooled ion , interacting with a sequence of standing wave pulses . unlike the original optical scheme [ g.j.milburn and c.a.holmes , phys . </S>",

    "<S> this should permit an experimental test of one of the quantum signatures of chaos ; irregular collapse and revival dynamics of the average vibrational energy .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now well understood that the quantum dynamics of a classically chaotic system will show major departures from the classical motion on a suitable time scale@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> systems which classically show chaotic diffusion of a slow momentum - like variable , will cease to show diffusion after the break - time. in this region , the momentum distribution is found to be exponentially localised , rather than gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> one system which demonstrates this phenomenon is a laser cooled atom moving under the dipole force of a standing wave with periodically modulated nodal positions @xcite recently this prediction achieved experimental confirmation in the work of raizen and coworkers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum and classical dynamics can also differ through the existence of quantum tunnelling between fixed points of the classical poincar section , a phenomenon which has not yet been observed . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider yet another way in which quantum and classical motion can differ for systems which classically do not show diffusion . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the transition to chaos in the classical system is manifested in the quantum case by a transition from regular collapse and revivals of average values with time , to a highly irregular collapse and revival sequence@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such a system is the parametrically kicked nonlinear oscillator@xcite . a nonlinear oscillator , in which the frequency is linearly dependent on energy , is periodically kicked by a parametric amplification process , which momentarily turns the origin into a hyperbolic fixed point . the classical dynamics of this system exhibits regions of regular and chaotic motion in the poincar section .    </S>",
    "<S> in reference @xcite it was proposed to realise this system using a combination of a kerr optical nonlinearity and an optical parametric amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the required optical nonlinearity is usually rather small and accompanied by a large amount of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , it is unlikely that an optical version will ever show interesting quantum features . </S>",
    "<S> however the system does show some interesting classical chaotic behaviour including a strange attractor in which unstable periodic orbits can be stabilised by ogy control@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that a much more promising realisation of the quantum version of this system may be achieved in the dynamics of a single trapped laser cooled ion interacting with a sequence of pulsed optical fields . furthermore the dynamics may be monitored with high quantum efficiency using the qnd vibrational energy measurement scheme proposed by filho and vogel@xcite together with the now standard method of detection on a strong probe transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the vibrational motion of a single trapped ion . in the absence of laser pulses , </S>",
    "<S> the ion executes simple harmonic motion in the quadratic trap potential . </S>",
    "<S> as we show below , a suitable sequence of laser pulses enables us to realise the nonlinear quantum dynamics specified by the map @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes an intensity dependent rotation in the oscillator phase plane while @xmath2 describes a parametric amplification kick . in these expressions the operators @xmath3 are the ladder operators for the quantised harmonic motion of the trapped ion , which may be written in terms of the dimensionless position and momentum operators @xmath4 , by @xmath5 . </S>"
