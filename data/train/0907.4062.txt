    "recent measurements of high-@xmath1 hadrons produced in the beam fragmentation region in @xmath2 collisions at rhic @xcite allow to reach the smallest values of bjorken @xmath0 in the nucleus and thus to reach maximal coherence effects leading eventually to nuclear suppression .",
    "observed suppression is usually interpreted within the models based on color glass condensate ( cgc ) .",
    "however , such an interpretation misses a global applicability .",
    "for example , a similar suppression like at rhic was measured also in @xmath3 collisions at sps where no effects of coherence are possible .",
    "the rise of the suppression with feynman @xmath4 for hadrons produced in @xmath3 collisions at sps @xcite or for the drell - yan ( dy ) pairs at fnal @xcite has a similar pattern as seen at rhic .",
    "all these examples and another reactions treated in @xcite favor the same large-@xmath0 mechanism independently of the energy and type of reaction .",
    "such a common mechanism was proposed in @xcite where large-@xmath4 nuclear suppression was shown to be caused by the energy conservation in multiple parton rescatterings .",
    "this mechanism is a leading twist effect giving rise to the breakdown of qcd factorization and exhibits also the @xmath4-scaling @xcite .",
    "another consequence of this treatment discussed in this paper is the manifestation of nuclear effects also at midrapidities , i.e. at large @xmath5 .",
    "we expect a suppression pattern similar to that at large @xmath4 and the nucleus - to - nucleon ratio below one . similarly to @xmath4-scaling at forward rapidities @xmath6-scaling of this effect is predicted .    in this paper",
    "we further exploit proposed model @xcite to analyze and quantify the nuclear suppression at large @xmath0 for a variety of processes occurring in @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions .",
    "in any hard reaction in the limit @xmath9 gluon radiation is forbidden by the energy conservation . then the probability to have a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) @xmath10 between the leading parton and rest of the system , where the sudakov suppression factor @xmath11 @xcite",
    ".    suppression at @xmath9 can thus be formulated in terms of multiple interactions of projectile partons with the nucleus .",
    "each of multiple interactions produces an extra suppression factor @xmath12 and corresponding weight factors are given by the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "then , in terms of the nuclear thickness function @xmath13 and the effective cross section @xmath14 @xcite , the cross sections of hard reaction on a nuclear target @xmath15 at impact parameter @xmath16 and on a nucleon @xmath17 are related as @xcite , = e^- _ eff t_a(b ) _",

    "the parton cross sections @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ 80 ] ) are calculated in the light - cone ( lc ) dipole approach @xcite . for parton distribution functions we use the parametrization from @xcite .",
    "fragmentation functions were taken from @xcite .",
    "as first shown in @xcite the effective projectile quark ( gluon ) distribution correlates with the target and corresponding quark ( gluon ) distribution in the nucleus reads f^(a)_q(g)/n(x , q_t^2 ) = cf_q(g)/n(x , q_t^2 ) .",

    "( [ 100 ] ) is fixed by the gottfried sum rule .",
    "in 2004 the brahms collaboration @xcite observed a significant nuclear suppression of @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "much stronger nuclear effects was found later on by the star collaboration @xcite for @xmath27 production at @xmath28 .",
    "all these data are consistent with model calculations @xcite .",
    "a strong rise of suppression with @xmath19 reflects much smaller survival probability @xmath12 of a lrg at larger @xmath0 .",
    "since parton energy loss is proportional to the initial energy the energy conservation restrictions in multiple parton rescatterings should also lead to @xmath0-scaling of the nuclear effects .",
    "a similarity of suppression at different energies and pseudorapidities was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of the energy conservation in multiple parton rescatterings occurs at midrapidities . here",
