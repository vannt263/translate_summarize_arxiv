    "recent experimental , numerical and theoretical studies signify the existence of deviations from the well - known kolmogorov scaling behavior . the scaling behavior of the velocity fluctuations with exponents , which values are different from kolmogorov ones , is known as anomalous and is associated with intermittency phenomenon @xcite . even thought the understanding of the intermittency and anomalous scaling within the theoretical description of the fluid turbulence on basis of the `` first principles '' , i.e. , on the stochastic navier - stokes equation , still remains an open problem , considerable progress has been achieved in the studies of the simplified model systems which share some important properties of the real turbulence .    the crucial role in these studies",
    "is played by models of advected passive scalar field @xcite .",
    "maybe the most known model of this type is a simple model of a passive scalar quantity advected by a random gaussian velocity field , white in time and self - similar in space , the so - called kraichnan s rapid - change model @xcite .",
    "it was shown by both natural and numerical experimental investigations that the deviations from the predictions of the classical ko phenomenological theory is even more strongly displayed for a passively advected scalar field than for the velocity field itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "at the same time , the problem of passive advection is much more easier to be consider from theoretical point of view .",
    "there , for the first time , the anomalous scaling was established on the basis of a microscopic model @xcite , and corresponding anomalous exponents was calculated within controlled approximations ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .    in paper @xcite the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) and operator - product expansion ( ope )",
    "were used in the systematic investigation of the rapid - change model .",
    "it was shown that within the field theoretic approach the anomalous scaling is related to the very existence of so - called `` dangerous '' composite operators with negative critical dimensions in ope ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "important advantages of the rg approach are its universality and calculational efficiency : a regular systematic perturbation expansion for the anomalous exponents was constructed , similar to the well - known @xmath8-expansion in the theory of phase transitions .",
    "afterwards , various generalized descendants of the kraichnan model , namely , models with inclusion of large and small scale anisotropy @xcite , compressibility @xcite and finite correlation time of the velocity field @xcite were studied by the field theoretic approach .",
    "general conclusion is : the anomalous scaling , which is the most important feature of the kraichnan rapid change model , remains valid for all generalized models .    in paper",
    "@xcite the problem of a passive scalar advected by the gaussian self - similar velocity field with finite correlation time @xcite was studied by the field theoretic rg method . there",
    ", the systematic study of the possible scaling regimes and anomalous behavior was present at one - loop level .",
    "the two - loop corrections to the anomalous exponents were obtained in @xcite . in paper @xcite the influence of compressibility on the problem studied in @xcite was analyzed . in what follows",
    ", we shall continue with the investigation of this model from the point of view of the influence of compressibility on the stability of the scaling regimes within two - loop approximation .",
    "it can lead to sufficient restrictions of the parameter space where the stable fixed points can exist .",
    "this , as we shall see rather complicated task , is the first nontrivial step on the way to understand the influence of the compressibility of the system on the two - loop corrections to anomalous dimensions of the measurable quantities @xcite .",
    "we consider the advection of a passive scalar field @xmath9 which is described by the stochastic equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the coefficient of molecular diffusivity ( hereafter all parameters with a subscript @xmath14 denote bare parameters of unrenormalized theory ; see below ) , @xmath15 is the laplace operator , and @xmath16 is a gaussian random noise with zero mean and correlation function @xmath17 where parentheses @xmath18 hereafter denote average over corresponding statistical ensemble .",
    "the noise maintains the steady - state of the system but the concrete form of the correlator is not essential .",
    "the only condition which must be fulfilled by the function @xmath19 is that it must decrease rapidly for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes an integral scale related to the stirring .",
    "the velocity field @xmath22 obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and correlator @xcite @xmath23,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the wave number , @xmath25 is frequency , @xmath26 is the dimensionality of the @xmath27 space . in",
    "what follows , we shall work with compressible velocity field which is demonstrated by the form of the tensor structure of the correlator ( [ corv ] ) , namely , it consists of two parts : the standard transverse projector @xmath28 , and the longitudinal projector @xmath29 which is related to compressibility .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is a free parameter .",
    "the value @xmath31 corresponds to the divergence - free ( incompressible ) advecting velocity field .",
    "the function @xmath32 is chosen as follows @xcite @xmath33 the correlator ( [ corrvelo ] ) is related to the energy spectrum via the frequency integral @xmath34 it means that the coupling constant @xmath35 ( more precisely @xmath36 @xcite ) and the exponent @xmath0 describe the equal - time velocity correlator or , equivalently , energy spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , the constant @xmath37 and the second exponent @xmath1 are related to the frequency @xmath38 which characterizes the mode @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in our notation , the value @xmath39 corresponds to the well - known kolmogorov `` five - thirds law '' for the spatial statistics of velocity field , and @xmath40 corresponds to the kolmogorov frequency .",
    "simple dimensional analysis shows that the charges @xmath35 and @xmath37 are related to the characteristic ultraviolet ( uv ) momentum scale @xmath41 ( of the order of inverse kolmogorov length ) by @xmath42    in the end of this section , let us briefly discuss two important limits of the considered model ( [ corv ] ) , ( [ corrvelo ] ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first of them is so - called rapid - change model limit when @xmath43 and @xmath44 const , @xmath45 and the second one is so - called quenched ( time - independent or frozen ) velocity field limit which is defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 const , @xmath48 here the velocity correlator is independent of time in the @xmath49 representation .",
    "the stochastic problem ( [ scalar1])-([corv ] ) is equivalent to the field theoretic model of the set of fields @xmath50 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with action functional @xmath51^{-1 } v_j(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int dt\\,d^d{\\bf x}\\,\\ , \\theta^{\\prime}\\left[-\\partial_t \\theta - v_i\\partial_i\\theta+\\nu_0\\triangle\\theta \\right ] , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in what follows , unimportant term related to the noise ( [ correlator ] ) is omitted , @xmath52 is an auxiliary scalar field , and summations are implied over the vector indices .",

    "the model under consideration is logarithmic at @xmath69 ( the coupling constants @xmath35 , and @xmath37 are dimensionless ) , therefore the uv divergences in the correlation functions have the form of the poles in @xmath70 , and their linear combinations .    the crucial role in the renormalization of the model is played by the total canonical dimension of an arbitrary one - particle irreducible correlation ( green ) function @xmath71 .",
    "it plays the role of the formal index of the uv divergence and it is given as follows @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the numbers of corresponding fields entering into the function @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the canonical momentum dimension and the canonical frequency dimension of the function @xmath74 , respectively , and summation over all types of fields is implied . in what follows , we shall use the definitions of the canonical dimensions of the fields @xmath58 as they are given in @xcite .",

    "the issue of interest are especially multiplicatively renormalizable equal - time two - point quantities @xmath94 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the influence of compressibility on the anomalous scaling ( the second stage of the rg analysis ) will be studied in the subsequent paper .    in",
    "what follows we shall work with two - loop approximation .",
    "but the calculation of higher - order corrections is more difficult in the models with turbulent velocity field with finite correlation time than in the cases with @xmath118-correlations in time .",
    "it is related to the fact that the diagrams for the finite correlated case involve two different dispersion laws , namely , @xmath119 for the scalar field and @xmath120 for the velocity field which complicates situation even in the one - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "but , as was discussed in @xcite , this difficulty can be avoided by the calculation of all renormalization constants in an arbitrary specific choice of the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 that guarantees uv finiteness of the feynman diagrams . from the calculational point of view",
    "the most suitable choice is to put @xmath121 and leave @xmath0 arbitrary .",
    "thus , the knowledge of the renormalization constants for the special choice @xmath121 is sufficient to obtain all important quantities as the @xmath122-functions , @xmath123-functions , coordinates of fixed points , and the critical dimensions .",
    "but such possibility is not automatic in general . in the model under consideration , it is the consequence of an analysis which shows that in the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme , which is used in what follows , all needed anomalous dimensions are independent of the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the two - loop approximation .",
    "but in the three - loop approximation this dependence can simply appear @xcite .",
    "now let us continue with renormalization of the model . the relation @xmath124 , where @xmath125 stands for the complete set of bare parameters and @xmath126 stands for renormalized one , leads to the relation @xmath127 for the generating functional of connected green functions .",
    "by application of the operator @xmath128 at fixed @xmath125 on both sides of the latest equation one obtains the basic rg differential equation @xmath129 where @xmath130 represents operation @xmath131 written in the renormalized variables .",

    "epsf    thus , @xmath147 , and @xmath137 are found from the requirement that the uv divergences are canceled in ( [ dyson ] ) , and ( [ vrcholl ] ) after substitution @xmath148 .",

    "we are interested in the answer on the following question : how can the two - loop approximation change the picture of the scaling regimes discussed in @xcite ?    in what follows , we shall try to study possible scaling regimes in detail .",

    "the renormalization of the velocity field is absent at all as a consequence of the fact that @xmath178 at all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "it can be also seen directly by the corresponding manipulations with our @xmath122-functions ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are coming to the one - loop results of @xcite ( in the rapid - change model limit ) , namely @xmath179 where again @xmath180 .",

    "how does it work ?",
    "the answer is the following .",
    "if we continuously increase the value of the parameter @xmath7 , the region of stability of the fixed point defined by the inequalities ( [ cond2 ] ) increases too .",
    "this restriction vanishes completely when @xmath7 reaches the `` critical '' value @xmath6 . in this rather specific situation",
    "the two - loop influence on the region of stability of fixed point defined by condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is exactly zero .",
    "then , if the value of parameter @xmath7 increases further , the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) appears again , and restriction on @xmath0 becomes stronger when @xmath7 tends , in principle , to infinity . in this limit @xmath227 . on the other hand",
    ", it must be stressed that in our model only relatively small values of @xmath7 are allowed ( @xmath228 ) .",

    "another complication , which defends to analyze the problem in general , is related to the fact that contrary to the incompressible case when one has additional condition , namely @xmath245 , no such condition exists in compressible case under consideration . as a result ,",
