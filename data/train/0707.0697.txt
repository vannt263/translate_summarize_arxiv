    "for more than 20 years , after the discovery in 1964 that the long lived neutral kaon could decay to the same @xmath12 final state as the short lived one  @xcite , demonstrating that the mass eigenstates of the neutral kaons consist of a mixture of even and odd eigenstates under the combined operation of charge conjugation and parity , no other manifestation of cp violation was detected despite intensive experimental investigation . in the meanwhile",
    "the discovery of the three families of quarks and the development of the standard model ( sm ) made it plausible that cp violation was in fact a general property of the weak interactions , originating from a single non - trivial phase in the ckm matrix of the coefficients involved in flavour changing transitions .",
    "it was in particular realized that , barring accidental cancellations , cp violation should be relevant not only in meson - antimeson mixing but also in decays ( direct cp violation ) and in so called mixing induced transitions .",
    "two major experimental breakthroughs have since taken place . in the late 1990s , following an earlier indication by na31  @xcite , the na48 and ktev experiments firmly established the existence of direct cp violation  @xcite by measuring a non - zero value of the parameter @xmath13 parameter in @xmath14 decays . more recently",
    "the b - factory experiments babar and belle discovered a series of cp violating effects in the system of the neutral @xmath15 meson  @xcite .    in order to explore possible non - sm enhancements to heavy - quark loops , which are at the core of direct cp - violating processes , all possible manifestations of direct cp violation have to be studied experimentally . in kaon physics , besides the already investigated parameter @xmath13 , the most promising complementary observables are the rates of gim - suppressed flavour - changing neutral current decays @xmath16 , and the charge asymmetry between @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays into @xmath17 .",
    "it is difficult to constrain the fundamental parameters of the theory using measurements of direct cp violation in decay amplitudes due to the presence of non - perturbative hadron effects .",
    "still , an intense theoretical programme is under way to improve predictions , aiming to allow the direct cp violation measurements to be used as quantitative constraints on the sm .",
    "the @xmath18 matrix element squared is conventionally parameterized  @xcite by a polynomial expansion rescattering should be included into the decay amplitude  @xcite .",
    "these effects , despite being charge - symmetric , may still contribute to the interpretation of the results , as will be discussed below . ]",

    ", the slope asymmetry is expected to be strongly enhanced with respect to the asymmetry of integrated decay rates  @xcite .",
    "a recent full next - to - leading order chpt computation  @xcite predicts @xmath36 to be of the order of @xmath37 within the sm .",
    "another sm calculation  @xcite predicts the asymmetry in the @xmath2 decay to be of the order of @xmath38 ( in agreement with  @xcite within the errors ) .",
    "theoretical calculations involving processes beyond the sm  @xcite allow a wider range of @xmath36 , including substantial enhancements up to a few @xmath39 .",
    "in the past years , several experiments have searched for the cp violating slope asymmetry in both @xmath40 and @xmath41 decay modes by collecting samples of @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays  @xcite .",
    "these measurements set upper limits on @xmath36 at the level of a few @xmath42 , limited by systematic uncertainties .",
    "the primary goal of the na48/2 experiment at the cern sps is the measurement of the slope charge asymmetries @xmath36 in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes with a sensitivity at least one order of magnitude better than previous experiments .",
    "the new level of precision can explore effects , albeit larger than the sm predictions , induced by new physics , and is achieved by using a novel measurement technique based on simultaneous @xmath3 and @xmath4 beams overlapping in space .",
    "measurements of @xmath36 in both decay modes , performed with approximately half of the na48/2 data sample have been published  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the final results , superseding these earlier results .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 1 the experimental setup",
    "is described .",
    "section 2 contains the description of the method developed for the measurement of the slope difference which is common to both decay modes , and which aims to cancel first order systematic biases .",
    "the analyses of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay modes are discussed in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "discussion of the results follows in section 5 .",
    "a high precision measurement of @xmath36 ( at the level of @xmath39 ) requires a dedicated experimental approach together with collection of very large data samples .",
    "a novel beam line providing for the first time two simultaneous charged beams of opposite signs superimposed in space over the decay fiducial volume was designed and built in the high intensity hall ( ecn3 ) at the cern sps .",
    "the beam line is a key element of the experiment , as it allows decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be recorded at the same time , and therefore leads to cancellation of several systematic uncertainties for the charge asymmetry measurement .",
    "regular alternation of magnetic fields in all the beam line elements was adopted , which contributed to symmetrization of the average geometrical acceptance for @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays .",
    "the layout of the beams and detectors is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "the setup is described in a right - handed orthogonal coordinate system with the @xmath43 axis directed downstream along the beam , and the @xmath44 axis directed vertically up .",
    "thus the horizontal @xmath45 coordinate is such that the negative ( positive ) @xmath45 point to the salve ( jura ) mountains .",
    "the salve / jura notation is used in the following analysis to denote the spectrometer magnet polarity .",
    "the beams are produced by 400 gev/@xmath46 protons ( delivered from the cern sps with a duty cycle of 4.8  s/16.8  s ) impinging on a beryllium target of 40  cm length and 2  mm diameter .",
    "both beams leave the target on axis at zero production angle , thereby ensuring that their source is geometrically similar and that the @xmath47 flux ratio remains stable .",
    "it was demonstrated that the small residual difference of @xmath3 and @xmath4 momentum spectra produces a negligible effect on the measurement .",
    "charged particles with momenta @xmath48 gev/@xmath46 are selected in a charge - symmetric way by an achromatic system of four dipole magnets with zero total deflection ( ` achromat ' ) , which splits the two beams in the vertical plane and then recombines them on a common axis .",
    "then the beams pass through a defining collimator and a series of four quadrupoles designed to produce horizontal and vertical charge - symmetric focusing of the beams towards the detector .",
    "finally the two beams are again split in the vertical plane and recombined by a second achromat , where three stations of a micromegas - type  @xcite detector operating in tpc mode form a kaon beam spectrometer kabes  @xcite ( not used in the present analyses ) .    after passing through the cleaning and final collimators ,",
    "the beams enter the decay volume housed in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank with a diameter of 1.92 m for the first 65 m , and 2.4 m for the rest .",
    "both beams follow the same path in the decay volume : their axes coincide to 1  mm , while their lateral sizes are about 1  cm . with @xmath49 protons per burst incident on the target , the positive ( negative ) beam flux at the entrance of the decay volume is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) particles per pulse ( primarily charged pions ) ,",
    "of which @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath47 flux ratio is about @xmath54 and stable to within 1% ; no correlations were observed between its variation in time and time - dependent inefficiencies of the setup .",
    "the fraction of beam kaons decaying in the decay volume at nominal momentum is @xmath55 .",
    "the decay volume is followed by a magnetic spectrometer  @xcite used to reconstruct tracks of charged particles .",
    "the spectrometer is housed in a tank filled with helium at nearly atmospheric pressure , separated from the vacuum tank by a thin ( @xmath56 ) kevlar composite window .",
    "a thin - walled aluminium beam pipe of 16 cm outer diameter traversing the centre of the spectrometer and all the following detectors allows the undecayed beam particles and the muon halo from decays of beam pions to continue their path in vacuum .",
    "the spectrometer consists of four identical drift chambers ( dch ) : dch1 , dch2 located upstream , and dch3 , dch4 downstream of a dipole magnet .",
    "the magnet has a field integral @xmath57  tm , providing a horizontal transverse momentum kick @xmath58 for charged particles .",
    "the dchs have the shape of a regular octagon with transverse size of about 2.8 m and fiducial area of about 4.5 m@xmath59 .",
    "each chamber is composed of eight planes of sense wires arranged in four pairs of staggered planes oriented horizontally , vertically , and along each of the two orthogonal @xmath60 directions .",
    "the spatial resolution of each dch is @xmath61 m .",
    "the nominal momentum resolution of the magnetic spectrometer is @xmath62 ( @xmath63 expressed in gev/@xmath46 ) .",
    "the measured resolution on the reconstructed @xmath64 invariant mass varied during the data taking time in the range of @xmath65  mev/@xmath66 in 2003 data , and @xmath67  mev/@xmath66 in 2004 , depending on dch performance ( generally , the chambers were operated at lower high voltage in 2004 ) .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer is followed by a plastic scintillator hodoscope ( hod ) used to produce fast trigger signals and to provide precise time measurements of charged particles .",
    "the hod , with a transverse size of about 2.4 m , consists of a plane of vertical and a plane of horizontal strip - shaped counters , each plane comprising 64 counters arranged in four quadrants .",
    "each quadrant is logically subdivided into 4 subquadrants ( `` segments '' ) which take part in the trigger logic .",
    "counter widths ( lengths ) vary from 6.5 cm ( 121 cm ) for central counters to 9.9 cm ( 60 cm ) for peripheral ones .",
    "the hod is followed by a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr )  @xcite used to detect electrons and photons .",
    "it is an almost homogeneous ionization chamber with an active volume of 7  m@xmath68 of liquid krypton , segmented transversally into 13248 projective cells , 2@xmath692 cm@xmath59 each , by a system of cu@xmath71be ribbon electrodes , and with no longitudinal segmentation .",
    "the calorimeter is @xmath72 deep and has an energy resolution @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is expressed in gev ) .",
    "the spatial resolution for a single electromagnetic shower is @xmath75 cm for the transverse coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "the lkr is followed by a hadronic calorimeter ( hac ) and a muon detector ( muv ) , both not used in the present analyses .",
    "a detailed description of the components of the na48 detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the event rate of @xmath76  khz is dominated by @xmath77 and @xmath78 decays , which are of limited physics interest as such within the na48/2 programme .",
    "a two - level trigger system is used to select the @xmath18 decay modes for readout , reducing the event rate to @xmath79  khz .    at the first level ( l1 )",
    ", the @xmath1 decays are triggered by requiring coincidences of hits in the two hod planes in at least two of the 16 segments ( the l1c condition ) .",
    "the @xmath2 decays are triggered by requiring a coincidence of the two hod planes in at least one segment , and the presence of at least two distinguishable clusters of energy deposition in the lkr ( the l1n condition ) . in some periods of data taking",
    "the l1n condition also used as input the total lkr energy deposition ( see section  [ sec : neutrig ] ) .",
    "the l1c signal is produced by the hod logic , while the l1n signal consists of hod and lkr components .",
    "these two components require separate analyses in order to study possible biases to the asymmetry measurement .",
    "the second level trigger ( l2 ) is based on a real time system computing coordinates of dch hits using dch drift times , and a farm of asynchronous microprocessors performing a fast reconstruction of tracks and running a decision - taking algorithm .",
    "the l2 algorithm selecting the @xmath2 events ( l2n ) examines the events passing the l1n condition , and requires the existence of a reconstructed track which , assumed to be a pion , has an energy @xmath80 mev in the rest frame of a @xmath81 having a momentum of 60 gev/@xmath46 directed along the @xmath43 axis .",
    "this condition suppresses the @xmath78 decays ( which have @xmath82 mev ) , while keeping the @xmath2 decays ( for which @xmath83 ranges between 140 mev and 193 mev ) .    the l2 algorithm selecting the @xmath1 events ( l2c ) examines the events passing the l1c condition , and requires at least two tracks to originate in the decay volume with the reconstructed distance of closest approach below 5 cm .",
    "l1c triggers not satisfying this condition are examined further and accepted if the l2n condition is satisfied .",
    "na48/2 collected data during two runs in 2003 and 2004 , with @xmath8450 days of efficient data taking in each run . about @xmath85 triggers , and 200 tb of data were recorded in total .",
    "charge symmetrization of the experimental conditions is to a large extent achieved by using simultaneous superimposed @xmath3 and @xmath4 beams with similar momentum spectra .",
    "however , the presence of magnetic fields in both the beam line ( achromats , focusing quadrupoles , etc . ) and the magnetic spectrometer , combined with some asymmetries in detector performance , introduces residual charge asymmetries . in order to equalize the local effects on the acceptance ,",
    "the polarities of all the magnets in the beam transport system were reversed during the data taking on an approximately weekly basis ( corresponding to the periodicity of sps technical stops ) , while the polarity of the spectrometer magnet was alternated on a more frequent basis ( approximately once per day in 2003 and once every 3 hours in 2004 ) .",
    "data collected over a period which has all four possible setup configurations ( i.e. combinations of beam line and spectrometer magnet polarities ) , spanning about two weeks of efficient data taking , represent a `` supersample '' and is treated as an independent and self - consistent set of data for the asymmetry measurement .    for the @xmath1 analysis ,",
    "nine supersamples numbered 0 to 8 were collected in two years of data taking ( supersamples 03 in 2003 and supersamples 48 in 2004 ) . for the @xmath2 analysis , a fraction of the data sample was rejected due to poor trigger performance , and another fraction of data was merged into a larger supersample to improve the balance of magnet polarities , which resulted in seven supersamples numbered i to vii ( supersamples i  iii in 2003 and supersamples iv  vii in 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath24-projection of the dalitz plot is sufficient to extract the information about @xmath35 at the desired level of precision .",
    "the measurement method is based on comparing the reconstructed @xmath24-spectra of @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays ( denoted as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively ) . in the framework of the parameterization ( [ slopes ] ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath88 is in good approximation proportional to @xmath89 the contribution of the @xmath90 term integrated over @xmath25 being negligible .",
    "the slope difference @xmath35 can be extracted from a fit to @xmath91 involving the measured slope parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite , and @xmath36 can be evaluated as in eq .",
    "( [ agdef ] ) .",
    "the parameters describing the dalitz plot distribution explicitly appear in the fitting function .",
    "this generates a certain dependence of the results on the assumed shape of the event density , which in our case is eq .",
    "( [ slopes ] ) .",
    "these effects will be discussed later .      it should be noted that any instrumental effect can induce a fake slope difference only if it is : ( 1 ) charge asymmetric and ( 2 ) correlated with @xmath24 .    for a given decay mode ,",
    "each supersample contains four sets of simultaneously collected @xmath92 and @xmath93 samples corresponding to the four different setup configurations ( eight data samples in total ) . to measure the charge asymmetry , exploiting the cancellations of systematic biases emerging due to polarity reversals ,",
    "the following `` quadruple ratio '' @xmath94 is evaluated .",
    "it involves the eight corresponding @xmath24 spectra , and is formed by the product of four @xmath88 ratios with opposite kaon sign and a deliberately chosen setup configuration in numerator and denominator : @xmath95 here the indices @xmath96/@xmath97 denote beam line polarities corresponding to @xmath3 passing along the upper / lower path in the achromats of the beamline , while the indices @xmath98/@xmath99 denote spectrometer magnet polarities ( opposite for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) corresponding to the `` even '' ( i.e. the two identical ) pions from a @xmath1 decay being deflected to negative / positive @xmath45 ( i.e. towards the salve / jura mountains ) .",
    "for example , @xmath100 is the ratio of the @xmath24 distribution for @xmath3 transported along the upper path in the beamline achromats and collected with a certain polarity of the spectrometer magnetic field , to the distribution for @xmath4 transported along the lower path and collected with the opposite analyzing magnet polarity .",
    "a fit of the quadruple ratio  ( [ quad ] ) with a function of the form @xmath101 results in the determination of two parameters : the normalization @xmath102 and the difference of slopes @xmath35 .",
    "the normalization is sensitive to the @xmath47 flux ratio , while @xmath35 is not .",
    "the rationale for choosing the four ratios @xmath91 appearing in  ( [ quad ] ) as the basic ones ( which is not the only possibility ) lies in the fact that they intrinsically cancel at first order instrumental effects linked to the imperfect left - right symmetry of the apparatus .",
    "as will be seen below , time variation of the left - right asymmetry ( which is primarily due to variations of spectrometer misalignment and beam geometry ) is the largest instrumental effect , and has been the primary subject of the analysis .",
    "the quadruple ratio technique logically completes the procedure of magnet polarity reversal , and allows a three - fold cancellation of systematic biases in the data , without the need to rely on an accurate simulation of the instrumental asymmetries :    * due to spectrometer magnet polarity reversal , local detector inefficiencies cancel between @xmath3 and @xmath4 samples with decay products reaching the same parts of the detector in each of the four ratios @xmath91 appearing in the quadruple ratio @xmath94 ; * due to the simultaneous beams , global time - variable biases cancel between @xmath3 and @xmath4 samples recorded at the same time in the product of @xmath103 and @xmath104 ratios ; * due to beam line polarity reversal , local beam line biases , resulting in slight differences in beam profiles and momentum spectra , largely cancel between the @xmath105 and @xmath106 ratios .",
    "the method is independent of the @xmath47 flux ratio and the relative sizes of the samples collected with different setup configurations .",
    "however , the statistical precision is limited mainly by the smallest of the samples involved , therefore the balance of sample sizes was controlled during the data taking .",
    "the result remains sensitive only to time variations of asymmetries in the experimental conditions which have a characteristic time smaller than the corresponding field alternation period .      in order to demonstrate that the level of cancellation of the systematic uncertainties achieved using the quadruple ratio technique is sufficient , the quantities cancelling in ( [ quad ] ) have to be measured .",
    "for this purpose , slopes of two other control quadruple ratios built out of the eight @xmath24 spectra are evaluated .",
    "these control ratios can be written as the products of the four ratios of the @xmath24 spectra for same sign kaons recorded with different setup configurations . as a result",
    ", any physical asymmetry cancels in these ratios , while the setup asymmetries do not .",
    "the fake slope difference @xmath107 introduced by global time - dependent detector variations does not cancel in a ratio with opposite spectrometer polarities and identical beam line polarities in numerator and denominator , or equivalently , in the adopted notation @xmath108 similarly , the fake slope difference @xmath109 introduced by the differences of the two beam paths does not cancel in a ratio with opposite beam line polarities and identical spectrometer polarities , namely : @xmath110 it should be noted that time stability of the beam line conditions is much better than the ( itself small ) difference between the upper and lower beam paths .",
    "the intrinsic left - right asymmetry of the experimental apparatus which , as already mentioned , cancels in each of the basic ratios appearing in  ( [ quad ] ) , can not be directly measured by the above two control ratios ( although it is accessible within an analysis based in different choice of the basic ratios ) .",
    "these asymmetric effects , being the largest of the residual effects and the central subject of investigation , have been taken into account with dedicated methods ( see sections  [ sec : alignment ] , [ sec : beam - geom ] ) .",
    "any possible systematic bias remaining in ( [ quad ] ) is of a higher order effect than @xmath107 and @xmath109 .",
    "thus , a measurement of fake slope differences compatible with zero , within their statistical uncertainties , validates the measurement method .      as described in section  [ sec : strategy ] , the data sample is divided into several independent self - contained supersamples .",
    "two methods of averaging the independent results over the supersamples were considered :    * averaging the measured quadruple ratios ( [ quad ] ) independently for each @xmath24 bin , and then fitting the resulting grand quadruple ratio with the function ( [ flin4 ] ) ; * independent fitting of the quadruple ratios in every supersample , and then averaging the results on @xmath35 .",
    "the first method allows the results to be presented in a compact form , i.e. in terms of a single spectrum for each of the two decay modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the second method allows a cross - check concerning several aspects of the analysis , in particular the time stability of the results .    as will be demonstrated below",
    ", the two methods lead to similar results due to the good balance of statistics which was maintained between the supersamples .      due to the method described above , no monte carlo ( mc ) corrections to the acceptance are required .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed geant - based  @xcite mc simulation was developed as a tool for the studies of possible systematic effects ; this includes full detector geometry and material description , stray magnetic fields simulation , local dch inefficiencies , dch misalignment , and the beam lines simulation ( which allows for a reproduction of kaon momentum spectra and beam profiles )",
    ". moreover , time variations of the above effects during the running period were simulated .",
    "a large - scale mc production was carried out for both @xmath18 decay modes , providing samples of sizes comparable to those of the data .",
    "namely , @xmath111 events were generated for each decay mode with the correct balance for each beam and detector configuration closely matching that of the data .",
    "reconstruction of @xmath112 events is based on the magnetic spectrometer information .",
    "tracks are reconstructed from hits in dchs using the measured magnetic field map rescaled to the recorded value of the electric current in the spectrometer analyzing magnet .",
    "systematic uncertainties arising from this procedure due to spectrometer misalignment and imperfect knowledge of magnetic fields are discussed in sections  [ sec : alignment ] and  [ sec : spectrometer_field ] , respectively .",
    "three - track vertices , compatible with the @xmath112 decay , are reconstructed using the kalman filter algorithm  @xcite by extrapolation of track segments from the upstream part of the spectrometer into the decay volume , taking into account multiple scattering in the kevlar window and helium volume , and the stray magnetic field in the decay volume due to the earth s field and parasitic magnetization of the vacuum tank .",
    "the stray field is non - uniform , and has a typical magnitude of 0.5  g ( comparable to the earth field ) ; the field map was measured in the entire vacuum tank before the 2003 run .",
    "its effect is to induce a transverse deviation of about 1  mm and an angular deviation of about @xmath37 rad to a 20 gev/@xmath46 charged particle traversing longitudinally the whole decay volume .",
    "accounting for the stray field in the vertex reconstruction reduces the amplitude of the measured sinusoidal variation of the reconstructed @xmath64 invariant mass with respect to the azimuthal orientation of the odd pion by more than an order of magnitude , to a level below 0.05 mev/@xmath66 .",
    "the event kinematics is calculated using the reconstructed track momenta and directions as extrapolated to the decay vertex .",
    "several stages of compaction and filtering of the data were applied , reducing the data volume from @xmath113 tb to @xmath114 tb , while reducing the number of events in the sample from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "the applied filtering algorithm includes rejection of low quality data and also soft kinematic constraints : the main requirement is the presence of at least 3 reconstructed tracks in the event , which rejects about @xmath117 of the recorded triggers .",
    "the principal selection criteria applied to the reconstructed variables are listed below . note that corrections to track momenta for spectrometer misalignment and magnetic field , discussed in the following sections  [ sec : alignment ] and  [ sec : spectrometer_field ] , are applied before the kinematics of the event is reconstructed and the selection is made .    *",

    "the measurement of pion momenta is based on the knowledge of the magnetic field in the spectrometer magnet .",
    "the variation of the current in the magnet biases the overall momentum scale of the spectrometer .",
    "this variation can be directly measured with a relative precision of @xmath140 ; smaller variations are continuously monitored with a precision of @xmath141 using the deviation of the reconstructed charge - averaged kaon mass from the nominal pdg value  @xcite . a time - dependent correction can be introduced by scaling the reconstructed track momenta symmetrically for positive and negative tracks . however , the momentum scale effects are a priori highly charge - symmetric by design , due to the simultaneous @xmath3 and @xmath4 beams ( this was also explicitly verified by comparing the results obtained with and without the correction ) . therefore no correction was applied for spectrometer current .    on the contrary ,",
    "the effects caused by a non - uniform permanent ( not inverting with the spectrometer magnetic field polarity ) component of the magnetic field in the region of the spectrometer magnet are potentially charge asymmetric .",
    "they were studied by artificially introducing the corresponding distortions to measured track momenta depending on the coordinates of impact points in the magnetic plane , consistent with the measurement precision of the magnetic field map and the expected size of the permanent field ( @xmath142  g ) .",
    "the resulting variation of the result of @xmath143 was considered as a residual systematic uncertainty due to this effect .",
    "remarkably , a statistically significant @xmath144 measured with the events from the side bands of @xmath64 mass distribution ( i.e. outside the signal region ) can be achieved by introducing certain realistic configurations of a non - uniform permanent magnetic field in the region of the spectrometer magnet .",
    "the geometric acceptance for the @xmath1 decays is mainly determined by the vacuum beam pipe traversing the centres of the dchs , and the material in the central region of each dch where certain groups of dch wires terminate - value of the @xmath112 decay , @xmath145 mev , the outer edges of the dchs do not bias the acceptance . ] .",
    "moreover , the beam optics can only control the average transverse beam positions to @xmath146  mm .",
    "time variations of the transverse beam positions within the mentioned precision generate a sizable charge - asymmetric bias to the acceptance inducing instrumental slope asymmetries of the order of a few units of @xmath39 .",
    "it would require a stability of the transverse beam positions to the level of @xmath147 m in order to reduce the bias to a negligible level .",
    "however it is possible to determine the average @xmath3 and @xmath4 beam positions as functions of time to this order of precision and apply charge symmetric cuts , as explained below .",
    "inner dch geometrical acceptance cuts which fully contain the beam pipe and the surrounding dch regions are applied to the positions of pion impact points @xmath148 in the planes of dch1 and dch4 relative to the average beam intercepts in the dch planes .",
    "these vary slightly with time and differ for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the transverse coordinates of a beam kaon @xmath149 in the planes of dch1 and dch2 for each event are reconstructed as the momentum - weighted averages of the coordinates @xmath150 of the three reconstructed pions : @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is reconstructed momentum of a pion .",
    "transverse coordinates of a beam kaon in the plane of dch4 @xmath153 corresponding to absence of the bending by the analyzing magnet are computed by linear extrapolation using @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the average beam positions in the planes of dch1 and dch4 @xmath156 are computed on the basis of the distributions of @xmath154 and @xmath157 for the selected event sample . a bias introduced to @xmath158 by the fact that @xmath159 and @xmath152",
    "are themselves affected by the acceptance is negligible .",
    "a database of the average beam positions @xmath158 depending on kaon sign , time ( excursions of @xmath142 mm ) , kaon momentum ( excursions of @xmath142 mm in the horizontal plane , @xmath142 cm in the vertical plane ) , and time within sps spill ( excursions of @xmath142 mm ) was created .",
    "the conditions @xmath160  cm , @xmath125 , are applied to symmetrize the beam geometry effects .",
    "these cuts cost @xmath161 of the statistics , leading to a sample of @xmath162 events .",
    "the minimum distance of 11.5 cm is chosen to ensure that the region of the beam pipe and the adjacent central insensitive areas of the dchs are securely excluded by the cut .",
    "the residual systematic effects arise from the stray magnetic field in the decay volume , which deflects @xmath148 with respect to @xmath156 in a charge - antisymmetric way .",
    "corrections for the stray field to the measured @xmath163 were performed . however , the precision of these corrections is limited by the precision of magnetic field measurement , which leads to a residual systematic uncertainty of @xmath164 .",
    "only charge - asymmetric trigger inefficiencies correlated with @xmath24 can possibly bias the measurement .",
    "inefficiencies of the individual trigger components were directly measured as functions of @xmath24 using control data samples from prescaled low bias triggers collected along with the main ones .",
    "this allowed for an accounting for time variations of the efficiencies , and for a propagation of the statistical errors of the measured inefficiencies into the final result .",
    "the trigger logic is described in section  [ sec : triggers ] .",
    "the control trigger condition for the l1 efficiency measurement requires at least one coincidence of hits in the two planes of the hod .",
    "the control triggers for the l2 efficiency measurement are l1 triggers recorded regardless of the l2 response .",
    "the statistics of each of the two control samples is roughly 1% of the main sample .",
    "the l1 trigger condition requires the coincidence of hits in two of the 16 non - overlapping hod segments .",
    "this condition is loose as there are three charged particles in a fully reconstructed event , and the resulting inefficiency is low .",
    "it was measured to be @xmath165 and found to be stable in time . due to a few short - term malfunctions of a hod channel , several subsamples of the data sample",
    "are affected by higher inefficiency ( up to @xmath166 ) , the source of the inefficiency being localized in space .",
    "this kind of inefficiency was reduced ( and symmetrized ) in the selected data sample by applying appropriate geometric cuts to the pion impact points on the hodoscope surface for the relevant supersamples .",
    "this procedure led to the loss of 7.1% of the statistics , reducing the final sample to @xmath6 events .",
    "due to good time stability of the l1 inefficiency , no bias from the l1 trigger is assumed .",
    "an overall uncertainty of the l1 bias was conservatively estimated to @xmath167 , limited by the statistics of the control sample .",
    "two components of the l2 trigger inefficiency were identified : one due to trigger timing misalignment , and the other due to local dch inefficiency ( so called `` geometrical '' ) .",
    "the part related to timing misalignment has a size of @xmath168 , and a priori does not affect the result , being uncorrelated to the kinematic variables .",
    "its charge symmetry was checked with a detailed mc simulation of pile - up effects , and a study of the dependence of the result on the number of allowed accidental tracks . on the contrary",
    ", the geometrical part is correlated to event kinematics , and varies in time due to variations of the local dch inefficiencies .",
    "these inefficiencies affect the trigger more than the offline reconstruction due to lower redundancy and worse online resolutions .",
    "for this reason the measured @xmath24 spectra are corrected for this part of the inefficiency .",
    "the size of the inefficiency for the selected sample was measured to be close to @xmath169 , but some periods are affected by higher inefficiency of up to 1.5% ( its sources not being localized in space in a simple way ) . the correction to the whole statistics amounts to @xmath170 , where the error is statistical owing to the limited size of the control sample .",
    "the above procedure leads to over - estimation of the systematic uncertainties related to trigger inefficiencies , since the correlations of trigger inefficiencies in bins of @xmath24 ( in other words , smoothness of variation of trigger efficiency over @xmath24 ) are not taken into account .      the reconstructed dalitz plot distribution of the events passing the selection and the corrections described in the previous sections ( corresponding to a fraction of the sample ) is presented in fig .",
