    "the field of optical coherent transients @xcite had at its origin the pioneering work of kurnit , abella , and hartmann on photon echoes @xcite . since that work , hartmann and coworkers have made a large number of significant contributions in both cw and transient nonlinear spectroscopy .",
    "one of us ( prb ) had the good fortune to collaborate with his group on problems related to diffractive scattering of atoms in superposition states @xcite .",
    "there were also a number of spirited discussions on the billiard ball model of photon echoes @xcite , a model which was somewhat before its time since it is now used commonly in theoretical models of atom interferometers @xcite .",
    "it is with great pleasure that we participate in this _ festschrift _ volume to honor sven hartmann .    the first wave of experiments on optical coherent transients , such as photon echoes and free precession @xcite , involved coherence between different electronic states that are coupled by an optical field .",
    "subsequent experiments , however , such as the _ stimulated photon echo _ @xcite _ , _ employed optical fields as a means for creating coherence between ground state sublevels ( or a spatial modulation of a single ground state population ) . since ground state coherences can have decoherence times approaching seconds , rather than the tens or hundreds of nanoseconds associated with optical transitions , ground state coherence has important applications in atom interferometry and quantum information .",
    "there is now an extensive literature on both _",
    "cw _ and coherent transient , ground state spectroscopy .    in recent years , both _ cw _ and pulsed optical fields have been used to control the center - of - mass motion of atoms .",
    "of particular interest to the current discussion is the possibility of using optical fields having wavelength @xmath2 to create _ high - order matter wave gratings _ having period @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a positive integer greater than or equal to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "such matter wave gratings could serve as efficient scatters of soft x - rays .",
    "there have been several schemes proposed for achieving this goal , but most of these schemes involve several atom - field interaction zones .",
    "recently we showed that it is possible to create high - order gratings in a _",
    "interaction zone using a set of counterpropagating optical fields having different frequencies @xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of that work was set by the lifetime of the excited state of the transition .",
    "the product of atom - field detunings and excited state lifetime has to be much greater than unity to satisfy certain adiabaticity requirements , and this necessitates the use of large detunings that leads to a corresponding decrease in transition amplitudes .",
    "these problems can be avoided if one replaces the optical transitions with ground - state , raman transitions .",
    "a pair of fields drives transitions from one ground state sublevel to another and acts as an effective two - photon field that is the analogue of the single field that drives an optical transition . in analogue with the optical case",
    ", the two - photon field leads to a spatially modulated raman coherence , but _ not _ to a spatially modulated population of the ground state sublevels@xcite . however , a _ pair _ of such two - photon fields , acting as a _",
    "raman standing wave field _ , leads to ground state gratings having period @xmath10 . with a proper choice of field polarization and initial conditions ,",
    "the population density in these systems can have period @xmath1 , even if the overall period of the matter wave gratings ( including the dependence on internal states ) has periodicity @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , a field geometry involving three pairs of fields can be used to produce gratings having period @xmath11 , where @xmath8 is a positive integer greater than 2 .",
    "we first describe the method for producing @xmath0 periodicity and then discuss briefly how to extend this method to produce higher - order gratings . the possibility of creating optical lattices having period @xmath11 using these techniques is explored .",
