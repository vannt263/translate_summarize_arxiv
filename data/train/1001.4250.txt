    "nanoscopic physics has been a subject of increasing experimental and theoretical interest for its potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems)@xcite . the physical properties of these devices are of crucial importance in improving our understanding of the fundamental science in this area including many - body phenomena@xcite . one of the most striking paradigms exhibiting many body effects in mesoscopic science is quantum transport through single electronic levels in quantum dots and single molecules@xcite coupled to external leads .",
    "realizations of these systems have been obtained using semiconductor beams coupled to single electron transistors ( set s ) and superconducting single electron transistors ( ssets)@xcite , carbon nanotubes@xcite and , most recently , suspended graphene sheets@xcite .",
    "such systems can be used as a direct measure of small displacements , forces and mass in the quantum regime .",
    "the quantum transport properties of these systems require extremely sensitive measurement that can be achieved by using set s , or a resonant tunnel junction , and sset s . in this context , nems are not only interesting devices studied for ultrasensitive transducers but also because they are expected to exhibit several exclusive features of transport phenomena such as avalanche - like transport and shuttling instability@xcite .",
    "the nanomechanical properties of a resonant tunnel junction coupled to an oscillator@xcite or a set@xcite coupled to an oscillator are currently playing a vital role in enhancing the understanding of nems .",
    "the nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a resonant tunnel junction or set is a close analogue of a molecule being used as a sensor whose sensitivity has reached the quantum limit@xcite . the signature of quantum states has been predicted for the nanomechanical oscillator coupled to the sets@xcite and ssets@xcite . in these experiments , it has been confirmed that the nanomechanical oscillator is strongly affected by the electron transport in the circumstances where we are also trying to explore the quantum regime of nems . in this system ,",
    "electrons tunnel from one of the leads to the isolated conductor and then to the other lead .",
    "phonon assisted tunneling of non  resonant systems has mostly been shown by experiments on inelastic tunneling spectroscopy ( its ) . with the advancement of modern technology , as compared to its , scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) have proved more valuable tools for the investigation and characterization of molecular systems@xcite in the conduction regime . in sts  experiments , significant signatures of the strong electron - phonon interaction have been observed@xcite beyond the established perturbation theory .",
    "hence , a theory beyond master equation approach or linear response is necessary .",
    "most of the theoretical work on transport in nems has been done within the scattering theory approach ( landauer ) but it disregards the contacts and their effects on the scattering channel as well as effect of electrons and phonons on each other@xcite . very recently , the non  equilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach@xcite has been growing in importance in the quantum transport of nanomechanical systems@xcite .",
    "an advantage of this method is that it treats the infinitely extended reservoirs in an exact way@xcite , which may lead to a better understanding of the essential features of nems .",
    "negf has been applied in the study of shot noise in chain models@xcite and disordered junctions@xcite while noise in coulomb blockade josephson junctions has been discussed within a phase correlation theory approach@xcite . in the case of an inelastic resonant tunneling structure , in which strong electron - phonon coupling is often considered",
    ", a very strong source - drain voltage is expected for which coherent electron transport in molecular devices has been considered by some workers@xcite within the scattering theory approach .",
    "inelastic effects on the transport properties have been studied in connection with nems and substantial work on this issue has been done , again within the scattering theory approach@xcite .",
    "recently , phonon assisted resonant tunneling conductance has been discussed within the negf technique at zero temperature@xcite . to the best of our knowledge , in all these studies",
    ", time - dependent quantum transport properties of a resonant tunnel junction coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator have not been discussed so far .",
    "the development of time - dependent quantum transport for the treatment of nonequilibrium system with phononic as well as fermionic degree of freedom has remained a challenge since the 1980s@xcite .",
    "generally , time - dependent transport properties of mesoscopic systems without nanomechanical oscillator have been reported@xcite and , in particular , sudden joining of the leads with quantum dot molecule have been investigated@xcite for the case of a noninteracting quantum dot and for a weakly coulomb interacting molecular system .",
    "strongly interacting systems in the kondo regime have been investigated@xcite .",
    "more recently@xcite , the transient effects occurring in a molecular quantum dot described by an anderson - holstein hamiltonian has been discussed . to this end , we present the following study .    in the present work , we shall investigate the time evolution of a quantum dot coupled to a single vibrational mode as a reaction to a sudden joining to the leads .",
    "we employ the non - equilibrium green s function method in order to discuss the transient and steady state dynamics of nems .",
    "this is a fully quantum mechanical formulation whose basic approximations are very transparent , as the technique has already been used to study transport properties in a wide range of systems . in our calculation",
    "inclusion of the oscillator is not perturbative as the sts experiments@xcite are beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "so a non - perturbative approach is required beyond the quantum master equation@xcite or linear response .",
    "hence , our work provides an exact analytical solution to the current  voltage characteristics , including coupling of leads with the system , very small chemical potential difference and both the right and left fermi level response regimes .",
    "for simplicity , we use the wide - band approximation@xcite , where the density of states in the leads and hence the coupling between the leads and the dot is taken to be independent of energy . although the method we are using does not rely on this approximation .",
    "this provides a way to perform transient transport calculations from first principles while retaining the essential physics of the electronic structure of the dot and the leads .",
    "another advantage of this method is that it treats the infinitely extended reservoirs in an exact way in the present system , which may give a better understanding of the essential features of nems in a more appropriate quantum mechanical picture .",
    "we consider a single quantum dot connected to two identical metallic leads . a single oscillator is coupled to the electrons on the dot and the applied gate voltage",
    "is used to tune the single level of the dot . in the present system ,",
    "we neglect the spin degree of freedom and electron - electron interaction effects and consider the simplest possible model system .",
    "we also neglect the effects of finite electron temperature of the lead reservoirs and damping of the oscillator .",
    "our model consists of the individual entities such as the single quantum dot and the left and right leads in their ground states at zero temperature .",

[ fig.6 ] for fixed values of tunneling @xmath132 , @xmath131 and for different values of coupling strength @xmath140 @xmath129 .",
    "we found damped oscillations for short times and constant energy for long times .",
    "this constant average energy increases with increasing fermi level . why have we found this particular type of structure ?",
    "we know that the nanomechanical oscillator potential seen by the electrons on the dot is independent of time when the oscillator is in any of its pure eigenstates . otherwise , when the oscillator is not in a pure state , the potential seen by the electrons is time dependent . in the former case ,",
    "the electrons are scattered elastically by the time independent potential and in the latter case the scattering process is inelastic because the time dependent potential allow the transfer of energy between the two .",
    "we observe that the constant average energy also has steps as a function of the left fermi level which become more pronounced with increasing coupling strength .",
    "hence , the oscillatory part of the behavior of the mechanical oscillator is damped by coupling with the electrons on the dot but the constant part is not .",
    "the damping mechanism in the transient dynamics is due to transfer of energy from the nanomechanical oscillator to the electrons on the dot while when the oscillator is in any of the pure eigenstate then there is no mechanism for the transfer of energy between the two .",
    "this same physical phenomenon also applies to the net current flowing through the dot as well .",
    "this appear to be a specifically new quantum phenomena in the study of nanomechanical systems .",
    "average energy transferred to the oscillator as a function of @xmath141 and for fixed values of @xmath142 and @xmath122 .",
    "units : all the parameters have same dimension as of @xmath109.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    can we compare this quantum phenomena with the classical mechanical oscillator ?",
    "yes , the nanomechanical oscillator has to enter the classical regime in the limit of small @xmath143 . for this , we study the dynamics of the quantum oscillator in the classical limit , in which @xmath143 in the mechanical oscillator part of the hamiltonian given in eq .",

    "we found that the average energy of the quantum nanomechanical oscillator scales as @xmath149 .",
    "we set the average energy in the limit @xmath150 to see what happen to the system for long time .",
    "it implies that in this limit , the energy transferred to the nanomechanical oscillator is zero for long time .",
    "hence , we conclude that the long time dynamics of the classical mechanical oscillator is always zero .",

    "the nanomechanical oscillator shows thermal like behavior and poissonian statistics while in the limit of strong coupling its dynamics is non - thermal which leads to super - poissonian statistics . in this figure ,",
    "the short time behavior is always thermal , but this is trivial as the nanomechanical oscillator is initially in its ground state .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have found mixed and pure states in our results which confirm the quantum dynamics of our model with the following justifications : in a classical mechanical oscillator model@xcite all states give rise to a time dependent potential .",
    "hence , all states of the classical mechanical oscillator are damped .",
    "thus , we confirm the new quantum dynamics of the nanomechanical oscillator that will be helpful for further experiments beyond the classical limit to develop better understanding of nems devices .",
    "in this work , we analyzed the time - dependent quantum transport of a resonant tunnel junction coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator by using the nonequilibrium green s function approach without treating the electron phonon coupling as a perturbation .",
    "we have derived an expression for the full density matrix or the dot population and discuss it in detail for different values of the coupling strength and the tunneling rate .",
    "we derive an expression for the current to see the effects of the coupling of the electrons to the oscillator on the dot and the tunneling rate of electrons to resolve the dynamics of the nanomechanical oscillator .",
    "this confirms that electrons resolve the dynamics of nanomechanical oscillator in the regime @xmath154 while they do not in the opposite case @xmath155 furthermore , we discuss the average energy transferred to oscillator as a function of time .",
    "we also discuss the fano factor as a function of time , which shows thermal behavior and poissonian to non - thermal and super - poissonian behavior . we have found new dynamics of the nanomechanical oscillator : pure and mixed states , which are never present in a classical oscillator .",
