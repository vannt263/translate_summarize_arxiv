    "in the study of quantum information theory it is often assumed that classical information is effectively noiseless , free and unlimited . in this context",
    "many problems become trivial . for example , consider a situation in which alice wants to ` teleport ' @xcite a quantum state , whose identity is known to her , to bob ( this has come to be known as ` remote state preparation ' @xcite ) . if classical information is considered to be free , then no teleportation - type procedure is actually needed .",
    "alice can simply call bob on the telephone and tell him what the state is .",
    "if they do nt care how long the call lasts then bob can construct a state arbitrarily close to alice s original .",
    "remote state preparation becomes non - trivial if we wish to restrict the amount of classical information that alice can send to bob .",
    "of course , if alice and bob share a perfect singlet ( or one ebit ) , then they can achieve perfect teleportation with the transmission of only two classical bits ( cbits ) .",
    "but in @xcite , it is shown that if alice and bob do nt mind using up a large amount of entanglement , then in the asymptotic limit as the number of states being teleported tends to infinity , they can get away with sending only one cbit per qubit and still retain arbitrarily good fidelity .",
    "` large amount ' of entanglement means that the amount needed increases exponentially with the number of qubits being sent .",
    "it is also shown that this exponential increase becomes a mere multiplying factor if we allow cbits to be sent from bob to alice .",
    "further , an upper bound is plotted for how many cbits must be sent if we wish to use less than one ebit per qubit transmitted . in @xcite , an optimal procedure is given for this less - than - one - ebit case .",
    "other issues will arise if we consider all quantum channels to be noisy and thus prevent the sharing of perfect singlets .",
    "we might consider , in the context of some given situation , how the transmission of extra cbits can offset this problem .",
    "of course , if imperfect singlets are shared then one option is always to try to distill better singlets @xcite .",
    "but note that ( i ) in general it is not possible to distill a perfect singlet from a finite number of mixed states , so the resulting states are still noisy @xcite , ( ii ) some states only admit distillation if collective operations are allowed , that is operations on more than one pair at once , ( for example this is true of werner states @xcite ) and this may be impractical in a given situation and most importantly ( iii ) distillation itself involves the sending of cbits and if this is expensive , distillation may not be the best option",
    ".    it may rarely be the case that the sending of ( relatively noiseless ) cbits is expensive compared with the sending of ( potentially noisy ) qubits .",
    "even if so , by assuming always that classical information is effectively free and thereby not bothering to count it , we may miss out on interesting theoretical relations between quantum and classical information .",
    "with the above in mind , we consider the following problem .",
    "alice and bob are separated by a noisy quantum channel .",
    "alice sends into the channel some quantum state , drawn from an ensemble @xmath0 ( where the state @xmath1 is drawn with probability @xmath2 and alice and bob both know the ensemble ) .",
    "alice is given a classical description of which state went into the channel and can also send @xmath3 noiseless classical bits which encode part of this information .",
    "bob then performs some operation on the state which he receives in an effort to undo the effects of the noise .",
    "if bob s eventual state , given that @xmath1 was sent , is @xmath4 , then the average fidelity is given by @xmath5 .",
    "we wish to describe a scheme for alice and bob which will optimize this quantity .",
    "we note that one might consider an alternative scenario in which alice is trying to prepare states remotely and can generate any state she wants to be sent into the channel .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that alice may , in this alternative case , generate and send a state which is different from the one which she wants bob ultimately to end up with .",
    "here we do not investigate this possibility but concentrate only on the scenario in which the state entering the channel is always identical with the state alice wishes bob to prepare .",
    "this would be the case if alice has no control over what goes into the channel but is simply given a classical description . or",
    "if alice sends the state she wants bob to have into the channel expecting it to be noiseless and only finds out about the noise later , at which point she decides to send some additional classical information .",
    "we start by describing how the most general possible scheme will work .",
    "it is well known that the most general evolution which a quantum state can undergo ( assuming that if measurements are performed , their results are to be averaged over ) corresponds to a completely positive trace - preserving map @xcite . in the kraus representation , this can be written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the identity .",
    "we refer to such a map as a quantum operation .",
    "both the noise experienced by the state as it passes down the channel and bob s operation take this form .",
    "now consider that the experiment described above is repeated many times - each time , alice sends a quantum state down the noisy channel , and @xmath3 classical bits , and bob performs some quantum operation .",
    "focus attention on those runs of the experiment in which the classical bit - string has a certain value , say @xmath9 .",
    "we may as well regard bob as performing the same quantum operation on each of these runs .",
    "we use the fact that a probabilistic mixture of quantum operations is itself a quantum operation .",
    "so we can stipulate without loss of generality that which quantum operation bob applies depends deterministically on the values of the @xmath3 cbits .",
    "we can also stipulate without loss of generality that the values of the @xmath3 cbits sent by alice depend deterministically on which quantum state she is sending .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that a particular quantum state determines only probabilistically the values of the cbits .",
    "then , instead of regarding alice and bob as using a probabilistic scheme , one might regard them as using one from several deterministic schemes , with certain probabilities .",
    "but then the average fidelity obtained will be the average over that obtained for each of the deterministic schemes and we would do better simply to use whichever of these is the best .",
    "it follows from the above that we lose no generality if we restrict ourselves to schemes which work as follows .",
    "the ensemble is divided up into @xmath10 sub - ensembles .",
    "alice uses the @xmath3 classical bits to tell bob which sub - ensemble the state she is sending lies in .",
    "bob has a choice of @xmath10 possible quantum operations to perform . which one he performs is determined by the values of the @xmath3 classical bits .",
    "the problem is to find the scheme which leads to the maximum value for @xmath11 .",
    "we can split this problem into two .",
    "the first part is to determine , for a general ensemble of quantum states , @xmath12 which undergo some noise process of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a quantum operation : what is the best operation to perform in order to undo this noise as well as possible ?",
    "in other words , we wish to find an operation @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is maximized .",
    "the second part is to determine the best way for alice to divide the initial ensemble into @xmath10 sub - ensembles , given that an answer to the first part will determine for bob an operation to perform on each sub - ensemble .",
    "unfortunately , even the first of these appears to be a difficult problem in itself .",
    "some progress is made by barnum and knill in @xcite , but they are concerned with maximizing entanglement fidelity and their results are only valid for ensembles of commuting density operators and so are not immediately useful for our problem .    for the rest of this paper , we are less ambitious .",
    "we consider only a very simple instance of the problem in which alice sends just one cbit and the pure states she sends are qubit states drawn from a distribution which is uniform over the bloch sphere .",
    "the noisy quantum channel is a depolarizing channel , which acts as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "we will see that the solution even to this seemingly trivial problem involves a surprising amount of structure - suggesting that relationships between classical and quantum information in general may well be very intricate .",
    "consider the scenario in which alice sends to bob a pure state drawn from a uniform distribution over the bloch sphere , which gets depolarized on the way , and a single noiseless classical bit . from the above ,",
    "we know that alice must divide the surface of the bloch sphere into two subsets , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which correspond to the cbit taking the value ` 0 ' or ` 1 ' .",
    "we must then find , in each case , the optimal quantum operation for bob to perform , given that the depolarized qubit lies in that particular subset .",
    "we begin by assuming that alice divides up the bloch sphere in the following fashion :    [ assumption ] for a general state , @xmath21 , we have that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is some fixed basis state corresponding to the point @xmath24 , or the north pole , on the bloch sphere and @xmath25 .",
    "otherwise @xmath26 .",
    "we conjecture that this assumption leads to an optimal scheme ( it seems very likely , for example , that in the optimal scheme the sets @xmath19 and @xmath20 will be simply connected and unlikely that the optimal scheme will be less symmetric than the one presented ) . in the rest of this section",
    ", we derive the optimal quantum operations for bob to perform , in the cases that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is helpful to write quantum operations in a different way .",
    "suppose that a general qubit density matrix is written @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a real 3-vector and @xmath31 .",
    "then , from the fact that a quantum operation is linear , we can write it in the form @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a real @xmath34 matrix and @xmath35 is a real 3-vector .",
    "we have also automatically included the conditions that a quantum operation must be trace - preserving and positive .",
    "the condition of complete positivity imposes further constraints on @xmath33 and @xmath35 . of course we must also have that @xmath36",
    "further , we can write @xmath33 in the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is orthogonal ( i.e. a rotation ) and @xmath39 is symmetric .",
    "so we can view a quantum operation as a deformation of the bloch sphere along principal axes determined by s , followed by a rotation , followed by a translation .",
    "suppose now that @xmath40 .",
    "bob performs an operation characterized by @xmath33 and @xmath35 . from the symmetry of the problem",
    ", it follows that the fidelity obtained ( averaged over all @xmath21 such that @xmath40 ) is unchanged if bob performs a different operation , characterized by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 and where @xmath45 is a rotation of angle @xmath46 about the z - axis .",
    "it follows from this that the fidelity is also unchanged if bob performs an operation characterized by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where : @xmath49 and @xmath50 this means that without loss of generality , we can restrict bob to actions of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a fixed rotation about the z - axis . from the condition that @xmath55 , we get @xmath56 .",
    "quantum operations are contractions on the bloch sphere .",
    "recall that the qubit which bob receives has been depolarized .",
    "we can write its density matrix in the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "ideally , bob would like an operation which takes @xmath59 , at least for those states belonging to @xmath19 , but this is not allowed ( such an operation is not a contraction ) .",
    "bob s operation will in fact consist of a translation in the z - direction and contractions parametrized by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is clear geometrically that in the optimum scheme , @xmath62 , where @xmath8 is the identity .",
    "our aim is now , for fixed @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath9 , to find the optimum values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , consistently with their describing a genuine quantum operation ( which , recall , must correspond to a completely positive map on the set of density matrices ) .",
    "in fact , one can show that complete positivity implies that : @xmath65 and @xmath66 these conditions are necessary but not sufficient .",
    "the actual derivation of these conditions is unenlightening , so we do not reproduce it here .",
    "it is easy to see now that bob s best operation will be characterized by setting @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this gives :    @xmath69    and @xmath70 in fact , remarkably , this corresponds to an already well known quantum operation , usually described as an ` amplitude damping channel ' .",
    "amplitude damping is usually studied for its physical relevance - it corresponds to many natural physical processes .",
    "for example , it may describe an atom coupled to a single mode of electromagnetic radiation undergoing spontaneous emission , or a single photon mode from which a photon may be scattered by a beam splitter @xcite .",
    "this suggests that our scheme should be easily implementable experimentally .",
    "one can run through similar arguments for the case @xmath71 .",
    "again , it turns out that bob s optimal operation is essentially an amplitude damping operation , except that in this case , the vector @xmath35 will point in the opposite direction i.e. bob s operation will involve a translation of the bloch sphere downwards , towards the south pole , as well as some contraction . for the rest of this paper we calculate the optimum fidelity that bob can achieve for a given @xmath63 . for fixed @xmath64",
    ", one can optimize over the value of @xmath9 separately for the cases @xmath40 and @xmath72 ( the optimum value of @xmath9 may sometimes be zero implying that bob s best operation is to do nothing ) .",
    "one can then optimize over @xmath64 .",
    "after the action of the depolarizing channel and bob s quantum operation , we have that : @xmath73 the average fidelity is given by : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is bob s quantum operation parameter in the case that @xmath72 and is defined so that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "optimizing over @xmath9 , @xmath75 and @xmath64 numerically leads to the graph shown in figure [ fidelitygraph ] which shows the achievable fidelity for a depolarizing channel parametrized by @xmath63 . also shown on the graph",
    "is the fidelity obtained in the case that alice sends no cbit and bob performs no quantum operation .",
    "we finish this section by noting some features of the graph .    1 .",
    "as we might expect , our scheme always yields an advantage when compared with doing nothing .",
    "2 .   if alice can send to bob one cbit but can not use a quantum channel , then the best obtainable fidelity is @xmath78 ( alice tells bob ` upper ' or ` lower ' hemisphere and bob prepares a state which is spin up or spin down accordingly ) . with our scheme",
    "we have @xmath79 if @xmath80 .",
    "thus the quantum channel is some use for any @xmath81 .",
    "3 .   there is a kink in the graph at @xmath82 .",
    "further numerical investigations reveal why this is the case .",
    "denote the optimum value of @xmath64 ( the angle which describes how alice is dividing up the bloch sphere ) by @xmath83 .",
    "below this value of @xmath63 , we have @xmath84 . at @xmath85 ,",
    "@xmath83 suddenly jumps to @xmath86 and then decreases as @xmath63 increases .",
    "this is shown in figure [ anglegraph ] .",
    "4 .   in the @xmath87 region ,",
    "where @xmath84 , we can calculate @xmath11 analytically yielding @xmath88 .",
    "5 .   as @xmath89",
    ", bob s operation tends towards a simple ` swap ' operation which maps all points in the bloch sphere to one of the poles depending on which hemisphere the qubit lies in .",
    "if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 and alice and bob , if they can , would do better to use a protocol due to gisin in which alice sends two noiseless cbits and no quantum information @xcite .",
    "we have considered situations in which alice and bob wish to use noiseless classical information to offset quantum noise - a kind of error correction .",
    "an important feature is that alice possesses a classical description of the quantum states she wishes to send . after considering these situations in generality",
    ", we turned to consider a very specific scenario in which alice sends one qubit which passes through a depolarizing channel accompanied by a noiseless classical bit .",
    "we described a scheme which we conjecture is optimal which involves alice dividing up the bloch sphere as in assumption [ assumption ] above and bob performing ` amplitude damping ' operations .",
    "our results for this scheme were obtained by brute force .",
    "clearly a more principled approach is desirable .",
    "one idea might be to regard the depolarization as actually coming about through the actions of an eavesdropper , eve .",
    "eve gains some information about the quantum state passing through and must therefore gain some information about its identity .",
    "it follows that even after bob s recovery operation , some disturbance to the state is inevitable @xcite .",
    "this way , one might be able to derive an upper bound on bob s achievable fidelity for more general scenarios than the one considered here .",
