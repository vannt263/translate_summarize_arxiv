    "the aim of this paper is to construct limit objects for convergent sequences of finite mappings @xmath0 ( `` finite '' meaning that @xmath1 is finite ) and , conversely , to approximate a limit object by a finite mapping .",
    "this work originated within the scope of the recent studies of graph limits @xcite , and more precisely within the framework of structural limits @xcite .    in order to make the motivation of this paper clear ,",
    "we take time for a quick review of some of the fundamental notions and problems encountered in the domain of graph limits , and how they are related to the study of limits and approximations of algebras ( that is of functional structures ) .",
    "the notion of _ left convergence _ of lovsz and szegedy @xcite is strongly related to important tools of extremal graph ( and hypergraph ) theory , like szemerdi regularity lemma and its extensions , or razborov s flag algebra @xcite .",
    "it is also strongly related to probability theory , and in particular to generalizations of de finetti s theorem by hoover @xcite and aldous @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this",
    "setting , a convergent sequence of graphs admit as a limit a simple object , called _ graphon _ , which is a measurable function @xmath2\\times[0,1]\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] ( defined up to measure preserving transformations ) . for @xmath3-regular hypergraphs , the limit object , called _ hypergraphon _",
    "@xcite is a bit more complex ( it is a measurable function from @xmath4^{2^k-2}$ ] to @xmath4 $ ] ) .",
    "although this last case gives some hints on what left limits of relational structures could be , it leaves open the case of structures with functional symbols . in the graph ( or hypergraph ) setting , a sequence is left - convergent if the probability that @xmath3 random elements induce a specific substructure converge . in our interpretation ( which we introduce in detail below ) , a sequence of structures is left - convergent ( or @xmath5-convergent ) if the probability of satisfaction of any fixed quantifier - free first - order formula by a random assignment of the free variables ( drawn uniformly and independently at random ) converges .",
    "( here @xmath5 stands for quantifier - free . )    in this paper we consider limits of algebras ( that is structures with functions but no relations ) , in the simplest case of one unary operation .",

    "mass transport principle _ , which amounts to say that for every borel subsets @xmath8 it holds @xmath9 an alternative description of graphing is as follows :",
    "a graphing is defined by a finite number of measure preserving involutions @xmath10 on a standard borel space , which define the edges of the graphing as the union of the orbits of size two of @xmath10 . using a proper edge coloring , every finite graph with maximum degree @xmath6",
    "can be represented by means of @xmath11 involutions @xmath12 .",
    "it is easily seen that a sequence of properly @xmath6-edge colored graphs is local convergent if and only if the corresponding sequence of finite algebras with function symbols @xmath13 is qf - convergent . in this sense ,",
    "qf - convergence seems to be more general than local - convergence .",
    "however , local convergence of graphs with maximum degree @xmath6 can be understood as the convergence , for every local first - order formula , of the probability of satisfaction of the formula for a random assignment of the free variables ( drawn uniformly and independently at random ) . for graphs with unbounded degrees",
    "this notion of convergence is then strictly stronger than qf - convergence , which does not allows quantification . even for algebras with a single function symbol ( but not required to be an involution almost everywhere ) ,",
    "the notion of local - convergence is stronger than qf - convergence .",
    "the idea to conceptualize limits of structures by means of convergence of the satisfaction probability of formulas in a fixed fragment of first - order logic has been introduced by two of the authors in @xcite . in this",

    "note that for every @xmath178 it holds @xmath179 thus @xmath180    let @xmath16 be a quantifier free formula with free variables @xmath177 and functional depth @xmath127 , and let @xmath181 be the formula @xmath182    as @xmath24 is atomless , it holds @xmath183 .",
    "also , it is easily checked that @xmath184 .",
    "let @xmath185 . then @xmath148 can be written as the conjunction of @xmath181 with a disjunction of mutually exclusive conjunctions of formulas of the form @xmath186 or @xmath187 ( with no @xmath188 of the form @xmath189 for some @xmath190 ) .",

    "altogether , we get that @xmath198    note that in the above construction , we construct approximations of order @xmath199 for some constant @xmath145 and sufficiently large ( but arbitrary ) @xmath19 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : invqfmap ] may be generalized to other fragments of first - order formulas .",
    "this is reflected for example by the following two results .",
    "[ thm : invfomap ] every atomless modeling mapping @xmath24 with finite model property that satisfies the finitary mass transport principle is the @xmath21-limit of an @xmath21-convergent sequence of finite mappings .",
    "we do not include the proofs of these results as they are lengthy and increasingly more model theory related .",
    "this will appear elsewhere and the interested reader may consult the companion paper @xcite , and we just give here a high level outline of the proofs of theorems  [ thm : invlocmap ] and  [ thm : invfomap ] . theorem  [ thm : invfomap ]",
    "is proved as follows :    1 .",
    "we first reduce to the case where the mapping modeling @xmath24 has no connected component of measure greater than @xmath200 ; 2 .",
    "we consider a derived modeling mapping @xmath201 obtained by removing all the elements with zero - measure rank-@xmath202 local type ; 3 .",
    "we cut all the short circuits by means of interpretation ; 4 .",
    "we approximate the measure on the rank-@xmath202 local types by a rational measure @xmath102 ; 5 .",
    "we construct a finite mapping @xmath30 such that the measure of each rank-@xmath7 local type @xmath203 is equal to what is derived from @xmath102 ; 6 .",
    "[ step : merge ] we consider a finite mapping @xmath204 , which is equivalent to @xmath24 up to a huge quantifier rank , and we merge it with a great number of copies of @xmath44 to form an @xmath21-approximation of @xmath24 ; 7 .",
    "using interpretation we deduce an @xmath21-approximation of the original mapping modeling .      1 .",
    "every connected modeling mapping is close ( in the sense of local convergence ) to a modeling mapping with finite height ; such a modeling mapping has the finite model property , hence maybe @xmath21-approximated thanks to theorem  [ thm : invfomap ] ; 2 .   for a mapping modeling without connected components of measure greater than @xmath200",
    "we construct a finite mapping @xmath30 as in the steps ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) of the proof of theorem  [ thm : invfomap ] ; 3 .",
    "then we complete @xmath30 by means of small models of missing necessary local types , merged with a great number of copies of @xmath30 ; 4 .",
    "the @xmath20 approximation is obtained as the disjoint union of the @xmath20 approximations of large connected components and the @xmath73 approximation of the remaining components ( after careful tuning of the respective orders ) .",
    "so we see that the question of limits is not easy , even for the simplest case of one mapping .",
    "it is an interesting question to try to extend these results for several mappings , say @xmath13 ( on a same set ) .",
    "but there are two warnings related to this :    first , for @xmath205 , we hope that the quantifier - free limits can be obtained by refining our approach .",
    "however , for @xmath205 this involves to consider subdivisions of ( large ) complete graphs and thus by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 27 ) we know that modeling fo - limits do not exist ( as subdivisions of complete graphs are forbidden in nowhere dense graphs , see @xcite ) .",
    "second , although for @xmath205 the qf - limits may exist , the inverse theorem ( which we established above for @xmath206 ) is a hard problem as it involves aldous - lyons conjecture @xcite . in this respect",
    "the above may shed more light on this difficult problem .",
