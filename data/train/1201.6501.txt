    "recently , great attention has been dedicated by the solar community to the study of magnetic field emergence events in sot / sp data .",
    "these were firstly pointed out either as small scale magnetic loops ( loop cases ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or magnetized emerging granules with a single magnetic polarity ( unipolar cases ; * ? ? ?",
    "latterly , in @xcite , an extensive analysis of approximately @xmath9 emerging loops anchored to the solar photosphere ( @xmath1 loops ) was presented . in @xcite",
    "both the topology and the dynamics of an emerging @xmath1 loop were derived .",
    "a similar study was presented in @xcite .",
    "more studies of magnetic field emergence events can be found in the literature : the ones of @xcite , and @xcite performed on data from tip @xcite , and the ones of @xcite , and @xcite performed on data from imax @xcite . a complete understanding of the emergence of magnetic fields in the quiet - sun could considerably improve our knowledge of the solar photosphere ( see the references in the introduction of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in spite of the rich literature on the emergence of magnetic fields in the solar photosphere",
    ", there is still a lack of knowledge about the typical polarimetric signatures associated to these events . in this work",
    ", the first analysis of the shapes of stokes  @xmath0 profiles measured at the locations of @xmath1 loop emergence events in sot / sp data is presented .",
    "the main goal of this study is to confirm the following prediction that can be outlined by considering the basic geometrical and physical properties of emerging @xmath1 loops : stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe are possibly the main polarimetric signature associated to such events in the quiet - sun .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the polarimetric signatures which are expected to be observed at the locations of an emerging @xmath1 loop are described in sect .",
    "[ pred ] ; the dataset and the analysis method adopted are presented in sect .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a cartoon drawing of a @xmath1 loop which is emerging in a field - free environment at the disk center .",
    "more precisely , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents the two phases which allow one to identify a loop emergence event in time - sequences of polarimetric data . in this figure ,",
    "the different layers of the solar photosphere are marked with average values of the optical depth at @xmath10  nm ( @xmath11 ) . in the initial phase ( ` a ` panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) the top of the loop , dominated by transversal magnetic fields with respect to the line - of - sight ( los ) of an observer ( e.g. ` obs1 ` ) , enters the photosphere producing a linear polarization signature ( usually on top of granules , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the following phase ( ` b ` panel in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , the loop emerges above the photosphere and two circular polarization signatures with opposite polarities , produced by the longitudinal fields with respect to the los , are observed ( e.g. by the observer ` obs2 ` ) .",
    "the polarization signatures associated to these two phases of a magnetic loop emergence event are commonly used as proxies to identify emerging loops in polarimetric observations of the quiet - sun ( see the references in sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) .",
    "however , an in - depth understanding of @xmath1 loop emergence events requires dealing with the details of polarization measurements . in (",
    "8) the authors derived the physical properties of an emerging @xmath1 loop by collecting one - dimensional ( 1d ) slices retrieved from inversions of polarization measurements .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the authors had to deal with stokes  @xmath0 profiles with strong asymmetries : two stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe were observed in two of the pixels of the loop ( see fig .  3 of * ?",
    "* ) . in the following it",
    "is shown that it is possible to predict that this kind of profiles are possibly the main polarimetric signature associated to emerging @xmath1 loops .",
    "the los ` obs2 ` , crossing one of the loop s foot - points in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , passes first through a field - free layer which fills the region @xmath12 , and then through a magnetized layer which fills the region @xmath13 .",
    "if the location of the foot - point crossed by ` obs2 ` is an up - flow ( as usual in emergence events ) , the plasma velocity along the los in the region @xmath13 is negative and of the order of several kilometers per second , while the same quantity in the region @xmath12 is expected to be considerably smaller in absolute value ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "from the extensive literature on the formation of strongly asymmetric stokes  @xmath0 profiles in visible spectral lines from 1d stratifications one can conclude that an atmospheric configuration like the one described above can give rise to a stokes  @xmath0 profile dominated by the blue lobe under very different conditions : for either sharp or smooth transitions between the magnetized region and the field - free one , for either strong or weak magnetic field regimes , for either vertical or inclined magnetic fields with respect to the los .",
    "conversely , if the foot - point is located in a down - flow , a profile dominated by the red lobe is very likely to be formed @xcite .     loop ( shaded area ) emerging above the solar photosphere .",
    "upper panel : initial phase producing the linear polarization signature .",

    "the upper photosphere layers are marked by the average @xmath15 levels ( horizontal dotted lines ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines show three los examples crossing the loop structure at different instants and locations .",
    "the arrows crossing the los represent the direction of the magnetic field vector.[fig1],width=226 ]    similar arguments can be used to predict that the atmospheric properties along the los ` obs3 ` can give rise to stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe as well @xcite .",
    "figure  3 of @xcite offers one a fast verification of the prediction outlined above . in sect .",
    "[ resdisc ] , much stronger arguments in favour of the connection between @xmath1 loop emergence events and the observation of stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe are presented .         profiles with @xmath16 as functions of @xmath17 .",
    "the solid line shows the abundances derived at the locations of emergence of magnetic loops ; the dashed line shows the ones derived from the complete quiet - sun dataset of all the time - sequences when considering the profiles with @xmath18 ( consistent with sect .",
    "[ data&meth ] ) .",
    "the dotted vertical line marks the threshold value here used to evaluate the abundances , i.e. @xmath19.[fig3],width=226 ]    the polarimetric signatures produced by the emerging @xmath1 loop in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are assumed to have dimensions larger than the resolution element of modern spectro - polarimetric observations , i.e. the loop structure is resolved .",
    "this assumption does not imply that the magnetic fields of the loop are completely resolved , it rather implies that a dominant @xmath1-shaped magnetic structure can be pointed out from the data .",
    "this structure is the one which is considered to be dominant in each pixel of the observed loops .",
    "for this reason one can use the properties of 1d stratifications to predict the asymmetries of stokes  @xmath0 profiles at the locations of emerging magnetic loops .",
    "in order to have a large statistics of stokes  @xmath0 profiles from the locations of emerging magnetic loops one can use the time - sequences analyzed in @xcite .",
    "this is so far the study with the richest record of emergence events of @xmath1 loops in the quiet - sun . in detail",
    ", all the time - sequences reported in table  1 of @xcite , with exception made for the sequence of september @xmath20th ( due to problems in downloading the dataset from the _ hinode _ archive ) , were analyzed .",

    "as reported in sect .",
    "[ pred ] , a magnetic @xmath1 loop can be identified in polarimetric data as `` a linear polarization signature flanked by circular polarization signatures with opposite polarities '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the analysis here presented , those events in which the linear and circular polarization signatures had , at least for one wavelength , max@xmath21 and max@xmath22 in each pixel , respectively , were considered .",
    "besides this , a minimum area of four pixels for each polarization signature was required amplitude above three times the polarimetric sensitivity of the observations , i.e. @xmath23 in units of the average continuum intensity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , were considered .",
    "the higher threshold for the individuation of the linear polarization signature allows one to point out sound cases . ] .",
    "each emergence event was taken out of the time - sequences by picking out a sub - sequence of sub - fields ( of @xmath24  arcsec@xmath25 ) around the location where the emergence was found to take place .",
    "spurious polarimetric signals due to magnetic fields in the selected sub - fields were then carefully removed along the whole sub - sequence by visual inspection .",
    "an example of emergence event extracted from the analyzed sequences is shown in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in which both the linear and the circular polarization signatures that allow one to point out the @xmath1 loop were marked ( contours ) . a total of @xmath26 events were found in the analyzed sequences ; these presented a large variety of properties which were investigated in detail in @xcite . here the abundance of stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe at the locations of the circular polarization signatures of the loops was studied .    the lower row of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a fraction of the stokes  @xmath0 profiles at the locations of the circular polarization signatures of the emergence event in the upper row . in detail , among the stokes  @xmath0 profiles observed at the locations of the circular polarization signatures of the @xmath1 loop , the ones with @xmath27 were represented ( @xmath28 ) is the amplitude of the blue ( red ) lobe . ] .",
    "@xmath29 is the amplitude asymmetry of a stokes  @xmath0 : the higher the @xmath30 the more the stokes  @xmath0 is dominated by one lobe .",
    "one can understand the formation the stokes  @xmath0 profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by referring to sect .",
    "[ pred ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( ` obs2 ` ) .",
    "the signature with the positive polarity , mostly located in a down - flow , is characterized by stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by the red lobe .",
    "the negative one , located on a bright granule , is characterized by profiles dominated by the blue lobe .",
    "the observations of these polarimetric signatures were predicted in sect .",
    "[ pred ] .    by exploiting all the @xmath26 @xmath1 loop emergence events individuated in the analyzed time - sequences one can analyze more profiles and , eventually , evaluate the abundance of stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe at the locations of such events . to do this , all the stokes  @xmath0 profiles from the circular polarization signatures which allow one to identify the emergence events were collected",
    "; these were @xmath31 profiles .",
    "those profiles with @xmath32 were the ones considered to be dominated by one lobe ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the stokes  @xmath0 profiles with @xmath3 make up @xmath33 of the @xmath31 of the whole archive ( i.e. @xmath2% ) .",
    "this means that nearly one in every two stokes  @xmath0 profiles observed at the locations of emerging magnetic loops is dominated either by the blue lobe or by the red lobe .",
    "such a result confirms the prediction made in sect .",
    "[ pred ] , and allows one to put forward stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe as a new proxy for emerging @xmath1 loops in polarimetric observations with good spectral sampling . even though the abundance here derived stemmed from an arbitrary threshold on the amplitude asymmetry of the analyzed circular polarization signals , the plenitude of stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe at the locations of emerging magnetic loops can be proved in an alternative way .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the abundances for different values of the threshold ( @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) on the amplitude asymmetry in both the sample described at the end of sect .",
    "[ data&meth ] and the complete quiet - sun dataset of all the time - sequences . on the one hand",
    ", the result reveals that the abundance strongly depends on the threshold value . on the other hand",
    ", it shows that there is a considerable excess of profiles with large @xmath30 at the locations of loop emergence events with respect to the quiet - sun .",
    "this result does not depend on the value of the threshold , and further supports the prediction made in sect.[pred ] .",
    "polarimetric observations of loop emergence events performed with other instruments do not present the same abundance of extremely asymmetric profiles .",
    "@xcite presented a study of the shapes of stokes  @xmath0 profiles observed in the two infra - red ( ir ) lines at @xmath34  nm with tip @xcite at @xmath35  arcsec spatial resolution .",
    "the profiles they showed in fig .",
    "2 are anti - symmetric profiles .",
    "such a lack of asymmetry can be understood by referring to @xcite in which the authors explained the different conditions which produce strong asymmetries in stokes  @xmath0 profiles in the visible and in the ir . in @xcite",
    "the authors pointed out the observation of asymmetric profiles in one emergence event observed with imax @xcite in the  @xmath36  nm line .",
    "a detailed analysis of the profiles observed by imax at the locations of emergence events would be important to complement the study presented here .",
    "finally , the results shown here allow one to complement the knowledge about the origin of stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe observed by sot / sp in the quiet - sun .",
    "in detail , in @xcite the authors reported on the observation of such profiles at the borders of network patches in the dataset of @xcite , while in @xcite these were found at the locations of unipolar emergence events .",
    "the first study of the shapes of stokes  @xmath0 profiles observed at the locations of emerging magnetic @xmath1 loops found in sot / sp time - sequences of the quiet - sun is presented .",
    "it focuses on those loops which can be pointed out adopting the standard method based on the detection of both linear and circular polarization signatures in _ hinode _ time - sequences of the quiet - sun ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath2% of the profiles observed at the locations of such events have an amplitude asymmetry @xmath3 , i.e. are dominated by either the blue lobe or the red lobe .",
    "such a value quantifies the excess of the profiles dominated by one lobe at the locations of magnetic loop emergence events with respect to their abundance in the complete quiet - sun dataset of all the time - sequences .",
    "this result confirms the prediction of the stokes  @xmath0 profiles that are expected to be observed at the locations of emerging loops outlined in sect .",
    "the different los crossing the structure of a loop are expected to define 1d stratifications which are known to produce stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe under very different conditions in visible spectral lines @xcite .",
    "the large abundance of these profiles at the locations of loop emergence events confirms the goodness of the physical scenarios so far proposed to interpret such events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may prompt the use of stokes  @xmath0 profiles dominated by one lobe as proxies to individuate emerging magnetic loops in spectropolarimetric observations with good spectral sampling .",
    "the work presented here must be considered as a starting point for more refined studies of emergence events which , for example , might be aimed to : point out various emergence configurations , understand the temporal evolution of the stokes  @xmath0 profiles as a loop emerges / evolves , measure the siphon - flows into the loops .    the author is grateful to the anonymous referee for the comments which allowed to considerably improve the whole manuscript .",
