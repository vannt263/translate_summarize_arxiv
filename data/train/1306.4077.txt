    "partially ionized , optical thin gas along our line of sight into the nuclei of several agn can absorb the soft x - rays .",
    "this partially ionized material has come to be known as the `` warm absorber '' @xcite .",

    "constraining the location and geometry , knowledge of the state and dynamics of these different components that make up the environment around agn , is important to understand how the central engine accretes matter and any feedback the agn may have in terms of matter outflow to the galaxy .",

    "there is an extended scattering medium along the axis of the torus , which scatters some of the photons to our line of sight .",

    "@xcite explained the soft x - ray continuum of ngc 1068 and circinus galaxy observed by _ bepposax _ due to the combined presence of a scattered power law emission and an optically thin plasma emission and estimated column densities of the warm scatterer as @xmath17 10@xmath18  @xmath5 and @xmath7 a few @xmath19 10@xmath20  @xmath5 respectively .",

    "@xcite modeled the scattering emission as a secondary power law component in the _ asca _ spectra of a sample of eight seyfert 2 galaxies and a warm scattering medium in ngc 4151 was observed by @xcite .",
    "_ suzaku _ broadband observations of obscured seyfert galaxy mcg  @xmath21 revealed a soft excess below 1 kev which was explained by emission from scattered continuum photons and distant photoionized gas .",
    "it was deduced that this source was viewed at moderate ( @xmath22 ) inclination through compton - thin matter at the edge of a compton - thick torus covering @xmath23 steradians , consistent with unified models @xcite .",
    "further studies with _ suzaku _ showed that for two sources the scattered light constituted a small fraction ( @xmath24 ) of the nuclear emission @xcite .",
    "this suggested a scenario in which there was a geometrically thick torus with a small opening angle and/or very small amount of gas responsible for scattering .",

    "suzaku _ spectrum of markarian 3 which was resolved into weak , soft power - law emission , a heavily absorbed power law component , cold reflection , and emission lines .",
    "the weak , soft power law emission was considered to be scattered light by ionized gas with a scattering fraction of @xmath25 @xcite . the possibility of scattering from an ionized medium was discussed in the _ suzaku _ analysis of seyfert 2 ngc 4945 @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study by @xcite using _ xmm - newton _ observations of 32 obscured agn investigated their multi - wavelength properties in relation to the scattering fraction .",
    "the sample covered a broad range of the scattering fraction ( @xmath26 ) ; with eight agn exhibiting low scattering fraction ( @xmath27 ) suggesting that they are buried in a geometrically thick torus with a very small opening angle .",
    "they found no significant correlation between scattering fraction and far - infrared luminosity and a weak anti - correlation between the eddington ratio and scattering fraction .",

    "@xcite also studied mrk 3 and found no variability in the soft component over a 10 year long period although the hard component changed by a factor of 6 during 3 years .",
    "it was suggested that if most of the soft x - rays from mrk 3 were scattered , the large time lag indicated that the distance of the scatterer from the nucleus is comparable to 6 lt - yr ( @xmath28 pc ) .",

    ", the matter is optically thick to compton scattering which makes the nucleus almost invisible .",
    "hence the broad iron line can not be detected in this scenario .",
    "however , for seyfert 2 agn with relatively low values of @xmath183 10@xmath178 @xmath5 , where one sees through the outer edge of the putative cold torus , central x - ray emission above a few kev can penetrate the torus making the nuclear source visible to the observer .",
    "this picture would allow the detection of broad fe k emission line consistent with the unification scheme .",
    "the presence of absorption edge at @xmath7 8.2 kev in the second xmm - newton observation of iras 18325 - 5926 ( obsid:0022940201 ) may suggest the possible link to the scattering medium , but it also depends on whether the x - rays are absorbed by the scattering medium or not .    a speculative but consistent scenario for the agn seems to be that the source has a bi - polar outflow with a mass outflow rate comparable to the accretion one . however with a kinetic power much smaller than the radiative luminosity .",
    "the outflow is highly ionized to a distance of @xmath184 cm , with a column density of @xmath185 @xmath5 , beyond which there may be partially ionized gas .",
    "the source is surrounded by a torus at a distance of @xmath186 cm . a fraction of the primary x - rays scatter into our line of sight from the ionized outflow .",
    "a more systematic study of several such sources and theoretical hydro - dynamical simulations have to be undertaken to validate this geometry .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the _ suzaku _ satellite , a collaborative mission between the space agencies of japan ( jaxa ) and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "we would like to thank the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ mission teams for developing excellent instruments .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for the careful reading of the manuscript and useful comments ."

    "<S> we analyze suzaku and xmm - newton data of the highly variable seyfert 2 , iras 18325 - 5926 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the source are well modeled as a primary component described as an absorbed power law and a secondary power law component which is consistent with being scattered emission from an on - axis extended highly ionized medium . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while the primary component varies on a wide range of timescales from @xmath0 s , the scattered emission is variable only on timescales longer than @xmath1 s. this implies that the extent of the scattering medium is greater than @xmath2 cm . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the scattered to primary flux ( @xmath3 ) implies a column density for the scattering medium to be @xmath4 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that for such a medium to be highly ionized it must be located less than @xmath6 cm from the x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> thus we localize the position and extent of scattering region to be @xmath7 a few @xmath8 cm , with an average particle density of @xmath9 @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the physical interpretation of these results and as an aside , we confirm the presence of a broad iron line emission in both the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations . </S>"
