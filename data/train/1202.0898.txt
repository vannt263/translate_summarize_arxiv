    "it is not known whether this region is the true capacity region since the traditional gallager - type technique for proving converses fails to work in this case .",
    "this raises the question of whether marton s inner bound has an alternative representation that is better amenable to analysis .",
    "could it even be the case that marton s inner bound matches the true capacity region ?",
    "if so , is it possible that we just have not got the right way to go about proving a converse to marton s inner bound.we believe that central to answering this question is understanding properties of joint distributions @xmath12 corresponding to extreme points of marton s inner bound .",
    "our approach to this is twofold . roughly speaking in the first part of this paper we find _ sufficient _ conditions on the optimizing distributions @xmath12 which would imply a kind of factorization of marton s inner bound .",
    "such a factorization would imply that marton s region is the correct rate region . in the second part we find _ necessary _ conditions on any optimizing @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately the gap between these sufficient and necessary conditions is still wide .",
    "however we discuss how the necessary conditions may enhance our understanding of the maximizers of the expression @xmath13 and how it may be useful in proving the factorization of marton s inner bound .",
    "the question of whether marton s inner bound matches one of the known outer bounds has been studied in several works recently @xcite . since we build upon these results in this work , a brief literature review is in order .",

    "a gap between the bounds was demonstrated for the bssc in @xcite without explicitly having to evaluate the inner bound .",
    "the conjectured inequality for this channel was established in @xcite and hence marton s sum - rate for bssc was explicitly evaluated .",

    "suppose we have certain properties of @xmath12 that maximize marton s inner bound .",
    "how can one use this to prove that marton s inner bound is tight ?",
    "the traditional gallager - type technique requires us to consider the @xmath20-letter expression and to try to identify single - letter auxiliary random variables . if any such statement can be shown , it has to hold for @xmath21 in particular .",
    "but the traditional gallager type technique imposes certain structures on the choice of single - letter auxiliary random variables ( they have to consist of past / future of the auxiliary random variables ) . to relax this constraint the authorsin @xcite",
    ", the authors studied marton s inner bound ( sum - rate ) via a two - letter approach and there they presented an approach to test whether marton s inner bound is indeed optimal .",
    "the crux of the paper @xcite is a certain _ factorization idea _ which if established would yield the optimality of marton s inner bound for discrete memoryless broadcast channels .",
    "further the authors used the same idea to show @xcite an example of a class of broadcast channels where marton s inner bound is tight and the best known outer bounds are strictly loose .",
    "the converse to the capacity region of this class of broadcast channels was motivated by the factorization approach .",
    "the authors also showed that the factorizing approach works if an optimizer @xmath22 for the two - letter marton s inner bound satisfies certain conditions .",
    "in this paper we provide more sufficient conditions that imply factorization by forming a more refined version of the two - letter approach @xcite .",
    "simulations conducted on randomly generated binary input broadcast channels indicate that perhaps the factorization stated below ( conjecture [ co : conj ] ) is true ; thus indicating that marton s inner bound could be optimal .    for any broadcast channel @xmath23 , define @xmath24 note that @xmath25 is a function of @xmath26 for a given broadcast channel .",

    "the veracity of the conjecture becomes an important direction in studying the optimality of marton s inner bound .",
    "the validity of conjecture [ co : conj ] was established @xcite in the following three instances :    1 .",
    "@xmath37 , i.e. the extreme points of the interval , 2 .",

    "@xcite than receiver @xmath40 if @xmath41 than receiver @xmath42 .",
    "note that to establish the conjecture one needs to get a better handle on @xmath25 .",
    "what inequality shows is that when @xmath43 then @xmath44 in this work , we seek generalizations of the inequality in two different directions :    * _ to the entire private messages region _ : maximizing @xmath45 for a given @xmath26 is related to the sum - rate computation of marton s inner bound .",
    "if one is interested in the entire private messages region , one must deal with a slightly more general form and this is presented in section [ sse : gen ] . * _ beyond binary input alphabets _ : the inequality itself fails to hold where @xmath46 , for instance in the blackwell channel , with the mapping @xmath47 given by : @xmath48 . ] .",

    "however this conjecture is not equivalent to proving the optimality of marton s inner bound ; indeed it is a stronger statement .",

    "<S> results in efficient evaluation of the region , but it may also help one to prove factorization of marton s inner bound ( and thus its optimality ) . the first part of this paper formulates this factorization approach explicitly and states some conjectures and results along this line . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of this paper focuses primarily on the structure of the optimizers . </S>",
    "<S> this section is inspired by a new binary inequality that recently resulted in a very simple characterization of the sum - rate of marton s inner bound for binary input broadcast channels . </S>",
    "<S> this prompted us to investigate whether this inequality can be extended to larger cardinality input alphabets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that several of the results for the binary input case do carry over for higher cardinality alphabets and we present a collection of results that help restrict the search space of probability distributions to evaluate the boundary of marton s inner bound in the general case . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove a new inequality for the binary skew - symmetric broadcast channel that yields a very simple characterization of the entire marton inner bound for this channel . </S>"
