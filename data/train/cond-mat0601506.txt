    "recently multiferroics with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism have been intensively studied not only due to potential applications but also from basic interest  @xcite . in particular , bimno@xmath5 is regarded as a true multiferroic material with both ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity .",
    "@xmath1 possesses a distorted perovskite structure with monoclinic symmetry due to highly polarizable bismuth ions and jahn - teller ( jt ) active manganese ions .",
    "its magnetic moment certainly arises from the @xmath6 electrons of @xmath7 ion , while the ferroelectric polarization does from the bi @xmath8 lone pair  @xcite .",
    "the saturated magnetization for a polycrystalline sample was reported to be 3.6 @xmath9 and the ferromagnetic transition temperature 105 k  @xcite .",
    "while the ferroelectric remanent polarization of bimno@xmath5 was measured to be 0.043 @xmath10 at 200 k for a polycrystalline sample  @xcite , there seems to be no consensus on the ferroelectric transition temperature @xmath11 .",
    "moreira dos santos @xmath12 @xmath13 , for example , reported @xmath14450 k where a reversible structural transition occurs without a symmetry change  @xcite ; however , kimura @xmath12 @xmath13 suggested @xmath15770 k where a centrosymmetric - noncentrosymmetric structural transition occurs  @xcite .    in bimno@xmath5 orbital degrees of freedom",
    "are also active besides magnetic and electric ones ; the half - filled @xmath16 level of @xmath7 ion induces the jt distortion and an anisotropic charge distribution with the @xmath17 orbital prevails locally",
    ". then long range orbital order , which is compatible with the structure , would exist in the system .",
    "the detailed structure of bimno@xmath5 at room temperature was investigated by neutron powder diffraction and the compatible orbital order was proposed  @xcite .",
    "it is noted that no noticeable structural change associated with the ferromagnetic transition was observed .",
    "regarding the orbital order in @xmath1 , there remain unresolved issues such as the temperature dependence of the degree of ordering at high temperatures and the determination of the transition temperature itself , @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the relationship between the ferroelectricity and the orbital order in this multiferroic compound is clearly of interest .    in order to address these issues we took advantage of resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) which can probe local environments of a specific element .",
    "rxs occurs as a second order process by first exciting a core electron into an empty valence state , as the incident photon energy is tuned to an absorption edge , and then de - exciting the electron back to the original state .",
    "direct involvement of the valence state in the scattering process usually gives rise to enhanced sensitivity to anisotropic charge distributions , and the atomic scattering factor is no longer a scalar but takes a tensorial form called anisotropic tensor susceptibility ( ats ) .",
    "ats then allows reflections at some of normally forbidden positions .",
    "pioneering works regarding ats were done in the eighties  @xcite , and more recently murakami @xmath12 @xmath13 successfully applied rxs to several orbital ordered compounds  @xcite . here",
    "we wish to present detailed rxs measurements for @xmath19 to reveal a role of the orbital order in this important multiferroic compound .",
    "the energy profile , azimuthal angle dependence , and temperature dependence of an ats reflection peak will be presented and discussed .",
    "in order to carry out rxs measurements single crystalline samples are needed , but bimno@xmath5 is notoriously difficult to synthesize in a single crystalline form .",
    "thus we resorted to epitaxial films ; an epitaxial film of bimno@xmath5 was grown on a srtio@xmath5(111 ) substrate ( cubic miller indices ) by the pulsed laser deposition technique .",
    "the thickness of the film was approximately 40 nm .",
    "the detailed growth conditions and structural characterizations are presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure of the thin film was still monoclinic as in bulk .",
    "the growth direction or surface - normal direction , which is parallel to the [ 111 ] direction of the substrate , is perpendicular to the monoclinic @xmath20-plane . note that with this orientation the modulation vector of the orbital ordering of bimno@xmath5 is along the surface - normal .",
    "( see below . )",
    "thus the orientation of the film was deliberately chosen in order to make the axis of azimuthal rotation ( direction of the scattering vector ) coincide with the surface - normal , so that azimuthal scans are easily performed .",
    "resonant x - ray scattering experiments were performed on a 4-circle diffractometer installed at the 3c2 beam line in the pohang light source .",
    "the photon energy near mn @xmath0-edge was calibrated using a manganese foil and the resolution was about 2 ev . the @xmath21 polarized photon ( electric field perpendicular to the scattering plane ) was injected after being focused by a bent mirror and monochromatized by a si(111 ) double crystal .",
    "the linearly polarized @xmath22 ( electric field perpendicular to the scattering plane ) and @xmath23 ( electric field in the scattering plane ) components of scattered photons were separated with a flat pyrolithic graphite crystal with the scattering angle of 69 @xmath24 for the mn @xmath0-edge .",
    "from the neutron powder diffraction with bulk samples at room temperature the space group ( monoclinic @xmath26 ) and local bond lengths and angles of bimno@xmath5 were all determined  @xcite , and it turned out that this monoclinic structure is maintained in thin films  @xcite . the crystallographic unit cell is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bmofig](a ) .",
    "note that @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the crystallographic axes ( and the lattice parameters ) for the monoclinic unit cell , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the axes of the perovskite pseudo - cubic cell .",
    "the structure also determines the orientation of jt - distorted mno@xmath33 s and the compatible ordered pattern of the @xmath16 orbitals of mn@xmath34 .",
    "the monoclinic @xmath20-planes at @xmath35 and @xmath36 contain manganese ions with the @xmath16 orbital elongated to the pseudo - cubic @xmath32-axis @xmath37 , while the orbitals in the @xmath20-planes at @xmath38 and @xmath39 are of type @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath42 denotes the coordinate along the @xmath29-axis and @xmath43 designates a small displacement . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bmofig](b ) , this orbital order is rather peculiar in the sense that each plane parallel to the @xmath20-plane and separated by @xmath44 contains only one kind of the @xmath16 orbital within the plane and the stacking sequence goes as @xmath37/@xmath41/@xmath37/@xmath40/@xmath45(@xmath46 ) .",
    "this long range orbital order corresponds to the superstructure of the system , and the periodic arrangement of the anisotropic charge distributions would give rise to measurable intensities at ( 00l ) ats reflections with odd l where normal charge scattering is almost absent ( not completely absent because of nonzero @xmath43 ) .    with the crystal structure just described the structure factor @xmath47 for bimno@xmath5 ( odd l ) can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 represent the ats of the manganese ion with anisotropic @xmath16 orbitals elongated along @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively , and @xmath52 is symbolic of the contribution of thomson scattering ( normal charge scattering ) due to bismuth and oxygen ions .",
    "@xmath51 , for example , may be written , based on the pseudocubic axes shown in fig .",
    "[ bmofig ] , as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 stand for the resonant scattering amplitude with photon polarization perpendicular and parallel to the @xmath16 elongation direction , respectively .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eqsf ] ) becomes    @xmath56    where @xmath57 denotes the isotropic part of the scattering factor of manganese , and @xmath58 @xmath59 denotes the anisotropic portion .",
    "note that these ( 00l ) reflections with odd l are allowed even in the absence of resonant scattering because the slight displacement @xmath43 of mn ions from the exact position prohibits perfect cancellation of the various contributions .",
    "@xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eqsf ] ) probably also contributes .",
    "ats reflections are usually so small that the observation of rxs is normally difficult in the presence of the background .",
    "the anomalous ats reflections from the bimno@xmath5 film , however , were measurable because the charge scattering background at the ( 00l ) peaks turned out to be reduced by a factor of @xmath60 compared to the intensity of the fundamental ( 004 ) peak .",
    "in fig . 2(a ) schematically shown is the experimental configuration for rxs . again",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 represent the polarization of the incident and scattered photons .",
    "azimuthal rotation and analyzer configuration are also indicated in the figure .",
    "the fluorescence was measured as a function of photon energy to determine the mn @xmath0 absorption edge .",
    "the absorption from the manganese ion results in the uprise of fluorescence above 6.55 kev indicating the mn @xmath0 absorption edge as presented in fig .",
    "[ bmoene](b ) .",
    "the integrated intensity of the ( 003 ) reflection was measured as a function of photon energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ bmoene](c ) . as expected from the resonant nature ,",
    "the intensity is sharply enhanced at 6.552 kev in contrast to the normal charge scattering intensity which would decrease instead from absorption .",
    "note that at off - resonance energies , appreciable integrated intensity remains , instead of decaying to zero , as a result of normal charge scattering described above .",
    "another interesting point is that , as shown in the two energy profiles at different temperatures ( 300 k , 600 k ) , the resonant contribution decreases with temperature in contrast to the off - resonant part which remains nearly constant .",
    "even if the peak occurred at the expected position in the reciprocal space , this fact alone may not be sufficient to conclude that orbital ordering is indeed the origin of the scattering .",
    "the hall mark of the resonant scattering due to orbital ordering would be the polarization dependence and azimuthal variation of the peak intensity .",
    "in contrast to conventional x - ray scattering which neither depends on the azimuthal angle nor shows polarization conversion , resonant scattering would exhibit the characteristic oscillations , depending on the photon polarization , with respect to the azimuthal angle , i.e. , the rotation angle around the scattering vector . thus in order to further confirm the orbital order as the origin of this resonant reflection , the azimuthal angle dependence and polarization analysis were carried out . in fig .",
    "[ bmopol ] presented is the azimuthal angle dependence of the ( 003 ) integrated intensity normalized with the fundamental ( 004 ) peak intensity in order to remove sample - shape effects .",
    "the zero of the azimuthal angle @xmath61 is defined when @xmath62 coincides with the @xmath63 axis . @xmath64 and @xmath65 , of course ,",
    "represent the propagation vector of incident and scattered beams , respectively . for the @xmath2 channel , a clear three - fold oscillation",
    "is observed , while the intensity does not exhibit any azimuthal dependence for @xmath3 .",
    "no doubt this polarization dependence and the three - fold oscillation seen in the @xmath2 channel are due to orbital ordering .",
    "it is noted , however , that these results are not trivially connected to the orbital order of bimno@xmath5 .",
    "what is required is one further step of taking into consideration the effects of twins which always exist in the film ; the detailed accounts are given in a separate section which follows .",
    "the temperature variation of the orbital order was elucidated by measuring the ( 003 ) integrated intensities at two different photon energies , 6.532 kev and 6.552 kev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bmotemp ] .",
    "while the data obtained at off - resonance energy 6.532 kev are solely due to thomson scattering ( normal charge scattering ) , those rxs data at 6.552 kev are caused by the ats reflection .",
    "the temperature profile of the rxs data shows two distinct features : one is that the peak intensity decreases rather rapidly with temperature and disappears around 770 k. the other is that an anomaly in the temperature variation appears around 440 k , below which there is a sudden upturn in the slope .",
    "the former corresponds to the transition temperature of the centrosymmetric - noncentrosymmetric structural phase transition in bulk  @xcite .",
    "the ( 003 ) integrated intensity at off - resonance energy 6.532 kev shows a normal behavior , i.e. , decreases with temperature due to thermal vibrations , and will disappear at the structural phase transition point .",
    "the lower temperature 440 k also coincide with the transition temperature found in bulk ; in this case the phase transition involved is the one without a symmetry change .",
    "these two temperatures are currently under controversy as a point below which ferroelectricity first appears . at high temperatures , it should be noted , it is not trivial at all to prove ferroelectricity of a material . at any rate ,",
    "the present rxs results prove that there is a strong connection between the ferroelectricity and orbital order in bimno@xmath5 .",
    "of course , the orbital order also determines the exchange interactions and consequently the magnetic ordering .",
    "the azimuthal angle dependence of the scattering intensity from the anomalous part proportional to @xmath66 of eq .",
    "( [ eqsf2 ] ) can be calculated for the experimental configuration shown in fig .",
    "the conversion matrix ( @xmath67 ) from the laboratory frame ( @xmath68 ) to the pseudo - cubic crystallographic frame ( @xmath69 ) is given by @xmath70 the polarization vector of the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath71 polarizations under azimuthal rotation by the amount of @xmath61 can be written in the laboratory frame as follows : @xmath72    where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the bragg angle , and @xmath75 is the azimuthal rotation matrix given by @xmath76    from these quantities the scattering intensity caused by ats with @xmath21 as the polarization of the incident photons is easily calculated for the two channels , @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 simplifying this equation yields the scattering intensities as @xmath80    there is one more factor to be considered before comparison with the experimental data is attempted , that is , the existence of twins has to be taken into account .",
    "the films grown on srtio@xmath5(111 ) would include three kinds of stacking sequences of orbitals , i.e. , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "note that the growth direction , which is the cubic [ 111 ] direction , is perpendicular to monoclinic ( 001 ) or @xmath20- planes .",
    "thus the measured intensities would be the ones obtained after averaging for the twins : @xmath84 after twin averaging , the calculated expressions as a function of @xmath61 agree with the experimental results depicted in the fig .",
    "[ bmopol ] .",
    "the data for the @xmath3 channel do not show any @xmath61 dependence , whereas for the @xmath2 channel a characteristic 3-fold symmetry is exhibited .",
    "the resonant x - ray scattering technique was used with epitaxial thin films to probe the orbital ordering of a multiferroic compound , @xmath1 .",
    "ats reflection was observed at ( 003 ) in the reciprocal space as expected , and the characteristic three - fold oscillation showed up as a function of azimuthal angle .",
    "the experimental results agree with the calculation based on the orbital ordering when twin effects are taken into account .",
    "the peak intensity was followed as a function of temperature to high temperatures ; it rapidly decreases with temperature and disappears at @xmath85770 k. thus orbital ordering occurs concurrent with the centrosymmetric - noncentrosymmetric structural phase transition seen in bulk .",
    "the peak intensity also shows an anomaly at 440 k , where again a phase transition was observed in bulk .",
    "although there is no consensus about the ferroelectric phase transition point in bimno@xmath5 , being either 440 k or 770 k , the orbital ordering is closely connected to the ferroelectricity in the system in either case ."
