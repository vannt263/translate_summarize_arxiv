    "m15 is renowned for containing the first globular cluster low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ; x2127 + 119 ) to be optically identified ( with ac211 , see aurire , le fevre & terzan 1984 and charles , jones & naylor 1986 ) , a counterpart that is still one of the most optically luminous of all lmxbs .",
    "ac211 is also the first globular cluster x - ray source to have both an optical and x - ray demonstration of its 17.1 hour orbital period via extended , partial eclipses ( see ilovaisky et al . 1993 and ioannou et al . 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "subsequent studies of m15 show that it contains additional exotic , highly evolved binaries .",
    "for example , there are at least 8 millisecond pulsars ( msp ) , 6 of them within 8 arcsec of the cluster core ( kulkarni & anderson 1996 ) .",
    "two of these msps have a negative @xmath0 ( i.e. an acceleration toward us as they move in the cluster potential ) implying a mass concentration of @xmath1 4000 @xmath2 at the cluster centre ( phinney 1996 ) .",
    "phinney argues that this mass _ can not _ consist of low - mass stars and is either a central black hole , or more likely a concentration of stellar remnants : neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "m15 is one of the most metal - poor globular clusters known ( [ fe / h ] @xmath32.1 ) and has a low reddening factor ( e@xmath4 ; harris 1996 ) .",
    "a recent study has refined the distance to m15 to 9.98@xmath50.47  kpc ( mcnamara , harrison & baumgardt 2004 ) which places it 5% closer than the previously quoted value of 10.4@xmath50.8  kpc ( durrell & harris 1993 ) .",
    "mcnamara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also provide a new estimate for the age and the mass of the cluster which are 13.2@xmath51.5  gyr and ( 4.5@xmath50.5)@xmath6   respectively .",
    "m15 s main - sequence turn - off point lies at @xmath7 .",
    "m15 was for a long time believed to be a classic example of a central - surface - brightness - cusp globular cluster ( newell & oneill 1978 ; djorgovski & king 1986 ; peterson , seitzer & cudworth 1989 ) , i.e. a cluster which has undergone core - collapse , with a small ( @xmath1 0.06 pc ) , densely - crowded core containing many non - luminous remnants , or even a single , massive black hole .",
    "however , more recent work shows that m15 s core , while compact , is larger than previously thought ( 0.13 pc ; lauer et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the central velocity dispersion lower ( @xmath1 10 km  s@xmath8 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "1992 ) . as a result",
    ", it is no longer possible to tell whether m15 has , in fact , undergone core - collapse : a classical pre - collapse , thermal equilibrium cluster model fits the data just as well as post - collapse models with a re - expanding core ( grabhorn et al .",
    "1992 ; de marchi & paresce 1994 ) .    recently , van der marel et al . ( 2002 ) and gerssen et al . ( 2002 , 2003 ) , using longslit spectra obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , have shown that radial velocity measurements are consistent with a central dark mass .",
    "models of the data which include a central black hole of mass @xmath9   fit the data slightly better than models without one .",
    "however , a central concentration of non - luminous , massive stellar remnants fits the data just as well , as shown in the dynamical simulations of baumgardt et al . ( 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , the _ chandra _ x - ray images presented by white & angelini ( 2001 ) show no evidence for any x - ray emission at the cluster centre , again indicating that it is unlikely to harbour a central black hole ( see also ho , terashima & okajima 2003 ) .    one of the primary motivations for this project was to attempt to solve one of x2127 + 119/ac211 s biggest mysteries : the x - ray and optical light curves , and its very low / , show unambiguously that it is an accretion disc corona source ( e.g. ilovaisky et al . 1993 ; ioannou et al .",
    "2002 ) , in which the compact object is obscured at all times by the accretion disc . but luminous type i x - ray bursts have been observed from the system ( e.g. dotani et al . 1990 ) , requiring that a neutron star is visible ( at least at certain times ) !",
    "we inferred therefore that x2127 + 119 may actually consist of _ two _ luminous x - ray binaries in m15 s core , too close together to be resolved by previous x - ray observations ( charles , clarkson & van zyl 2002 ) .",
    "this suggested exploiting _",
    "chandra s _ superb @xmath10.5-arcsec spatial resolution , and the result was the high resolution camera ( hrc - i ) images presented here , in order to search for additional sources close to ac211 .",
    "however , before the hrc - i observations were performed , white & angelini ( 2001 ) serendipitously resolved x2127 + 119 into two bright lmxbs with the zero - order acis - s / hetg image .",
    "m15  x-2 was found to be associated with a @xmath10 star located 2.7 arcsec from ac211 and 3.3 arcsec nw of the cluster core .",
    "while m15  x-2 is @xmath14 mag fainter than ac211 , it has an x - ray count rate @xmath12.5 times greater .",
    "nothing is known yet about the nature of m15  x-2 , other than that ",
    "if we assume it to be responsible for the type i x - ray bursts ( and thereby resolving the controversy of ac211 s x - ray properties )  the compact object is a neutron star .",
    "this then leaves the nature of the object in ac211 unconstrained .",
    "high resolution x - ray imaging is now revealing a wide range of low - luminosity sources in globular clusters ( see e.g. heinke et al .",
    "2003a ; hakala et al .",
    "the advent of _ chandra _ has made it possible to investigate these sources in earnest . some of the first results , ( e.g. pooley et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , show detections of cvs in the globular clusters ngc  6752 and ngc  6440 .",
    "dozens of low - luminosity x - ray sources have also been discovered in @xmath11 cen and ngc  6397 ( see verbunt & lewin 2004 for a recent review ) , and @xmath1300 in 47 tuc ( heinke et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these studies are narrowing the gap between the predicted and observed cv population densities , but have been primarily restricted to the cases of those clusters that do _ not _ contain central luminous steady lmxbs .",
    "however , one should note that a number of studies has emerged recently using _ chandra _ to look for faint sources in globular clusters which do contain bright lmxbs , e.g. heinke , edmonds & grindlay ( 2001 ) , heinke et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , wijnands et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , homer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "m15 is a good cluster to hunt for cvs and lmxbs because of its large mass and high compactness : its very dense core should be an ideal breeding ground for cvs and lmxbs ( as indicated already by the msp population ) .",
    "in addition , its very low reddening will not hinder the uv / optical identification of any new sources that are found .",
    "what are the chances of optically detecting a dwarf nova ( dn ) in outburst in m15 during a single hst visit ?",
    "di stefano & rappaport ( 1994 ) predicted a population of @xmath1 200 cvs in 47 tuc , of which @xmath1 50 are dne .",
    "we would expect m15 to have a much higher population of cvs because of its greater core mass and central condensation than 47 tuc .",
    "nevertheless , assuming that m15 has say 50 dne , with a mean outburst recurrence time of 50 days and outburst length of 10 days , then at any given time , one would expect to see @xmath110 dne in outburst .",
    "although dne are brighter in the optical during outburst than in quiescence , their behaviour in the x - ray is harder to predict .",
    "a good summary of the current view of the origin of the x - rays is given by verbunt , wheatley & mattei ( 1999 ) .",
    "for our purposes the crucial point is that in outburst the 2.510  kev flux from the boundary layer largely disappears , and is replaced by a very soft extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) component .",
    "the disappearance of the hard component should drive the x - ray flux down in outburst , but the euv component is so luminous that if its hard energy tail reaches the soft x - ray range , it will dominate the flux there , and lead to a brightening in that range . thus whether the dn brightens or fades depends crucially on the x - ray energy range in question , and to a lesser extent the reddening . given that we know at least one dn ( u gem ; swank et al .",
    "1978 ) whose flux increases even in the 210  kev range , some dne will be brighter in outburst than quiescence in hrc - i , but it is not clear this is true for all of them .",
    "from an observational point of view , we are particularly interested in the dne subclass of cvs because of their frequent outbursts making them easier to detect and classify as definite cvs .",
    "outburst recurrence intervals for dne range typically from 14  120 days or longer , and last @xmath110 days ( see e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "hence , we use our _ chandra _ data here to investigate these fainter sources , in an attempt to reveal m15 s menagerie of cvs , quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries , ( chromospherically ) active binaries and other exotica for the first time .",
    "this work is still in progress : detecting the faint x - ray sources in the core , which is dominated by the flux from ac211 and m15  x-2 , has been  and continues to be  a considerable challenge as we will discuss below .    in section  [ chandra ]",
    "we present our _ chandra _ hrc - i observations , with particular emphasis on how to remove the two luminous sources so as to reveal the faint population within .",
    "in section 3 , we use archival hst imaging to search for optical counterparts to these faint x - ray sources and discuss the implications of these results for the nature of this faint source population .",
    "we obtained three separate observations of m15 with _",
    "chandra s _ hrc - i ( murray et al . 1997 ) of approximately 10  ksec each over a six week period in 2001  jul  aug .",
    "the hrc - i has a @xmath12 field of view .",
    "table  [ tab - obs ] summarizes the details of the observations .",
    "all data were reduced and analyzed using ciao versions 2.0 to 2.3 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath41 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and 4.5 ( 2 - 10 kev ) @xmath42 , and hence we expect @xmath43 discrete background sources within the area enclosed by the half - mass radius ( 1.06@xmath44 ) of m15 .",
    "this provides an upper limit since , even with our psf subtraction , much of the central region of m15 is not probed to this depth .",
    "we conclude that at most one source could be a background object , but given our optical counterpart ids ( see next section ) we would suggest that they are all in fact associated with m15 .",
    "m15 has been a regular target for hst .",
    "studies of m15 s stellar population have been carried out , for example , by ferraro & paresce ( 1993 ) , de marchi & paresce ( 1994 ; 1996 ) guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sosin & king ( 1997 ) , and an intensive photometric study of m15 s pn , k648 , was undertaken by bianchi et al .",
    "( 1995 ; 2001 ) and alves , bond & livio ( 2000 ) .",
    "the hst archives therefore contain many images of m15 obtained at different epochs .    at the distance to m15",
    ", dne would be expected to have quiescent apparent magnitudes of 21 to 24 , with outburst magnitudes ranging from 14 to 21 .",
    "magnetic cvs would have magnitudes similar to quiescent dne ( see warner 1995 ) , while the high mass transfer rate cvs ( the nova - likes and nova remnants ) would be 23 magnitudes brighter .",
    "x - ray transients would be expected to have quiescent apparent magnitudes similar to those of dne , and outburst magnitudes ranging from 13 to 18 .",
    "the deepest hst archival images of m15 go down to 2223 mag .",
    "therefore , most quiescent cvs and x - ray transients would be too faint to detect in such images .",
    "we looked for variables in m15 s core by aligning and subtracting images from different epochs , a technique which highlights stars which vary between the images .",
    "in addition to detecting two previously - identified rr lyrae stars ( ferraro & paresce 1993 ) , we made a first detection of a probable dn in outburst ( fig .",
    "[ fig - dns]a ) , located just 0.3 arcsec from the cluster core ( the optical discovery was reported in charles , clarkson & van zyl 2002 ) .",
    "the object appears in wfpc2 _",
    "u_-band images taken in october 1994 with _",
    "u_=17.60 , but is undetectable in images obtained at other epochs .",
    "therefore its variability range is @xmath465 magnitudes ( the deepest available images have a limiting _ u_@xmath122.5 ) .",
    "this object is revealed here to coincide with one of our faint _",
    "chandra _ x - ray sources ( source a ) ; its luminosity of @xmath47  erg  s@xmath8 is consistent with the brighter cvs identified in other globular clusters .",
    "outbursting dne often start off hard , but this quickly disappears to be replaced by a much softer component ( see e.g. the light curves of ss cyg in outburst in kuulkers et al .",
    "however , we have no way of knowing at what stage in its activity cycle it has been observed .",
    "ne of the cluster core .",
    "the error circles are the _ chandra _ 0.25  arcsec error circle .",
    ", width=302 ]    if this object is indeed a dn or an x - ray transient , it is statistically much more likely to be the former than the latter .",
    "dne outburst recurrence times are weeks to months , while x - ray transients usually recur on much longer timescales , typically tens of years .",
    "the chances of catching an x - ray transient in outburst on the few occasions on which the hst has observed m15 over the last decade are therefore extremely small .",
    "the likelihood that we have a dn rather than an x - ray transient depends also on the relative numbers of these two kinds of object in the core of m15 : we expect cvs to be more numerous than x - ray binaries .",
    "however , we do note that the ( neutron star ) transients in globular clusters appear to have shorter recurrence times between outbursts than those in the field ( e.g. ngc  6440 , pooley et al .",
    "2002b ) . with all of those in clusters having been identified as neutron star systems ( due to the presence of type i x - ray bursts ) , they represent a different population from the soft x - ray transients overall , of which only @xmath125% contain neutron stars , the rest being black - hole candidates ( see e.g. charles 2001 ) . and",
    "since the well - known neutron star sxt aql x-1 outbursts once or twice per year ( e.g. simon 2002 ) , it is still possible that our source a might not turn out to be a dn .",
    "the second probable dn was found in the error circle of a faint _ chandra _ x - ray source 46 arcsec ne of the cluster core ( source c in figure  [ fig - dn+pn ] , well within the cluster half - mass radius ) .",
    "it appears in outburst with _",
    "u_=20.24 in images obtained in october 1994 ( fig .",
    "5b ) , but is completely absent in images at other epochs .",
    "again , as we have no constraint on the light curve there is no way of telling whether we caught it at the peak of its outburst , but this magnitude is consistent with the dn outburst range ( 14 to 21 ) expected for m15 . of course , it is also possible that this object is an x - ray transient , but using the same arguments as above , we believe it is more likely to be a dn .",
    "tuairisg et al . (",
    "2003 ) conducted a ground - based search in 1997 for outbursting dne in m15 but failed to find any .",
    "if these sources ( a and c ) do turn out to be outbursting dne , then these are amongst the few identified thus far in globular clusters  only a handful of erupting dwarf novae in globular clusters have been confirmed ( or suggested as possible outbursting dne ) to date ( e.g. m22 , anderson , cool & king 2003 ; m5 , kaluzny et al . 1999 ; 47  tuc , edmonds et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the two sources discussed above are designated ` probable ' dne , because they were obviously variable in the hst images and showed possible outbursts .",
    "the object discussed in this section is harder to classify , but is the only blue star near the corresponding _ chandra _ x - ray source ( fig .",
    "[ fig - maybeqsxt ] ) .",
    "the source in question is source b in fig .",
    "[ fig - psf ] and the possible counterpart is listed in table  3 . as explained in section  2.2 , we calculated its x - ray luminosity based on several models ",
    "two for a possible qsxt scenario and one for a possible dn scenario ( see table  4 ) .    in all three cases ,",
    "the x - ray source has a luminosity of a few @xmath48 ",
    "@xmath49  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "the candidate optical counterpart has _",
    "u_=21.8 , _",
    "v_=22.54 , and appears to show some variability ( @xmath50 ) ,",
    "although this is uncertain  the object is extremely faint and the apparent variability may simply be noise ( van zyl 2002 ) .",
    "its x - ray luminosity is more consistent with that of a cv , although it is also comparable to the faint end of the distribution of qsxts in gcs ( heinke et al .",
    "2003a ) . with @xmath51 ,",
    "its optical colours are again consistent with those of the dne ss cyg and vw hyi in quiescence ( bailey 1980 ) , similar to that of the ns sxt cen x-4 in quiescence ( mcclintock & remillard 2000 ) , but much bluer than the optically identified qsxt ( x5 ) in 47 tuc ( edmonds et al .",
    "we therefore suggest that source b is more likely another cv rather than a qsxt .",
    "the fourth faint x - ray source we detected has a position consistent ( within the _ chandra _ uncertainties ) with one of the rare globular cluster pne , k648 ( alves , bond & livio 2000 ; hereafter abl ) .",
    "the source was seen to vary by a factor greater than three during the _ chandra _ observations , being observed at @xmath52 and @xmath36erg  s@xmath8 in two ( # 1903 , # 2413 ) but undetected in the third ( # 2412 ) .",
    "we can reject that the source is constant at the @xmath4698% level .",
    "its luminosities are within the range 3@xmath5310@xmath54 to 3@xmath5310@xmath55 erg  s@xmath8 in the 0.41.7  kev band found for 13 x - ray - active pne in the galactic plane using the rosat archive by guerrero , chu & gruendl ( 2000 ) , and for the well - resolved , extended x - ray emission detected with _",
    "chandra _ from the pne bd+303639 ( kastner et al .",
    "2000 ) and ngc  7027 ( kastner , vrtilek & soker 2001 ) .",
    "presuming , therefore , that k648 is the source of the x - rays , it would be both the first globular cluster and the most distant x - ray detected pn .",
    "only four globular cluster pne are known ( see abl and references therein ) , but their very existence implies an unusual evolutionary path .",
    "the lower the mass of a post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) remnant , the longer it takes to heat up to temperatures sufficiently hot to ionize the ejected envelope and produce a visible pn , by which time the ejecta may have dissipated .",
    "recent hst studies of white dwarfs in globular clusters indicate that agb remnant masses are very low ( @xmath56 ; renzini et al .",
    "1996 ; cool , piotto & king 1996 ; richer et al .",
    "agb remnants with these masses have evolutionary timescales that are much longer than pne dissipation timescales ( schnberner 1983 ; vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , we should not expect to observe _ any _ pne within globular clusters !",
    "jacoby et al . (",
    "1997 ) have suggested that the globular cluster pne were therefore formed through close binary interactions .",
    "this certainly applies to the case of k648 since the most massive main sequence stars in m15 should have masses @xmath57  , with agb remnant masses too low to produce pne .",
    "moreover , abl measured an anomalously high mass of @xmath58  for the central star of k648 .",
    "they suggest the most likely origin for this higher mass white dwarf is from mass augmentation of its progenitor star ( i.e. formation of a blue straggler ) due to either mass transfer in or merger of a close binary .",
    "they also note that the morphology of k648 is typical of elliptical pne .",
    "this could be accounted for by either nebular ejection during a common envelope phase , or by enhanced rotation of the agb progenitor ( spun up in a binary system or during a stellar merger ) . in any event ,",
    "a close binary evolutionary stage is indicated .",
    "unfortunately , abl were unable to find further evidence that the central star is currently a close binary , as no variability was seen over their 7-day hst / wfpc2 observing campaign .    in principle",
    "the x - ray emission from k648 might arise from either diffuse thermal emission from a large cavity inside the nebula , or point - like emission from the pn nucleus ( pnn ; see soker & kastner 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "however , given its short - term variability ( within 19 days ) , emission from the compact pnn is much more likely .",
    "soker & kastner ( 2002 ) predict that 2030% of elliptical pne probably have magnetically active late - type companions in binary systems with @xmath59and x - ray luminosities of @xmath60  erg  s@xmath8 . indeed , the most likely scenario , in view of k648 s x - ray variability , is some sort of binary system , where accretion either directly or indirectly is reponsible ( j. kastner , priv .",
    "we have identified four faint x - ray sources in the globular cluster m15 using _",
    "chandra_. three of these are probable dne ( although the possibility that source b is a qsxt can not be ruled out ) and the fourth is associated with the planetary nebula k648 .",
    "one of the dne ( source a ) was initially discovered by applying image subtraction to wfpc2 images of the core of m15 ( charles et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this study we reported on the detection of its x - ray emission .",
    "the qsxt / dn ( source b ) and the other dn ( source c ) were first detected using wavdetect in the _ chandra _ images and then associated with optical counterparts in hst images , which allowed us to speculate on their nature .",
    "we have also discovered that the pn k648 in m15 ( source d ) is a variable x - ray source , perhaps indicating a binary nature for the planetary nebula nucleus .",
    "if k648 is indeed the source of the x - rays , it is both the first globular cluster and the most distant x - ray detected planetary nebula .",
    "sources a , b and c ( both dne and the qsxt / dn ) had x - ray luminosities ranging from @xmath61 in the 0.57  kev range during these _ chandra _ observations . converting the luminosities to the 0.52.5  kev range , one gets a minimum luminosity of @xmath62 and a maximum of @xmath63  these luminosities place these sources at the bright end of the galactic systems studied by verbunt et al .",
    "this implies that the majority of dne in m15 remain to be discovered by more sensitive observations . in order to identify optical counterparts of more",
