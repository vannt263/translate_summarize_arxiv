    "recently rapid development of magneto electronics intensified the researches on the ferromagnetic materials that are suitable for the spin injection into a semiconductor@xcite .",
    "one of the promising classes of materials are the half ",
    "metallic ferrimagnets , i.e. , compounds for which only one spin channel presents a gap at the fermi level , while the other has a metallic character , leading to 100% carrier spin - polarization at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the half  metallic ferromagnetism ( hmf ) was discovered by de groot _",
    "et al . _ in 1983 when studying the band structure of semi heusler compound nimnsb @xcite .",
    "have proposed that also the full - heusler alloys compounds of the type co@xmath0mnz , where z stands for si and ge , are half - metals @xcite . since then",
    "many others have been predicted on the basis of ground state calculations , such as magnetic oxides ( cro@xmath0 and fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ) , colossal magnetoresistance materials ( sr@xmath0femoo@xmath4 and la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "finally the diluted magnetic semiconductors ( ga@xmath7mn@xmath8as ) and mnas and cras in the zincblende crystal structure have attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "heusler alloys have been particularly interesting systems because they exhibit much higher ferromagnetic curie temperature than other half  metallic materials @xcite . among the other properties useful for the applications are the crystal structure and lattice matching compatible with zinc - blende semiconductors used industrially @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath0val received much experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "the neutron diffraction experiment by itoh et al .",
    "@xcite revealed the ferrimagnetic ordering in this compound with a mn magnetic moment of @xmath9 and a v moment of @xmath10 .",
    "_ studied the magnetic and structural properties of mn@xmath0v@xmath11al@xmath7 as a function of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the structure preserved the l2@xmath13-type phase for @xmath14 with linearly varying saturation moment .",
    "for @xmath15 a structural transformation from l2@xmath13-phase to a disordered b2-type phase has been detected .",
    "recently jiang _",
    "_ e__t al . examined the magnetic structure of mn@xmath0val by x - ray diffraction and magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "they found that mn@xmath0val was nearly half - metallic with the total magnetic moment of 1.94@xmath16 at 5 k. the loss of half - metallic character was attributed to the small amount of disorder in v and al sublattices .",
    "the electronic structure of mn@xmath0val has been studied for the first time by ishida _",
    "the authors used local - density approximation ( lda ) to the density functional theory and showed that ground state of mn@xmath0val was close to half - metallicity . recently a detailed theoretical study of the magnetism of mn@xmath0val was reported by weht and pickett @xcite who used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange correlation potential and have shown that mn@xmath0val is a half - metallic ferrimagnet with the atomic moments of 1.5@xmath16 and -0.9@xmath16 for mn and v atoms respectively , in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "the fermi level was found to lie in the minority spin band . in 2005",
    "aioglu _ _ e__t al . studied the exchange interaction and curie temperature in the mn@xmath0vz ( z = al , ge ) half  metallic compounds and showed that the antiferrimagnetic coupling between the v and mn atoms stabilizes the ferromagnetic alignment of the mn spin moments @xcite .",
    "half - metallic ferrimagnetic materials , like femnsb or the mn@xmath0vz compounds , are much more desirable than their ferromagnetic counterparts in magnetoelectronics applications .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that the small value of the total magnetic moment in these systems provides additional advantageous .",
    "for example they do not give rise to strong stray fields in devices or are less affected by the external magnetic fields .    the ideal case for",
    "applications would be a half - metallic antiferromagnet like crmnsb .",
    "it is a special antiferromagnet in the sense that the majority spin and minority spin densities of states are not identical , as for common antiferromagnets and the material is better described as a fully compensated ferrimagnet , having a magnetic moment that is , due to the half - metallic character , precisely equal to zero .",
    "such a half - metallic antiferromagnet would be a very interesting magnetoelectronic material since it would be a perfectly stable spin - polarized electrode in a junction device . and",
    "moreover if used as a tip in a spin - polarized stm , it would not give rise to stray flux , and hence would not distort the domain structure of the soft - magnetic systems to be studied .",
    "unfortunately , crmnsb does not crystallize in the ordered c1@xmath17 crystal structure adopted by the half - heusler alloys .",
    "however , these results show that such an important magnetoelectronic material could exist .",
    "van leuken and de groot have recently suggested a possible route towards a half - metallic antiferromagnet starting from the semiconducting c1@xmath17-type compound fevsb @xcite .",
    "it is isoelectronic with the non - existing half - metallic antiferromagnet crmnsb . a 12.5 % substitution of mn for v , and ( in order to keep the system isoelectronic , in for sb )",
    "was predicted to already yield half - metallic ferrimagnetism , with local mn moments of about 2.3 @xmath16 and a band gap of about 0.35 ev .    in the present paper ,",
    "we systematically study the electronic and magnetic structure of v  based full heusler alloys mn@xmath0vz ( z = al , ga , in , si , ge , and sn ) to search for new half - metallic ferrimagnetic candidates and search for way to decrease their spin - moment in order to reach the ideal case of the half - metallic compensated ferrimagnet . among the systems studied mn@xmath0vz ( z = al , ga , in and sn ) are predicted to be nearly half - metallic at theoretical equilibrium lattice constants .",
    "we demonstrate that half - metallicity can be achieved in mn@xmath0vz ( z = al , se , ge , sn ) by expanding the lattice parameter by a few percent and can be maintained for a small range of lattice constants .",
    "finally the effect of disorder , and more specifically the intermixing of v and @xmath18 atoms , on the half - metallicity and spin polarization of the mn@xmath0val is discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present the calculational approach .",
    "section [ sec4 ] contains the results and the discussion on the total energy calculations and section [ sec5 ] is devoted to effect of disorder . finally in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we summarise and conclude .",
    "full heusler compounds crystallize in the @xmath19type structure ( see figure  [ fig_lattice ] ) .",
    "the lattice consists of four interpenetrating fcc sublattices and is characterized by the formula x@xmath0yz . in the compounds under study ,",
    "mn atoms occupy the x sites in contrast to the majority of the heusler alloys for which mn atom usually enters as the y element .",
    "vanadium atoms occupy the y sites while the z site corresponds to the @xmath18 element ( in our case al , ga , in , si , ge or sn ) .     structure adapted by the full heusler compounds .",
    "the lattice consists of four interpenetrating fcc sublattices with the positions @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the mn and @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the v and _ sp _ ( z ) atoms , respectively . ]",
    "the electronic structure calculations are performed using the full  potential nonorthogonal local ",
    "orbital minimum  basis band structure scheme ( fplo ) @xcite .",
    "we use the scalar relativistic formulation and thus the spin - orbit coupling is not taken into account .",
    "the exchange  correlation potential is chosen in the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent potentials were calculated on a @xmath24 * k*-mesh in the brillouin zone , which correspond to 256 k points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the set of valance orbitals in the fplo calculations were selected as 3s , 3p , 4s , 4p , 3d for mn , ga , ge and v , 4s , 4p , 5s , 5p , 4d for in and sn and 2s , 2p , 3s , 3p , 3d for al and si . all lower states were treated as core states .    disorder in mn@xmath0v@xmath7al@xmath11 was introduced within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) implemented in fplo code @xcite .",
    "the first task , which we undertook , was to calculate how the total energy changes with the lattice constant and thus to find the theoretical equilibrium lattice parameter .",
    "we performed calculations both for the non - magnetic and the ferrimagnetic cases and we summarize our results in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "there is a clear difference when the @xmath18 atom belong to the iiib column of the periodic table ( al , ga or in ) having three valence electrons with respect to the case of a ivb column @xmath18 element ( si , ge or sn ) with four valence electrons . for mn@xmath0val(ga or in)it is clear that the ferrimagnetic state is the most stable one and the stability ( relative energy difference between the fm and pm curves ) increases as the @xmath18 element is heavier reaching a value of around 0.15 ev for mn@xmath0vin at the equilibrium lattice constant . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we have gathered the equilibrium lattice constants , the difference in energy between the fm and pm states and the atom - resolved and total spin moments .",
    "interestingly mn@xmath0val has a similar lattice constant to mn@xmath0vga and one has to go to mn@xmath0vin to see an important difference in the calculated equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "note also that the total spin moments are not integers and thus the system is not half - metallic at the equilibrium lattice constants .",
    ".the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters ( in ferrimagnetic state ) , the energy difference @xmath25 between the ferrimagnetic and non - magnetic state at the equilibrium lattice constant , and the atom - resolved spin magnetic moments in @xmath16 for the mn@xmath0vz ( z = al , ga , in , si , ge , sn ) compounds .",
    "last column is the total spin magnetic moment in the primitive cell .",
    "note that for si and ge compounds we could not converge a ferrimagnetic calculation at the equilibrium lattice constant ( see text ) . )",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    in table  [ table2 ] we have gathered the half - metallic parameters and the spin moments for four of the compounds under study .",
    "we provide for each compound the smallest and largest lattice constant for which half - metallicity is present . of course the heavier the system the largest the lattice parameters .",
    "we also note that the range of paramters for which half - metallicity appears is doubled in the case of mn@xmath0val(si ) with respect to mn@xmath0vge and even tripled with respect to mn@xmath0vsn .",
    "the lighter the elements , the smaller the coulomb respulsion and this leads to larger gaps covering a larger area of lattice constants .",
    "expansion of the lattice leads in all cases to a small rearrangement of the charge and the absolute values of the spin moments of all atoms increase . especially in the case where the @xmath18 belongs to the ivb column",
    "the spin moment of v is comparable to the spin moment of each mn atom .",
    "conlcuding we should note that half - metallicity is feasible in these compounds depending on the lattice parameter adopted and thus the choice of the proper substrate in experiments is of primordial importance to get the highest possible spin - polarization in experiments .",
    "the effect of mixing the @xmath18 atom has been already extensively studied for the full - heusler alloys and especially in reference @xcite it was shown that mixing the al and ge atoms does not destroy the gap . on the contrary the mn@xmath0v[al@xmath8ge@xmath7 ] remains half - metallic for any concentration of al and ge atoms .",
    "this implies that it also shows the slater - pauling behaviour and the total spin moment scales following the rule @xmath27 . in our study",
    "we will seek the influence of mixing now the lower - valent transition metal atom ( v ) and the @xmath18 atom .",
    "we took as prototypes mn@xmath0val and mn@xmath0vsi at such a lattice constant that the fermi level lies in the middle of the gap , and then studied the families mn@xmath0v@xmath7al@xmath11 and mn@xmath0v@xmath7si@xmath11 for @xmath28 $ ] with a step of 0.05 .",
    "v@xmath7al@xmath11 ( left pannel ) and mn@xmath0v@xmath7si@xmath11 ( right pannel ) compounds . ]    in figure  [ fig4 ] we have gathered the spin - resolved dos for all cases under study . the left pannel contains the resutls for the al - based compounds .",
    "we note that for @xmath29 we have a half - metallic compound as already stated .",
    "when we have a surplus of al atoms ( @xmath12=0.1 and 0.2 ) then the gap shrinks to almost zero but the fermi level continues to fall within it .",
    "an excess of v atoms ( @xmath12=-0.1 and -0.2 ) has a similar effect .",
    "the physics is even clearer when we look at figure  [ fig5 ] where we represent the variation of the spin moments and spin polarisation with the concentration .",
    "when we are away from @xmath12=0 the system keeps a high degree of spin - polarisation of about -90% , which means that almost all electrons ( @xmath3095% ) are of spin - down character .",
    "the spin - magnetic moment of the mn atom is not influenced by the disorder and remains almost constant for all values of @xmath12 .",
    "the spin moment of al is almost negligible and has no real effect on the total spin moment .",
    "it is the spin moment of v which changes but as we can see from the total spin moment in the cell , it follows the slater - pauling behaviour . for @xmath12=-0.2",
    "we have the mn@xmath0v@xmath31al@xmath32 compound which has in average 22.4 electrons per unit cell and thus the total spin moment should be -1.6 @xmath16 for the half - metallic case . for @xmath12=0.2 ,",
    "the compound mn@xmath0v@xmath32al@xmath31 has in average 21.6 valence electrons and thus half - metallicity corresponds to -2.4 @xmath16 .",
    "these values coincide with the calculated one presented in figure [ fig5 ] .     for the mn@xmath0v@xmath7al@xmath11 and mn@xmath0v@xmath7si@xmath11 compounds . ]    in the case of the mn@xmath0v@xmath7si@xmath11 compounds the effect of disorder is much larger and as we can see from figure  [ fig5 ] away from the half - metallicity the spin polarization is as low as -80% and thus @xmath3090% of electrons at the fermi level are of spin - down character .",
    "but the system remains almost half - metallic as we can conclude by studying the variation of the total spin moment .",
    "the values @xmath12=-0.2 and @xmath12=0.2 correspond to 23.2 and 22.8 total valence electrons in the cell in average , respectively .",
    "the calculated total spin moments are about 0.8 and 1.2 @xmath16 as expected from the slater - pauling curve for the half - metallic systems . thus although disorder leads to a decrease of the spin - polarization , a small amount of disorder keeps an almost half - metallic character in the system .",
    "the case of mn@xmath0v@xmath7si@xmath11 compounds is a very intesting one .",
    "decreasing slightly the concentration in si keeps a really high spin - polarization and in the mean time the total spin - moment in the cell decreases reaching a value of less than 1 @xmath16 while the individual spin moments of v and mn atoms stay really high . to this respect the case of mn@xmath0v@xmath31si@xmath32 is very near to what we can call an ideal half - metallic compensated ferrimagnet .",
    "moreover even in the ideal case , half - metallicity would be lost in the case of surfaces or interfaces @xcite making such a system even more attractive and a possible candidate for spintronic devices .",
    "we have studied the possibility of appearance of half - metallicity in the case of the full - heusler compounds mn@xmath0vz where z is an @xmath18 atom belonging to the iiib or ivb column of the periodic table .",
    "these compound show ferrimagnetism with the v and z spin moments being antiparallel to the mn ones .",
    "firstly we performed total - energy calculations for both the non - magnetic and ferrimagnetic configurations to find the stable magnetic configuration and the equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "we found that when z is al , ga , in and sn the ferrimagnetic is stable with respect to the non - magnetic state , while for the si and ge compounds at the equilibrium lattice constant we could converge only the non - magnetic solution . a small expansion of the lattice leads to the emergence of ferrimagnetism also in these compounds .",
    "although all compounds are not half - metallic at their equilibrium lattice constant , small expansion of the lattice pushes the fermi level within the gap which is now situated in the spin - up band contrary to all other full - heusler alloys . the total spin moment is -2 @xmath16 for the mn@xmath0val(ga or in ) compounds which have 22 valence electrons per unit cell and -1 @xmath16 for the mn@xmath0vsi(ge or sn ) compounds with 23 valence electrons .",
    "thus theses compounds follow the slater - pauling behaviour and the `` rule of 24 '' @xcite .",
    "the lighter the element and the smaller the number of valence electrons , the wider is the gap and the more stable is the half - metallicity with respect to the variation of the lattice constant .",
    "finally we examined in the case of the half - metallic mn@xmath0val and mn@xmath0vsi compounds the effect of intermixing v with the al or si atoms .",
    "we found that a small degree of disorder decreases the spin - polarization at the fermi level from its ideal -100% value but since this effect is only local , the resulting alloys still show an almost half - metallic behaviour .",
    "a small degree of substitution of v atom for si ones in mn@xmath0vsi keeps a high degree of spin - polarization and as shown by the total spin moment in the cell the compound stays almost half - metallic . in the mean time the total spin moment considerably decreases and the alloy is very near to what we can call an ideal half - metallic compensated ferrimagnet which has several advantages for realistic spintronic applications .",
    "our work urges experimentalists to grow new half - metallic alloys on suitable substrates to get new candidates for spintronic applications .",
