    "the search for quantum spin liquid states in frustrated magnets can be traced back at least as far as the early suggestion of a resonating valence bond state in the triangular lattice heisenberg model@xcite .",
    "almost 15 years later , the suggestion of such a state in the undoped high-@xmath5 cuprates@xcite set off an explosion of interest in two - dimensional spin liquids ( i.e.  mott insulators at half - filling with _ no _ broken symmetries ) .",
    "frustrated heisenberg models on the square , triangular and kagom lattices have all received significant attention as candidate systems for quantum disordered ground states . while there has been comparatively little theoretical work on quantum spin liquids in three - dimensional frustrated magnets , materials with magnetic ions on the pyrochlore lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pyro ] ) may be good candidates for spin liquids and other exotic states .",
    "to give one example , recent neutron scattering experiments on @xmath6 , a @xmath7 pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnet , suggest a nontrivial disordered state@xcite above a transition to nel order accompanied by a lattice distortion@xcite at 12.5 k.    meanwhile , much work has been devoted to understanding the properties of possible spin liquid states , independent of their existence in particular microscopic models .",
    "most of the proposed spin liquid states support deconfined @xmath8 spinons ; such states are fractionalized in that some of the elementary excitations carry quantum numbers that are fractions of those allowed in a finite - size system .",
    "fractionalized states can be precisely characterized by their _",
    "_ topological order__@xcite , which in the simplest scenario is associated with the topological sectors of an emergent , deconfining @xmath9 gauge field@xcite .",
    "the `` vison , '' a gapped vortex - like excitation that carries the @xmath9 flux@xcite , must also be present .",
    "while topological order does not require a liquid ground state and can coexist with conventional long - range order , we believe it is probably common in spin liquids and hence in some of the nearby ordered states . very recently , many of these ideas have been put on firmer ground by the emergence of several microscopic models supporting stable fractionalized phases in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "despite these recent theoretical successes , an unambiguous experimental realization of these ideas is still lacking . indeed , spin liquid states seem rather rare ; is topological order rare as well ? for @xmath9-fractionalized states",
    "this question is difficult to answer , because the gapped visons have no effect on easily measurable low - energy properties .",
    "clever proposals have been made@xcite and carried out@xcite to directly detect topological order in the cuprates ( with negative results thus far ) , but these experiments are difficult and rely on properties of the phases proximate to a topologically ordered state . @xmath9",
    "topological order is difficult enough to observe that it is impossible to say at present how rare or common it is .",
    "fortunately it may be possible to shed new light on the experimental situation . in this paper , we present two models of _ three - dimensional _ @xmath8 frustrated magnets , one on the pyrochlore lattice , the other on a related network of corner - sharing octahedra ( the links of the cubic lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubic - octahedra ] ) . both of these models exhibit a novel fractionalized phase , the @xmath1 spin liquid .",
    "this state has an emergent @xmath1 gauge structure that gives rise to several remarkable properties : there is a _",
    "`` artificial photon '' excitation , a gapped spinon carrying `` electric '' gauge charge , a gapped `` magnetic '' monopole , an emergent @xmath10 `` coulomb '' potential between pairs of spinons and monopoles , and novel @xmath1 topological order .",
    "if this phase exists in a real material , the gapless photon should have important implications for low - energy thermodynamics , transport and spectroscopy ; therefore @xmath1 fractionalization may be easier to find in experiments .",
    "such states , thus far realized in large-@xmath11 spin models@xcite and bosonic hubbard - type models@xcite , arise as the deconfined or coulomb phase of compact @xmath1 lattice gauge theory .",
    "while most work on spin liquids has focused on @xmath12 , motivated by the cuprates and the conventional wisdom that quantum fluctuations are more effective at destroying long range order in low dimensions , the @xmath1 spin liquid _ only _ occurs in @xmath13 ; for @xmath12 the coulomb phase of compact @xmath1 gauge theory ( with gapped matter ) is always unstable due to instanton effects@xcite .",
    "both models are of intrinsic interest as examples of tractable but nontrivial frustrated magnets .",
    "the pyrochlore model is particularly appealing due to its simplicity : its derivation begins with the nearest - neighbor @xmath8 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "taking the limit of large easy - axis exchange anisotropy @xmath14 simplifies the problem by breaking the spectrum into extensively degenerate manifolds with large separations of @xmath15 .",
    "it is then possible to write an effective hamiltonian describing the splitting of the low - energy manifold , using standard techniques of degenerate perturbation theory in @xmath16 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian _ has _ a @xmath1 gauge structure , which forms the foundation for our subsequent analysis@xcite .",
    "another point of view , equivalent at the level of perturbation theory but perhaps with broader implications in more general scenarios , is that the low - energy sector of the model is _ unitarily equivalent _ to a @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "it is not obvious how to treat the resulting model analytically , but upon addition of an extra six - site interaction term it can be tuned to a soluble point where it is possible to write an exact ground state wavefunction with no further approximations .",
    "the models can be reinterpreted as quantum dimer models ( qdms ) , and the extra term as the analog of the rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) potential in the square lattice qdm@xcite . as will be explained in detail below ,",
    "the properties of the soluble point allow us to locate the @xmath1 spin liquid adjacent to it .",
    "since this state is stable to _ all _ zero - temperature perturbations , it persists over a finite extent of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] ) .",
    "furthermore , stability to large but finite @xmath17 implies that the @xmath1 gauge structure persists in the absence of microscopic local symmetries and is truly emergent . on the purely theoretical side , we believe these models give the first examples of @xmath1 gauge theories that have a deconfining phase even in the limit of infinitely strong bare coupling . the first such @xmath9 gauge theory was discovered only recently by moessner and sondhi@xcite .",

    "this is a higher - dimensional generalization of the effective picture of the square lattice qdm in terms of a coarse - grained height field @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 spin liquid has power - law correlations with nontrivial angular dependence , novel @xmath1 topological order , and supports gapped @xmath3 spinons , a gapped topological point defect ( the `` magnetic '' monopole ) and a gapless @xmath4 collective mode corresponding to the photon of the gauge theory .",
    "the latter excitation makes an additive @xmath21 contribution to the low - temperature specific heat , and should affect various other low - energy properties of @xmath1-fractionalized phases ( either the @xmath1 spin liquid , or phases with coexisting conventional and topological order ) .",

    "all of the statements in this and the following section can be generalized simply to the pyrochlore case ; this is summarized in section [ sec : pyro - mappings ] below .",

    "* time reversal : since spin operators obey @xmath433 under time - reversal , we have : @xmath429 , @xmath434 and @xmath435 . for consistency with the electric field transformation law , @xmath436 . in the action",
    "the latter relation continues to hold , as long as we also send @xmath437 .",
    "furthermore , the temporal component of the dual vector potential transforms as @xmath438 . note that the situation here is the reverse of that in real electromagnetism , where @xmath439 changes sign under time reversal and @xmath257 is invariant .    these symmetries are all present in analogous forms in the diamond lattice gauge theory .",
    "there is also an additional global symmetry , which exchanges the two sublattices of up- and down - pointing sites .",
    "we consider the classical dimer model on the square lattice at infinite temperature , with two dimers touching every site .",
    "this is the @xmath217 analog of the rk point of our cubic model .",
    "we work in the electric field language , where @xmath440 with @xmath441 , and @xmath442 .",
    "consider an @xmath443 system ( @xmath260 even ) with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath444,j } = e_{{\\bf r}j}$ ] , where @xmath445 .",
    "the zero - flux sector is specified by the condition : @xmath446 we will show that any two states in this sector are connected by a sequence of ring exchange moves on single square plaquettes .    the key step is to go to a height representation on the dual lattice with sites at the plaquette centers @xmath447 .",
    "we define : @xmath448,y } \\\\",
    "h({\\sf r } + { \\bf y } ) - h({\\sf r } ) & = & 2",
    "e_{[{\\sf r } + ( { \\bf y } - { \\bf x})/2],x } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the content of this definition is that the height increases / decreases by one if we cross a link of the direct lattice with electric field pointing to the right / left .",
    "if we fix the value of the height on one site of the dual lattice these definitions determine it uniquely everywhere .",
    "the height is well - defined because the electric field has zero divergence , and can consistently be taken to have periodic boundary conditions because we are in the zero - flux sector .",
    "a flippable plaquette has a height either above or below all of its four neighbors , depending on its orientation . therefore , in a given configuration , the plaquettes with minimum and maximum height will always be flippable , and every configuration has at least two flippable plaquettes .",
    "there are also two states with every plaquette flippable ; up to overall shifts of the height these have @xmath449 these two configurations are connected by single ring moves , since we can flip all the maximum height plaquettes in one to go to the other .    to complete the proof , we label configurations by @xmath450 .",
    "this clearly takes on the minimum possible value of unity in only the two maximally flippable states .",
    "suppose we are in some other state with @xmath451 .",
    "then we can flip plaquettes of maximum height until @xmath452 is reduced by 1 .",
    "this procedure can be repeated until @xmath453 and we reach one of the maximally flippable states .",
    "we have thus shown that any two states are connected by a sequence of single ring moves , because the maximally flippable states are connected to all states and to each other .",
    "the presence of such a gauge structure and the possibility of a coulomb phase has been realized independently by moessner , for a pyrochlore ising antiferromagnet in a weak transverse field .",
    "( r. moessner , private communication . )                                                another point of potential interest in this regard is that the pyrochlore ising antiferromagnet with a small _ ferromagnetic _ transverse exchange or small transverse field ( see ref .  ) is likely to have a @xmath1 spin liquid phase ; the lowest - order splitting of the low - energy manifold is identical to that in our model .",
    "these models have no sign problem and should also be accessible to numerical work ."
