    "in quantum field theory on the kruskal spacetime , one way to arrive at the thermal effects is through the observation that the spacetime has two exterior regions separated by a bifurcate killing horizon .",
    "a  free scalar field on the kruskal spacetime has a vacuum state , known as the  vacuum  @xcite , that is invariant under all the continuous isometries of the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this state is pure , but the expectation values of operators with support in _",
    "one _ exterior region are thermal in the hawking temperature  @xcite .",
    "similar observations hold for field theory on the nonextremal ( 2 + 1)-dimensional  ( btz ) black hole , both with and without spin  @xcite , and also for conformal field theory on the conformal boundary of the btz hole  @xcite .    in all these cases",
    "one has a vacuum state that knows about the global geometry of the spacetime , in particular about the fact that the spacetime has two exterior regions .",
    "suppose now that we modify the spacetime in some ` reasonable ' fashion so that one exterior region remains as it is , and all the modification takes place behind the killing horizons of this exterior region .",
    "suppose further that the modified spacetime admits a vacuum state that is , in some reasonable sense , a  type vacuum .",
    "can we then , by probing the new vacuum in the unmodified exterior region , discover that something has happened to the spacetime behind the horizons ?",
    "in particular , as the new spacetime is still a black ( and white ) hole , does the new vacuum exhibit thermality , and if so , at what temperature ? in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case , the analogous questions can also be raised for conformal field theory on the conformal boundary .",
    "these lectures address the above questions for a particular modification of the kruskal manifold and the spinless btz hole : we modify the spacetimes by a quotient construction that identifies the two exterior regions with each other . for kruskal ,",
    "the resulting spacetime is referred to as the @xmath0 geon @xcite , and for btz , as the @xmath1 geon  @xcite .",
    "these spacetimes are black ( and white ) holes , and their only singularities are those inherited from the singularities of the two - exterior holes .    on the @xmath0 geon , a free scalar field has a vacuum induced from the  vacuum on kruskal .",
    "the vacuum is not fully thermal for static exterior observers , but it appears thermal when probed with operators that do not see certain types of correlations , such as in particular operators with support at asymptotically late times , and the apparent temperature is then the usual hawking temperature .",
    "however , a  naive application of euclidean - signature path - integral methods via saddle - point methods yields for the geon only half of the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the schwarzschild hole with the same mass .",
    "the situation on the conformal boundary of the @xmath1 geon is analogous .",
    "the quotient construction from the conformal boundary of  space induces on the boundary of the geon a  type vacuum that is not fully thermal , but it appears thermal when probed with operators that do not see certain types of correlations , and the apparent temperature is then the usual hawking temperature of the btz hole .",
    "the properties of the boundary vacuum turn out to reflect in a surprisingly close fashion the geometry of the geon spacetime .",
    "this can be interpreted as support for the holographic hypothesis @xcite , according to which physics in the bulk of a spacetime should be retrievable from physics on the boundary of the spacetime .",
    "it further suggests that single - exterior black holes can serve as a test bed for the versions of the holographic hypothesis that arise in string theory for asymptotically   spacetimes via the maldacena duality conjectures  @xcite .",
    "the material is based on joint work @xcite with don marolf , whom i would like to thank for a truly delightful collaboration .",
    "i  would also like to thank the organizers of the polanica winter school for the opportunity to present the work in a most pleasant and inspiring atmosphere .",
    "recall that the metric on the kruskal manifold @xmath2 reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the metric on the unit two - sphere , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is determined as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 by @xmath10 the coordinates are global , apart from the elementary singularities of the spherical coordinates .",

    ", we take here the field to be massless .",
    "the situation with a massive field is qualitatively similar  @xcite .",
    "recall that the  vacuum @xmath54 of a massless scalar field on the kruskal manifold @xmath2 can be characterized by its positive frequency properties along the affine parameters of the horizon generators @xcite , by the complex analytic properties of the feynman propagator upon analytic continuation to @xmath35 @xcite , or by the invariance under the continuous isometries of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "@xmath54  is regular everywhere on @xmath55 , but it is not annihilated by the annihilation operators associated with the future timelike killing vectors in the exterior regions : a static observer in an exterior region sees @xmath54 as an excited state .",
    "we have the expansion @xmath56 where the boulware vacuum @xmath57 is the vacuum with respect to the timelike killing vectors in the exterior regions , @xmath58 are the creation operators with respect to this killing vector in the right - hand - side exterior region , and @xmath59 are the creation operators with respect to this killing vector in the left - hand - side exterior region",
    ".    @xmath54  thus contains boulware excitations in correlated pairs , such that one member of the pair has support in the right - hand - side exterior and the other member in the left - hand - side exterior .",
    "an operator with support in ( say ) the right - hand - side exterior does not couple to the left - hand - side excitations , and the expectation values of such operators in @xmath54 thus look like expectation values in a mixed state . from the detailed form of the expansion coefficients @xmath60 ( which we do not write out here ) it is seen that this mixed state is thermal , and it has at infinity the hawking temperature @xmath61 .",
    "now , through the quotient construction from @xmath2 to @xmath62 , @xmath54 induces on @xmath62 a  type vacuum , which we denote by  @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath63  has the expansion @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the boulware vacuum in the single exterior region and @xmath66 are the creation operators of boulware particles in the exterior region .",
    "the indices @xmath67 and @xmath68 now label a complete set of positive frequency boulware modes in the single exterior region .",
    "we see from ( [ hhvacgeon - expansion ] ) that @xmath63 contains boulware excitations in correlated pairs , but the crucial point is that both members of each pair have support in the single exterior region",
    ". consequently , the expectation values of arbitrary operators in the exterior region are not thermal . however , for operators that do not contain couplings between modes with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the expectation values turn out to be thermal , with the hawking temperature @xmath61 .",
    "one class of operators for which this is the case are operators with , roughly speaking , support at asymptotically late ( or early ) times : the reason is that an excitation with support at asymptotically late exterior times is correlated with one with support at asymptotically early exterior times .",
    "note that `` early '' and `` late '' here mean compared with the distinguished exterior spacelike hypersurface mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : kruskal - and - geon ] ( in fig .  [ fig : rpthree ] , the one at @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , for a late - time observer in the exterior region of @xmath62 , the state @xmath63 is indistinguishable from the state @xmath54 on  @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion can also be reached by analyzing the response of a monopole particle detector , or from an emission - absorption analysis analogous to that performed for @xmath54 in  @xcite , provided certain technical assumptions about the falloff of the two - point functions in @xmath63 hold  @xcite .",
    "as explained above , for a late - time exterior observer in @xmath62 the state @xmath63 is indistinguishable from the state @xmath54 on  @xmath2 .",
    "the late - time observer can therefore promote the classical first law of black hole mechanics @xcite into a first law of black hole thermodynamics exactly as for the kruskal black hole  @xcite .",
    "the observer thus finds for the thermodynamic late time entropy of the geon the usual kruskal value  @xmath71 , which is one quarter of the area of the geon black hole horizon at late times .",
    "if one views the geon as a dynamical black - hole spacetime , with the asymptotic far - future horizon area  @xmath72 , this is the result one might have expected on physical grounds .    on the other hand , the area - entropy relation for the geon",
    "is made subtle by the fact that the horizon area is not constant along the horizon .",
    "away from the intersection of the past and future horizons , the horizon duly has topology @xmath50 and area @xmath72 , just as in kruskal .",
    "the critical surface at the intersection of the past and future horizons , however , has topology @xmath1 and area  @xmath73 . as it is precisely this critical surface that belongs to both the lorentzian and riemannian sections of the complexified manifold , and constitutes the horizon of the riemannian section",
    ", one may expect that methods utilizing the riemannian section of the complexified manifold @xcite produce for the geon entropy the value  @xmath74 , which is one quarter of the critical surface area , and only half of the kruskal entropy .",
    "this indeed is the case , provided the surface terms in the riemannian geon action are handled in a way suggested by the quotient construction from @xmath35 to @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "there are several possible physical interpretations for this disagreement between the lorentzian and riemannian results for the entropy . at one extreme",
    ", it could be that the path - integral framework is simply inapplicable to the geon , for reasons having to do with the absence of certain globally - defined symmetries .",
    "for instance , despite the fact that the exterior region of @xmath62 is static , the restriction of @xmath63 to this region is not .",
    "also , the asymptotic region of @xmath41 does not have a globally - defined killing field , and the homotopy group of any neighborhood of infinity in @xmath41 is @xmath75 as opposed to the trivial group .",
    "it may well be that such an asymptotic structure does not satisfy the boundary conditions that should be imposed in the path integral for the quantum gravitational partition function .    at another extreme , it could be that the path - integral framework is applicable to the geon , and our way of applying it is correct , but the resulting entropy is physically distinct from the subjective thermodynamic entropy associated with the late - time exterior observer .",
    "if this is the case , the physical interpretation of the path - integral entropy might be in the quantum statistics in the whole exterior region , and one might anticipate this entropy to arise from tracing over degrees of freedom that are in some sense unobservable",
    ". it would thus be interesting to see see whether any state - counting calculation for the geon entropy would produce agreement with the path - integral result .",
    "we now turn to 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions . in this section",
    "we review how the spinless nonextremal btz hole and the @xmath1 geon arise as quotient spaces of the three - dimensional  space , and how this quotient construction can be extended to the conformal boundaries .",
    "recall that the three - dimensional  space ( @xmath76 ) can be defined as the hyperboloid @xmath77 in @xmath78 with the metric @xmath79 we have here normalized the gaussian curvature of @xmath76 to  @xmath80 .",

    "one would certainly not expect a free conformal scalar field on the boundary of a spacetime to carry all the information about the spacetime geometry .",
    "however , for certain spacetimes related to  space , a more precise version of the holographic hypothesis has emerged in string theory in the form of the maldacena duality conjectures  @xcite . in particular , the 10-dimensional spacetime @xmath146 , with a flat metric on the @xmath147 and a round metric on the  @xmath148 , is a classical solution to string theory , and the duality conjectures relate string theory on this spacetime to a certain conformal nonlinear sigma - model on the conformal boundary of the @xmath93 component . upon quotienting from @xmath93 to the ( in general spinning ) btz hole , the conformal field theory on the boundary ends in a thermal state analogous to our @xmath130 , but with an energy expectation value that in the high temperature limit is not merely proportional to but in fact equal to the adm mass of the hole  @xcite .",
    "this result can be considered a strong piece of evidence for the duality conjectures .",
    "it would now be of obvious interest to adapt our free scalar field analysis on the boundary of the @xmath1 geon to a string theoretic context in which the duality conjectures would apply .",
    "one would expect the boundary state again to appear thermal in the hawking temperature under some restricted set of observations .",
    "the crucial question for the the holographic hypothesis is how the correlations in the boundary state might reflect the geometry of the spacetime . as a preliminary step in this direction ,",
    "a toy conformal field theory that mimics some of the anticipated features of the extra dimensions was considered in  @xcite , and the energy expectation value in this toy theory was found to be equal to the geon adm mass in the high temperature limit .",
    "the results presented here for the @xmath0 geon and the @xmath1 geon provide evidence that single - exterior black holes offer a nontrivial arena for scrutinizing quantum physics of black holes .",
    "it remains a subject to future work to understand to what extent the results reflect the peculiarities of these particular spacetimes , and to what extent they might have broader validity .    in some respects the @xmath0 and @xmath1 geons are certainly quite nongeneric black hole spacetimes .",
    "for example , our quotient constructions on kruskal and the spinless btz hole do not immediately generalize to accommodate spin , as the putative isometry would need to invert the angular momentum .",
    "similarly , the quotient construction on kruskal does not immediately generalize to the reissner - nordstrm hole , as the relevant isometry would invert the electric field .",
    "also , the spatial nonorientability of the @xmath1 geon may lead to difficulties in the string theoretic context .",
    "however , in 2 + 1 dimensions there exist locally  single - exterior black ( and white ) hole spacetimes that admit a spin , and one can choose their spatial topology to be orientable , for example @xmath149@xmath28point at infinity@xmath29 @xcite . a  natural next step would be to consider quantum field theory on these spinning `` wormhole '' spacetimes and on their conformal boundaries .",
