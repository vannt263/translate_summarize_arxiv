    "nature challenges us to understand phenomena in real time .",
    "this is very difficult to do in the microscopic formulation of the laws of nature given in the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "though quantum field theory is experimentally successful in understanding microscopic processes when perturbation theory works , it has very limited success in describing macroscopic phenomena in real time .",
    "the best we can typically do is to calculate rate and cross - sections using perturbation theory , and use the results as inputs for kinetic or phenomenological equations . as for example , for dilute quantum gases we can use the boltzmann equation where the two body scattering cross - section is an input",
    "however , for few systems we know how to formulate systematic corrections to the boltzmann equations , which takes into account the uncertainty principles of quantum dynamics .",
    "the main difficulty is that time - dependent perturbation theory gives us behavior in time only in a taylor series .",
    "this fails to give a uniform approximation in time away from the initial phase of evolution , and describe decoherence , thermalization and hydrodynamics in a unified framework .",
    "even when the coupling constants are small , we need an essentially non - perturbative approach to understand the origin of irreversibility from the microscopic quantum field theory .    in recent decades , there has been impressive progress in non - equilibrium quantum field theory , which attempts to bridge this gap using the two - particle irreducible action formalism .",
    "still a lot of progress is needed to develop approximation schemes which takes into account unitarity and conservation laws in a controlled manner .",
    "as these methods are non - perturbative , some progress is also needed in understanding renormalizability in these formalisms .",
    "holography in the form of gauge / gravity duality is a new tool which gives a non - perturbative reformulation of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "this is particularly tractable when the quantum field theory is a strongly coupled gauge theory and the rank of the gauge group is large . in such a case ,",
    "gauge / gravity duality maps a quantum field theory to a familar classical theory of gravity in one higher dimension . at present",
    "this is the best non - perturbative reformulation of quantum gauge theories at hand , which can describe phenomena in real time .    in this paper",
    ", we will try to unearth a special feature of holographic duality at strong coupling and large rank of the gauge group ( i.e. large @xmath0 ) , which gives a genuinely non - equilibrium result and is also a model - independent ( i.e. universal ) feature .",
    "that the viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath1 equals @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is not a genuinely non - equilibrium result by our definition , because it can be computed via holographic prescritions from thermal correlators , and applying kubo formula @xcite . ] by a genuinely non - equilibrium result , we imply one which can not be obtained readily from equilibrium correlation functions .",
    "we also try to focus on a feature which gives fundamental insight on thermalization and nature of quantum kinetics .",
    "this leads us to study non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation as described below .",
    "it is known from non - equilibrium quantum field theory , that in order to get quantum formulation of kinetic equations we need the non - equilibrium spectral and statistical functions .",
    "we define them below .",
    "the spectral function can be understood as an off - shell generalization of density of states . here",
    "we will define it for a bosonic operator @xmath3 .",
    "it can be obtained as a wigner transform of the commutator , i.e. fourier transform of the ralative coordinate as below : @xmath4 \\big{\\rangle}.\\ ] ] the expectation value value above is taken in a non - equilibrium state . in case of fermionic fields we need to take the anti - commutator above .",
    "it can be proved ( see appendix a ) that the spectral function is proportional to the imaginary part of the wigner transformed retarded green s function as below : @xmath5 therefore the spectral function is real . in case of fermionic hermitean operators it is also non - negative .",
    "physically @xmath6 encodes the probability that a quasiparticle with momentum @xmath7 at a given point in space - time given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 will have energy @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the uncertainty principle forces us to consider the quasi - particle off - shell . at strong coupling",
    "we expect broadening of peaks and typically no sharply defined quasi - particles .    at equiibrium , due to translational invariance , the spectral function @xmath6 do not depend on the center - of - mass coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is measurable by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of electrons .",
    "away from equilibrium , time resolved version of the same ( tr - arpes ) is necessary ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the statistical function can be understood as an off - shell generalization of quasi - particle distribution function in phase - space .",
    "it is the wigner transform of the anti - commutator for bosonic fields ( commutator for fermionic fields ) as below : @xmath11 we will show in the next section that the statistical function is related to the imaginary part of the wigner - transformed feynman propagator as follows : @xmath12 thus the statistical function is purely imaginary . in literature , this is often defined without a @xmath13 factor in front as in ( [ statb ] ) . in that case it is real , and when integrated over @xmath10 at fixed @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , it gives the time - dependent phase - space distribution of quasiparticles in the semiclassical limit at weak coupling . here",
    "we will keep the @xmath13 factor - in this case it is also known as the keldysh propagator .",
    "the statistical function/ keldysh propagator can be indirectly measured by following space - time evolution of expectation values of operators , like conserved currents and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we note that both the non - equilibrium statistical and spectral functions need regularization for removing ultraviolet divergences , which are however expected to be independent of the state .",
    "what is relevant for physical observations is their dependence on the non - equilibrium hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic variables characterizing the state .    at equilibrium ,",
    "the statistical function is again independent of @xmath8 and @xmath9 due to translational invariance .",
    "also it is determined from the spectral function using analyticity .",
    "the relation between the spectral function and the statistical function at equilibrium is known as the fluctuation - dissipation relation , which at thermal equilibrium is as follows in the bosonic case : @xmath14 it is called the fluctuation - dissipation relation because it implies the fluctuation - dissipation theorems @xcite , like that relating the thermal electrical noise ( current fluctuations ) to the electric resistance .",
    "away from equilibrium , analyticity is insufficient to relate the spectral and statistical functions .",
    "they evolve in a coupled way given by the so - called kadanoff - baym equations which can be derived from the two - particle irreducible action ( see section ii ) . in the semi - classical limit at weak coupling ,",
    "the kadanoff - baym equations reduce to boltzmann equation with quantum corrections .",
    "formally these equations relating off - shell quantities are valid at strong coupling also . even at weak coupling however ,",
    "non - perturbative methods are needed to make complete sense of these equations and for making systematic expansions as mentioned earlier . in general",
    "we do not expect any generalization of the flucutation - dissipation relation away from equilibrium which can be stated in a universal way independent of the details of the non - equilibrium state and the nature of external perturbations .",
    "numerical simulations of kadanoff - baym equations based on two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action at weak coupling indeed show apparent thermalization - at long time the spectral and statistical functions satisfy ( [ therm ] ) .",
    "such simulations , as for instance , in @xmath15 scalar field theories at large @xmath0 and weak coupling @xcite , indeed show thermalization ; but far away from equilibrium , there seems to be no simple fluctuation - dissipation relation between spectral and statistical functions .",
    "* summary of results :* in this paper we study the non - equilibrium spectral and statistical functions in states which are perturbatively connected to thermal equilibrium with external sources absent .",
    "these are non - equilibrium states undergoing strongly coupled hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic relaxation .    at strong coupling",
    "we expect a few operators to suffice in describing typical states .",
    "this is so because most of the operators except the relevant order parameters , conserved currents and the energy - momentum tensor will be expected to have large anomalous dimensions .",
    "this will be more generic in non - supersymmetric theories @xcite where we do not have chiral primary operators , unless there are emergent symmetries at large @xmath0 ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we can describe the non - equilibrium states holographically at strong coupling and large @xmath0 using solutions using einstein s gravity coupled to a few gauge fields ( dual to conserved currents ) and scalar fields ( dual to relevant order parameters ) .",
    "here we will further specialize to states where conserved currents and order parameters vanish in the course of evolution .",
    "thus we will be able to describe these states using the hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic quasinormal modes of pure gravity along with their non - linear evolution .",
    "the holographic prescription for obtaining the spectral function in these class of states systematically in the derivative ( hydrodynamic ) and amplitude ( non - hydrodynamic ) expansions has been obtained before . in this paper",
    "we will generalize this methodology to obtain the statistical function in the same expansions systematically .",
    "we will find that the non - equilibrium statistical function , like the non - equilibrium spectral function individually carries detailed imprint of the non - equilibrium state , particularly detailed information about the dispersion relation of the relaxation modes and their non - linear interactions .",
    "however , there is a simple generalized non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation between the spectral and statistical functions , again set exactly by the final temperature of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation being independent of the non - equilibrium state concerned is universal and is as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is set by the final equilibrium temperature .",
    "we note the definition of both , the spectral and statistical functions involve wigner transform , so this relation is non - local both in space and time .",
    "however , we recover the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation at long times when the spectral and statistical functions are independent of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . also this relation is strictly true in absence of external sources , so conservation of energy implies that the final equilibrium temperature is set by the total energy of the initial state .",
    "we elaborate later in section v that the relation is not in contradiction with locality and causality of the underlying field theory .",
    "furthermore , at strong coupling we expect the kadanoff - baym equations to have strong quantum memory , thus a boltzmann like limit where the spectral and statistical functions will behave quasi - locally is likely to be absent . therefore , the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation need not be specified by local data .",
    "what is surprising is that the only data required is the total conserved energy of the state in the large @xmath0 and strong coupling limit .",
    "this relation has been obtained in the probe - brane limit in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* methodology in brief and organization of this paper :* we describe briefly the methodology we will follow here along with the organization of this paper .    we start from non - equilibrium field theory in section ii .",
    "we review briefly the schwinger - keldysh formalism .",
    "we then obtain new parametrizations of the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation which will be necessary for having consistent derivative / amplitude expansions of the spectral and statistical functions .",
    "we show that the parameters must satisfy additional field - theoretic constraints . based on this non - equilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation",
    ", we find that any non - equilibrium green s function can be written as an appropriate weighted sum of the non - equilibrium retarded and advanced green s function .",
    "the weights are also subject to field - theoretic constraints .",
    "additionally we obtain new formal understanding of some important features of the effective action for non - equilibrium green s functions .",
    "in section iii , we review the construction of gravity duals of non - equilibrium states and introduce the derivative / amplitude expansions .",
    "we then study the dynamics of the scalar field dual to the bosonic order parameter in the same expansions .",
    "we find the unique boundary conditions for the non - equilibrium modes consistent with the derivative / amplitude expansions which give regularity at the horizon .",
    "the only new element here will be study of conjugation properties of the boundary conditions necessary for later analysis of field - theoretic constraints .",
    "in section iv , we map boundary conditions of the non - equilibrium modes to the parametrization of non - equilibrium green s functions as an appropriate sum of the non - equilibrium retarded and advanced green s functions , obtained in section ii .",
    "this map is possible because of our previous work in which the boundary conditions for the non - equilibrium modes which give solutions regular at the horizon have been identified , and have been utilized to obtain the causal response function which gives the holographic non - equilibrium retarded green s function @xcite .",
    "this builds on the holographic prescription for thermal retarded green s function proposed by son and starinets @xcite .",
    "we show the advanced response function obtained from the regular non - equilibrium solution gives the holographic non - equilibrium advanced green s function which passes field - theoretic consistency tests .",
    "we then show that the sum of causal and advanced gravitational response functions evaluated using appropriate boundary conditions map to the parametrization of the non - equilibrium feynman propagator required for it to have consistent derivative / amplitude expansions .",
    "the boundary conditions which depart from regularity are responsible for the non - equilibrium shifts in the weights of the non - equilibrium retarded and advanced green s function in the weighted sum .",
    "we then study reality constraints on the parameters obtained from field - theory and show that the only boundary conditions which are consistent are those which give regularity at the horizon .",
    "thus we find that there are no non - equilibrium shifts in the weights of the non - equilibrium retarded and advanced green s function in the weighted sum which gives the non - equilibrium feynman propagator .",
    "we also give intuitive aguments why regularity at the horizon in combination with linear response theory should determine all non - equilibrium propagators holographically .    in section",
    "v , we obtain the non - equilibrium statistical function from the non - equilibrium feynman propagator , and hence the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we argue why it s form is consistent with the locality and causality of the underlying field theory .",
    "we also give a conjecture on higher point non - equilibrium correlation functions in absence of external sources .    in section",
    "vi , we show though our holographic prescriptions generalize to some extent in higher derivative gravity , we can not expect our results to hold beyond strong coupling even when the classical gravity approximation is valid .",
    "the main reason for this will be that the bulk scalar will not be minimally coupled to gravity generically .    in section vii ,",
    "we conclude with a summary of the key results and a discussion on how the holographic non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation result can be tested in heavy ion collisions particularly .",
    "the appendices give relevant supporting material .    before proceeding further",
    ", we would like to mention that an interesting formalism has been proposed by van rees and skenderis in @xcite for doing real - time holography by construction of a gravitational analogue of the schwinger - keldysh closed time contour .",
    "though this formalism seems ideally suited for doing thermal field theory in real time , it is very difficult to adapt this to non - equilibrium states .",
    "the main difficulty lies in construction of smooth euclidean caps for non - equilibrium geometries , which is necessary in this formalism to set non - trivial initial boundary conditions , i.e. to represent creation of non - trivial states holographically .",
    "furthermore , there is an interesting approach @xcite due to son and herzog for obtaining the thermal schwinger - keldysh propagators .",
    "it is difficult to generalize this to non - equilibrium context as well as this will involve construction of penrose diagrams of non - equilibrium geometries . indeed it is not known how to do this for non - equilibrium geometries in perturbation theory .",
    "however , elements of these approaches may be concretely realized in special non - equilibrium geometries",
    ". it will be also necessary to understand how to construct the non - equilibrium spectral and statistical functions holographically in presence of external sources using systematic expansions .",
    "we leave such investigations to future work .",
    "* notations :* we will denote the position and momentum four - vectors without bold fonts , as for instance by @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the spatial position and momentum vectors will be denoted in bold fonts , as for instance by @xmath8 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "in this section , we will first briefly review the schwinger - keldysh formalism of non - equilibrium field theory .",
    "in particular we will define the effective action which gives the equation of motion of the expectation value of operators and their green s functions .",
    "then we will show formally this effective action contains no new information from the usual effective action , which is the legendre transform of the generating functional of connected vacuum correlation functions .",
    "finally we will establish some new relations between non - equilibrium green s functions of bosonic hermitean local operators .",
    "the basic tool of non - equilibrium field theory is construction of an effective action which is a functional of the operator and correlation functions .",
    "the evolution of the expectation value of the operator and the green s functions in all states , including those which are away from equilibrium , can be obtained by extremizing the effective action @xmath20 $ ] . by constuction",
    ", this effective action does not depend on any equilibrium or non - equilibrium variables like temperature , velocity or shear - stress tensor .",
    "these non - equilibrium variables parametrize the solutions , which can be obtained from definite initial conditions .",
    "the effective action @xmath20 $ ] can be defined as the double legendre transform of a generalization of the generating functional of vacuum correlation functions - @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "this generalized partition function includes not only a source @xmath22 , but also an arbitrary bi - local interaction term @xmath23 , and is defined as below : @xmath24&= & e^{i w[j , k]}\\nonumber\\\\ \\phantom{g } & = & \\int \\mathcal{d}\\phi_s \\exp \\bigg[i\\bigg(s[\\phi ] + \\int d^{4}x \\,j(x)o(x ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^4 xd^4 y \\,o(x)k(x , y)o(y)\\bigg)\\bigg ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above @xmath25 collectively denotes all the elementary fields .",
    "the operator @xmath26 which couples to @xmath27 locally and @xmath28 bi - locally is a polynomial of these elementary fields @xmath25 and their derivatives .",
    "we then define the expectation value of the operator @xmath29 and it s green s function @xmath30 through : @xmath31}{\\delta j(x ) } & = & \\mathcal{o } ( x ) , \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\delta w [ j , k]}{\\delta k(x , y ) } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg(\\mathcal{o}(x)\\mathcal{o } ( y)+ g(x , y)\\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eliminating @xmath22 and @xmath23 in favor of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we can now do double legendre transform to define the effective action as below : @xmath32 & = & w[j , k ] -   \\int d^{4}x\\ , j(x)\\mathcal{o}(x ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^4 xd^4y \\ k(x , y)\\bigg(\\mathcal{o}(x)\\mathcal{o}(y)+g(x , y)\\bigg ) .",

    "there is one important point in the above construction which we mention now . as stated in the introduction , for non - equilibrium states we need to know separately the spectral function ( the commutator / anti - commutator ) and the statistical function ( the anti - commutator / commutator ) for both bosonic / fermionic operators .    to get complete information about the non - equilibrium green s functions , we need to construct the partition function @xmath34 $ ] and consequently the effective action @xmath20 $ ] over the so - called schwinger - keldysh closed real time contour @xmath35 , as shown in fig . [ keldyshcontour ] .",
    "this time contour travels from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and then back from @xmath37 to @xmath36 , thus transversing the entire real line first forward and then backward .",
    "in fact , the full closed - time contour ordered green s function @xmath38 can be written as a combination of the commutator and the anti - commutator , and hence as a sum over the spectral function and the statistical function as below @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined according to the contour - ordering over the full closed - time contour @xmath35 .",
    "the usefulness of the effective action @xmath20 $ ] is realized only when we can reformulate it diagramatically .",
    "this has been done first in @xcite via a two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action when the operator @xmath26 is an elementary field .",
    "a full discussion of this is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "we do mention however , that though there is a diagrammatic formulation , this is non - perturbative as the lines of the diagrams are the full propagator @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the effective action @xmath20 $ ] typically admits no perturbative expansion in a small parameter .    despite this drawback , in happy circumstances , we do get good approximations to experimental results or simulations , particularly when the coupling is weak and we can have a good intuition about the relevant diagrams to sum over in the effective action @xcite .",
    "we need to resum over infinte diagrams to remove infrared divergences .",
    "there is no systematic understanding about how we can improve a given approximation while removing the infrared divergences in order to better the description .",
    "nevertheless , this is so far the best field - theoretic tool at hand which gives a fundamental description of a physical process in an approximation that is uniform in time , i.e. which not only works at initial time but also far in the future .",
    "furthermore this also reproduces quantum corrections to the boltzmann equation .",
    "we will like to demonstrate here that the effective action @xmath41 $ ] formally does not contain any more information than the usual effective action @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "we recall @xmath41 $ ] is obtained from @xmath21 $ ] by definition as in eqs .",
    "( [ fd ] ) and ( [ fd1 ] ) , while @xmath42 $ ] is obtained from the usual partition function @xmath43 $ ] , the generating functional of vacuum correlation functions .",
    "$ ] is the usual one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) effective action when @xmath44 is an elementary field .",
    "the effective action @xmath45 $ ] does not admit any perturbative expansion in a small parameter , but @xmath46 $ ] does .",
    "the effective action @xmath20 $ ] is necessary to obtain a description which is a uniform approximation in time , but our current understanding of such approximations seem to be inadequate .",
    "it is not known how to have an approximation scheme which simultaneously takes care of unitarity in a controlled manner , is renormalizable by standard counterterms and satisfies all ward identities ( for recent progress see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is useful to have an argument for why in principle all the information is there in the usual effective action @xmath47 $ ] for which such issues have been resolved .",
    "this will be useful for us later .    to show this ,",
    "it is sufficient to prove that @xmath48 $ ] can be constructed from @xmath49 $ ] , as @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] are obtained from @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] respectively via legendre transforms . from ( [ fd ] ) we readily observe that @xmath50}{\\delta k(x , y ) } = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta w[j , k]}{\\delta j(x)}\\frac{\\delta w[j , k]}{\\delta j(y ) } -\\frac{\\delta^2 w[j , k]}{\\delta j(x ) \\delta j(y ) } \\bigg),\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath51 /\\delta j(x)$ ] and @xmath52 . thus all functional @xmath53 derivatives of @xmath54 $ ] can be converted to functional @xmath55 derivatives of @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath54 $ ] can be constructed readily from @xmath56 = w[j]$ ] .",
    "this is also expected because indeed a quantum field theory is uniquely defined once we know all connected vacuum correlation functions , hence @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we will now investigate the general structure of non - equilibrium green s functions of local bosonic operators in non - equilibrium states .",
    "here the operators will be taken in the heisenberg representation .",
    "in particular , we will establish some useful relations between the retarded propagator and the feynman propagator , based on the assumption that the non - equilibrium parts of both admit systematic perturbative expansions .",
    "the definition of the feynman propagator is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes time ordering .",
    "we begin with the known relation ( for proof see appendix a ) , where it is implicitly implied that the inverse wigner transform has been done on the spectral function @xmath60 .",
    "similarly we will denote @xmath61 times the anti - commutator as @xmath62 . ] @xmath63 note this is just a special case of ( [ pe ] ) when the operator insertion are in the forward part of the closed - time contour .",
    "however , @xmath64 therefore , @xmath65 or in the wigner transformed form @xmath66 using @xmath67 which has been proved in appendix a.    we further note that @xmath68 is purely imaginary which follows from it s definition as proved in appendix a. therefore , we conclude from ( [ feyngen ] ) that @xmath69    it is to be noted that unlike the retarded green s function @xmath70 or the advanced green s function @xmath71 , the feynman propagator is not analytic in @xmath10 either in the upper - half plane or the lower - half plane .",
    "this can be seen from the instance of the vacuum feynman propagator itself in which positive frequency modes are propagated in the future and negative frequency modes are propagated in the past , i.e. the vacuum feynman propagator is @xmath72 .",
    "the term @xmath73 implies lack of analyticity in @xmath10 in the lower - half plane as the positive frequency poles are shifted there with the standard @xmath74 prescription , and similarly @xmath75 implies there is no analyticity in the upper - half plane as the negative frequency poles are shifted there .    generally speaking , if a function is analytic in a variable in the upper half plane or lower half plane , with other variables held fixed , it can be fully constructed from it s imaginary part or real part .",
    "for instance as @xmath76 ( for proof see appendix a ) , and as it is analytic in the upper - half plane in @xmath10 , in lower - half @xmath10 plane is guaranteed by the @xmath77 term in @xmath78 . ]",
    "the retarded green s function can be constructed from the spectral function using @xmath79    in case of the feynman propagator , it s real part @xmath80 and it s imaginary part @xmath68 hold independent information in non - equilibrium states which can not be kinematically constructed from the other because of non - analyticity in @xmath10 in the complex upper - half plane or the lower - half plane .",
    "we also note that as the feynman propagator is symmetric , i.e. @xmath81 , it follows that after wigner transform that @xmath82 as proved in appendix a.    the thermal feynman propagator is a linear combination of the retarded or causal response with weight @xmath83 and advanced or anti - causal response with weight @xmath84 for a given frequency , with @xmath85 being the bose - einstein distribution at temperature @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath86 as @xmath87 , @xmath88 so we recover the vacuum feynman propagator in this limit .",
    "it is not hard to see that ( [ feyn1 ] ) satisfies @xmath89 , because @xmath90 and also @xmath91 .",
    "we can rewrite the thermal feynman propagator ( [ feyn1 ] ) as : @xmath92 so , comparing ( [ feyngen ] ) with the above we get @xmath93 however , @xmath94 .",
    "so , @xmath95 the above is the fluctuation - dissipation relation in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is so - called because it implies the fluctuation - dissipation theorems @xcite , like those relating the thermal electrical noise ( current fluctuations ) to the electric resistance .",
    "we will now try to parameterize non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation . using this",
    ", we will get a parameterization of non - equilibrium green s functions .",
    "let us assume we are near equilibrium .",
    "then the non - equilibrium state can be parametrized in terms of hydrodynamic and relaxational modes .",
    "this will allow us to do a perturbative expansion .",
    "let us for instance linearize the state in terms of hydrodynamic fluctuations @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in this approximation , both the spectral and statistical functions will depend linearly on these variables .",
    "thus the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation will be linear in this approximation .",
    "the exact nature of the dependence of the spectral and statistical functions on the hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic variables will be determined later in the holographic classical gravity approximation . as of now",
    ", we will take this dependence to be implicit .",
    "it is also clear we can improve the linear approximation by including quadratic dependence of the spectral and statistical functions on the hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic variables which we will do systematically later .",
    "the general structure will be as follows : @xmath98 above the superscript @xmath99 denotes the order of multi - linear dependence of the term on the non - equilibrium variables .",
    "the non - equilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation can be parametrized as follows : @xmath100 above @xmath101 is real because each term in the expansion of @xmath60 is real while each term in the @xmath68 is purely imaginary .",
    "also the bose - einstein distribution @xmath102 appearing above is always determined by the final equilibrium temperature .",
    "furthermore as we have shown in appendix a , because @xmath62 is symmetric in @xmath103 and @xmath104 , after wigner transform it should satisfy @xmath105 .",
    "similarly as shown in appendix a , @xmath106 . therefore , these imply that @xmath107    similarly , at the next order @xmath108 again by definition @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 have to be real and the bose - einstein distribution @xmath102 appearing above is always determined by the final equilibrium temperature .",

    "the last two terms of ( [ fdneq2 ] ) are linear while the remaining terms are non - linear corrections to the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation .",

    "each such solution maps to a non - equilibrium state via gauge / gravity duality at strong coupling and large @xmath0 .",
    "each such non - equilibrium state can be characterized by the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor alone , because this determines the dual solution in gravity which is a regular perturbation of anti - de sitter black brane completely @xcite .",
    "conceptually , these states are similar to certain special solutions of the boltzmann equation called conservative solutions , which are completely determined by the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",

    "these conditions indeed are valid for the quark - gluon plasma produced by heavy ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven and at a large ion collider experiment ( alice ) in cern .    thus our non - equilibrium backgrounds can be modeled by the regular perturbations of @xmath171 black branes in vacuum einstein s gravity . as we are interested in the two - point correlations in these non - equilibrium geometries , we can ignore the backreaction of the scalar field , which will contribute only to higher - point correlations .",

    "also as discussed before , the integration over the hydrodynamic frequencies @xmath166 and @xmath293 will produce a divergence at the horizon for the incoming mode , as for instance in the case above with dependence on two hydrodynamic shear wave background modes like : @xmath294 obviously the coefficient of the incoming mode has to depend on @xmath147 and @xmath295 as required by the order in the perturbation expansion as in ( [ coeffs ] ) . the poles in @xmath166 and @xmath296 as in ( [ uft ] ) produce the above divergent behavior after integration over contour @xmath189 or @xmath187 . in a consistent holographic set - up , the particular solution should be regular at the horizon .",
    "thus the full solution of the scalar field in the non - equilibrium background is undertermined only up to an overall constant @xmath202 .",

    "these geometries represents non - equilibrium states which are perturbatively connected to thermal equilibrium in the derivative and amplitude expansions . utilizing these expansions",
    ", we will now build a framework in which we can determine the non - equilibrium corrections to the green s functions holographically .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the non - equilibrium modification of the solution of the scalar field is determined uniquely by regularity .",
    "we required the non - equilibrium modes generated by the background quasi - normal modes to be regular at the horizon .",
    "it amounted to putting both the boundary conditions at the horizon , namely setting the coefficient of the incoming and outgoing homogeneous solutions to zero .",
    "we may wonder what is the physical significance of putting both boundary conditions at the horizon in terms of the dual field theory .",
    "this has been partly explored in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we indeed expect that the external source will receive non - equilibrium medium modifications just like the expectation value of the operator .",
    "this is because the external source as seen by the quasiparticles should be screened by the non - equilibrium collective excitations of the medium .",
    "thus the dirichlet boundary condition is the wrong thing to use for the non - equilibrium bulk modes as this would imply no such screening happens @xcite .",
    "secondly , the quasi - particle dispersion relation is modified by the non - equilibrium collective excitations of the medium . we know for instance the mass of the quasiparticles receive thermal contributions . taking this thermal mass into account",
    "is necessary for curing infrared divergences in thermal field theory . in non - equilibrium field theory",
    "the effective mass is space - time dependent , which is natural given that the temperature is space - time dependent as well .",
    "furthermore , the effective mass can depend as well on the velocity and shear - stress perturbations also .",
    "there is no systematic way to obtain the dependence of the effective mass as a function of the background temperature , velocity and shear - stress perturbations in non - equilibrium field theory .",
    "our holographic prescription gives a way to achieve this .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion relation in equilibrum is obtained by solving for @xmath308 at a given @xmath7 , such that the external source satisfies @xmath309 , the latter being determined by the incoming boundary condition at the horizon .",
    "this can be readily generalized to non - equilibrium to obtain the space - time dependent shifts of the quasi - particle dispersion relations as parametrized by the background velocity , temperature and shear - stress perturbations @xcite .",
    "this is reviewed in appendix c.    the shift in the effective mass should come from resummation of infra - red divergences . as the infra - red physics is given by the dynamics of the horizon holographically ,",
    "this indeed justifies why both the boundary conditions for the non - equilibrium modes should be applied at the horizon .",
    "thus we determine the non - equilibrium modification of the source uniquely and hence the spacetime shifts of the quasiparticle dispersion relations .    building on this intuition",
    ", we can claim that the dependence of the non - equilibrium contributions of the green s functions on the temperature , velocity and shear - stress perturbations characterizing the collective excitations should also come from resumming infra - red divergences .",
    "hence , we can build on the hypothesis that the boundary conditions which will determine the non - equilibrium contributions to the propagators should be applied at the horizon .",
    "thus we will examine general boundary conditions at the horizon which need not lead to a regular solution in the bulk . in the next subsection",
    ", we will study how the non - equilibrium corrections to the external source and the expectation value of the operator are parametrized by these boundary conditions .",
    "then in the following subsection , we will use linear response theory and field theoretic consistency to determine the relevant boundary conditions for a given non - equilibrium green s function .",
    "we will find eventually that regularity at the horizon determines all the non - equilibrium green s functions in the holographic classical gravity approximation . in the final subsection we will return to non - equilibrium field theory to intuitively understand this .",
    "for the moment , let us assume we have specified a pair of boundary conditions at the horizon which need not give a solution which is regular at the horizon .",
    "this means we have made specific choices of @xmath310 and @xmath310 , the coefficients of the two homogeneous solutions .",
    "any such choice has to be consistent with derivative and amplitude expansions .",
    "as for instance in ( [ coeffs ] ) , this amounts to making arbitrary choices for @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "after such choices are made , the entire solution is determined uniquely .",
    "we can readily determine the normalizable and non - normalizable modes from the solution by following it s behavior at the boundary .",
    "the full non - normalizable mode , which is sum of the equilibrium and non - equilibrium parts , is identified with the external source coupling to the dual operator .",
    "let us denote this as @xmath313 .",
    "the full normalizable mode is identified with the expectation value of the dual operator in the dual state , namely @xmath29 .",
    "thus the equilibrium part of the source and expectation value of the operator can be obtained from the behavior of @xmath314 near @xmath315 , as below : @xmath316 above @xmath317 is the anomalous dimension of the dual operator and is related to the mass of the bulk scalar field by @xmath318 the non - equilibrium corrections to the source and the expectation value of the operator in the dual non - equilibrium state can be obtained from the behavior of @xmath319 and @xmath320 near @xmath315 , @xmath321 in case of the hydrodynamic shear mode background , for example , the non - equilibrium source and expectation value takes the form as can be seen from ( [ solh1 ] ) : @xmath322 above @xmath323 are obtained from asymptotic expansions of @xmath324 .",
    "similarly @xmath325 are obtained from the asymptotic expansions of @xmath326 .",
    "we note each of @xmath324 and @xmath326 are solutions of the radial equation , therefore have the same asymptotic expansions .",
    "furthermore , using the specific form of the coefficients @xmath327 as given in ( [ coeffs ] ) , it is easy to see that the non - equilibrium modifications of the external source and the expectation value take the form : @xmath328 with @xmath329 in this form it is explicitly clear how the non - equilibrium modifications of the source and the expectation value depend on the boundary conditions at the horizon , namely in the choice of @xmath330 .",
    "the full space - time dependence of the source @xmath313 and the expectation value of the operator @xmath29 thus take the form : @xmath331    after the integrations over @xmath167 required to take the background on - shell are done as above , we are left with the residues at the poles of the quasi - normal modes .",
    "therefore , @xmath332 thus in the case of the hydrodynamic shear - mode background we get @xmath333 where @xmath334 with @xmath335 given by ( [ jo2 ] ) . comparing ( [ jo1 ] ) and ( [ jo3 ] ) , we see that we have extracted the residue of @xmath336 as given in ( [ uft ] ) at the poles @xmath337 .",
    "in general @xmath338 will take the form @xmath339 with @xmath327 and @xmath340 having consistent derivative and amplitude expansions .",
    "as for instance @xmath341",
    ".    the above discussion is readily generalized by including non - linearities in the dynamics of the non - equilibrium perturbations of the background .",
    "as for instance , if we take into account the quadratic dependence on two hydrodynamic shear modes @xmath147 and @xmath295 , the corrections will take the form , @xmath342 after doing integrations over @xmath166 and @xmath296 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath343 at the first order in the derivative expansion .",
    "all these terms are fixed uniquely in terms of the boundary conditions at the horizon .",
    "the general form of the non - equilibrium corrections to source and expectation value as in ( [ gso ] ) after including non - linear dynamics of the background involves @xmath344 which will appear with a spatio temporal factor @xmath345      there is a basic linear response to an external perturbation in any physical system - the causal response .",
    "this causal response gives the retarded green s function .",
    "holographically , the equilibrium causal response maps to the incoming boundary condition at the horizon @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be the case because it is the only boundary condition that is consistent with the causal structure of the black hole which forbids anything propagating out of the horizon classically .",
    "we have seen that the incoming equilibrium solution of the bulk scalar field has a unique non - equilibrium correction which is regular at the horizon and is free of potentially harmful back - reaction at the future horizon .",
    "we need regularity at the horizon to preserve the global causal structure of the black brane .",
    "we recall that this non - equilibrium solution which is regular at the horizon requires very specific boundary conditions at the horizon .",
    "these boundary conditions have been determined even after including non - linearities in the dynamics of the perturbations of the background quasi - normal modes .",
    "furthermore , this non - equilibrium solution which is regular at the future horizon uniquely determines the non - equilibrium modifications to the external source and expectation value of the dual operator .",
    "it has been proposed that it determines the non - equilibrium corrections to the causal response , and therefore the non - equilibrium retarded green s function @xcite .",
    "the retarded green s function in any state is given by the causal response in that state .",
    "thus the holographic non - equilibrium retarded green s function is : @xmath346    let us go back to the linearized approximation when the non - equilibrium perturbation in the background is given by a single quasi - normal mode or a single relaxation mode in the dual theory",
    ". then the full spatio - temporal form of @xmath347 and @xmath348 above is as in ( [ jog]).the boundary conditions required for regularity at the horizon are that the coefficients of the homogeneous solutions @xmath327 should be set to zero , so that the non - equilibrium corrections to external source/ expectation value are given fully by @xmath349 respectively .",
    "one can see that after doing the wigner transform ( for intermediate steps see appendix",
    "d ) the non - equilibrium retarded green s function takes the following form @xcite : @xmath350,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath351 being the equilibrium retarded green s function and @xmath352 the complex conjugate mode corrections included above needed for complete field - theoretic consistency ( see below ) were not included in our earlier work @xcite .    the crucial elements to note are :    * the non - equilibrium contributions involve two pieces , spatio - temporally comoving with the background quasi - normal modes at momenta @xmath353 respectively .",
    "* the non - equilibrium contributions to the equilibrium retarded propagator at frquency @xmath10 and momentum @xmath7 involves a convolution with support at momenta @xmath354 and poles at frequencies @xmath355 .",
    "these features reflect the classical gravity approximation .",
    "we will see how these generalize beyond the quasi - normal mode approximation of the background .    also note that as the non - equilibrium correction to the equilibrium solution which is regular at the future horizon is unique , the overall solution is undetermined up to an overall multiplicative constant @xmath202 as in ( [ gp ] ) .",
    "this multiplicative constant @xmath202 cancels between the numerator and denominator in ( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "therefore the non - equilibrium retarded green s function is uniquely determined by this holographic prescription .",
    "the advanced green s function should be naturally related to the advanced response .",
    "thus , @xmath356 the above also follows from the definitions that @xmath357 ( for proof of the latter see appendix a ) .",
    "for the holographic definition of advanced response , both @xmath348 and @xmath347 above must be evaluated in the same non - equilibrium solution as in ( [ rdef ] ) in the case of the retarded propagator , i.e. in the solution involving the unique correction to the equilibrium incoming mode which is regular at the future horizon .",
    "therefore , @xmath348 and @xmath347 take the form as in ( [ jog ] ) with @xmath358 .    from appendix",
    "a , it follows that after the wigner transform @xmath359 . therefore @xmath360 is given by ( [ retpw ] ) with @xmath361 replaced by @xmath362 .",
    "also @xmath67 as proved in appendix a. this is also satisfied as can be seen from ( [ retpw ] ) using @xmath363 . to do this",
    "one first reverses the sign of the integrated variables @xmath364 and @xmath365 and then uses results from section iii.c which imply that @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "thus our holographic prescriptions for the non - equilibrium retarded and advanced propagators pass important field - theoretic conssitency tests .    at the beginning of this section ,",
    "we have already made the hypothesis that non - equilibrium green s functions in the holographic classical gravity approximation should be determined by appropriate boundary conditions at the horizon .",
    "these boundary conditions should be determined by the consistency of the map with field - theoretic requirements .    in order to map non - equilibrium green s function to boundary conditions at the horizon , we start from the gravity side .",
    "consider an arbitrary solution of the bulk scalar field in the non - equilibrium geometry which is consistent with the derivative / amplitude expansions but not necessarily regular at the horizon .",
    "this means that the space - time profile of the source and expectation value takes the form ( [ jog ] ) with the non - equilibrium parts taking the general form ( [ gso ] ) .",
    "we should make a choice of both @xmath368 and @xmath369 to specify the solution uniquely .",
    "this amounts to making choices of coefficients of @xmath311 and @xmath312 of terms like @xmath370 , @xmath371 in their derivative / amplitude expansions as in ( [ coeffs ] ) .",
    "the most well - defined response functions on the gravity side are the causal and advanced response functions .",
    "let us consider the following response function evaluated in an arbitrary non - equilibrium solution : @xmath372    physically the boundary conditions given by choice of @xmath368 and @xmath369 can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the full response function above at equilibrium is the sum of the causal response with weight @xmath373 and the advanced response with weight @xmath374 .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath368 and @xmath369 thus shift the weight of the non - equilibrium causal response and the non - equilibrium advanced response in the total weighted sum , because individually they are given by the boundary conditions @xmath368 and @xmath369 set to zero .",
    "it is then easy to repeat the steps which lead from ( [ rdef ] ) to ( [ retpw ] ) as explicitly shown in appendix d. we find that ( [ grav ] ) reproduces our general parametrization of any non - equilibrium green s function as a weighted sum of the retarded and advanced green s functions ( [ gnp ] ) , which is valid at the leading order in amplitude expansion , with the identification @xmath375 where @xmath376 also @xmath377 is given by the above equations ( [ fra ] ) and ( [ mn ] ) with @xmath373 replaced by @xmath374 and @xmath378 replaced by @xmath362 .    thus there is a map between between parameters @xmath379 in the leading order parametrization ( [ gnp ] ) of non - equilibrium green s functions required for consistent pertubation expansions and leading order boundary conditions @xmath327 for the non - equilibrium modes set at the horizon .",
    "however , @xmath379 should also satisfy other field - theoretic requirements , aside from producing consistent derivative and amplitude expansions .",
    "let us work this out explicitly for the non - equilibrium feynman propagator .",
    "in this case we should set in the gravity response function ( [ grav ] ) @xmath380 and @xmath381 to reproduce the equilibrium feynman propagator .",
    "the holographic non - equilibrium feynman propagator @xmath382 is therefore given by @xmath383 with both @xmath347 and @xmath348 evaluated in a non - equilibrium solution with boundary conditions given by @xmath368 and @xmath369 , both of which we should determine now using field theoretic consistency conditions .    note the holographic feynman propagator ( [ holfeyn ] ) is symmetric in @xmath103 and @xmath104 as required .",
    "this can be seen by exchanging @xmath103 and @xmath104 while reversing the signs of the integrated variables @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "let us now compare the holographic form of the non - equilibrium feynman propagator ( [ holfeyn ] ) with the parametrization ( [ nfeyn ] ) that yields consistent perturbative expansions obtained earlier .",
    "our comparison yields that @xmath384 where @xmath385 is given by ( [ fra ] ) with @xmath380 and @xmath386 is also given by ( [ fra ] ) with @xmath373 replaced by @xmath387 .",
    "also @xmath388 denotes the principal value .    for the case of the feynman propagator , using ( [ ainoutcc ] ) and",
    "@xmath389 we find that @xmath390 we can now compare with the requirements ( [ fprop ] ) to obtain @xmath391 we recall that the above implies that the constraint of symmetry in @xmath103 and @xmath104 is satisfied for the holographic @xmath382 , which is also evident in the defining form ( [ holfeyn ] ) .",
    "there are two crucial field theoretic requirements in ( [ fprop ] ) which should be additionally satisfied in the above identifcations .",
    "these are that @xmath392 and @xmath393 should be real .",
    "one can readily see from ( [ fra ] ) that it is impossible to satisfy these for all @xmath18 unless both @xmath394 and @xmath395 both vanish identically .",
    "the latter is possible only when @xmath284 and @xmath283 are both set to zero giving the solution which is regular at the horizon .",
    "this implies there are no non - equilibrium shifts in the weights of the causal and advanced responses in ( [ holfeyn ] ) .",
    "thus we have proved when the quasinormal approximation of the background is valid , @xmath396 this simply follows from [ holfeyn ] using boundary conditions where @xmath284 and @xmath283 are set to zero in ( [ holfeyn ] ) and then doing wigner transform .",
    "we can now go beyond the quasinormal mode approximation of the background .",
    "this means taking into account non - linearities in the dynamics of the hydrodynamic and relaxational modes constituting the non - equilibrium state .",
    "we note that ( [ rdef ] ) still gives the holographic retarded green s function because it follows from linear response theory - the expectation value and source are obtained from the full non - equilibrium solution which depends non - linearly on the non - equilibrium perturbations @xmath193 and @xmath194 and is regular at the future horizon .",
    "we have discussed how we obtain this full non - equilibrium solution in section iii.c - namely we apply the same boundary conditions which cut down both the homogeneous incoming and outgoing solutions at each order in the amplitude perturbation expansion .",
    "the retarded response function depends non - linearly on each term in the perturbation expansion though .",
    "let us denote @xmath99 as the order in the amplitude expansion , i.e. it counts the total number of pertubation parameters @xmath193 and @xmath194 as in section iii.c . then the retarded green s function up to @xmath397-th order in the amplitude expansion is obtained from @xmath398 at the @xmath397-th order we not only get @xmath399 but also @xmath400 . above",
    "we have suppressed the derivative expansion , but it clear we can do a double expansion in the derivatives and amplitudes of the background perturbation close to equilibrium .    similarly the advanced green s function is given by ( [ addef ] ) , but the expectation value and the source are obtained from the full non - equilibrium solution which is regular at the horizon .",
    "one can readily check that the full holographic retarded and advanced propagators also satisfy the relation @xmath67 simply repeating the same steps discussed earlier to all orders in the perturbation expansion .",
    "one can now map the holographic linear response as given by ( [ grav ] ) to a given non - equilibrium propagator . in ( [ grav ] )",
    "we need to use an appropriate boundary conditions at the horizon instead of those fixed by regularity at each order in the amplitude expansion .",
    "these boundary conditions give the non - equilibrium shifts of the weight of the retarded and advanced green s functions which consitute the given non - equilibrium propagator .",
    "it is also easy to see that , at the second order in the amplitude expansion , we will obtain the same structure ( [ g2 ] ) as we argued from field theory from the holographic response ( [ grav ] ) .",
    "namely @xmath401 will depend on the boundary conditions on the solutions @xmath402 , where @xmath397 and @xmath231 denote the order of the derivative expansion acting on each of the two amplitude expansions .",
    "these are reflected by the boundary conditions given by @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",
    "we note that the reality constraints ( [ ainoutcc ] ) tells us there are exactly four independent boundary conditions for the four independent parameters @xmath401 . without writing the detailed expression for @xmath401",
    "we can readily see that taking all orders in derivative expansion into account ,    * the dependence on @xmath7 is given by a sum of four terms which get supported by @xmath405 respectively , * as function of @xmath10 , these terms have poles in @xmath406 respectively , where @xmath407 and @xmath408 are the complex dispersion relations of the two quasinormal modes appearing at the quadratic order , * the space - time dependences are given by @xmath409 respectively .",
    "one can similarly work out that @xmath410 are dertermined by @xmath411 , the boundary conditions appearing at the linear order in the amplitude expansion .",
    "we can now specialize to the holographic feynman propagator as given by ( [ holfeyn ] ) .",
    "we can see that we reproduce the general form ( [ feynamp2 ] ) at the second order in the amplitude expansion .",
    "we get @xmath412 similarly from the boundary conditions at the quadratic order and satisfy the properties listed above . once again these satisfy the symmetry requirements but not reality constraints at all @xmath8 and @xmath9 unless both @xmath413 and @xmath414 are set to zero , thus the solution is taken to be exactly the same as given by regularity at the horizon . similarly one can show that @xmath110 in ( [ feynamp2 ] ) should also vanish .",
    "this result generalizes to higher orders in the amplitude expansion .",
    "thus we show that the holographic feynman propagator is given by ( [ holffin ] ) to all orders in the amplitude expansion .",
    "in other words only the solution which is regular at the horizon contributes in the linear response ( [ holfeyn ] ) holographically in determining the non - equilibrium feynman propagator",
    ".    given that both the non - equilibrium retarded green s function and feynman propagator are determined by the regular solution , all non - equilibrium propagators are also determined as well by the regular solution in the gravitational response ( [ grav ] ) . thus the boundary conditions which determine the non - equilibrium corrections to the green s functions are determined by regularity alone .",
    "our main result is that the regularity at the horizon and linear response theory together determine all the non - equilibrum green s functions holographically .",
    "we can try to understand the physical significance of this result in terms of the dual field theory .",
    "clearly the non - equilibrium dynamics of the expectation value of the operator , as for instance the energy - momentum tensor , is determined by regularity at the horizon .",
    "indeed this is how hydrodynamic transport coefficients are determined . in field theory",
    "this is given by the effective action @xmath415 $ ] as discussed in section ii .",
    "we recall from section ii.a that the non - equilibrium evolution of the propagators is given by the effective action @xmath416 $ ] evaluated over the schwinger - keldysh contour . in section ii.a",
    "we also showed that the effective action @xmath416 $ ] can be obtain from @xmath415 $ ] applying functional identities .",
    "thus , we should require no new information to determine the dynamics of non - equilibrium green s functions other than those required to determine the non - equilibrium evolution of the expectation value of the operator .",
    "holographically , this should imply that , just as regularity at the horizon is a sufficient principle to determine the non - equilibrium evolution of the expectation value of the operator , it should be a sufficient principle to determine the non - equilibrium green s functions also .",
    "so the results of section ii.a give a field theoretic justification of the holographic arguments advanced here .",
    "in the previous section we have proved that the holographic non - equilibrium feynman propagator is given by ( [ holffin ] ) .",
    "this result is true in non - equilibrium states close to thermal equilibrium , or more precisely in states perturbatively connected to equilibrium in derivative and amplitude expansions .",
    "this result holds in the absence of any external forces .",
    "also this result is valid even when the non - linearities in the dynamics of hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic variables characterizing the non - equilibrium state are taken into account .    from the holographic feynman propagator ( [ holffin ] )",
    ", one can readily obtain the non - equilibrium statistical function using ( [ feynreim ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain the holographic non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation : @xmath417 we recall again that the bose - einstein distribution @xmath102 above is determined by the temperature of final thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus at long times we recover the usual equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we may wonder if this result is in contradiction with locality and causality of the dual field theory , because it depends on the temperature of thermal equilibrium to be attained in the future .",
    "this is not the case because of the following reasons :    * the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ holflucdis ] ) relates the wigner transformed statistical function @xmath68 and @xmath60 .",
    "the wigner transform involves fourier transform in the relative coordinate @xmath418 both in @xmath62 and @xmath419 .",
    "the fourier transform receives contributions from all values of the relative coordinate @xmath418 , thus both @xmath68 and @xmath60 are non - local in space and time by construction . * the result ( [ holflucdis ] ) is true strictly in the absence of external forces . in such situations",
    ", no energy is being pumped in externally , therefore the final equilibrium temperature is fixed by the total energy of the initial state .",
    "so there is no teleological adjustment involved as it may naively appear to be the case .",
    "crucially @xmath68 and @xmath60 behave as local objects in space - time typically at weak coupling . in this case , the kadanoff - baym equations governing their evolution reduces approximately to boltzmann equation which is local in space and time . at strong coupling",
    "we do not expect this to be the case , therefore we have no reason to expect that @xmath68 and @xmath60 will be related by local data .",
    "what we find is that the total conserved energy in the laboratory frame is sufficient to relate them - we do not need any more details of the non - equilibrium state , provided the field theory can be described holographically and the classical gravity approximation with a minimally coupled bulk scalar is valid . individually @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath60 though , carries detailed information of the relaxational modes of the system and their non - linear dynamics .",
    "we also note that in the late equilibrium state where our derivative and amplitude expansions are valid , the background hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic variables satisfy generic phenomenological equations which can be derived from classical gravity ( for details see appendix b ) .",
    "these phenomenological equations , just like navier - stokes equation hold irrespctively of initial conditions .",
    "the dual geometries have regular future horizons .",
    "nevertheless , we can expect that not all solutions of these generic equations can be lifted to solutions in the field theory",
    ". only a class of dual non - equilibrium geometries will also be regular in the past , and these will be genuine solutions in field theory .",
    "however , regularity in the past can not be analyzed in perturbative derivative and amplitude expansions .",
    "thus there will indeed be hidden constrants in the initial conditions for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath194 coming from the requirement of regularity in the past .",
    "nevertheless , these do not affect our main conclusions , at least for the large class of non - equilibrium states which admit permit perturbative derivative and amplitude expansions in the future .",
    "we may also ask how this result may generalize to higher point non - equilibrium green s functions . to address this , we have to study the backreaction of the scalar field on the background geometry with an arbitrary external source at the boundary . regarding the generalization we make the following conjectures :    * in the classical gravity approximation , the fully causal higher point green s function @xmath420 ...... ]]\\big{\\rangle}$ ] can be determined from the regular solution alone . *",
    "the other higher point green s functions can be obtained from the causal higher - point function using their general field - theoretic properties and the consistency of their allowed forms with the classical gravity approximation .",
    "the first point above simply says that a regular future horizon determines the full causal structure and hence the causal green s functions .",
    "the second point above generalizes our derivation of the holographic feynman propagator .",
    "this conjecture says that we do not need to construct any partition function to obtain non - equilibrium correlation functions - general dynamical principles should suffice to determine them as in field theory . in future work , we would like to test or prove this conjecture .",
    "we will find here that we can not certainly say that our results will survive the stringy corrections which typically give @xmath421 corrections in the strong coupling limit as a function of the dimensionless coupling @xmath422 . in gauge theories , @xmath422 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "nevertheless all of our conclusions generalize even if there is stringy corrections in gravity dynamics ( involving higher orders in curvatures and their derivatives ) , provided the scalar field dual to the operator is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the latter is certainly not guaranteed , but could be true in supersymmetric contexts .",
    "firstly , we will show that our presciptions which give solutions which are regular at the future horizon in the non - equilibrium geometry , indeed remain valid as long as the bulk scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we observe that the structure of the homogeneous incoming solution near the horizon can be determined from geometric optics , if the bulk scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we can certainly construct an appropriate function of @xmath423 which we denote as @xmath424 such that the incoming radial null geodesic at the horizon is : @xmath425 clearly @xmath426 has to increase monotonically as @xmath423 moves towards the horizon because of blue - shifting .",
    "the homogeneous incoming wave solution in the thermal background by a quasi - normal mode perturbation will always behave like : @xmath427 near the horizon at the leading order , as the geometrical optics approximation is always good at the horizon due to the blue - shifting .",
    "therefore , as long as thermal geometry is stable , the integration over @xmath186 which we need to do to put the metric on - shell , will produce a divergent factor : @xmath428 if the thermal background is stable , all it s quasi - normal fluctuatons should satisfy @xmath429 . therefore the homogeneous incoming solution will always be divergent at the horizon .",
    "on the other hand the argument that the outgoing modes will cause divergent backreaction at the horizon is based on analyticity in @xmath10 - this remains true as long as the thermal backgound is stable .    in any consistent classical gravity ,",
    "the black brane dual to the thermal background should be stable , thus we need to cut down both the homogeneous incoming and outgoing modes for regularity at the horizon .",
    "the chain of arguments determining non - equilibrium propagators , similarly will also carry through all the way to the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ holflucdis ] )",
    ". this will be true provided the black brane do not support quasi - normal modes where both the momentum and frequency could be imaginary , or where the frequency / momentum is imaginary while the momentum / frequency vanishes respectively .",
    "one can check , if this happens , the reality arguments which cut down other boundary conditions to determine non - equilibirum propagators other than those required by regularity , will no longer hold .    in fact , a quasinormal mode with imaginary momentum at zero frequency , will signify the existence of hair . also , a quasinormal mode with imaginary frequency at zero momentum can be interpreted as a thermal tensor - like goldstone mode .",
    "the first situation is unlikely as usually black branes do not have hair .",
    "the second situation is unlikely as usally in field theories we do not have spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry .",
    "even if the bulk scalar remains minimally coupled taking stringy corrections into account , we still need some care . though the equations of motion may admit systematic perturbative expansion in @xmath421 , all solutions which thermalize to black branes need not admit such expansion .",
    "also we can not take the limit @xmath430 smoothly , as in this limit curvature diverges asymptotically .",
    "therefore , we still need to be on the strong coupling side , for our results to generalize",
    ".    we may conclude that the nonequilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ holflucdis ] ) requires not only the validity of the classical gravity approximation , but also the classical theory of gravity to be nearly einstein s theory , and the bulk scalar field to be minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the key points of this paper may be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the holographic non - equilibrium spectral function carries systematic information about the relaxation modes of the system and their collective non - linear dynamics . *",
    "the holographic prescription for obtaining the non - equilibrium spectral function is independent of the non - equilibrium state i.e. the gravitational background and is obtained from requiring regularity at the horizon at strong coupling and large @xmath0 .",
    "* this holographic prescription should also hold in any theory of classical gravity which has a stable thermal background as a solution as long as the bulk scalar dual to the bosonic operator is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "* it is possible to map the parametrization of non - equilibrium green s functions required for their consistent derivative / amplitude expansions to linear response functions in gravity using arbitrary boundary conditions for the non - equilibrium modes .",
    "* field - theoretic consistency determines the holographic non - equilibrium feynman propagator . * from the holographic non - equilibrium feynman propagator , we obtain the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation . *",
    "the holographic non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation holds universally for any non - equilibrium state at strong coupling in the classical gravity approximation and thus provides a potentially strong test of the applicability of holographic duality .",
    "except for the first two points , all these have been derived in this paper .",
    "we may now discuss how can the holographic scenario be tested in rhic or alice .",
    "our discussion will assume that the plasma produced by the heavy - ion collision undergo three stages of evolution - ( i ) the initial phase ( ii ) a strongly coupled nearly conformal phase , and ( iii ) the final hadron gas phase .",
    "the classical gravity approximation studied here can only apply to the middle phase of evolution .",
    "this picture is supported by lattice studies as in @xcite where it was found that qcd is inded close to a strongly coupled fixed point at a scale of about 175 mev ( which is nearly the temperature of the quark - gluon plasma produced at rhic / alice ) for small chemical potentials .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed incredibly short time of thermalization ( @xmath431 1 fm / c ) @xcite .",
    "we note that in the early stage of the ultra - relativistic collisions we may use perturbative qcd which gives a quantum kinetic theory involving quarks and gluons . in this case , we may use models like @xcite .",
    "we may also use color glass condensate models where the two particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action technique has been used to obtain growth of fluctuations and correlations of various operators @xcite . in the late stage of expansion of the fireball , we can use the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) simulations which models the quantum kinetics of the hadron gas @xcite . the holographic fluctuation and correlation of the chiral condensate",
    "needs to be matched with the quantum kinetics of the early and late phase of the expansion to obtain a complete picture that can be tested experimentally .    in the holographic phase",
    ", we may use the gravitational backgrounds provided by einstein s gravity with anti de - sitter boundary conditions to calculate the non - equilibrium spectral function .",
    "the non - equilibrium spectral function gives us a way to determine the collective non - linear dynamics of the relaxation modes and thus check if the phenomenological equations obtained from gravity really describe the space - time evolution of the fireball in the strongly coupled phase .",
    "the latter can also be tested independently by detailed measurement of transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficient of the hadron gas .",
    "a mutual confirmation will be a strong test for holography .",
    "the non - equilibrium spectral function combined with the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation gives sufficient data to match with correlations of emission of pions and their resonances in the later stage of expansion , as pions and their resonances have the same quantum numbers as the chiral condensate .",
    "thus we can build a more sophisticated theory of pion interferometry to reconstruct the expansion of the fireball and test the holographic non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "as the fluctuation - dissipation relation holds universally for any non - equilibrium state in the classical gravity approximation , it s validation will indeed be a very strong test for holography .",
    "in fact , it has been observed that statistical models using pure thermal estimates work very well for predicting the spectrum of hadrons produced from the fireball with the temperature being set to the value at which the fireball thermalizes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is surprising given that the phase transition does not occur adiabatically .",
    "this may already hint that the holographic non - equilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation is valid to a good accuracy .",
    "the statistical function of the chiral condensate carries direct information about the production of pions and their resonances .",
    "thus a time - resolved study of emission of pions and their resonances will allow us to determine the non - equilibrium statistical function once we know how to match it s evolution to the early and final phases",
    ".    a more refined time - resolved study of correlations of emitted pions and their resonances will allow determination of the non - equilibrium spectral function .",
    "this also needs to be matched with the early and late stages of evolution .",
    "having thus determined the non - equilibrium statistical and spectral functions individually , we can check the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the matching can be done by noting the following that in the holographic phase , the non - equilibrium state , and also the non - equilibrium spectral and statistical functions , can be parametrized by a few non - equilibrium variables like the hydryodynamic variables and the shear - stress tensor .",
    "these variables represent the expectation value of a handful of operators like the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "thus the matching can be realized by tracking the evolution of these operators .",
    "some interesting progress has already been made in this direction @xcite .",
    "it thus looks possible that the holographic non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation can be tested in the future in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this may also lead to an accurate experimental determination of the temperature at which the plasma thermalizes",
    ".    it will be also interesting to understand how the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation be measured in order parameter correlations in quantum critical systems .",

    "the regularity analysis of the metric ( [ metrichr ] ) is subtle and involves it s translation to eddington - finkelstein coordinates .",

    "the coefficients @xmath512 and @xmath513 denote coupling of @xmath475 and it s local time - derivatives to hydrodynamic variables . to determine these",
    ", one needs to construct metrics with regular future horizons for configuration where @xmath464 and @xmath59 vary spatially and temporally , while @xmath475 is non - zero .",
    "holographically the vanishing of the source gives the quasi - particle poles ( which can be so broad that we may not call them quasi - particles ) . at equilibrium @xmath514 vanishes only when @xmath10 takes certain discrete values at a given @xmath7 .",
    "we may select a branch of quasi - particle pole given by : @xmath515 these correspond to the poles which can be complex generally .",
    "the non - equilibrium modification depends on space and time , and takes the form @xmath516 the non - equilibrium shift in the pole @xmath517 can be obtained by solving @xmath518 perturbatively @xcite .",
    "this amounts to solving the linear complex equation : @xmath519 the non - equilibrium parts of the source , or equivalently the right hand side of the above is determined completely by the equilibrium source by our prescription at the horizon .",
    "this is precisely what we expect in the dual field theory .",
    "the non - equilibrium shift in the pole should be determined solely by the infrared behavior .",
    "for example , if the temperature fluctuates , so should the thermal mass .",
    "this gives a good justification of our prescrition .",
    "our general expression ( [ nshift ] ) shows that the pole of the resummed non - equilibrium propagator can depend also on the velocity and shear - stress perturbations also .",
    "it is evident from ( [ nshift ] ) that @xmath517 will be comoving with the relaxational mode constituting the non - equilibrium state ( or the dual quasinormal mode ) as below : @xmath520 furthermore , @xmath521 will have a consistent expansion in the derivative / amplitude expansion which follows from that of @xmath522 .",
    "for example , in the case of the hydrodynamic shear wave background @xmath523 takes the form : @xmath524 up to first order in the derivative expansion .",
    "we thus explicitly see in the above example how our holographic prescription gives the non - equilibrium shift in the quasi - particle pole parametrized in terms of the background velocity perturbation .",
