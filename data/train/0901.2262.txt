    "the astronomical observations over the past decade imply that our universe is currently dominated by dark energy that leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the combined analysis of cosmological observations suggests that the universe is spatially flat and consists of about @xmath6 dark energy , @xmath7 dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation .",
    "although we can affirm that the ultimate fate of the universe is determined by the feature of dark energy , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain enigmatic at present ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", we still can propose some candidates to interpret or describe the properties of dark energy .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath8 @xcite , which always suffers from the `` fine - tuning '' and `` cosmic coincidence '' puzzles .",
    "the fine - tuning problem asks why the vacuum energy density today is so small compared to typical particle scales .",
    "the vacuum energy density is of order @xmath9 , which appears to require the introduction of a new mass scale 14 or so orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "the second difficulty , the cosmic coincidence problem , says : since the energy densities of vacuum energy and dark matter scale so differently during the expansion history of the universe , why are they nearly equal today ? to get this coincidence , it appears that their ratio must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the very early universe .",
    "theorists have made lots of efforts to try to resolve the cosmological - constant problem , but all of these efforts turned out to be unsuccessful .",
    "numerous other candidates for dark energy have also been proposed in the literature , such as an evolving canonical scalar field @xcite usually referred to as quintessence , the phantom energy @xcite with an equation of state smaller than @xmath10 violating the weak energy condition , the quintom energy @xcite with an equation of state evolving across @xmath10 , and so forth .",
    "actually , the cosmological - constant ( or dark energy ) problem is in essence an issue of quantum gravity because the cosmological constant ( or the dark energy density ) is inevitably related to the vacuum expectation value of some quantum fields within the cosmological context .",
    "therefore , in principle , we can not entirely understand the nature of dark energy before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established .",
    "however , although we are lacking a quantum gravity theory today , we still can make some attempts to probe the nature of dark energy according to some principles of quantum gravity . by far",
    ", the holographic principle is widely believed as a fundamental principle for the theory of quantum gravity that is being established .",
    "hence , it is believed that the holographic principle may play a significant role in shedding light on the nature of the cosmological constant/ dark energy .",
    "currently , an interesting attempt for probing the nature of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity is the so - called `` holographic dark energy '' proposal @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the holographic principle is an important result of the recent research for exploring the quantum gravity ( or string theory ) @xcite .",
    "this principle is enlightened by investigations of the quantum property of black holes . in a quantum gravity system ,",
    "the conventional local quantum field theory will break down because it contains too many degrees of freedom that will lead to the formation of a black hole breaking the effectiveness of the quantum field theory . to reconcile this breakdown with the success of local quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology",
    ", some authors proposed a relationship between the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) cutoffs due to the limit set by the formation of a black hole .",
    "the uv - ir relation in turn provides an upper bound on the zero - point energy density . in other words , if the quantum zero - point energy density @xmath11 is relevant to an uv cutoff , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath12 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , and thus we have @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the maximum entropy is of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle @xcite is viewed as dark energy , usually dubbed holographic dark energy ( its density is denoted as @xmath15 hereafter ) .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath12 is chosen by saturating the inequality so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a numerical constant , and @xmath18 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "if we take @xmath12 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble radius @xmath19 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result .",
    "however , if one takes the hubble scale as the ir cutoff , the holographic dark energy seems not to be cable of leading to an accelerating universe .",
    "the possibilities of the particle and the event horizons as the ir cutoff were subsequently discussed by li @xcite , and it was found that only the event horizon acting as the ir cutoff can give a viable holographic dark energy leading to an accelerating universe . the holographic dark energy model based on the event horizon as the ir cutoff has been widely studied @xcite and found to be consistent with the observational data @xcite .",
    "although the holographic model based on the event horizon is successful in fitting the current observational data , the model is suffering from some serious conceptual problems . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the event horizon may lead to an obvious drawback concerning the causality . since the event horizon is a global concept of space - time , and",
    "the density of dark energy is , however , a local quantity , a question naturally arises : why should a local quantity be determined by a global one ?",
    "in addition , the event horizon is determined by the future evolution of the universe , leading to a puzzle of why the current density of dark energy is determined by the future evolution of the universe rather than the past of the universe . moreover",
    ", the future event horizon can exist only under the condition that the future evolution of the universe is always in an acceleration phase , and thus it appears that a causality problem is encountered , posting a challenge to the model .    to avoid the causality problem ,",
    "it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the age of the universe can be chosen as the length measure , instead of the horizon distance of the universe . in this case , by combining the general relativity and the uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics , the energy density of quantum fluctuations of space - time can be viewed as dark energy , and this model is consistent with the observational data provided that the unique parameter is taken to be a number of order unity .",
    "a new version of this model replacing the age of the universe by the conformal time of the universe was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to avoid some internal inconsistencies in the original model . for further studies on this model , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , inspired by the above ideas on the holographic dark energy , gao _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite proposed to consider another interesting possibility : the length scale , namely , the ir cutoff , in the holographic model may be given by the average radius of the ricci scalar curvature @xmath20 , so in this case the density of the holographic dark energy is @xmath21 .",
    "this is the so - called `` holographic ricci dark energy '' model .",
    "see also , e.g. , @xcite , for extensive studies .",
    "the studies on its phenomenological properties show that this model works fairly well in explaining the observations such as the cosmic acceleration , and it could also help to understand the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "the model is free of the causality problem and the age problem that plague the holographic model based on the future event horizon .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the physical motivation for the ricci model is still obscure in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , however , cai , hu , and zhang @xcite investigated the causal entropy bound in the holographic framework , providing us with an appropriate physical motivation for the holographic ricci dark energy . the causal entropy bound for a spatial region in a cosmological",
    "setting is given by assuming that the maximal black hole in the universe is formed by gravitational collapse with the `` jeans '' scale of perturbations , beyond which the black hole can not form very likely .",
    "therefore , the jeans scale of perturbations in the universe gives a causal connection scale @xmath22 that is naturally to be chosen as an ir cutoff in the holographic setup .",
    "for gravitational perturbations , @xmath23 for a flat universe .",
    "it turns out that only the case with the choice @xmath24 ( proportional to the ricci scalar @xmath25 of the friedmann - robertson - walker space - time in this case ) , could be consistent with the current cosmological observations .    like the li model of the holographic dark energy , the main characteristic of the holographic ricci dark energy is also governed by the numerical parameter @xmath17 in the model .",
    "in particular , when @xmath26 , the holographic ricci dark energy will exhibit a quintomlike behavior ; i.e. , its equation of state will evolve across the cosmological - constant boundary @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 can be determined only by observations .",
    "thus , in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe , it is of extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter @xmath17 by using the observational data . note that hereafter we will use the redefined parameter @xmath0 with @xmath27 as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use the observational data currently available to constrain the parameters in the model of holographic ricci dark energy .",
    "on the other hand , the scalar - field dark energy models are often viewed as an effective description of the underlying theory of dark energy .",
    "however , the underlying theory of dark energy can not be achieved before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established .",
    "we can , nevertheless , speculate on the underlying theory of dark energy by taking some principles of quantum gravity into account .",
    "the holographic models of dark energy are no doubt tentative in this way .",
    "we are now interested in , if we assume the holographic ricci vacuum energy scenario as the underlying theory of dark energy , how the scalar - field model can be used to effectively describe it",
    ". we will also address this issue in light of the fitting results to the observational data .",

[ sec : reconstruct ] , we discuss the issue of the reconstruction of the scalar - field dark energy model from the observations , according to the scenario of the holographic ricci vacuum energy . finally , we give the concluding remarks in sec .  [",
    "sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the model of the holographic ricci dark energy .",
    "we first consider the general case with an arbitrary spatial geometry in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , and then in practice we focus only on the spatially flat case as motivated by the inflation .",
    "consider the frw universe with the metric @xmath28 where @xmath29 , 0 , @xmath10 for closed , flat , and open geometries , respectively , and @xmath30 is the scale factor of the universe with the convention @xmath31 .",
    "the friedmann equation is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter , the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath34 , and the summation runs over various cosmic components .",
    "if we focus only on the late - time evolution of the universe , the radiation component @xmath35 is negligible , and then the cosmic contents include the matter component @xmath36 and the dark energy component @xmath15 .",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath37 determines , as suggested by gao _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite , the density of dark energy : @xmath38 where @xmath0 is a positive numerical constant to be determined by observations . comparing to eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) , we see that if we identify @xmath39 with @xmath40 , we have @xmath27 .",
    "this is the so - called holographic ricci dark energy model .",
    "this model was originally viewed as lacking physical reasoning @xcite .",
    "thanks to the work of cai _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , the ricci model gets an appropriate physical mechanism or reasoning for which such a dark energy could be motivated . assuming the maximal black hole in the universe is formed through gravitational collapse of perturbations in the universe , then the jeans scale of the perturbations gives a causal connection scale @xmath22 that is naturally to be chosen as an ir cutoff in the holographic setup . for gravitational perturbations , @xmath23 for a flat universe .",
    "it turns out that only the case with the choice @xmath24 ( proportional to the ricci scalar @xmath25 of the frw space - time in this case ) could be consistent with the current cosmological observations .",
    "so , the ricci dark energy can be viewed as originating from taking the causal connection scale as the ir cutoff in the holographic setting .",
    "now the friedmann equation can be rewritten as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and the subscript `` 0 '' denotes the present values of various variables , hereafter .",
    "this equation can be further rewritten in the following form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . solving this equation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an integration constant . using the initial condition @xmath49 , the integration constant @xmath48",
    "is determined as @xmath50    in eq .",
    "( [ ea ] ) , it is easy to identify the contribution of dark energy ( the last two terms on the right hand side ) ; consequently , we can define @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the present critical density of the universe . from this expression",
    ", one can see that the parameter @xmath0 plays a significant role for the evolution of the ricci dark energy .",
    "when @xmath53 , the equation of state of dark energy will evolve in the region of @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath55 is chosen , the behavior of the holographic ricci dark energy will be more and more like a cosmological constant with the expansion of the universe , such that ultimately the universe will enter the de sitter phase in the far future .",
    "when @xmath1 , the holographic ricci dark energy will exhibit a quintomlike evolution behavior ( for `` quintom '' dark energy , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. , the equation of state of holographic ricci dark energy will evolve across the cosmological - constant boundary @xmath2 ( actually , it evolves from the region with @xmath56 to that with @xmath57 ) .",
    "that is to say , the choice of @xmath1 makes the ricci dark energy today behave as a phantom energy that leads to a cosmic doomsday ( `` big rip '' ) in the future .",
    "thus , as discussed above , the value of @xmath0 determines the destiny of the universe in the holographic ricci dark energy model . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ rdet ] ) , one can easily infer that the ricci dark energy could track the evolution of the nonrelativistic matter in the early times , which can help to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem .     and show the cases for @xmath58 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 .",
    "clearly , the cases with @xmath59 behave like a quintessence , and the cases with @xmath1 behave like a quintom . ]     and @xmath60 .",
    "also , we plot the cases for @xmath61 and @xmath58 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 . at first sight",
    ", one finds that at early times of roughly @xmath62 the density contribution of dark energy can occupy roughly @xmath63 .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that in this epoch the dark energy behaves like dust matter , so , effectively speaking , the matter density contribution is still @xmath64 , namely , @xmath65 . ]    of course , one can also derive the usual fractional density of dark energy , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "furthermore , from the energy conservation equation @xmath68 , one can obtain the equation of state for ricci dark energy @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the redshift .    since the current observations strongly favor a spatially flat universe that is also supported by the inflation theory , hereafter the discussions will be restricted to the case of @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) .",
    "as illustrative examples , we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : wz ] and [ fig : omegaz ] the selected evolutions of the holographic ricci dark energy .",

    "also , at early times , roughly @xmath62 , the equation of state of the ricci dark energy approaches 0 ; i.e. , in this model the dark energy behaves like dust matter during most of the epoch of matter domination .",

    "however , when considering the holographic property of gravity , the uv regime is related to the ir regime .",
    "thanks to the uv - ir relation , the dark energy problem can be converted to an ir problem . this is the key point of the holographic dark energy proposal .",
    "in this view , the uv - ir relation provides an upper bound on the zero - point energy ( vacuum energy ) density , and consequently the vacuum energy becomes a dynamical dark energy .",
    "actually , the dynamical dark energy scenario is an alternative proposal to the cosmological - constant scenario .",
    "the dynamical dark energy proposal is often realized by some scalar field mechanism which suggests that the energy form with negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving down a proper potential .",
    "actually , this mechanism is enlightened to a great extent by the inflationary cosmology .",
    "as we have known , the occurrence of the current accelerating expansion of the universe is not the first time for the expansion history of the universe .",
    "there is significant observational evidence strongly supporting that the universe underwent an early inflationary epoch , over sufficiently small time scales , during which its expansion rapidly accelerated under the drive of an `` inflaton '' field which had properties similar to those of a cosmological constant . the inflaton field , to some extent , can be viewed as a kind of dynamically evolving dark energy .",
    "hence , the scalar - field models involving a minimally coupled scalar field are proposed , inspired by inflationary cosmology , to construct dynamically evolving models of dark energy . the only difference between the dynamical scalar - field dark energy and the inflaton is the energy scale that they possess .",
    "famous examples of scalar - field dark energy models include quintessence @xcite , @xmath149-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , phantom @xcite , ghost condensate @xcite and two - field quintom @xcite , and so forth .    generically , there are two points of view on the scalar - field models of dynamical dark energy .",
    "one viewpoint regards the scalar field as a fundamental field of the nature .",
    "the nature of dark energy is , according to this viewpoint , completely attributed to some fundamental scalar field which is omnipresent in supersymmetric field theories and in string / m theory .",
    "the other viewpoint supports that the scalar - field model is an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy . on the whole",
    ", it seems that the latter is the mainstream point of view .",
    "since we regard the scalar field model as an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy , a question arises : what is the underlying theory of the dark energy ?",
    "of course , hitherto , this question is far beyond our present knowledge , because we can not entirely understand the nature of dark energy before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established .",
    "although we are lacking a quantum gravity theory today , we can , nevertheless , speculate on the underlying theory of dark energy by taking some principles of quantum gravity into account .",
    "needless to say , the holographic models of dark energy are an interesting tentative in this way .",
    "since the holographic principle is taken into account , the holographic models possess some significant features of an underlying theory of dark energy . now",
    ", we are interested in , if we assume the holographic ricci dark energy as the underlying theory of dark energy , how the scalar - field model can be used to describe it . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we have constrained the holographic ricci dark energy model using the latest observational data .",
    "hence , in turn , if there is a low - energy effective scalar - field describing the ricci dark energy , the scalar - field model can be reconstructed in light of the constraint results from the observations .",
    "for the works in this way , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the nomenclature quintom is suggested in the sense that its behavior resembles the combined behavior of quintessence and phantom .",
    "thus , a simple realization of a quintom scenario is a model with the double fields of quintessence and phantom @xcite .",
    "the cosmological evolution of such a model has been investigated in detail .",
    "it should be noted that such a quintom model would typically encounter the problem of quantum instability inherited from the phantom component .    for the single real scalar - field models , the transition of crossing @xmath10 for @xmath77 can occur for the lagrangian density @xmath150 , where x is a kinematic term of a scalar - field @xmath151 , in which @xmath152 changes sign from positive to negative , and thus we require nonlinear terms in @xmath153 to realize the @xmath2 crossing @xcite .",
    "when adding a high derivative term to the kinetic term @xmath153 in the single - scalar - field model , the energy - momentum tensor is proven to be equivalent to that of a two - field quintom model @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is remarkable that the generalized ghost condensate model of a single real scalar field is a successful realization of the quintomlike dark energy @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a dark energy model with a ghost scalar field has been explored in the context of the runaway dilaton scenario in low - energy effective string theory .",
    "the authors addressed for the dilatonic ghost condensate model the problem of vacuum stability by implementing higher - order derivative terms and showed that a cosmological model of quintomlike dark energy can be constructed without violating the stability of quantum fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , a generalized ghost condensate model was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite by means of the cosmological reconstruction program . in what follows",
    "we will focus on the generalized ghost condensate model .",
    "we shall use this scalar field model to effectively describe the holographic ricci dark energy , and perform the reconstruction for such a scalar model . for",
    "the reconstruction of dark energy models , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "first , let us consider the lagrangian density of a general scalar field @xmath150 , where @xmath154 is the kinetic energy term .",
    "note that @xmath150 is a general function of @xmath151 and @xmath153 , and we have used a sign notation @xmath155 . identifying the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field with that of a perfect fluid",
    ", we can easily derive the energy density @xmath156 , where @xmath157 .",
    "thus , in a spatially flat frw universe , the dynamic equations for the scalar field are @xmath158 @xmath159 where @xmath160 in the cosmological context . here",
    "we have used the unit @xmath161 for convenience .",
    "also , for convenience , we introduce the quantity @xmath162 .",
    "we find from eqs .",
    "( [ hsqr ] ) and ( [ hdot ] ) that @xmath163h_0 ^ 2,\\label{p}\\ ] ] @xmath164 where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath165 .",
    "the equation of state for dark energy is given by @xmath166 next , if we establish a correspondence between the holographic ricci vacuum energy and the scalar field dark energy , we should choose a scalar - field model in which crossing the cosmological - constant boundary is possible .",
    "so , let us consider the generalized ghost condensate model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the lagrangian density @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a function in terms of @xmath151 .",
    "the dilatonic ghost condensate model @xcite corresponds to a choice @xmath169 . from eqs .  ( [ p ] ) and ( [ px ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath170 @xmath171 where @xmath172 represents the present critical density of the universe .",
    "the generalized ghost condensate describes the holographic ricci vacuum energy , provided that @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    ", in units of @xmath175 , corresponding to the joint analysis results of snia , cmb , and bao observations .",
    "the central black solid line represents the best fit , and the red dotted area covers the range of @xmath176 errors .",
    "the errors are calculated using a monte carlo method . ]    in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we have derived cosmological constraints on the holographic ricci dark energy model from the joint analysis of snia , cmb , and bao observations .",
    "now , one can reconstruct the function @xmath168 for the generalized ghost condensate model in light of the holographic ricci dark energy and the corresponding fit results of the observational constraints .",
    "the reconstruction for @xmath168 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : hphi ] , using the 1@xmath3 fit results from the joint analysis of snia , cmb , and bao observations . in this figure",
    ", the central black solid line represents the best fit , and the red dotted area around the best fit covers the range of 1@xmath3 errors .",
    "the errors quoted in fig .  [ fig : hphi ] are calculated using a monte carlo method where random points are chosen in the 1@xmath3 region of the parameter space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field @xmath177 is also determined by the reconstruction program ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phiz ] ) in which we have fixed the field amplitude at the present epoch ( @xmath178 ) to be zero : @xmath179 .",
    "in addition , the reconstructed evolution of @xmath180 is also shown in fig .  [ fig : hz ] . note that the errors quoted in figs .",
    "[ fig : phiz ] and [ fig : hz ] are calculated using the fisher matrix approach .    , in units of the planck mass @xmath181 (",
    "note that here the planck normalization @xmath161 has been used ) , corresponding to the joint analysis results of snia , cmb , and bao observations . ]    , in units of @xmath175 , corresponding to the joint analysis results of snia , cmb , and bao observations . ]",
    "the crossing of the cosmological - constant boundary corresponds to @xmath182 .",
    "the system can enter the phantom region ( @xmath183 ) without discontinuous behavior of @xmath84 and @xmath153 .",
    "in addition , as has been pointed out by tsujikawa @xcite , it should be cautioned that the perturbation of the field @xmath151 is plagued by a quantum instability whenever it behaves as a phantom @xcite . even at the classical level ,",
    "the perturbation becomes unstable for @xmath184 , because the speed of sound @xmath185 will become negative .",
    "this instability may be avoided if the phantom behavior is just transient .",
    "in fact the dilatonic ghost condensate model can realize a transient phantom behavior ( see , e.g. , fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "the cosmological - constant boundary crossing occurs again in the future , after which the perturbation will become stable .",
    "nevertheless , one may argue that the field can be regarded as an effective one so as to evade problems such as stability .",
    "in particular , the present focus is how to establish a dynamical scalar - field model on a phenomenological level to describe the possible underlying theory of dark energy , disregarding whether the field is fundamental or not .",
    "the cosmic acceleration observed by distance - redshift relation measurement of snia strongly supports the existence of dark energy .",
    "the fantastic physical property of dark energy not only drives the current cosmic acceleration , but also determines the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "however , hitherto , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin still remain enigmatic for us .",
    "though the underlying theory of dark energy is still far beyond our knowledge , it is guessed that the quantum gravity theory shall play a significant role in resolving the dark energy enigma .",
    "therefore , one can try to probe the nature of dark energy according to some principles of quantum gravity . by far , the holographic principle is widely believed as a fundamental principle for the theory of quantum gravity .",
    "so , the holographic models of dark energy become an important attempt for exploring dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity .",
    "it is believed that the holographic models possess some significant features of an underlying theory of dark energy .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the model of holographic ricci dark energy that can be viewed as originating from taking the causal connection scale as the ir cutoff in the holographic setting .",
    "the main characteristic of holographic ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter @xmath0 in the model .",
    "in particular , when @xmath1 , the holographic ricci dark energy will exhibit a quintomlike behavior ; i.e. , its equation of state will evolve across the cosmological - constant boundary @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 can be determined only by observations .",
    "thus , in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe , it is of extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter @xmath0 by using the observational data .",
    "we have derived , in this paper , the constraints on the holographic ricci dark energy model from the latest observational data including the 307 union sample of snia , the cmb shift parameter given by wmap5 , and the bao measurement from sdss .",
    "the joint analysis gives the best - fit results ( with 1@xmath3 confidence level ) : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "that is to say , according to the observations , the holographic ricci dark energy takes on a quintom feature .",
    "if we regard the scalar - field model as an effective description of such a theory ( holographic ricci vacuum energy ) , we should be capable of using the scalar - field model to mimic the evolving behavior of the dynamical vacuum energy and reconstructing this scalar - field model according to the evolutionary behavior of holographic ricci dark energy and the fits to the observational data sets .",
    "we find the generalized ghost condensate model is a good choice for depicting the holographic ricci vacuum energy , since it can easily realize the quintom behavior .",
    "we thus reconstructed the function @xmath168 of the generalized ghost condensate model using the fit results of the observational data ( snia + cmb + bao ) .",
    "we hope that the future high precision observations ( e.g. , the supernova acceleration probe ) may be capable of determining the fine property of the dark energy and consequently reveal some significant features of the underlying theory of dark energy .",

    "<S> in this work , we consider the cosmological constraints on the holographic ricci dark energy proposed by gao _ et  al . _ </S>",

    "<S> d 79 , 043511 ( 2009 ) ] , by using the observational data currently available . </S>",
    "<S> the main characteristic of holographic ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter @xmath0 in the model . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 , the holographic ricci dark energy will exhibit a quintomlike behavior ; i.e. , its equation of state will evolve across the cosmological - constant boundary @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 can be determined only by observations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe , it is of extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter @xmath0 by using the observational data . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we derive constraints on the holographic ricci dark energy model from the latest observational data including the union sample of 307 type ia supernovae , the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background given by the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe observations , and the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> the joint analysis gives the best - fit results ( with 1@xmath3 uncertainty ) : @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , according to the observations , the holographic ricci dark energy takes on the quintom feature . finally , in light of the results of the cosmological constraints </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the issue of the scalar - field dark energy reconstruction , based on the scenario of the holographic ricci vacuum energy . </S>"
