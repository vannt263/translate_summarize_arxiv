    "the scattering of light can induce a polarization to an otherwise unpolarized photon flux . in the case of asteroids ,",
    "the dust and regolith on the surface act to instill a linear polarization on the reflected sunlight .",
    "the degree of this polarization changes with phase angle , albedo , spectral type , and surface composition @xcite . while single - particle scattering will always result in polarization perpendicular to the scattering plane ( `` positive '' polarization ) , polarization in the scattering plane ( `` negative '' polarization )",
    "is observed for very small phase angles for a wide range of objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "@xcite present a review of possible physical causes of this effect , the most promising of which are coherent backscattering models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which also can describe the photometric opposition effect .    in this paper ,",
    "we determine the effects of different size distributions of surface dust on the observed relationship between the polarization of the reflected light and the phase angle of the asteroid ( that is , the sun - asteroid - earth angle ) . a variety of processes can cause dust loss on asteroids .",
    "electrostatic charging of surface dust particles by solar radiation , for example , can levitate smaller particles meters above the surface ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) . for small bodies",
    "these effects will result in the preferential loss of the smallest dust grains , effectively truncating the original dust size distribution . here",
    "we test six cases of small near - earth asteroids ( neas ) , for which the dust loss should be more pronounced , and measure the effect of dust loss on the polarization - phase relation .",
    "the surfaces of most atmosphereless bodies in the inner solar system are composed of a loose regolith ranging in size from dust to boulders . on the moon",
    "the smallest particles are dust down to @xmath2 m in size @xcite while for smaller asteroids such as ( 25143 ) itokawa the regolith appears significantly coarser , with an apparent lack of anything smaller than @xmath3 mm @xcite . with a surface gravity",
    "significantly higher than all but the few largest asteroids , the dust distribution on the moon sets a strong lower - limit on the dust particle sizes we will consider in this study . as we will show in   [ pol ] , the polarization - phase relation is insensitive to the upper - limit of the grain size distribution as long as that limit is @xmath4 m .",
    "dust particles lofted from the surface of an asteroid by micro - meteoroid bombardment or electrostatic levitation are immediately subject to solar radiation pressure effects .",
    "this pressure can put the particle into orbit around the parent body or allow the particle to escape into a heliocentric orbit .",
    "a lofted particle s motion can be described by eq  [ eq : eom ] which includes the effects of both gravity due to the asteroid ( where @xmath5 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath6 the mass of the asteroid , and @xmath7 the position vector of the particle in @xmath8 space ) and solar radiation pressure ( @xmath9 ) . the radiation pressure is assumed to act in the anti - sun direction , @xmath10 , with no time dependency ( i.e. the x - axis corresponds to the sun - asteroid line and the orbit of the asteroid around the sun is not included in this approximation ) .",
    "the solar radiation pressure is described by eq  [ eq : g ] , where @xmath11 is the albedo of the particle ( assumed to be zero initially ) , @xmath12 is a constant of solar radiation ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the mass - to - area ratio of the particle , and @xmath15 is the distance to the sun .",
    "the motion of the particle can then be described by the potential given in eq  [ eq : u ] .",
    "@xmath16    a mathematical analysis of the orbital dynamics of test particles at an asteroid has been carried out previously by several authors .",
    "@xcite developed a precise limit on semi - major axis of an orbiting particle under the assumption that the asteroid was stationary .",
    "@xcite incorporated the motion of the asteroid about the sun and developed a sufficient condition on semi - major axis for a particle ( in this case a spacecraft ) to be trapped in orbit about a small body . @xcite",
    "combined elements of these two earlier studies to derive more precise limits on semi - major axis of an orbiting test particle accounting for its motion . for purposes of this paper",
    "the analysis in @xcite is too detailed to be summarized simply , and thus we will only restate the results of these earlier papers .    from the analysis by @xcite we find that a simple limit exists for the semi - major axis of a lofted particle that generally ensures escape from the small body if exceeded . mapped into our notation we find that escape will occur if the semi - major axis is larger than @xmath17 : @xmath18 assuming an albedo of @xmath19 .",
    "using a very different approach , @xcite developed a sufficient condition for stability about a small body and found that escape is not immediately possible if the semi - major axis is less than @xmath20 : @xmath21 in the general problem it is possible for the semi - major axis to evolve , but we ignore this effect for this derivation .",
    "we note that these limiting semi - major axes scale linearly with the small body distance from the sun .",
    "thus , escape is most likely to occur at perihelion .    in order to calculate the mass - to - area ratio ( @xmath14 ) of a particle",
    ", we assume that it is spherical with a circular reflective surface area , giving @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the dust density and @xmath24 is the diameter of the dust particle .",
    "note that these assumptions are conservative as spheres maximize the volume - to - area ratio , and thus these calculations provide a lower limit to the cross - sectional surface area of particles escaping .",
    "additionally , we are ignoring any timescale for particle loss once in orbit , assuming that sufficient time has passed to clear all particles in the perihelion size - limit . from this",
    "we can expand eq  [ eq : g ] to find : @xmath25    substituting eq  [ eq : gexpanded ] into eq  [ eq : aescape ] and assuming that the particle of interest rests on the asteroid s surface ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the asteroid s diameter ) , we can develop an expression that relates the minimum particle size expected to be found on an asteroid s surface to the physical characteristics of the asteroid : @xmath28    equation  [ eq : rd ] shows that as the size of the central body decreases or as perihelion distance becomes smaller , the minimum surface particle size increases .",
    "this can be seen in fig  [ fig.trend ] , which shows with thick lines the relationship given in eq  [ eq : rd ] ( normalized by the central body diameter ) assuming the central body and the dust particle have the same density and an albedo of @xmath29 .",
    "we note that dust should have densities up to a factor of @xmath30 more than the bulk asteroid density , however this is mitigated by the assumption of spherical shapes for particle size . for asteroids spinning near their disruption rate",
    "we can assume that @xmath31 , resulting in a minimum particle size that is a factor of four larger than predicted by eq  [ eq : rd ] .",
    "table  [ tab : examples ] shows the particle size limit for ( 433 ) eros and itokawa , ignoring any rotation .",
    "note that the minimum particle size is inversely related to the asteroid density , diameter and distance from the sun .",
    "if we consider the migration of itokawa from the main belt to its current location , we see that as the asteroid approaches the sun , increasingly larger particles are able to escape .",
    "if the polarization of light reflected from an asteroid is dependent on the size of the particles on the surface we would expect neas to show changes in their polarization - phase curve as a function of the predicted particle size .",
    "the coherent backscatter mechanism , a second order light - scattering effect , has been shown to be the dominant cause of both the observed polarization signature of light reflected from asteroids at small phase angles as well as the photometric opposition effect @xcite .",
    "as phase angle increases this transitions to a regime dominated by first - order single - particle scattering . using numerical techniques to calculate the scattering of individual surface elements ,",
    "@xcite find that the polarization of the light can be approximated as : @xmath32 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the percent polarization , @xmath34 is the phase angle in radians , @xmath35 is the index of refraction , @xmath36 is the wave number , and @xmath37 is the scatter separation distance .",
    "this assumes a single spacing for all scattering particles .",
    "other recent models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have assumed two discrete scattering components co - mixed at different weightings to fit observed polarization phase curves .    in this work",
    "we will instead consider a continuous distribution of grain spacings .",
    "the distribution of voids in a silicate glass follows an approximate power - law falloff for sizes beyond some critical peak void size @xcite .",
    "we begin by assuming that the spacing between dust on an asteroid s surface also follows a power law , and that the voids have the same minimum and maximum characteristic sizes as the dust .",
    "this implies that chemical and mineralogical effects are fully incorporated into the size of the constituent grains , which we discuss further in   [ conc ] .",
    "@xcite show that for their model nea population the size distribution is fit by the power law @xmath38 for sizes from @xmath39 m to @xmath40 cm . using a large - area camera network ,",
    "@xcite find that the mass distribution of fireballs ( @xmath41 kg ) entering the earth s atmosphere has an exponential power between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , translating to a size distribution power between @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "we focus on this range of size distribution powers for our simulations .    by integrating eq  [ eq.p1d ] over all grain sizes from @xmath46 to @xmath47",
    "we obtain : @xmath48 } \\bar{d}^p\\,d\\bar{d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a variable used to fit the depth of the negative polarization , @xmath50 is the exponential power of the grain - size distribution , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are minimum and maximum sizes of the grain - size distribution in microns , respectively .",
    "if we consider only a single wavelength ( in this case @xmath51 nm , meaning @xmath52m@xmath53 ) we find that the arbitrary variable @xmath49 reduces to a simple expression of @xmath46 , giving : @xmath54 } \\bar{d}^p\\,d\\bar{d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    figure  [ fig.model]a shows the change in the polarization - phase relation for fixed @xmath35 , @xmath46 and @xmath50 .",
    "as @xmath47 increases its effect on the curve diminishes , meaning that the polarization is insensitive to the largest particle size for general distributions .",
    "for all other simulations we fix the maximum particle size at @xmath55 m to limit computation time . in fig  [",
    "fig.model]b we plot the effects of a variable @xmath46 .",
    "as a normalizing agent , @xmath46 has a strong effect on the slope of the relation beyond the inversion angle ( the point at which the polarization - phase curve recovers to zero ) , but also on the shape and depth of the negative branch of polarization .",
    "a variable index of refraction most significantly affects the location of the inversion angle @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig.model]c small changes in the index of refraction result in major changes to the inversion angle and depth of negative polarization , with only minor effects on the slope or shape of the negative branch . finally , the effect of variations in the power of the size distribution are shown in fig  [ fig.model]d . for the ranges of powers considered",
    "there are only minor changes to the slope and inversion angle , and only in the extreme case is there a significant change to the negative polarization branch .",
    "from eq  [ eq.palldclean ] we can calculate the properties of the polarization - phase relation in terms of physical constants only .",
    "we find that the slope for @xmath57 is described by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the slope ( in percent polarization per degree ) .",
    "as @xmath47 becomes large ( @xmath60 m ) it s effect on @xmath59 becomes negligible .",
    "similarly , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 m we can describe the location of the inversion angle approximately as : @xmath63 where @xmath56 is the inversion angle in radians .",
    "@xcite derive updated constants for the relationship between polarization slope @xmath59 and geometric albedo @xmath11 : @xmath64 using eq  [ eq.slope ] and assuming that @xmath65 m we can now describe the geometric albedo of an asteroid as : @xmath66",
    "in order to test the effect of dust depletion on the polarization of small neas , we conducted observations of four targets over a five week period at the end of 2008 using the dual - beam imaging polarimeter ( dbip ) on the university of hawaii s 2.2  m telescope @xcite",
    ". dbip is designed to measure both linear and circular polarizations of asteroids and other point sources at magnitudes @xmath67 with errors less than @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "targets were chosen from all small neas ( @xmath0 km ) that would be brighter than @xmath69 over the observing window .",
    "four asteroids had polarimetric measurements of sufficient quality to compare with the theory discussed above .",
    "asteroids ( 85236 ) , ( 142348 ) , ( 162900 ) and 2006 sz@xmath70 were measured at a range of phase angles sufficient to determine both @xmath56 and @xmath59 .",
    "table  [ tab.obs ] gives the target name , ut date of observation , apparent @xmath71 magnitude , exposure time , number of exposures , solar phase angle @xmath34 , measured linear polarization , and angle of polarization referenced to the vector orthogonal to the sun - object - earth scattering plane .    in table",
    "[ tab.dust ] we present for each asteroid the fitted inversion angle and slope ( considering only phase angles @xmath72 ) as well as perihelion distance ( q ) , absolute magnitude ( h@xmath73 ) , albedo ( as calculated from eq  [ eq.albedo ] ) , diameter ( d ) , @xmath35 and @xmath46 calculated from eqs  [ eq.slope ] and [ eq.a0 ] ( assuming @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , and the range of predicted minimum particle sizes remaining on the surface ( @xmath76 ) depending on the assumed density ( between @xmath77 and @xmath78 g  @xmath79 ) following   [ grainsize ] . included in the table",
    "are the same values for eros @xcite and itokawa @xcite , two neas that have been extensively studied both remotely as well as _ in situ _ by spacecraft visits .",
    "a measured density for each of these objects @xcite allows us to make a singular prediction for minimum surface particle size .",
    "the @xmath76 range or value for each of the six asteroids is shown in fig  [ fig.trend ] . scaling the levitation calculations from @xcite to smaller asteroids",
    "we find our predicted minimum particle sizes are within the range of particle sizes that are capable of being levitated , assuming the particle s surface electric potential is equal to that of the asteroid s surface .",
    "figure  [ fig.polplot ] shows our observations and fits for each asteroid , as well as for the literature data for itokawa and eros . note that the fits for 2006 sz@xmath70 and ( 85236 ) are under - constrained , thus values for the slope have large errors and the inversion angles are only approximate . in all cases , the polarization - phase relation beyond @xmath56",
    "was assumed to be strictly linear .",
    "calculations of the dust retention for the neas investigated predict over two orders of magnitude in variation of the minimum particle size .",
    "we find no correlation in our data between the @xmath46 calculated from our measured slope and the predicted minimum particle size . if the individual dust particles were unique scattering elements we would expect the opposite to be true .",
    "thus the physical size of the dust can not be the primary cause of polarization or even a significant contributor .",
    "in fact , ( 85236 ) , ( 162900 ) , 2006 sz@xmath70 , itokawa and eros all show slopes and inversion angles consistent with those measured for large s - type main belt asteroids ( mbas ) , while ( 142348 ) shows polarization similar to what is seen for large c - type mbas ( see , e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from this",
    "we infer that the polarization of light reflected from an asteroid is constrained primarily by the way the local mineralogy and chemistry dictate the formation of spaces in the mineral matrix .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath46 then represents not the size of the smallest particle on the surface , but instead a characteristic minimum size of mineralogical voids . for asteroids with similar spectral signatures , and",
    "thus similar surface chemistries , we expect to see correspondingly similar polarization properties .",
    "asteroid polarization - phase curves should show no variation with changing regolith conditions for asteroids of the same composition .",
    "the polarization - albedo relation ( eq  [ eq.albedo ] ) then does not depend on surface regolith size distribution and so is identical for neas and mbas .",
    "variations in surface regolith and observing geometries between neas and mbas require thermal models tailored for each population @xcite which in turn affects infrared albedo determinations .",
    "polarimetrically determined albedos are therefore immune to this complication and can be robustly applied to any asteroid regardless of location in the solar system .",
    "through modeling of the effects of a distribution of spacings between scattering elements on the observed polarization - phase relation , we have shown that the relation is independent of the size of the particles on the surface .",
    "instead , the slope of the relation beyond the inversion angle ( and thus the spacing parameter @xmath37 ) remains constant for a range of objects with dust - retention sizes spanning two orders of magnitude .",
    "the polarization - phase relation is therefore consistent between mbas and neas of the same spectral type .",
    "an asteroid s surface chemistry and mineralogy are the dominant cause of the polarization - phase relation , and this relation is equally applicable for both neas and mbas .",
