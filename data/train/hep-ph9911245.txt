    "processes involving flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) provide invaluable guidelines for supersymmetric model building .",
    "the experimental measurements of the rates for these processes , or the upper limits set on them , impose in general a reduction of the large number and size of parameters in the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms present in these models . among these processes , those involving transitions between first- and second - generation quarks , namely fcnc processes in the @xmath5 system , are considered as the most formidable tools to shape viable supersymmetric flavour models .",
    "moreover , the tight experimental bounds on some flavour - diagonal transitions , such as the electric dipole moment of the electron and of the neutron , as well as @xmath6 , help constraining soft terms inducing chirality violations .",
    "several supersymmetric models have so far emerged , with specific solutions to the chiral - flavour problem . among them",
    "are two classes of models in which the dynamics of flavour sets in above the supersymmetry breaking scale and in which the subsequent flavour problem is killed by the mechanisms of communicating supersymmetry breaking to the experimentally accessible sector .",
    "they are known as msugra , i.e. minimal supersymmetric standard models in which supergravity is the mediator between the supersymmetry - breaking sector and the visible sector  @xcite , and gauge - mediated supersymmetry - breaking models ( gmsbs )  @xcite , in which the communication between the two sectors is realized by gauge interactions . in other classes of models ,",
    "particular flavour symmetries are introduced , which link quarks and squarks : models in which an alignment of squarks and quarks is assumed  @xcite , and models in which the solution to the flavour problem is obtained by advocating heavy first- and second - generation squarks  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the splitting between squarks of first and second generation and those belonging to the third generation relies on a @xmath7 flavour symmetry  @xcite .",
    "neutral flavour transitions involving third - generation quarks do not yet pose serious threats to these models .",
    "one exception comes from the decay @xmath8 , the least rare flavour- and chirality - violating process in the @xmath9 system .",
    "it has been detected , but the precision of the experimental measurement of its rate is not very high at the moment .",
    "nevertheless , this measurement already has the effect of carving out some regions in the space of free parameters of most of the models in the above classes ( see for example  @xcite ; for a recent analysis , see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they also drastically constrain several somewhat tuned realizations of models in these classes  @xcite . once the precision in the experimental measurement has increased",
    ", this decay will undoubtedly gain efficiency in selecting the viable regions of the parameter space in the above classes of models and it may help discriminating among the models by then proposed .",
    "it is therefore important to get ready reliable calculations of this decay rate , i.e. calculations in which theoretical uncertainties are reduced as much as possible , and which are general enough to be applied to generic supersymmetric models .",
    "the experimental situation is , at present , as follows .",
    "the aleph collaboration at lep reports a value of the inclusive decay @xmath10 of  @xcite : @xmath11 from a sample of @xmath12 hadrons at the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the cleo collaboration at cesr has a statistically and systematically more precise result , based on @xmath14 @xmath15 events  @xcite : @xmath16 but quotes a still very large interval  @xcite , @xmath17 as the range of acceptable values of branching ratios .",
    "theoretically , the rate for this decay , characterized by its large qcd contributions , practically as large as the purely electroweak ones  @xcite , is known with high accuracy in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it has been calculated up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , using the formalism of effective hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "results for lo and nlo calculations and for power corrections can be found in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the resulting theoretical accuracy is rather astonishing : the inclusion of the nlo qcd corrections reduces the large scale dependences that are present at lo ( @xmath18 ) to a mere per cent uncertainty , once the value of the parameters to be input in this calculation is fixed .",
    "this accuracy , however , is obtained through large and accidental numerical cancellations among different contributions to the nlo corrections and a subsequent cancellation of scale dependences  @xcite . the same accuracy , indeed , is not obtained for the nlo calculation of the rate @xmath19 in simple extensions of the sm , such as models that differ from the sm by the addition of two or more doublets to the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath19 within supersymmetric models is still far from this level of sophistication .",
    "there are several contributions to the amplitude of this decay , usually identified by the particles exchanged in the loop . besides the @xmath20@xmath21-quark and @xmath22@xmath21-quark contributions , there are also the chargino , gluino and neutralino contributions , respectively mediated by the exchange of chargino  up - squarks , gluino  down - squarks and neutralino  down - squarks .",
    "all these contributions were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within msugra ; their analytic expressions apply naturally to gmsb models also .",
    "the inclusion of qcd corrections needed for the calculation of the rate , was assumed in  @xcite to follow the sm pattern .",
    "no dedicated study of this decay exists for the supersymmetric models mentioned above with specific flavour symmetries .",
    "a calculation of @xmath19 induced solely by the gluino contribution has been performed in  @xcite for a generic supersymmetric model , but no qcd corrections were included .",
    "a nlo analysis of @xmath19 was recently performed  @xcite for a specific supersymmetric case ( the corresponding nlo matching conditions are also given in  @xcite ) .",
    "this is valid in a class of models where the only source of flavour violation at the electroweak scale is that of the sm , encoded in the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "it applies to msugra and gmsb models ( in which the same features are assumed / obtained at the messenger scale ) only when the amount of flavour violation , generated radiatively between the supersymmetry - breaking scale and the electroweak scale , can be neglected with respect to that induced by the ckm matrix .",
    "it applies , therefore , to the case in which only the lightest stop eigenstate contributes to the chargino - mediated loop and all other squarks and gluino are heavy enough to be decoupled at the electroweak scale .",
    "it can not be used in particular directions of parameter space of the above listed models in which quantum effects induce a gluino contribution  @xcite as large as the chargino or the sm contribution  @xcite . nor can it be used as a model - discriminator tool , able to constrain the potentially large sources of flavour violation typical of generic supersymmetric models .    among these ,",
    "flavour - violating scalar mass terms and trilinear terms induce a flavour non - diagonal vertex gluino ",
    "quark  squark .",
    "this is generically assumed to provide the dominant contributions to quark - flavour transitions thanks to its large coupling @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , it is often taken as the only contribution to these transitions  @xcite , and in particular to the @xmath24 decay , when attempting to obtain order - of - magnitude upper bounds on flavour - violating terms in the scalar potential  @xcite .",
    "once the constraints coming from experimental measurements are imposed , however , the gluino contribution is reduced to values such that the sm and the other supersymmetric contributions can no longer be neglected .",
    "any lo and nlo calculation of the @xmath0 rate in generic supersymmetric models should then include all possible contributions .",
    "the gluino contribution presents some peculiar features , related to the implementation of qcd corrections , that have not been detected so far .",
    "as already mentioned , the decay @xmath0 involves a quark - flavour violation as well as chirality violation .",
    "the first is directly related to the flavour violation in the virtual sfermions exchanged in the loop .",
    "the second can be obtained as in the sm , through a chirality flip in the external @xmath12-quark , and it is signalled by its mass @xmath25 . it can also be induced by sfermion mass terms originating from trilinear soft supersymmetry - breaking terms .",
    "these mass terms differ from fermionic mass terms by two units of @xmath26-charge under a @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "the correct @xmath26-charge for this @xmath12@xmath28 transition is then restored through the insertion of the gluino mass @xmath29 in the gluino propagator .",
    "the two different mechanisms producing chirality violation are well known .",
    "they give rise to operators of different dimensionality when generating the effective hamiltonian used to include qcd corrections to the @xmath24 decay .",
    "indeed , @xmath29 , the mass of one of the heavy fields exchanged in the loop , is naturally incorporated in the wilson coefficient of the corresponding magnetic operator , which is now of dimension @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . on the contrary , @xmath25 , the running mass of one light field , with a full dynamics below the matching scale ,",
    "is naturally included in the definition of a magnetic operator , which is of dimension @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of the strong coupling @xmath1 in the gluino contribution immediately sparks off the question of whether this coupling should be included in the definition of the gluino - induced operators or in the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "both choices are , in principle , acceptable",
    ". it can be observed , however , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ ordersplit ] , that the first option does not require a modification of the program of implementation of qcd corrections established in the sm case . in particular",
    ", the anomalous dimension matrix starts at order @xmath1 and is used up to order @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) in a lo ( nlo ) calculation .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 coupling in the operators imposes a necessary distinction of the dimension _ six _ gluino - induced magnetic operators @xmath33 from the sm magnetic operator @xmath34 . as it will be seen in sec .",
    "[ ordersplit ] , a set of new four - fermion operators , induced by gluino exchanges , is also needed .",
    "these features single out the gluino contribution to the decay @xmath0 as one that necessarily requires a dedicated study of the implementation of qcd corrections already at the lo in qcd , before including chargino and neutralino contributions and higher - order qcd corrections . in sec .",
    "[ ordersplit ] , the list of operators induced by gluino - mediated loops is given together with the list of those needed for the sm contribution .",
    "the number of operators depends on the sources of flavour violation that are present in the particular supersymmetric model considered . in the attempt to reach the level of generality advocated above",
    ", no restriction is made on the possible sources of flavour violation in the sfermion sector .",
    "these are surveyed in sec .",
    "[ flavchange ]",
    ". also shown is the direct connection between flavour - violating sources and operators generated , emphasizing the differences between the analysis in a generic supersymmetric model and the typical msugra - inspired analyses .",
    "the wilson coefficients at the matching scale for the hamiltonian generated by gluino contributions are given in sec .  [ wilsoncoeff ] .",
    "they are calculated using the mass - eigenstate formalism , the most appropriate to deal with different off - diagonal terms in the sfermion mass matrix squared , of a priori unknown size .",
    "these coefficients evolve down to the low - scale @xmath35 independently of the usual sm coefficients , since there is no mixing between sm and gluino - induced operators .",
    "the anomalous - dimension matrix governing this evolution at the lo in qcd and the resulting analytic expressions for the low - scale wilson coefficients is given in sec .",
    "[ gmatrix ] . in sec .",
    "[ branching ] , an expression for the lo rate @xmath19 , due to the sm and the gluino - induced wilson coefficients , is derived .",
    "numerical evaluations of the branching ratio are shown in sec .",
    "[ constraints ] , when only one or at most two off - diagonal elements in the down - squark mass matrix squared are non - vanishing .",
    "as already mentioned , the decay @xmath0 can be realistically used as a tool to select viable supersymmetric flavour models only when all contributions to @xmath19 are included .",
    "the numerical evaluations of sec .  [ constraints ] , therefore , have only the purpose of illustrating the effect of the lo qcd corrections , as well as the interplay between sm and gluino contributions to the branching ratio . strictly speaking ,",
    "they give results that are valid only in particular directions of the parameter space of generic supersymmetric models , and provide , in general , some intermediate results of an ongoing , more complete analysis .",
    "in the sm , rare @xmath9-meson decays are induced by loops in which @xmath36 bosons and up - type quarks propagate .",
    "the most important corrections are due to exchanges of light particles , gluons and light quarks , which give rise to powers of the large logarithmic factor @xmath37 .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath0 obtains large logarithms @xmath38 only from loops with gluons .",
    "this implies at least one factor of @xmath1 for each large logarithm .",
    "since the two scales @xmath2 and @xmath39 are far apart , @xmath38 is a large number and these terms need to be resummed : powers of @xmath40 are resummed at the lo , terms of the form @xmath41 are obtained at the nlo .",
    "thus , the corrections to the decay amplitude are classified according to :    * ( lo ) : @xmath42 * ( nlo ) : @xmath43 ,    where @xmath44 is the fermi constant .",
    "the resummation of these corrections is usually achieved by making use of the formalism of effective hamiltonians , combined with renormalization group techniques .",
    "the needed effective hamiltonian is obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom , i.e. the top - quark and the @xmath36 boson .",

    "an illustration of this is provided by the comparison of the bounds imposed by @xmath19 on @xmath384 and @xmath385 , which are different precisely because contributions from sm - gluino interferences are possible in one case , but not in the other .",
    "the second lesson stems from the observation that different operators contributing to @xmath19 have very different numerical relevance .",
    "because of this , it is not necessarily true that the strongest constraint on a chiral - flavour - violating sfermion mass term can be derived from the operator that is generated by it in the most straightforward way .",

    "whether they are indeed much larger than chargino contributions is a model - dependent issue .",
    "the presence of the coupling @xmath1 makes these contributions also particularly interesting for fcnc processes in which qcd corrections play as important a role as the purely electroweak contributions .",

    "the calculation at the lo in qcd includes all terms of type @xmath419 , whereas the calculation at the nlo resums all terms @xmath420 .",
    "the program of implementation of qcd corrections in the sm requires that at each order in qcd , e.g. lo or nlo , the anomalous - dimension matrix of the sm operators is calculated at a higher order in @xmath1 than the matching conditions and the matrix elements .",
    "this is because in the sm , at a certain order in qcd , no other operator can mix into the magnetic operator @xmath421 without the exchange of a virtual gluon .",
    "the situation is different in the case of gluino contributions .",

    "in particular , the magnetic operator @xmath424 is now distinct from the gluino - induced one @xmath425 .",
    "this in turn has to be distinguished from the lower dimensionality operator @xmath426 , induced at the matching scale by a loop diagram in which chiral - flavour violation is provided , for example , by the insertion of a left - right mass term in the squark propagator and the insertion of a gluino mass in the gluino propagator .",
    "completely new are the four - quark operators , such as @xmath427 , with an explicit factor @xmath428 . in total , the inclusion of gluino contributions requires @xmath429 new operators and other additional @xmath429 with opposite chirality .    with the above definition of gluino - induced operators , an important goal is achieved .",

    "a numerical analysis for the inclusive branching ratio @xmath19 due to sm and gluino - induced contributions is presented .",
    "the qcd corrections to the gluino - induced contributions are found to be even more crucial than in the sm case .",
    "the non - corrected contributions to the inclusive decay @xmath10 , in fact , suffer from a severe source of uncertainty that has no counterpart in the sm . at the zeroth order in qcd",
