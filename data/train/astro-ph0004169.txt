    "theoretical models of classical novae imply that large quantities of @xmath1-unstable proton - rich nuclei are formed during a thermonuclear runaway , with half - lives of the order minutes to hours .",
    "the resulting positrons undergo annihilation in the expanding nova envelope , giving rise to a pulse of annihilation @xmath6-rays which is blueshifted and broadened by the nova velocity and lasts for up to @xmath7 hr ( 2 ) .",
    "all space - borne instruments are subject to a strong background emission line at 511 kev , arising from annihilation of cosmic ray induced @xmath1-decay positrons in the instrument , which hinders detection of the same line from cosmic sources . however , a spectrometer with sufficient energy resolution could distinguish between cosmic and background lines because the former is blueshifted , typically by 25 kev .",
    "the ge spectrometer tgrs ( fwhm resolution 3 kev at the beginning of its mission ) fulfills this requirement .",
    "its other advantages as a detector and monitor of the nova 511 kev line are its broad aperture ( nearly @xmath8 sterad ) and its high altitude high inclination orbit , in which background count rates are rather low , due to the lack of interaction with earth s trapped radiation belts , and to the virtual absence of earth albedo background radiation . the background count rate and spectrum has also been extremely stable throughout the mission .",
    "a disadvantage of ge detectors for long - term missions is progressive degradation of performance due to cosmic - ray impact damage . for this reason",
    "most of the data used here were obtained during 19951997 , before this effect became serious . in an attempt to avoid the effects of degradation , such as",
    "low - energy `` tailing '' , we fitted only energies on the high - energy ( blue ) side of the background 511 kev line .",
    "one such fitted background spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the dashed line is the strong background 511 kev line .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the fit to a theoretical nova line emitted in a 6-hr interval after the event ( 3 ) .",
    "although the amplitude of this line is significant , we will see shortly that it is characteristic of all our background spectra  in other words , there is a systematic constant positive offset in this measurement . for scale ,",
    "the dotted line shows how the same line would appear from a model nova at a distance 1 kpc",
    ". this line would be detected at a level @xmath9 .",
    "the global rate of classical novae in the galaxy is highly uncertain , since the two methods used to derive it both suffer from serious systematic problems .",
    "one involves correcting the rate of actual discoveries ( @xmath10 yr@xmath4 ) for highly uneven sky coverage and interstellar extinction for poorly - known nova distances .",
    "the other involves correcting the nova rates measured in external galaxies ( according to some parameter such as @xmath11 ) , which runs into the problem of differences in the stellar populations between galaxies .",
    "the method used here is potentially superior , being free from these biases .",
    "the 511 kev @xmath6-rays are not subject to interstellar extinction , and tgrs s sky coverage was almost uniform during the period 19951997 . between 1995",
    "january and 1997 october tgrs accumulated about @xmath12 s of background spectra ( 88% overall ) . nor are much data lost due to changing sensitivity across the aperture , which amounts to a factor @xmath1325% between the zenith and the ecliptic plane .",
    "this entire period was divided into 6 hr intervals during which background spectra were accumulated , which were fitted to models of the type shown in fig .",
    "the parameters of the nova line in these fits were fixed at values predicted by theory at epochs @xmath14 hr and @xmath15 hr after the explosion ( widths 8 kev fwhm , blueshifts 5 and 2 kev , from ref . 2 and hernanz 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "the fits to the count spectra were normalized by the effective area for the zenith angle of an average nova , which is @xmath16 .",
    "the fitted amplitudes for the 6-hr and 12-hr lines were combined in order to maximize the signal .",
    "the fitted nova line amplitudes in the 4005 resulting background spectra are shown in fig .",
    "since the positive systematic amplitude is constant to a very good approximation , we are justified in subtracting it from all measurements .",
    "we then see that there is no single 6-hr interval which , after this subtraction , yields a convincing nova signal .",
    "we chose a level @xmath5 as the threshold for detection of a candidate signal ( fig .",
    "2 , dashed line ) , which is appropriate for the expected number of chance detections in 4005 events . from poisson statistics ,",
    "our measured nova rate is therefore @xmath17 at the 63% level .",
    "the sensitivity of this survey at the @xmath5 level is about @xmath18 photon @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 4 ) .",
    "if a given nova model predicts a 511 kev line flux @xmath19 at 1 kpc then this survey could have detected it out to a distance @xmath20 kpc .",
    "unfortunately the most recent self - consistent hydrodynamic models ( 5 ) predict much smaller fluxes ( @xmath21 photon @xmath3 s@xmath4 at 1 kpc ) than earlier versions ( 2 ) , although parametrized models ( 6 ) can predict values values as high as @xmath22 photon @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "thus in the most optimistic case @xmath23 kpc , for an onemg nova of model type hh5 ( 6 ) . using the bahcall - soneira galactic mass model ( 1 ) we can extrapolate our limit @xmath17 event per @xmath12 s within 1.4 kpc ( which includes @xmath130.8% of the galaxy ) to a galactic rate @xmath24 events yr@xmath4 of this type .",
    "five novae occurred within tgrs s aperture during the period 19951997 , before the instrument performance began to deteriorate .",
    "searches for 511 kev line emission around the times of these outbursts were unsuccessful ( 3 ) , the sensitivities achieved being similar to the values given above for the overall survey . unfortunately a very bright nova v382 vel ( @xmath25 n vel 1999 ) was discovered in 1999 may , by which time the deterioration of the detector performance had advanced .",
    "three main effects contribute to this deterioration ( 7 ) : a distortion of the response to a narrow line ( starting with low - energy tailing , culminating in the formation of a separate low - energy peak ) ; a poorly - quantified loss of efficiency ; and an accelerated rate of change of the instrument gain . in order to apply our search method to nova vel we attempted approximate solutions to these problems . in the count spectrum fitting , the gaussian line models ( fig .",
    "1 ) were replaced by more complex shapes reflecting the current detector response ( evaluated from the response to the 511 kev and other background lines ) .",
    "fortunately , during the rather narrow time interval ( 1523 may ) which we fitted the response did not change significantly , nor did the gain .",
    "we estimated the detector effective area by assuming constancy of the true tgrs background line strengths , which we had found to be a very good approximation during the period of stability 19951997 ; a measurement of the 511 kev line intensity , compared with the average from 19951997 , then enabled an efficiency correction to be made .",
    "the preliminary results are shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that , compared to fig .",
    "2 , both the error bars and the systematic positive offset are much worse .",
    "the rise to visual maximum probably started at least 1 d before discovery ( arrow ) , and the explosion may have occurred up to 3 d before that .",
    "our fitted background nova line amplitude should show a single 6-hr peak at that epoch , over and above the average background level ( solid line ) .",
    "no such event was observed , so that we can only place upper limits on the line flux and a lower limit on the distance to v382 vel .",
    "the average @xmath26 upper limit above the solid line is @xmath27 photon @xmath3 s@xmath4 ; however , the constant positive offset level is much less well - defined than it was earlier in the mission ( fig .",
    "2 ) , so that a systematic error estimate for this must be introduced .",
    "we also estimated the systematic error due to the uncertainty in the nova line position arising from the broad and irregular shape of the background 511 kev line relative to which it is measured .",
    "we thus obtained an upper limit on the line flux of order @xmath28 photon @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "v382 vel is believed to have occurred on an onemg white dwarf ( 8) , in which case we can combine our flux limit with the best - case theoretical flux at 1 kpc of @xmath29 photon @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 6 ) to obtain a lower limit of 0.66 kpc on the distance .",
