    "while it is true that the standard model ( sm ) has been extensively tested very successfully by many different experiments , it is widely believed that the sm is an effective theory which needs to incorporate suitable modifications at large energies .",
    "many expect that this large energy scale could be as small as a few tev , which is right at the verge of being explored . among the list of less rigorously tested aspects of the sm tops the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the structure and values of gauge - boson self interactions",
    ". explorations of lep has largely constrained these areas , but left a lot to future investigations . the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "promises a near complete study of the higgs mechanism of the sm , and perhaps will bring out information on other mechanisms of ewsb as well . at the same time , being a hadronic machine it has limitations to undertake precision studies , for example the kind needed to understand the gauge - boson couplings . the international linear collider ( ilc ) proposed to collide high energy , high luminosity electrons and positrons",
    "has the mission of studying the standard model ( sm ) at high precision and to look for signals beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "such a machine is well suited to an in - depth analysis of the gauge sector of elementary particle interactions , within and beyond the sm .",
    "a large number of physics studies establish the fact that the potential of ilc is further enhanced by considering high energy photon - photon collisions as well as electron - photon collisions , apart from the electron - positron collisions .",
    "technical feasibility of such options are already studied in detail , and it is now expected that ilc will have these options available .    obviously , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colliders are better suited to study the photon couplings with other gauge bosons like the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this article",
    "we will focus on @xmath1 with @xmath10 .",
    "signature of such an event is a single isolated lepton with large missing energy .",
    "this process is sensitive to new physics effects including anomalous @xmath6 @xcite , composite fermion models @xcite , etc . in the case of anomalous @xmath6 couplings ,",
    "this process has the advantage over @xmath11 , which is sensitive to both @xmath6 and @xmath12 couplings .",
    "again , @xmath13 is sensitive to @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 couplings , revealing the edge of @xmath4 collider to study @xmath6 . in most of the previous studies , observables at the production level of the single @xmath14",
    "is investigated , with the exception of @xcite , where the authors consider angular spectrum of the secondary leptons , also including the effect of off - shell @xmath14 .",
    "our main aim of this work is to study the possibility to exploit the secondary lepton spectrum including the energy and angular distributions to probe relevant new physics signals .",
    "to illustrate the idea , we consider the case of anomalous @xmath6 coupling .    in many models beyond the sm the quartic- and triple - gauge boson couplings including @xmath6are altered from their sm values . in a model independent approach , an effective lagrangian with terms additional to the sm lagrangian",
    "is considered in phenomenological and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "relevant to the process considered here , the effective @xmath6 vertex is commonly parametrized in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath15 , in the absence of cp violation ( with vanishing sm values ) .",
    "lep constraints in single - parameter analysis ( taking one parameter at a time , keeping the others at their sm values ) gives bounds of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and two - parameter analysis limits their values to @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite at 95% c.l .",
    "tevatron constraints from @xmath20 process are not contaminated by other couplings , but are more relaxed compared the lep constraints to give @xmath21 and @xmath22 at 95% c.l .",
    "phenomenology of anomalous @xmath6 coupling in the context of lhc as well as ilc has been carried out in a number of recent publications @xcite . in particular , @xcite has analyzed single @xmath14 production with its leptonic decay to probe the effect of anomalous couplings in @xmath4 collision . in this work",
    "we exploit the full potential of the secondary lepton spectrum to study the effect of @xmath6 coupling in @xmath23 with @xmath2 deviating from its sm value .",
    "we leave out the dimension six operator corresponding to @xmath15 from this analysis .    in the next section",
    "we provide some details of the process and the observables used . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results , and finally summarize the study and present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "considering a real on - shell photon , the most general cp - conserving @xmath6 coupling within a lorentz invariant lagrangian can be written in the following form @xcite .",
    "@xmath24    in the sm , the gauge structure @xmath25 dictates the @xmath6 couplings , with vanishing @xmath2 and @xmath15 at tree level . therefore , precise measurements of these couplings will test the gauge sector of the electroweak interactions .",

    "the main aim of this work is to explore possibilities to exploit energy and angle distributions of the secondary muon to probe the physics beyond the sm .",
    "we aim to exemplify this with a study of the anomalous @xmath6 coupling . in what follows",

    "part of the reason is to add clarity to the main focus of the study presented .",
    "a more complete study of effect of anomalous couplings in @xmath4 collision will be carried out in a future work .",
    "we perform our computation in the narrow - width approximation ( nwa ) in which the @xmath14-propagator is approximated to get @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass and @xmath34 is the width of the @xmath14 boson .    to perform phase space integrations we fix our reference frame as the centre of mass frame ( cmf ) of the colliding electron and photon system .",

    "notice that the muon energy in the cmf is bounded by @xmath50 .    to obtain the distribution in the lab frame , we need to boost the above differential cross section appropriately . for an electron beam energy of @xmath51 and photon energy of @xmath52 , we have the following relation between the variables in the cmf and the laboratory frame .",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 is the speed of the cmf compared to the lab frame , and @xmath55 .",

    "integrations over the photon distribution variable @xmath65 , the scaled muon energy @xmath66 and the muon angular variable @xmath57 in appropriate cases are performed numerically using the cuhre routines under the cuba package @xcite . from now on we will drop the superscript @xmath67 from the variables , and interchangeably use @xmath68 or @xmath44 to denote the secondary lepton ( muon ) energy in the lab frame .",

    "experimentally it is more useful to understand the effect on the final state particles arising from @xmath14 decay .",

    "@xcite takes into account the contribution due to off - shell @xmath14 along with the on - shell production , our work is in the nwa assuming on - shell @xmath14 production . at the same time",
    ", the semi - analytical method presented gives a handle on the application of useful experimental cuts , as we demonstrate in the next section .",
    "for our numerical analysis we consider an ilc , with the option of @xmath4 collision using backscattered laser photons , expected to run from @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) centre of mass energy of 300 gev through 1 tev , with possible extension to higher energies . when we discuss observables at specific centre of mass energy values , we will take two example values of centre of mass energy of @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 tev .    for the anomalous couplings , we consider the boundary points from the lep results , @xmath73    for completeness , we first consider the total cross section . fig .",

    "figure on the left corresponds sm showing the effect of muon energy ( @xmath68 ) and muon angle ( @xmath76 ) cuts .",
    "as is seen , angular cut is somewhat sensitive , but the cut on @xmath68 has no significant effect . reasons for this will be clear when we discuss the distributions below . in figure on the right ,",
    "the total cross section in the presence of anomalous coupling is compared with that of the sm case .",
    "the sensitivity is slightly less than 10% for most of the @xmath74 beyond @xmath77 gev .",
    "we next consider the angular distribution of the secondary muons , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigct ] .",
    "figure on the left shows the effect of cut on @xmath68 on the sm distributions at centre of mass energies of 500 gev and 1 tev .",
    "as can be seen , the effect is more pronounced at larger @xmath78 values , while most of the events are gathered in the backward direction . with high luminosity ,",
    "one expect high statistics for single @xmath14 production at @xmath4 collider . in such case the tail region",
    "could also perhaps be probed . in the right side figure angular distribution at @xmath79 gev is analyzed for effects of anomalous couplings .",
    "the shape remains the same in all cases , when we add anomalous couplings to the sm case .",
    "the effect is not very significant , and neither does the @xmath68 cut seem to help .    to understand the energy spectrum of the muons produced , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigx ] we plot the distribution against @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the electron beam energy .",
    "notice that the distribution is qualitatively different for different @xmath74 .",
    "also the effect of cut on @xmath76 is larger for higher @xmath74 .",
    "this show that for higher center of mass energies , the events are more clustered along the beam .",
    "figure on the right side shows the effect of anomalous couplings in the distribution . here , the sensitivity is marginally improved at higher @xmath68 values compared to lower values .",
    "when no angular cut is applied , more than 10% deviation is observed for both the values of @xmath2 used .",
    "the effect is slightly better at larger centre of mass energy values .",
    "angular cut brings down both statistics as well as sensitivity .",
    "perhaps an asymmetric angular cut is better in this case .    moving on to the energy and angle double - distribution of secondary muons , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigxct ] we plot the two - dimensional projections of this distribution at @xmath79 gev , where fixing the angle the distribution is studied by varying @xmath68 .",
    "figure on the left shows case of sm .",
    "clearly the energy distribution depends on what angle we are observing this .",
    "the peak of the distribution moves from lower values of @xmath68 to higher values as we go from smaller @xmath76 values to larger ones . here",
    "we have a tool to probe new physics effects , which deviate from this behaviour .",
    "the case of anomalous coupling ( @xmath2 ) considered in this work behaves similar to that of the sm .",
    "therefore for model discrimination we need to rely on quantitative analyses . at the same time , judicious choice of regions of @xmath82 plane can be made to improve sensitivity to new physics in this case .",
    "this is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : xct3d ] and [ fig : xct3danom ] , where we can see that difference between cases with anomalous coupling and sm are larger in regions where @xmath68 is larger . we may also mention that , it is possible that many new physics effects present even qualitatively different distributions . the energy - angle distribution will be more useful in such cases .",
    "a more complete analysis in this directions will be presented in a future work .",
    "while , when considering the single @xmath14 production in @xmath4 collisions , angular distribution of secondary muons in the lab frame is easily constructed , and is readily available in the literature , such is not the case of its energy distribution . here",
    "he have presented a semi - analytical way to explore the secondary lepton energy - angle distributions in @xmath1 with @xmath83 .",
    "the advantage of such an observable in analyzing the sm case and probing possible new physics effects is demonstrated .",
    "variables being defined in the lab frame , can be directly used to apply experimental cuts .",
    "many other observables like forward - backward asymmetry , etc . can be easily constructed from the distribution studied . as an example of new physics effect we considered the presence of cp - conserving dimension four anomalous @xmath6 coupling .",
    "we studied the application of angular and energy cuts on the distributions , as well as studied the energy - angle distribution of the secondary muons , and conclude that judicious usage of observables discussed can probe the presence of new physics in single @xmath14 production in @xmath4 collisions more effectively .",
    "results presented are obtained with unpolarized beams . since @xmath14 couples only to the left - handed electrons , fully left - polarized electron beams along with unpolarized photon beams will only enhance ( double ) the statistics .",
    "at the same time , effect of photon beam polarization is unavoidable in @xmath4 collisions , and the compton backscattered photons are not unpolarized .",
    "also , we considered an ideal compton backscattered spectrum @xcite for our studies . to be more accurate , one need to consider a realistic photon spectrum including the non - linear effects , and the polarization of the photon beam . * acknowledgement * : + pp s work is partly supported by a brns , dae project .    *",
    "appendix : photon luminosity distribution * + the colliding photons in a realistic electron - photon collider does not have a fixed energy , rather the beam will have distribution of photons with energy varying over an allowed range ( which depends on the initial electron and laser photon energies among other things ) . in such colliders ,",
    "the cross section and other observables should , therefore , be properly folded with a luminosity distribution function to get the measurable quantities , as is done in eq .",
    "[ eqn : lumfold ] .    at ilc high energy , high luminosity photon beam is obtained by compton backscattering of low energy , high intensity laser beam off high energy electron beam .",

    "@xmath65 thus gives the fraction of the electron energy carried by the scattered photon .",
