    "as trapped cold atoms appear to be very sensitive to magnetic - field variations , they represent a powerful tool in magnetic field imaging as well as in gaining insight into atom - surface coupling phenomena @xcite .",
    "the challenge is to keep the atoms as close as possible to the substrate material to map the magnetic and electric fields in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "the combination of quantum state control with the development of ever - smaller magnetic traps is an essential element in the implementation of integrated quantum devices for fundamental research , quantum information processing and precision measurement .    along with",
    "the push towards miniaturization evolved the idea of devising even smaller structures based on carbon nanotubes ( cns ) @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes are carbon mono - layers rolled - up into cylinders of a few nanometers diameter @xcite .",
    "they have been widely investigated theoretically and experimentally as they play a key role in miniaturized electronic , mechanical , electromechanical and scanning - probe devices . for their potential use as miniaturized current - carrying wires",
    "it is important to realize that the desired close proximity of a neutral atom and the carbon atoms that make up the nanotube can vastly enhance the influence of dispersion forces , and we address this point in the paper .",
    "it is well known that an atom held in a magnetic trap near an absorbing dielectric surface will be subject to thermally - induced spin flip transitions whose origin lies in fluctuating magnetic fields which can be attributed to resistive noise in the substrate @xcite . in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,",
    "dissipation processes associated with a finite conductivity give rise to electromagnetic - field fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations can be strong enough to drive spin transitions that lead to trapping losses @xcite .",
    "in addition , an atom placed near a dielectric body will experience a dispersion force due to the presence of the dielectric material  the casimir  polder force @xcite .",
    "the potential generating this force adds to the magnetic trapping potential and may cause the trap to become unstable at small distances .    with this in mind",
    ", cns seem to represent rather attractive structures for designing miniaturized magnetic traps .",
    "this is on one hand due to the fact that they consist of a very small amount of dielectric matter which means that unwanted dispersion forces such as the casimir  polder force are minimized . on the other hand , they also possess extremely homogeneous surfaces and are thus less likely to induce inhomogeneities in the potential surface of the trap .",

    "[ sec : potential ] we introduce the basic concepts of magnetic trapping of neutral atoms . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lifetime ] the spin flip lifetime is calculated and compared to the tunneling lifetime resulting from the combination of the magnetic trapping potential and the casimir  polder potential .",

    "let us consider a current @xmath11 flowing through a wire along the @xmath12 direction that generates a circular magnetic field @xmath13 .    applying a homogeneous bias magnetic field @xmath14 pointing in a direction orthogonal to the wire , a line of vanishing magnetic field parallel to the wire",

    "the physical properties of a cn are determined by the way in which the graphite sheet is rolled . the winding angle with respect to the hexagonal carbon lattice",

    "khz , chosen as to correspond to an offset field @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44 . hence , a @xmath40 carbon nanotube can indeed be considered as a metallic cylinder .",
    "thermal fluctuations generate noise currents that lead to fluctuating fields near the body surface .",
    "we expect the noise due to these fluctuating fields to be much reduced in a cn compared to a dielectric bulk material due to the very small amount of matter involved .",
    "nevertheless , thermal spin flips and the casimir  polder force can not be neglected and needs investigation and a comparison of their effect .",
    "both mechanisms originate from the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the substrate . in particular , the spin - flip transitions are caused by the magnetic - field fluctuations while the casimir - polder force arises from both electric and magnetic field fluctuations , the latter usually being negligible .    in order to describe the two phenomena we utilize the quantization scheme of the electromagnetic field in the presence of dispersing and absorbing bodies @xcite .",
    "as this theory is a macroscopic theory whose central quantities are linear susceptibilities , carbon nanotubes are probably at the limit to what we can actually describe with it .",
    "however , when viewed from distances that are several multiples of the bond lengths , the cn can be thought of as a homogeneous object so that the detailed structure from the surface can not be resolved and qed in dielectrics can be safely used .",
    "this also assumes that the cn contains no impurities and shows no pitch alterations .",

    "in particular , the electric surface current density creates a discontinuity in the tangential component of the magnetic field @xcite . to compute the full green tensor ,",

    "the spin flip lifetime can reach one minute for distances approaching @xmath76  nm and exceeds more than @xmath1  s for trapping distances larger than @xmath77  nm . these results suggest that an atom can be held very close to a metallic cn for sufficiently long times , and this is in line with our expectations about spin flip occurrence and with the atom - loss rate estimations presented in @xcite .",
    "the presence of macroscopic dielectric bodies changes drastically the structure of the vacuum electromagnetic field .",
    "one consequence is that an atom in its ground state placed sufficiently close to a dielectric body experiences a non - vanishing , in general attractive , dispersion force , the casimir  polder ( cp ) force @xcite .",
    "since the cp potential adds to the ( repulsive ) trapping potential , atoms can tunnel through the resulting potential barrier and get stuck at the nanotube surface .",

    "the resonant contributions corresponding to virtual dipole absorption @xcite are suppressed because @xmath97  j  @xmath98 . on the other hand ,",
    "the spacing between the matsubara frequencies is one order of magnitude smaller than the lowest electronic transition frequency ( the relevant frequency range over which the cp potential has to be computed ) so that the matsubara sum can be replaced by the integral in eq .",

    "in this paper we have investigated a novel way of miniaturizing atomic magnetic traps by replacing solid current - carrying wires by carbon nanotubes as the elementary building blocks . at first sight ,",
    "the advantages of using cns are both their small diameter and the fact that they are effectively two - dimensional structures .",
    "hence , one would expect from scaling arguments that traps at rather small atom - surface distances could be realized .",
    "we have investigated the loss mechanisms both due to thermally induced spin flips as well as by tunneling through the casimir  polder barrier .",
    "the calculations have been performed within the framework of quantum electrodynamics in dielectric media which is valid as long as the dielectric properties of the nanotube can be described by a macroscopic permittivity , and if the experimental situation is such that the atomic structure of the cn can not be resolved and macroscopic boundary conditions can be set .",
    "the spin flip lifetime has been found to scale according to our expectations .",
    "that is , this lifetime follows , as a function of the atom - surface distance , the same power law as in the case of a solid wire , with the result that for distances much larger than the radius of the nanotube the expected lifetime exceeds several seconds . in contrast , the alterations of the trapping potential by the casimir  polder potential are much more severe .",
    "it appears that the minimal feasible trapping distance is larger than @xmath1  nm .",
    "the main reason explaining this result is that single - wall nanotubes can not sustain high enough currents ( and thus can not generate deep enough magnetic traps ) as they saturate at high electric fields . as a potential remedy , it would be beneficial considering multi - wall nanotubes . an increased number of carbon layers would allow for higher current densities and consequently to a magnetic trapping potential that would be comparable with the casimir  polder potential even for smaller distances .    we like to thank lene v. hau who , after an initial discussion , stimulated our interest in this subject .",
