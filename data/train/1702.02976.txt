    "in this paper we continue our investigation of boundary - value problems in thin multi - structures with a local geometric irregularity , which we have begun in @xcite .",
    "namely , we modify and generalize our approach for more complicated structures that consist of thin curvilinear cylinders connected through a domain of small diameter .    investigations of various physical and biological processes in channels , junctions and networks are urgent for numerous fields of natural sciences ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "a particular interest is the investigation of the influence of a local geometric heterogeneity in vessels on the blood flow .",
    "this is both an aneurysm ( a pathological extension of an artery like a bulge ) and a stenosis ( a pathological restriction of an artery ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors classified 12 different aneurysms and proposed a numerical approach for this study .",
    "the aneurysm models have been meshed with 800,000  1,200,000 tetrahedral cells containing three boundary layers .",
    "it was showed that the geometric aneurysm form essentially impacts on the haemodynamics of the blood flow . however , as was noted by the authors , _ the question how to model blood flow with sufficient accuracy is still open_.    this question was the main motivation for us to begin the study of boundary - value problems in domains of such type and to detect the influence of their local geometric irregularity on properties of solutions .",
    "it is clear that such domains are prototypes of many other biological and engineering structures , but we prefer to call them _ aneurysm - type domains _ as comprehensive and concise .    in this paper",
    "we use the asymptotic approach for boundary - value problems in thin domains .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "let us consider a boundary - value problem in a neighborhood of an aneurysm .",
    "after the nondimensionalization , we get a parameter @xmath4 characterizing thickness of the domain . in many cases , e.g. for brain aneurysms ,",
    "@xmath4 is a small parameter .",
    "thus , it is natural to study the behaviour of this problem as @xmath4 tends to zero . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , the thin aneurysm - type domain is transformed into a graph and the aneurysm is transformed into the origin if @xmath2        so , the aim is to find the corresponding limit problem and detect the impact of the aneurysm .",
    "obviously , this limit problem in the graph will be simpler , since it is one - dimensional problem .",
    "then we can either analytically solve the limit problem or apply numerical methods .",
    "there are several approaches to construct asymptotic approximations for solutions to boundary - value problems in thin rod structures .",
    "the method of the partial asymptotic domain decomposition ( mpadd ) , proposed in @xcite , was applied in the book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) to the following problem in a finite thin rod structure @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the union of sections of the rod structure @xmath9 @xmath10 is the connected component of @xmath11 containing the node @xmath12 the main idea of this method is to reduce the problem to a simplified form on @xmath13 where the regular asymptotics of the solution is located . the initial formulation is kept on a small neighbourhood of the domain @xmath14 where the asymptotic behavior is singular . then these two models are coupled by some special interface conditions that are derived from some projection procedure . for this , the author proposed a method of redistribution of constants to have the boundary - layer solutions exponentially decaying at infinity . as a result , for the leading term of the asymptotic expansion",
    "the following estimate was obtained : @xmath15 then this method has been applied to constructions of asymptotic expansions both for the solution of the wave equation on a thin rod structure @xcite , for the solution of non - steady navier - stokes equations with uniform boundary conditions in a thin tube structure @xmath16 @xcite , for the uniform dirichlet boundary value problem for the biharmonic equation in a thin t - like shaped plane domain @xcite and for other problems @xcite .",
    "thus , the method ( mpadd ) is used in the case of the uniform boundary conditions on the lateral rectilinear surfaces of thin rods ( cylinders ) and if the right - hand sides depend only on the longitudinal variable in the direction of the corresponding rod and they are constant in some neighbourhoods of the nodes and vertices .",
    "we see that the main difficulty in such problems is the identification of the behaviour of solutions in neighbourhoods of the nodes ( aneurysms ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors made the following assumptions :    * the first terms of the volume force @xmath17 and surface load @xmath18 on the rods satisfy special orthogonality conditions ( see @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xcite ) and the second term of the volume force @xmath17 has an identified form and depends only on the longitudinal variable , * similar orthogonality conditions for the right - hand sides on the knots are satisfied ( see @xmath21 ) and the second term is a piecewise constant vector - function ( see @xmath22 ) ,    to overcome this difficulty and to construct the leading terms of the elastic - field asymptotics for solutions of the equations of anisotropic elasticity on junctions of thin beams ( @xmath23 and @xmath0 cases ) . due to these assumptions the displacement field at each knot can be approximated by a rigid displacement . as a result , the approximation does not contain boundary - layer terms , i.e. _ the asymptotic expansion is not complete a priori _ ( * ? ? ? * remark 3.1 ) .    using the method of two - scale expansions , the complete asymptotic expansion in powers @xmath4 and @xmath24 for a solution of a linear partial deferential equation in the simplest @xmath25-dimensional rectangular periodic carcass",
    "was constructed in @xcite ( here @xmath4 is the period of the carcass and @xmath26 is the area of the cross - section of beams ) .",
    "a new feature of the present paper in comparison with the papers mentioned above is construction and justification of the complete asymptotic expansion for the solution to a nonuniform neumann boundary - value problem for the poisson equation in a thin @xmath0 aneurysm - type domain and the proof both energetic and pointwise uniform estimates for the difference between the solution of the starting problem @xmath27 and the solution of the corresponding limit problem @xmath3 without any orthogonality conditions for the right - hand side in the equation and for the right - hand sides in the neumann boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , the right - hand sides can depend both on longitudinal and transversal variables and the thin cylinders can be curvilinear .    to construct the asymptotic expansion in the whole domain , we use the method of matching asymptotic expansions ( see @xcite ) with special cut - off functions .",
    "the asymptotic expansion consists of three parts , namely , the regular part of the asymptotics located inside of each thin cylinder , the boundary - layer part near the base of each thin cylinder , and the inner part of the asymptotics discovered in a neighborhood of the aneurysm .",
    "the terms of the inner part of the asymptotics are special solutions of boundary - value problems in an unbounded domain with different outlets at infinity .",
    "it turns out they have polynomial growth at infinity . matching these parts",
    ", we derive the limit problem @xmath3 in the corresponding graph and the recurrence procedure to determine all terms of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we proved energetic estimates that allow us to identify more precisely the impact of the aneurysm on some properties of the whole structure .",
    "one of the main results obtained in this paper is the energetic estimate ( see corollary  [ corollary1 ] ) @xmath28 in the sobolev space @xmath29 instead of @xmath30-space in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ( see ( [ p ] ) ) . here",
    "@xmath31 is a fixed number from the interval @xmath32 in addition , pointwise uniform estimates are deduced in the case of rectilinear cylinders .",
    "it should be stressed that the error estimates and convergence rate are very important both for justification of adequacy of one- or two - dimensional models that aim at description of actual three - dimensional thin bodies and for the study of boundary effects and effects of local ( internal ) inhomogeneities in applied problems .",
    "pointwise estimates are of particular importance for engineering practice , since large values of tearing stresses in a small region at first cause local material damage and then lead to destruction of the whole construction .",
    "thus , our approach makes it possible to take into account various factors ( e.g. variable thickness of thin curvilinear cylinders , inhomogeneous boundary conditions , geometric characteristics of aneurysms , etc . ) in statements of boundary - value problems on graphs .",
    "in addition , the transition from two - dimensional to three - dimensional problems , the variable thickness of thin cylinders and their arbitrary number , special behaviour of the inner terms , and the matching procedure are the major differences and difficulties that were overcome in contrast to our previous paper @xcite .    also this approach has been applied to nonlinear monotone boundary - value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions in thin aneurysm - type domains to construct the leading terms of the asymptotics and these results were announced at the conference @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that in @xcite we studied a boundary - value problem in the union of thin rectangles without any local geometric irregularity . in this case",
    "the inner part of the asymptotics is absent and we have to equate simply the regular parts to obtain transmission conditions in the respective limit problem .      in section [ statement ] , we describe the domain @xmath33 and the statement of the problem .",
    "the formal asymptotic expansion for the solution to the problem ( [ probl ] ) is constructed in section  [ formal asymptotics ] . in section  [ justification ] , we justify the asymptotics ( theorem  [ maintheorem ] ) and prove asymptotic estimates for the leading terms of the asymptotics ( corollaries  [ corollary1 ] , [ corollary2 ] and [ corollary3 ] ) . in the conclusions ,",
    "we analyze results obtained in this paper and discuss possible generalizations .",
    "the model thin aneurysm - type domain @xmath33 consists of three thin curvilinear cylinders @xmath34 that are joined through a domain @xmath35 ( referred in the sequel `` aneurysm '' ) . here",

    ".    we can consider more general thin aneurysm - type domains with arbitrary orientation of thin cylinders ( their number can be also arbitrary ) . but to avoid technical and huge calculations and to demonstrate the main steps of the proposed asymptotic approach we consider a such kind of the thin aneurysm - type domain , when the cylinders are placed on the coordinate axes .     , width=283 ]    in @xmath50 we consider the following mixed boundary - value problem : @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 is the outward normal derivative , + the given functions @xmath17 and @xmath54 are smooth and @xmath55 where @xmath56 it follows from the theory of linear boundary - value problems that , for any fixed value of @xmath57 the problem  ( [ probl ] ) possesses a unique weak solution @xmath58 from the sobolev space @xmath59 such that its traces on the ends @xmath60 of the domain @xmath33 are equal to zero and the solution satisfies the integral identity @xmath61 for any function @xmath62 such that @xmath63    the aim of the present paper is to    * develop a procedure to construct the complete asymptotic expansion for the solution to the problem ( [ probl ] ) as the small parameter @xmath64 * justify this procedure and prove the corresponding asymptotic estimates ; * derive the corresponding limit problem @xmath3 ; * prove energetic and uniform pointwise estimates for the difference between the solution of the problem   ( [ probl ] ) and the solution of the limit problem , from which the influence of the aneurysm will be observed .",
    "we propose the following asymptotic ansatzes for the solution to the problem  ( [ probl ] ) :    1 .",
    "the regular part of the asymptotics @xmath65 is located inside of each thin cylinder @xmath66 ( see fig .  [ fig-4 ] ) and their terms depend both on the corresponding longitudinal variable @xmath67 and so - called `` quick variables '' @xmath68 2 .",

    "an important problem of existing multi - scale methods is their stability and accuracy .",
    "the proof of the error estimate between the constructed approximation and the exact solution is a general principle that has been applied to the analysis of the efficiency of a multi - scale method . in our paper , we have constructed and justified the asymptotic expansion for the solution to problem ( [ probl ] ) and proved the corresponding estimates .",
    "it should be noted here that we do not assume any orthogonality conditions for the right - hand sides in the equation and in the neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the results showed the possibility to replace the complex boundary - value problem ( [ probl ] ) with the corresponding @xmath400- dimensional boundary - value problem ( [ main ] ) in the graph @xmath401 with sufficient accuracy measured by the parameter @xmath4 characterizing the thickness and the local geometrical irregularity . in this regard",

    "it is the natural approach for approximations of solutions to boundary - value problems in perturbed domains . in comparison to the method of the partial asymptotic domain decomposition @xcite ,",
    "this method gives better estimate even for the first terms @xmath212 in the @xmath30-norm ( compare ( [ p ] ) and the second estimate in ( [ t5 ] ) ) without any additional assumptions for the right - hand sides .",
    "the energetic estimate ( [ t5 ] ) partly confirms the first formal result of @xcite ( see p.  296 ) that the local geometric irregularity of the analyzed structure does not significantly affect on the global - level properties of the framework , which are described by the limit problem ( [ main ] ) and its solution @xmath402 ( the first terms of the asymptotics )",
    ".    therefore , convergence results , which were obtained for second - order problems in a thin t - like shaped domain ( see @xcite and references therein ) can not show the influence of the aneurysm . but thanks to estimates ( [ t6 ] ) and ( [ t8 + ] )  ( [ t10 + ] ) it became possible now to identify the impact of the geometric irregularity and material characteristics of the aneurysm on the global level through the second terms @xmath403 of the regular asymptotics ( [ regul ] ) .",
    "they depend on the constants @xmath404 @xmath405 and @xmath406 that take into account all those factors ( see ( [ delta_1 ] ) and ( [ d_1^ * ] ) )",
    ". this conclusion does not coincide with the second main result of @xcite ( see p. 296 ) that `` _ the joints of normal type manifest themselves on the local level only _ '' .",
    "in addition , in @xcite the authors stated that the main idea of their approach `` _ is to use a local perturbation corrector of the form @xmath407 with the condition that the function @xmath408 is localized near the joint _ '' , i.e. , @xmath409 as @xmath410 and the main assumption of this approach is that @xmath411    as shown the coefficients @xmath147 of the inner asymptotics ( [ junc ] ) behave as polynomials at infinity and do not decrease exponentially ( see ( [ inner_asympt ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , they influence directly the terms of the regular asymptotics beginning with the second terms .",
    "thus , the main assumption made in @xcite is not correct .",
    "* 4 . * from the first estimate in ( [ t5 ] ) it follows that the gradient @xmath412 is equivalent to @xmath413 in the @xmath30-norm over whole junction @xmath33 as @xmath2 obviously , this estimate is not informative in the neighbourhood @xmath414 of the aneurysm @xmath415    thanks to estimates ( [ t6 ] ) and ( [ t - joint0 ] ) , we get the approximation of the gradient ( flux ) of the solution both in the curvilinear cylinders  @xmath416 @xmath417 : @xmath418 and in the neighbourhood @xmath414 of the aneurysm : @xmath419 also using estimates ( [ t0 ] ) , we can obtain better approximations for the solution and its gradient with preset accuracy @xmath420 @xmath421    * 5 . *",
    "we regard that the estimates ( [ t9 ] ) and ( [ t10 ] ) can be proved without the assumptions that @xmath422 for this we should apply the following second energy inequality in  @xmath333 @xmath423 but the question how the constant @xmath424 depends on the parameter @xmath4 remains open .",
