    "jets are an interesting issue in astrophysics . we know how they are produced and propagate through space , but there are still some questions regarding their interaction with their environment . in theory ,",
    "galactic jets seem to be streams of plasma directed perpendicular to an accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole .",
    "observations reveal curved jets .",
    "such jet bending is due to the interaction of the jet with a nebula , a gas cloud , a density anisotropy , or any other cause that can be expressed as a pressure gradient while the jet is journeying through the galactic center or the intergalactic medium .",
    "the bending of a jet depends on its velocity and on the external pressure gradient ( @xcite , secs .",
    "i and iii ) . assuming that ( i ) the pressure gradient is distance - dependent ( @xcite , fig .",
    "5.4 ) , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are model parameters , and that ( ii ) this behaviour is the same for any jet , then the difference in jet bending is due to the velocity profile .",
    "even though small scale jets are usually considered to be accelerating to speeds near the speed of light , velocities for parsec and kilo - parsec scales are of order @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , table  1 ) ; and they are generally considered constant . for galactic jets owing to agn , which can reach lengths of up to a few mega - parsecs",
    ", it is probably of lower significance to consider time - varying velocities .",
    "still , given the scales involved , we can not assume that they are constant , especially when their interaction with the pressure gradient is taken into account .",
    "accordingly , we have to examine two scenarios : either an accelerating jet , until it becomes relativistic or destroyed after interacting with an external pressure , or a decelerating one .",
    "for our jet model , we adopt a two - dimensional kinematical model ( @xcite , eq .  5.17 ; we use here the definitions and symbols of this investigation ) , @xmath4^{-3/2 } = \\ , \\frac{1}{\\rho u^2 } \\ , \\ , \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}|_{\\perp},\\ ] ] where ( @xcite , eq .  5.18 )",

    "to compile our code , we use the gfortran compiler , licensed under the gnu general public license ( gpl ; http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html ) .",

    "the full slatec release is available in http://netlib.org / slatec/. in particular , to compute integrals we use the subroutine ` dgaus8 ` , which integrates real functions in one variable along finite intervals on the basis of an adaptive 8-point legendre - gauss algorithm , and which is appropriate for high accuracy integrations .",
    "after some preliminary tests of the code , we examine four different cases for the velocity profile .",
    "two cases have to do with an accelerating jet ( linear and nonlinear ) , and further two with a decelerating one ( linear and nonlinear ) . for the nonlinear case",

    ", we proceed in examining the cases for parsec and kilo - parsec scale jets .      in the case of parsec scale jets , we assume that the bending is caused by an external pressure gradient interacting with the jet while moving through the galactic center .",
    "we examine sixteen different sets of parameters . in detail",
    ", we introduce four `` velocity coefficients '' , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , in order for the velocity to vary from one to two orders of magnitude ( @xcite , sec .",
    "4 ) @xmath18 in addition , for each velocity coefficient @xmath19 , we use four values of the parameter @xmath10 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , corresponding to angles @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "numerical experiments with several angles show that these particular values lead to distinguishable graphs ( since close angles yield almost identical curves ) .",

    "all @xmath30 and @xmath31 values are given in pc .",
    "we can see how the velocity affects the shape of the jet , and how the interaction angle affects the final length of the jet .",
    "moreover , in all cases computed , all values @xmath30 corresponding to @xmath32  pc are of order(s ) below the accuracy of the computations , so considered to be zero .",
    "all @xmath30 values corresponding to @xmath33  pc are of order(s ) @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "these values correspond to a diversion of approximately @xmath36@xmath37  km ; even thought it is very small compared to the scale of the jets , it can not be neglected .",
    "we can conclude that the bending of the jet begins at a distance between 100  pc and 200  pc from the source .    knowing the speed of the jet , and reducing observational data to scale",
    ", we can draw information and conclusion about the velocity variation and interaction angle .",
    "we consider the well - known jets of the structures 4c53.37 and 1159 + 583 in the galaxy clusters abell 2220 and abell 1446 , respectively .",
    "the bending of the jets is now due to the relative movement of the galaxy through the `` intercluster medium '' ( icm ) .",
    "since , in this case , we have a much larger scale ( hundreds of kilo - parsecs ) , we adopt a nonrelativistic hydrodynamic expression for the velocity given by the euler equation @xmath38 following a similar analysis as before , the expression for the velocity becomes ( @xcite , eq .",

    "@xmath46 is equal to the radius of the galactic center ; for the case of icm with low density , on the other hand , @xmath46 coincides with the length of the jet .    using parameters given in @xcite ( secs .",

    "[ f6 ] and [ f7 ] show how the shape of the jet does change with different intercluster densities .",
    "for the case of 4c53.37 there is a formidable variation in the shape of the curves between density ratios , whereas for the case of 1159 + 583 the differences are small . comparing our results with observational data given by @xcite and @xcite for 4c53.37 and 1159 + 583 , respectively , and taking into account only the main jet , even though the jet in 4c53.37 seems to have lost its shape , if we imagine the path it would have followed , both jets seem to be in agreement with our computations .",
    "approximating a two dimensional kinematical model by some simplified simulations , we have studied the velocity profiles of large scale jets by assuming that their speed is not constant .",
    "we have seen that , when the velocity of the jet decreases linearly , the angle of interaction affects the length of the jet ; and the bending begins at distances over 100  pc from the source . regarding kilo - parsec scale jets",
