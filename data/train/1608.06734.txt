    "the origin and evolution of neutron - capture elements in our galaxy still remain poorly understood . detailed chemical composition of stars with atmospheres enriched with heavy elements can provide clues for better understanding .",
    "barium stars along with ch stars and the more metal - poor analogs of ch stars , the carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp)-s stars provide important targets .",
    "barium stars , first identified as a distinct group of peculiar objects by bidelman & keenan ( 1951 ) are pop i red gaints with spectral class g to k. their spectra show strong presence of singly ionized ba ii lines , indicating an overabundance of s - process elements .",
    "variations in radial - velocity in barium stars was revealed by mcclure et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and further confirmed by mcclure ( 1983 , 1984 ) and udry et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) .",
    "the binary nature of barium stars was established from the observed radial velocity variations that suggested presence of companions .",
    "the most accepted interpretation for the observed abundance patterns in barium stars is that , they acquired the enrichment of s - process nucleosynthesis from an agb companion that later evolved to a white dwarf .",
    "detailed abundance studies of barium stars are thus important for a better understanding of the s - process mechanisms in agb stars , as well as the mass transfer mechanisms in binary systems .",
    "present theories include two main types of mass transfer mechanisms for barium stars in binary systems , the roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) and wind - accretion scenarios . in the rlof scenario , for sufficiently close binaries containing a thermally pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) star , as the star expands past the roche lobe the material which lies outside the lobe can fall off into the secondary object . in the wind accretion model of boffin & jorrisen ( 1988 )",
    ", the authors have shown that for large orbital separation the contamination of ba stars depends only upon the present value of orbital separation and mass of the white dwarf companion . here",
    "part of matter are ejected through a wind by an agb star and the system remain always detached .",
    "this is the more favoured channel for barium star formation .",
    "an intermediate regime in which some wind mass - transfer occurs before rlof begins has also been suggested ( han et al .",
    "@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , none of these models can explain all the physical and orbital properties of ba stars .",
    "while rlof scenario is not favourable as this terminates the tp - agb and lessens the production of barium , preventing barium - star formation , the wind - accretion scenario does not explain the distribution of eccentricities and periods of barium stars ( izzard et al .",
    "@xmath7 ) .",
    "further studies are necessary to have clearer pictures on these issues .",
    "as much insight about the origin and evolution of heavy elements and the evolved agb companion can be obtained from the chemical composition studies of these objects , and , given the current number of abundance analyses available , ( although gradually increasing but for limited number of heavy elements ) , detailed abundance studies of even one or two more objects represent a significant contribution .",
    "in the present work we have undertaken to conduct a detailed chemical composition study for four peculiar stars listed in the barium stars catalogue of l ( 1991 ) , based on high resolution spectra ( r @xmath8 42000 ) and high s / n with @xmath9 100 at about 5500  . among these four stars two objects hd  49641 and hd  58368 are included in the list of ` certain ba ii stars ' and one object hd  119650 is included in the list of ` marginal ba ii stars ' of macconnell et al .",
    "no detailed studies were available in literature for these objects until recently when these two objects , hd  49641 and hd  58368 are found to be included in the chemical composition studies of barium stars by yang et al .",

    "we have presented abundances for eleven neutron - capture elements and compared and contrast our results for these two objects with the results of the above two studies whenever possible .",
    "the other two objects , hitherto not studied , are found to be mild barium stars with [ ba / fe ] @xmath5 0.4 .    in section @xmath10",

    "( 1999 , 2001 ) for giant stars are lower than our estimates by 350 k in case of hd  49641 and by 318 k in case of hd  58368 .",
    "their lower values are likely due to the fact that the color ( b @xmath16 v ) is affected by cn and c@xmath17 , making the stars redder and as a result the temperature derived from this color may be lower ( allen and barbuy 2006 ) .",
    "estimated log g obtained by them using hipparcos parallexes also differ significantly from our estimates .",
    "the chemical abundance estimates of na , al , @xmath18- and iron - peak elements ( o , na , mg , al , si , ca , sc , ti , v , cr , mn , ni ) of yang et al .",
    "are found to be similar to the solar abundances .",
    "overabundances of neutron - capture process elements relative to the sun are noticed in both the stars .",
    "the y i and zr i abundances are lower than ba , la and eu , but higher than the @xmath18- and iron - peak elements . the authors noted a positive correlation between ba intensity and [ ba / fe ] in their sample of stars .",

    "de castro et al . ( 2016 ) : in this work the authors have presented an homogeneous analysis of photospheric abundances based on high - resolution spectroscopy of a sample of 182 barium stars and candidates .",
    "hd  49641 and hd  58368 are two members of this extended sample .",
    "the methodology employed by these authors to derive the stellar parameters are similar to ours . however , there lies significant differences between ours and their estimates of stellar atmospheric parameters , t@xmath3 and surface gravity log g. while de castro et al s estimates for temperature and log g for hd  49641 are 4400 k and 1.5 respectively our estimates are significanltly higher with values 4700 k and 3.4 .",
    "their estimates of the abundances of @xmath18-elements and iron peak elements are similar to those of field giants with the same metallicity .",
    "the observed enrichment in sodium is attributed to the operation of ne - na cycle .",
    "these two stars are also found to exhibit overabundance of the elements created by the s - process . from the measurements of the mean heavy - element abundance pattern",
    "as given by the ratio [ s / fe ] , it was found that the barium stars present several degrees of enrichment . from the measured photospheric abundances of the ba - peak and the zr - peak elements , [ s / fe ] and the [ hs / ls ] ratios ( where hs refers to heavy s - process elements and ls refers to light s - process elements )",

    "it has been argued that a metallicity lower than solar is required to form a barium star .",
    "the increasing levels of heavy - element overabundances observed in the sequence of mild to barium - strong stars support that hypothesis",
