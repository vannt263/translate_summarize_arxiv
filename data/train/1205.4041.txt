    "comparison of the cosmic ray spectra to the predicted synchrotron spectrum is complicated by confusion from competing radio emission sources .",
    "the diffuse radio continuum is a superposition of the cosmic microwave background , synchrotron emission , free - free emission from the warm ionized interstellar medium , and emission from interstellar dust .",
    "a number of authors have attempted to disentangle the various emission sources to determine the synchrotron spectral index ( for a recent review see appendix a of @xcite ) . despite some discrepant results ,",

    "several factors contribute to the observed scatter in estimates of the synchrotron spectral index .",
    "most estimates , particularly those below 23 ghz , assume a power - law spectrum for synchrotron and do not explicitly model spectral steepening .",
    "comparisons between closely - separated frequencies more accurately reflect the local synchrotron spectrum , but have larger uncertainties from competing emission sources or measurement offsets .",
    "analyses with broader frequency coverage reduce foreground and offset uncertainties but average over any spectral steepening .",
    "two additional effects are important for analyses including data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) at frequencies 23 to 94 ghz .",
    "a growing body of evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the diffuse continuum near 23 ghz consists of electric dipole radiation from a population of small , rapidly spinning dust grains @xcite .",
    "spinning dust emission is expected to peak at frequencies near 20 ghz @xcite .",
    "analyses that ignore this component to attribute the observed emission only to synchrotron radiation tend to over - predict the synchrotron amplitude at frequencies near 23 ghz , biasing the derived spectral index to flatter values when comparing to lower frequencies and steeper values when comparing to higher frequencies .",

    "the @xcite survey at 408 mhz is commonly used to model synchrotron emission .",
    "the north galactic pole has measured temperature @xmath22 k at 408 mhz , while a @xmath23 fit to the same 408 mhz map predicts a polar contribution of only @xmath24 k. similar results apply to the southern hemisphere , where the measured polar cap temperature of @xmath25 k significantly exceeds the value @xmath26 k obtained from a @xmath23 fit .",
    "only 2.7 k of the difference can be attributed to emission from the cosmic microwave background , leaving a large residual .",

    "we take the 408 mhz map , remove the 2.7 k cmb monopole , and scale the remaining ( radio ) emission to 23 ghz using a power - law index @xmath27 to produce a toy model of the radio sky at 23 ghz .",
    "following the wmap processing , we then remove a monopole from the scaled map so that the map temperature in the south polar cap matches the @xmath23 fit .",
