    "contemporary galaxy redshift surveys enable the large - scale distribution of galaxies to be accurately mapped in redshift space . compared to the real - space distribution , that in redshift space is distorted as a result of galaxy peculiar velocities , which is generally referred to as redshift space distortions ( rsd ) .",
    "the rsd effects encode information about the kinematics of galaxies inside dark matter haloes and the growth rate of cosmic structure .",
    "the clustering of galaxies in redshift space has been extensively studied using the two - point correlation functions ( 2pcfs ) @xcite .",
    "the widely - used halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modelling of the galaxy 2pcfs provides an opportunity to understand the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the observationally constrained relation between galaxies and dark matter haloes provides insight also about galaxy formation and cosmology .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter g15 ) used the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sloan digital sky survey - iii ( sdss - iii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to model the redshift - space 2pcfs and found differences between galaxy and dark matter velocity distributions inside haloes , an effect denoted as galaxy velocity bias ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "higher - order statistics , e.g. the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , aid in tightening the constraints on hod parameters and in breaking the degeneracy among parameters @xcite .",
    "the 3pcf , @xmath2 , describes the probability of finding galaxy triplets with the separations in between as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a non - zero 3pcf naturally arises because of the non - gaussianity generated during the nonlinear evolution of the density fluctuations , even if primordial fluctuations were perfectly gaussian .",
    "the 3pcf is commonly used to break the degeneracy between the galaxy bias and the amplitude of the matter density fluctuation , and therefore constrains cosmological parameters @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we measure the redshift - space 3pcf for the same sample of lrgs at redshift @xmath6 as in g15 and interpret the 3pcf measurements within the hod framework . in particular , we perform hod modelling of both the 2pcfs and 3pcf and investigate the additional constraining power from the 3pcf on the hod parameters , including the galaxy velocity bias .    in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly describe the galaxy sample , the 3pcf measurements , and the modelling method .",
    "we present our modelling results in section  [ sec : results ] and conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] . throughout this letter",
    "we adopt a spatially flat @xmath7cdm cosmology with a matter density parameter @xmath8 , @xmath9 and a hubble constant @xmath10kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "in this letter , we use the same volume - limited lrg sample as in g15 ( @xmath13-band absolute magnitude @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , selected from sdss - iii boss cmass galaxies @xcite . following @xcite ,",
    "the 3pcf is calculated using the estimator of @xcite .",
    "the triangles are represented in the parametrization of @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the angle between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we use linear binning schemes for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath18 , with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .    to correct for the fibre collision effect in the redshift - space 3pcf , @xmath23",
    ", we assign the redshift of each fibre - collided galaxy from its nearest neighbour @xcite . to further reduce any residual effect on scales slightly larger than the projected fibre collision scale in sdss - iii ( @xmath24 ) @xcite",
    ", we only consider the triangle configurations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which will ensure that all sides of the triangle are larger than @xmath1 .",
    "we measure the redshift - space 3pcf for six @xmath3 bins , centred at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , ... , @xmath29 , with each bin having 10 triangle configurations of different values of @xmath18 .     and @xmath30 , and the angle @xmath18 between them .",
    "from left to right and bottom to top , the plot shows the normalized covariance matrix for the measurements @xmath23 in 10 different @xmath18 bins for @xmath3 centred at 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12@xmath31 .",
    "[ fig : cov ] , scaledwidth=55.0% ]        for hod modelling , we also adopt the 2pcf measurements from g15 and perform a joint fit with the 3pcf , which allows a study of the information content related to the hod constraints from the 3pcf .",
    "the 2pcf measurements include the projected 2pcf ( @xmath32 ) , the monopole ( @xmath33 ) , quadrupole ( @xmath34 ) and hexadecapole moments ( @xmath35 ) of the redshift - space 2pcf from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( see g15 ) .",
    "the full covariance matrix ( including the cross - correlation between the 2pcf and 3pcf measurements ) is estimated from @xmath38 jackknife subsamples ( g15 ) . to reduce the effect of noise in the covariance matrix ,",
    "we apply the method of @xcite and only retain the modes that have eigenvalues @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cov ] displays the covariance matrix of the 3pcf . in each @xmath3 bin , the measurements of different @xmath18 bins are strongly correlated with each other .",
    "the correlation between different @xmath3 bins is stronger for larger @xmath3 , implying better constraints to the model from the measurements at smaller scales .",
    "following g15 , we adopt the five - parameter hod model of @xcite and include two additional velocity bias parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for central and satellite galaxies , respectively .",
    "to model the redshift - space 2pcf , we use the simulation - based model of zheng & guo ( in preparation ; see also g15 ) , which is equivalent to populating haloes in the simulations with galaxies for a given hod prescription .",
    "we use the @xmath42 dark matter halo catalogs from the multidark simulation ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "the haloes are defined using the spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm , with a mean density @xmath43 times that of the background universe at @xmath42 .",
    "the halo centre is defined as the position of the dark matter particle with the minimal potential .",
    "we choose the bulk velocity of the inner @xmath44 percent halo particles around the potential minimum as the halo ( core ) velocity , and the velocity bias is parametrized in this frame , as in g15 .",
    "we place the central galaxies at the halo centres , with their velocities the same as the halo velocities . for satellite galaxies ,",
    "we assign the positions and velocities of randomly - selected dark matter particles .",
    "we then add the velocity bias effect .",
    "the central galaxy velocity bias is parametrized as an additional gaussian component with zero mean and a standard deviation of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles in each halo . for the satellite velocity bias , the relative los velocity of a satellite galaxy to the halo core",
    "is scaled by @xmath41 ( as detailed in g15 ) , therefore the 1d satellite galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath47 is a factor of @xmath41 times that of the dark matter particles , @xmath48 .    to model the 2pcfs and 3pcfs , we apply a markov chain monte carlo method to explore the hod parameter space .",
    "for each set of hod parameters , the 2pcfs are calculated using the simulation - based model ( g15 ) , while the 3pcfs are directly measured from the mock catalogs .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is the sum of the contribution from the correlation functions and that from the number density of the sample .",
    "we explore the constraining power of the 3pcfs on the hod parameters and the need for including velocity bias parameters by considering three cases .",
    "we include @xmath32 in each case , given its common use in constraining the hod and its effectiveness in limiting the parameter space .",
    "first , we perform a joint fit of @xmath32 and the 3pcf @xmath50 with the 5-parameter hod model without velocity bias ( i.e. fixing @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) . this case",
    "is denoted as @xmath53 ( no @xmath54 bias ) .",
    "then , we add @xmath40 and @xmath41 as free parameters in the fitting ( 7 parameters in total ) , which is denoted as @xmath53 . the two cases would indicate whether velocity bias is favoured by the data .",
    "finally , we jointly fit all the 2pcf and 3pcf measurements ( denoted as @xmath55 ) with the 7-parameter model to obtain the hod constraints that explain all our measurements .",
    "the best - fitting model predictions of the 3pcfs for the case of @xmath53 ( no @xmath54 bias ) are shown as dotted blue curves in figure  [ fig : zeta ] .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath49 is 59.6 , for 70 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f.=70 , from 14 @xmath32 points , 60 @xmath50 points , one number density point , and 5 parameters ) .",
    "therefore , the fit without velocity bias is acceptable . comparing the bestfit to the @xmath50 data points",
    ", we notice that on small scales ( @xmath56 ) the model overpredicts @xmath50 over all ranges of @xmath18 , and on large scales it overpredicts @xmath50 for configurations of nearly degenerate triangles ( @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) .",
    "even though we can not judge the fit by eye , given that the data points are correlated , the comparison provides hints to the potential improvements that can be achieved in the modelling .",
    "in particular , the small @xmath49 could indicate that the covariance matrix is overestimated , and the above differences would signal an inadequacy in the model .",
    "we then introduce the velocity bias parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the modelling . with this 7-parameter model ,",
    "the best - fitting @xmath50 is shown as the dashed red curve in each panel of figure  [ fig : zeta ] ( labelled as @xmath32+@xmath50 ) .",
    "compared to the case without velocity bias , the fit clearly improves on both small and large scales in a way as expected from the above discussion .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath49 becomes 46.4 for 68 degrees of freedom .",
    "putting aside the possibility of overestimation of the covariance matrix , we find that both models with and without velocity bias can fit the data well .",
    "then the question is whether adding the velocity bias is preferred . the akaike information criterion ( aic ; @xcite )",
    "provides a quantified way of comparing different models .",
    "it penalizes models with more free parameters , @xmath59 with @xmath60 the number of free parameters . to be more conservative",
    ", we adopt the aic with correction ( aicc ; @xcite ) , @xmath61 with @xmath62 the number of data points , which gives more penalty than @xmath63 to the model with more parameters .",
    "we find the @xmath64 value to be 70.5 and 62.1 for the models without and with velocity bias , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "the model without velocity bias is @xmath65 times as probable as the model with velocity bias .",
    "therefore , the model with velocity bias is preferred by the data , even though it includes two more free parameters .",
    "the possibility that the covariance matrix is overestimated would strengthen this conclusion .",
    "the result also implies that the redshift - space 3pcfs can provide constraints on the velocity bias parameters , which is a point we discuss later .",
    "finally , using the 7-parameter model we perform a joint fit to @xmath32 , @xmath66 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the best - fitting models are shown as the solid black curves in figure  [ fig : zeta ] , which represents the 3pcf measurements remarkably well on all scales .",
    "the overall best - fitting @xmath67 value , to all measurements , is @xmath68 .",
    "there is a slight over - prediction for triangle configurations of @xmath69 on scales of @xmath70 . according to the covariance matrix in figure  [ fig : cov ] , the measurements for these triangle configurations",
    "are strongly correlated among the neighbouring @xmath18 bins , which implies that the fit can not be simply judged by @xmath49-by - eye .",
    "the shaded regions are the @xmath71 uncertainties around this best - fit model . on large scales ( @xmath70 ) , all three models are consistent within the @xmath71 uncertainties , with the @xmath53 ( no @xmath54 bias ) model showing the largest deviation .",
    "the three models are more readily separate on smaller scales , where the contribution of the one - halo term ( i.e. the contribution from intra - halo galaxy triplets ) becomes important .",
    "this result indicates that the small - scale 3pcf measurements are important in discriminating the models and in constraining the galaxy distribution within haloes .",
    "figure  [ fig : hod ] shows the constraints on the hod from different models .",
    "in addition to the models in figure  [ fig : zeta ] , we also include constraints from fitting only 2pcfs statistics ( @xmath32 and @xmath66 ) . the left panel presents the best - fitting mean occupation functions .",
    "the mean occupation functions of central galaxies can already be well constrained by @xmath32 , and the constraints from other models show only small variations .",
    "the well - constrained mean occupation function of central galaxies explains why the 3pcfs on large scales are similar for the different models .",
    "the best - fitting mean occupation functions from @xmath32-only or from including @xmath50 are similar .",
    "including all the 2pcfs and 3pcfs lead to a shallower high - mass slope .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the high - mass slope is large , as indicated by the shaded region ( 1@xmath72 ) for the @xmath73 fit , and the satellite mean occupation functions from the different models are in good agreement .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty in the high - mass slope is even larger if we do not include the 3pcfs .",
    "the 3pcfs thus tighten the constraints on the high - mass slope , as expected from the larger weight towards higher halo mass from the intra - halo galaxy triplets .",
    "however , we do not find substantial tightening for the high - mass slope , which results from the lack of 3pcf measurements on scales below @xmath1 .",
    "the agreement between the mean occupation functions constrained from the @xmath32-only fit and the joint fit , together with the difference in the corresponding model 3pcfs , suggests that galaxy velocity bias can improve the interpretation of the data .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : hod ] shows the velocity bias constraints ( contours of 95% confidence level ) for the three relevant models .",
    "the velocity bias constraints from @xmath74 ( 2pcf only statistics ) are the same as in g15 . when replacing @xmath66 with the redshift - space 3pcf @xmath50 , the velocity bias constraints originate from @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , the red contour in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hod ] shows that the 3pcf data favours the existence of central galaxy velocity bias @xmath40 . note that in this figure",
    ", the @xmath53 ( no @xmath54 bias ) model corresponds to the point at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath40 from fitting @xmath53 is consistent with that from the 2pcf constraints .",
    "the effect of the central velocity bias can be inferred from the comparison between the @xmath53 ( no @xmath54 bias ) fit and the @xmath53 fit with velocity bias for the 3pcfs on large scales in figure  [ fig : zeta ] .",
    "the model with no velocity bias shows an over - prediction of @xmath50 for nearly degenerate triangle configurations ( i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "consider the situation in an overdense region , which appears squashed in redshift space along the line of sight because of large - scale infall .",
    "the effect of the central velocity bias is to smear out the redshift - space distribution of galaxies , making the distribution less squashed .",
    "a less squashed distribution reduces the possibility of finding degenerate triangle configurations , and thus lowers the amplitude of @xmath50 for @xmath75 and @xmath77 , leading to a better fit .    in terms of the satellite velocity bias ,",
    "the 3pcfs prefer to have satellite galaxies moving faster than dark matter ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "such a constraint comes mainly from the small - scale @xmath50 , where the fingers - of - god ( fog ) effect in the redshift - space distribution of galaxies contributes .",
    "the @xmath78 satellite velocity bias , in combination with the central velocity bias , enhances the fog .",
    "this situation causes the galaxy distribution more extended , and such a dilution reduces the possibility of finding small - scale galaxy triplets , lowering the small - scale 3pcf @xmath50 .",
    "this effect clearly explains the difference seen in the small - scale @xmath50 in figure  [ fig : zeta ] between the @xmath53 fits with and without velocity bias .",
    "the satellite velocity bias constraint ( red contour ) from the 3pcfs shows a tentative tension with that ( blue contour ) from the 2pcfs , even though it is at a level of @xmath79 .",
    "if the tension is confirmed with more accurate measurements , the model would need to be improved , e.g. by introducing freedom in the spatial distribution profiles of satellites inside haloes ( see the tests in g15 ) . with the current data , we conclude that combining the measurements of the 2pcfs and the 3pcf significantly strengthens the constraints on the galaxy velocity bias , as demonstrated by the smaller black contour in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hod ] .",
    "in this paper , we measure the redshift - space 3pcfs for a volume - limited sample of lrgs ( @xmath15 ) in the sdss - iii boss cmass dr11 data , and perform hod modelling of the 3pcfs and 2pcfs .",
    "similar to the case with the 2pcfs ( g15 ) , the 3pcf measurements favours the existence of galaxy velocity bias , with which we are able to reproduce the observed galaxy 3pcfs remarkably well on all scales larger than @xmath1 .    by combining with the 2pcfs ,",
    "the galaxy 3pcfs tighten the constraints on the hod parameters , because the three - point distribution is more sensitive to the galaxy occupations in more massive haloes @xcite .",
    "both the redshift - space 2pcfs or 3pcfs can be used to constrain galaxy velocity bias .",
    "either of them leads to a consistent central galaxy velocity bias of around @xmath80 , i.e. on average the central galaxy is in motion with respect to the core of its host halo , corresponding to a 1d velocity dispersion of @xmath81 for halo masses around @xmath82 ( see g15 ) .",
    "the redshift error ( @xmath83 , @xcite ; already accounted for in the model ) alone is not enough to account for the central velocity bias .",
    "as discussed in g15 , such a motion is consistent with those inferred from other observations , including the extrapolation from the measurements in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the satellite velocity distribution is consistent with that of the dark matter from either constraint and from the joint one .    as seen from the covariance matrix and the fitting results , the 3pcfs on small scales ( @xmath84 ) have stronger constraining power on the hod parameters ( including the velocity bias parameters ) .",
    "since we limit our measurements of the 3pcf to scales larger than @xmath1 to reduce the fibre collision effects , we have only small improvements on constraining the satellite occupation function ( compared to those from the 2pcfs ) and the constraints to the phase - space distribution of satellite galaxies within haloes are loose .",
    "the satellite velocity bias is degenerate with the spatial distribution of satellites within dark matter haloes ( see figure 11 of g15 ) .",
    "the 3pcf is more sensitive to the satellite distribution profile , since it probes the profile with triangles of different shapes .",
    "the tentative tension of the satellite velocity bias constraints between using @xmath66 and @xmath50 ( right panel of figure  [ fig : hod ] ) may indicate the departure of the spatial distribution of satellites from that of the dark matter .",
    "therefore , the small - scale 3pcf measurements may serve as a powerful way of understanding the satellite galaxy distribution within haloes and may provide constraints to the halo assembly bias effect @xcite .",
    "we plan to explore such a possibility in our future work by using survey samples free of fibre collision effects and by considering small triplet separations .",
