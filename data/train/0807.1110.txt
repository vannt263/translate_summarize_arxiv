    "lattice simulations of the path integral are a powerful tool to study quantum field theories , especially their non - perturbative properties .",
    "the first step in this program is to find a correct discretisation of the continuum action and its symmetries ( and appropriate discrete observables ) . in that respect",
    "a lot of experience has been collected in the case of gauge and chiral theories",
    ".    there have also been efforts to simulate supersymmetric ( susy ) theories on the lattice for many years . for a quadratic , i.e.  free theory ,",
    "a supersymmetric lattice action can be constructed .",
    "however , one encounters great difficulties in finding more general lattice actions that are invariant under the ( naively ) discretised supersymmetry transformations .",
    "one of them can be traced back to the fact that susy transformations contain derivatives of fields and that the continuum susy actions are invariant up to total derivative terms . in general the corresponding terms on the lattice do not vanish because the leibniz and chain rule of differentiation is violated by any lattice derivative operator @xcite .",
    "the optimal choice in this respect is the slac derivative @xcite , which preserves the leibniz rule in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) ( see @xcite for recent works ) , but leads to non - localities @xcite .",
    "simulations without a realisation of supersymmetry on the lattice @xcite generically suffer from fine - tuning problems in the continuum limit . in higher susy theories it is possible to realise a part of the supersymmetry , and",
    "one can hope that this partial realisation already ensures the correct continuum limit .",
    "many approaches to lattice supersymmetry rely on such constructions , as e.g.  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use a ( nonlinear ) deformation of the continuum transformations on the lattice @xcite .",
    "one then still has to show that such lattice transformations resemble the susy transformations in the continuum limit even in the presence of quantum corrections to all orders of perturbation theory , as done for a specific model in  @xcite .",
    "this can ensure the correct continuum limit of these deformed transformations , but a non - perturbative argument would be desirable . a further attempt to keep the full susy by representing it on non - commutative objects or link objects @xcite has been criticised in @xcite . for more details on lattice supersymmetry",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of all these studies seems to be that there is a fundamental obstacle against interacting local lattice theories with exact susy implemented in the naive way .",
    "this situation resembles very much that of chiral theories on the lattice .",
    "the nielsen - ninomiya theorem @xcite forbids exact chiral symmetry on the lattice under a few very reasonable assumptions like locality .",
    "ginsparg and wilson have derived a modified symmetry relation for a chiral lattice theory @xcite ; in particular , the lattice dirac operator anticommutes with @xmath0 except for a term that vanishes in the continuum limit @xmath1 . a solution to this relation",
    "was found by neuberger @xcite , which is not ultra - local @xcite , but local if the background gauge field is smooth ( the plaquette is close to the identity ) @xcite .",
    "the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation is not a mere modification of the naive lattice symmetry with terms that formally vanish in the limit @xmath1 ; its justification is the analysis of the wilsonian renormalisation group @xcite , for the general setting see also @xcite .",
    "thus it is a non - perturbative construction of a deformed symmetry transformation .",
    "our strategy in putting supersymmetry on the lattice is therefore to revisit the corresponding procedure ( this was already suggested in @xcite and some earlier but incomplete attempts can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it leads to a lattice theory in an effective wilsonian sense .",
    "this can be viewed as integrating out quantum fluctuations up to a finite number of lattice degrees of freedom , the integration over which is performed numerically .",
    "it is well - known that in such a process of quantisation classical symmetries get deformed .",
    "the aim of the present work is not only to extend the ginsparg - wilson approach to supersymmetry .",
    "we will also generalise the investigations of ginsparg and wilson for an arbitrary linear symmetry .",
    "the reduction of the degrees of freedom is done with an appropriate blocking transformation and the results will depend on the choice of a blocking kernel .    if only a quadratic theory is considered the effective lattice action for a given continuum action can be calculated .",
    "this was done in @xcite for a supersymmetric model .",
    "here we are not attempting to find such explicit solutions , since this is possible only for a free theory .",
    "rather we investigate the implications of a continuum symmetry for the effective lattice action .",
    "if these implications are fulfilled a symmetric theory should be approached in the continuum limit .    as our main result , we derive an exact relation that a lattice theory has to obey in order to represent the continuum symmetry . also interacting theories",
    "are included in this generalisation of the gw relation to a general linear symmetry .",
    "by contrast , the gw relation deals only with the chiral symmetry acting on the quadratic fermion part of the action ; the gauge fields are mere spectators .",
    "as in the gw case the naive lattice symmetry will be modified by terms that are proportional to the inverse blocking kernel .",
    "if this relation should represent a proper lattice symmetry certain conditions , especially locality , must be satisfied .",
    "these conditions exclude e.g.  the wilson operator as a solution for chiral symmetry .    applying the formalism to supersymmetry with its derivative transformations ,",
    "an additional constraint has to be fulfilled in order to derive a lattice remnant of the continuum symmetry .",
    "the solution of this constraint generically leads to the non - local slac operator in the lattice transformations .",
    "we also investigate the continuum limit of the blocking kernel , which is less restrictive .",
    "we are able to solve the relation for the quadratic ( kinetic plus mass ) sector of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) . in the case of this one - dimensional toy model",
    "the relation already yields non - trivial difference operators  analogues of the overlap operator for the case of supersymmetry .",
    "the locality of these derivative operators can be improved using the freedom in the blocking kernel .",
    "this is an important result of our strategy : the blocking kernel helps in achieving the desired properties of the lattice theory , ` at the expense of ' introducing a rhs in the lattice symmetry relation rendering it different from the naive one .",
    "concerning interacting susy theories , the symmetry relation generically couples different powers of the fields in the action beyond second order .",
    "it is therefore very intricate to truncate the interaction in the power of fields . as an example displaying these difficulties we solve the case of constant fields in susyqm . for general theories we give a necessary criterion for the construction of polynomial interactions .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : first we introduce the blocking procedure in detail and derive the symmetry relation .",
    "it is particularly simple when a quadratic action is considered , and for chiral symmetry we recover the gw relation .",
    "the next section is devoted to the additional constraint and its solutions .",
    "their continuum limit as well as the continuum limit of the blocking kernel is analysed carefully in sect .",
    "[ sec : contlim ] .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : quadact ] we start to apply the approach to susyqm , giving the general solution for the quadratic case and discussing its properties , especially locality . afterwards in sect .",
    "[ sec : interacting ] we solve the constant field case and investigate the possibility of polynomial actions fulfilling the symmetry relation , both in general and for susy .",
    "we end with a summary of our results and a discussion of their implications .",
    "in this chapter the wilsonian effective action computed from a general blocking transformation is introduced .",
    "the key result of the following investigation are the blocked symmetry transformations .",
    "these are specified later for the case of supersymmetry .",
    "the simple form of the symmetry transformations in case of a quadratic action is derived in section  [ sec : quadaction ] . with this result",
    "the general concepts are elucidated at the example of chiral symmetry where the well - known ginsparg - wilson relation is reproduced .",

    "the theory is reduced to a finite number of degrees of freedom by introducing averaged or blocked fields @xmath5 at lattices sites @xmath6 by a linear blocking procedure , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lattice distance , and a blocking function @xmath9 peaked at @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 should have the dimension inverse to the @xmath11-dimensional integral , such that the original and blocked fields have the same dimension .",
    "this blocking can be easily generalised to finite blocking steps and fields @xmath12 where @xmath13 comprises internal indices and species of fields .",
    "then a general blocking reads @xmath14 where a summation / integration over indices is understood .",
    "the blocking matrix @xmath15 is rectangular , and usually relates only the same species , but in general it also mixes the internal indices . in @xmath16 can be a discrete index , then @xmath17 is already understood as a blocked continuum field @xmath18 . in that case",
    "the blocking maps a lattice with a smaller lattice spacing and consequently more degrees of freedom onto a smaller one with a larger lattice spacing .",
    "the blocking procedure amounts to rewriting the generating functional @xmath19 in eqn .   in terms of a path integral on the lattice defined by the image of @xmath9 .",

    "we briefly discuss a specifically simple case with @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "then the smearing term turns into a @xmath33-function in field space , @xmath34 and the smearing is removed .",
    "removing the smearing in the continuum limit , @xmath1 , is necessary in order to recover the original action in this limit , @xmath35 , apart from the blocking @xmath9 becoming the delta - distribution , that is @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , for achieving , @xmath37 has to diverge .",

    "+      the primary concern of this construction is the blocking transformation of symmetries of the classical action .",
    "we now investigate in what form the lattice action inherits this symmetry",
    ". our main result will be the relation that corresponds to the ginsparg - wilson relation , but is valid for a general linear symmetry .",
    "continuum implementations of the related ideas close to the present line of arguments can be found in e.g.@xcite , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "let the classical action @xmath41 be invariant under a linear transformation @xmath42 where @xmath43 in general relates different field species @xmath44 , but may also act non - trivially on the coordinates ( @xmath16,@xmath45 ) .",

    "indeed , the transformation can be lifted to @xmath29 as @xmath51 with a lattice transformation @xmath52 , if @xmath53 holds .",

    "we shall exemplify this statement in section  [ sec : chiral ] at the standard wilson dirac operator that explicitly breaks chiral symmetry , but still satisfies .",
    "the question arises what are the additional conditions on @xmath90 that make it to a deformed symmetry . for local continuum",
    "symmetries it is important that the corresponding lattice version of the symmetry carries this locality .",
    "more generally , for a given symmetry the blocking should only induce a local symmetry breaking or deformation generated by @xmath9 and @xmath30 .",
    "consequently we are led to two conditions :    * a mandatory condition for a deformed lattice symmetry is the locality of @xmath89 .",
    "this guarantees a well - defined continuum limit in which the lattice artefacts related to the deformation tend to zero in a controlled way as they are local .",
    "hence , in order to have a deformed symmetry the family of blockings @xmath91 must contain at least one blocking @xmath92 that leads to a local symmetry operator @xmath89 .",

    "locality of @xmath89 reads @xmath93 for some @xmath94 . in the present investigation",
    "we shall relax , and demand @xmath95 for explanations see appendix  [ app : local ] .",

    "* @xmath89 has to carry the original continuum symmetry related to the symmetry operator @xmath43 .",
    "this condition excludes e.g.  the trivial solution @xmath96 . for this solution",
    "it is clear that the symmetry pattern of the lattice action is not entailed in @xmath97 , and @xmath97 does not tend towards the continuum symmetry @xmath43 in the continuum limit .",
    "we can summarise this condition in the demand that @xmath97 is identical to the continuum symmetry operator @xmath98 up to lattice artefacts at @xmath99 , where the continuum limit is located .",
    "hence , the condition that @xmath97 carries the continuum symmetry can be formulated as @xmath100 note that @xmath101 only for @xmath102 in the continuum , see the discussion in section [ sec : contlimgen ] .",
    "the above conditions - should be seen as a definition of a deformed symmetry , and put constraints on the blocking kernel @xmath30 . in order to formally obtain a symmetric continuum limit",
    ", one might use actions without such a symmetry , but the above considerations guarantee the existence of a local lattice symmetry for every finite lattice spacing that converges locally towards the continuum symmetry .",
    "the latter property is very important for a successful numerical implementation .    in the case of lattice supersymmetry",
    "the question is whether such a deformed symmetry operator @xmath89 according to this definition can be constructed .",
    "the general results above simplify greatly for quadratic actions @xmath103 with the kernel @xmath104 comprising kinetic and mass terms . at first sight",
    "this case seems trivial as it describes a free field theory .",
    "nonetheless , it already includes the non - trivial case of ginsparg - wilson fermions @xcite with background gauge fields , see the next subsection .",
    "moreover , locality of a symmetry operator @xmath97 of an interacting theory relates directly to the locality of its kinetic non - interacting part .    with this action the general symmetry relation simplifies to @xmath105 in many cases",
    "the second line vanishes . in case of field",
    "independent transformation matrices @xmath52 and kinetic operators @xmath104 it anyway is just an irrelevant constant .",
    "however , in the case of anomalous symmetries it contributes to the anomaly .",
    "if one considers non - quadratic actions the corresponding term in general becomes @xmath29-dependent .",
    "the first line in has to be valid for general fields @xmath29 and hence we conclude that @xmath106 again the minus signs appear on the left and right hand side only if fermions are transformed into fermions by the naive symmetry @xmath54 .",
    "the interesting information in the symmetry relation is that of the propagation of symmetry breaking on the lattice . this propagation can be seen from @xmath107 this equation high - lightens how the breaking of the symmetry by the blocking matrix @xmath30 and the breaking by the kernel @xmath104 must compensate each other .",

    "we find a @xmath29-independent @xmath89 with @xmath113 @xmath89 may , however , now depend on background fields via @xmath104 and @xmath112 , e.g.  link variables if @xmath104 is the dirac operator .",
    "note that defines a family of symmetry matrices , as @xmath83 is a general symmetric matrix satisfying .",
    "for the modified symmetry the relation reads @xmath114 as already mentioned in the previous section , in general does not comprise a symmetry , as the above construction applies to any kinetic operator .",
    "thus , in general only disguises an explicit symmetry breaking induces by the blocking kernel .",
    "we also clearly see the necessity of the second condition : for @xmath115 we have @xmath116 and hence @xmath96 .",

    "one should not only insinst on the locality of the action . to get a well defined representation of the symmetry on the lattice",

    "we take @xmath323",
    "if @xmath166 vanishes in the continuum limit , it follows that @xmath324 , and hence @xmath325 and @xmath326 .    demanding that @xmath89 is a symmetry of the lattice action @xmath104 , eqn .",

    "the reason for the absence of locality problems is that the slac operator from the blocked lattice symmetry @xmath54 has not appeared yet .    the deformed symmetry must , however , not only be a local symmetry of the lattice action .",
    "a further condition , eq .  , implies a relation between @xmath54 and @xmath89 .",
    "this additional condition is a direct consequence of the symmetry relation .",
    "since @xmath166 is so far undetermined it is apparently not difficult to satisfy this condition . but",
    "restrictions of the lattice action , due to e.g.hermiticity , impose further constraints on the blocking kernel . in the case of supersymmetry",
    "these constraint are of great importance since @xmath166 can only connect fermions with fermions whereas @xmath89 connects fermions and bosons with each other .",
    "so one has to investigate whether or not there exists an @xmath166 to ensure that this deformed symmetry @xmath89 is indeed the result of a blocking procedure and hence fulfils @xmath330 . as @xmath54 is not invertible we use a general ansatz for @xmath166 , namely @xmath331 and compare the two sides of @xmath332 yielding @xmath333 the lower left block of this matrix equation can be satisfied by an appropriate choice of @xmath334 , @xmath335 and @xmath336 . the upper right block fixes @xmath337 and in addition implies @xmath338 together with this yields @xmath339 we remind the reader that @xmath340 is the slac derivative appearing in the lattice symmetry @xmath54 due to the additional constraint and @xmath341 and @xmath287 are the matrices for the @xmath291 and the kinetic fermion term in the lattice action , which both should be local .",

    "the only remaining problem arises since @xmath341 vanishes at the boundaries of the brillouin zone .",
    "this means that the on - shell bosonic mass term inherits a divergence @xmath345 at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "hence an on - shell problem is expected although the off - shell action is local in the sense of condition .",
    "it is instructive to recall that these results rely on the specific structure of the transformations in the case of supersymmetry .",
    "they transform fermions into bosons and vice versa .",
    "by contrast the blocking matrix and the action relates fermions with fermions and bosons with bosons . in case of other symmetries the transformations , @xmath166 , and @xmath104 would have the same block diagonal structure , which makes it easier to find a local solution for @xmath104 and @xmath89 .",
    "one may still wonder whether the current approach can be generalised to get a result that satisfies the more severe condition for locality . to investigate this problem we look at the relation @xmath346 ( see ) , where only the symmetric part of @xmath83 of the blocking appears . to get an exponential decay for both @xmath89 and the action @xmath104",
    ", also @xmath347 has to fulfil this condition .",
    "the slac - derivative in the generator @xmath54 , , violates the locality of this matrix . taking the most general @xmath83 , , the only entries of @xmath347 are @xmath348 ( @xmath349 for the second supersymmetry , @xmath350 ) and the same matrix multiplied by the slac - derivative .",
    "so both @xmath348 and @xmath351 must be local .",
    "in analogy to @xmath341 and @xmath352 we conclude that it is impossible to get an exponential decay on the lattice for both matrices .",
    "so the condition and not can be fulfilled for both @xmath89 and @xmath104 .",
    "the final goal of our investigations of lattice susy is to write down a lattice action for an interacting theory . according to the usual argument , that is not blocking inspired ,",
    "a supersymmetric lattice action for the quadratic case can be found .",
    "the lattice supersymmetry transformations are in that case defined as the continuum transformations with the derivative operator replaced by a local lattice derivative .",
    "for the case of a quadratic action we have given a solution above , that preserves the modified symmetry and is hence guided by the blocking of the symmetry . in this case",
    "it is also possible to derive a direct solution of the blocking transformations , cf .",

    "we go back to the original equation which provides a systematic relation to be fulfilled in order to keep the considered symmetry .",
    "the solutions are , however , much more complicated than in the quadratic case .",
    "this can already be observed by an analysis of a specific solvable example , namely constant fields in susyqm , which gives nontrivial results and displays a new issue : the polynomial nature of the action .      in this subsection",
    "we work with the same parametrisations for @xmath52 , @xmath279 and @xmath166 , see and , but study only constant fields @xmath353 and so on .",
    "this amounts to the zero mode sector of the lattice derivative @xmath183 , i.e.  we can replace @xmath354 .",
    "note that in this approximation @xmath266 is invariant under the naive lattice transformations .",
    "of course , locality will not be an issue for this toy model .    for the action we use the following ansatz",

    "we consider those , that consist of a term @xmath361 plus terms linear in @xmath266 with an arbitrary @xmath265-dependence , such that the auxiliary field @xmath266 can be integrated out easily .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath362 , which should include the ` kinetic term ' , that in the zero mode sector degenerates to @xmath363 .",
    "indeed , any function @xmath364 is a solution of eq .   in this case .    the case @xmath365 resembles an additional mass term .",
    "the corresponding solution @xmath366 becomes @xmath367 in the limit @xmath302 as required . for finite @xmath293",
    "we obtain a bosonic mass different from @xmath286 and an additional term proportional to @xmath368 .",
    "this action could also be gotten from section  [ sec : quadr_susy ] , eqn.s and - , since putting @xmath369 there also yields different bosonic and fermionic mass and a @xmath368-term surviving from @xmath284 .",
    "the most interesting case is an interacting theory with a truly @xmath265-dependent term @xmath370 .",
    "for the lowest possible power @xmath371 one obtains the common yukawa interaction .",
    "the general solution of is again restricted by the requirement that for vanishing constants @xmath293 the term @xmath359 should resemble the continuum result @xmath372 .",
    "one obtains the non - polynomial solution @xmath373 which upon expanding in @xmath310 becomes polynomial @xmath374 now it is obvious that the correct continuum limit is approached and that this interaction term does not diverge in the limit @xmath375 as one might have expected from .",
    "note that in the zero mode sector there is no failure of the leibniz rule .",
    "hence the direct translations of the continuum action are naively supersymmetric fulfilling which amounts to setting @xmath376 ( in other words using a susy preserving blocking @xmath79 ) .",
    "the presented solutions are deformations thereof .",
    "already in the simple case of constant fields these deformations lead to a non - polynomial solutions if an interacting theory is considered .",
    "one might expect that the non - polynomial form of the action is a generic consequence of the symmetry relation , not only for supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , similar results have been obtained in the context of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this in the next sections as well as the circumstances under which a polynomial action like is possible .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection it seems difficult to find a polynomial solution of the lattice symmetry relation beyond second order . in the following",
    "we argue that a non - polynomial action is indeed the generic solution of this relation for an arbitrary linear symmetry .",
    "only if special conditions are fulfilled , the series in the fields can be truncated . to show this general behaviour we generalise the considerations of section [ sec : quadaction ] to interacting systems .",

    "the purely quadratic case @xmath381 ( and @xmath382 ) has been discussed in section [ sec : quadact ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath104 are so far not further specified , they can imply a simple multiplication of fields at the same lattice point , but are also allowed to contain lattice derivatives or to smear the powers of the fields over several lattice sites , as long as they obey the correct continuum limit .",
    "the relation is in general a complicated nonlinear differential equation coupling derivatives with respect to the fields at different lattice points .",
    "an expansion in the order of the fields using the ansatz yields    @xmath383    where we used a short - hand notation without indices .",
    "these coupled equations can be read as restrictions for the @xmath384 parametrising @xmath379 imposed by the symmetry . in the case of @xmath377@xmath385@xmath386",
    "only the conditions , are relevant giving .    for interacting theories , @xmath387 , a set of equations with vanishing left hand sides , eqn.s , appears .",
    "the very difficulty to obtain a polynomial solution is to fulfil these equations with a finite number of interacting terms @xmath388 $ ] ( which in addition shall give the desired theories in the continuum ) .",
    "if this turns out to be impossible for some order @xmath377 , this order has to be increased and finally one might be forced to non - polynomial interactions .    as an example we consider the relation of the highest order @xmath389 , which reads @xmath390 and can be rewritten in matrix - vector notation as @xmath391 this relation is a severe constraint , because it implies that @xmath392 within the subspace of lattice fields spanned by the @xmath393 . if the @xmath393 span the whole space of @xmath394 , the relation is immediately reduced to the naive symmetry .",
    "if the @xmath393 do not span the whole space of the fields they must be linearly dependent . then some linear combinations of the @xmath395 vanish and from the definition it is clear that the highest part of the action @xmath396 does not depend on some particular combinations of fields . on this subspace",
    "there is no constraint like .",
    "so after all it is only possible to get a truncation of the action , if is fulfilled on that subspace of @xmath29 s , on which the highest term of the action , @xmath396 , depends . keeping translational invariance , it is impossible to have @xmath396 independent of fields at particular lattice points @xmath187 , but @xmath396 may be independent of a whole field component ( @xmath397 ) of the multiplet .",
    "such a case appears in the case of constant fields ( see eq .  )",
    "when @xmath310 is set to zero .",
    "then the highest term of the action , @xmath398 , depends only on @xmath265 , and @xmath399 has no matrix entries for this field component . in this way",
    "a polynomial solution can be achieved .",
    "we stress that so far we only discussed one necessary condition for a truncation of the action down to a polynomial .",
    "the remaining equations - need to be solved as well .",
    "the continuum limit of the resulting actions needs in general a careful investigation since additional interaction terms must be introduced to solve the relation .",
    "these terms have no corresponding continuum counterparts and should vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "it is easy to ensure this in a naive way , where one just introduces the appropriate power of the lattice spacing , @xmath8 , in front of the terms to let them vanish when @xmath8 goes to zero .",
    "notice , however , that the additional interaction terms introduce new vertices in a perturbative expansion . because of divergences ( for @xmath400 ) the corresponding diagrams are not necessarily vanishing even though the vertices themselves vanish",
    ". so it seems non - trivial to find the correct form of the action in the continuum limit .",
    "the situation gets even more difficult if the truncation constraint is not fulfilled .",
    "then one has to accept a non - polynomial actions . beside the feasibility of such actions for numerical simulations",
    ", one has to analyse fundamental aspects of them like renormalisability .",
    "nevertheless , these solutions obey the deformed lattice symmetry that approaches the continuum one in the continuum limit .",
    "this limits the possible actions , e.g.  by relating the different couplings , and might even determine the entire form of the action .",
    "how the discussion specialises to supersymmetry will be discussed in the next subsection .      to illustrate the above rather formal general statements ,",
    "we specify them to susy theories . for the sake of the argument we consider now a higher order action of susyqm",
    ", other susy theories will lead to a similar situation .",
    "we mimic the interaction term of the continuum theory , @xmath401 ( see eq .   with @xmath402 ) , by the following lattice action : @xmath403 with parameters @xmath104 and @xmath404 as in .",
    "the ( super)vector @xmath405 following from this action reads @xmath406 it is not hard to see that @xmath405 takes all values in the considered space of lattice fields upon varying the fields @xmath407 at all lattice sites .",
    "the rationale for this is , as explained above , the ` completeness ' of the highest term in the action @xmath408 , eq .  , if it contains all fields of the multiplet . as a consequence ,",
    "has to be fulfilled in general , but this reduces the symmetry relation to the naive symmetry .",
    "one can easily convince oneself that the same argument applies to all continuum - inspired actions of the form @xmath409 .",
    "there are two options to proceed at this point .",
    "the first one is to accept non - polynomial actions like , which induces many new complications .",
    "the second and rather intricate possibility is to fulfil only on a subspace of the fields . for susy",
    "this can be achieved , e.  g. , by building the highest order term ( in this case @xmath408 ) out of purely bosonic or purely fermionic fields . as @xmath81 has only entries mixing bosons and fermions is fulfilled easily in this way .",
    "we repeat the constant field result , where setting @xmath410 and @xmath411 in eq .",
    "the highest term is of the form @xmath398 . in the present case with ` smearing ' in @xmath104 , such a term could be represented as @xmath412 .",
    "of course , such incomplete parts of the actions on their own are not giving the desired continuum limit since in the continuum susy actions all fields are present at any given order ( i.e.  in every @xmath379 ) .",
    "the only meaning such terms could have is to be lattice artifacts needed to solve the symmetry relation at finite lattice spacing and to vanish in the continuum limit , such that the continuum action contains only terms of lower order in the fields .",
    "again , in this approach we so far have discussed only the highest relation . to solve the remaining relations is a non - trivial task to be done in further investigations .    with the help of such additional terms it might be possible to fulfil the symmetry relation which then guarantees the ( super)symmetry in the continuum limit",
    "in this work we have systematically approached lattice supersymmetry , and have extended the ginsparg - wilson relation to general linear symmetries and interacting theories .    for a general blocking procedure",
    "we have derived a lattice relation , eq .",
    ", from the continuum symmetry of the theory at hand .",
    "this relation can be viewed as the ` remnant ' of the continuum symmetry on the lattice , and has to be satisfied by the lattice action .",
    "the relation also includes potential anomalies and reduces to the well - known ginsparg - wilson relation for chiral theories .",
    "as this relation is derived for all possible blockings it does in general not comprise a lattice symmetry , but rather describes the breaking of the continuum symmetry by the blocking procedure .",
    "it can be interpreted as a deformed symmetry only for those blockings for which the symmetry operator in is local , as defined in , and tends towards the continuum symmetry operator in the continuum limit .",
    "these important properties are discussed in section  [ sec : localityofmdef ] .",
    "these requirements exclude for instance the wilson fermion action as a solution for a chiral lattice theory .",
    "interestingly enough , the averaging function @xmath9 defines the lattice formulation , but does not appear in the relation of the lattice action .",
    "instead , @xmath9 is involved in an additional constraint encountered in the derivation of the relation .",
    "this constraint is of particular importance when the symmetry transformations include derivatives , which is one of the characteristic features of supersymmetry ( as opposed to e.g.  the algebraic @xmath0-transformations in the chiral case ) . in order to keep the resolution of the averaging function as demanded by the lattice cutoff",
    ", the derivative operator in the lattice transformations must be the slac derivative or approach the slac derivative in the continuum limit .",
    "such a non - local operator is of course problematic in view of the locality of lattice action and symmetry .",
    "the other ingredient of the blocking transformation , the blocking kernel @xmath30 , appears explicitly in the symmetry relation of the lattice action .",
    "an @xmath30 that respects the symmetry leads to a vanishing rhs of this relation and thus to a naive symmetry . for chiral theories",
    "this is forbidden because of vector symmetry . in case of supersymmetry",
    "a symmetric @xmath26 can in principle be chosen , but the resulting deformed symmetry would then contain the slac derivative and hence be non - local .",
    "the corresponding invariant lattice actions inherit this problem .",
    "thus we are lead to non - symmetric @xmath30 s and a non - vanishing rhs of our relation to have a chance to obtain local lattice actions and local symmetry transformations for supersymmetry .    in the concrete example of quadratic susyqm",
    "one can find how @xmath30 improves the locality of the action : an ultra - local @xmath166 introduces propagator - like denominators in the lattice operators , which however are not enough to compensate for the non - locality of the emerging slac operator . considering @xmath166 as a momentum - dependent quantity allows ( ultra- ) local lattice actions as a solution of the symmetry relation . beside the lattice action",
    "also the deformed lattice symmetry must be local . to get a connection to the blocking procedure ,",
    "only a relaxed version of locality can be guaranteed ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : local_symmetry ] ) .",
    "hence this rather simple example already reveals a lot about the interplay of the blocking ingredients , the locality of actions and symmetries on the lattice .",
    "one of the main differences between susy and chiral theories is that the symmetry of the former acts on non - quadratic terms .",
    "correspondingly , the relation for lattice susy extends beyond second order and couples different powers of fields .",
    "we have discussed that this generically results in non - polynomial actions .",
    "this finding is not completely surprising as our construction is half way towards the full quantum effective action : we integrate out the original fields and represent the remaining path integral in terms of the blocked lattice fields .",
    "the non - polynomial actions are derived from the continuum theory in a prescribed way .",
    "one might for instance speculate that certain cancellations between bosons and fermions are still present and help to renormalise the system .",
    "we have given a necessary condition for a truncation in the action .",
    "indeed , in the very special example of constant fields in susyqm this criterion could be satisfied and the action is local .",
    "we conclude with a short outlook . to date , the main problem for performing susy lattice simulations is the implementation of the symmetry .",
    "we hope to use the blocking formalism to obtain local interacting theories , which are invariant under a local deformed symmetry .",
    "the corresponding solutions to the symmetry relation should either be obtained through reasonable approximations or by a resummation .",

    "in addition one easily observes that the fourier components of @xmath49 and the lattice fields are determined by @xmath9 , which means that @xmath9 introduces a cutoff for the lattice momentum if @xmath196 vanishes for all @xmath197 greater than the cutoff .",
    "the additional constraint reads after partial integration @xmath437 because of the circulant form of @xmath183 ( cf .  )",

    "the result of the fourier transformation again fulfils @xmath441 and @xmath442 has the same periodicity ( which means it is one only for @xmath443 and otherwise zero ) .        in this appendix",
    "we discuss solutions @xmath183 of the additional constraint which are ultra - local .",
    "these include the ( slightly modified ) symmetric difference , , and extensions thereof spreading over neighbours at larger distances , e.g .. they come with blocking functions @xmath9 extended over the whole volume , , or subvolumes , depending on how many fourier components @xmath9 can have . in section  [ sec : cont_f ]",
    "we have argued that only the @xmath9 with the highest resolution @xmath445 leads to a reasonable , namely non - redundant lattice theory .",
    "this amounts to @xmath183 being the slac operator .",
    "although the use of these ultra - local @xmath183 s is questionable , we nevertheless want to point out that doublers in them can be removed . for supersymmetric theories",
    "it is natural that also bosons have a doubling problem @xcite , so we investigate the kinetic operator in the bosonic sector , too .      to resolve the doubler problem we make use of the fact , that the matrix @xmath285 in our ansatz and in - is only restricted to be symmetric and circulant . in the spirit of the wilson term",
    ", we will now replace @xmath285 by @xmath446 with @xmath380 a dimensionless parameter .",
    "such a momentum - dependent correction will then also occur in @xmath286 through our solution , it is the simplest to change @xmath285 .",
    "one could also have solved @xmath447 and then change @xmath286 . ] and all  bosonic and fermionic  doublers are removed as long as the parameter @xmath308 remains small .",
    "we consider massless fields @xmath449 .",
    "then because of @xmath450 and @xmath451 it is clear that the bilinears @xmath452 according to - have zeroes at vanishing @xmath453 as they should . at the edge of the brillouin zone , @xmath454 , they would vanish as well because of @xmath455 , if there were no @xmath380-corrections .",
    "the finite value @xmath456 , however , removes the doublers since @xmath457 these values are non - zero and scale depending on the behaviour of the @xmath293 .",
    "what remains to be shown is that there are no other zeroes at intermediate values of @xmath453 .",
    "for that we specialise to the solution of @xmath183 ranging to next - to - nearest neighbours with @xmath458 from eqn.s , and plot in fig.[fig : disp_relations ] the operators @xmath301 and @xmath297 in momentum space . as @xmath301 and @xmath286",
    "are real symmetric ( also after including @xmath380 ) , their fourier transforms are real , whereas that of the real antisymmetric @xmath287 is purely imaginary . in order to seek for zeroes , we therefore plot @xmath459 and @xmath460 , both as functions of @xmath453 .",
    "as one can see from that figure , the doublers are removed and no additional zeroes appear , unless @xmath308 is too big .",
    "let us discuss how the symmetry relation emerges in the setting of section [ sec : contlimgen ] with currents .",
    "here we take the point of view that the wilsonian action @xmath41 is defined to give the same generating functional @xmath229 $ ] in , @xmath461 = \\0{1}{\\norm e^{\\s012 j\\alpha^{-1 } j } }   \\int\\d\\phi\\ , e^{-\\sw[\\phi]+ j\\phi } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all currents @xmath230 as the classical action in , .@xmath462=\\0{1}\\norm\\int",
    ", e^{-\\sc[\\varphi]+ j \\phi_f[\\varphi ] } \\ , . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields the same expectation values for all observables composed out of the blocked fields @xmath49 .",
    "now performing a symmetry variation @xmath463 on the classical fields @xmath75 and changing the integration variable in accordingly , one gets to @xmath464 : @xmath465=\\0{1}{\\norm}\\int d\\varphi \\ , e^{-\\sc[\\varphi]+ j \\phi_f[\\varphi]}\\epsilon j \\phi_f[{\\tilde{m}}\\varphi]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term can be rewritten as @xmath466 $ ] using the additional constraint .",
    "then it is just the change of @xmath229 $ ] under @xmath467 , @xmath468=z_f[j+\\epsilon j m]-z_f[j]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be computed in the representation , where again we change the integration variable @xmath469 .",
    "this yields a @xmath470 part , the variation of @xmath41 and a bilinear term in @xmath230 from the variation of the prefactor : @xmath471\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the currents in the last term can be rewritten as @xmath29-derivatives of @xmath472 in @xmath229 $ ] and , by partial integration , of @xmath473)$ ] : @xmath474 + j\\phi }    \\big\\{\\str{\\tilde{m}}- \\str\\m+\\delta s\\nonumber\\\\    & & - e^{\\sw[\\phi]}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}m{\\alpha^{-1}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}e^{-\\sw[\\phi]}\\big\\ } z_f[j]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] demanding this equality for all currents @xmath230 , the curly bracket in the integrand has to vanish giving and thus our symmetry relation .    notice",
    "that we have used the same ingredients as in the original derivation of the relation , including the additional constraint and the inverse blocking kernel @xmath166 , but we have not relied on the definition of the wilsonian action based on @xmath30 itself .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : contlimgen ] extend to @xmath30 s with some diverging matrix elements @xmath475 .",
    "the corresponding eigenmodes @xmath476 with @xmath477 are fixed : @xmath478 $ ] .",
    "the remaining modes in @xmath29 still undergo the smearing procedure .",
    "the other extremal case is @xmath479 , where @xmath480 is the projection operator on the singular part of @xmath138 .",
    "still is valid but the definitions of the wilsonian action and the normalisation develop singularities . if we want to keep these definition we could simply change the generating functional @xmath229 $ ] to @xmath481 $ ] which generates correlation functions @xmath482 . here",
    "@xmath483 with @xmath484",
    ". then the above derivations are unaltered with @xmath485 and @xmath486 . with this procedure",
    "we have removed the @xmath487-modes from our theory .",
    "in particular the definition of the wilsonian action with @xmath488 leads to @xmath489=s[\\phi_{\\rm reg}]$ ] .",
    "the restrictions of the blocking matrix originate from the hermiticity of the lattice action .",
    "in addition , the most general blocking matrix @xmath490 should connect fermionic and bosonic fields only among each other .",
    "therefore , the form of its inverse is restricted to be @xmath491 where @xmath492 has to be antisymmetric , whereas all other matrices are symmetric . in order to get translation invariance",
    "all matrices must be circulant .",
    "the most general symmetric matrix , fulfilling with the symmetry operators @xmath54 and @xmath493 defined by and , is @xmath494 where @xmath495 is an antisymmetric and @xmath496 a symmetric circulant matrix .",
    "such a symmetric part , @xmath83 , can always be added to @xmath166 without changing the relation .",
    "so the matrix elements of @xmath497 can be reduced without any loss of generality concerning the modified symmetry using the freedom of choosing @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "we choose them to be @xmath498 and define @xmath499 where all @xmath293 are now symmetric circulant matrices .",
    "the resulting matrix with reduced matrix elements compared to @xmath500 is just the one given in equation .",
    "since @xmath83 is not important for the deformed symmetry of the action the result is not changed compared to @xmath500 .",
    "however , the deformed symmetry @xmath89 depends on this part .",
    "so if one wants to investigate the locality of @xmath89 the most general blocking matrix @xmath500 instead of the @xmath166 must be considered .    from these considerations",
    "it is clear that all entries of @xmath166 can in principle be zero after splitting off @xmath83 .",
    "then the blocking matrix would consist only of a symmetric part @xmath294 .",
    "this was done in @xcite where @xmath501 with @xmath502 was used .",
    "the lattice symmetry is in that case reduced to the naive one .      in this appendix",
    "we discuss the locality properties of the operators - with momentum - independent @xmath293 , which due to the denominators resemble massive propagators .",
    "nonetheless , we will demonstrate that the position space representations of these operators do not decay exponentially on the lattice .",
    "let us , as common in the discussion of locality , consider the limit of large lattices .",
    "that is , we replace @xmath183 in eqn .",
    "by @xmath428 for @xmath503 and take @xmath191 to infinity .",
    "then for the position space representation of the ( circulant ) fermionic operator @xmath287 @xmath504 cf . , the discrete fourier transformation turns into a fourier integral @xmath505 where @xmath453 is a continuous momentum and @xmath506 from the solution .      at finite lattices",
    "the fourier transform can be computed in the complexified @xmath453-space .",
    "the fourier integral consists of contributions from poles where the denominator of @xmath508 vanishes and an additional part from the corresponding complex contours that encloses the poles .    because of the regularity of @xmath508 on the real axis , the poles appear away from it . for positive @xmath440",
    "we enclose the poles with positive imaginary parts by adding paths @xmath509 .",
    "the residue at each pole is some number coming from @xmath287 , which we assume to be non - zero , times a term decaying exponentially in @xmath440 from the fourier factor in .",
    "for the same reason there is no contribution from the asymptotic contour at large i m @xmath453 parallel to the real interval @xmath510 $ ] .",
    "the two new contours contribute @xmath511 which turn into laplace transforms @xmath512e^{-\\zeta l a } \\ , .\\ ] ] for large spatial distances @xmath440 only the value of @xmath287 at @xmath454 remains , namely @xmath513\\int_0^{1/la}\\!\\!\\!d\\zeta ( 1-\\zeta l a ) = \\tn(\\pi / a)\\,\\frac{1}{la}\\ ] ] where we used that @xmath287 is odd .",
    "hence the additional contours give _ algebraic corrections to @xmath287 in position space _",
    ", unless @xmath287 vanishes at the boundary of the brillouin zone @xmath454 .",
    "of course the problem of algebraic tails is absent , if @xmath183 is ultra - local . here",
    ", however , we have considered @xmath287 as a function of the slac operator @xmath183 according to the solution .",
    "the way out , which is followed in the body of the paper , section [ sec : locality ] , is to consider general momentum - dependent blocking kernels .",
    "we remark that the discussion is similar for negative @xmath440 ( where one encloses the poles with negative imaginary parts ) .",
    "furthermore , the algebraic corrections do not appear in @xmath286 and @xmath301 , eqn.s , , because these are even functions in @xmath453 .",
    "all of the following one dimensional considerations can be extended easily to higher dimensions .",
    "the considered lattice operators @xmath514 are , because of translational invariance , circulant matrices , @xmath515 the slightly modified condition for locality demands that @xmath266 decays faster than any polynomial .",
    "that means @xmath516 if the fourier transform of @xmath517 , @xmath518 , and its derivatives have no singularities and fulfil periodic boundary conditions at edge of the bz the following estimation can be made @xmath519 consider now a non - local operator similar to the slac derivative .",
    "this non - local operator should have no singularities within the bz for all of its derivatives .",
    "the boundary conditions are , however , not periodic . according to the discussion of the locality of @xmath104 and",
    "@xmath89 it should support the modified locality after a multiplication with a local operator . in view of the above argument the boundary conditions",
    "must hence be enforced by this local operator without spoiling the differentiability of @xmath9 .",
    "its representation in fourier space , @xmath520 , must therefore be a function that vanishes together with all its derivatives at the edge of the bz .",
    "in addition no singularities should appear within the bz for any of its derivatives .",
    "one function that fulfils these requirements is @xmath521 it is clear that @xmath520 can not be analytic since any analytic function that vanishes with all its derivatives at a specific point must be identical to zero .",
    "so the common definition of locality in terms of analyticity in momentum space can not be satisfied .",
