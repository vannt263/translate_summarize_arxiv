    "the advent of large - area photometric and spectroscopic surveys in the recent decade has made observational studies of the galactic stellar populations extremely vibrant .",
    "rapid progress is being made in obtaining independent descriptions of the chemical , kinematic and spatial distributions , especially of the thick disk and halo , although systematic challenges remain associated particularly with the definitions of stellar populations .",
    "photometric definitions , which led to discovery of the thick disk , are reviewed by , for example , @xcite and the history of such studies up to the present is described by @xcite .",
    "much recent focus has been on chemical abundance definitions .",
    "those studies based on either small numbers of high quality spectra or large numbers of lower resolution spectra , have become a major industry .",
    "they have established that the thick disk is a discrete stellar population , at least in the solar neighbourhood ( but _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite for an orthogonal view ) , but raised many open questions and inconsistent results on gradients , origins , and so on ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . as just two more of these very many recent examples , @xcite determined the exponential scale height and scale length of the thick disk from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric data to be 0.9 kpc and 3.6 kpc respectively .",
    "@xcite re - visited the kinematics of the thick disk and halo using sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) and particularly investigated the overlaps between known stellar populations to conclude that the metal weak thick disk is a kinematically and chemically distinct component between the halo and thick disk .",
    "the main challenge for these kinds of studies has been the intrinsic overlap of population distribution functions , and the associated complexities in how to deconvolve them correctly .",
    "improving constraints then requires a moderately high surface density spectroscopic survey , with accurate photometric and proper motion data , sampling a sufficient range of galactic coordinates to support statistical separation of the populations .",
    "much is being learnt , but much remains to be earned , especially from spectroscopy outside the solar neighbourhood ( for example , @xcite )    we present here analysis of a 10,000-star spectroscopic survey , with anglo - australian observatory aaomega spectroscopy complementing sdss photometry , that has the potential for single - population and correlated population - overlap studies of the kinematics , chemistry and spatial distribution of the thick disk .",
    "this survey uses f / g stars to probe significant distances from the sun ; the chemical abundances of these stars provide information on the enrichment history during early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "the radial velocities , along with chemical abundance and spatial distribution , allow us to differentiate between populations .",
    "the main scientific objective of this survey was to determine the unbiased distribution functions over kinematics , metallicity and spatial distributions of the thick disk and halo , with emphasis on the region of overlap between these two populations .",
    "in section 2 of this paper we present the data , discuss the selection function and compare the photometry and spectroscopy to sdss dr7 . in section 3 we present a weighting method for completeness correction , and thereafter explain an isochrone fitting technique used to derive distances to the stars . in this same section , we also provide a brief discussion of the proper motions ( taken from sdss dr7 ) and show that the resulting tangential velocities have inevitable large uncertainties .",
    "we hence show that , for this study , it is better to exclude proper motions from the analysis and model the data with parameters derivable from the spectroscopic measurements i.e. line of sight velocities , metallicities and distances . in section 4",
    "we outline our method to implement such modelling by marginalising over unknown parameters .",
    "we then derive and present our results for the best - fitting kinematic and photometric model of the thick disk , and analyse and characterise the residuals of this model when applied to the data , searching for - and identifying - significant phase - space substructure .     colour - magnitude diagram of data from sdss dr7 covering 32 fields spanning @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and a broad selection function : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the main galactic stellar populations seen in this cmd are - the thin disk near @xmath10 , the thick disk ( brighter ) and halo ( fainter ) near @xmath11 ; [ b ] cmd of ( a ) with the following selection : @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "this significantly reduces thin disk contamination .",

    "the @xmath16 cut mainly eliminates quasars while the @xmath15 and @xmath17 cuts eliminate thin disk and binary stars .",
    "the dot - dashed box again indicates the selected region of thick disk - halo interface stars isolated for study here . ]     and radial velocity from wgn against the values from sdss dr7 , where the dashed line indicates the one - to - one correlation for wgn data .",
    "the bottom panels show the distribution of the difference between the two measurements .",
    "the black histogram denotes the difference between wgn and sdss dr7 , the blue smooth line shows a gaussian fit to this histogram .",
    "the dashed vertical line in each case marks the mean offset of sdss dr7 spectroscopy from wgn , while the dotted vertical lines marks the @xmath18 limits of the scatter .",
    "the value of the mean offset and @xmath18 limits for both [ fe / h ] and radial velocity is indicated in the respective plots . ]",
    "a wide - field spectroscopic survey was carried out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( hereafter wgn ) ) using the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo australian telescope , fed by the 400-fibre 2df facility , targeting lines of sight in the thick disk - halo interface , each covering a two degree field of view .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained for @xmath19 stars , drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric catalogue , along 32 lines of sight in the region @xmath20 i.e. along the celestial equator .",
    "these cover galactic longitudes between @xmath21 and 67@xmath22 at intermediate latitudes ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "table [ table_fields ] provides the coordinates of all the observed lines of sight along with the number of stars analysed in each field .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]             figure [ result1 ] shows the galactocentric velocity distribution for the data and the corresponding distribution produced by the best fit model resulting from our maximum likelihood analysis , where the best fit values were found by scanning through parameter space with a step size of @xmath24= 1,1 km / s . in this plot , the number of stars is normalised to be the same in each field in order to pick out features easily by eye .",
    "the best fit parameters recovered by the maximum likelihood modelling were @xmath25 = 172 , 49 ( km / s ) and @xmath26 = 51 , 40 ( km / s ) .",
    "the rotational velocity is only marginally lower than a canonical thick disk rotation ( @xmath27 km / s , @xcite ) .",
    "the contour plots localising maxima and indicating error bounds and parameter correlations for the various parameters are shown in figure [ contour ] .",
    "these figures show that this simple kinematic model is a good global description of the data , while our best - fit kinematic parameters are in good agreement with earlier determinations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the significance of the difference between model and data ( i.e difference between model and data divided by the poisson error in number counts in each pixel ) is plotted in the bottom - most panel of figure [ result1 ] . a significant mismatch , which we define as several adjacent pixels each of which is more than @xmath28 from the model with the same sign , is evident only near ra @xmath29 .",
    "here many stars seem to have higher line of sight velocities than predicted by the model .",
    "the region of mismatch covers @xmath30 .",
    "it spans low , southern latitudes @xmath31 and lies in the inner galaxy @xmath32 .",
    "it has radial velocities @xmath3320km / s higher than do the typical thick disk stars in these lines of sight .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to this region as r313 .",
    "is the mismatch seen between the global best - fit kinematic model and the data due to substructure in the thick disk , or is it just an artefact of incorrect extinction or systematic errors in distance ?",
    "are the stars with high radial velocity with respect to the thick disk just high contamination from thin disk stars at these low latitudes ?",
    "we analyse the possibilities in this section .",
    "r313 , being at the lower galactic latitude range of the wgn fields that looks into the inner parts of the galaxy , is likely to have a larger contamination of thin disk stars .",
    "the high rotational velocity of the thin disk will show itself with radial velocities higher than that of thick disk by similar amount as seen in this direction . to investigate whether an inadequate model of thin disk stars contributes to the mismatch",
    ", one may consider comparing r313 with the correspondingly low galactic latitude wgn field near ra@xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we found , especially by comparing the metallicity distributions in these two directions , that there is no significant contribution from a thin disk population . by looking at the number of stars in each field as given by the besanon model of the galaxy @xcite on applying the wgn colour - magnitude cuts",
    ", we verify that the number of thin disk stars that pass the selection function is minimal , the contamination being close to 0 in most of the high latitude fields and between 5 and 15% in all the lowest latitude fields , as shown in figure [ besancon_perc ] .",
    "the thin disk kinematic signal , if present , may be unidentifiable towards the galactic centre , near fields ra@xmath36 , but ra@xmath37 being similarly inclined to the centre - anti - centre line as ra@xmath38 , we would expect the thin disk stars to equally show themselves in the line of sight velocity distributions in these fields as well , but this is not the case .",
    "the data match our kinematic model well near ra @xmath39 .",
    "hence we conclude that a misrepresentation of the high - latitude symmetric thin disk can not be the cause of the excess numbers of stars with high line of sight velocities . for similar reasons ,",
    "the fact that we may have ignored any vertical velocity gradient in the kinematic model for the thick disk is an unlikely cause of the mismatch .",
    "might incorrect interstellar extinction be at fault ? if one underestimates the extinction one overestimates the distance , which can make stars in this region appear to be moving faster .",
    "the estimated distance of stars in r313 is on average between 2 to 3 kpc .",
    "however , even a 25% distance error increases the @xmath40 at @xmath41 only by 5 km / s for a rotational velocity of 180 km / s .",
    "therefore , overestimated distances due to incorrect extinction can not produce as significant a shift in @xmath40 as is being observed here .",
    "this would also not explain the excess star counts discussed in the next section .",
    "the above checks confirm that the velocity mismatch seen in region r313 is real and due to some substructure .",
    "we look at _ how many _ stars in the r313 fields contribute to the velocity mismatch . for this , we first assume that the substructure is disk - like with similar @xmath42 and @xmath43 distributions as the thick disk , but a higher mean @xmath44 .",
    "we fix the halo kinematics as before and fix the thick disk kinematics to the values determined from the global fit in section 4.2 .",
    "we isolate four wgn fields that cover region r313 and fit for @xmath0 and @xmath45 of the substructure .",
    "we obtained a maximum likelihood fit of @xmath46 = 206,36 km / s .",
    "as shown in figure [ over_fit ] the substructure has a 35% and 30% contribution to the fields centred on ra 313@xmath47 and 315@xmath47 respectively while the contribution falls sharply to 5% in the fields centred on ra 317@xmath47 and 319@xmath47 .",
    "we should expect these stars to show up as an excess in number count distributions of the thick disk .",
    "we therefore go on to analyse the number of stars per field present in the sdss dr7 data adopting the same colour - magnitude cuts as the wgn selection function , and compare this to the number count predictions given by the besanon model of the galaxy .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure [ numbercounts ] , where significant differences between the model and the data are evident in the ra ranges which correspond to the lowest galactic latitudes ( ra@xmath33133@xmath47 and ra@xmath33313@xmath47 ) .",
    "the default extinction in the besanon model is smaller than in sdss data , so we also show model predictions adopting the sdss dr7 mean extinction in each field , confirming a real difference between model and data .     and same colour cuts as the wgn selection function .",
    "black : sdss dr7 data ; orange : besanon model values ; green : besanon model number counts corrected with the corresponding extinction for each field from sdss dr7 .",
    "sdss data shows an excess of stars in comparison to the besanon model in two regions - ra less than 140@xmath47 and ra in the range 313@xmath47 to 330@xmath47 , which figure [ trend ] shows is the region sensitive to thick disk structural parameters . ]     and scale length @xmath48 for the thick disk and a flattened power - law with flattening @xmath49 and index @xmath50 for the halo .",

    "the data are mostly sensitive to the thick disk radial scale length and a sufficient range of fields has been targeted to provide useful constraints on those structural parameters .",
    "this analysis thus illustrates the utility of the range of fields selected for observation by wgn as a test of thick disk structural parameters .",
    "we define two figures of merit , ratio1 , being the ratio of the number of stars per square degree selected by the wgn criteria in the field at ra=313@xmath47 to the corresponding number for the field at ra=249@xmath47 ; and ratio2 , the corresponding number comparing the star counts in the field at ra=133@xmath47 to those in the field at ra=249@xmath47 .",
    "these figures of merit quantify how the change in the thick disk structural parameters @xmath53 affect the shape of the star counts distribution as a function line of sight .",
    "the star count distributions produced by the besanon model has ratio1=0.66 and ratio2=0.20 while the observed distribution from sdss data has ratio1=1.69 and ratio2=0.37 .",
    "this quantifies the discrepancy between data and model evident in figure [ numbercounts ] .    by experiment",
    "we see that @xmath54 2.1,1.0 kpc reproduces the besanon number distribution well ( shown in bottom panel of figure [ trend ] ) .",
    "that is , the besanon model description of the thick disk , for the observational parameters of relevance here , may be described as a double exponential with @xmath54 2.1,1.0 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with values quoted in @xcite as used in the model for the thick disk density profile which is a modified exponential having scale length of 2.5@xmath550.5 kpc , and scale height of 0.8@xmath550.5 kpc . as shown in figure [ numbercounts",
    "] , however , that model substantially and systematically under - predicts the observed sdss star counts . increasing the radial thick disk scale length to the value",
    "@xmath56 4.1 kpc , as shown in figure [ trial ] , makes the shape of the number distribution consistent with sdss data.this number is in agreement with the value obtained by @xcite who analyse m dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood ( at distances less than 2 kpc ) from sdss data to estimate a scale length of 3.6 kpc for the thick disk . while most previous works which estimate the scale length using star count analysis obtain scale length values between 3.5 and 4.5 kpc which is consistent with our analysis here , those works which have employed population separation based on a kinematic or chemical selection , such as @xcite and @xcite , estimate a much lower scale length of around 2kpc .",
    "understanding this difference will no doubt significantly improve definition of the astrophysical nature of the thick disk .    while an increased @xmath48 reproduces the observed value of ratio2",
    ", there is still a large disagreement in ratio1 ( compare black line ( data ) and blue line ( model ) in figure [ trial ] ) .",
    "subtracting from the data the contribution of the high velocity substructure determined from figure [ over_fit ] ( red line ) , we see that the match improves for ratio1 too .",
    "thus , from this simple toy - model analysis we deduce a value of @xmath33 4.0 kpc for the thick disk scale length .",
    "we find that a smooth double - exponential is , however , not a complete description of the data and a substantial overdensity , compared to this model , is apparent in the star counts , localised near ra@xmath33313@xmath47 .",
    "this overdensity matches the fraction of stars contributed by the high - velocity sub - structure identified in the previous section .",
    "in the next section , we analyse and characterise the stars in this sub - structure .     the star count data ( black ) and the simple model ( blue ) are in tolerable agreement .",

    "figure [ over_cmd ] shows the colour - magnitude diagram of these two fields in the region r313 where the contribution of the high velocity stars is most significant .",
    "we see that both the wgn and sdss dr7 cmd look thick disk - like with the high - velocity stars overlapping with thick disk stars .",
    "no special feature in the cmd or extra turn - off is apparent .",

    "is rejected at the 5 percent level based on the kolmogorov smirnov test .",
    "the same comparison was done for ra@xmath33133 and the null hypothesis was accepted .",

    "we looked at the @xmath64 distribution of stars from this line of sight by cross matching the wgn data with proper motions from stripe 82 based on position , being aware from our analysis above ( figure [ erroranal ] ) that such comparisons are indicative rather than conclusive .",
    "we used new high - precision values of sdss star proper motions re - calibrated by @xcite using background galaxies .",
    "613 matches were obtained .",
    "stars with proper motion errors greater than 30mas / yr were removed .",

    "the @xmath44 and @xmath43 distributions of the two sets of fields are indistinguishable .",
    "this is consistent with the excess stars being in thick disk - like orbits . whereas , the mean @xmath42 of the fields in r313 is offset towards positive values .",
    "an independent source of kinematics in the region of interest comes from other sdss studies , the sdss spectra themselves . the sdss dr7 spectra , selected applying the wgn selection function , hint at a cold high velocity structure which is spatially and kinematically consistent with r313 .",
    "figure [ over_dr7 ] shows line of sight velocities from sdss dr7 for a region @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "each panel is a 4@xmath47 block in ra , the mid value of ra being shown at the top of each panel .",
    "the colours represent low to high density from red to blue while the dashed line shows the position of thick disk rotation ( i.e @xmath44=172 km / s ) at a distance of 2 kpc for each direction and serves as a reference .",
    "if velocities are consistent with being thick disk , we would expect the peak in density in each bin of declination to coincide with the dashed line .",
    "we can see that this is the case in most bins , apart from an excess of stars at relatively high v@xmath69 velocities ( immediately to the right of the dashed line ) in the first two panels at dec@xmath33 0@xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with the high velocity stars seen in the wgn data . for clarity ,",
    "recall that these stars have observed radial velocity v@xmath70 near zero ( cf fig [ vrvsra ] ) .",
    "any selection effects in sdss spectroscopy are unlikely to vary enough from field to field , within the tight cuts of the wgn selection function , to change this result .",
    "the overdensity observed by us is in a direction of the sky that is extremely busy , with previously identified sub - structures such as the hercules thick disk overdensity at 1 - 2 kpc , hercules aquila cloud at 10 - 20kpc and more recent sub - structure observed in rr lyrae stars in stripe 82 at 10 - 25kpc .",
    "the hercules thick disk overdensity , first identified and studied in detail by @xcite , and further investigated in subsequent papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) thereafter , is an excess of faint blue stars in the region @xmath71 and @xmath72 , thus overlapping with r313 .",
    "these stars were estimated to have distances between 1 - 2 kpc from the sun , consistent with distances estimated by our method for our stars .",
    "@xcite additionally also provide velocity measurements for their fields .",
    "they found that stars in quadrant i ( where the excess stars were found ) had a @xmath73 of -28.6 @xmath55 1.6 km / s above the plane and a @xmath73 of -35.6 @xmath55 2.0 km / s below the plane .",
    "they also state that going beyond 4 kpc along the line of sight , where the overdensity coincides with the density contours of the galactic bar , the rotational rates become larger than standard thick disk rotation .",
    "these kinematic parameters are in agreement with those we find here , though our sample here is very much more spatially concentrated than is that of @xcite .    the hercules aquila cloud @xcite is thought to be a large structure further out in this same direction , centred on @xmath74 and extending both above and below the plane up to @xmath75 . the cloud was estimated to be more metal rich than -2.2 dex and have distances in the range of 10 - 20kpc .",
    "their paper quotes a corresponding kinematic signature of @xmath76km / s associated with this cloud which matches the kinematic signal we find in the wgn data .",
    "we also looked at the density of rr lyrae stars in stripe 82 @xcite , and towards the hercules - aquila density enhancement . in figure 11 of @xcite",
    ", the overdensity marked b is centred on similar directions as our overdensity , but extends between 5 and 25kpc .",
    "cross - matching these stars with sloan spectroscopy resulted in a handful of matches . while these stars showed a peak in [ fe / h ] near -1.5dex , we did not find a coherent velocity for stars in this structure .",
    "given there are at least two known overdensities in this direction at distances beyond 10kpc , we investigated the possibility of the stars in our overdensity in fact being at distances beyond 10kpc , but being assigned grossly underestimated distances by our by our analysis techniques .",
    "looking at the predictions from the besanon model , we find that few sub - giants at large distances ( further than 10kpc ) pass through the wgn selection function and such stars fall in the very red , faint end of the wgn selection box .",
    "our distance determination will indeed grossly underestimate the distances to these stars , putting them at 2 - 4 kpc . but this would require that all of the stars in the overdensity be clearly concentrated in colour - magnitude space at the faint - red end . as seen from figure [ over_cmd ] this is not the case .",
    "the overdensity stars instead look very thick - disk like .",
    "we analyse the wgn medium resolution aaomega spectroscopic survey of some 10,000 stars , selected using sdss photometry to be main sequence turn - off stars in the thick disk - halo interface .",
    "the goal has been to investigate large - scale and small - scale kinematic , chemical and spatial properties of these two old stellar populations , and additionally also investigate the region of transition / overlap between these two populations .",
    "preparatory to the analysis , we developed a weighting method in colour - magnitude space for completeness correction . applying this correction",
    ", we obtained a completeness - corrected representation of the parent stellar population selected by the wgn selection function , thus preparing the data for analysis .",
    "robust distance estimates were obtained by isochrone fitting , using either or both of sdss @xmath77 and ukidss jhk photometry , for the stars , providing distances with a systematic uncertainty of less than 10% .",
    "we demonstrated how it is convenient to model the data in observable space directly .",
    "propagated errors in derived parameters , especially those in @xmath78 due to proper motions , can be dominant , and hence deconvolution can degrade the most accurate data , here radial velocities and [ fe / h ] values , from any analysis .",
    "hence , we analysed the kinematics of the thick disk using only observable line of sight velocities , adopting the technique from @xcite and limiting the use of derived parameters to that of distance alone . in this study",
    ", we obtain a global description of the thick disk kinematics to demonstrate the scope of the data and the efficiency of the technique .",
    "the best fit thick disk kinematic parameters are determined to be @xmath0=172 km / s and @xmath1 = ( 49,51,40 ) km / s which agrees reasonably well with values from previous studies .    by comparing this global model description with the data ,",
    "we identify a region near ra@xmath33313@xmath22 which has higher line of sight v@xmath69 velocities than expected for the thick disk in this region .",
    "the same region is found also to have a local overdensity of stars in comparison to that expected for thick disk density models .",
    "the stars in the overdensity have a turn - off cmd similar to that of the thick disk and metallicities @xmath2  dex , similar to , but slightly more metal poor than , the thick disk @xcite .",
    "the stars in the excess are thus as old as are those of the thick disk .",
    "the overdensity decreases rapidly over a 4@xmath47 increase in ra from 312@xmath47 .",
    "its further extent is poorly determined as yet .",
    "this overdensity spatially may be associated in some way with the hercules thick disk overdensity .",
    "line of sight velocity measurements from @xcite match with the overdensity found in our wgn data , but they infer lower rotational velocities than thick disk for the stars in the overdensity while given our distance range we infer the opposite . we should have also expected the velocity signature to continue till at least ra of 320@xmath47 if associated with the hercules thick disk overdensity which is a large structure .",
    "this line of sight is towards the hercules - aquila halo cloud and a small spatial - scale overdensity in the rr lyrae distribution .",
    "obtaining reliable velocity estimates for these structures would be illuminating .",
    "we have shown that the method of modelling in observable space is very powerful not only to obtain a global description of the galactic stellar populations , but also to identify and pick out substructure .",
    "we will extend this method in future work , to include scientifically important questions of spatial gradients in structure , kinematics and metallicity in the thick disk .",
