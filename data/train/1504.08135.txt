    "in many cases , an electromagnetic field shows near - field or far - field behavior when it is observed in a region near or far from the field source .",
    "the division of the near field and far field is not only helpful for simplifying theoretical calculation in different regions , but also easy to highlight the features of the field in respect regions so as to provide physical interpretations of the field behaviors .",
    "an important question of how to distinguish the near and far fields naturally arose .",
    "usually , the field can be expanded by negative powers of the distance between the field point and source @xcite .",
    "the far field is dominated by the lowest order term , and the near field by the higher - order terms .",
    "the former arises from the requirement of energy conservation and is call a `` far field approximation '' or `` leading - order approximation ( loa ) '' .    for dipole radiations in a vacuum background , the near - filed / far - field ( nfff )",
    "boundary is of the order of light wavelength @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "as the source becomes larger , this dimension should be corrected as @xmath2 by the diffraction theory , where @xmath3 represents slit widths or antenna lengths .",
    "however , what we frequently encounter in practical situations are stratified backgrounds , rather than the vacuum one .",
    "stratified backgrounds are of complex configurations , in which the nfff boundary has not been properly addressed yet .",
    "to reveal the nfff boundary in such backgrounds is not only a complement in theory , but also very important for many practical applications , such as remote sensing , antenna design , nfff transformation and so on @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "the distances between sources and observation points are usually much larger than operating wavelengths , so that the sources can be treated as dipoles . here",
    "we investigate the far - field asymptotic behaviors of dipole radiations in stratified structures , and address a universal nfff boundary .",
    "calculation of the dipole radiations in stratified structures is mathematically equivalent to dealing with sommerfeld integrals ( sis ) . in general , numerical evaluations of the sis",
    "are not easy since the integrals have an oscillatory feature and possess singularities along or near the integration paths .",
    "several numerical methods have been proposed to calculate the sis so far .",
    "et al_. @xcite developed a direct numerical integration method by appropriately choosing the integration path that avoided all possible singularities in the complex plane .",
    "this method has been considered as a standard test for the accuracies of other methods .",
    "the discrete complex image method @xcite and the rational function fitting method @xcite tried to expand the integrands by simple functions to obtain closed - form solutions . on the other hand , under the far - field approximation , closed - form expressions could be obtained from sis by asymptotic methods @xcite or reciprocal theorem @xcite .",
    "compared with the numerical ones , the asymptotic methods are of advantages of simplicity , easy programming , and clear physical interpretations .    the stationary phase method and",
    "the steepest descent method are two commonly used asymptotic methods @xcite .",
    "both of them approximate the value of a rapid - oscillating integral by the contributions around stationary points ( sps ) or saddle points , and provide the same loa results for the sis @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a simplified version @xcite of the stationary phase method to perform the asymptotic analysis .",
    "this simplified version has been successfully applied in the research of underwater communication @xcite , antenna design @xcite , and nfff transformation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the loa can acquired precise results from sis when the observation point moves to infinity @xcite .",
    "but for practical usage , an empirical distance is needed to justify its applicability , which is the nfff boundary .",
    "although an error analysis by estimation of higher - order contributions may reveal the boundary , the analysis becomes very difficult in stratified structures .",
    "here we compare the asymptotic results with the accurate numerical ones in different stratified structures . in this way a universal empirical boundary is obtained .",
    "it is found that the nfff boundary is mainly affected by lateral waves , which correspond to the branch point contributions in sis @xcite . besides",
    ", the boundary is sensitive to the structure configurations and the location of the dipole .",
    "moreover , two kinds of treatments in the asymptotic method are carried out and their numerical results are compared .",
    "the equivalence between the field expressions obtained from the asymptotic method and reciprocal theorem is also demonstrated .",
    "the paper is arranged as follow : section 2 sets our model of the stratified structures and presents the loa formalism .",
    "section 3 and 4 discuss the far - field distributions and the nfff boundary in bilayer and trilayer structures , respectively .",
    "then the results are generalized to multilayer structures and proved to be universally applicable in sec .",
    "5 . finally ,",
    "presents our concluding remarks .",
    "the model studied in this paper consists of a lossless layered structure with the stratification along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "it contains @xmath5 layers and @xmath6 interfaces from top to bottom , as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . since we concentrate on the far field , the two semispaces , i. e. , the top and bottom layers , are focused on and the intermediate regions are ignored when their details are not needed .",
    "the lower surface of the top layer is at @xmath7 and the upper surface of the bottom layer is at @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "a vertical electric dipole ( ved ) is located on the origin inside the structure . for convenience ,",
    "we consider the @xmath4 component of the electric fields @xmath9 generated by the ved .",
    "other field components and other dipole orientations will be discussed in sec .",

    ", @xmath74 corresponds to the @xmath75 branch point , and at this point the integration gives a lateral wave @xcite .",

    "3 , the boundary may be chosen as @xmath86 , which satisfies the evaluation of the order of magnitude indicated by fig .",

    "one is that for a very small @xmath87 , e. g. , @xmath88 , @xmath1 may not eliminate the influence of the lateral waves ( numerically verified ) , which means that a lower boundary should be better . considering fig .",
    "3(d ) , the boundary may be written as @xmath89max@xmath90 , where max@xmath91 means `` choose the larger one '' .",

    "although the two @xmath87 values in fig .",
    "3 differ by 100 times , the nfff boundary only depends on @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , as implied by eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 6a ) and ( 6b ) , the field distribution has a scale invariance over @xmath0 in a non - dispersive media , indicating that the field behaviors shown in fig",

    "while the last one is commonly referred as leaky modes which violates the radiation condition and only shows up in a certain range of angle in space @xcite .",
    "the guided modes occur in the middle layer of a mode guiding configuration where the middle layer possesses the largest ri .",
    "the proper complex modes can not propagate far from the source due to their decaying nature .",
    "therefore , these two kinds of modes will not be touched in the following discussions .",
    "the leaky modes affect the far - field distribution and will be considered . secondly , because there are two interfaces in this structure , light multi - reflects in the middle layer and may cause more oscillations in the far - field distribution .",
    "we will not explain all the formations of these oscillations , but focus on the ones that may affect the nfff boundary .",
    "moreover , the differences between method a and b are not obvious in the previous section because @xmath44 are small , but will be magnified by the multi - reflection in the middle layer .",

    "is mainly determined by the lateral waves and satisfies eq .",

    "light multi - reflects in each layer in the intermediate region .",
    "consequently , the expressions of the field will have a recursive fashion , which will make the ray interpretations very complicated and limit the applicability of method a. however , method b is still of the simplicity in mathematics and is suitable for multilayered structures .    the nfff boundary in the multilayered structures is mainly affected by the lateral waves as well .",
    "the attenuation behaviors of these waves are similar to the ones shown in fig .",
    "4 , so that eq . ( 9 ) is correct in the order of magnitude .",
    "the value of the dimensional parameter @xmath3 depends on whether the ved is in the top layer or in the intermediated region .",
    "when the ved is in the top layer , @xmath3 equals the distance between the ved and the lowest interface at @xmath8 ; when the ved is in one of the intermediate layer , @xmath3 is the distance between the highest interface at @xmath7 and lowest interface at @xmath8 , which is the total thickness of the intermediate region .",
    "the multi - reflection processes do not affect the @xmath3 value for the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , the multi - reflections have a quick convergence .",
    "all the results of method a shown in the figures converge when @xmath106 is up to @xmath149 , which does not change the order of @xmath3 . secondly , as can be seen from fig .",
    "4 , the lateral waves have a nearly @xmath85 decay when @xmath3 is small , and have a more rapid decay when @xmath3 is relatively larger . therefore the influence from the multi - reflection",
    "may decay to a negligible one within the distance given by eq .",
    "moreover , it is this decay characteristic of the lateral waves that makes the nfff boundary almost independent of the wavelength .    for other field components of the dipole radiations and the cases of different dipole orientations ,",
    "we have numerically verified the correctness of eq .",
    "( 9 ) . besides , all these cases depend on the evaluations of the scattering coefficients related sis , but the field expressions are slightly different , which results in different far - field patterns over the observation angles",
    ". however , in the asymptotic analysis , they have the same sps and similar asymptotic expressions and branch cut contributions .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( 9 ) is applicable .    in the beginning of sec .",
    "2 , we have assumed that all of the layers were lossless .",
    "now let us discuss what about the case where the intermediate region is not lossless .",
    "in such a situation , two cases are distinguished to discuss the nfff boundary : the loss is large or small .",
    "when the loss is large , as in undersea communications where short waves may not reach the sea bottom @xcite , the air - ocean - earth trilayer model simplifies to an air - ocean bilayer one . from the discussions in sec .",
    "3 , a distance of @xmath67 is enough to differentiate the near field and far field in air .",
    "when the loss is relatively small , the amplitude of light decreases as it arrives the bottom interface , which accordingly leads to a decrease of the differences between the asymptotic results and the accurate ones . generally speaking",
    ", losses make the nfff boundary reduced : its value will be less than that given by eq .",
    "our conclusion can extend to bulk sources .",
    "on the one hand , within the scope of volume integral method @xcite , a bulk source can be considered as a superposition of dipoles .",
    "the far - field radiations of each dipole have been fully discussed above . on the other hand , within the scope of nfff transformation @xcite , the near fields of an arbitrary source can be converted to equivalence surface dipoles on a virtual closed surface .",
    "therefore the dimensional parameter @xmath3 should anchor to the brightest spots in the near field .",
    "of course , our conclusions can be considered as an applicable scope of the nfff transformation .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the far - field asymptotic behaviors of dipole radiations in stratified backgrounds and obtain a universal empirical expression of nfff boundary , eq .",
    "the asymptotic results are compared with the accurate numerical ones in various configurations to make sure the universality of eq .",
    "the nfff boundary is mainly affected by the lateral waves , which correspond to branch point contributions in the sis and are of a higher - order attenuation . in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the parameter @xmath3 plays a key role , and it is much larger than the operating wavelength . as a result ,",
    "the nfff boundary in a stratified background is totally different from that in vacuum . to be more specific , eq .",
    "( 9 ) describes the boundary between the intermediate and far fields .",
    "however , since the intermediate field is vaguely defined in optics , we still call it as the nfff boundary . in the case",
    "that the observation point is in a region where its ri is the lowest in the whole structure ( usually air ) , the lateral wave decay rapidly , and the nfff boundary is about ten wavelengths .",
    "it is believed that our conclusions are very helpful in understanding and applying the far - field approximation . in electromagnetic simulations , such as the finite - difference time - domain method and the finite element method ,",
    "the far - field results are obtained by a nfff transformation where the far field approximation , or the loa , is employed .",
