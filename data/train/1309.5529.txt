    "different assignments of particles to the lines change only an su(3 ) factor and the involved masses , but otherwise the result of the feynman diagram stays the same . for diagrams with exchanged ( crossed ) final state baryons ( e.g. yn interaction diagrams with strangeness exchange ) one has additionally to apply the spin exchange operator , and has to exchange the momenta of the final state baryons .    .",
