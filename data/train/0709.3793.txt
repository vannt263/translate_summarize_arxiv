    "there has been considerable debate recently on the issue of `` pseudobulges '' : cases where the central `` bulge '' of a disk galaxy is apparently _ not _ a small elliptical galaxy embedded within the disk ( the `` classical '' model of a bulge ) but instead something more disklike and  it is thought  the result of internal , secular evolution processes instead of violent early mergers ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the review by kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) ) .",
    "the tendency has been to contrast pseudobulges and classical bulges as in some sense exclusive categories : galaxies have either a classical bulge ( e.g. , early - type disks ) or a pseudobulge ( e.g. , late - type disks ) , but not both at once ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see athanassoula 2005 ) ) . here",
    ", i present photometric and kinematic evidence suggesting that some galaxies _ can _ have both at once .",
    "the term `` pseudobulge '' has become overly general and confused , with different authors using the term to describe different stellar structures , and using different criteria to identify them . in this study ,",
    "i recognize and am concerned with three entities :    * * photometric bulge : * this is the region of a galaxy defined by a bulge - disk decomposition , where excess light in the inner regions of a galaxy dominates over the light of the outer exponential disk . * * classical bulge : * this is the traditional idea of a `` bulge '' : a spheroidal or weakly triaxial collection of stars dominated by random motions ( velocity dispersion ) .",
    "it can be recognized by being significantly rounder ( in projection ) than the disk , and by being kinematically hot . * * ( disky ) pseudobulge : * this is an inner disk of stars , with a geometry ( flattening ) similar to that of the outer disk .",
    "a `` kinematic '' pseudobulge is one with evidence for rotationally dominated stellar kinematics ( i.e. , more like disk kinematics ) .",
    "secondary characteristics can include nuclear bars , spirals , rings , etc . , but these are not required .",
    "note that i do not consider `` boxy / peanut - shaped bulges , '' which are well understood as the vertically thickened inner part of bars .",
    "i also do not touch on issues of stellar colors , star formation , or dust ; s0 galaxies have been shown to harbor disky pseudobulges even though they are generally free of dust and recent star formation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* erwin , vega beltrn , graham , 2003 ) ) .",
    "finally , i do not assume that particular surface - brightness profiles ( as indicated by , e.g. , srsic indices ) necessarily belong to one category or another , although in practice disky pseudobulges often have quasi - exponential profiles .",
    "the basic approach is to first identify the photometric bulge of a galaxy via a bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "the morphology , structure , and geometry of the photometric bulge is then examined , to see if it is predominately disklike or spheroidal .",
    "finally , the stellar kinematics of the photometric bulge are used to determine if the stellar motions are dominated by velocity dispersion ( as for a classical bulge ) or by rotation .",
    "kinematically , photometric bulges can be judged by placing them on the well - known @xmath0 diagram .",
    "empirically , almost all ellipticals  and a number of unambiguously classical bulges in edge - on spirals  fall on or below the line traced by an idealized isotropic oblate rotator model ( ior ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* binney 1978 ) ) .",
    "following @xcite , i identify photometric bulges which fall _ above _ the ior curve as kinematic pseudobulges : they are dominated by rotation to a degree not seen in ellipticals and bona fide classical bulges .",
    "-band isophotes of ngc 4371 , with major - axis cut line .",
    "lower left : major - axis surface - brightness profile , with srsic + exponential fit .",
    "the srsic - dominated region ( the `` photometric bulge '' ) is @xmath1 ; the vertical dashed green line marks the boundary .",
    "upper middle : zoom of the photometric bulge region , showing elliptical isophotes and rounder isophotes inside .",
    "lower middle : surface - brightness profile of the photometric bulge region , fit with srsic + exponential + ring ; an `` inner photometric bulge '' dominates the light at @xmath2 ( light gray shading ) .",
    "upper right : ellipse fits to ground - based and hst isophotes .",
    "lower right : major - axis stellar kinematics .",
    "the stellar velocity has a clear maximum in the photometric bulge region ( @xmath3 ) , and a plateau in the _ inner _ photometric bulge ( @xmath4 ) . ]",
    "all of this follows in the path pioneered by @xcite . what is new is the idea of a recursive approach once a disky pseudobulge has been identified . by using high - resolution imaging ( e.g. , from hst ) and spectroscopy , we can focus on the inner region of the pseudobulge and  in some cases , at least ",
    "identify a separate `` inner photometric bulge '' which has rounder isophotes and hotter kinematics .",
    "ngc  4371 is a barred s0 galaxy in the virgo cluster , notable for a bright stellar nuclear ring inside its bar ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* erwin & sparke 1999 ) ) . in the left - hand panels of figure  [ fig : n4371 ] ,",
    "i show a major - axis surface - brightness profile , along with a simple bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "this decomposition defines the photometric bulge as the region at @xmath5 .",
    "inspection of the isophotes ( upper middle and upper right panels of figure  [ fig : n4371 ] ) shows that this region is precisely where the stellar nuclear ring is found .",
    "the ellipticity reaches a peak of @xmath6 at @xmath7 ; this is close to the ellipticity of the _ outer _ disk ( 0.45 ) .",
    "the stellar kinematics ( figure  [ fig : n4371 ] , lower right ) show a clear velocity maximum at roughly the same radius as the nuclear ring .",
    "the ratio of this velocity to the mean velocity dispersion is @xmath8 , well above the ior curve given its apparent ellipticity ( predicted @xmath9 ; figure  [ fig : vsigma ] ) .",
    "since the photometric bulge is both highly flattened ( like a disk ) and dominated by rotation ( kinematically similar to a disk ) , it qualifies as a pseudobulge .",
    "( this was originally pointed out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kormendy 1982 ) . )",
    "however , close inspection of the pseudobulge using hst images shows that at small radii ( @xmath10 ) , the isophotes becomes distinctly _ rounder _ , with @xmath11 .",
    "( the minimum in ellipticity just outside this zone is consistent with the isophotal effects of an elliptical ring superimposed on a rounder bulge ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* erwin 2001 ) ) .",
    "a bulge / disk decomposition of the photometric bulge profile shows that it is well fit by an exponential + an inner srsic component ( along with an asymmetric gaussian to account for the ring ; lower middle panel of figure  [ fig : n4371 ] ) .",
    "the resulting `` inner '' photometric bulge turns out to be precisely that region ( @xmath10 ) where the isophotes become rounder .",
    "so it appears that while the outer part of the pseudobulge is highly flattened and nearly exponential in profile , the interior harbors an additional , rounder component .",
    "the kinematics in _ this _ region ( lower right panel , figure  [ fig : n4371 ] ) have @xmath0 almost identical to the @xmath0 predicted for @xmath12 .",
    "the innermost component thus appears to be a classical bulge : rounder than the pseudobulge ( and the outer disk ) and _ not _ dominated by rotation .     diagram .",
    "crosses are elliptical galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* davies  1983 ) ) , open circles are large , edge - on bulges ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* kormendy & illingworth 1982 ; jarvis & freeman 1985 ) ) , and stars are de galaxy ngc 205 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "filled black squares are photometric bulges of barred s0 galaxies ( erwin  2008 ) ; circled / filled blue squares are disky pseudobulges with inner classical bulges ( open blue squares ) , with dashed lines connecting classical bulges and disky pseudobulges of the same galaxy . ]",
    "preliminary analyses have been done for five more galaxies ( four s0 and one sab ) which show similar composite structures and kinematics ; these are indicated by blue symbols in figure  [ fig : vsigma ] .",
    "note that since these galaxies have bars , they most likely also have the box / peanut structures of bars ; these galaxies probably have all three of the distinct components suggested by @xcite . comparison with an ongoing study of pseudobulges in barred s0 galaxies ( ( * ? ?",
    "* erwin , aguerri , beckman ,  2008 ) ) suggests that at least one quarter of s0 pseudobulges may be composite systems .",
    "two of these composite systems ( ngc  2787 and ngc  3384 ) are known supermassive black hole hosts , which suggests a possible resolution to an issue first raised by @xcite .",
    "black hole masses correlate well with properties of host elliptical galaxies , and also with properties of host ( photometric ) bulges in disk galaxies , which suggests common evolutionary mechanisms .",
    "however , black holes are apparently also found in galaxies with pseudobulges , which are thought to have formation mechanisms different from those of ellipticals and classical bulges . if pseudobulge galaxies with black holes _ also _ have classical bulges , then the idea of a common evolutionary mechanism driving black hole and ( classical ) bulge growth",
    "may still be tenable ."
