    "deep radio observations provide a powerful opportunity to investigate the high redshift universe .",
    "moreover , since radio observations are almost unaffected by dust extinction , they allow us to observe objects , which are heavily obscured in other bands . while bright radio sources are mostly powerful radio galaxies and radio - loud ( rl ) active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , at lower flux densities we observe an increasing fraction of star - forming galaxies ( sfg ) and radio - quiet ( rq ) agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "source classification of deep radio surveys is not easy and requires multi - frequency data .",
    "this approach was adopted in a series of papers , which studied a radio selected sample of 266 objects in the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ; * ? ? ?",

    "these authors were able first to classify the sources as sfg , rq agn and rl agn and then to study the properties and the evolution of the different classes separately . the promising results of this work have encouraged us to apply it to a new radio catalog ( n. miller et al .",

    ", we have three times more objects , with most of the new sources in the sub - mjy regime ( at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the identification of the optical and ir counterparts of the radio sources .",
    "our main goal is to assign a redshift to the radio sources and to associate them with the correct photometry .",
    "this information will be then used in future papers to classify the sources and study their evolutionary properties . as mentioned above",
    ", a faint radio selected sample includes sources of widely different nature : sfg with a blue stellar population together with radio galaxies commonly hosted in redder objects , and obscured agn together with bright unobscured quasars .",
    "for this reason , it is important to consider a large wavelength range , from the ultraviolet to the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "faint radio sources often correspond to faint optical counterparts .",
    "therefore , deep optical observations are needed .",
    "this has an impact on the methodology that should be adopted in the identification process .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec - data ] we present the datasets , while in section [ sec - count_ident - result ] we describe the likelihood ratio method we used to identify the counterparts of our sources and the results of the identification process , including an estimate of the spurious association fraction and a comparison with the cross - correlation method .",

    "the most likely counterpart has a reliability under our threshold and was therefore rejected .",

    ", we estimate the rate of spurious associations by randomly shifting the position of the radio sources and computing again the reliability for all the possible counterparts .",
    "we apply only shifts between 5 and 15 arcsec in order not to exceed the field coverage .",

    "the same reliability threshold of 0.6 is adopted . the average fraction of false association over 50 different shifts is reported in table [ tab - stat_each_cat ] for each auxiliary catalog .",
    "we find spurious fractions from 3% up to 5% for the deep optical catalogs . in the case of h",

    "we estimate the fraction of spurious associations similar to what has been done for the likelihood method , namely shifting the radio catalog with respect to the auxiliary one .",
    "we used the same set of displacements as in the previous case .",
    "as shown in table [ tab - stat_each_cat ] , our likelihood ratio technique is generally less affected by spurious contamination especially when applied to the deep optical catalogs .",
    "in particular , in the cases of the u - vimos and v - gems catalogs the spurious fraction exceeds 10% with the cross - correlation method . if we decrease the searching radius from 0.7 to 0.5 arcsec for all the optical catalogs , the fraction of false counterparts becomes lower ( 8% , 7% , 3% , for the u - vimos , v - gems and r - wfi catalogs , respectively ) , but we also miss a significant fraction of real identification ( 19% , 23% and 14% , respectively ) . for nir and mir catalogs ,",
    "the two methods are almost equivalent .",
    "we obtain slightly higher fractions of fake associations with the likelihood ratio technique but with the cross - correlation method we miss a larger number of counterparts .",
    "this is mainly due to the lower source surface density with respect to the optical catalogs .",
    "we note that the shift - and - rematch method tends to overestimate the number of false matches as it ignores the fact that there are a large fraction of the sources that do have counterparts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details . ) .",
    "our estimates should therefore be considered as upper limits .",
    "since this effect is the same both for the likelihood and the cross - correlation method , it does not affect our conclusions .",
    "finally , we assume that the fraction of spurious association in the final catalog is equal to the weighted average of the spurious fraction of each catalog , using the number of counterparts selected from each catalog as weight .",
    "we then expect at most 4% spurious counterparts .",
    "the brighter sources of the present catalog were already included in the radio catalog described in @xcite .",
    "we have compared the counterparts found in @xcite ( m08 , hereafter ) with those selected in this work for the sources in common .",
    "we find that in 90% of the cases",
    "the same counterpart is selected . for the remaining 10%",
    ", we select a different counterpart compared to m08 . in most cases",
    "the counterparts were identified in the optical band by m08 while we find a more convincing counterpart in newly acquired mir observations . for eight out of twelve objects that were unidentified or under the threshold in m08 , we now have a reliable counterpart .",
    "one example is rid 625 ( i d in the @xcite catalog kid=202 ) that was in an empty field in m08 while we identify it at 24 @xmath5 m . the criteria to identify the best counterpart candidate of a radio source are slightly different between the two works . in m08 a likelihood ratio threshold of 0.2",
    "was adopted , while we use a cut in reliability to take into account the presence of multiple counterpart candidates of the same radio source .",
    "our reliability threshold of 0.6 is a bit more conservative ( it correspond to a @xmath16 threshold of @xmath46 ) and it is aimed at reducing the number of spurious identifications .",
    "another difference between the two works is that in m08 the best counterpart was chosen according to an a priori ranking of the auxiliary catalogs .",
    "the priority was set according to the depth of the optical / nir survey and to the wavelength . given the larger number of auxiliary catalogs used in this work we use a different approach : between catalogs in the same wavelength range ( optical , nir and mir )",
    ", we select the counterpart with the highest reliability ( see section [ sec - ident ] ) .",
    "this allows us to fully exploit the information given by the probability distributions obtained with the likelihood ratio technique .",
    "moreover , we minimize the number of tentative associations selected in a high priority optical / nir catalog yet with a reliability just above the threshold . as a consequence , with our new approach 90% of the counterparts",
    "have a reliability greater than 0.96 , in contrast to 0.83 obtained in m08 ( see fig . 4 in m08 ) .",
    "moreover , we observe a significant decrease in the average separation between the radio source and its counterpart compared to m08 . in this work , we find 90% of the counterparts within 0.7 arcsec around the radio position , which is about half of the radius found in m08 ( see fig .",
    "[ dist_comul ] ) .",
    "this is partially due to the change in resolution of the two radio surveys ( from 3.5@xmath47 in @xcite to 2.8@xmath48 in this work ) .        in summary , using the new mir imaging in the e - cdfs area , we reach the same fraction of identification ( 95% ) as in m08 , although we adopt a higher reliability threshold and a larger fraction of the radio sources is in the outer part of the field , where the multi - wavelength coverage is poorer .",

    "whose radio morphology suggested a complex radio structure ( e.g. , kid 114 ) have been identified as independent sources .",
    "the opposite case is represented by source rid 73 . here",
    ", we conclude that the radio emission is associated with a single compact radio - lobe source with a single optical counterpart .",
    "comparison between likelihood ratio and cross - correlation methods_. in sec [ sec - surious ] , we compare the likelihood ratio technique with the positional matching method .",
    "this work has shown that the latter is hardly applicable to deep optical surveys since it leads to a large fraction of spurious matches ( @xmath100 ) . with our technique instead",
    "the rate of spurious matches is lower due to the exploitation of the information given by the probability distribution of background sources in the optical catalogs .",
    "we have also shown that to reach the same level of spurious contamination with the cross - correlation method the fraction of identified sources decreases by @xmath101 . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "i.e. in the nir and in the mir , the differences of the two methods are negligible .",
    "we find a comparable fraction of expected spurious counterparts and a similar completeness .",
    "this is mainly due to the lower background surface density of objects in the auxiliary catalogs . in section",
    "[ sec - revisited ] we point out two cases where the likelihood ratio method can fail in identifying the correct optical counterpart , that is the presence of many close sources around the radio object and extended radio emission .",
    "we note that with the cross - correlation method these problems are even more severe ; in crowded regions it selects the closest source , regardless of its properties . in case of extended radio sources",
    ", there could be an offset between the peak of the emission at different wavelengths larger than the searching radius . in this case , the cross - correlation method would not be able to give any counterpart candidate .",
    "comparison with m08 work .",
    "_ compared with the sample studied in m08 , our sample is about 3 times larger and most of the new sources have a low radio flux density or lie at the edges of the e - cdfs .",
    "that makes their identification more challenging . however , more and deeper catalogs are now available in the e - cdfs and , using these data , we were able to reach the same identification completeness as in m08 for the new sample .",
    "we find general agreement between the counterparts found in the two works for the radio sources in common .",
    "the main improvement is a more reliable identification in particular of the optically faint radio sources , obtained by adopting a stricter acceptance criteria and giving more importance to the ir selected catalogs ( section [ sec - comparisonm08 ] ) . 5 .   _ importance of mir observations to find the counterpart of high redshift or heavily obscured radio objects . _",
    "some radio sources ( 12% ) have a reliable counterpart only in the catalogs based on the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "these sources are particularly interesting since they are the best candidate high - z objects . in sec .",
    "[ sec - z - distr ] , we describe the redshift distribution of the radio sources divided according to their identification band . indeed , we find a clear trend for sources identified at longer wavelengths to have higher redshifts , as shown in fig .",

    "moreover , the stacking analysis of the x - ray images of the mir selected sources , has revealed that they tend , on average , to have hard x - ray spectra ( @xmath102 ) .",
