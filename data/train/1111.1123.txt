    "the schwinger model is quantum electrodynamics of massless fermions in 1 space and 1 time dimension  @xcite and serves as a popular testing ground for non - perturbative methods in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "it is an exactly solvable , super - renormalizable gauge theory that exhibits various interesting phenomena  @xcite , such as confinement , which one would like to understand better in 1 + 3-dimensional qfts .",
    "originally it was solved by means of functional methods  @xcite .",
    "later on also operator solutions were found  @xcite and spectrum and eigenstates of the theory were calculated by quantizing it at equal time @xmath1",
    "@xcite or at equal light - cone time @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we rather attempt to solve the schwinger model by means of canonical quantization on the space - time hyperboloid @xmath3 .",
    "each of these quantization hypersurfaces is associated with a particular form of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite , namely the instant form , the front form and the point form , respectively .",
    "the quantization surface in point form is a space - time hyperboloid which is invariant under the action of the lorentz group .",
    "the kinematic ( interaction independent ) generators of the poincar group are therefore those of the lorentz subgroup .",
    "all the interactions go into the components of the 2-momentum @xmath4 , i.e. the generators of space - time translations , which provide the dynamics of the system .",
    "one of the main virtues of point - form dynamics is obviously a simple behavior of wave functions and operators under lorentz transformations .",
    "this has already been exploited in applications to relativistic few - body systems  @xcite , but corresponding studies of interacting quantum field theories are still very sparse .",
    "the best - known paper is that of fubini et al .",
    "@xcite , who deal with point - form qft in 2-dimensional euclidean space - time .",
    "we rather want to extend equal-@xmath5 quantization in minkowski space - time , as it was worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite for free field theories , to the interacting case .",
    "the solution being known , the schwinger model would be an interesting example to test the point - form approach against other methods .",
    "the hope is then that point - form quantum field theory will eventually represent a useful alternative in the study of 4-dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "the lagrangian of the schwinger model is @xmath6 with the @xmath7 dirac matrices being represented , as usual , in the weyl basis , i.e. , and .",
    "this exposition follows closely ref .",
    "@xcite to which we refer for further details .    [ [ fermions ] ] fermions : + + + + + + + + +    in order to obtain the fock - space representation of the free fermion 2-momentum operator , we fourier - expand the dirac field @xmath8 in terms of plane waves using the fermion and antifermion annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the spinor basis @xmath11 . in the massless case ,",
    "the spinors are ( @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 the free fermion 2-momentum operator in point - form is then obtained from the stress - energy tensor @xmath14 by integrating over the space - time hyperboloid @xmath15 : @xmath16 inserting now the plain - wave expansion for the fields and interchanging momentum and @xmath17 integrations we are left with the covariant distribution @xmath18 q_\\nu - \\frac{2 i \\tau}{\\sqrt{-q^2}}\\theta(-q^2 ) k_1(\\tau \\sqrt{-q^2})\\ , q_\\nu\\ , .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when evaluating equation for the free parts of the lagrangian , @xmath19 is contracted with spinor products of the form @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",
    "all the contractions with @xmath22 vanish and only the term @xmath23 survives .",
    "the result , as already shown by biernat et al .",
    "@xcite using a different trick to evaluate @xmath19 , is ( after normal ordering ) @xmath24 i.e. the same as in instant form .",
    "[ [ photons ] ] photons : + + + + + + + +    for the free photon 2-momentum operator we proceed in an analogous way .",
    "the fourier expansion of the vector potential @xmath25 in terms of plane waves gives rise to the photon creation- and annihilation operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 and to polarization vectors @xmath28 , with @xmath29 labeling the polarization .",
    "the polarization vectors are orthonormalized according to @xmath30 . in order to preserve the nice covariance properties of the point form , we work within the lorenz gauge and use the gupta - bleuler quantization procedure . as a consequence",
    "there are no physical photons left .",
    "the 0- and the 1-component of the photon field are pure gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "proceeding in analogy to the fermion part we find for the fock - space representation of the free photon 2-momentum operator again the same result as for equal - time quantization , i.e. @xmath31      since there is no derivative in the interaction part of the lagrangian , the interaction part of the stress - energy tensor is simply given by .",
    "the interaction part of the 2-momentum operator is then @xmath32 one can check explicitly that the corresponding integral for the interaction part of the boost generator vanishes as expected  @xcite .    to obtain the fock - space representation of @xmath33 we proceed as before .",
    "the only difference is now that @xmath34 does not provide a momentum conserving @xmath35 function .",
    "but this is not surprising .",
    "both components of the momentum operator are interaction dependent so that one can not expect momentum conservation at interaction vertices .",
    "but what one can do is to analyze the algebraic structure of @xmath33 . by appropriately collecting terms",
    "it can be cast into the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 the distribution @xmath38 for different combinations of the momenta @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 together with the different spinor products determines essentially the elements of the @xmath42 matrix @xmath43 .",
    "putting all the pieces together we finally end up with the eigenvalue problem @xmath44 which we want to solve non - perturbatively .",
    "here we have also expressed the fermion kinetic energy in terms of the @xmath45s to emphasize that the fermion creation and annihilation operators occur only in bilinear combinations .",
    "the argument @xmath46 is essentially a diagonal matrix containing @xmath47 .",
    "a possible strategy to solve this eigenvalue problem was proposed in ref .",
    "the first step is to keep the number of modes finite .",
    "this could , e.g. , be done without spoiling lorentz - transformation properties by compactifying the @xmath48 direction such that one ends up with a desitter space .",
    "a finite number of modes means also that only a finite number of fermion - antifermion pairs can be created . in order to keep the number of bosons finite the boson algebra",
    "is then considered as a contraction limit of another unitary algebra that restricts the number of bosons in any mode . in this way",
    "one ends up with a solvable algebraic problem that involves only a finite number of modes and a finite number of particles",
    ". the interesting question will be whether the well known results for schwinger model are recovered upon performing the necessary contractions that restore the original theory .",
