    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell ( i.e. , weighting is equal to the inverse of density ) , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "we allow the whole feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating , as in nature .",
    "the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported into right directions in a physically sound ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) way , at least in a statistical sense . in our simulations metals",
    "are followed hydrodynamically by solving the metal density continuity equation with sources ( from star formation feedback ) and sinks ( due to subsequent star formation ) .",

    "the primary advantages of this supernova energy based feedback mechanism are three - fold .",

    "second , it has only one free parameter @xmath68 , namely , the fraction of the rest mass energy of stars formed that is deposited as thermal energy on the cell scale at the location of supernovae .",
    "third , the processes are treated physically , obeying their respective conservation laws ( where they apply ) , allowing transport of metals , mass , energy and momentum to be treated self - consistently and taking into account relevant heating / cooling processes at all times .",

    "given the uncertainties on the evolution of imf with redshift ( i.e. , possibly more top heavy at higher redshift ) and the fact that newly discovered prompt type i supernovae contribute a comparable amount of energy compared to type ii supernovae , it seems that our adopted value for @xmath68 is consistent with observations and physically realistic .",
    "the validity of this thermal energy - based feedback approach comes empirically . in @xcite the metal distribution in and around galaxies over a wide range of redshift ( @xmath71 )",

    "this is non - trivial by any means , because they require that the transport of metals and energy from galaxies to star formation sites to megaparsec scale be correctly modeled as a function of distance over the entire cosmic timeline , at least in a statistical sense .",

    "we generate synthetic absorption spectra given the density , temperature , metallicity and velocity fields in simulations .",
    "each absorption line is identified by the velocity ( or wavelength ) interval between one downward - crossing and the next upward - crossing points at flux equal to @xmath75 ( flux equal to unity corresponds to an unabsorbed continuum flux ) in the spectra .",

    "this significant difference found with respect to the strong o  vi absorber - galaxy cross correlations between the photoionization and collisional ionization dominated models stems from the relative difference in the locations of strong o  vi absorbers in the two models . in the collisional ionization dominated model @xcite the strong o  vi absorbers are spatially closer to galaxies in order to have high enough temperature ( hence high o  vi abundance ) and high enough density to make strong o  vi absorbers , whereas in the photoionization dominated model @xcite they have to be sufficiently far from galaxies to have low enough densities to be photoionized to o  vi .",

    "in other words , either ( 1 ) energy is supplied to sustain existing o  vi gas or ( 2 ) new warm gas is accreted or ( 3 ) some hotter gas needs to continuously cool through the warm phase .",
    "since o  vi gas by itself does not define a set of stable systems and is spatially well mixed or in close proximity with other phases of gas , this suggests that the o  vi gas in halos is _  transient \" _ in nature .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.2 in    -0.5 in    we consider three sources of warm halo gas : mechanical feedback energy from stellar evolution , gravitational binding energy released from halo formation and interactions , and direct accretion from the igm .",

    "restricting our analysis to within a galactocentric radius of @xmath109kpc and reading off numbers from the red curve in figure  [ fig : ratiolrsub ] , we obtain two relations : @xmath110 an additional reasonable assumption is now made : feedback heating rate @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) is proportional to average star formation rate @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , which in turn is proportional to their respective gas accretion rate @xmath31 ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "lastly , a direct assessment of the relative strength of gravitational heating of warm gas in blue and red galaxies is obtained by making the following ansatz : the amount of hot @xmath122k gas is proportional to the overall heating rate , to which the gravitational heating rate of warm gas is proportional .",
    "figure  [ fig : lr011e4gascompgasmass ] shows the gas mass of the three halo gas components interior to the radius shown in the x - axis . within the galactocentric radius of @xmath109kpc it is found that the amount of hot halo gas per red @xmath1 galaxy is twice that of per blue @xmath1 galaxy : @xmath123 solving equations ( [ eq : source2],[eq : sfr],[eq : grav ] ) yields @xmath124 the estimate given in equations ( [ eq : grav ] ) is admittedly uncertain .",

    "we also compute the mean metallicities ( in solar units ) for the inflow and outflow warm gas , which are the second and third of the three elements in each entry in table 1 .",
    "four separated cases are given : ( 1 ) red galaxies in c run ( c red ) , ( 2 ) red galaxies in v run ( v red ) , ( 3 ) blue galaxies in c run ( c blue ) , ( 4 ) blue galaxies in v run ( v blue ) . in order to make sure that inflow and outflow are not confused with random motions of gas in a maxwellian like distribution , we separately limit the magnitude of infall and outflow radial velocities to greater than @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and listed the computed quantities under the third column @xmath147 and the fourth column @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to first take a closer look at the difference in metallicities between inflow and outflow gas . the warm inflow gas in red galaxies in the c run has consistently higher metallicity than warm outflow gas , @xmath149 versus @xmath150 .",
    "the opposite holds for red galaxies in the v run : @xmath151 versus @xmath152 . the warm inflow gas in blue galaxies in the c run",
    "has about the same metallicity as warm outflow gas at @xmath153 .",
    "the warm inflow gas in blue galaxies in the v run , on the other hand , has a substantially lower metallicity than the warm outflow gas , @xmath154 versus @xmath155 . except in the case of c blue",
    ", we note that the inflow and outflow gas has different metallicities , with the difference being larger when a higher flow velocitiy is imposed in the selection .",
    "this difference in metallicity demonstrates that the _ warm inflows and outflows are distinct dynamical entities _ , not random motions in a well - mixed gas , making our distinction of inflows and outflows physically meaningful",
    ". a physical explanation for the metallicity trends found can be made as follows . in low density environment ( i.e. , in the v run )",
    "circumgalactic medium has not been enriched to a high level and hot gas is not prevalent . as a result , warm ( and possibly cold ) inflows of relatively low metallicities still exist at low redshift .",
    "the progression from blue to red galaxies in the v run reflects a progression from very low density regions ( i.e. , true voids ) to dense filaments and group environments , with higher metallicities for both inflows and outflows in the denser environments in the v run ; but the difference between inflow and outflow metallicities remains . for red galaxies in high density environments ( c run )",
    "the circumgalactic medium has been enriched to higher metallicities .",
    "higher cooling rates of higher - metallicity gas in relatively hot environments preferentially produces higher - metallicity warm gas that originates from hot gas and has now cooled to become warm gas .",
    "the blue galaxies in the c run are primarily in cosmic filaments and the metallicity of the inflow gas is about @xmath156 , which happens to coincide with the metallicity of the outflow gas .",
    "one needs to realize that at the radial shell @xmath157$]kpc over which the tabulated quantities are computed , the outflow gas originated in star forming regions has loaded a substantial amount of interstellar and circumgalactic medium in the propagation process .",
    "let us now turn to the warm inflow and outflow metal mass .",
    "it appears that the fraction of inflow warm metals ( out of all warm metals ) lies in a relatively narrow range @xmath158 . for our present purpose",
    "we will just say @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "armed with these two relations our best estimates for various contributions to the observed warm halo metals , as a good proxy for the o  vi absorption , can be summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath161 for red @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath95 contributions to warm metals in the halo gas from star formation feedback ( @xmath30 ) , accretion of intergalactic medium ( @xmath31 ) and gravitational shock heating ( @xmath32 ) are @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath161 for blue @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath95 contributions to warm metals in the halo gas from the three sources are @xmath163 .",
    "@xmath161 dependencies of warm halo gas metallicities on galaxy type and environment are complex but physically understandable . for red galaxies , the metallicity of inflowing warm gas increases with increasing environmental overdensity , whereas that of outflowing warm gas decreases with increasing environmental overdensity . for blue galaxies",
    ", the metallicity of inflowing warm gas depends very weakly on environmental overdensity , whereas that of outflowing warm gas decreases with increasing environmental overdensity . as a whole ,",
    "the mean metallicity of warm halo gas in red galaxies is @xmath35 , while that of blue galaxies is @xmath36 .",
    "we suggest that these estimates of source fractions are not seriously in error on average , if one is satisfied with an accuracy of a factor of two .",
    "the relative metallicity estimates should be quite robust with errors much smaller than a factor of two .",
    "it is stressed that these estimates are averaged over many red and blue galaxies and one is not expected to have been led to think that the correlations ( such as between warm gas mass and sfr ) hold strictly for individual galaxies .",
    "rather , we expect large variations from galaxy to galaxy , even at a fixed star formation rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : m56sfr ] makes this important point clear , which shows that , while there is a positive correlation between warm metal mass within @xmath109kpc radius and sfr for galaxies with non - negligible sfr ( i.e. , appearing in the sfr range shown ) , a dispersion of @xmath11 dex in warm metal mass at a fixed sfr in the range of @xmath164  yr@xmath165 exists .",
    "the goodness of the fit can be used as a way to rephrase this significant dispersion .",
    "if one assumes that the errorbar size is each log mass determination for each shown galaxy is 1 , one finds that the chi - square per degree of the fitting line ( green ) is @xmath166 , indicating that the correlation between @xmath167 and @xmath168 is only good to about @xmath169 dex in warm metal gas mass .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.2 in    -0.5 in      in @xcite we show that the properties of o  vi absorption lines at low redshift , including their abundance , doppler - column density distribution , temperature range , metallicity and coincidence between o  vii and o  vi lines , are all in good agreement with observations @xcite . in the above we have shown that o  vi - galaxies relations as well as oxygen mass in galaxies in the simulations are also in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "these tests together are non - trivial and lend us significant confidence to now examine the overall composition of halo gas at low - z .    -0.0 cm -0.45 in -0.5 in    -0.5 in    -0.0 cm -0.45 in -0.5 in    -0.5 in    figure  [ fig : lr011e4gascompperc ] shows the differential ( left panel ) and cumulative ( right panel ) mass fractions of each gas component as a function of galactocentric distance for red ( red curves ) and blue ( blue curves ) galaxies .",
    "we note that the fluctuating behaviors ( mostly in the differential functions on the left panel ) are due to occasional dense cold clumps in neighboring galaxies .",
    "overall , we see that within about ( 10,30)kpc for ( red , blue ) galaxies",
    "the cold ( @xmath24k ) gas component completely dominates , making up about ( 80% , @xmath170% ) of all gas at these radii . for both @xmath139 ( red , blue ) galaxies",
    "cold gas remains the major component up to @xmath6kpc , within which its mass comprises 50% of all gas . at @xmath7kpc for ( red , blue ) galaxies the hot ( @xmath27k ) gas component dominates",
    "the warm gas component , while having been extensively probed observationally , appears to be a minority in both red and blue galaxies at all radii .",
    "the warm component s contribution to the overall gas content reaches its peak value of @xmath8 at @xmath9kpc for blue galaxies , whereas in red galaxies it is negligible at @xmath171kpc and hovers around 5% level at @xmath172kpc .",
    "the prevalence of cold gas at small radii in red ( i.e. , low star formation activities ) galaxies is intriguing and perhaps surprising to some extent .",
    "some recent observations indicate that early - type galaxies in the real universe do appear to contain a substantial amount of cold gas , consistent with our findings .",
    "for example , @xcite infer a mean mass of @xmath173 of gas with @xmath24k at @xmath174kpc based on a sample of @xmath175 early - type galaxies at low redshift from cos observations , which is shown as the red square ( its horizontal position is slightly shifted to the right for display clarity ) in figure  [ fig : lr011e4gascompgasmass ] .",
    "their inferred range is in fact consistent with our computed value of @xmath176 of cold @xmath24k gas for red @xmath139 galaxies shown as the red dashed curve in figure  [ fig : lr011e4gascompgasmass ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : lr011e4mtlcompperc ] that is analogous to figure  [ fig : lr011e4gascompperc ] shows the corresponding distributions for metals mass fractions in the three components for red and blue galaxies .",
    "the overall trends are similar to those for total warm gas mass .",
    "we note one significant difference here .",
    "the overall dominance of metals mass in cold gas extends further out radially for both red and blue galaxies , whereas the contributions to metal mass from the other two components are compensatorily reduced .",
    "for example , we find that the radius within which the cold mass component makes up 50% of total gas in ( red , blue ) galaxies is ( 40,150)kpc , where the radius within which the cold mass component makes up 50% of total gas metals in ( red , blue ) galaxies becomes ( 200,500)kpc .",
    "this is largely due to a significantly higher metallicity of the cold component in both red and blue galaxies compared to the other two components , as shown in figure  [ fig : zmtlprofl011e4 ] .",
    "we also note from figure  [ fig : zmtlprofl011e4 ] that the warm gas in red galaxies has a higher metallicity than in blue galaxies , as found earlier , with the mean metallicity ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) in ( red , blue ) galaxies within a radius of @xmath109kpc .    -0.0 cm -0.2 in    -0.5 in",
    "the distribution and evolution of the intergalactic medium have largely been addressed by cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the global distribution and composition of halo gas in and around galaxies at low redshift ( @xmath0 ) are addressed here , utilizing state - of - the - art high - resolution ( @xmath17pc ) , large - scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with validated star formation and feedback prescriptions .",
    "we find that within about ( 10,30)kpc for ( red , blue ) @xmath139 galaxies the cold ( @xmath24k ) gas component is the primary gas component making up about ( 80% , @xmath170% ) of all gas . for both @xmath139 ( red , blue ) galaxies",
    "cold gas remains the major component up to @xmath6kpc , within which its mass comprises 50% of all gas . at @xmath7kpc for ( red , blue ) galaxies the hot ( @xmath27k ) gas component dominates .",

    "the warm component s contribution to the overall gas content reaches its peak value of @xmath8 at @xmath9kpc for blue galaxies , whereas in red galaxies its contribution is negligible at @xmath171kpc and capped at 5% level at @xmath172kpc .",
    "where comparisons with observations are possible , we find that the amount of warm gas and and oxygen mass in star forming galaxies are in agreement with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so is the amount of cold gas in early - type galaxies at low redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of a significant amount cold gas in red galaxies at low redshift is new and somewhat surprising .",
    "the nature of this cold gas and its role in star formation in red galaxies are not addressed in the present paper .",
    "this and signatures of the predicted dominance of hot gas in blue galaxies ( as well as red galaxies ) at large radii will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "in addition to the agreement between our simulations and observations with respect to the global o  vi incidence rate @xcite , we show that our predicted correlations between galaxies and strong o  vi absorbers of column density @xmath178@xmath94 are in excellent agreement with observations with @xmath88 square per degree of freedom equal to @xmath89 . on the other hand ,",
    "when we use only photoionized o  vi absorbers ( @xmath90k ) in the simulations , the comparisons between simulations and observations become substantially less favorable with @xmath88 square per degree of freedom equal to @xmath91 ; the significant disagreement stems from the photoionized o  vi absorbers being too distant from galaxies .",
    "the o  vi line incidence rate per @xmath1 galaxy around blue ( @xmath179 ) galaxies in our simulations is higher than that around @xmath180 red ( @xmath73 ) galaxies by a factor of @xmath181 at @xmath182kpc , increasing to @xmath183 at @xmath184kpc , in reasonable agreement with extant observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas in the photoionization dominated model the ratio is zero at @xmath185kpc .",
    "thus , the cross correlations between galaxies and o  vi lines provide powerful differentiation between collisional and photo ionization models , with collisional ionization dominance for strong ( @xmath186@xmath94 ) o  vi absorbers being favored currently .",
    "the o  vi - bearing halo gas ( i.e. , the warm component ) is found to be _  transient \" _ in nature and hence requires constant sources .",
    "we perform analysis to unravel the sources and their relations to galaxy formation .",
    "we find that , on average , to within a factor of two , contributions to warm metals in the halo gas from star formation feedback ( @xmath30 ) , accretion of intergalactic medium ( @xmath31 ) and gravitational shock heating ( @xmath32 ) are @xmath187 for red @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath95 . for blue @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath95 contributions",
