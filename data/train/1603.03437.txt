    "second , significant blueshifts of the _ entire _  profile ( i.e. , not necessarily a specific sub - component of the line ) , reaching several 1000s ^-1 kms@xmath14 , are ubiquitously measured in the vast majority of agn @xcite .",
    "some of these findings were explained either by a disc outflow wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the analysis presented in this paper is based on a sample of luminous , type - i agn in a narrow redshift range around @xmath0 , for which we have obtained high signal to noise ( @xmath30 ) single epoch spectroscopic observations using the x - shooter instrument on the very large telescope .",
    "the 39  sources span a range in brightness of @xmath31 .",
    "the sample selection , data acquisition and reduction for the 30  brightest sources were described in detail in paper i , and information about 9 other sources , obtained in eso program 092.b-0613 , is provided in paper iii .",
    "here we only briefly highlight a few essential aspects .",
    "the sample has been selected from the seventh data release of the sdss @xcite to homogeneously map the parameter space of  and . for the purposes of target selection , these quantities were initially obtained by spectral fitting of the  broad emission line in the sdss spectra as part of the large compilation described in tn12 . in figure .",
    "[ fig : mlledd ] we show  vs  using updated values calculated in this paper based on the  broad emission line and following the procedure that we describe in section [ subsec : mass ] .    at the chosen redshift range of the sample , x - shooter covers the rest - frame wavelength from about 1200  to 9200 .",
    "this broad spectral coverage has allowed us , after correction for galactic extinction , to successfully model and constrain the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "as shown in papers i and iii , we obtain satisfactory thin ad model fits to 37 sources , 6 of which require an intrinsic reddening correction for a satisfactory fit .",
    "the wide wavelength coverage , together with the homogeneous selection of the sample in the @xmath32 plane , enables us to test the performance of the single epoch black hole mass estimators for the , ,  and   lines and estimate the systemic bias induced when the physical sed is unknown .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sn ] we show the the signal to noise ratios ( @xmath30 ) for our x - shooter spectra , measured at the peaks of each of the main emission lines under study , as well as at the corresponding continuum bands , as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "we note that , even in the spectral region which overlaps with the available sdss spectra , the x - shooter data provide a significant improvement in terms of @xmath30 and spectral resolution ( see an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : xshvssdss ] , described in appendix  [ app : xs_sdss_example ] ) .",
    "all the sources have fairly high @xmath30 ( @xmath34 ) at the peaks of the  and  lines and the adjacent continuum bands .",
    "however , this is not the case for  and .",
    "the continuum bands adjacent to  are much noisier .",
    "most of the objects have @xmath35 , and for those with @xmath36 , the ratio is below 10 . nevertheless , we are able to obtain reliable  line measurement because most objects have fairly high @xmath30 at their  line peak ( 34 out of 39 object have @xmath37 and all of them have @xmath38 )",
    ". moreover , the relevant continuum bands around  have low levels of contamination from iron or other , unresolved spectral features .",
    "consequently , even a moderate continuum @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath393 ) is enough to have reliable  fits .",
    "there are however 4 objects where @xmath40 and their line measurements , especially their  are somewhat uncertain .    unfortunately , the  line measurements are more problematic .",
    "in addition to the fact that  is the weakest of the lines of interest , we can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : sn ] that the relevant continuum band in 21 out of 39 objects have @xmath41 , and 14 of them are actually below @xmath42 .",
    "near infrared ( nir ) telluric absorption is another issue that could also crucially affect  line measurements .",
    "the spectral regions with known low atmospheric transmission in the nir , between   and between 13000  to 15000  typically translate to rest - frame bands at 4200 - 4500  and 5300 - 5800  at the redshift of the sample .",
    "these bands are known to show strong iron emission which are suppressed by such telluric absorption ( see the example spectrum in fig . [",
    "fig : global ] around 4400 and 5500 ) .",
    "the combined effect of the telluric absorption and the limited @xmath30 achieved for the fainter sources severely affects the correct modeling of their iron emission around .",
    "this , in turn , significantly increases the measurement uncertainties related to , ultimately making  measurements of faint objects less reliable .",
    "fortunately , the  line shows very similar profiles to  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which is in accordance with the expected radial ionization stratification of the blr @xcite . based on these results",
    ", we can probe several aspects related to the  line using the more reliable  measurements .",
    "in this section we describe the analysis procedures we used to model the x - shooter spectra and to obtain continuum and line emission measurements .",
    "we discuss separately the analysis of emission corresponding to the continuum , the blended iron features , and the emission line components .",
    "all the spectral modeling is done by employing the levenberg - marquardt algorithm for @xmath43 minimization , using the ` python ` based spectroscopic analysis package ` pyspeckit ` @xcite .",
    "the fitting is preformed in the rest frame , after shifting the spectra using the improved sdss redshifts provided by @xcite .",
    "we chose to use these redshifts , instead of using the  line observed within the x - shooter data , because of the limited quality of the relevant data and modeling of the -  spectral region ( see  [ sec : data ] ) and the weak or absent  emission in many of our sources .",
    "we adopt here two different approaches to account for the continuum emission of the agn , which we refer to as the _ local  _ and _ global  _ ( thin disk ) continuum approaches .",
    "the _ local  _ continuum attempts to account for the usual approximation of the continuum emission by a single power law when the observed spectrum is limited to a narrow wavelength range .",
    "the _ global  _ thin disk continuum , on the other hand , corresponds to the more physically - motivated ad model , that was obtained through a bayesian analysis taking advantage of our wide spectral wavelength coverage ( see paper i ) .",
    "a comparison of the measurements obtained with both approaches will allow us to quantify the possible bias imposed by ignoring the real sed shape , when wide - enough wavelength coverage is not available .",
    "the _ local  _ continuum approach consists of separately fitting the continuum emission surrounding each of the lines of interest . for every source in the sample ,",
    "each of these continua is approximated by a single power law , which connects neighboring spectral windows known to have little line contamination .",

    "all these biases are in the direction of an overestimation of the continuum emission when the _",
    "local  _ approach  is used which will translate into  and line flux underestimation .",
    "an additional bias comes from the shape of the sed , particularly at the turn over of most spectra at around 1000 - 1500  ( exact wavelengths depend on bm mass , spin and accretion rate , see papers i and iii ) .",
    "the simple power - law approximation to the sed does not remain valid over this range and may lead to measurement biases of the line profile properties of   and  ( hereafter ) . in this paper",
    "we use our ad sed fittings to quantify these biases .",
    "the _ global  _ ad approach is based on the best fits from the thin - accretion - disk continuum models obtained for each of the sources in papers i and iii . for the analysis in this paper",
    "we do not consider the two objects with no satisfactory fits to the thin disk continuum model .",
    "as explained in paper i and iii , the seds of the ad models used in this work are determined by , the accretion rate ( ) , the spin ( ) and the inclination of the disc with respect to the line - of - sight ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we adopted a bayesian procedure to fit the thin ad model spectra to the observed x - shooter seds .  and",
    "were taken as priors with gaussian distributions centered on the observed values , obtained from  and  measurements ( following the procedures described in this paper ) , and with standard deviations of 0.3 and 0.2 dex , respectively .    within the _",
    "global  _ continuum approach we also consider the bc emission that peaks near the balmer edge ( 3647 ) and gradually decreases towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "the balmer continuum model we used is based on calculations of the photo - ionization code ion @xcite with an h - atom containing 40 levels , solar abundances , hydrogen density of @xmath46 , column density of @xmath47 and ionization parameter of @xmath48 .",
    "the exact shape is insensitive to the exact value of these parameters and the normalization is done by direct fits to the observations .    an additional contribution to the continuum emission is due to starlight , mostly at wavelengths longer than about 6000 . for our agn sample",
    "such a contribution is marginal in 32 out of 39 objects and does not severely affect the continuum level and shape of the agn sed as discussed in paper i and iii ( @xmath203% at 6200 ) .",
    "for the 7 fainter objects we used the method described in paper iii which assumes a template from an 11 gyr old stellar population to model the host galaxy emission .",
    "the scale factor of the template is determined from the ratio of the measured @xmath49 and the median value of the @xmath49 distribution of the 29 brightest objects , as discussed in paper iii .",
    "the host galaxy contribution is subtracted before the thin disk continuum fitting for those objects which require this correction .",
    "we find that in this sub - sample the host galaxy contribution is between 6% and 50% at 6200  and smaller than 3% at 3000 .",
    "we also tested several stellar populations in the age range from 1 to 11 gyr , but we find no significant changes in the corrected spectrum ( see paper iii for details )",
    ".    finally , combining the x - shooter spectra obtained by three different arms ( uv , optical and nir ) may introduce additional uncertainties .",
    "as explained in paper i , in most cases , the overlap and connection between the vis and uvb arms are satisfactory , with no need for further adjustments but this is not the case for the vis - nir joint , as can be seen for j0043 in fig .",
    "[ fig : global ] . for several objects , the slope of the vis arm",
    "was adjusted based on comparison to sdss ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "we therefore allow our fitting to rescale the _",
    "global  _ continuum up to 10% in each of the regions covered by each arm ( 1200 - 2200 , 2200 - 4000 , 4000 - 9000 ) to take into account the arm calibration uncertainties .",
    "for an adequate modeling of  and  line profiles it is crucial to first subtract the iron line emission , originating from a large number of blended features of  and fe iii .",
    "generally , this is done by choosing the best - fit broadened , shifted and scaled empirical iron line template .",
    "we constrain line center shifts to be smaller than 1000 ^ -1 kms@xmath14  and broadening is constrained to the range 1000 - 20000 ^ -1 kms@xmath14 . for the optical region around  ( 4000 - 7000 ) we used the iron template from @xcite . for the uv region around   ( 1700 - 3647 )",
    "we initially used the @xcite template ( hereafter t06 ) .",
    "however , the fits obtained using this template was not satisfactory , mainly due to an over - estimation of the continuum emission .",
    "we therefore built a new iron template ( see apppendix [ app : fe_template ] and figure [ fig : feiitemplate ] ) based on the spectrum of i  zw  1 reported by t06 , which is a composite of their uv ( hst ) observation and the optical ( kpno ) observation reported by @xcite .",
    "one of the main differences between the _",
    "local  _ and _ global  _ approaches is that under the _ local  _ approach different scaling factors for the uv iron template at each side of the  line are required in order to guarantee an acceptable match to the observed spectrum .",
    "the scale factor in the red side of  is found to be always larger than the one for the blue side , but by no more than 10% .",
    "this type of correction is not needed in the _",
    "global  _ approach , when the complete continuum model ( ad+bc ) is considered . given",
    "that under the _ local  _ approach  the bc can not be accounted for directly and that the bc is monotonically increasing from 2200 to 3647 , we suspect that the larger scale factor in the red side of  might be due to the bc and not to intrinsic changes in iron line emission .      for the emission line modeling we have followed a procedure similar to the one described in tn12 ( see their appendix c ) and @xcite in short , after removing the continuum emission ( following either the _ local  _ or _ global  _ approaches ) and the iron template , we model the prominent broad emission lines with two broad gaussian components . we allow for a range of line widths and shifts for each component , where the  ranges between 1000 ^ -1 kms@xmath14  and 10000 ^ -1 kms@xmath14and the line shifts are limited to @xmath50 for the ,   and  lines , while for the  line we allowed blue - shifts of up to -3000 ^ -1 kms@xmath14 .",
    "these different choices are motivated by the findings of several earlier studies ( e.g. , @xcite , s07 , r13 , @xcite ) . in the case of doublet lines (   and )",
    ", we used 4 gaussians , forcing the two broad and two narrower components to have the same profiles and intensity , and the theoretical wavelength separation .",
    "we fixed the  and  doublet intensity ratios to 1:1 , suitable for optically thick line emission .",
    "for each of the ,   and  lines we have also included a third gaussian component when needed to account for the additional emission originating from the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "each of these narrow components are modeled by a single gaussian profile , their  is constrained not to exceed 1300 ^-1 kms@xmath14 , and their line centers are tied to each other , with shifts of 400 ^ -1 kms@xmath14 , at most .",
    "we chose not to include a narrow component in the modeling of the  and  lines ( as in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since we found no significant difference in the  measurements ( or fit quality ) when trying to include it . , and at most @xmath51 , of the total line luminosity",
    "] for other , weaker emission lines ( including heii1640 , niv1718 , siiii]1892 ) we used only a single gaussian component .",
    "these lines are not necessary for the purpose of the present work except for limiting the continuum placement .",
    "more accurate modeling of these lines will be a topic of the fourth paper in this series .",
    "all the gaussian components we used are symmetric and defined by three parameters : peak flux density , , and central wavelength .",
    "we have made several simple , physically motivated simplifying assumptions , in order to minimize the number of free parameters : the gaussian components of lines of the same species were forced to share an identical width ; we have also tied together the relative shifts in the central wavelengths of some lines , based on their laboratory wavelengths ; and assume line - intensity ratios for some lines based on their statistical weights ( see appendix  [ app : fitting_params ] and table  [ tab : line_const ] for further details on the different emission line parameters , their assumed ranges , inter - connections and delimitation of the emission line regions ) .",
    "our line fitting procedure runs separately on each of the main emission line regions , while all the lines in each line region are fitted simultaneously .    generally , the _ global  _ ( see figure [ fig : global ] ) and _ local  _ ( see figure [ fig : local ] ) continuum approaches follow the same line fitting procedures in terms of the number of components per emission line and the way they are tied together .",
    "one important difference is that in the _ global  _ approach ,",
    "the  and   line regions are considered a single region and are therefore fitted simultaneously .",

    ", we performed 100 monte - carlo realizations for each of the spectra . in each of these realizations , the flux density at each spectral pixel was altered from the observed value by a random , normally distributed value , assuming the corresponding level of noise ( i.e. , using the noise spectrum ) . from these sets of best - fit models we extracted , for each emission line , the line width , the velocity dispersion (; following @xcite ) , integrated luminosity ( @xmath52 ) , rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) , the luminosity at the peak of the fitted profile ( @xmath53 ) as well as its corresponding wavelength ( @xmath54 ) and the offset of the line center ( relative to the laboratory wavelength ; @xmath55 ) .",
    "the line offsets were calculated using the flux - weighted central wavelength of the broad line profile : @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the flux density of the broad line profile at @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is the integrated broad line flux , @xmath60 ; @xmath61 is the laboratory wavelength of the line ; and @xmath62 is the speed of light .",
    "the best - fit values for all these parameters were taken from the medians of the parameter distribution , and the corresponding uncertainties were estimated from the central 68% percentiles .",
    "this `` re - sampling '' approach for the estimation of measurement - related uncertainties was used in several recent studies of spectral decomposition of agn uv - optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on our experience , such errors reflect the true uncertainties related to measuring emission line profiles , while those provided by the ( statistical ) spectral fitting procedure itself tend to underestimate the `` real '' uncertainties .    the measured parameters , and uncertainties , for the most prominent emission lines under the _ local  _ approach  are summarized in tables [ tab : line_params ] and [ tab : line_params1 ] .",

    "local  _ approach  .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , given the several important spectral features ( bc , feii lines ) that are influencing this spectral region .",
    "line luminosities are more sensitive to continuum placement than the other quantities we examined .",
    "indeed , we found line luminosity median offsets ( @xmath96 ) of @xmath97 dex , @xmath98 dex , @xmath99 dex and @xmath68 dex for , ,  and , respectively .",

    "this implies that using the local approach to estimate line luminosities generally leads to an underestimation of the latter , and its effect is larger for low luminosity objects ( up to 0.14 dex , or 38% , in the case of ) .    in summary , the impact of using the _",
