    "the simplest and cleanest decay modes of the @xmath5 meson , both theoretically and experimentally , are the purely leptonic decays . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", @xmath5 leptonic decays proceed via the annihilation of the @xmath12 and anti-@xmath13 quarks into a virtual @xmath14 boson ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] ) .",
    "the decay rate is predicted  @xcite to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath5 mass , @xmath17 is the lepton mass , @xmath18 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath19 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite element which takes the value equal to @xmath20 of @xmath21 @xcite , and @xmath10 is the decay constant that is related to the wave - function overlap of the quark and antiquark . the @xmath5 meson leptonic decay is a process in which a spin-0 meson decays to a left - handed neutrino or a right - handed antineutrino . according to angular momentum conservation , the lepton @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) must be left - handed ( right - handed ) . as a consequence , the leptonic decay of @xmath5 meson is helicity suppressed , which follows from the @xmath24 dependence of the decay width . taking the phase - space factor @xmath25 into account ,",
    "the leptonic branching fractions are in the ratio @xmath26 .",

    "theoretical predictions of @xmath10 @xcite are lower than this value .",
    "the most precise predictions are from lattice qcd ; the combined @xmath29- and @xmath30-flavor result is @xmath31 .",
    "there is an approximately two standard - deviation difference between the experimental average and the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "several models of physics beyond the sm , such as the two - higgs - doublet model @xcite and the @xmath32-parity - violating model @xcite , may help to understand this difference .",
    "it is important to further investigate this difference both theoretically and experimentally .    in this paper , we report new measurements of the branching fractions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( where we use the decay @xmath35 ) and use them to determine the decay constant @xmath10 .",

    "are only produced in @xmath38 pairs and the cross section of @xmath38 is nearly maximal @xcite .",
    "as other processes , such as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are not allowed kinematically , we benefit from the exceptional purity of the @xmath5 sample . using the technique first introduced by the mark iii collaboration @xcite",
    ", we select single - tag events , where either @xmath5 or @xmath41 is reconstructed , and then reconstruct the leptonic signal on the recoil side ( signal side ) . in this paper",

    "the besiii detector @xcite is designed to study hadron spectroscopy and @xmath53-charm physics @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical besiii is composed of a helium - gas based drift chamber ( mdc ) , a time - of - flight ( tof ) system , a csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) , and a rpc - based muon chamber ( muc ) , with a superconducting magnet providing a @xmath54 magnetic field in the central region of the detector .",
    "the mdc covers the polar angle range @xmath55 , with a momentum resolution of 0.5% for charged particles at 1  gev/@xmath12 and 6% resolution in the specific energy loss @xmath56 .",
    "the tof subdetector consists of two parts , the barrel and end cap .",
    "the intrinsic time resolution for the barrel counters is 80  ps , while for the end - cap counters it is 110  ps . the emc measures energies and positions of electrons and photons with an energy resolution of 2.5% ( 5% ) at an energy of 1  gev in the barrel ( end cap ) region .",
    "the muc is designed to have the ability to identify more than 90% of muons with momentum over 0.5  gev , while misidentifying less than 10% of charged pions as muons .",
