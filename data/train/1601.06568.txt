    "the behavior of the qcd coupling @xmath9 at low momentum transfer @xmath1 is a central field of study in hadron physics .",
    "key questions are the analytic behavior of the coupling in the infrared ( ir ) , such as whether it exhibits a nonzero ir fixed point and whether it displays conformal - like behavior at low momentum transfers . different theoretical approaches to qcd dynamics , such as lattice gauge theory , schwinger - dyson equations and light - front holographic methods use different definitions of the qcd coupling and effective charges to study @xmath10 in the ir domain  @xcite .",
    "knowing the strength of the strong coupling @xmath11 in the nonperturbative domain is necessary for understanding fundamental problems in hadron physics , including the mechanisms for color confinement and the origin of gluonic flux tubes within hadrons .",
    "the magnitude of the coupling at low momentum even has impact on high energy phenomena , such as the amplitude for heavy - quark pair production near threshold  @xcite and the magnitude of the @xmath12-odd sivers effects in semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , no consensus on the ir behavior of @xmath10 .",
    "the diversity of possible behaviors can be partly traced back to the different definitions of @xmath11 in the nonperturbative domain .",
    "for example , one can define the qcd coupling as an  effective charge \" from any perturbatively calculable observable  @xcite .",
    "the various choices for the coupling typically differ from the standard perturbative definition , such as @xmath13 , due to the inclusion of nonperturbative contributions which eliminate an unphysical landau pole in the physical domain .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of the nonperturbative contributions leads to a modification of the behavior of the coupling in the ir domain .",
    "studies which simulate a linear confining potential suggest that @xmath14 diverges as @xmath15 for @xmath16  @xcite . however , this identification is ambiguous , since the linear confining potential for nonrelativistic heavy quarks in the usual instant form of dynamics  @xcite is equivalent , at large separation distances , to a harmonic oscillator potential in the light - front ( lf ) form of relativistic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that unlike qed , the qcd potential can not be uniquely identified with single gluon exchange .",
    "other approaches suggest that @xmath14 vanishes as @xmath16  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the case where @xmath14 becomes constant at low @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this behavior , called the `` freezing '' of the coupling to a fixed ir value , is automatic if one defines the coupling from an effective charge , and it is thus appealing from physical considerations  @xcite . on simple terms , confinement implies that long wavelengths of quarks and gluons are cutoff at a typical hadronic size .",
    "consequently , the effects of quantum loops responsible for the logarithmic dependence of @xmath8 vanish and @xmath8 should freeze to a constant value at hadronic scales  @xcite .",
    "there are considerable variations in the literature on what should be the freezing value of the strong coupling it typically ranges from 0.6 to @xmath18  @xcite . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the choice of renormalization scheme ( rs ) can explain an important part of the spread in the freezing values reported in the literature . as we shall show here , an explicit connection between the large - distance confining dynamics of hadronic physics and the short - distance dynamics of quarks and gluons  @xcite allows one to quantitatively determine this dependence in any rs .",
    "we shall use here the light - front holographic approach to nonperturbative infrared dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this innovative approach to color confinement allows us to determine the behavior of the strong coupling in the ir domain  @xcite . using this framework",
    ", one can show that the first - order semiclassical approximation to the light - front qcd hamiltonian is formally equivalent to the eigenvalue equations in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space  @xcite .",
    "this connection also provides a precise relation between the holographic variable @xmath19 of ads@xmath20 space and the light - front variable @xmath21  @xcite . for a two - particle bound state",
    "the invariant distance squared between the quark and antiquark in the light - front wavefunction of a meson is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the quark s light - front momentum fraction , and @xmath24 is the transverse separation between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is also conjugate to the invariant mass @xmath27 of the @xmath28 system .",
    "light - front holography provides a unification of both light - front kinematics and dynamics : the non - trivial geometry of ads space encodes the kinematical aspects , and the deformation of the action in ads@xmath20 space  described in terms of a specific dilaton profile @xmath29 , encompasses confinement dynamics and determines the effective potential @xmath30 in the light - front hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the resulting light - front hamiltonian predict the regge spectrum of the hadrons , consistent with experiments , and its eigenfunctions determine the light - front wavefunctions underlying form factors , structure functions and other properties of hadrons .",
    "the value of the mass parameter @xmath31 can be determined from a single hadronic input , such as the proton mass : @xmath32 .",
    "a further advantage of the light - front holographic mapping is that one can determine the analytic behavior of the strong coupling in the ir : it has the form @xmath33 .",
    "this prediction follows from the ir modification of ads space , _ i.e. _ , from the same dilaton profile which predicts the regge spectrum  @xcite . as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this form gives a remarkable description of the effective charge @xmath34 determined from measurements of the @xmath5 polarized structure function of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "one can also show that the analytic dependence of the confinement potential is uniquely determined by enforcing conformal symmetry an exact symmetry of the qcd classical lagrangian when quark masses are neglected .",
    "this method , originally discussed by de alfaro , fubini and furlan ( daff ) in the context of one - dimensional quantum field theory allows one to determine uniquely the confinement potential in bound - state equations while keeping the action conformally invariant  @xcite .",
    "one can extend the conformal quantum mechanics of daff to 3 + 1 physical space - time on the light front  @xcite .",
    "the resulting confinement potential is the transverse harmonic oscillator @xmath30 in the light - front hamiltonian which successfully describes hadronic spectra and form factors  @xcite .",
    "conversely , lf holography determines the ads@xmath20 dilaton profile @xmath29 and thus the analytic dependence @xmath33 of the strong coupling in the ir .",
    "this view has received recently strong support from superconformal quantum mechanics  @xcite and its extension to light - front physics  @xcite .",
    "this new approach to hadron physics captures very well the essential physics of qcd confining dynamics and gives remarkable connections between the baryon and meson spectra .",
    "furthermore , it gives remarkable connections across the full heavy - light hadron spectra , where heavy quark masses break the conformal invariance , but the underlying supersymmetry still holds  @xcite . in this framework , the emergent dynamical supersymmetry is not a consequence of supersymmetric qcd , at the level of fundamental fields , but relies on the fact that in @xmath35 a diquark can be in the same color representation as an antiquark , namely a @xmath36 .",
    "we shall show in this paper how the holographic procedure can be extended to describe the strong coupling in the nonperturbative and perturbative domains for any choice of effective charge and rs .",
    "the large momentum - transfer dependence of the coupling @xmath10 is specified by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and its renormalization group equation .",
    "the matching of the high and low momentum transfer regimes of @xmath10 determines the scale @xmath3 which sets the interface between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes .",
    "since the value of @xmath3 determines the starting point for pqcd , it can be used to set the factorization scale for dglap evolution of hadronic structure functions @xcite and the erbl evolution of distribution amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss the dependence of @xmath3 on the choice of the effective charge used to define the running coupling and the rs used to compute its behavior in the perturbative regime .",
    "our analysis also determines the infrared fixed - point behavior of the qcd coupling as well as the value of the infrared fixed point , @xmath37 , for any choice of effective charge and rs .",
    "the qcd coupling @xmath38 can be defined as an  effective charge \"  @xcite satisfying the standard renormalization group evolution equation .",
    "this is analogous to the definition of the qed coupling from the potential between heavy leptons by gell mann and low  @xcite . as we shall show in this section",
    ", the analytic behavior of the running coupling @xmath38 in the low-@xmath17 nonperturbative domain  @xcite can be uniquely predicted using the light - front holographic approach to strongly coupled qcd  @xcite .",
    "it can then be matched  @xcite to form the running coupling at large @xmath2 as predicted by perturbative qcd in any rs .",
    "the low @xmath17-evolution of @xmath11 is derived from the long - range confining forces : the originally constant , _",
    "i.e. _ the conformal invariant light - front holographic ( lfh ) coupling @xmath39 , is redefined to include the effects of qcd s long - range confining force .",
    "as we shall show in detail , the @xmath17 dependence of the coupling in the ir follows from the specific embedding of light - front dynamics in ads space  @xcite ; it is uniquely determined in terms of the dilaton profile originating from the specific breaking of conformal invariance consistent with the daff mechanism  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the coupling at short distances , as described by perturbative qcd , becomes @xmath17-dependent because short - distance qcd quantum effects are included in its definition .",
    "we start with the dilaton modified ads@xmath20 action : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ads metric determinant , @xmath42 the ads coupling , and the dilaton profile is given by @xmath43 .",
    "the scale @xmath31 controls quark confinement and determines the hadron masses in lf holographic qcd  @xcite .",
    "it also determines the @xmath17 dependence of the strong coupling from the large - distance confining forces , _",
    "i.e. _ the effect of the modification of the ads space curvature from nonconformal confinement dynamics  @xcite : @xmath44 the five - dimensional coupling @xmath45 is mapped , modulo a constant , to the lfh coupling @xmath46 of the confining theory in physical space - time .",
    "the holographic variable @xmath19 is identified with the physical invariant impact separation variable @xmath21  @xcite : @xmath47 we thus have @xmath48    the physical coupling measured at space - like 4-momentum squared @xmath49 is the light - front transverse fourier transform of the lfh coupling @xmath50 ( [ glfh ] ) : @xmath51 in the @xmath52 light - front frame where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a bessel function . using this ansatz we then have from eq .",

    "the ir fixed - point of @xmath61 is kinematically constrained to the value @xmath62 .",
    "however , we will ignore this constraint here since one of our goals is to determine the freezing value of @xmath37 for different rs from the matching procedure described below .",
    "an agreement with the value @xmath63 for the @xmath64-effective charge will demonstrate the consistency of the procedure .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_g1 from ads / qcd ] ) is valid only in the nonperturbative regime .",

    "<S> the qcd running coupling @xmath0 sets the strength of the interactions of quarks and gluons as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 dependence of the coupling is required to describe hadronic interactions at both large and short distances . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the light - front holographic approach to strongly - coupled qcd , a formalism which incorporates confinement , predicts the spectroscopy of hadrons composed of light quarks , and describes the low-@xmath2 analytic behavior of the strong coupling @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the high-@xmath2 dependence of the coupling @xmath0 is specified by perturbative qcd and its renormalization group equation . </S>",
    "<S> the matching of the high and low @xmath2 regimes of @xmath0 then determines the scale @xmath3 which sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative hadron dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 can be used to set the factorization scale for dglap evolution of hadronic structure functions and the erbl evolution of distribution amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the scheme - dependence of the value of @xmath3 and the infrared fixed - point of the qcd coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is carried out for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 renormalization schemes . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the discrepancies on the value of @xmath8 at large distance seen in the literature can be explained by different choices of renormalization schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide the formulae to compute @xmath0 over the entire range of space - like momentum transfer for the different renormalization schemes discussed in this article .    </S>",
