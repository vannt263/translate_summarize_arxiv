    "the term `` chaos '' was first introduced into mathematics by li and yorke @xcite . since then , various definitions of chaos have been proposed . however , in general , they do not coincide , and none of them can be considered as a perfect definition of chaos . most of the definitions are based on the feature of long - term unpredictability of chaotic behaviors due to sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "the relations between those definitions have been widely studied , as well as other measures of complexity , such as the topological entropy , conjugacy or semi - conjugacy to symbolic dynamical systems , the lyapunov exponent , the hausdorff dimension , and so on .",
    "the notion of `` coupled - expansion '' as a criterion for chaos was originated from the terminology of turbulence @xcite and was considered as an important property of one - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "specifically , a continuous map @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the unit interval , is said to be _ turbulent _ if there exist closed non degenerated subintervals @xmath3 , @xmath4 of @xmath2 with pairwise disjoint interiors such that @xmath5 .    furthermore , the map @xmath6 is said to be _ strictly turbulent _ if the subintervals @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be chosen disjoint .",
    "in fact , the same concept was studied in one - dimensional dynamical system by misiurewicz @xcite , who called this property as \" horseshoe  , since it is similar to the smale s horseshoe effect @xcite .",

    "then @xmath10 is called an _",
    "@xmath11-horseshoe _ , or simply a _ horseshoe _ if @xmath12 .    in recently years",
    ", the study of chaos in the setting of general topological dynamics has attracted wide attention . in 2006 ,",
    "shi and yu captured the essential meanings of the concept of turbulence for continuous interval maps and extended it to maps in general metric spaces @xcite , where the maps were still called turbulent .",
    "since the term turbulence is well - established in fluid mechanics , they changed the term `` turbulence  to the ' ' coupled - expansion ",
    "@xcite , which is more intuitive in reflecting the conditions that the map satisfies . in 2009 , shi , ju and chen extended the concept of `` coupled - expansion  to a more general one  ' ' @xmath0-coupled - expansion  for the transition matrix @xmath0 @xcite , which contains \" coupled - expansion  as a special case when each entry of the matrix @xmath0 equals to 1 . in these papers , several criteria of chaos induced by",
    "strictly coupled - expanding maps or @xmath0-coupled - expanding maps have been established in metric spaces , essentially with the compactness , by using the conjugacy to symbolic dynamical systems .",
    "some extended criteria of chaos based on a result in @xcite in the context of the complete metric space , can also be found in @xcite .",
    "actually , the essential ideas of these notions include `` horseshoe  and ' ' turbulence  .",
    "thus , `` coupled - expansion  and ' ' @xmath0-coupled - expansion  in metric spaces are based on domain splitting and it is inclined to use conjugacy or semi - conjugacy to symbolic dynamical systems , that is , shift or subshift of finite type .",
    "this is one of the common and useful ways to study chaos or complex behaviors .",
    "therefore , there are various other results , which are more or less similar .    in 2001 ,",
    "kennedy and york @xcite studied topological horseshoes and proved that a continuous map in a compact invariant set of a metric space could be topologically semi - conjugate to a symbolic dynamical system under some hypotheses , called the horseshoe hypotheses .",
    "particularly , in 2001 , fu and lu et al .",
    "@xcite ( definition 7.1 , theorem 7.2 ) presented the concept of \" distillation  and conditions for conjugacy to the subshift of finite type , which are akin to the results in @xcite but in the hausdorff space .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath0-coupled - expanding property has been regarded as an important criterion for chaos .",
    "in addition , the positive topological entropy , which measures the complexity of a system , is also known as one of the main indices to characterize chaos .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider the topological entropy for @xmath0-coupled - expanding maps and the relationships between various concepts of chaos . as to this topic ,",
    "the topological entropy for a @xmath13-horseshoe map ( that is , a @xmath13-coupled expanding map ) on the interval was considered in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous map from a circle into itself to have a positive topological entropy was presented , and it was proved that the circle map is chaotic in the sense of devaney if and only if its topological entropy is positive .    in this paper , the topological entropy of @xmath0-coupled - expanding maps on compact metric spaces is studied .",
    "the lower bound of the topological entropy for strictly @xmath0-coupled - expanding maps on compact metric spaces is obtained and a less conservative and more generalized criterion for chaos in the sense of li - yorke is further presented .",
    "a new concept , the partition-@xmath0-coupled - expanding map , is defined excluding the usual strictness condition , and its topological entropy is estimated .",
    "particularly , the topological entropy for the partition-@xmath0-coupled - expanding circle map is given .",
    "as an illustrative example , the topological entropy for the kasner map is calculated , which is one of the most important tools in the research on cosmological models of bianchi type in the big - bang singular limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ pre ] , some basic concepts and lemmas are briefly introduced . in section [ entropy ] , the topological entropy for the strictly @xmath0-coupled - expanding maps on compact metric spaces",
    "is discussed and a criterion for chaos in the sense of li - yorke which is less conservative and more generalized than the result of @xcite is presented . in section [ topentropy ] , some conditions for @xmath0-coupled - expanding maps to be a factor of subshifts of finite type and the topological entropy for @xmath0-coupled - expanding circle maps excluding the strictness condition are discussed .",
