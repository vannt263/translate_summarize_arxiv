    "now , we came to know that the phase coherence property and the macroscopic tunnelling are so closely related that such a system was found to exhibit quite rich physics . on the other hand , motivated by the superfluidity of the dilute bose gas , much work are focused on the rotating bec recently @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the macroscopic quantum tunnelling in the rotating bec in various parameter ranges and in both static and dynamic cases with the help of the mean field approach , and the phase coherence property in this system will be emphasized .    in section  [ sec:2 ] , a general description of our system and the hamiltonian to begin with",

    "fluctuations of the phase and the particle number of the ground state are given in section  [ sec:4 ] and it follows that the condition of the josephson effect in this case is satisfied . in section",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we consider the case where the rotating frequency varies with time , and the nonlinear landau - zener tunnelling @xcite is realized in this system .",
    "finally , some conclusions and further discussion are given in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "we consider the bose - einstein condensate with total particle number @xmath0 which is trapped in a circularly symmetrical trap @xmath1 or container , and rotated by an asymmetric perturbation @xmath2 .",

    "consider a two - level system , its adiabatic eigenenergies @xmath98 and @xmath99 increases and decreases linearly with time @xmath100 respectively , crossing at a certain value of @xmath101 .",
    "taking account of the coupling energy @xmath49 between the two levels , the adiabatic eigenvalues of such a system @xmath102 and @xmath103 with wavefunctions @xmath104 and @xmath105 avoid crossing .",
    "we know from the adiabatic theorem that if the system with coupling is initially in the state @xmath106 and @xmath100 changes infinitely slowly from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , then the system will remain in the state @xmath109 .",
    "however , if @xmath100 changes with a finite velocity , the final state of the system will be a linear combination of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this means when the two eigenenergies are getting close to each other , the system will undergo an instanton - like tunnelling , which is well known as landau - zener tunnelling @xcite and can be realized in a lot of systems in molecular and atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of the landau - zener tunnelling can be generalized to the many - body mean - field problem with non - linear interactions @xcite , in which the tunnelling can take place even in the adiabatic case .    in the two previous sections we study the case where the angular frequency @xmath8 is fixed while it can be dependent of time in real life .",

    "in summary , we have studied the macroscopic phenomena in rotating bec by using the su(2 ) coherent state path - integral method .",
    "our discussion can also be extended to the rotating bec with attractive interactions and bec in an optical lattice . in the latter case",
    ", we can expand the field operator in terms of single - particle ground state wave functions localized in each well , then the coupling energy @xmath49 is replaced by the hopping energy , which depends on the overlap of the local wave functions . some detailed calculation can be found in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we can see that when @xmath49 is sufficiently small , the phase fluctuation will be very large , @xmath134 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : four ] ) , the system is in a fock region .",
    "it can be easily understood physically in the rotating case that when the coupling energy is absent , the tunnelling is forbidden by the angular momentum conservation law and the relative number fluctuation is suppressed . in an optical lattice , small @xmath49 means sufficiently high barrier which also prohibits the tunnelling .",
    "when @xmath49 is comparable to the self - interaction energy , the system is in the josephson region as we have shown in section iv .",
    "thus , continuously decreasing @xmath49 will lead the system to undergo a phase - diffusion process and there is a crossover from the josephson to fock region as exhibited experimentally recently in ref .",
    "the physics of such experiments can be understood clearly and quantitatively in our su(2 ) coherent state frame .",
