    "<S> the magnetoresistance ( mr ) in our samples is attributed to the magnetic field dependence of the discrete energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence has been studied in refs . where the magnetic anisotropy energy was found to have a significant contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed such dependence of the levels in our sample at dilution refrigerator temperatures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the levels on the applied magnetic field leads to mr at low temperature where the levels are well resolved . at @xmath0k , </S>",
    "<S> energy levels broaden but some mr still remains@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the field dependence of the levels due to the magnetic anisotropy , magneto - coulomb effect@xcite may also contribute to the mr in our devices . </S>",
    "<S> so , the transition from low(high ) current to high(low ) current state during the sweep of magnetic field suggests magnetization reversal in co nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the magnetic transitions in fig . </S>",

    "<S> reductions in switching field of the magnetic transitions are observed when the spacing is below @xmath1s , suggesting microwave triggered switch @xcite ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> similarly , the decrease in the switching field of the transition indicated by star when @xmath41s is larger than that at @xmath35k . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that magnetic excitations in co nanoparticles are pumped directly by microwave pulses , not by ordinary sample heating . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of switching field is still observable at @xmath1s pulse spacing , which implies that the magnetic energy delivered by a single pulse does not completely dissipate in @xmath1s . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the spin relaxation time in our co nanoparticles is in the order of microsecond . </S>",
    "<S> long lower bounds of the spin - relaxation time @xmath42 in co nanoparticles have been observed before.@xcite the work in this letter narrows down @xmath42 at 4.2k to the microsecond range .    </S>",
    "<S> we can use the i - v curve to estimate the magnetic field at the nanoparticle due to the rf current . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening of the i - v curve by the microwave pulses becomes visible in our measurement when the spacing between pulses is @xmath21s ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also induce broadening of the i - v curve by injection of a continuous ac current at frequency @xmath43khz , instead of microwave pulses ( after shorting the capacitors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the ac current @xmath44 can easily be determined using a standard lock - in technique . </S>",
    "<S> we use a low frequency transformer to isolate the ac circuit . </S>",
    "<S> then we measure the i - v curve at different ac current . by matching the i - v curve at different @xmath19 and @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> , we can find the power of microwave pulses with certain @xmath19 from the amplitude of corresponding @xmath44 . based on this result </S>",
    "<S> , we can solve the equations , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the current density of frequency and @xmath49 is the power of a single pulse . under the assumption that @xmath50 is gaussian distributed according to the fourier spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the expression for microwave induced current @xmath51 in time domain after fourier transform of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can find the amplitude of @xmath51 by plugging this expression into the second equation . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the rf - field on the nanoparticle is estimated to be @xmath52 t from the lead geometry and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> if a white noise instead of microwave pulses is coupled to the sample , the damping parameter of co nanoparticles could be estimated by corresponding the applied random magnetic field with the one obtained from magnetic thermal noise@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this will be the subject of future work .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the hysteresis loops of co nanoparticles in presence of nanosecond microwave pulses by electron tunneling and demonstrate that microwave pulses can pump magnetic excitations in these nanoparticles directly , without heating the leads . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic switching field is reduced by repeated pulses with spacing @xmath53s , suggesting that magnetization relaxation time is in the range of microsecond . </S>",
