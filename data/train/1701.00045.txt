    "these coherences can originate in principle from both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",

    "the intra - pigment vibrations of the light - harvesting systems exhibit underdamped vibrational motions on a picosecond timescale , which can leads to vibrational coherences in the electronic ground state manifold  @xcite .",
    "a vibronic ( electronic - vibrational ) coupling between electronic states and underdamped vibrational motions leads to a mixing of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom , inducing vibronic coherences in the electronic excited state manifold  @xcite .",

    "coherent vibronic coupling has been shown to induce long - lived vibronic coherences when the vibrational frequency is resonant with the energy - level difference between exciton states  @xcite and the vibronic coupling strength is moderate in magnitude  @xcite . in this case , oscillatory 2d signals originate from the combination of excited - state vibronic coherence and ground - state vibrational coherence , as they originate from the same mechanism , namely the vibronic hamiltonian .",
    "recent 2d experiments on j - aggregates of cyanine dyes @xcite confirmed the validity of this theoretical approach .",
    "other experimental results on a synthetic dimer @xcite pointed towards the need of a threshold in the vibronic coupling strength to allow vibronic mixing to be relevant under environmental effects .",
    "correlated fluctuations in the transition energies of neighboring pigments have been suggested as an alternative mechanism where purely electronic coherences in the excited state manifold induce long - lived oscillatory 2d signals  @xcite . in the correlated fluctuation model , where underdamped vibrational motions are not considered , uncorrelated noise between electronic ground and excited states leads to the finite homogeneous broadening of 2d spectra , while highly correlated noise between different excited states induces long - lived inter - excitonic coherences .",
    "this purely electronic coherence model is similar in spirit to the decoherence - free subspaces in quantum information science  @xcite .",

    "it was found that uncorrelated and correlated fluctuation models give very similar absorption spectra and rephasing diagonal - peaks , but show large differences in rephasing cross - peak regimes  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the lifetime of 2d oscillations was observed for rephasing diagonal- and cross - peaks , but the diagonal - peak oscillations were attributed to the overlap of non - oscillatory diagonal - peaks with nearby oscillating cross - peaks  @xcite .",
    "it was found that correlations in the noise can alter the relative phase between diagonal- and cross - peak oscillations  @xcite .",
    "correlations in inhomogeneous broadening have also been considered in the context of 2des where correlated and anti - correlated static disorder lead to cross - peaks strongly elongated along diagonal and anti - diagonal directions , respectively  @xcite .",
    "a similar feature was observed in the simulations of 2d infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy in the slow bath limit , while different correlation models lead to similar lorentzian 2d lineshapes in the fast bath limit  @xcite .",

    "this is contrary to the 2d experiments on the fmo complex @xcite , colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets @xcite and j - aggregates of porphyrins  @xcite , where the presence of correlated fluctuations was suggested .",
    "the discrepancy between theory and experiment shows the need for further investigations of how the degree of correlations in the noise is reflected in experimental observables , so that the presence of correlated fluctuations can be verified or ruled out based upon experimental results .",
    "in this work , we employ the bloch - redfield equation  @xcite where the degree of correlations in the noise is parameterized by a continuous variable to investigate how the correlations affect the oscillatory features in rephasing and non - rephasing 2d spectra of a model dimer system . we do not include underdamped vibrational modes in the model to focus on the influence of spatial noise correlations on optical responses without vibronic effects .",
