    "the study of correlations in quantum systems has a vast literature and draws its practical importance from potential applications to quantum technologies such as quantum cryptography and teleportation @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a move towards extending these studies to systems in the domain of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "neutrino is a particularly interesting candidate for such a study . in nature , neutrinos are available in three flavors , viz , the electron - neutrino @xmath0 , muon - neutrino @xmath1 and tau - neutrino @xmath2 . owing to their non - zero mass , they oscillate from one flavor to another .",
    "this has been confirmed by a plethora of experiments , using both natural and `` man - made '' neutrinos .",
    "neutrino oscillations are fundamentally three flavor oscillations .",
    "however , in some cases , it can be reduced to effective two flavor oscillations  @xcite .",
    "these elementary particles interact only via weak interactions , consequently the effect of decoherence , as compared to other particles widely utilized for quantum information processing , is small .",
    "numerous experiments have revealed interesting details of the physics of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "this paper asks what type of quantum correlations is persistent in the time evolution of an initial @xmath0 or @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "it presents a systematic study of the many - faceted aspect of quantum correlations .",
    "herewith , it contributes to the understanding how nature processes quantum information in the regime of elementary particles and , in particular , which aspect of quantum information is relevant in weak interaction processes .",
    "three - flavor neutrino oscillations can be studied by mapping the state of the neutrino , treating it as a three - mode system , to that of a three - qubit system  @xcite . in particular , it was shown that the neutrino oscillations are related to the multi - mode entanglement of single - particle states which can be expressed in terms of flavor transition probabilities . here",
    "we take the study of such foundational issues further by characterizing three - flavor neutrino oscillations by quantum correlations .",
    "this is non - trivial as quantum correlations in three - qubit systems are much more involved compared to their two - qubit counterparts .",
    "the present study of quantum correlations in three flavor neutrino oscillations can be broadly classified into three categories :    * entanglement : we study various types of the in - separability properties of the dynamics of neutrino oscillations via the von neumann entropy and in terms of a nonlinear witness of _ genuine _ multipartite entanglement introduced in ref .  @xcite . * _ genuine _ multipartite nonlocality : nonlocality  that is considered to be the strongest manifestation of quantum correlations  is studied in both its absolute and genuine tripartite facets , characterized by the mermin inequalities  @xcite and svetlichny inequalities  @xcite . *",
    "dissension : a tripartite generalization of quantum discord which is a measure of nonclassicality of correlations  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , we provide a brief introduction to the phenomenology of neutrinos and introduce the three - flavour mode entangled state which will be analysed using information theoretic tools .",
    "the core of the paper is sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , where we characterize three flavor neutrino oscillations in terms of various facets of quantum correlations .",
    "we then conclude by providing an outlook .",
    "the three flavours of neutrinos , @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , mix to form three mass eigenstates @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 pmns ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ) mixing matrix parameterized by three mixing angles ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and a @xmath14 violating phase @xmath15 ( @xmath16  charge conjugation , @xmath17  parity ) . neglecting the @xmath14 violating phase ( that has not been observed ) the mixing matrix can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "therefore , each flavor state is given by a linear superposition of the mass eigenstates , @xmath23 where @xmath24 ; @xmath25 .",
    "as the massive neutrino states @xmath26 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian with energy eigenvalues @xmath27 , the time evolution of the mass eigenstates @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath28 are the mass eigenstates at time @xmath30 .",
    "straightforwardly , the time evolution of flavor neutrino states computes to @xmath31 with @xmath32    for example , if an electron - neutrino is produced at time @xmath30 then its time evolution is given by    @xmath33    where @xmath34    if we assume that the detected neutrinos have an energy of at least one mev ( the electron / positron mass ) , namely are in the ultrarelativistic regime , the flavor eigenstates are well defined in the context of quantum mechanics  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the survival probabilities take the form @xmath35 and the oscillation probabilities @xmath36    where @xmath37 . as in the neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "the known quantity is the distance @xmath38 between the source and the detector and not the propagation time @xmath39 , therefore the propagation time @xmath39 is replaced by the source and detector distance @xmath38 in the above equation .",
    "this is a valid approximation as all detected neutrinos in the oscillation experiments are ultrarelativistic .",
    "the allowed ranges of the six oscillation parameters , three mixing angles and three mass squared differences , is obtained by a global fit to solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino data within the framework of three flavor neutrino oscillations . for normal",
    "ordering , the best fit values of three flavor oscillation parameters are @xcite @xmath40 @xmath41    following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce the occupation number of neutrinos by making the following correspondence : @xmath42 consequently , we can view the time evolution of a flavor eigenstate @xmath43 as a three - qubit state , i.e. , @xmath44 therefore , flavor oscillations can be related to time variation of the tripartite entanglement of single particle states .",

    "the separability problem is in general a np - hard problem , and only necessary but not generally sufficient criteria exists to detect entanglement . for bipartite",
    "entangled quantum systems it suffices to ask whether the state is entangled or not . in the multi - partite case",
    "the problem is more involved since there exist different hierarchies of separability ( defined later ) .",
    "we have defined the algebra by introducing the occupation number of the three flavours and our first goal is to understand the time evolution of neutrino oscillation in terms of tools for classifying and detecting different types of entanglement .",
    "the next step would be to take potential measurement settings into account and analyse the different facets of correlations in the dynamic of neutrinos .",
    "in particular , we are interested whether there are correlations stronger than those predicted by any classical theory . the correlations are studied via two different approaches , one based on the dichotomy between predictions of quantum theory and different hidden parameter theories , and the other one quantifies the various information contents via entropies .",
    "entanglement measures quantify how much a quantum state @xmath49 fails to be separable .",
    "axiomatically , it must be a nonnegative real function of a state which can not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , and is zero for separable states .",
    "an entropic function generally quantifies the average information gain by learning about the outcome obtained by measuring a system .",
    "the von neumann entropy , a quantum mechanical analogue of shannon entropy , is defined by @xmath50 and is zero for pure states and @xmath51 for the totally mixed state , where @xmath52 is system dimension , and the log function usually refers to base 2 .",
    "the entanglement content can be computed by the entropy of the subsystems since the full system is pure .",
    "considering the three possible partial traces of the three - qubit state under investigation , we obtain a concave function of the single - mode probabilities @xmath53 , i.e. , with @xmath54 @xmath55 which we call the flavor entropy .",
    "this function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] together with the survival probabilities @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ surviveprob ] ) , and the oscillation probabilities @xmath57 , eq .",
    "( [ oscprob ] ) .",
    "since the flavor entropy @xmath58 is nonzero for almost all time instances , the state is entangled . for this and all the following plots , we use as units , the oscillation period of an electron to a muon - neutrino .",
    "since there are tiny changes in the behaviour in one period due to the existence of the third flavour , we always plot two periods .",
    "when the amount of all three probabilities , both the survival as well as the oscillation probabilities , become nearly equal , the flavour entropy becomes maximal .",
    "then the @xmath1 and @xmath2 oscillation probabilities become greater than the survival probability of @xmath0 resulting in a decrease in the uncertainty of the total state followed by an increase , when the probabilities get closer .",
    "next , the uncertainty in the total state drops again and the pattern gets repeated .",
    "the entropy of all the three possible flavour entropies are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : entanglemententropy ] showing that for the muon- and tau - neutrinos the entropy is non - zero for almost all time instances .",
    "compared to the electron - neutrino evolution , the flavor uncertainty of the other two flavours oscillates more rapidly and with higher amplitudes , reaching the maximal value more often .",
    "let us now refine the picture by investigating the type of entanglement in neutrino oscillations .",
    "a tripartite pure state can be , for example written as @xmath59 gives the number of partitions dubbed the @xmath60-separability .",
    "if @xmath60 equals the number of involved states , in our case @xmath61 , the joint state is called fully separable , else it is partially separable . an important class of states are those that are not separable within any bi - partition , and are called _ genuinely multi - partite entangled_. in general they allow for applications that outperform their classical counterparts , such as secret sharing @xcite . it should be noted that since a @xmath61-separable state is necessarily also @xmath62-separable , @xmath60-separable states have a nested - convex structure",
    ".    among the genuinely multi - partite entangled states , there are two subclasses known for three qubit states , the ghz- and w - type of states . in ref .",
    "@xcite a general framework was introduced to detect and define different relevant multipartite entanglement subclasses and refined in several follow ups . in particular",
    "it has been shown to allow for a self - consistent classification also in a relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "generally , one would expect from a proper classification of different types of entanglement that for a relativistically boosted observer , which causes a change of the observed state , but not of the expectation value , that it remains in a certain entanglement class .",
    "we will therefore investigate this lorentz invariant criterion , though let us emphasise that we do not take any relativistic effects of a boosted observer into account in this contribution .",
    "the necessary criterion for a tripartite qubit state with one excitation ( `` @xmath63 '' ) to be bipartite reads    @xmath64    if this criterion is violated the state @xmath49 has no bipartite decompositions , i.e. , it is genuinely multipartite entangled .",
    "the positive terms are exactly the only non - zero off - diagonal terms of the @xmath65-state , @xmath66 , with one excitation in the computational basis , whereas the negative terms are only diagonal terms .",
    "note that these negative terms are all zero for the @xmath65-state in the given basis such that only this state obtains the maximum value .",
    "obviously , this criterion depends on the basis representation of the state @xmath49 and has therefore to be optimized over all local unitary operations . indeed , taking the `` flavour basis '' as the computational basis , eq .  ( [ wstate ] )",
    ", the unoptimized criterion becomes @xmath67 which is not violated for all times .",
    "consequently , optimization over all local unitaries has to be taken into account for each time point and is plotted for an initial electron- , muon- and tau - neutrino in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmopt ] .",
    "we find that the states at each time point are always genuine multipartite entangled if at least two amplitudes of the state , eq .",
    "( [ wstate ] ) , are non - zero , i.e. , for almost all time instances . the results depicted in fig .  [ fig : qmopt ] also prove that in the course of the time evolution the genuine multipartite @xmath65 state ( all amplitudes equal to @xmath68 ) is reached . hence , nature exploits the maximum genuine multipartite entanglement in the occupation number basis .",
    "we now ask the question whether in the course of the flavor oscillations , bell - type nonlocality is persistent , i.e. , there are correlations stronger than those predicted by any classical hidden variable theory . for",
    "that we investigate the svetlichny inequalities  @xcite which are a sufficient criteria for proving _ genuine _ tripartite nonlocality . in short ,",
    "the idea is whether by measuring three observables @xmath69 and obtaining the results @xmath70 , the probability @xmath71 can be assumed to be factorizable as @xmath72 where @xmath73 are probabilities conditioned to the hidden variable @xmath74 with the probability measure @xmath75 .",
    "the factorization , here chosen between the partitions @xmath76 versus @xmath16 , corresponds to bell s locality assumption in his original derivation if considered for two systems .",
    "( the requirement of a full factorization , i.e. , the additional factorization @xmath77 , which correspond to absolute locality , is explored later by the inequalities  ( [ eq : mermin ] ) ) .",
    "then the necessary criteria for such a factorization of the conditioned probabilities , qubit @xmath63 and @xmath78 versus @xmath79 , are given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "since we are not interested in a particular hidden parameter model , we also consider the two other bipartitions , namely @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and take the maximum over them . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sopt ] we have plotted the maximum of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , over all bipartitions , for the time evolution of an initial electron- , muon- and tau - neutrino . in addition , each data point corresponds to the maximum of the optimization over all possible observables @xmath69 . in the case of an initial electron - neutrino",
    "we find regions in the time evolution when the criterion does not detect genuine tripartite nonlocality , whereas for the two other neutrino flavours we observe a stronger oscillating behaviour .",
    "summing up , whereas genuine nonlocal correlation is largely present in the time evolution , there are specific time regions when it vanishes .    requiring",
    "that for all three measurements a hidden parameter model should exist can be revealed by the following set of inequalities  @xcite @xmath87 which are connected to the svetlichny inequality by @xmath88 ( see refs .",
    "these are the mermin inequalities and their violation is an indicator of absolute nonlocality .",
    "again we are interested in finding a contradiction to any hidden parameter model , thus we consider all bipartitions and take the maximum .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mermin ] ( including an optimization over all four arbitrary operators @xmath89 ) .",
    "for all times ( except when the state is separable ) the two inequalities are violated when optimized over all measurement settings .",
    "this shows that assuming that the mode correlations can be simulated by an ensemble where all three subsystems are correlated to each other for all time instances is not possible .",
    "in contrast , correlations simulated by a hybrid nonlocal - local ensemble , captured by inequalities  ( [ svetlichnycrit ] ) , may exist for time instances close to the separable state , however , only for the electron - neutrino dynamics .    to sum up , except for small time regions neutrino oscillations exhibit all the strong correlations , entanglement and bell - type nonlocality , that are considered to give an advantage to quantum theory over classical theories for a number of information processing tasks . for completeness ,",
    "in the next section we investigate the behavior of a measure of nonclassicality weaker than entanglement .",

    "mutual information can be generalized for three random variables @xmath69 by any of the following three equivalent expressions  @xcite    @xmath98    while the second of these expressions suggests a straightforward quantum generalization , by replacing the shannon entropy by the corresponding von neumann entropy @xmath99 , the first and third expressions lead to complications since the average conditioned entropy depends on the basis chosen and on the choice of the random variables @xmath69 .",
    "let us point out that in strong contrast to the bipartite mutual information the tripartite mutual information may also be negative .",
    "this is the case if for instance knowing the random variable @xmath16 enhances the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 . following the concept of quantum discord @xcite , which quantifies nonclassical correlations , in ref .",

    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 deviations from zero can be associated to nonclassicality accessed by only one - mode or two - mode measurements , respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath111 is always zero , since @xmath112 is zero because the total state is pure and since @xmath113 , this being a particularity of the @xmath65 class of states .",
    "furthermore , any permutation of the entropy @xmath114 is zero , since any projection onto the two - mode subspace gives a pure state which has zero uncertainty .",

    "[ fig : dissension ] we plot the dissensions @xmath116 minimized over all projective measurements for the time evolution of an initial electron - neutrino .",
    "the first notable point is that both measures are very sensitive to whether the nonclassicality is accessed by single or bipartite measurements and both measures are non - zero for almost all times .",
    "interestingly , we find that for both measures @xmath117 and all measurement types there are time regions for which the value exceeds the corresponding value for the @xmath65-state , which has @xmath118 . for single measurements dissension @xmath108 is still considerably smaller than the values for the ghz state ( @xmath119 ) , in contrast to @xmath109 where @xmath120 . moreover , a strong `` twin - humped '' pattern of @xmath109 in the time evolution is found for joint measurements in the subspace of the two heavier neutrinos showing the existence of the third neutrino flavour ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "to sum up , we have computed several information theoretic quantities detecting and classifying correlations for the time evolution of an initial electron- , muon- or tau - neutrino .",
    "we find that for almost all time instances the neutrino states exhibit genuine quantum features .",
    "we have analysed in detail the dynamics of initial neutrino states via various types of entanglement properties , correlations that can not be simulated by realistic hidden variable theories and non - classical correlations revealed by mutual information measures . in particular , dissension turned out to be larger than that for the perfect @xmath65-state ( dicke state ) , for some time values , in strong contrast to the measures not involving measurements , i.e. , the flavor entropy and the criterion detecting genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "what physical significance this carries , if any , remains to be seen .",
    "qualitatively , there are differences between an initial electron - neutrino and the other two neutrinos , i.e. , with the former showing less nonclassical features when compared to its heavier counterparts , a point that may merit further scrutiny . in any case , we can conclude that foundational issues are more prominent in accelerator experiments ( mainly producing muon - neutrinos ) than in reactor experiments ( mainly producing electron - neutrinos ) .",
    "the weak force , being one of the four known fundamental forces in nature , dominant in the flavour changing process of neutrinos , reveals strong genuine quantum features such as also shown for weakly decaying spinless @xmath122-mesons  @xcite or for the weakly decaying half integer spin hyperons  @xcite",
