    "nowadays , the importance of the _ ising model _ in the theory of statistical mechanics can be hardly exaggerated  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , early results proved the absence of spontaneous magnetization in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model and pointed to the lack of phase transitions also in higher dimensions  @xcite , thus stimulating the appearance of other models to explain ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "the arguments against the existence of phase transitions in higher dimensions were proven wrong by subsequent efforts  @xcite , such as the exact solution of the ising model on a 2d square lattice  @xcite , and eventually turned the ising model into a paradigm of critical phenomena .",
    "moreover , the relevance of the ising model goes far beyond the theory of thermal phase transitions .",
    "for instance , the partition function of the square - lattice ising model , and thus its critical phenomena , can be related to the ground state of the 1d ising model subjected to a transverse magnetic field that plays the role of the temperature  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a new kind of critical effects , i.e. quantum phase transitions  @xcite , where the ground state of a system changes abruptly as a microscopic parameter controlling the quantum fluctuations is varied .",
    "thanks to its exact solution  @xcite , this _ quantum ising model _ also plays a pivotal role in the theory of quantum criticality  @xcite and , despite its apparent over - simplified appearance , has turned out to be a faithful representation of certain magnetic materials  @xcite .",
    "the ising model also occupies a privileged position in the theory of emergence in many - body systems  @xcite . in certain geometries , such as the triangular lattice  @xcite ,",
    "antiferromagnetic ising interactions can not be simultaneously minimized , an effect known as _ frustration_. in the 3d pyrochlore lattice , this magnetic frustration resembles the ordering of protons in water ice  @xcite , and inhibits the development of magnetic order even at very low temperatures .",
    "this leads to exotic emergent effects  @xcite that can be measured in these so - called spin - ice materials  @xcite , constituting a hallmark in the physics of spin liquids .",
    "moreover , if quantum fluctuations are introduced , the wisdom is that even more exotic properties survive at zero temperatures , leading to the elusive quantum spin liquids  @xcite .",
    "from this perspective , it is thus important to understand the interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations in the ising model . the standard approach to introduce quantum fluctuations on",
    "the vastly degenerate ising ground state considers additional heisenberg exchange couplings of tunable strength , which flip pairs of spins and lead to the so - called xxz model  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the unique possibility .",
    "for instance , one may introduce quantum fluctuations by a transverse field leading to _ frustrated quantum ising models _ , which can also host quantum spin liquids in certain lattices  @xcite .",
    "as a starting point towards this goal , envisaged in this paper , it is useful to identify setups where the physics of simpler frustrated quantum ising models can be explored experimentally .",
    "in addition to frustration , interesting many - body effects may also arise as one departs from the standard scenario of pair - wise interactions , and considers multi - particle couplings .",
    "for instance , the partition function of a spin - ice ising model that combines 2- and 4-body interactions in a square lattice  @xcite can be mapped onto the so - called eight - vertex model  @xcite , which is a paradigm for critical phenomena in ice - type models .",
    "in contrast to the standard ising model with pairwise interactions  @xcite , this _ ising model with multi - spin interactions _ presents some rather exotic properties , e.g. critical exponents vary continuously with the strength of the 4-body interactions , thus connecting different universality classes .",
    "in addition to this example , we note that even more exotic phenomena occur when _ ( i ) _ quantum fluctuations or / and _ ( ii ) _ higher dimensions are also considered : _ ( i ) _ the combination of 4-body ising interactions with a transverse field in the square lattice can lead to phases with topological order  @xcite . _",
    "( ii ) _ ising models on the cubic lattice with 4-body interactions possess a local gauge symmetry that forbids the use of the standard local order parameters  @xcite .",
    "by introducing quantum fluctuations through a transverse field , such models yield a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ising gauge theory  @xcite through the euclidean generalization of the quantum - classical mapping  @xcite .    from this perspective",
    ", it is important to understand the interplay of multi - spin interactions with quantum fluctuations , and its role in the emergence of exotic quantum magnets .",
    "a useful tool to reach this goal , again envisaged in this paper , would be an experimental setup where simple quantum ising models with multi - spin interactions can be implemented .",
    "* scheme of a trapped - ion dual quantum simulator : * the combination of phonon - mediated spin - spin interactions in linear ion chains with the ability to measure highly non - local operators would allow to exploit a quantum duality transformation to explore exotic ising models with tunable frustration or multi - spin interactions that can be defined in two - leg ladders with triangular motifs . ]    in this manuscript , we argue that current experiments of trapped - ion crystals can address the before - mentioned goals : we explicitly demonstrate that relevant instances of frustrated quantum ising models , as well as exotic quantum ising magnets with multi - spin interactions , can be implemented in such systems . for our proposal ,",
    "we exploit a theoretical concept known as _ quantum dualities _  @xcite , which provides a mapping between different spin models . broadly speaking , a dual map replaces the spin operators at the sites ( vertices ) of a lattice by analog operators acting on the bonds ( links ) _ between _ the vertices .",
    "accordingly , duality can be used as a tool to switch between local and non - local models , which , as shown in this paper , facilitates the implementation of some hamiltonians of interest in a trapped - ion setup ( see fig .  [ scheme_duality ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qs_ions ] , we describe two possible strategies to simulate the required spin hamiltonian in linear chains of trapped ions . in sec .",

    "the ever - improving experimental control of certain quantum systems , especially in the realm of atomic , molecular , and optical physics , has reached such a level that it is now possible to devise systems that will behave according to specific quantum many - body models  @xcite .",
    "this synthetic quantum matter , usually known as a _ quantum simulator _ , provides an alternative route to address longstanding problems in condensed - matter physics , such as the interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations mentioned above . among the different experimental platforms available nowadays , small crystals of atomic ions confined by electromagnetic traps",
    "@xcite have already proven to be quite flexible quantum simulators  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the possibilities of trapped - ion quantum simulators in the context of frustrated and multi - spin quantum ising models .",
    "following the seminal proposal to use the phonons of the ion crystal as mediators of spin - spin interactions  @xcite ( for earlier related proposals see @xcite ) , small - scale 1d quantum ising magnets have been experimentally realized  @xcite . the most direct approaches to include frustration would require engineering 2d ion lattices with triangular motifs , either by considering penning traps  @xcite and micro - fabricated trap arrays in a surface electrode  @xcite , or by coping with the excess micro - motion associated with 2d lattices in common rf - traps  @xcite",
    ". a different approach , which has proven very fruitful  @xcite , retains the 1d geometry of the crystals in linear paul traps while exploiting the long - range character of the ising interactions to induce frustration via next - to - nearest - neighbor couplings . in this work",
    ", we shall introduce an alternative method that also permits retaining the 1d lattices , but offers more flexibility by allowing full control of the range of frustration in the simulated spin models .    regarding multi - spin interactions ,",
    "there have been proposals  @xcite that generalize the above schemes  @xcite by considering non - linear spin - phonon couplings that can induce 2- and 3-body ising interactions at the expense of getting weaker spin - spin couplings with respect to the pair - wise scenario .",
    "hence , synthesizing other multi - spin interactions , such as the mentioned 4-body ising couplings , will result in even weaker coupling strengths that question the possibility of an experimental observation .",
    "a different and very fruitful approach is to build stroboscopic quantum simulators by concatenating well - controlled unitaries  @xcite . for the particular unitaries available in trapped - ion setups ,",
    "multi - spin interactions can be obtained by introducing simple sequences that involve auxiliary spins  @xcite , as demonstrated in the experiments  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we propose an alternative method to implement 4-body interactions in an analog fashion , thus not limited by the accumulated error of the concatenated unitaries , but without the above - mentioned limitation on the coupling strengths .",
    "the central idea of this work is to exploit the concept of quantum duality  @xcite to reach the desired quantum simulator of exotic ising models with frustration , or multi - spin interactions , starting from a different hamiltonian that is easier to realize in a certain setup . in particular",
    ", we will focus on the following physical hamiltonian [ dipolar_longitudinal_xy ] h_xy=_i < j(j_ij^x_i^x_j^x+j_ij^y_i^y_j^y)-_ih_i^x , which shall be referred to as the _ longitudinal xy model _ ( @xmath0xy ) , and is the one to be implemented in the ion - trap setup .",
    "let us remark on the two unique features that make this synthetic magnet very different from real magnetic materials : _",
    "( i ) _ the exact number of spins can be experimentally controlled , _ ( ii ) _ the magnetization , or any other correlation function , can be measured locally .",
    "these two features , in combination with the quantum duality , will be crucial for the quantum simulation scheme hereby proposed .",
    "let us now describe the required ingredients to realize the above hamiltonian  , and postpone the duality connection to the desired ising models to the following sections .",
    "we start by describing the standard approach in sec .",
    "[ two_forces ] , and then introduce an alternative that might be advantageous in sec .  [ driving ] .",
    "we consider a collection of laser - cooled atomic ions confined by a linear paul trap , and forming a 1d coulomb crystal with equilibrium positions @xmath1 for @xmath2  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme_duality ] ) .",
    "the small vibrations around these equilibrium positions can be described in terms of three phonon branches , two radial @xmath3 and one longitudinal @xmath4 , namely [ eq : ho_phonons ] h_p=_n,_n , a_n,^a_n,^ , where we have introduced the bosonic operators @xmath5 that create - annihilate a phonon associated to the normal - mode frequency @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "the spin chain is formed by a pair of long - lived electronic levels from the energy - level structure of each particular ion , denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to a trivial spin hamiltonian [ eq : ho_spins ] h_s=_i_i^z , where we have introduced the transition frequency @xmath9 , and the pauli spin operator @xmath10 .",
    "these spins can be coupled by phonon - mediated interactions , which require a particular form of spin - phonon coupling .",
    "one typically considers the so - called spin - dependent dipole forces , which follow from a moving optical lattice , and read as follows [ spin_dep_forces ] h_sp=_i , n _ ,",
    "f_i , n^,r_n,_i^a_n,^e^i_n,,t+h.c . , where we work in the interaction picture with respect to eqs .  - , and",
    "have neglected rapidly oscillating terms within a rotating wave approximation . here",
    ", we have introduced the two remaining pauli spin operators @xmath11 @xmath12 the zero - point motion of the different vibrational modes @xmath13 , the dipole light forces @xmath14 , and their corresponding detunings @xmath15 .",
    "we shall assume that a particular light force will only couple to a single vibrational axis , namely @xmath16 .",
    "if the trap frequencies are different @xmath17 , such that their differences are much bigger than the far - detuned dipole forces @xmath18  @xcite , the phonons act as mere carriers of spin - spin interactions [ eff_ham ] h_eff=_i < j(j_ij^x_i^x_j^x+j_ij^y_i^y_j^y+j_ij^z_i^z_j^z ) , where the phonon - mediated spin - spin couplings [ couplings ] j_ij^=-_n+c.c . , have the standard second - order scaling @xmath19 , and thus correspond to virtual processes where a phonon is created and subsequently absorbed by a pair of distant spins in the chain .",
    "we are interested in anisotropic xy models  , and thus shall only consider dipole forces that couple to the two radial branches @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , such that the effective hamiltonian   only contains xx and yy couplings .",
    "in addition , we shall consider a so - called longitudinal field @xmath22 , which can be implemented by considering the standard carrier transitions  @xcite with the correct phase .",
    "the combination of these ingredients yields the desired @xmath0xy model of eq .   with the corresponding spin - spin couplings in eq .",
    "as announced above , we shall not exploit the long - range nature of such couplings to engineer frustration  @xcite .",
    "instead , we will consider the largest possible detunings , which lead to the smallest possible errors in the quantum simulation  @xcite , and also yield a fast - decaying dipolar tail of the anti - ferromagnetic spin - spin interactions [ dip_decay ] j_ij^ , j_0^>0,\\{x , y}. we thus obtain a dipolar version of the famous xy model  @xcite , subjected to an additional longitudinal field .",
    "let us note that , so far , there has not been any experimental realization of a spin model exploiting simultaneously two phonon branches of a trapped - ion crystal .",
    "instead , the dynamics of excitations in the isotropic limit of the xy model has been explored by considering a single ising model , and thus a single phonon branch to mediate the interactions , subjected to an additional very strong transverse field  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this isotropic limit leads to @xmath23 in the above hamiltonian  . as will become apparent in the following sections ,",
    "this would limit its interest as a simulator of exotic quantum magnets under the duality transformation .",
    "we now introduce a scheme to modify the implementation of refs .",
    "@xcite and obtain a fully - tunable xy model in a longitudinal field by exploiting a single phonon branch .",
    "let us consider the ising model in a longitudinal field , which arises from considering a spin - dependent dipole force coupled to a single radial branch and a carrier transition [ long_ising ] h_i=_i",
    "< j_ij^x_i^x_j^x-_i_i^x . instead of applying a strong transverse field to obtain the isotropic xy model  @xcite ,",
    "let us consider a periodically - modulated transverse field , which may arise from the cross - beam ac - stark shift from a pair of co - propagating lasers with different frequencies .",
    "this is described by h_m(t)=_i(_dt)_i^z , where @xmath24 is the strength of the transverse field , and @xmath25 its modulation frequency , although we note that the following argument could as well be applied for a transverse detuned carrier by simply exchanging @xmath26 .",
    "we start by moving to an interaction picture with respect to the driving , to obtain the following dressed hamiltonian h_i(t)=_i",
    "< j_ij^x_i^+_j^-+_i < j_ij^x(t)_i^+_j^+-_i _ i^++h.c . , where we have introduced the modulation function @xmath27 , and the operators @xmath28 .",
    "by using the jacobi - anger expansion of the exponential in terms of bessel functions , this modulation function can be expressed as @xmath29 .",
    "we can now simplify the hamiltonian considerably if we consider that the modulation frequency is much larger than the couplings of the ising model  , namely @xmath30 . by applying a rotating - wave approximation",
    ", we find a time - independent hamiltonian    h_i(t)&=_i < jj_ij^x_i^+_j^-+_i < jj_ij^x_0(_d/_d)_i^+_j^+ + & -_i h_0(_d/2_d)_i^++h.c . ,    where one observes that some of the coupling strengths are dressed by the zero bessel function . by moving back to the standard pauli spin operators , we obtain the desired @xmath0xy model  , @xmath31 , with the following parameters    j_ij^x&=_ij^x(1+_0(_d/_d))/2 , + j_ij^y&=_ij^x(1-_0(_d/_d))/2 , + h_&=_0(_d/2_d ) .    hence , by controlling two ratios @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , we can access the full phase diagram of the target @xmath0xy model  .",
    "we note that this scheme might be considered as a spin version of the so - called coherent destruction of tunnelling for electrons in solids under periodic electric fields  @xcite , and is the simplest possible modulation scheme that can lead to interesting effective hamiltonians . in the context of trapped ions , other driving terms",
    "have been exploited to simulate the effects of synthetic gauge fields in the vibrational or spin sectors  @xcite .    before moving to the next section , where we exploit the tool of quantum dualities for quantum simulations ,",
    "let us summarize the ingredients that we have introduced so far . _",
    "( i ) _ by loading the ion crystal in a controlled fashion , we can design the number of spins @xmath34 in the synthetic quantum magnets as desired . _",
    "( ii ) _ by combining the resonance fluorescence in a cycling transition  @xcite with global single - spin rotations in the bloch sphere ( i.e. single - qubit gates ) , we can measure the observables @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and so on . _",
    "( iii ) _ by using carrier transitions and far - detuned spin - dependent dipole forces , either along two different vibrational axes with different trap frequencies , or combining a single force with a periodic modulation , we can obtain a synthetic longitudinal xy model with dipolar couplings  .",
    "these three ingredients will be fundamental to propose a dual quantum simulator in the following section .",
    "we shall argue that , even if the dipolar xy model in a longitudinal field does not look more exotic than the standard quantum ising model , it can lead to very interesting phenomena such as quantum frustration when complemented by quantum dualities and certain local measurements which , although complicated for other setups , are accessible in trapped - ion experiments .",
    "the notion of duality in physics , which first appeared in connection to the equations of electromagnetism in the absence of sources , has become a far reaching concept in different disciplines . in this work ,",
    "we shall focus on the use of dualities to understand the properties of many - body lattice models , which started with a seminal work on the self - duality of the ising model on the square lattice  @xcite .",
    "this property permitted locating the critical temperature of the model prior to its exact solution  @xcite , and turned out to be a powerful concept that can be generalized to other situations  @xcite , including also the quantum - mechanical regime  @xcite .",
    "in essence , a duality transformation relates the properties of a particular model in the original lattice @xmath38 with those of a transformed model in the _ dual lattice _",
    "in 1d , which is the regime of interest to our work , the dual lattice is obtained by placing vertices at the links of the original lattice , and setting bonds between those vertices separated by a site of the original lattice .",
    "therefore , the dual lattice of a 1d chain is simply another chain that has been translated by half a lattice constant .",
    "typically , this transformation is defined for infinite bravais lattices , and aims at giving a different perspective of the model under study in the so - called thermodynamic limit . however",
    ", since we are interested in small - scale synthetic magnets , one needs to consider the effects of boundary conditions , which map an original @xmath34-site chain @xmath40 onto an @xmath41-site dual chain @xmath42 [ dual_lattice ]    _ n&:(9,2.5)(1,0)80(-2,2.5)(1,0)12 + & + ^*_n+1&:(2,2.5)(1,0)95(-2,2.5)(1,0)12 +    once these lattices have been defined , let us introduce the quantum duality on the spin operators  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 algebra of the spin operators is preserved by defining the dual spin operators as follows [ dual_operators ] _ i^z=_ji_j^x , _",
    "i^x=_i^y_i+1^y , i^*_n+1 .",
    "then , the dual hamiltonian to the @xmath0xy model   becomes [ dual_lxy ] h^dual_xy=_i >",
    "j(j_ij^x_i-1^z_i^z_j-1^z_j^z+j_ij^y_ik < j_k^x)-_ih_i-1^z_i^z , where the sums must be extended to the dual lattice @xmath42 , and thus to @xmath44 sites . at first sight ,",
    "this dual mapping does not seem to produce any interesting result , since the dual hamiltonian seems to be more convoluted than the original one .",
    "however , exploiting the fast dipolar decay and some additional properties of the spin - spin couplings  , this dual hamiltonian can host a variety of exotic effects .",
    "let us postpone this discussion for the following sections , and address first a question of relevance for the dual quantum simulator .",
    "usually , quantum dualities are used as theoretical tools that allow to understand certain aspects of a particular lattice model from a different perspective . in this manuscript",
    ", we are instead proposing to use them experimentally , which is usually hampered by the non - local character of the dual operators  . in order to understand the properties of the dual model  ,",
    "one typically studies two - point correlators in the dual basis , which become highly - nonlocal correlators in the original lattice , such as [ corr_functions ] _ i^z_i+^z=_i+1^x_i+2^x_i+^x .",
    "therefore , in order to exploit the quantum duality experimentally and understand properties of the model   by performing experiments with the physical hamiltonian  , one needs to measure _ string - order - like parameters _ , which is usually impossible in most physical setups .",
    "however , as argued in the previous sections , these type of observables are exactly the ones that can be obtained via the combination of single - qubit gates and fluorescence in trapped - ion experiments .",
    "apart from correlation functions , also spectral properties give interesting insight into the behavior of a physical system , and important properties such as energy gaps of low - lying excitations are the same for the original model and its dual .",
    "accordingly , spectroscopic measurements in the spirit of the recent experiments  @xcite may provide an alternative way of obtaining relevant information valid for both models .    before entering into the discussion about the exotic magnetic phases that the hamiltonian   can host ,",
    "let us also comment on the other highly - unusual property of our synthetic quantum magnets : the possibility of exactly controlling the number of spins @xmath34 .",
    "critical phenomena and quantum phase transitions take place in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "although this is a mathematical idealization since real systems are always finite , this type of predictions agree considerably well with those based on moderately - large samples , as predicted by _ finite size scaling _",
    "( fss )  @xcite .",
    "although , strictly speaking , phase transitions can only occur at the thermodynamic limit , fss can be considered as a window to extract their infinite - size characteristics ( e.g. critical points and exponents ) by studying the scaling of certain observables with the system size . as occurs with quantum dualities",
    ", fss has been mainly a theoretical tool used in combination with numerical simulations of small systems of increasing size . on the other hand , experimental fss in real materials",
    "would be hampered by difficulties on _",
    "( i ) _ controlling accurately @xmath34 , and _",
    "( ii ) _ distinguishing finite - size effects from other spurious rounding effects ( e.g. disorder , impurities , etc . ) .",
    "this situation has recently changed with trapped - ion experiments  @xcite , where the number of ising spins can be controlled exactly , and where typical disorder and impurity effects are totally absent . moreover ,",
    "the possible rounding effects caused by other sources of noise can be experimentally controlled and identified .    in the following two sections",
    ", we will combine the duality transformation , fss , and non - local observables , to show that the mild - looking hamiltonian   can indeed simulate a variety of exotic magnetic phenomena .",
    "in this section , we want to show that the dual quantum simulator can be used to explore the interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations .",
    "let us first start with a plausibility argument .",
    "one can rearrange the dual hamiltonian   as h^dual_xy = h_qannni(-h , j_i , i+1^x , j_i , i+1^y)+h , where @xmath46 is the so - called _ quantum axial next - nearest - neighbor ising hamiltonian _ ( qannni ) , to be defined below .",
    "if the @xmath47xy - model   was restricted to nearest - neighbour interactions , i. e. if @xmath48 , the dual mapping between @xmath0xy and qannni model would be perfect , that is , the remainder @xmath49 would vanish .",
    "however , since our starting point is the @xmath0xy model with dipolar interactions , @xmath50 will be non - zero introducing a perturbation to the dual mapping .",
    "the hamiltonian of the qannni model is the one of a transverse ising model with frustrated nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions [ qannni ] h_qannni(j_1,j_2,b)=_i(j_1_i^z_i+1^z+j_2_i^z_i+2^z+b_i^x ) . here",
    ", @xmath51 is a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor coupling that corresponds to the longitudinal field of the original hamiltonian  .",
    "this ferromagnetic interaction competes against an antiferromagnetic @xmath52 next - nearest - neighbor coupling , corresponding to the nearest - neighbor xx couplings of the original model , and a transverse magnetic field @xmath53 , corresponding to the nearest - neighbor yy couplings of the original model .",
    "note that these competing ising interactions can be described in a two - leg ladder with triangular motifs , which clarifies the origin of the frustration ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme_duality ] ) .",
    "the parameter equivalence under the duality is thus [ dual_param ] j_1=-h , j_2=j_i , i+1^x , b = j_i , i+1^y .",
    "let us emphasize that the frustration range of the qannni model , given by the ratio of next - nearest- to nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath54 , corresponds to the ratio of two different couplings @xmath55 in the original model   that arise from totally different sources , i.e. a spin - dependent force and a carrier transition .",
    "accordingly , it is simpler to reach all regimes of physical interest @xmath56 by tuning this ratio in the physical model  , than it would be to reach them by shaping the long - range tail of a bare quantum ising model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as @xmath57 , it would be no longer justified to neglect the remaining longer - range tail of the bare ising model , as these additional terms are likely to modify severely the phase diagram .",
    "our method of controlling the range of frustration also seems more straightforward than modifying the crystalline structure in penning  @xcite and surface  @xcite traps , or changing the direction of the lasers / tilting the crystal  @xcite in common rf - traps .",
    "in addition to the qannni hamiltonian , the long - range nature of the interactions in   leads to the following perturbation h=_i=1^n+1_j = i+2^n+1(j_ij^x_i-1^z_i^z_j-1^z_j^z+j_ij^y_ik < j_k^x ) , which contains the dipolar tail of the phonon - mediated interactions starting form the next - nearest - neighbor couplings . due to the fast dipolar decay  , the next - nearest - neighbor couplings are almost one order of magnitude smaller than the nearest - neighbor terms in eq .  , and the longer - range terms get reduced even further .",
    "hence , one can argue that this perturbation will not modify in any essential manner the phase diagram of the qannni model  .",
    "although the duality between the nearest - neighbor models is already known to bear accurate results , we will show below by numerical calculation that our plausibility argument is correct , and that the additional long - range contributions do not modify the usefulness of the duality mapping for quantum simulation purposes .    the model in eq .",
    "is the quantum - mechanical version of the classical annni model  @xcite in a square lattice , as can be proved by applying the quantum - classical mapping  @xcite in the present case  @xcite .",
    "the classical 2d model , which describes stacked ising chains with competing ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and anti - ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor couplings at finite temperatures , is considered to be a paradigm in the physics of magnetic frustration and commensurate / incommensurate phases ( i.e. spatially - modulated arrangements of the magnetic dipoles with a period that is commensurate / incommensurate with the lattice )  @xcite . in addition to the typical second - order phase transitions describing order - disorder phenomena in ising magnets , this model displays different lines separating the commensurate / incommensurate phases , such as kosterlitz - thouless  @xcite and pokrovsky - talapov  @xcite phase transitions , or a disorder line  @xcite connecting unmodulated / modulated disordered paramagnets .",
    "all these thermal phenomena find an analogue in the ground state of the quantum - mechanical model  , where the transverse field @xmath53 plays the role of the temperature by introducing quantum fluctuations that drive the different phase transitions .    in the following",
    ", we make an exhaustive numerical study to assess the importance of the dipolar terms in the trapped - ion realization , and the possibility of observing such a rich phase diagram with state - of - the - art experimental conditions .",
    "* quasi - degenerate energy manifolds : * we plot the energies of the lowest 350 eigenstates of the longitudinal xy model at the frustration point @xmath58 and @xmath59 for dipolar interactions and for nearest - neighbor interactions for system sizes between 11 and 13 . ]",
    "a hallmark of frustration , sometimes even regarded as its defining property , is the existence of a vastly - degenerate ground state manifold that a arises from the impossibility of minimizing simultaneously the conflicting interactions  @xcite . in the dual model  ,",
    "this frustration arises from the competition between ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and anti - ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions .",

    "in this manuscript , we have presented an alternative route to build quantum simulators of exotic magnetism by exploiting the notion of quantum dualities . in certain situations , such as",
    "the ones discussed in this work , such duality transformations allow one to explore interesting models that involve frustration or multi - spin interactions , and their interplay with quantum fluctuations , by focusing on different spin models that are simpler to implement in a particular experimental platform .",
    "this dual approach has one important caveat : measurements of highly non - local observables should be feasible in the particular experiment .",
    "this makes trapped - ion setups ideally suited for this playground of dual quantum simulation .",
    "we have focused on two particular dual quantum simulators which can be implemented using state - of - the - art technology in linear ion crystals , and which allow one to explore paradigmatic models of frustration : the quantum axial nearest - neighbor ising model , and the quantum ising model with competing 2- and 4-body interactions . in the former case ,",
    "we have made a careful numerical study to prove the validity of our scheme , which takes into account relevant perturbations that occur naturally in the trapped - ion scenario .",
    "although we have focused on these two particular examples for ion chains , the notion of dual quantum simulators can be certainly applied to other models , such as the quantum spin liquids , topologically - ordered phases , or ising lattice gauge theories mentioned in the introduction .",
    "provided that quantum magnets are finally synthesized in penning or surface traps , this quantum - duality approach will also become relevant for other lattice geometries , which may define an alternative route to these exotic quantum many - body phenomena .",
    "finally , let us mention that in the recent years another platform for long range spin models has been proposed , namely _ ultracold atoms in nanostructures _ , or more precisely ultracold atoms trapped in a vicinity of tapered fibers and optical crystals ( band gap materials ) .",
    "the experimental progress in coupling of ultracold atomic gases to nanophotonic waveguides is very rapid ( for a recent review cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the ideas and proposals concerning realization of long range spin models were developed for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite , and it would be interesting to explore the possibilities of quantum dualities in this context .",
