    "max - min ( umm ) fairness has been applied in numerous applications since the initial work by cao and zegura @xcite , who attempt to find an optimal resource allocation such that the utilities of all receivers are equal .",
    "hence , the social welfare in the network is equalized .",
    "more precisely , this can be achieved by solving the following optimization problem :    @xmath0    @xmath1    where @xmath2@xmath3 the number of receivers@xmath4 is the receiver index , @xmath5 is defined as the @xmath6 policy ( @xmath7 ) of all available link adaptation policies , which further determines the selected modulation and coding scheme ( mcs ) @xmath8 ( @xmath9@xmath10 the number of total available mcs ) and the allocated power @xmath11 ( @xmath12\\textrm{\\ensuremath{|p_{t}:}the total available transmission power})$ ] , and finally @xmath13 is the utility of receiver @xmath14 due to the applied policy @xmath15 . through this letter",
    ", we assume each @xmath16 is a positive , non - decreasing and normalized utility function of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the max - min problem @xmath17 , has a unique optimal solution under a critical assumption of strict high signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) and concavity of the receiver utilities @xmath13 .",
    "however , there are three impediments in applying the problem formulation ( [ eq : umm - optimization ] ) .",
    "first , the concavity assumption does not hold for real - time applications such as video transmission and voice over ip ( voip ) .",
    "the utility of these applications can be approximated by a step or a sigmoid function .",
    "moreover , the high sinr assumption is not guaranteed in wlans . as a result ,",
    "the optimization problem ( [ eq : umm - optimization ] ) , in general , is a non - convex problem and can not be reduced to geometric programming ( gp ) .",
    "indeed , it belongs to the class of problems known as complementary gp that is , in general , an np - hard or that may require a very complex algorithm to solve @xcite .",
    "second , real - time applications that need a certain amount of transmission resources to provide the minimum required satisfaction ( acceptance ) suffer from so called `` bandwidth starvation '' .",
    "third , in applying the theoretical formulas to predict the bit rate and corresponding frame error rate ( fer ) associated with the link adaptation policy @xmath15 , there are simply too many ways in which the observed measurements and the actual performance fail to match the predictions of the theory @xcite . through this letter",
    ", it is shown that the proposed scheme efficiently addresses these three impediments .",
    "the ieee 802.11ac is developed by extending the airinterface techniques of the 802.11n standard . among the offered features",
    ", the dl - mu exploits the beamforming technique to steer signal maxima on certain receivers while suppressing , or at least greatly reducing the corresponding interference over the others .",
    "the channel state information ( csi ) of the target receivers needs to be known at the transmitter , and it is provided by the channel estimation module in the standard @xcite .    in this letter , we propose a novel , practical , and optimal link adaptation algorithm in order to achieve the max - min fair utility distribution among the receivers in the ieee 802.11ac dl - mu .",
    "we first start with devising a model to predict the fer corresponding to each selected policy @xmath15 in order to address the third aforementioned impediment . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a model , which , by using the concept of effective snr , performs fer prediction for each choice of @xmath15 .",
    "we further extend their model to include beamforming and to match the 802.11ac specification @xcite , as follows . in accordance with the precoding scheme applied by the transmitter ,",
    "the snr of @xmath18th subcarrier of the receiver @xmath14 ( denoted by @xmath19 ) , is obtained based on the available csi at the transmitter .",
    "for instance , in the case of zero - forcing , the average snr value of the certain subcarrier @xmath18 is calculated as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the norm of the vector , @xmath22 is the observed noise variance at the receiver , and @xmath23 is the vector of channel coefficients from @xmath24 antennae of the transmitter to the single antenna of receiver @xmath14 .",
    "additionally , @xmath25 is the unit - norm beamforming weight vector ( @xmath26 ) for receiver @xmath14 . using ( [ eq : snr ] ) , the ber of the wideband downlink channel @xmath27 for modulation of @xmath8 is estimated by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the total number of data subcarriers , and the ber of the subcarrier @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath30 as a function of the symbol snr ( here , @xmath19 ) in the narrowband channel @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath27 is the uncoded bit error probability for the modulation * @xmath8*. in order to obtain the upper bound of the coded fer , we use the union bound on the first - event error probability @xmath31 . by assuming that the frame is transmitted using the convolutional code @xmath32 , then @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the free distance of the code @xmath32",
    ", @xmath35 is the total number of error events of weight @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the probability of an incorrect path of the hamming distance @xmath36 when it diverges from the correct path and then re - merges with it sometime later .",
    "the value of @xmath35 for a specific convolutional code is generated using its transfer function , and @xmath37 is obtained by    @xmath38    therefore , by applying the policy @xmath15 , the predicted upper bound of fer on wideband channel ( here , @xmath39 ) for a frame of length @xmath40 is    @xmath41    using ( [ eq : ber ] ) and ( [ eq : upperboundoffer ] ) , we employ a method similar to @xcite in order to construct the fer prediction model . in this method , based on the available csi , for each non - overlapping range of the transmit power level @xmath42 ( @xmath43$]@xmath44",
    "$ ] and @xmath45 ) , there exists an mcs * @xmath46 * ( @xmath47 $ ] ) such that we predict @xmath48 frame error rate .",
    "note that for each @xmath42 ( and therefore corresponding effective snr ) only one mcs * @xmath46 * results in fer between @xmath49 ( useless ) and @xmath50 ( lossless ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 has the maximum value in the range , unless stated otherwise .",
    "subsequently , the utility value @xmath51 associated with each tuple @xmath52 is calculated using its specific function . on - site calibration",
    "is necessary to obtain tuples of the table @xmath53 of length @xmath54 ( the number of tuples ) for each receiver @xmath14 .",
    "now , we propose a new model to address the second aforementioned impediment .",
    "first , we attempt to determine the policies that satisfy the user - defined constraints .",
    "such constraints are crucial , especially for real - time applications that need a certain amount of transmission resources to provide the required quantity of utility .",
    "we are interested in the policy @xmath55 with the allocated power @xmath56 for each receiver @xmath14 such that the minimum utility requirement is satisfied .",
    "accordingly , the minimization problem with the object function of @xmath51 can be expressed as    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the user - defined minimum value of the required utility .",
    "once the minimum required utility is granted to each receiver by ( [ eq : minutil ] ) , we attempt to maximize all utilities equally using the @xmath17 problem definition .",
    "therefore , we define the utility max - min fair link adaptation problem with the object function of @xmath60 as    @xmath61    @xmath62    we state the polynomial time complexity of the optimal solution to the problem ( [ eq : utility - max - min - model ] ) in the following theorem .",
    "the optimal solution of the addressed problem ( [ eq : utility - max - min - model ] ) can be obtained in @xmath63 .",
    "if the resources can be allocated in advance , the optimal max - min fair solution is achieved by using the progressive filling algorithm @xcite . in this case , the algorithm starts with all utility gains equal to 0 and increases them together at the same pace , until one or several limits are reached .",
    "it continues to increase the gains for other receivers until it is not possible to further increase any utility .",
    "if the policies are sorted descending by their utility values ( gains ) , in the worst case it will take @xmath64 for the algorithm to accomplish this task .",
    "if this is not the case , policies can be sorted in advance , and therefore the time complexity is on the order of @xmath63 .",
    "it is worth noting that the multi - rate wlan suffers from performance anomaly when low - rate streams occupy most of the shared channel time .",
    "according to @xcite , allocating same channel occupation time to the different streams solves this issue and maintains channel time fairness between the streams . in the 802.11ac dl - mu transmission ,",
    "all streams have the same txop time which implies the channel time fairness amongst them in dl - mu transmissions .",
