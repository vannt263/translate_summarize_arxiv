    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics successfully describes high - energy experimental data .",
    "however , the sm involves the theoretical difficulty referred to as `` hierarchy problem '' : due to large quantum corrections , the energy scale of the higgs potential tends to become similar to the cutoff scale of the sm , in spite of the fact that the energy scale should be similar to the known electroweak one .",
    "this suggests that physics beyond the sm appears near the electroweak scale .    among several candidates of the physics beyond the sm , unification of gauge and higgs fields , so - called gauge - higgs unification ,",
    "is known as a promising idea with the help of compactified extra dimensions  @xcite . in the gauge - higgs unification scenario ,",
    "some of the extra - dimensional components of gauge fields are identified to higgs fields at a low - energy regime .",
    "phenomenologically viable electroweak higgs sectors are known to appear with orbifold compactification of the extra dimensions .",
    "an advantageous point of the idea is finiteness of the higgs potential even at some loop levels ; hence , the potential is not sensitive to unknown ultra - violet ( uv ) physics , and the scenario gives a reasonable resolution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the gauge - higgs unification scenario has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the case with flat compactified extra dimensions , the case with a warped extra dimension has been also investigated  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector is predictive thanks to the higher dimensional gauge invariance .",
    "namely , the scenario predicts light higgs scalars , which can be a key ingredient for the experimental test of the scenario at lhc and ilc .",
    "one of the most important subjects is to minutely examine the higgs mass spectrum in the gauge - higgs unification .",
    "several models have been proposed and the mass spectrum has been studied .",
    "an interesting observation is that multi - higgs scalars appear in some models .",
    "the models lead to non - vanishing tree - level higgs potential which has flat directions ; it has revealed that finite radiative corrections to the flat direction lead to the correct electroweak symmetry breaking dynamically  @xcite .",
    "the higgs scalars associated with the flat directions are massless at the tree - level and become massive through the radiative corrections ; their masses have been studied by the one - loop effective potential  @xcite , or even at the two - loop level in a simple model  @xcite .",
    "the other modes among the multi - higgs scalars , which are associated with the non - flat directions , are massive at the tree - level .",
    "loop corrections to their masses , however , have not been focused on even though they are crucial to verify the higgs mass spectrum in the models .",
    "it is also important to examine the spectrum in detail for the experimental test of the scenario .",
    "in addition , the loop corrections to the non - flat directions are considered to be significant for determining the vacuum structure of the multi - higgs potential .",
    "if the corrections are taken into account , then vacua deviated from the flat directions of the tree - level potential may appear .",
    "clearly , such a vacuum structure can not be studied when one focus only on the loop corrections to the flat directions .",
    "thus , to reveal the correct vacuum structure of multi - higgs models , the loop corrections to the non - flat directions should be incorporated .    in this paper , we study the multi - higgs mass spectrum based on one - loop effective potential in a simple 5d model .",
    "we take bulk loop corrections into account for all the modes of the higgs scalars : we study not only the loop corrections for the higgs scalars along the flat direction of the tree - level potential , but also the ones for the higgs scalars along the non - flat direction . as mentioned above , in the past studies , the latter has not been focused on though it is important . in our analyses",
    ", it is found that the one - loop corrections involve an uv divergence , which is proportional to the tree - level potential and is renormalized .",
    "the one - loop corrected multi - higgs mass spectrum is derived through the effective potential after eliminating the divergence .",
    "it turns out that both the tree - massless and massive higgs scalars have mass corrections of similar size from finite parts of the one - loop effects . consequently , the loop effects modify multi - higgs mass spectrum and are significant in view of verifications of the scenario in high - energy experiments .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "mass ] , an overview of multi - higgs mass spectrum in the gauge - higgs unification scenario is presented . in section  [ sec:5dsusy ]",
    ", we examine the one - loop corrected multi - higgs mass spectrum in a simple 5d model . a perturbative calculation of the effective potential is developed to estimate the loop corrections .",
    "summary and future perspective are given in section  [ sec : sum ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : op ] , field dependent operators that are needed to evaluate the effective potential in the model are presented , and appendix  [ sec : loop ] provides the evaluation of loop momentum integrals with the summation of kaluza - klein ( k - k ) modes .",
    "in this section , an overview of the multi - higgs mass spectrum is given .",
    "an interesting observation is that multi - higgs scalars are predicted in some models of the gauge - higgs unification .",
    "models with two extra dimensions compactified on the orbifold @xmath7 are illustrative examples ; at a low - energy regime , the two extra dimensional components of a 6d gauge field behave as a pair of scalar fields , those are identified as two higgs scalars  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that there appear multi - higgs scalars in the 5d models with supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite . due to the susy , a real scalar field",
    "is accompanied by a extra dimensional component of 5d gauge field ( and a weyl fermion ) to form 4d @xmath8 chiral superfield  @xcite ; two higgs scalars hence appear at low energy .    in the above models ,",
    "the low - energy effective theory has a tree - level higgs potential , where flat directions appear . among the higgs scalars , a mode , which corresponds to a flat direction and is a part of the zero modes of the extra dimensional component of the gauge field , triggers off the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "quantum corrections to the flat direction determine the physical vacuum of the theory in terms of the non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the wilson line phase degrees of freedom .",
    "such the dynamical gauge symmetry breaking is known as the hosotani mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the higgs scalar that is the relevant mode to the symmetry breaking as the symmetry - breaking ( sb ) higgs hereafter .",
    "the sb higgs is identified as a zero - mode of extra dimensional components of gauge fields . in addition , gauge fields , non - sb higgs scalars and k - k modes generally appear .",
    "the one - loop effective potential that takes account of only the sb higgs background has been studied ; the correct dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking has been shown to occur through the vev of the sb higgs  @xcite .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , there appear the massive gauge fields , whose mass scale @xmath9 should be much smaller than the typical mass scale of the k - k modes , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of a compactified dimension . in the 5d case , for instance",
    ", the mass of the gauge boson is typically given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vev of the wilson line phase degree of freedom .",
    "the phase is related with the sb higgs as @xmath14 ( mod @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the 5d gauge coupling and @xmath17 is a classical background of the extra dimensional component of the gauge fields , namely the sb higgs",
    ". some of the non - sb higgs scalars also have interaction between the sb higgs in the tree - level potential and have masses of @xmath18 .",
    "since the k - k modes should be sufficiently heavy , a realistic vacuum satisfies @xmath19 and such a vacuum is dynamically realized with an appropriate choice of the bulk matter fields as discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the sb higgs has no mass term in the tree - level potential ; the mass arises from the one - loop effective potential .",
    "the sb higgs tends to be lighter than the massive gauge fields due to the loop suppression factor , which is inconsistent with the experimental bounds of higgs searches  @xcite . a phenomenologically viable sb higgs mass , however , can be realized through enhancement mechanism , as shown in  @xcite .    the loop corrections to the masses of the non - sb higgs",
    "have not been frequently discussed in the gauge - higgs unification .",
    "the large one - loop mass correction to the sb higgs mass implies that there also appear @xmath20 or larger one - loop contributions to the non - sb higgs masses .",
    "the corrections are not suppressed rather than the tree - level masses of the non - sb higgs , and thus are expected to give important effects on the multi - higgs mass spectrum . in order to see this explicitly ,",
    "we examine the one - loop corrections and multi - higgs mass spectrum in a simple model .",

    "we focused on the mass correction for the non - sb ( tree - massive ) higgs and found that both the tree - massless and massive higgs scalars obtain the finite mass collections of similar size from the loop effects .",
    "the results in the analyses implies that the one - loop mass corrections are important not only for the tree - massless modes but also for the massive modes in several realistic models .",
    "for example , in the 5d @xmath252 susy model  @xcite , two - higgs doublets appear at a low - energy regime .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , physical higgs spectrum consists of two cp - even higgs scalars @xmath205 and @xmath206 , a cp - odd higgs scalar @xmath207 and a charged higgs scalar @xmath253 . at the tree - level , some of them",
    "become massive ; the one - loop corrections to their masses are expected to bring important effects .",
    "it is known that the two higgs doublets are also predicted in the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite . except for soft susy",
    "breaking contributions , both models have similar structure of tree - level higgs potential , namely the supersymmetric d - term potential .",
    "since the quantum corrections are expected to play the important role to raise higgs masses in both models , comparison between the higgs spectra is interesting . in 6d setup",
    ", it is also known to appear two higgs doublets , and the similar higgs contents to the above models are expected .",
    "we expect again that the one - loop effects modify the multi - higgs mass spectrum .",
    "it is important to estimate the quantum corrections for the higgs masses in view of high - energy experiments .",
    "moreover , it is an interesting subject to give detailed study of vacuum structure in the above models . in general , minima deviated from the flat directions of tree - level potential may be generated through the radiative corrections , while such minima are not found in our analyses . at the flat direction of the tree - level potential , the ratio between vevs of the two higgs doublets , so - called @xmath254 , is equal to one .",
    "however , if vacua are shifted to non - flat directions through radiative corrections , then @xmath255 is realized in the models",
    ". the higgs mass spectra may be significantly changed by the shift of the vacua .",
    "in addition , the perturbative calculation of the effective potential developed in this paper is useful for examining the 6d case ; approximate behavior of the effective potential for a small vev of the sb higgs , which is not clear even in the flat limit calculation , can be revealed with the perturbative expansion of the potential .",
