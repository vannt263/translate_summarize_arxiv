    "high precision timing of a radio pulsar binary system can reveal a wealth of information about the dynamics of the binary , the astrometry of the system , and the natures of the pulsar and secondary stars .",
    "psr  j1713 + 0747 , a 4.6ms pulsar in a 67.8  day orbit with a white dwarf , is among the very best pulsars for high precision timing : it has a high flux density , shallow spectrum , and sharp pulse peak @xcite .",
    "we observed psr  j1713 + 0747 over six years as part of a systematic high precision pulsar timing study at the arecibo observatory .",
    "we used data acquisition systems employing coherent dedispersion , allowing substantial improvements in timing precision compared to previous work .",
    "early observations of this source were reported by @xcite ( herein cfw ) , who analyzed 1.5 years of pulsar timing data .",
    "previous observations have also been reported by @xcite .",
    "we combined the data of cfw with our newer observations to produce a single data set spanning twelve years .",
    "the superior timing precision of the new data and the longer total time span of observations yield substantial refinements of all measurements reported by cfw , as well as a number of additional new measurements .",
    "high precision detection of the shapiro delay allows the pulsar and secondary star masses to be separately measured .",
    "the shapiro delay measurement reported in cfw did not have sufficient precision to independently determine the pulsar and secondary star masses .",
    "these quantities are of interest because , while measured double neutron star masses fall into a very narrow range , 1.25 to 1.44@xmath7   @xcite , extended accretion during the formation of pulsar  white dwarf binaries may lead to higher pulsar masses in these systems .",
    "high precision timing of pulsars can be used to place limits on the gravitational wave background at frequencies of @xmath8 to @xmath9 hz by searching for arrival time variations on time scales of years @xcite , but such measurements require that the timing signal not be contaminated by `` timing noise , '' random variations of the pulsar rotation .",
    "timing noise is inversely correlated with rotation period derivative @xcite , so millisecond pulsars , which have very small period derivatives , are prime candidates for gravitational wave studies .",
    "the 12-year time span of data on psr  j1713 + 0747 has revealed significant pulse arrival variations beyond those expected from simple magnetic dipole spin - down .",
    "we quantify this apparent timing noise , but we leave the analysis of the psr  j1713 + 0747 signal in the context of the gravitational wave background to another work",
    ".    we detected both annual and secular perturbations of orbital elements due to the changing earth ",

    "this is only the second pulsar binary system for which timing observations have fully specified both angles of the orbital orientation @xcite .",

    "a shutdown of the telescope for an upgrade resulted in a gap in the observations between 1994 and 1998 .",
    "observations made in 1992 and 1993 are described in cfw .",
    "briefly , those data consist of 68 toas collected at intervals of about two weeks using the princeton mark  iii observing system @xcite coupled to a @xmath12mhz filter bank , with 32 spectral channels for each sense of polarization . in every scan , the square - law detected outputs of each pair of channels ( representing two polarizations ) were smoothed with time constants of 20@xmath13s or 78@xmath13s , summed , folded synchronously at the predicted pulse period , and shifted in time to remove dispersive delay .",
    "the channels were then summed to create total - intensity pulse profiles of 256 bins .    from 1998 through 2004 , observations were made using princeton mark  iv system @xcite and the arecibo - berkeley pulsar processor ( abpp ) , often running in parallel to analyze the same radio frequency signal .",
    "a total of 275 toas were obtained on 132 different days , usually at intervals of a few weeks , but occasionally more densely sampled .",
    "a typical day included an hour of observations at 1410mhz and a half hour of observations at 2380mhz .",
    "the mark  iv system critically samples and records 10 mhz pass bands in each sense of circular polarization , quantized with 2-bit resolution .",
    "the recorded voltages are analyzed off line : the data stream is coherently dedispersed , after which the self- and cross - products of the voltages are calculated and folded synchronously at the pulse period .",
    "observations are continuous over ( typically ) 29 minute intervals , but are analyzed in blocks of 190 seconds , each of which yields a 1024 bin pulse profile with four stokes parameters .",
    "the abpp filters the passband into narrow spectral channels , samples voltages with 2-bit resolution , and applies coherent dedispersion to each channel using 3-bit coefficients . for psr  j1713 + 0747 at 1410mhz ,",
    "thirty - two spectral channels of width 1.75mhz are processed in each polarization , for a total bandwidth of 56mhz ; at 2380mhz , the channel bandwidths are 3.5mhz , for a total bandwidth of 112mhz .",
    "the dedispersed time series in each channel is folded synchronously at the pulse period and integrated for 180 seconds .",
    "we used conventional techniques to measure pulse arrival times . for the mark",
    "iii and mark  iv data , each pulse profile was cross - correlated with a standard template to measure the phase offset of the pulse within the profile . for the abpp data ,",
    "an analytical model of the pulse profile was fit to each data profile . in either case ,",
    "the time offset measured from the profile was added to the start time of the integration and translated to its middle to yield a toa .",
    "the start times were referenced to the observatory atomic clock , which was corrected retroactively to the utc timescale using data from the global positioning system ( gps ) satellites . for each data acquisition system , all toas at a given frequency collected on a given day",
    "were averaged to make a single effective toa .",
    "the time intervals spanned by these average points is listed as `` typical integration '' in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the abpp and mark  iv systems often ran in parallel , analyzing the same radio frequency signal processed through the same amplifiers and many of the same filters .",
    "of the toas summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] , seventy - six pairs of abpp and mark  iv toas were collected simultaneously .",
    "nevertheless , we have treated them as independent data streams in the timing analysis .",
    "there are two justifications for this approach .",
    "first , the width of the passband measured by the abpp is substantially larger than that measured by mark  iv , so the signal measured by the two machines are somewhat different .",
    "second , empirical tests of the residual arrival times , after removing the best fit timing model , show only modest correlation between toas measured by the two systems .",
    "correlation coefficients are 0.33 and 0.30 for the 1410 and 2380mhz residual toas , respectively .",
    "we found that formal measurement uncertainties calculated directly from the toa measurements of individual data records tended to moderately underestimate the true scatter in the arrival times .",
    "the cause of the underestimation is not known , but it is a common phenomenon in millisecond pulsar timing .",
    "a particular challenge for these observations is the correction of the coarse quantization of incoming signals given the highly variable nature of the signals . in any case , we added `` systematic '' terms in quadrature to these formal uncertainties in order to produce timing fits with reduced @xmath14 values close to 1",
    ". the root - mean - square ( rms ) residual arrival times listed in table  [ tab : obs ] were calculated by giving all toas equal weight , independent of uncertainties .",
    "we used the tempo software package to fit a pulse timing model to the observed toas . the model incorporated pulsar rotation , astrometry , orbital motion , and dispersion of the pulsar signal by the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "the fits allowed for arbitrary time offsets between sets of toas taken with different observing systems and at different frequencies .",

    "we describe the elements of the timing model in detail .",
    "we defer discussion of the results of the model fit until  [ sec : grid ]",
    ". however , we will make reference of these results to justify components of the timing model .      the pulsar rotation frequency at time @xmath15 can be written as a polynomial expansion , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a reference epoch near the center of the data span and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc .",
    ", are the pulsar rotation frequency , frequency derivative , frequency second derivative , and so on . under the standard model of a neutron star with a rotating magnetic dipole , a millisecond pulsar such as psr  j1713 +",
    "0747 should have negligibly small values of @xmath20 and higher order terms .",
    "however , timing fits incorporating only @xmath18 and @xmath19 leave a systematic signature in the residual arrival times after removing the best - fit model ( figure  [ fig : res ] ) . to remove the long - term systematic trend , we `` whitened '' the data by incorporating seven additional terms to the model , @xmath20 through @xmath21 .",
    "these terms correspond to time scales on the order of years , much longer than the orbital period of the pulsar , and hence they have negligible effect on the measurement of orbital elements .",
    "radio pulses traversing the solar system and the interstellar medium are delayed by dispersion .",
    "the time delay in seconds is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radio frequency in hz and the integral of electron density along the line of sight , @xmath24 , is the dispersion measure in pc@xmath25 .",
    "observations at two frequencies , 1410 and 2380 mhz , over the last 5 years of observations , allow us to search for variations in dm over time .",
    "of particular concern are variations due to propagation through the ionized solar wind as the earth moves about the sun .",
    "we modeled the solar electron density at distance @xmath26 from the sun as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron density at r=1au which we take as a free parameter in the pulsar timing solution .",
    "the solar contribution to @xmath29 is calculated by integrating @xmath30 along the path from earth toward the pulsar .",
    "ulysses data have shown the @xmath31 scaling to hold over a wide range of heliocentric latitudes @xcite . the @xmath31 model is clearly an oversimplification  it neglects the substantial difference between the high density slow wind along the ecliptic and the low density wind at high latitudes , and it does not allow for temporal variations in @xmath28 .",
    "however , because it has a simple analytic form and requires only a single additional parameter in the fit , it is a convenient form to use for the timing model .",
    "the best fit electron density at 1au is @xmath32electrons per @xmath33 .",
    "this gives peak - to - peak dm variations of 0.0002pc@xmath25 , and arrival time variations of 400ns at 1410mhz .",
    "orbital kinematics were incorporated into the timing model by means of the theory - independent representation of damour & deruelle ( 1986 ) .",
    "parameters of the orbital model include ( 1 ) five keplerian orbital elements : orbital period , @xmath34 ; semi - major axis projected into the line of sight , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the semi - major axis , @xmath37 the inclination angle , and @xmath38 the speed of light ; eccentricity , @xmath39 ; angle of periastron , @xmath40 ; and time of periastron passage , @xmath41 ; ( 2 ) secular variations of the keplerian elements , most notably the time derivative of @xmath42 , denoted @xmath43 ; ( 3 ) the orientation of the system , defined by the inclination of the orbit , @xmath37 , where @xmath44 , and the position angle of ascending node , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath45 is defined north through east is north and @xmath47 is east . for inclination , we follow the convention that an orbit with @xmath48 has an angular momentum vector pointing toward earth .",
    "these definitions differs from kopeikin ( 1995 , 1996 ) and @xcite , who define @xmath45 such that @xmath49 is east and @xmath47 is north , and define @xmath48 to be an orbit with angular momentum vector pointing away from earth .",

    "the constraints on @xmath51 and @xmath37 that arise from this measurement are quantified in  [ sec : grid ] . since @xmath58 ( see figure  [ fig : angles ] ) , there in an ambiguity in deriving @xmath37 from @xmath56 in equation  [ eqn : shapiro ] , because both @xmath37 and @xmath59 are solutions .",
    "the resolution of this ambiguity is discussed below .",
    "proper motion of a binary system results in secular changes in @xmath40 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "for a nearly circular orbit , a secular change in @xmath40 is indistinguishable from a small perturbation of the orbital period , and hence is unmeasurable .",
    "in contrast , the secular change in @xmath42 is significant .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is given by @xmath60 where @xmath13 and @xmath61 are the magnitude and position angle of the proper motion , respectively .",
    "in effect , @xmath37 is determined by the shapiro delay (  [ sec : shapiro ] ) , and @xmath45 is then constrained by the @xmath43 measurement .",
    "solving equation  [ eqn : xdot ] for @xmath45 yields two possible values for each of the two values of @xmath37 (  [ sec : shapiro ] ) .",
    "thus there are four distinct binary orientations ( combinations of @xmath37 and @xmath45 ) allowed by the shapiro delay and @xmath43 measurements .",
    "the earth s annual motion about the solar system barycenter changes the line - of - sight to the binary system and perturbs the binary parameters @xmath42 and @xmath40 , an effect known as annual - orbital parallax @xcite .",
    "we incorporated annual - orbital parallax into the timing model by perturbing the values of @xmath42 and @xmath40 before calculating pulse arrival time delays using a standard orbital model .",
    "the perturbation formulae are given by kopeikin ( 1995 ) ; we summarize them here .",
    "the position of the earth relative to the solar system barycenter is given by the vector x , y , z. the pulsar position is right ascension @xmath62 and declination @xmath63 .",
    "define @xmath64 these are the east and north motions of the earth in a coordinate system parallel to the plane of the sky .",

    "( nevertheless , the @xmath42 perturbation was included in the timing model , since it introduced no additional degrees of freedom . ) on the other hand , the perturbations of @xmath40 are sufficiently large that incorporating them into the timing model significantly improves the goodness of the timing fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : annorb ] shows the @xmath14 values for fits with and without the annual - orbital parallax perturbations . in these fits , @xmath50 , @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and @xmath45 were treated as independent parameters , unconstrained by equation  [ eqn : xdot ] ; hence the best - fit range of @xmath45 in figure  [ fig : annorb ] differs somewhat from that given in  4 .    as a practical matter , for psr  j1713 + 0747 the annual - orbital parallax does little to improve the precision of the timing parameter measurements ( since @xmath37 and @xmath45 are better measured by shapiro delay and @xmath43 ) .",

    "we combine these uncertainties in quadrature to find @xmath126mas . as a check",
    ", a special timing fit was done incorporating only days on which multifrequency observations were made , and fitting for a separate value of dm on each day on which observations were made , yields a parallax of @xmath127 , consistent with our preferred value .",
    "the parallax measurement corresponds to a distance of @xmath128kpc .    for psr j1713 + 0747 s measured value of dm , the ne2001 model of the galactic electron density @xcite gives a distance of 0.9kpc , in good agreement with the parallax measurement .",
    "right ascension and declination are also highly covariant with @xmath28 ; their uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : param ] were calculated in the same manner as the parallax uncertainty .",
    "it is well established that millisecond pulsars have substantially smaller velocities than the bulk pulsar population , with a mean transverse velocity of @xmath129kms@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the transverse velocity of psr  j1713 + 0747 , @xmath130 , is small even by the standards of millisecond pulsars .",
    "the observed pulse period derivative , @xmath131 , is biased away from its intrinsic value , @xmath97 , by doppler accelerations .",
    "@xcite analyzed this bias for orbital period derivatives ; their work applies equally well to spin period derivatives .",
    "the observed and intrinsic quantities are related by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the bias due to proper motion ; @xmath134 is the bias due to the relative acceleration of pulsar and earth in the galactic plane , @xmath135 , projected into a unit vector pointing from earth to pulsar , @xmath136 ; and @xmath137 is the bias due to the acceleration of the pulsar toward the galactic disk , @xmath138 , projected into the line - of - sight .    for psr  j1713 + 0747 , we find @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the latter calculated using the potential of @xcite .",

    "a discrepancy between the characteristic age and the true age of a millisecond pulsar is not uncommon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and implies that the millisecond pulsar period immediately after spin - up was close to its present day value .",
    "it seems likely that millisecond pulsars form with periods of a few milliseconds @xcite .",
    "the surface magnetic field strength of the pulsar according to conventional assumptions is @xmath146 .",
    "this value is typical of millisecond pulsars .",
    "the psr  j1713 + 0747 timing data show timing noise .",
    "analysis of the timing noise is complicated by the large gap in the data between 1994 and 1998 and because of the need to allow an offset in the arrival times before and after the gap . to analyze timing noise , we calculated residuals for a timing model fitting for only the pulsar spin - down parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 and an arbitrary offset between the pre-1994 and post-1998 data .",
    "astrometric and binary parameters were held fixed at the values derived from the whitened timing model fit .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : res]a .",
    "timing noise can be quantified by the fractional stability statistic @xmath147 , an adaptation of the `` allan variance '' statistic with modifications appropriate for pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "in essence , @xmath147 for time interval @xmath99 is calculated by dividing the post - fit residual arrival times , @xmath148 , into intervals spanning length @xmath99 , and fitting third order polynomials over each interval , @xmath149 .",
    "the first three terms of the polynomial are accounted for by the pulsar spin - down model .",
    "the final term , @xmath150 , is a measure of timing noise .",

    "the physical mechanism underlying timing noise is not known .",
    "@xcite studied a large collection of pulsars using a statistic , @xmath155 , which is the logarithm of a scaled version of @xmath152 at @xmath156 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . from figure",

    "this formula predicts @xmath160 for psr j1713 + 0747 , close to the observed upper limit .",
    "thus the rotational stability of j1713 + 0747 is as good ( or better ) than expected , despite the long - term timing noise .",
    "as discussed above , we used the de405 solar system ephemeris to reduce the pulse arrival times to the solar system barycenter . to reduce pulse arrival times measured with uncertainty of only @xmath161ns , the earth s position with respect to the barycenter",

    "we analyzed our data with both de405 and its predecessor , de200 . to compare the two ephemerides",
    ", we performed timing fits on the the post-1998 data . excluding the earlier data from these tests allowed us to avoid problems stemming from the arbitrary offset between the earlier and later data . using each ephemeris , we fit the data to a full timing model , fitting for all the standard parameters but not allowing pulse frequency derivatives above @xmath19 ( i.e. , no timing noise terms ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : eph ] .",
    "the de405 ephemeris clearly gives a better fit .",
    "the differences in timing quality are easily explained by differences in the ephemerides themselves , particularly the incorporation of improved measurements of outer planet masses into de405 ( e. m. standish , private communication ) .",
    "psr  j1713 + 0747 is one of several long - orbit , low - eccentricity binary pulsars which have been used to set limits on violations of equivalence principles @xcite .",
    "the relevant observational signatures depend on the orientations of the binary systems under study , something not usually known ; hence , probabilistic arguments have been used to constrain equivalence principle violations based on observations of several pulsars .",
    "in contrast , we have established the orientation ( @xmath37 and @xmath45 ) to psr  j1713 + 0747 , and we have measured its distance as well .",
    "this allows us to set the first absolute limits both on violation of the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) and on the magnitude of the strong - field equivalent of the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter @xmath163 .",
    "if the sep were violated , objects with different fractional mass contributions from self - gravitation would fall differently in an external gravitational field .",
    "this is quantified by the parameter @xmath164 , defined through @xmath165 , where @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 are the gravitational mass , inertial mass , and gravitational self - energy of a body .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath164 would result in the polarization of binary orbits @xcite .",
    "lunar laser ranging experiments set limits on the polarization of the earth - moon orbit in the gravitational field of the sun , constraining @xmath169 to be less than 0.001 @xcite . in the case of a pulsar  white - dwarf binary , the orbit would be polarized in the direction of the gravitational pull of the galaxy .",
    "the parameter to be constrained , @xmath170 , is similar to @xmath164 , but without the requirement of linear dependence on @xmath171 .",

    "the value of @xmath186 can be determined from models of the galactic potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the galactic rotation curve ; for a pulsar out of the plane of the galaxy , @xmath185 is given by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the galactic radius of the pulsar , @xmath189 is the distance from the earth to the galactic center , @xmath190 is the distance from the pulsar to the galactic plane , and @xmath88 and @xmath90 are the galactic coordinates of the pulsar .    historically , both @xmath180 and @xmath45 have been completely unknown for the pulsars used to test for violation of the sep , and the tests have therefore made statistical arguments , assuming both angles to be uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath191 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "the masses have also been poorly constrained and thus averages over likely model populations were also needed @xcite . following these procedures ,",
    "an ensemble of long - orbit pulsars yields a limit of @xmath192 at 95% confidence .    with both masses and the angle of the line of nodes",
    "well - constrained for psr  j1713 + 0747 , a single , more robust limit on violation of the sep becomes possible . because of the complicated dependence of @xmath170 on the pulsar distance , as well as the asymmetric distribution of allowed masses , we obtain the limit via monte carlo simulation , assuming the parallax to be normally distributed and @xmath180 to be uniformly distributed , and sampling the allowed @xmath51@xmath73@xmath45 range according the probability distribution derived from the @xmath14 grid discussed above .",

    "we assume that the pulsar spin and orbital angular momenta have been aligned during the spin - up episode that recycled the pulsar .",

    "the radial component of this second velocity vector is unknown .",
    "we checked a range of radial velocities from @xmath211km / s and @xmath212km / s ; for each simulation point , we adopted the value that gives the smallest projection of the total velocity onto the plane of the orbit .",
