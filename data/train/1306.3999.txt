    "holographic space time ( hst ) is a formalism for generalizing string theory to situations where the asymptotic regions of space - time are not frozen vacuum states . in particular",
    ", it gives us a well defined holographic quantum theory of big bang cosmology@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two of the authors ( tb and wf ) introduced a model of hst , which they claimed could reproduce the results of slow - roll inflation . in this paper , we use results from @xcite,@xcite and @xcite to prove and improve that claim . as a consequence we will show that _ if the two - point functions of inflationary fluctuations coincide with those in a single - field slow - roll model , then they probe only coarse features of the underlying fundamental quantum theory . _ any model which produces small , approximately gaussian , approximately @xmath1 covariant fluctuations yields two- and three - point functions determined by two unitary representations of @xmath1 .",
    "a generic model has @xmath2 parameters : the scaling dimension of the scalar operator on the projective light cone ( see below ) ; the strength of the scalar and tensor gaussian fluctuations ; the normalizations of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 three - point functions ; and the 3 different tensor structures in the @xmath6 three - point function .",
    "maldacena s squeezed limit theorem , when combined with @xmath1 , fixes all 3-point functions involving the scalar in terms of the scale dependence of the corresponding two - point functions , reducing the number of parameters to @xmath7 and its first two time derivatives . ] . a general quantum theory with @xmath1 invariance and localized operators @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 contains many invariant density matrices , and the two- and three - point functions do not determine either the underlying model or the particular invariant density matrix .",
    "finally , we note that the dominance of the scalar over the tensor two - point fluctuations , which is evident in the cmb data , follows from general cosmological perturbation theory along with the assumptions that there was a period of near ds evolution and that the intrinsic @xmath8 and @xmath9 fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude , which is the case in both conventional slow - roll models and the hst model of inflation .",
    "however , hst predicts a different dependence of the fluctuation normalizations on the time dependent background @xmath10 . for correlation functions involving the scalar ,",
    "this difference can be masked by choosing different backgrounds to fit the data .",
    "hst makes the unambiguous prediction that the tensor tilt vanishes , whereas conventional slow roll predicts it to be @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the ratio of amplitudes of tensor and scalar fluctuations ) and data already constrains @xmath13 , so this may be hard to differentiate from zero even if we observe the tensor fluctuations .",
    "we have noted a set of relations for fluctuations that follow from very general properties of cosmological perturbation theory . for us ,",
    "the validity of classical cosmological perturbation theory follows from jacobson s observation that einstein s equations ( up to the cosmological constant , which in hst is a boundary condition for large proper times ) are the hydrodynamic equations of a system , like hst , which obeys the bekenstein - hawking relation between entropy and area . in @xcite",
    "we argued that this meant that there would be a hydrodynamic inflaton field ( or fields ) even in regimes where hst is not well - approximated by _",
    "quantum _ effective field theory ( queft ) .",
    "the fluctuations calculated from an underlying hst model , which we argued to be approximately @xmath1 covariant and whose magnitude we estimated , are put into the classical hydrodynamical inflaton equations as fluctuating initial conditions . in fact , in the co - moving gauge , we can view the inflaton as part of the metric and this picture follows from jacobson s original argument . ] .",
    "we will argue below that certain constraints on the parameters not determined by symmetries follow from quite general arguments based on classical cosmological perturbation theory , while other constraints correspond to a choice of parameters in the underlying discrete hst model .",
    "note that , within the hst framework , the validity of classical cosmological perturbation theory is a statement about the jacobsonian hydrodynamics of a system , which is not well - approximated by queft .",
    "the constraints fix the @xmath1 representation of the tensor fluctuations , and imply the dominance of scalar over tensor fluctuations .",
    "when combined with estimates from the hst model , these constraints suggest that the tensor two - point function _ might _ be observed in the planck data .",
    "non - gaussian fluctuations involving at least one scalar component are small .",
    "the most powerful discriminant between models is the tensor 3 point function .",
    "standard slow - roll models produce only one of the three forms allowed by symmetry .",
    "a second one can be incorporated by adding higher derivative terms to the bulk effective action , but the validity of the bulk effective field theory expansion requires it to be smaller than the dominant term .",
    "the third form violates parity and can not arise in any model based on bulk effective field theory .",
    "we argue that it could be present in more general models , if parity is not imposed as a fundamental symmetry . unfortunately , all extant models , whether based on effective field theory or hst , predict that the tensor 3 point function is smaller than the , as yet unobserved , tensor two - point function by a power of @xmath14 and we can not expect to detect it in the foreseeable future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the mathematical analysis of two- and three - point functions in a generic quantum theory carrying a unitary representation of @xmath1 , written in terms of operators localized on a three sphere .",
    "we emphasize that this theory does not satisfy the axioms of quantum field theory on the three sphere .",
    "in particular , it does not satisfy reflection positivity , because the hamiltonian is a generator of a unitary representation of @xmath1 , and it is not bounded from below .",
    "the absence of highest weight generators prevents the usual continuation to a lorentzian signature space - time . in consequence ,",
    "a general theory of this type will have a large selection of ds invariant density matrices , rather than the unique pure state of conventional cft .",
    "nonetheless , two- and three - point functions are completely determined by symmetry , up to a few constants .",
    "the work of maldacena and collaborators@xcite ( see also later work of mcfadden and skenderis@xcite and others@xcite ) shows that , to leading order in slow - roll parameters , single field slow - roll inflation is in this category of theories .",
    "thus , the oft - heard claim that objections to the conceptual basis of slow - roll inflation must be wrong , because the theory fits the data , are ill - founded .",
    "our analysis shows that current data probe only certain approximate symmetries of a theory of primordial fluctuations , and determine a small number of parameters that are undetermined by group theory .",
    "furthermore , the success of the slow - roll fit to these parameters , amounts , so far , to the statement that the fluctuations are predicted to be small and approximately gaussian ; that the scaling exponents are within a small range around certain critical values ; and that the scalar two - point function is much larger than that of the tensor . given the central limit theorem , the first part of this prediction does not seem to be such an impressive statement .",
    "note also that if there is any environmental selection going on in the explanation of the initial conditions of the universe , even the statement that the fluctuations are small might be understood as environmental selection .",
    "the fact that the scalar two - point function dominates the tensor is a consequence of general properties of classical gravitational perturbation theory around a background which is approximately de sitter .",
    "the relative sizes of various three - point functions were also derived by maldacena in this quite general setting .",
    "we should emphasize that our remarks are relevant to data analysis only if future data remains consistent with slow - roll inflation .",
    "there is a variety of inflationary models , and many of them produce non - gaussian fluctuations which are not @xmath1 covariant .",
    "if future observations favor such a model , they would rule out the simple symmetry arguments , and disprove both slow - roll inflation and the holographic model of inflation . thus",
    ", although we set out to prove that our hst model _ could _ fit the data , we have ended up realizing that the current data probe only a few general properties of the underlying theory of primordial fluctuations . at the moment , we do not have enough control over our model to make predictions that go beyond these simple ones .",
    "in section 3 we sketch the holographic inflation ( hi ) model of @xcite and recall how it leads to a prediction of small , approximately gaussian , approximately @xmath1 invariant fluctuations .",
    "it also resolves all of the conceptual problems of conventional inflation and gives a completely quantum mechanical and causal solution to the flatness and horizon problems , as well as an explanation of the homogeneity and isotropy of the very early universe  all of the latter without inflation . within the hst formalism",
    ", the hi model also explains why there is any local physics in the world , despite the strong entropic pressure to fill the universe with a single black hole at all times .    in the conclusions we discuss ways in which the data might distinguish between different models of fluctuations .",
    "appendix a recalls the conceptual problems of conventional inflation models , while appendix b recalls the unitary irreducible representations of @xmath1 .",
    "in early work on holographic cosmology@xcite tb and wf postulated that inflation took place at a time when the universe was well described by effective quantum field theory ( queft ) , and that the inflaton was a quantum field .",
    "our attitude to this began to change as a consequence of two considerations .",
    "the first was that , although inflationary cosmology and de sitter space are _ not _ the same thing , it seemed plausible that at least part of the fully quantum version of inflationary cosmology should involve evolution of independent ds horizon volumes in a manner identical to a stable ds space , over many e - foldings .",
    "however , over such time scales we expected each horizon volume to be fully thermalized .",
    "the black hole entropy formulas in ds space tell us that the fully thermalized state has _ no local excitations _ and therefore is not well modeled by field theory .    in parallel with this realization",
    ", we began to appreciate jacobson s 1995 argument@xcite , indicating that the classical einstein equations were just hydrodynamics for a system obeying the local connection between area and entropy , for maximally accelerated rindler observers .",
    "the gravitational field should only be quantized in special circumstances where the covariant entropy bound is far from saturated and bulk localized excitations are decoupled from most of the horizon degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "jacobson s argument does not give a closed system of equations , because it does not provide a model for the stress tensor .",
    "we realized that this meant that other fields like the inflaton , which provide the stress tensor model , could also be classical hydrodynamical fields , unrelated to the queft fields that describe particle physics in the later stages of the universe .",
    "in @xcite tb and wf constructed a model which begins with a maximal entropy @xmath15 big bang , passes through a stage with @xmath16 decoupled horizon volumes of ds space and evolves to a model with approximate @xmath1 invariance .",
    "the corrections to @xmath1 for correlation functions of a small number of operators are of order @xmath17 . in trying to assess the extent to which the predictions of such a model could fit cmb and large scale structure data",
    ", we realized that , to leading order in the slow - roll approximation , _ the results of many conventional inflationary models amounted to a prediction of approximate @xmath1 invariance and the choice of a small number of parameters . _ work of @xcite,@xcite and @xcite has shown that even if we can measure all two- and three - point functions of both scalar and tensor fluctuations , there are only @xmath2 parameters .",
    "some of these parameters are related , by an argument due to maldacena .",
    "current measurements only determine two of the parameters and bound some of the others ( the tensor spectral index ca nt be measured until we actually see tensor fluctuations ) .",
    "our conclusion is that observations and general principles tell us only that the correct theory of the inflationary universe has the following properties    * it is a quantum theory that is approximately @xmath1 invariant , and the density matrix of the universe at the end of inflation is approximately invariant .",
    "there are many such density matrices in a typical reducible representation of @xmath1 . *",
    "the tensor and scalar fluctuations are expectation values of operators transforming in two particular representations of @xmath1 .",
    "cmb and lss data determine the normalization of the two - point function and representation of the scalar operator , and put bounds on the two - point function of the tensor and all 3 point functions .",
    "if future measurements detect neither b mode polarization nor indications that the fluctuations are non - gaussian , then we will learn no more about the correct description of the universe before and during the inflationary era .",
    "* when combined with maldacena s  squeezed limit \" theorem and general features of cosmological perturbation theory around an approximately ds solution , @xmath1 invariance gives results almost equivalent to a single field slow - roll model .",
    "we will discuss the differences below .",
    "thus , it is possible that even measurement of _ all _ the two- and three - point functions will teach us only about the symmetry properties of the underlying model .",
    "in fact , measurement of the tensor 3-point function could rule out conventional slow roll , but would not distinguish between more general models obeying the symmetry criteria described above .",
    "in particular , the models proposed in @xcite , which resolve all of the conceptual problems of queft based inflation models ( see appendix a ) , will fit the current data as well as any conventional model . at our current level of understanding",
    ", those models do not permit us to give a detailed prediction for the scalar tilt , apart from the fact that it should be small .",
    "the tensor tilt is predicted to vanish .",
    "hst models suggest very small non - gaussianity in correlation functions involving scalar perturbations , as we will see below , and explain why the scalar two - point function is much larger than that of the tensor .",
    "indeed , this follows from @xmath1 symmetry , maldacena s long wavelength theorem for scalar fluctuations , and very general properties of classical gravitational fluctuations around a nearly ds frw model .",
    "classical cosmological perturbation theory identifies two gauge invariant quantities , which characterize fluctuations , and transform as a scalar and a transverse traceless tensor under @xmath18 .",
    "we will attempt to find @xmath1 covariant operators , whose expectation values give us the two- and three - point correlation functions of these fluctuations .",
    "the form of these fluctuations is determined by group theory , up to a few constants .    in order to handle @xmath1 transformation properties in a compact manner",
    ", we use the description of the 3-sphere as the projective future light cone in @xmath19 dimensional minkowski space .",
    "that is , it is the set of @xmath20 component vectors @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 , @xmath23 and identified under @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "fields on the sphere are @xmath1 tensor functions of @xmath26 , which transform as representations of the group of identifications , isomorphic to @xmath27 .",
    "these representations are characterized by their tensor transformation properties , covariant constraints , and a single complex number @xmath28 such that @xmath29 so that the field is completely determined by its values on the sphere .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath28 are constrained by the unitarity of the representation of @xmath1 in the hilbert space of the theory .",
    "an expectation value of the products of two or three of these operators , in any ds invariant density matrix , is determined in terms of the @xmath2 numbers discussed above . for the tensor modes ,",
    "the determination of the 3 point function has been demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite , but there is not yet a compact formula . we hope that the five dimensional formalism will provide one , but we reserve this for future work .    ordinary qft in ds space has _ many _",
    "ds invariant states , both pure and impure , as a consequence of the fact that there are no highest weight unitary representations of @xmath1 vacua , which are states of gaussian quantum fields whose two - point function is ds invariant , but has singularities when a point approaches its anti - pode .",
    "rather , in the context of bulk queft , we re speaking about ds invariant excitations of the conventional bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "these are not represented by gaussian wave functionals . ] . in conventional cft ,",
    "the product of two lowest weight representations contains only representations of weight higher than the sum of the individual weights , but this is not true for unitary representations of @xmath1 .",
    "products of non - trivial irreps can have singlet components .",
    "we can make even more general @xmath1 invariant density matrices by taking weighted sums of the projectors on this plethora of pure invariant states .",
    "this is in marked contrast to conventional cft , whose hilbert space consists of lowest weight unitary representations of @xmath30 and has a unique invariant state .",
    "nonetheless , because the constraints of ds invariance on @xmath31 and @xmath32 point functions are expressed as analytic partial differential equations , in which the cosmological constant appears as an analytic parameter , these functions _ are _ analytic continuations of corresponding expressions in ordinary cft . while we do not think that qft in ds space is the correct theory of inflationary fluctuations , nor that the quantum theory of ds space is @xmath1 invariant ; we do think that it is plausible that the quantum theory of a cosmology that has a large number of e - folds of inflation , followed by sub - luminal expansion which allows observers to see all of that space - time , should have an approximate @xmath1 symmetry realized by unitary operators in a hilbert space .",
    "this was explained in @xcite .    the scaling symmetry @xmath27 plays another useful role , since we are trying to make a quantum model of many horizon volumes of the asymptotic future of a classical ds space .",
    "ds space asymptotes to the future light cone @xmath33 , and the rescaling transformation is simply time evolution in either the global or flat slicing",
    ". the two times are asymptotically equivalent . for large time in the flat slicing",
    ", we have @xmath34 thus , the scaling dimension of the operator tells us about its large time behavior in the flat slicing of ds space .",
    "the field corresponding to the scalar fluctuations is a scalar @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . in this formula",
    "@xmath37 is the mass of a bulk scalar field , which would give rise to this representation by ds / cft calculations , as in @xcite , when evaluated in the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "it parametrizes one of the series ( called class i in appendix b ) of unitary representations of @xmath1 described in @xcite .",
    "these are the analogs of the complementary and principal series of unitary representations of @xmath38 . in ordinary qft in ds space , the wheeler - dewitt wave function for this bulk field determines the in - in correlator of the corresponding bulk quantum field in the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "we note that this is the result of direct calculation of ordinary qft in ds space and does not invoke any analytic continuation from an ads calculation .",
    "we will discuss the relation to ds / cft in more detail below .",
    "the values for which the square root is real are called the complementary series of representations , while those for which the real part is fixed at @xmath39 while the imaginary part varies , are the principal series . at the level of the two - point function",
    "we could view the usual scalar fluctuation as determined by the correlator of @xmath40 , which makes sense even for the complex operators of the principle series . however , there is no consistent interpretation of the 3 point function of principal series operators , except to set the various complex 3 point functions to zero .",
    "thus , in order to have an interpretation as fluctuations of the real quantity @xmath41 , we must restrict attention to the complementary series .",
    "thus @xmath42 is bounded between @xmath43 and @xmath39 .",
    "conventional slow - roll models have @xmath44 .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , this is not in the list of unitary representations , but is a limit of them .",
    "we believe that this is a consequence of the logarithmic behavior of massless minimally coupled propagators in ds space , which may make the definition of the global symmetry generators a bit delicate . from the point of view of phenomenology",
    ", this subtlety is irrelevant .",
    "@xmath1 invariance is only an approximate property of inflationary models and we can certainly consider arbitrarily small values of @xmath42 , so the distinction between zero and other values could never be determined from the data .",
    "our point is that the representation constant of the field fixes its two and 3 point functions up to pre - factors .",
    "the two - point function of such a field is fixed , up to a multiplicative constant to be @xmath45 = c^s_2 ( x^{\\mu } y_{\\mu } ) ^{- 2 \\delta_s } .\\ ] ] here @xmath46 can be any @xmath1 invariant density matrix .",
    "the flat slicing of ds space is @xmath47 using the asymptotic relation between the flat coordinates and the light cone , we find a momentum space correlator ( in radial momentum space coordinates ) @xmath48    similarly , the 3 point function is determined to be @xmath49   = c_3 \\prod_{ij } x_{ij}^{\\frac{-\\delta_s}{2 } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 this form follows from @xmath1 , the scaling symmetry , and symmetry under permutations of the points .",
    "the latter symmetry follows from the assumption that the operators commute with each other . in both hst and a conventional slow - roll model ,",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the different points are causally disconnected during inflation , and that we are computing an expectation value at fixed time . in the hst model ,",
    "@xmath1 invariance sets in via a coupling together of dof at different points , using a time dependent hamiltonian , which approaches a generator of @xmath1 when the number of e - folds is large .",
    "maldacena and pimentel@xcite , among others @xcite , have shown how all of the @xmath32 point functions are determined up to 3 normalizations by @xmath1 group theory .",
    "similar results were obtained by mcfadden , skenderis and collaborators@xcite .",
    "our results for correlation functions of tensor modes have to coincide with theirs because the only representation of @xmath1 that has the right number of components to represent the transverse traceless graviton fluctuation is the class iv representation ( in the notation of newton@xcite ) with @xmath51 .",
    "the casimir operators have the values @xmath52 . the class @xmath53 representations are the two different helicity modes of the graviton .",
    "see appendix b for details of the classification of @xmath1 representations .",
    "note however that the coefficients in front of these group theoretic predictions are different in slow - roll and hst models . in slow - roll models , both scalar and tensor fluctuations",
    "are computed as two - point functions of quantum fields in the background space - time @xmath10 , while in hst , the magnitude of the fluctuations is determined by a fixed hubble parameter @xmath54 , as we will review below .",
    "two interesting points about the pure tensor 3-point functions were made by @xcite and by maldacena and pimentel . in bulk field theory computations",
    ", the parity violating term allowed by group theory does not appear in correlation functions .",
    "the corresponding term in the logarithm of the wd wave function is purely imaginary and does not contribute to correlators of operators that are simply functionals of the fields appearing in the wave functional .",
    "neither the tensor nor scalar operators involve functional derivatives acting on the wave functional , and so their correlators are insensitive to this term .",
    "in addition , one of the two parity conserving structures only appears if we allow higher derivative terms in the bulk action . in a more general @xmath1 invariant theory ,",
    "the vanishing of the parity violating term might follow from an underlying reflection invariance of the microscopic dynamics , while there is no reason for the two parity conserving terms to have very different normalizations .",
    "in general , knowledge of the parity operation on the fields , plus the fact that the fields commute with each other , _ does not _ imply that the parity operator commutes with the fields .",
    "rather , it is like a permutation operator , which permutes the elements of a complete ortho - normal basis .",
    "the properties of parity imply that it squares to a multiple of the unit operator . in the conventional approach to slow - roll inflation models ,",
    "the hilbert space is interpreted as the thermo - field double of field theory in a single causal patch and the state is taken to be the bunch - davies state , which reproduces thermal correlation functions in the theory of the causal patch .",
    "this state is invariant under a @xmath55 which reverses both the orientation of the 3-sphere and the time in the causal patch .",
    "when combined with the tcp invariance of bulk quantum field theory , this leads to parity invariant correlation functions .",
    "another way of seeing the same result is to note that the wd density matrix for the bunch - davies vacuum , is diagonal in the same basis as the fields whose expectation values we are computing .",
    "the parity operation is defined as complex conjugation of the wd wave function , and leaves the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix invariant .",
    "these are the only matrix elements relevant to calculating these particular expectation values .    in the hi model of inflation , thermal fluctuations in _ many _ initially decoupled ds causal patches are coupled together by a time dependent hamiltonian , which , in the limit of a large number of e - folds , approaches a generator of @xmath1 . in this limit , one can argue that the density matrix should become approximately @xmath1 invariant , but we do not see a general argument that it be parity invariant . similarly , there is no reason for the density matrix to be diagonal in the same basis as the fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the three sphere .",
    "the parity operation acts simply on the fields , but not necessarily on the density matrix .",
    "_ consequently , there is no argument that the parity violating part of the tensor 3 point function must vanish , or be small compared to the other two terms .",
    "_ thus , the tensor bispectrum may be the only clear discriminant between slow - roll inflation and a general class of @xmath1 invariant models that includes hi .",
    "the group theory analysis does not determine the scaling dimension @xmath58 or the coefficients of the various two- and three - point functions .",
    "in the next section , we review the holographic inflation ( hi ) model , which makes predictions for some of these unknown constants .",
    "note however , that maldacena , using the bulk effective field theory description of fluctuations , has derived several relations between the nine parameters on quite general grounds .",
    "the fundamental gauge invariant measure of scalar fluctuations is the scalar metric perturbation @xmath41 , where @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath60transverse and traceless .",
    "when @xmath61 is constant , this is just a rescaling of the spatial frw coordinates so its effect is completely determined .",
    "thus , in a three - point function including @xmath41 , which depends on three momentum vectors satisfying the triangle condition @xmath62 , the squeezed limit where the @xmath63 of @xmath41 is taken to zero , is completely determined by the coordinate transformation of the corresponding two - point function . since @xmath1 fixes the momentum dependence of all @xmath32 point functions up to a multiplicative constant , the constants in the @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 three - point functions , are determined by those in the @xmath67 , and @xmath68 two - point functions .",
    "this leads to the prediction of small non - gaussianity in the slow - roll limit , and reduces our @xmath2 constants to @xmath7 .",
    "we have argued that the hst model does have a description in terms of coarse grained classical field theory , and so should obey maldacena s constraint .",
    "slow - roll inflation models determine the magnitudes of fluctuations in terms of the quantum fluctuations of canonically normalized free fields in the bunch - davies state . in the single field",
    "slow - roll models , this leads to an exact relation between the scalar and tensor tilts and the normalizations of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 correlators .",
    "the hi model does not lead to this relation .",
    "however , the relative orders of magnitude of the scalar and tensor two - point functions are determined by very general geometrical considerations .",
    "the quantity @xmath41is shown in appendix a of@xcite to satisfy @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the proper time displacement between two infinitesimally separated co - moving hypersurfaces , and @xmath73 the homogeneous hubble radius .",
    "this requires only that the metric be locally frw , that the cosmological fluid have vanishing vorticity , and that fluctuations away from homogeneity and isotropy are treated to first order . on the other hand , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the local fluctuation in the hubble parameter .",
    "if the metric is close to ds then @xmath76 is small .",
    "@xmath75 is the fluctuation in the inverse radius of space - time scalar curvature , while the tensor fluctuations are fluctuations in the spin two part of the curvature , which is defined intrinsically by the fact that the background is spatially flat .",
    "thus , we can conclude quite generally that the fluctuations in @xmath75 and in the spin two piece should be of the same order of magnitude . in section 3 we will recall that in the hi model , general statistical arguments indicate that these fluctuations have the magnitude @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the radius of the approximate ds space .",
    "we want to emphasize that apart from the last remark , these are purely classical geometrical considerations . adopting jacobson s point of view about einstein s equations , we can say that any quantum theory of gravity whose local hydrodynamics looks like ds space for a sufficiently long period , will give predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations that are qualitatively similar to those of slow - roll inflation .",
    "we will discuss the observational discrimination between different models below .",
    "the scalar two - point function is given at large times in the flat slicing by @xmath79 in slow - roll models , the relevant value of @xmath80 , at which to evaluate this formula , depends on @xmath81 via the equation @xmath82 notice that in these formulae we ve reverted to the use of @xmath78 for the constant inflationary ds radius , while @xmath54 is the varying hubble parameter . in a general model , @xmath54",
    "will be decreasing with time and @xmath83 will be increasing , as inflation ends .    modes with higher @xmath81 leave the horizon at a later time and so the normalization @xmath84 will be smaller for these modes .",
    "however , there is another effect coming from the fact that @xmath42 is positive .",
    "as inflation ends , @xmath85 is not increasing as rapidly as the exponential so @xmath86 increases as @xmath80 increases ( we neglect the variation of @xmath10 in the horizon crossing formula , because it is not in the exponential ) .",
    "thus , the logarithmic derivative of the correlation function will have a negative contribution from the prefactor and a positive one proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "since both effects depend on the slow variation of @xmath54 , the tilt will be small ( remember that @xmath87 is bounded by unitarity ) , but its sign depends on the value of @xmath42 .",
    "the slow - roll result of red tilt is obtained for small @xmath42 , but near the unitarity bound the tilt could be of either sign , depending on the behavior of @xmath10 . the conventional slow - roll model usually assumes @xmath88 .",
    "similar remarks apply to the tensor fluctuations",
    ". however , the overall constant in these is not in general fixed in terms of the normalization of the scalar two - point function , as it is in a conventional slow - roll model .",
    "if we ever measure the tensor fluctuations , we will be able to see whether the slow - roll consistency condition , relating the magnitudes and tilts of tensor and scalar two - point functions is satisfied .",
    "thus far , we ve compared slow - roll inflation to a general model satisfying only approximate @xmath1 invariance of the density matrix , and the existence of an approximately de sitter classical background geometry @xmath10 .",

    "it is exactly homogeneous and isotropic at all times , despite the fact that the initial state is random and the hamiltonian is a fast scrambler .",
    "although it corresponds to a coarse grained effective geometry , the model contains no local excitations around that background .",

    "thus , the role of inflation in the holographic inflation model is precisely to generate localized fluctuations , by starting the system off in a state where commuting copies of the same dof are in different quantum states , from the point of view of the central observer .",
    "below , we will map these commuting copies to different points on a fuzzy 3-sphere , so that the fluctuations in their quantum states become local inhomogeneities of the 3-sphere .",
    "these are , in our model , the origin of the cmb fluctuations , and they provide the raison d^ etre for localized excitations of the ultimate @xmath155 space .",
    "one might say that the most probable path between the @xmath15 geometry and @xmath155 is the homogeneous model described in the previous paragraph . by forcing the universe to go through a state where tensor factors of its hilbert space are decoupled",
    ", the inflation model chooses a less probable , though more interesting , path .    in the model",

    "that quantum system is not even approximately a queft , at least at the beginning of inflation , when the fluctuations are actually generated .",
    "the fluctuations calculated from the density matrix of the underlying model are inserted into the classical space - time equations of the theft , as fluctuations of the metric , in the co - moving gauge for the inflaton .    in a more realistic model",
    ", we would have to make a transition from @xmath171 to the hamiltonian of a geodesic observer in @xmath155 .",
    "the latter hamiltonian describes particles , and we would have to show how the fluctuations in the inflaton get transmuted into distributions of photons and matter .",

    "we know perfectly well how to build a queft of this era , by coupling the classical inhomogeneous inflaton field to quantum fields describing particles .",
    "it s basically the challenge of describing the particle physics in terms of hst that is beyond our reach at present .",
    "there are however , a few remarks that we can make .",
    "the first is that the conventional matter and radiation dominated eras lead to an increase in the radius of the horizon by an amount @xmath175 , with @xmath176 a parameter strictly less than , but of order , @xmath177 .",
    "the fact that @xmath176 is less than one follows from the general properties of asymptotically ds cosmologies which are not exactly ds , while the fact that it s of order one reflects the very recent crossover between matter and radiation domination .",
    "thus , we should take @xmath178 .      in order to construct a model , which is effectively local in a 3 dimensional space",
    ", we label the @xmath179 variables in the following manner .",
    "the geometry seen by an observer at the end of inflation is a 3-sphere of radius @xmath180 .",
    "we have of order @xmath181 degrees of freedom , which can be thought of holographically as living on the holographic screen of a causal diamond , with radius @xmath182 , when the number of e - foldings is large",
    ". we will distribute these  uniformly \" over a fuzzy 3-sphere of radius @xmath183 .",
    "a 3-hemisphere can be thought of as a fiber bundle with two - sphere fibers , over the interval @xmath184 $ ] .",
    "the two - sphere at angle @xmath185 has a radius @xmath186 .",
    "the hst version of this geometry is a collection of variables @xmath187 where the matrix at @xmath188 is @xmath189 with @xmath190 we take @xmath191 , while @xmath192 the @xmath188 are equally spaced in angle along the interval . since each @xmath193",
    ", we can construct , for each two sphere , a basis of spinor spherical harmonics localized on the faces of a truncated - icosahedral , geodesic tiling of the sphere , obtaining an approximately local description of our hemi-3-sphere .",
    "this tiling scheme is shown in figure [ tile ] .",
    "the centers of the faces , combined with the discretized interval parametrized by @xmath188 define a lattice on the 3 sphere .",
    "our spinor variables @xmath194 have a natural action of @xmath195 acting separately on the rows and columns of the matrix .",
    "we combine this with the discrete @xmath196 rotations which take points of the lattice into each other .",
    "as @xmath100 we can construct operators which turn our unitary representation of @xmath18 into a unitary representation of @xmath196 .",
    "in addition , we argued in @xcite that , in the limit , we could construct operators @xmath197 which extend this to a unitary representation of @xmath1 .",
    "we thus conjectured that the hilbert space of the localized variables @xmath198 admits an action of @xmath1 , in the limit @xmath100 , and that it can be described in terms of field operators @xmath199 transforming covariantly under the action of @xmath1 on the 3-sphere , as we assumed in the previous section .",
    "_ we have argued that they do not obey the axioms of conventional euclidean cft . in particular , the hilbert space admits an infinite dimensional unitary representation of @xmath1 which can not be highest weight ( there are no highest weight unitary representations ) .",

    "our results for the correlation functions of inflationary fluctuations depended on the assumption that the state of the system after inflation is invariant , but not on the particular choice of invariant state . _ note that the operators @xmath200 representing the local fluctuations commute at different points , because they probe properties of the individual , originally non - interacting , horizon volumes .",
    "we work in the schrodinger picture , in which the density matrix , rather than the operators , evolve .",
    "the preceding paragraph described mathematics .",
    "we incorporate it into the physics of our inflationary universe in the following way .",
    "we have followed the universe using the rules of hst from its inception until a time when the particle horizon had a size @xmath138 . at that time , a very large number of observers have hilbert spaces of entropy @xmath164 and are described by identical states and hamiltonians .",
    "the individual hamiltonian is that of a non - integrable , cutoff @xmath131 dimensional field theory whose evolution , time averaged over several e - foldings , produces a maximally uncertain density matrix .",
    "this description extends out from a central point on the lattice of observers for a distance @xmath201 , up to the surface that will eventually be our cosmological horizon .",
    "points on the lattice of observers that are more than @xmath138 steps apart , have no overlap conditions .",
    "we make a coarser sublattice , consisting of centers of tilted cubes on the original lattice , whose hilbert spaces have no overlaps .",
    "we now want to describe the hamiltonian of the central observer , from the time that individual points on the coarse sublattice thermalize , until the end of inflation .",
    "we will _ not _ provide a complete hst description of this era , because it is currently beyond our powers .    to construct this hamiltonian ,",
    "we begin with the hilbert space of entropy @xmath181 described above , and identify points in the coarse lattice of hst observers , with points on the fuzzy 3-sphere described above .",
    "the central observer is identified with the point @xmath202 on the interval .",
    "there is no sense in further localizing it on the fuzzy two sphere at that point , because the state in its hilbert space is varying randomly over a hilbert space of entropy @xmath164 .",
    "there are no localized observables at length scales smaller than @xmath138 .",
    "we think of this geometrically as saying that the area of the hexagon centered at this observer s position has area @xmath164 .",
    "each point on the 3-spherical lattice has , at the beginning of this era , an identical wave function in a hilbert space of entropy @xmath164 .",
    "the time dependent hamiltonian of the central observer now begins to couple together points on the spherical lattice , in a manner consistent with causality .",
    "that is , as the proper time of the central observer increases , we assume that its causal diamond increases in area , and the hamiltonian couples together points that are closest to it on the 3-sphere , in accordance with the covariant entropy bound . in principle , the rate , in proper time , at which the area of the holographic screen grows , tells us about the frw background geometry .",
    "the jacobsonian effective field theory of this is a model of gravity coupled to a scalar , with a potential that leads to @xmath203 e - folds of inflation , and a rapid transition to @xmath155 .",
    "we are dealing with only a single observer , and do not have overlap constraints to guide us , so we could incorporate any geometry consistent with the entropy bounds .",
    "the rate at which different points on the sphere are coupled together is not connected to the rate of change of the state according to the local hamiltonian , which is randomizing individual hilbert spaces of entropy @xmath164 .",
    "_ therefore there will be local fluctuations of the initial quantum state at different points on the 3-sphere_. this is the physical origin of the fluctuations whose form we described in the previous section . above , we have argued that when @xmath204 they are approximately gaussian and estimated their magnitude .",
    "they should clearly be thought of as statistical fluctuations in the quantum state , rather than quantum fluctuations in a pure state .",
    "of course , since we detect these fluctuations in properties of a macroscopic system , there is no way that one could have ever detected the quantum nature of fluctuations in the conventional inflationary picture , but the point of principle is significant . in a more realistic model , these fluctuations would be the origin of what we observe in the cmb and the clumpy distribution of matter around us .",
    "we construct our model so that , by the time the size of the holographic screen has reached @xmath156 , the hamiltonian of the dof in that diamond is the generator @xmath171 , which approaches an element of the @xmath1 lie algebra in the ( fictitious ) limit @xmath100 .",
    "the system is characterized by a density matrix , because the state of each point on the fuzzy 3-sphere is random , and the times at which different points become coupled together are not locked in unison .",
    "note however that the initial time averaged density matrices at each point _ are _ identical , by construction , and are exactly @xmath18 invariant .",
    "it is extremely plausible that the density matrix is approximately @xmath1 invariant when @xmath203 is large .",
    "this is our principal assumption .",
    "the  lattice spacing \" on our 3-sphere is of order @xmath205",
    "so corrections to @xmath1 invariance are , plausibly , exponentially small .",
    "note that we are free to construct a model for which this is true .",
    "the only constraint on model building in hst ( apart from those we are clearly satisfying ) comes from the overlap rules .",
    "we are not , of course , implementing the overlap rules in this paper , but we see no reason why they should be incompatible with approximate @xmath1 invariance of a single observer s density matrix .",
    "it s important to realize that @xmath1 invariance of the density matrix does not imply exact ds invariance of the universe , as described by its theft .",
    "the density matrix is a probability distribution for fluctuations and the theft is the result of classical evolution starting from typical initial conditions .",
    "this is , of course , exactly as in conventional inflation models .",
    "also , the fact that , in the underlying hi model , all degrees of freedom are in interaction , means that inflation is ending , so even the homogeneous background should be moving away from its ds form .",
    "we have argued that the form of primordial fluctuations , which has been derived to leading order in slow - roll parameters for a slow - roll inflation model with the assumption of the bunch - davies vacuum ( see appendix a for an argument that this assumption is a fine tuning of massive proportions ) , in fact follows from a much less restrictive set of assumptions .",
    "these are @xmath1 invariance and approximate gaussianity , plus a particular choice for the @xmath1 representations for the operator representing scalar fluctuations .",
    "this choice , plus @xmath206 normalizations for the different two- and three - point functions , determine the fluctuations uniquely .",
    "in slow - roll models , these normalizations depend on parameters in the slow - roll potential , while gaussianity is a prediction of the model and the leading non - gaussian amplitude is suppressed by a power of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "we have noted that the dominance of scalar over tensor two - point fluctuations is a general consequence of cosmological perturbation theory for near de sitter backgrounds , and the assumption that the scalar and tensor components of the curvature have similar intrinsic fluctuations ( as they do in both slow - roll and hi models ) .",
    "maldacena s squeezed limit theorem , combined with @xmath1 invariance , determines all three - point functions involving scalars in terms of the scalar and tensor two - point functions .",
    "we ve also reviewed the hst model of inflation presented in @xcite .",
    "it predicts approximately gaussian and @xmath1 invariant fluctuations , robustly and without assumptions about the initial state .",
    "like all hst cosmologies it is completely finite and quantum mechanical .",
    "@xmath1 invariance follows from the assumption that evolution with the @xmath171 generator of an initially @xmath18 invariant density matrix will lead to an @xmath1 invariant density matrix after a large number of e - foldings .",
    "the number of e - foldings is not a completely independent parameter , but is bounded by the ratio between the inflationary and final values of the hubble radius .",
    "if we require that we have enough entropy in the system at the end of inflation to account for the cmb fluctuations , then @xmath207 in order to leave room for the subluminal expansion of conventional cosmology , we should not be near the lower bound .    in the slow - roll models , the small deviation from the  scale invariant \" predictions @xmath208",
    "is explained by the slow - roll condition . a similar argument for a general @xmath1 symmetric model ( and in particular the hi model ) follows from the fact that the parameter @xmath58 labeling the scalar fluctuations is bounded , @xmath209 , by unitarity of the representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of the hst model guarantees that the effective bulk geometry , constructed from local thermodynamics following the prescription of jacobson , goes through a period of inflation , which ends .",
    "we do not yet have an hst description of reheating , and the era of cosmology dominated by particle physics .",
    "the dominance of the scalar over tensor fluctuations , the smallness of non - gaussianity involving the scalar , and the fact that the scalar and tensor tilt are both small , all follow from the fact that @xmath210 is small and that @xmath58 is bounded . at the level of two - point functions , the only relation that distinguishes conventional slow - roll inflation ( including hybrid inflation models ) from generic ds invariant quantum theory is the precise relation between the normalizations and tilts of the scalar and tensor fluctuations and the fact that the hi model predicts vanishing tensor tilt . depending on the precise form of @xmath10 , there may be a critical value of @xmath42 for which the scalar tilt shifts from red to blue",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether further investigation of hst models can predict that the scalar tilt is red . at our present level of understanding ,",
    "the scalar tilt is a competition between a blue tilt induced by choosing a  massive \" representation for @xmath42 and a red tilt induced by the conventional normalization of fluctuations .",
    "we do not have an _ a priori _ argument for which of these dominates , or even whether there are different models where either can dominate .    at the level of non - gaussian fluctuations , things are a bit more interesting .",
    "slow - roll models with lagrangians containing only the minimal number of derivative terms give rise to only one of the three possible @xmath1 covariant forms for the triple tensor correlation function .",
    "even if we include higher derivatives , we can not get the parity violating form .",
    "thus , observation of the purely tensor bispectrum could tell us whether we were seeing conventional slow roll , or merely a generic model with approximate @xmath1 symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", the parity violating amplitude might be forbidden in general by a discrete symmetry of the hi model . at the moment , we do not see an argument , which would require such a symmetry .",
    "we also want to emphasize that the inflation literature is replete with models which give the standard predictions for two - point functions , but predict three - point functions which are far from @xmath1 invariant . in these models ,",
    "maldacena s squeezed limit theorem does not imply that the scalar three - point function is small everywhere in momentum space . according to our current understanding , observation of a large scalar 3 point function , could rule out all models based on @xmath1 symmetry , and might point to some non - vanilla , queft based inflation model .",
    "our considerations imply that so long as observations remain consistent with some slow - roll inflation model , they will not distinguish a particular model among the rather large class we have discussed without also observing tensor fluctuations .",
    "the only observations that are likely to validate the idea of a queft with bunch - davies fluctuations of quantum fields are a precise validation of the single field slow - roll relation between two - point functions , or a measurement of the tensor three - point function . on",
    "the other hand , observations that validate non - standard inflationary models , like dbi inflation , or show evidence for iso - curvature fluctuations , could rule out the general framework discussed in this paper . while it is possible that hst models can be generalized to include iso - curvature fluctuations , this is not in the spirit of those models .",
    "the key principle of hst cosmologies is that the very early universe is in a maximally mixed state , which is constantly changing as new dof enter the horizon .",
    "the model of @xcite , was designed to be the minimal deviation from such a maximal entropy cosmology , which allowed for a period in which localized excitations decouple from the bulk of the degrees of freedom on the horizon .",
    "a model with more structure during the inflationary era would introduce questions like  why was this necessary ? \" , which could at best be justified ( though it seems unlikely ) by anthropic considerations .    to conclude , we want to re - iterate a few basic points .",
    "conventional inflation appears fine tuned because of what is usually called the trans - planckian problem ( appendix a ) .",
    "a generic state of the dof that queft buries in the extreme uv modes of the inflationary patch , has no reason to evolve to the bunch - davies state .",
    "moreover if we accept the idea that local patches of ds space become completely thermalized within a few e - foldings , and that the generic state has no localized excitations , then it does not really make sense to treat its dynamics by queft . in @xcite",
    "we proposed a model that preserves causality , unitarity , the covariant entropy bound , and which , with no fine tuning of initial conditions , leads to a coarse grained space - time description as a flat frw model with a large number of e - folds of inflation .",
    "the model produces a nearly gaussian spectrum of almost - desitter invariant scalar and tensor metric fluctuations .",
    "the model can be matched to a slow - roll queft model ( with a different space - time metric ) at the level of scalar fluctuations , but predicts no tensor tilt and , in the absence of an explicitly imposed symmetry , would have all three invariant forms of the tensor three - point function with roughly equal weights .",
    "inflation was originally invented to solve a number of initial condition problems in the standard theory of the big bang , among them the horizon and flatness problems .",
    "the horizon problem was originally stated as  why is the universe homogeneous and isotropic shortly after the big bang , when different regions have not been in causal contact ? \" , but also includes the question  how can the cmb in parts of the sky with angular separation of order @xmath211 be correlated , since these represent degrees of freedom that were never in causal contact ? \"",
    "the conventional inflationary answer to these questions is that everything we see in the universe today  originated in a tiny inflationary patch of size a few times the inflationary hubble radius \" .",
    "the way this works in qft is that field modes localized in regions much smaller than the planck scale , get blown up to the size of our current horizon , or larger , during the inflationary era .",
    "this fact was emphasized in a large number of papers written in the early part of the 21st century@xcite , and is known as the _ transplanckian mode problem_. the conventional inflationary argument for dealing with these modes , whose initial description is outside the realm of validity of effective field theory , invokes the adiabatic theorem . if those modes are in their ground state initially , then the adiabatic theorem guarantees that they will adiabatically evolve to the bunch - davies state when they become long wavelength enough to be treated by effective field theory .",
    "this argument makes two crucial assumptions .",
    "the first is the way in which the true theory of quantum gravity reduces to queft .",
    "that is , it assumes all of the mysterious modes , which show up as transplanckian field modes in the queft treatment , are indeed high energy modes of the quantum hamiltonian , and there is a gap between their adiabatic ground state and the next excited state .",
    "this is simply untrue in the hst model of quantum gravity , but one could assume hst is wrong , and that the real theory of quantum gravity will obey the adiabatic argument .",
    "the second assumption is however an admission of fine tuning worse than those that inflation was supposed to solve .",
    "any model of inflation that purports to explain the correlations in the cmb fluctuations , must have a hilbert space of dimension at least @xmath212 .",
    "the dimension of the space of field theory states in a single horizon volume , which do not back - react on the metric and cause the creation of a horizon filling black hole is at most @xmath213 , where @xmath81 is a constant of order @xmath177 and @xmath138 is the inflationary hubble scale in planck units .",
    "the vast bulk of the hilbert space required to explain the cmb can not be modeled by field theory in a single @xmath153 horizon volume .",
    "to claim that the initial state is  the unique adiabatic ground state \" is a ridiculous fine tuning , even if the hamiltonian of quantum gravity had the gap that is assumed in the adiabatic argument .",
    "generic states of large quantum systems lie in a quasi continuum of closely spaced chaotic levels .",
    "this is the property that makes statistical mechanics work .",
    "adiabatic arguments for the detailed quantum state are never valid , though there are often collective variables which do evolve adiabatically .",
    "the collective variables are typically classical because they re averages over many degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic problem here is that the naive inflation idea that everything came from a few inflationary hubble volumes , an inflationary hubble time after the initial singularity , violates the covariant entropy bound .",
    "the causal diamonds of observers on that time - slice are too small to encompass the states of the observable cmb .",
    "field theory performs the miracle of inflation by sucking up degrees of freedom from the extreme uv , but no theory of quantum gravity , which obeys the ceb , can do the same .",
    "what we re arguing in this appendix is that there is no magic universality argument by which inflation can capture the unknown dynamics of the non - field theoretic dof and reach the conclusion that the bunch davies state is the state the universe is drawn to .",
    "note that there is no contradiction here with the claim that the b - d vacuum is a good approximate description of eternal ds space .",
    "if one accepts the contention of banks and fischler that ds space is a quantum system with a finite number of states@xcite , then many of the properties of bd follow from the principles of statistical mechanics@xcite , and some mild assumptions about the hamiltonian .",
    "tb has presented this argument about fine tuning in conventional inflation at a number of conferences since 2007 , and it has been greeted with a great deal of skepticism .",
    "much of that had to do with the belief that the conventional theory of inflation had been verified by observation of the cmb . in this paper",
    "we ve shown that , to a large extent , those predictions follow from symmetries and the rather natural assumption that fluctuations are small and approximately gaussian .",
    "the holographic inflation model in fact predicts both of those two facts in a simple manner , and does not suffer from any fine tuning of initial conditions .",
    "an independent argument that it is invalid to treat the inflationary era in the queft approximation , comes from a somewhat more holographic perspective .",
    "everyone would agree that after a few e - folds of inflation , any given horizon volume of the universe looks like empty de sitter space .",
    "this is indeed the most naive argument , within queft , for assuming the bunch - davies state .",
    "however , a horizon volume of empty ds space is a highly entropic system , with an entropy that can not be understood in terms of localized excitations in the bulk of the horizon volume .",
    "if we indeed want our model of inflation to resemble a collection of decoupled horizon volumes of ds space , then we should not model its fluctuations on those of localized degrees of freedom in a horizon volume .",
    "the hst model of inflation indeed models the local dof as a generic thermalized system , with the right entropy and no intra - horizon locality .",
    "locality on super - ds - horizon scales comes from our explicit construction of a hamiltonian based on the geometry of a fuzzy 3-sphere , to couple together the individual horizon volumes .",
    "we had originally imagined some sort of duality between the hst description and the conventional queft description , with a uv cutoff at the ds - horizon scale . however , when we realized that most of the predictions could be understood without queft , and without the assumption of the bunch - davies state , and that our detailed predictions for the magnitude of fluctuations differed from those of queft , we abandoned this idea .",
    "our current thinking is that the standard approach reproduces the data , only because it obeys the symmetry principles described in this paper .",
    "here we wish to remind the reader of the classification@xcite of the unitary representations of @xmath1 by labeling representations of the group according to their eigenvalues of the invariant casimir operators . to start , we review by constructing elements of the algebra @xmath214 explicitly , wherein we can separate the elements into a 6-dimensional sub algebra of rotations in @xmath215 and 4  boosts , \" which we interpret as rotations in the plane of one of the directions @xmath216 and the  time \" coordinate , @xmath80 , in 5d minkowski space .",

    "we label these angular momentum eigenvalues with @xmath232 and @xmath233 for each respective casimir invariant @xmath234 where here the @xmath235 labels the unitary sub - algebras .",

    "then , we can arrive at a set of linear equations relating matrix valued functions of @xmath232 and @xmath233 by examining the action of the  boosts \" via their commutation relations with the generators of the @xmath231 sub - algebras .",
    "finally , we solve a set of recurrence relations to find the general forms of the matrix valued functions of @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
