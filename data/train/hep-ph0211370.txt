    "the measurement of the top quark mass at fermilab in 1995 @xcite completed a search that started nearly a hundred years ago with the measurement of the electron mass .",
    "although neutrino masses still remain to be accurately measured , we already have the most important pieces of the puzzle of fermion masses . a satisfactory theory to explain the standard model ( sm ) fermion masses , however , is still lacking .",
    "the disparity in the mass scales of the third generation fermions and the first and second generation fermions , as well as their mixing angles , suggest that different mechanisms may be responsible for the masses of third generation , and first and second generation fermions .",
    "indeed , an explanation of third generation fermion masses may be necessary to understand first and second generation fermion masses .",
    "it is widely hoped that fermion masses and mixing angles will be explained , or at least reduced , by some grand unified theory ( gut)@xcite . in this case , to obtain predictions for the values of masses , gauge couplings and mixing angles , the predictions for the boundary conditions of the unified theory at the gut scale would be extended , using the renormalization group equations , from the unification scale down to the electroweak scale . the current grand unified theories , however , reduce the number of parameters",
    "but they do not make definite predictions for the yukawa couplings at the unification scale .",
    "these couplings must be fit to the experimental measurements .",
    "this approach has been extensively used in the literature to study third generation fermion masses in the context of supersymmetric grand unified models ( susy guts ) @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the unification scale yukawa couplings can be adjusted to fit the measured top , bottom and tau fermion masses  @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative idea , not incompatible with the previous approach , which can make unified theories more predictive .",
    "if the renormalization group equations describing the evolution of the various couplings in the theory possess an infrared fixed point , then some of these couplings could be swept towards this fixed point @xcite . m.  lanzagorta and g.g .",
    "ross @xcite have pointed out that the fixed point structure of the unified theory beyond the standard model may play a very important role in the determination of the yukawa couplings at the gauge unification scale .",
    "it was argued that the evolution towards the fixed point may occur more rapidly in some unified theories than in the low - energy theory due to their larger field content and the possible lack of asymptotic freedom .",
    "therefore , even though the `` distance '' between the grand unification scale and the planck scale ( or the compactification scale ) is much less than the distance between the electroweak scale and the grand unification scale , the unified fixed point could play a significant role in determining the couplings at the unification scale , regardless of their values in the underlying  theory of everything . \"",
    "this possibility would make the unified theory much more predictive because the yukawa couplings at the unification scale may be determined in terms of the unified gauge coupling according to the unified gauge group and the multiplet content of the model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the possibility that the third generation fermion masses are determined by the fixed point structure of the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) model .",
    "we will not analyze here whether or not nature can reach a fixed point at the unification scale , because ultimately that analysis depends on assumptions about the still unknown physics at yet higher energy scales , perhaps at the planck scale .",
    "instead , we will adopt a phenomenological approach : we will assume that at the unification scale the su(5 ) model is at a fixed point , and we will study the low - energy implications of our assumption .",
    "we will not address here the problems that afflict the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) model : namely , the doublet - triplet splitting problem , the strong experimental constraints on proton decay , the generation of neutrino masses , and the lack of predictivity in the flavor sector .",
    "solutions have been proposed for each of these problems , and entail complicating the minimal su(5 ) model @xcite . since our aim is to explore a new idea , in this paper we will use the smallest simple group in which one can embed the standard model gauge group : the minimal third - generation supersymmetric su(5 ) model .",
    "we think that the idea can be extended to non minimal grand unified models , where the problems that afflict minimal su(5 ) may find a resolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] with the calculation of the fixed points for the yukawa sector of the model .",
    "we find only one phenomenologically interesting fixed point and analyze its mass predictions , first by neglecting low - energy supersymmetric thresholds . in sec .",

    "[ sec4 ] we study the fixed point implications for the breaking of the su(5 ) symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we study the characteristic low - energy supersymmetric spectra predicted by the fixed point . in sec .  [ sec6 ] we study the fermion mass predictions including the low - energy supersymmetric thresholds . here",
    ", we also analyze the dependence of the predictions on the unified gaugino mass and on the sign of the @xmath3-term . in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] we briefly analyze the fixed point predictions for fermion masses in the context of non minimal su(5 ) models with additional particle content .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] with a brief summary of our results .",
    "we begin our calculation of one - loop fixed points with a brief review of the model to set up our conventions and notation .",
    "the superpotential of the minimal one - generation supersymmetric su(5 ) model , omitting su(5 ) indices , is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are matter chiral superfields belonging to representations * 10 * and @xmath7 of su(5 ) , respectively .",
    "as in the supersymmetric generalization of the standard model , to generate fermion masses we need two sets of higgs superfields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , belonging to representations * 5 * and @xmath7 of su(5 ) .",
    "the higgs superfield in the adjoint * 24 * -dimensional representation , @xmath10 , is chosen to allow the existence of a realistic breaking of the su(5 ) symmetry down to the sm group , @xmath11 .",
    "typically , fixed points appear for ratios of couplings , such as ratios of yukawa couplings to gauge couplings , and are known generically as pendleton - ross fixed points .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the su(5 ) yukawa couplings , valid above the gut scale , are given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the matrix transpose , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the rge for the su(5 ) unified gauge coupling is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 in the minimal model .",
    "the rges for the ratios of yukawa couplings to the unified gauge coupling can be easily calculated from eqs .",

    "to solve the problems afflicting the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) model , extended non minimal models have been examined . for instance , it is known that one can fit the first and second generation standard model fermion masses and mixing angles , in the context of grand unified models , by adding extra matter to generate yukawa textures at the gut scale .",
    "many of these extensions contain extra particle content , suggesting modifications to the minimal su(5 ) fixed point predictions . nonetheless , even though the evolution towards the yukawa unified fixed point may occur more rapidly as a result of increased particle content , the fixed point for the soft parameters would become unstable if the added particle content were too large .",
    "for extensions of the minimal model , eq .",
    "( [ su5yukgaurge ] ) applies with the modification @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the sum of dynkin indices of the additional fields @xcite .",
    "we are lacking a complete non minimal model for the soft sector and therefore do not know exactly the upper bound on @xmath21 imposed by soft stability .",
    "a na \" i ve estimation , however , could be made based on eq .",
    "( [ su5trilrge ] ) .",
    ", as a function of the dynkin index .",
    "the value @xmath22 corresponds to minimal supersymmetric su(5).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the fixed point solution for the yukawa couplings in general non minimal models with extra particle content is given by @xmath23 in principle @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 , which is a good prediction since we overcome more easily the constraints on proton decay .",
    "although we can not make precise predictions for bottom and top masses , we can estimate , without a complete model of the soft sector of the non minimal model , how the extra particle content affects the mass predictions without including supersymmetric thresholds .",
    "following the procedure used in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we study the prediction for the top and bottom mass as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : su5nomin ] . for @xmath22",
    ", we recover the minimal su(5 ) predictions .",
    "the bottom mass prediction decreases from @xmath26  gev for @xmath22 to @xmath27  gev for @xmath28 , while the top mass increases from @xmath29  gev to @xmath30  gev .",
    "surprisingly , the effect of the extra matter is not so important as we expected at first sight from eq .",
    "( [ su5fpnomin ] ) . we see that for @xmath22 the fixed point predicts @xmath31 , while for @xmath28 it predicts @xmath32 , representing a @xmath33 increase in the gut scale inital condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the top mass prediction increases only by @xmath34 while the bottom mass decreases by @xmath35 .",
    "this effect is combined with a change in @xmath2 when we increase the particle content .",
    "the reason is that when the tau yukawa coupling grows , @xmath2 , which we compute using the tau mass , also increases .",
    "the bottom mass is especially affected , compensating for the increase in the bottom yukawa coupling . even though these conclusions are interesting , they must be considered preliminary , since non minimal models imply additional couplings , which affect the rges and can modify these predictions .",
    "furthermore , we can not include supersymmetric thresholds without a complete non minimal model for the soft sector .",
    "it seems , from our numerical results , that the su(5 ) fixed point predictions , mainly the top quark mass , are more stable than one might have expected .",
    "the stability of these results could indicate the presence of fixed point behavior in the running of the mssm yukawa couplings from the gut to the @xmath36 scale . in the mssm",
    ", there is a fixed point viable at large @xmath2 .",
    "the mssm large @xmath2 fixed point predicts that @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the infrared .",
    "the relevance of this fixed point in the context of top  bottom  tau unified models was pointed out in ref .",
    "the large @xmath2 fixed point in the mssm must not be confused with the low @xmath2 fixed point .",
    "even though the low @xmath2 fixed point has been much more studied in the literature @xcite , it is not relevant in the context of top - bottom - tau yukawa unified models as it predicts that the bottom and tau yukawa couplings are zero , while top - bottom unified models require that the top and bottom yukawa couplings are of the same order at low energies .",
    "on the other hand , we think that even though the large @xmath2 fixed point of the mssm can be relevant in the su(5 ) fixed point scenario , it is not predictive enough by itself to explain the measured third generation fermion masses , since it predicts that the tau yukawa coupling is zero .",
    "in this paper we have outlined a precise analysis of the low - energy implications of a supersymmetric su(5 ) fixed point .",
    "it is well known that supersymmetric grand unified theories predict correctly the weak mixing angle .",
    "this unified fixed point in addition predicts successfully the top quark mass without adjustments to any model parameter .",
    "this is , to my knowledge , the most successful prediction of the top mass in the literature based on first principles and implies that @xmath39  gev is a number encoded in the symmetries of the supersymmetric su(5 ) model .",
    "other interesting predictions of the unified fixed point studied in this paper are    * the bottom mass , which is in general sensitive to the sign of @xmath3 and to the gaugino unified mass , approaches its experimental value for @xmath40 and very large values of the gaugino mass ; * the weak mixing angle is correctly predicted for low values of the gaugino unified mass , as is characteristic of other supersymmetric unified models , and can be successfully predicted for large values of the gaugino unified mass .",
    "if the successful prediction of the weak mixing angle and the bottom mass ( for very large gaugino unified mass ) is more than a coincidence , it could be a hint that the mass scale of all supersymmetric particles lies well above 1 tev .",
    "furthermore , a very heavy susy spectrum would make other indirect supersymmetric signals unobservable in current experiments .",
    "the results found in this work may be regarded as evidence for supersymmetry with grand unification , especially as grand unification provides a simple and elegant explanation of the standard model gauge structure and representation content .",
