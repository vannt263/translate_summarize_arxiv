    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an attractive candidate for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its local version , supergravity , leads to various phenomena in cosmology .",
    "in particular , when the inflaton dominates the universe during and after inflation , the supergravity effect induces an effective mass of order @xmath5 , the hubble expansion rate , for a general scalar field @xmath0 coupled to the inflaton sector by planck - suppressed interactions  @xcite , unless its mass is protected by some symmetry .",
    "such an effective mass of order @xmath5 is called a _ hubble - induced mass _ and plays an important role in many cosmological scenarios .",
    "for example , a negative hubble - induced mass enables the affleck - dine baryogenesis mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the enhanced hubble - induced mass also is a key for solving the cosmological moduli problem  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the hubble - induced mass will be a main obstacle for implementing the curvaton mechanism  @xcite in supergravity and it must be suppressed at least by about one order of magnitude .",
    "there have been arguments about whether or not such an effective mass of order @xmath5 arises during the radiation - dominated ( rd ) era after reheating  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was claimed that the effective mass for @xmath0 , which is coupled to thermal plasma through planck - suppressed interactions , is suppressed by the ratio of the zero - temperature mass of the particles in the plasma and the plasma temperature , and therefore it is much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "however , the dispersion relation of the thermalized particles was not correctly included in ref .",
    "recently , two of the present authors ( mk and tt ) have applied the technique of thermal field theory to this issue and found that the effective mass of the order of @xmath5 for @xmath0 does arise even in rd era  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective mass squared of @xmath0 was expressed in terms of the thermal expectation value of the kinetic term of the coupled ( scalar or fermion ) field in the thermal bath . here , the thermalized fields were implicitly assumed to be gauge singlets .",
    "then , the thermal expectation value was evaluated based on thermal field theory . however , the procedure given in ref .",
    "@xcite would become complicated if we considered all the contributions to the effective mass of @xmath0 from a realistic thermal bath consisting of the susy sm particles .",
    "this is because the thermal expectation values of the gauge covariant kinetic terms would have to be evaluated .    in this paper",
    ", we use a different strategy for evaluating the effective mass of @xmath0 .",
    "our observation is as follows : the evaluation will become simple and transparent , if we use the nature of supersymmetry before applying the thermal field theoretic calculation .",
    "namely , we first rescale the chiral superfields so that the @xmath0-dependence is absorbed into yukawa and gauge couplings",
    ". this enables us to read off the effective mass term for @xmath0 from the free energy calculated with the rescaled couplings .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic evaluation of the effective mass of @xmath0 and show an example calculation with the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) plasma . as a first estimate , we give a complete analytic expression for the leading order ( in terms of couplings ) contribution to the effective mass of @xmath0 .",

    "one of the attractive solutions is the adiabatic solution  @xcite ; if the modulus field receives an enhanced hubble - induced mass - squared , @xmath151 , it follows the time - dependent minimum and as a result , its abundance is suppressed by a power of the ratio of the zero - temperature modulus mass and the inflation scale  @xcite . the origin of such enhanced hubble - induced mass may be due to a cut - off scale one order of magnitude lower than the planck scale  @xcite , or some strong dynamics at the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "our findings show that , even if the couplings between the modulus and the mssm sector are enhanced by two orders of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath152 , the hubble - induced mass for the modulus is not sufficient to suppress the modulus abundance when it starts to oscillate after reheating .",
