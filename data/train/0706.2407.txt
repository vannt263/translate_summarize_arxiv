    "in this report , we answer two questions concerning measurement of atomic parity violation ( apv ) in hydrogen and deuterium . first , given the current level of tests of the standard model ( sm ) , how well would parity violation need to be measured in hydrogen and deuterium to make a useful contribution to this body of data ?",
    "second , what experimental parameters are needed to achieve the required precision ?    as to the first question , there exists a long list of impressive experimental tests of the sm @xcite , many involving large collaborations in high energy physics .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ theory ] , future progress may , in part , require additional high - precision , low - energy measurements@xcite , and in this regime , experiments in hydrogen have the advantage that the atomic structure is known to high precision and would not limit the theoretical interpretation .",
    "another advantage of parity experiments in hydrogen is that all of the electron - nucleon , weak - neutral - current couplings can be determined by performing measurements at several level crossings in both h and d. this point is discussed in section [ mixing ] where we present updated sm predictions for the parity violation mixings at the various crossings .",
    "a summary of the results of former pnc measurements in hydrogen is presented in section [ currentlimits ] , and in sections [ sensitivity ] , and [ systematics ] we consider our question concerning the experimental requirements by evaluating a generic apv experiment in deuterium .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ summary ] .",
    "testing the sm of the electroweak interaction remains an important task of experimental physics .",
    "this effort has reached the level of precision measurements .",
    "for example , the weak mixing angle @xmath7 has been determined to 0.06% at the z boson mass .",
    "most of the data confirming the sm have been obtained at high energy near the z resonance .",
    "the excellent agreement at the z - pole was obtained by the weighted average of two experiments that disagree with one another by 3.4 @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , there have been recent measurements at lower energy , such as the muon g-2 experiment @xcite , the nutev neutrino deep inelastic scattering experiment@xcite , and the slac e-158 polarized mller scattering experiment @xcite . in the muon g - factor experiment there is a 3.4 standard deviation difference between the experimental result and the theoretical calculation@xcite suggesting new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this situation has motivated additional low energy measurements of the electroweak interactions , such as the qweak @xcite and dis - parity @xcite experiments at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "a useful way to assess the low energy tests of the electroweak interaction is to consider the predicted running of weak mixing angle @xmath9 .",
    "the sm predicts that this parameter evolves as a function of momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "this evolution can be checked by performing precision low energy experiments and comparing the results with precise measurements at high energy . in this respect , tests done near zero momentum transfer such as apv or low energy electron scattering experiments are ideal . in the @xmath10 scheme ,",
    "erler and ramsey - musolf @xcite find for the value of the weak mixing angle at zero momentum transfer : @xmath11 in the same scheme the value at the z - pole is @xcite : @xmath12 so that the zero momentum transfer value is larger by about 3% .",
    "several low energy measurements test this prediction .",
    "apv ( cs@xcite and tl@xcite ) establishes the running of weak mixing angle with a 0.9% measurement of @xmath13 that is one standard deviation below the sm prediction .",
    "the e-158 mller scattering experiment has an error of 0.6% which is one sigma above the sm .",
    "nutev , a deep inelastic neutrino scattering experiment , reports a 3@xmath8 discrepancy with the sm value .",
    "the qweak experiment aims to improve the limits on the semi - leptonic weak neutral current couplings by measuring the weak charge of the proton q@xmath14(p ) . in lowest order the weak charge",
    "is given by@xcite : @xmath15 since @xmath9 is close to 1/4 , @xmath16 is suppressed and particularly sensitive to higher order corrections and new physics beyond the sm .    to be more precise",
    ", we can use the sm expressions for the electron - hadron processes from ref .",
    "@xcite , including radiative corrections , to derive the relation between the uncertainties in the weak charge @xmath17 and @xmath13 for an atom with nuclear charge @xmath18 and neutron number @xmath19 .",
    "we find : @xmath20 for h , d , and cs the factors multiplying @xmath21 are -0.078 , 1.00 , and 1.45 , respectively .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath16 with a precision of 4% determines @xmath1 to 0.3% . for the boulder cs experiment ,",
    "if the experimental error ( @xmath22 ) @xcite and atomic theory error ( @xmath23 ) are combined in quadrature , the total uncertainty in @xmath24 is @xmath25 which corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath26 in @xmath1 based on eq .",
    "[ qfactor ] , and this is the dominant contribution to the current apv limit on @xmath1 . for deuterium , eq .",
    "[ qfactor ] indicates that the fractional uncertainty in @xmath27 is equal to the fractional uncertainty in @xmath1 .",
    "the need for precision measurements of semileptonic weak neutral current couplings at low momentum transfer obliges a renewed consideration of measurements in hydrogen and deuterium where precision is not limited by calculational uncertainties . in this respect , both the heavy atom apv experiments and polarized electron scattering experiments are susceptible to hadronic or atomic effects .",
    "qweak aims to measure the parity violating elastic electron - proton scattering asymmetry at @xmath28 @xmath29 0.03 gev@xmath30 .",
    "this process is proportional to the sum of @xmath31(p ) and a proton form factor @xmath32(@xmath33 ) .",
    "the form factor contribution must be subtracted from the scattering asymmetry in order to extract @xmath31(p ) . in principle , this extrapolation would require a hadronic structure calculation , but an extensive series of parity violating electron - proton scattering experiments at higher @xmath28 will allow extrapolation to @xmath28=0 with an uncertainty of about 2% in the weak charge@xcite .",
    "the heavy atom apv experiments require sophisticated atomic theory calculations in order to extract the weak charge from the experimental results . in the case of cs ,",
    "the atomic structure uncertainty is currently about 0.5% . to go beyond this in heavy atoms",
    "probably requires measuring apv for a series of isotopes of an atom and forming ratios of the results .",
    "these ratios determine @xmath31 and are less sensitive to calculational uncertainties .",
    "however , this procedure is subject to other uncertainties arising from variations in neutron distributions along the chain , which will limit the ultimate precision@xcite .",
    "apart from the potential of a precision measurement of @xmath1 and sensitivity to new physics , experiments in hydrogen and deuterium provide the opportunity to determine all four of the electron - nucleon , weak - neutral - current coupling constants : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath34 are the nuclear spin independent couplings for the proton and neutron .",
    "( note that @xmath36 @xcite . )",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath35 are the nuclear spin dependent couplings .",
    "these four parameters are important because they are basic properties of the neutron and proton .",
    "the constants for the neutron can be obtained by comparing results from hydrogen and deuterium experiments . for deuterium",
    "we use the notation @xcite : @xmath37 in terms of the quark coupling constants @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the proton and deuteron couplings have the values@xcite : @xmath42 the constants @xmath2 and @xmath0 can be determined from apv experiments with little strong interaction uncertainty . by contrast ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 involve considerable strong interaction uncertainty , as has been discussed by a number of authors@xcite",
    ".    in table  [ limits ] we give experimental and theoretical values for these couplings .",
    "the experimental numbers in column 2 are based on a `` model - independent fit '' to all neutral current parameters which are presented in table 10.8 of ref .",
    "the fit allowed for an arbitrary electroweak gauge theory .",
    "the final column of table  [ limits ] gives the sm predictions based on eq .",
    "[ quarks ] , table 10.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath43 .",
    "theoretical corrections from the anapole @xcite and strange quark @xcite contributions are not included .",
    "all of the couplings except @xmath0 are suppressed in the standard model . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 the suppression arises because they are proportional to @xmath44 in lowest order .",
    "the coupling @xmath4 vanishes exactly in lowest order and the small residual value is entirely due to higher order corrections , so this parameter is quite sensitive to these corrections .",
    "although @xmath0 has been determined ( indirectly ) to about 3% , the uncertainty in @xmath2 is comparable to the size of the sm prediction , and both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are undetermined .",
    "an attractive goal for a future apv experiment would be a 0.3% measurement of the nuclear spin independent coupling for the deuteron @xmath0 .",
    "this would determine @xmath45(0 ) with a combined error ( theoretical + experimental ) of 0.3% which is a factor of three improvement on the limit provided by the heavy atom apv experiments .",
    "this is comparable to the limit on @xmath45(0 ) expected from the qweak experiment , but would provide complementary information on the isospin dependence of the e - nucleon electroweak couplings @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the nuclear spin independent coupling in hydrogen at the same level of absolute precision would provide a 4% measurement of @xmath2 , which together with a measurement of @xmath0 would provide a constraint on the isospin dependence of the nuclear - spin - independent weak - neutral - current interaction with one experimental setup . for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , measurements with absolute precisions similar to a 0.3% measurement of @xmath0 could provide the first determinations of these quantities with an error of 3% for @xmath3 and 20% for @xmath4 .",

    "all of the hydrogen apv experiments were based on fast ( @xmath49 500 ev ) beams of metastable hydrogen atoms and aimed to measure @xmath3 .",

    "the experiments searched for a parity violating ( pseudoscalar ) interference term between a@xmath57 and a@xmath84 in the transition rate , that changed sign as the `` handedness '' of the interaction region was switched .",
    "the main differences among the various schemes were in the configurations of fields in the interaction regions , and the pseudoscalars of interest .",
    "particularly significant is that in the michigan experiment , a@xmath84 and a@xmath57 were driven simultaneously in a single microwave cavity , while in the yale and u. washington experiments , separate oscillating field regions were used for a@xmath57 and a@xmath84 .",

    "[ limits ] , we see that the value expected based on the standard model is c@xmath61= 0.036 .",
    "so the statistical error is a factor of 40 larger than the expected effect while the systematic error is 600 times larger than the expected effect .",

    "the conclusions of this paper do not rest on this particular scheme , as there are many other possibilities which would have roughly the same sensitivity .",
    "rather , we chose this example after considering some general guidelines for a future h / d parity experiment .",
    "first , in comparison to the original h apv experiments , the signal - to - noise - ratio s / n has to be improved by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "then , to improve handling of systematic effects , it is important to have precise control over the alignment of the apparatus and all applied fields . to make this less daunting",
    ", the apparatus should be simple  a few homogeneous applied fields is preferred over more complicated configurations .",
    "perturbations of the beam due to surfaces ( apertures , walls , etc . ) should be minimized , and all surfaces should be kept as far from the beam as possible .",
    "the apparatus should be `` clean '' @xmath97 surfaces should be carefully prepared to minimize stray electric fields , and ultra - high vacuum techniques should be used .",
    "the beam density should be as low as possible consistent with the needed intensity and there should be no charged particles , or field configurations which tend to trap charged particles .    one can increase s / n by developing a more intense metastable beam .",
