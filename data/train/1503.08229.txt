    "using superconductors as active components in spintronics devices is a research field that has attracted increasing activity in recent years @xcite .",
    "such a synergy becomes possible both due to the special behavior of spin - polarized quasiparticles in superconductors , featuring extremely long spin lifetimes and spin relaxation lengths @xcite , and because superconducting cooper pairs can become spin - polarized @xcite .",
    "this type of cooper pairs occur not only in superconductors with intrinsic triplet pairing , such as uge@xmath1 @xcite and its cousins urhge and ucoge @xcite , but can in fact be artificially engineered in hybrid structures between conventional superconductors and magnetic materials @xcite . for samples with substantial impurity scattering , which is the experimentally most common scenario ,",
    "these triplet cooper pairs acquire a special property known as odd - frequency symmetry @xcite in order to satisfy the pauli principle .",
    "what this means is while the cooper pair wavefunction is symmetric under both an exchange of space- and spin - coordinates , it is antisymmetric under an exchange of time - coordinates .",
    "this property leads to remarkable features such as gapless superconductivity @xcite , anomalous meissner effects @xcite , and the possibility to create spin - supercurrents in diffusive ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that paramagnetic meissner effects and zero - bias conductance peaks can also originate from other types of effects which are not related to unconventional superconductivity , as shown previously in the context of @xmath2-wave superconductivity in the cuprates @xcite and more recently for topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the quality of the materials and avoiding crashing the stm tip into the sample are of paramount importance for proper identification of unusual types of superconductivity such as the odd - frequency one mentioned above .    in the context of utilizing superconductors for spintronics purposes ,",
    "the possibility of spin - supercurrents in ferromagnetic materials @xcite has earned the triplet cooper pairs much attention .",
    "it is known that in structures featuring inhomogeneous magnetic order , such as intrinsically textured ferromagnets like ho @xcite , or multilayers with several ferromagnets @xcite , triplet supercurrents can arise even when using conventional @xmath3-wave superconductors which feature spinless cooper pairs .",
    "however , it can be difficult practically to control the magnetization direction of each of the individual layers when using complex structures as in ref .",
    "@xcite to create the spin - supercurrent . a large amount of works",
    "have studied how triplet supercurrents can arise in various types of structures including both weakly and strongly polarized ferromagnets ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "however , it would be highly desirable to create a spin - supercurrent flowing in a _",
    "normal ( non - magnetic ) _ metal with a minimum amount of magnetic elements required due to the ensuing simplification in how to control the existence , and the properties , of the spin - supercurrent .",
    "now , it was recently experimentally shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that by using magnetic insulators ( mi ) in a superconducting spin - valve setup , it was possible to control the superconducting critical temperature @xmath4 by changing the relative magnetization configuration from parallel ( p ) to antiparallel ( ap ) by application of an external field , causing an essentially infinite magnetoresistance effect .",
    "this finding prompted us to pose the question : what happens when magnetic insulators are used in a josephson junction that has a normal , non - magnetic metal as its weak link ?",
    "can this create a spin - polarized dissipationless flow and , if so , can such a spin - supercurrent be controlled externally ?",
    "we here demonstrate that the presence of magnetic insulators in a josephson junction offers an interesting way to create a conserved spin - supercurrent in a normal metal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "this spin - flow is controlled with the relative misalignment angle between the magnetic insulators .",
    "a main advantage with this setup , compared to previous proposals using ferromagnets , is that the magnetic configuration is easily tunable since the magnetization of one single very thin ( 1 - 2 nm ) magnetic insulator needs to be altered .",
    "moreover , the spin - supercurrent is carried by odd - frequency cooper pairs which leave a clear spectroscopic fingerprint in the density of states .",
    "we show that by tuning the superconducting phase difference @xmath5 , one can qualitatively change the nature of the proximity effect from a conventional singlet one to a triplet one _ in situ_. we also show that the presence of magnetic insulators not only creates a spin - supercurrent , but that it has important consequences for the quantum phase of the system which undergoes a dynamic 0-@xmath0 transition for a single sample by changing from a p to ap configuration for the insulators .",
    "we use the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite in the diffusive limit , where the physics is described by the green matrix function @xmath6 of the system which is an 8@xmath78 matrix in keldysh - nambu space .",
    "it is defined in terms of the retarded , advanced , and keldysh part of the green function : @xmath8 in the absence of non - equilibrium effects , such as applied voltages and temperature - gradients , it is sufficient to consider the retarded part @xmath9 , which may be parametrized conveniently as follows @xcite : @xmath10 we have defined @xmath11 for normalization and the @xmath12 operation means complex conjugation and reversal of quasiparticle energy .",
    "the ricatti - matrices @xmath13 are 2@xmath72 matrices in spin space and the green function @xmath14 satisfies the usadel equation @xcite in the normal metal @xmath15=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 is the diffusion coefficient of the normal metal , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the quasiparticle energy measured relative the fermi level . in order to account for the magnetic insulators at the interfaces , we use spin - dependent boundary conditions discussed in ref .",
    "the most important effect of the magnetic insulators is the spin - dependent phase - shifts experienced by quasiparticles scattering at the interface , which are described by a parameter @xmath19 to be defined below .",
    "the superconducting regions are described by bulk green functions which for the left and right side of the junction are denoted @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "we have introduced @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the bulk solution is an excellent approximation for low interface transparencies when using large superconducting reservoirs .",
    "we have used the second pauli matrix @xmath26 , and the superconducting phase difference across the junction is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "the boundary conditions read : @xmath28 + \\i g_\\varphi^l[\\mathcal{m}_l , g ] \\text { at } x=0,\\notag\\\\ 2 d \\zeta_rg \\partial_x g = [ g , g_r ] - \\i g_\\varphi^r[\\mathcal{m}_r , g ] \\text { at } x = d,\\notag\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the ratio between the normal - state barrier resistance on side @xmath30 and the resistance of the normal metal , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transmission probability for channel @xmath33 and d@xmath34 are the spin - dependent part of the phase - shifts picked up by particles scattered at the interface . finally , the matrix @xmath35 describes the orientation of the magnetic moment of the magnetic insulator on side @xmath30 , while @xmath2 is the length of the normal metal .",
    "experimentally , it is likely that the magnetic insulators will have exchange fields lying in the plane perpendicular to the tunneling direction due to shape anisotropy if one uses a layered pancake geometry for the junction .",
    "this case , and other configurations , are covered by us setting the right interface to @xmath36 whereas the left interface is allowed to have an arbitrary orientation , i.e. @xmath37 . here , @xmath38 is the azimuthal angle in the @xmath39-plane and @xmath40 is the angle between the magnetization and the @xmath41-axis . for later use ,",
    "we define the magnetic moments of the insulators on the left and right side as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the boundary conditions used here can also be extended @xcite to include a magnetoresistance term @xmath44 which accounts for the different transmission probabilities for spin-@xmath45 and spin-@xmath46 particles .",
    "inclusion of such a term amounts mainly to an overall reduction of the superconducting proximity effect and we have explicitly verified numerically that the spin - supercurrent exists even in its presence . the magnetic moment associated with each magnetic insulator should be understood as the net average moment of the interface region , since a disordered interface might have an internal magnetic structure .",
    "moreover , interfaces in hybrid structures are intrinsically accompanied by the lack of inversion symmetry . for this reason",
    ", spin - orbit effects could arise at the interface and modify the spin - dependent scattering at the superconducting interface @xcite .",
    "however , it is currently unknown how to incorporate such interfacial spin - orbit scattering in the boundary conditions of quasiclassical theory .",
    "nevertheless , even if such a mechanism existed , the spin - dependent phase - shifts due to the magnetic insulators captured by the parameter @xmath19 in our work is sufficient to produce triplet cooper pairs , and so we do not expect that a second mechanism that accomplishes the same thing ( due to spin - orbit interaction ) would bring about any major changes .",
    "finally , we will later on include non - ideal effects such as spin - flip scattering due to magnetic impurities and spin - orbit impurity scattering to see how they influence the spin- and charge - flow as well as the density of states in the system .",
    "these are accounted for @xcite by adding extra self - energy terms in the commutator part of the usadel equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : usadel ] ) : @xmath47 here we have defined the matrix vector @xmath48 , where the components are given by : @xmath49 for future reference , we introduce the normalized strength of magnetic impurity and spin - orbit scattering as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 are the relaxation times associated with each type of scattering .",
    "we proceed to discuss how the charge- and spin - supercurrents sustained by the system are influenced by the presence of the ferromagnetic insulators . in the quasiclassical framework ,",
    "these are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the density of states at the fermi - level in the normal - state , @xmath56 is the electric charge , @xmath57 is the reduced planck constant , while @xmath58 is the interface contact area . for future use , we also define the bulk superconducting coherence length @xmath59 . in the weak proximity effect regime",
    ", we were able to find a general analytical result for the supercurrents of spin and charge ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "we first briefly consider the charge - supercurrent which reads : @xmath60 where the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 are lengthy expressions that depend on junction parameters such as the width @xmath2 , misalignment angle @xmath40 , temperature @xmath63 , and the interface transparencies @xmath64 .",
    "the charge - current is found to be independent of which orientation the magnetic moments have in the @xmath39-plane , @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the presence of magnetic insulators coupled to the superconductors introduces a @xmath65-dependence on the supercurrent , not only tuning its overall magnitude , but also changing the quantum ground - state of the junction from 0 to @xmath0 when @xmath66 thus , 0-@xmath0 transitions can now occur even with a normal metal interlayer by changing @xmath40 , a feature which was also reported in the ballistic limit in ref .",
    "@xcite . to demonstrate that this is a robust feature ,",
    "we have computed the charge supercurrent without any assumption of a weak proximity effect , thus using the full riccati parametrization .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](d ) , where the current changes sign at @xmath67 corresponding to the 0-@xmath0 transition .",
    "further information may be inferred from the analytical expression for the charge - supercurrent in the appendix , eq .",
    "( [ eq : charge ] ) : as the width @xmath2 of the junction increases , larger values for the spin - dependent phase - shifts @xmath19 are required in order to make the 0-@xmath0 transition possible .",
    "nm and the relative temperature @xmath68 .",
    "the interface parameters are set to be equal , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the phase difference is the one supporting the critical current , @xmath71 . in ( a ) ,",
    "we have set @xmath72 nm , @xmath73 . in ( b ) , we have @xmath74 nm and @xmath75 . in ( c ) , we set @xmath72 nm and @xmath75 . as expected , the components of the spin - supercurrents are mirror - images of each other in ( b ) and ( c ) due to the choice of magnetic configuration of the insulators , @xmath75 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) ] .",
    "the charge - supercurrent is independent of @xmath38 .",
    "as seen , it changes sign when going from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , signalling a 0-@xmath0 transition . the normalization constant of the charge - current is @xmath78 while for the spin - currents it is @xmath79 .",
    "the contour plot in the bottom panel ( d ) is the charge - supercurrent in the @xmath5-@xmath40 plane using @xmath72 nm , showing the occurrence of the 0-@xmath0 transition around @xmath67 ( the dark green region corresponds to the @xmath0-phase ) . ]",
    "interestingly , there exists not only a superflow of charge in the system , _ but also of spin_. the polarization occurs in the direction @xmath80 , and so we find that while @xmath81 , one has : @xmath82 eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) is one of the main results of this work .",
    "it is seen that the spin - supercurrent vanishes if one only has one magnetic insulator , in which case @xmath83 or @xmath84 is zero . moreover , it is proportional to @xmath85 , which shows that it is also absent in the p or ap alignment @xmath86 . for other angles",
    "@xmath40 , however , it is in general present .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 are purely real and vanish in the absence of superconductivity ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "there exists a simple relation between the components of the spin - supercurrent in the @xmath39-plane : @xmath89 this spin - supercurrent has several remarkable features : first of all , it is conserved throughout the normal metal just like the charge - current .",
    "secondly , it is long - ranged as it flows through a normal metal without any exchange field .",
    "thirdly , it has one component that is _ independent _ of the superconducting phase difference @xmath5 .",
    "the other component goes like @xmath90 , meaning that the total spin - supercurrent satisfies @xmath91 .",
    "this can be understood physically , since a spin - current is invariant under time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the latter operation transforms @xmath92 and causes the charge - supercurrent to change sign . in the appendix",
    ", we give the full expression of the spin - supercurrents including the coefficients and their dependence on the junction parameters . the spin - supercurrent vs. misalignment angle @xmath40",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](a)-(c ) for different junction parameters .",
    "the spin - supercurrent should be possible to control with a weak external field coupling to the magnetic insulators , tuning their relative orientation .",
    "we underline that our structure , unlike previous works , does not include any ferromagnetic metals .",
    "in fact , a conceptually similar experimental structure to the one that we propose to use in our manuscript has recently been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , the authors investigated a spin - valve structure consisting of a superconductor flanked by two magnetic insulators of slightly different thicknesses ( both of order a few nm ) .",
    "applying an external magnetic field would then control the magnetization orientation of the thinner of these layers .",
    "this indicates that our results are of experimental relevance using currently available techniques .    in an experimental setting",
    ", the normal metal sample may well include some degree of magnetic impurities or spin - orbit scattering on impurities .",
    "thus , it is of interest to see how such non - ideal effects influence the predictions made in this paper .",
    "although no tractable analytical expression is accessible in this case , we have computed numerically the charge- and spin - supercurrent in the presence of spin - flip scattering and spin - orbit impurity scattering as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : flip ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the dissipationless flow of charge and spin are affected very differently depending on the type of scattering .",
    "consider first the charge - supercurrent [ top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : current_flip ] ] . with increasing spin - flip scattering ,",
    "the current is monotonically suppressed .",
    "however , this is not the case for spin - orbit impurity scattering ( middle panel ) .",
    "instead , the 0-@xmath0 transition point vanishes and the current retains its order of magnitude even for very large values of @xmath93 . turning to the spin - supercurrent , we find that both magnetic impurity scattering and spin - orbit impurity scattering suppress the spin - flow monotonically .    the physical origin of the different behavior of the charge- and spin - supercurrents when adding magnetic impurities and spin - orbit scattering can be traced back to how the singlet and triplet superconducting correlations are affected by them @xcite .",
    "it can be demonstrated analytically that the singlet component is insensitive to spin - orbit impurity scattering in the absence of a magnetic field , as is reasonable since spin - orbit scattering respects time - reversal symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the triplet component is suppressed as the spin - orbit scattering rate increases .",
    "based on this , one can now understand why the charge - supercurrent evolves different with increasing spin - flip and spin - orbit scattering respectively . in the former case ,",
    "both the singlet and triplet components are suppressed , i.e. the total superconducting proximity effect is reduced , and the current simply decays montonically . in the latter case , however , only the triplet part is suppressed . with only the singlet",
    "part remaining in the normal metal , there is no mechanism to cause a 0-@xmath0 transition and the sign of the current remains positive and still of appreciable magnitude .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied to the spin - current . in this case",
    ", it is solely the triplet part which is responsible for its existence . since both magnetic impurities and spin - orbit scattering",
    "suppress the triplet cooper pairs , the spin - supercurrent decays monotonically as the scattering rate increases .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : current_flip ] that the dependence of the spin - supercurrent on the misalignment angle @xmath40 between the magnetic insulator moments goes toward a pure @xmath85 profile as @xmath93 becomes large .",

    "it has previously been shown that a crossover from pure conventional even - frequency pairing to odd - frequency pairing is made possible via spin - active interfaces in s@xmath99mi@xmath99n bilayer junctions @xcite .",
    "the pivotal parameter is the ratio between the spin - dependent phase - shifts and the normal - state tunnel conductance , in our notation @xmath19 , which causes a pure odd - frequency proximity pairing state at the fermi level ( @xmath100 ) when @xmath101 while a pure even - frequency state occurs when @xmath102 .",
    "experimentally , this is manifested as a large zero - energy peak in the density of states when the odd - frequency triplets dominate .",
    "conversely , a minigap appears in the spectrum for conventional singlet pairing . to observe such an effect",
    ", it would be necessary to fabricate several samples with a varying ratio @xmath19 .",
    "one way to accomplish this could be to vary the width of the mi interlayer in order to tune the tunneling probability .    instead",
    ", we here show that when spin - active interfaces are incorporated in a josephson junction geometry , the crossover from even- to odd - frequency pairing can now be controlled by the _ superconducting phase difference _ @xmath5 , which in turn is determined by the current flowing through the system .",
    "this offers a new way to induce a triplet proximity effect which can be changed _ in situ _ within a single sample , simply by varying @xmath5 .",

    "however , instead of monotonically closing the minigap as @xmath5 is driven towards @xmath0 , the density of states becomes strongly enhanced at low energies .",
    "this feature arises due to the odd - frequency symmetry of the triplet cooper pairs in the normal metal @xcite . when the spin - active scattering , taking place at the insulators , becomes stronger in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](b ) and ( c ) , the minigap has vanished all - together , leaving behind only a clear zero - energy peak in the density of states .    the qualitative change in the density of states ( going from fully suppressed to enhanced at low energies )",

    "[ fig : dos2 ] : as one changes from a p to ap configuration ( going from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) , the system makes a transition from hosting proximity - induced triplet superconductivity to singlet superconductivity .",
    "our work thus demonstrates a _ conversion between singlet and triplet cooper pairs in a normal metal by tuning either the superconducting phase difference or the configuration of the magnetic insulators_. this has the important advantage that it can be done _ in situ _ , as opposed to using ferromagnets where _ e.g. _",
    "several samples with different widths are created to suppress the singlet component relative the triplet one .",

    "it should also be noted that the spectroscopic fingerprints of the superconducting proximity effect are much more sensitive toward the presence of magnetic impurity and spin - orbit scattering than the charge- and spin - supercurrents , the former being suppressed in magnitude faster compared to the current at a given value of @xmath111 .",
    "we here discuss in more detail how our work is related to previous findings . in the proposal by houzet and buzdin @xcite ,",
    "a ferromagnetic trilayer was suggested as the minimal structure that would be able to generate a long - ranged triplet supercurrent . in another work by grein _",
