    "random walks and the associated diffusion equation are at the heart of quantitative descriptions of a large number of physical systems @xcite . despite such ubiquity , random walk dynamics has limitations , and does not apply to cases where collective dynamics , extended heterogeneities , and other sources of long - range correlations lead to so - called _ anomalous dynamics _ @xcite . to describe these situations , various generalizations of brownian motion have been conceived , generally covered under the rubric of _ fractional dynamics _ @xcite .",
    "for example , a quite useful model of _ super - diffusive _ behavior , in which the spread of the distribution grows faster than linearly in time , is provided by lvy flights : particles are assumed to perform random jumps with step lengths taken from a distribution that decays as a power law .",
    "if the variance of the jump length is infinite , the central limit theorem does not apply @xcite , and the dynamics is anomalous .",
    "lvy flights , which are dominated by rare but etremely large jumps , have proven quite suitable in modeling many physical systems , ranging from turbulent fluids to contaminant transport in fractured rocks , from chaotic dynamics to disordered quantum ensembles @xcite .",
    "while the concentration @xmath1 of particles performing brownian motion follows the standard diffusion equation , @xmath2 , the concentration of lvy flights satisfies a _ fractional diffusion equation _ in which the laplacian operator is replaced by a _",
    "fractional derivative _ as @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ fde ] ) , @xmath4 is the riesz ",
    "feller derivative of fractional order @xmath5 @xcite , which has an integral representation involving a singular kernel of power - law form ( see appendix [ riesz derivatives ] ) .",
    "for diffusing particles , the index @xmath6 roughly characterizes the degree of fractality of the environment , and is in this context restricted to @xmath7 ; for @xmath8 , the correlations decay sufficiently fast for the central limit theorem to hold , and eq .",
    "( [ fde ] ) is replaced by the regular diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same riesz ",
    "feller derivative also appears in connection with stochastically growing surfaces @xcite . in this case , the evolution of the height @xmath9 of the interface is usually written in langevin form @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents uncorrelated noise of zero mean , and with @xmath12 .",

    "other physical systems , such as slowly growing films in molecular beam epitaxy , are better described by a restoring force that depends on curvature , with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "better understanding of the properties of the fractional derivative is thus relevant to many physical systems . when the domain over which the operator @xmath4 acts is unbounded , the fractional derivative has a simple definition in terms of its fourier transform @xmath16 more precisely , @xmath4 is a pseudo - differential operator , whose action on a sufficiently well - behaved function is defined through its symbol @xmath17 .",

    "we investigate the fractional laplacian on a bounded @xmath22-@xmath23 domain with various bc on the two sides of the interval .",
    "in particular , we shall study absorbing and free bc : the former naturally arise in the context of lvy flights in connection to first - passage problems @xcite , while the latter arise in the context of long - ranged elastic interfaces with no constraints at the ends @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ fractional laplacian ] we recast eqs .",

    "( [ fde ] ) may be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 with the appropriate bc on @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath30 also corresponds to the inverse of the time constant with which the associated eigenfunction @xmath26 decays in time .",

    "( [ problem ] ) with different bc is awkward and not completely understood : for absorbing bc it has been proven that the operator @xmath0 on a bounded domain admits a discrete spectrum of eigenfunctions and that the corresponding eigenvalues are all real and negative and can be ordered so that @xmath34 . however , the exact values of the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions are not known and remain an open question ( see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is nonetheless both possible and interesting to investigate the properties of the fractional laplacian numerically , and at least two major approaches exist for this purpose .",
    "the first approach consists in implementing the continuum operator in eq .",
    "( [ problem ] ) with a finite differences scheme .",
    "this is the so - called grnwald - letnikov scheme , whose construction is directly based on the integral representation of the fractional laplacian operator @xcite . considerable insight on the behavior of solutions to the fractional diffusion equation on unbounded domains is obtained by this method , and it has been shown to be highly accurate .",
    "however , due to some technical difficulties , it can not be straightforwardly extended to take into account bc @xcite .",
    "another finite element approach to discretization of this continuum operator is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second approach is intrinsically probabilistic in nature and consists in replacing continuous lvy flights representing @xmath4 with a discrete hops on a lattice : a transition probability matrix @xmath35 is constructed , whose elements represent the probability of performing a jump from position @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "analogous to lvy flights , the jump probability has a power - law tail which after normalization reads @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "for this reason , this process has also been referred to as a riemann random walk @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath40 , is supposed to converge to the representation of the continuum operator when its size goes to infinity .",
    "bc can be taken into account by properly setting the probabilities for jumps leading out of the domain .",
    "this approach , however , has some shortcomings : first , the convergence of the discretized matrix to the continuum operator largely deteriorates as @xmath41 , i.e. when approaching the regular laplacian @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is strictly limited to the range @xmath42 $ ] , due to its probabilistic underpinnings .",
    "= 9.0 cm    our approach is the following : we are interested in representing the action of the operator in terms of a matrix @xmath43 such that the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath43 converge to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator when the size @xmath44 of the matrix goes to infinity .",
    "we start with the fourier representation of the discretized laplacian , namely @xmath45 ( in line with the sign convention in eq .",
    "( [ operator ] ) ) , and raise it to the appropriate power , @xmath46 .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath43 , representing the fractional laplacian , are then obtained by inverting the fourier transform , as @xmath47^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}. \\label{integral}\\ ] ] this is the definition of a _ toeplitz _ symmetrical matrix @xmath48 $ ] associated to the generator ( the so - called _ symbol _ ) @xmath49^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ ] .",
    "the generic matrix elements depend only on @xmath50 and _ ad hoc _ algorithms exist for calculating the properties of this class of matrices , such as its smallest eigenvalue and the determinant @xcite . the integral in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) may be solved explicitly , to give @xmath51 in the special cases when @xmath52 is an integer , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are binomial coefficients .",
    "we remark that @xmath55 for @xmath56 , as the poles of @xmath57 are compensated by the zeros of the @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath59 are all positive when @xmath60 , but come in different signs when @xmath61 .",
    "thus , for @xmath62 the matrix @xmath43 can be normalized and interpreted as transition probabilities for a lvy flyer with stability index @xmath6 .    while superficially similar , our approach has notable advantages compared to riemann walks .",
    "the matrix @xmath43 does not suffer from any deterioration in convergence close to @xmath13 , and can in fact be extended beyond the range @xmath60 .",
    "the relatively simple structure of the matrix allows to incorporate bc in a straightforward manner .",
    "it is also suitable for some analytical treatments , as we will show in detail in the next sections .",
    "due to the non - locality of fractional laplacian , it is not possible to specify the value of the function @xmath32 only locally at the boundaries of a finite domain .",
    "doing so leads to erroneous analytical results , in contrast e.g. with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "this also implies that standard techniques such as the method of images are not applicable @xcite .",
    "subtle distinctions which do not appear in the case of regular random walks need to be introduced , such as between  first passage \" and  first arrival \" times , or between free and reflecting bc @xcite .",
    "therefore , a great amount of ingenuity has been employed to solve even apparently simple problems such as lvy flights constrained to live on the half - axis @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath43 introduced in the previous section is _ a priori _ infinite , thus representing the action of the fractional laplacian operator on an unbounded domain . within our approach",
    ", bc can be taken into account by modifying the matrix elements related to positions out of the considered domain in a suitable manner , as will be shown in the following .",
    "this modification leads in general to a matrix of finite size @xmath63 .",
    "we will study three different kinds of bc : absorbing on both sides , free on both sides , and mixed ( absorbing on the left and free on the right ) , with reference to two physical models .",
    "the first concerns hopping particles , the second elastic springs : both are well defined for @xmath7 and absorbing , free and mixed bc are easily implemented . in principle , the set of rules by which we will take into account bc can be extended to an arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "let us consider a particle jumping on a 1-dimensional discrete lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_hopping ] . when the lattice is infinite , at each time the particle jumps from position @xmath36 to position @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) with a probability @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath7 the probability is well defined if we set @xmath67 , as the elements @xmath68 all have the same sign .",
    "this model is naturally connected to lvy flights , since as shown before @xmath43 represents the discrete version of the generator of this stochastic process .",
    "let us now discuss how to take into account different bc on an interval @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "absorbing bc are imposed by removing the particle whenever a jump takes it to a site @xmath37 outside the interval . in the special case of brownian particles",
    ", bc may be assigned locally , since their jumps are of the kind @xmath70 and they must touch the sites @xmath71 in order to leave the interval @xcite . within our approach , absorbing bc are implemented by cutting the infinite matrix @xmath72 into a matrix of size @xmath73 , thus setting to @xmath74 all the other elements .",
    "free bc are implemented as in the metropolis monte carlo approach : if the sampled @xmath37 lies outside the allowed interval , then the particle is left at its original location @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the element @xmath75 is the probability to stay at @xmath36 . from normalization ,",
    "clearly we must have @xmath76 .",
    "these bc differ from standard reflecting bc as implemented e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , where particles abandoning the interval are sent to their mirror image with respect to the boundary .",
    "free and reflecting bc are identical for brownian particles , thanks to the locality of jumps .    in the case of mixed bc the particle",
    "is removed whenever @xmath77 , and remains at @xmath36 for @xmath78 .",
    "the diagonal element of the matrix thus becomes @xmath79 .",
    "now consider a network of springs connecting the sites of a 1-dimensional lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_spring ] . if the spring constant between sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 is @xmath80 , the associated elastic energy is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the displacement of site @xmath36 .",

    "absorbing bc are implemented in this case by setting @xmath85 outside the interval @xmath69 $ ] , thus cutting the infinite matrix @xmath43 into a matrix of size @xmath86 .",
    "the diagonal elements are now the same as those of the infinite matrix .",
    "physically , this corresponds to fluctuating interfaces pinned to a flat state outside a domain .",
    "free bc are implemented by removing all the springs connecting sites inside the interval to sites outside .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix are then @xmath87 . these conditions allow to describe fluctuating interfaces with no constraints at the ends : in the past , these bc have been implemented by using reflecting bc @xcite .",
    "we think that our procedure better represents the physical situation .",
    "for mixed bc we set @xmath85 for @xmath77 , and cut all the springs connecting @xmath36 with @xmath78 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix become @xmath88 .",
    "in this section we discuss our numerical results , as obtained by exploiting the above methods .",
    "we will mainly focus on the behavior of the first ( non - trivial ) eigenfunction of eq .",

    "in the following we will assume that @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "given the matrix @xmath43 , which now is modified as to incorporate the appropriate bc , standard numerical algorithms for symmetrical matrices are applied in order to extract the spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "then , to obtain the continuum limit , the eigenvalues of @xmath43 are multiplied by a scale factor @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the size of the interval .",
    "we remark that , since the first eigenvalue for free bc is rigorously zero , we focus on the first non - trivial eigenvalue . the eigenvectors of @xmath43 are naturally defined only up to a multiplicative factor , and the normalization will be specified later .",

    "the extrapolated value for @xmath13 is @xmath97 , extremely close to the expected value of @xmath98 .",
    "finite - size effects are very similar for mixed bc , while for free bc the power law convergence for the first non - trivial eigenvalue has an exponent of @xmath99 and the slope seems to be approximately constant , independently of @xmath6 .    to explore the structure of the eigenvalues of @xmath43 for large @xmath44 , i.e. in the continuum limit , let us define @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ figure_eigenvalues ] we plot the behavior of @xmath101 as a function of @xmath6 for absorbing , free , and mixed bc .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of the absorbing bc problem exhibit quite monotonic behavior and actually seem to lie on a straight line : we will come back to this point in section [ even ] .",
    "moreover , the eigenvalues of free bc seem to be tangent to those of absorbing bc close to the point @xmath13 .    in fig .",
