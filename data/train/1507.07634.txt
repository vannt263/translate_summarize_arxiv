    "seeking the most efficient way to recover the value of a parameter @xmath1 encoded in the state @xmath2 of a quantum system is the fundamental problem of a branch of quantum information technologies @xcite , which goes under the name of quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "it goes without mentioning that this topic has applications in a variety of different research areas , ranging e.g.  from the interferometric estimation of the phase shifts induced by gravitational waves @xcite , high - precision quantum magnetometry @xcite , to remote probing of targets .    in the standard approach one",
    "typically focuses on the case where several ( say @xmath0 ) identical copies of @xmath2 are available to experimentalists , who can hence rely on the statistical inference extracted from independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "measurement outcomes to estimate the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this scenario is particularly well formulated by those configurations where the unknown parameter @xmath1 is associated with some black - box transformation @xmath3 ( say a phase shift induced in one arm of an interferometric setup ) which acts on the input state @xmath4 of a probing system ( say the light beam injected into the interferometer ) yielding @xmath5 as the output density matrix to be measured , with such test repeated @xmath0 times to collect data @xmath6 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes](a ) . in this context ,",
    "the ultimate limits on the attainable precision in the estimation of @xmath1 , optimized with respect to the general detection strategy , can be computed , resulting in the so - called quantum cramr - rao bound , which exhibits the functional dependence upon @xmath2 via the quantum fisher information .",
    "see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]      the fisher informations @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) by the sequential scheme are plotted in the five panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcomp](a ) and are compared with the fisher information @xmath10 by the standard strategy with @xmath11 , for the case of projective measurements @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", the fisher information @xmath10 coincides with the quantum fisher information @xmath12 in the standard strategy .",
    "compare first @xmath10 and @xmath13 ( per measurement ) .",
    "we observe that the standard strategy provides better estimation than the sequential scheme .",
    "recall here that the input state @xmath11 for @xmath10 is the optimal for the standard strategy . on the other hand , in the sequential scheme",
    ", the state of the qubit is projected into @xmath14 or @xmath15 depending on the outcome of the projective measurement .",
    "if it is projected into @xmath14 by a measurement , it restarts to evolve from this non - optimal state for the next measurement .",
    "not all the steps in the sequential measurements are optimal for the estimation .",
    "that is why the sequential scheme can not beat the standard strategy , in the case of projective measurement .",
    "one can improve the performance of the sequential scheme , by incorporating @xmath16 for the estimation .",
    "indeed , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fcomp](a ) , the fisher information @xmath17 for the estimation through @xmath18 is greater than the fisher information @xmath19 solely through @xmath20 .",
    "note that no additional resources or experiments are required to incorporate @xmath16 : one simply needs to carry out additional data analysis to compute @xmath16 from the data used to evaluate @xmath20 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcomp](b ) , the gain in the fisher information by incorporating @xmath16 is shown for different temperatures .",
    "on the other hand , incorporating more correlation data , i.e. , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , does not help improve the estimation .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fcomp](a ) again .",
    "this is because every time one performs measurement the system is reset to a pure state by the projective measurement : there is no correlation between the measurement results separated over two steps .",
    "the system simply repeats the same dynamics , jumping between pure states @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the measurement after multiple steps gains no more information than that attainable by the measurement after a single step .",
    "let us next look at the cases with weak measurements @xmath23 . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fcomp](c ) , the sequential scheme can be better than the standard strategy . in particular , at low temperatures , the fisher informations @xmath24",
    "( @xmath25 ) by the sequential scheme exceed the fisher information @xmath10 by the standard strategy .",
    "the reason is the following . in the standard strategy ,",
    "the weak measurement is performed only once , and the system is reset to the specific initial state @xmath4 for the next measurement . the single weak measurement can acquire less information than a projective measurement , but if it is repeated many times , as in the sequential scheme , the information is accumulated , and better information is gained in our hands . at the same time , the system is gradually projected to one of the eigenstates of the measured observable by the repeated weak measurements @xcite . in other words , the repetition of the weak measurements mimics a stronger measurement ( closer to a projective measurement ) .",
    "that is why the sequential scheme can be better than the standard strategy , in the case of weak measurement .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fcomp](c ) that the precision of the estimation is improved by incorporating the correlation data @xmath21 .",
    "the gain in the fisher information @xmath26/\\mathcal{f}_0 $ ] by adding a correlation @xmath27 to @xmath28 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fcomp](d ) .",
    "the enhancement is reminiscent when the time interval between measurements @xmath29 is short , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the gain exhibits a peak at a smaller @xmath29 for a larger @xmath31 .",
    "this is because the two points of each two - point correlation @xmath21 , separated by @xmath32 steps , should be within the correlation time @xmath33 [ which is ruled by the second largest eigenvalues @xmath34 of the mixing channel ( [ eqn : spectrum_model ] ) ] , in order for the correlation @xmath21 to bear useful information .",
    "it appears that the sequential scheme can beat the standard strategy only at low temperatures ( small @xmath35 ) , but it should be noted that the standard strategy in fig .  [",
    "fig : fcomp ] assumes the optimal initial state @xmath11 , while in the sequential scheme the system is around the stationary state @xmath36 of the mixing channel @xmath37 , which is the thermal equilibrium state @xmath38 [ see ( [ eqn : fixedpointtheq ] ) ]",
    ". it would be more appropriate to compare the fisher informations @xmath24 by the sequential scheme with the fisher information @xmath10 by the standard strategy in the large @xmath29 limit ( which gives the fisher information with the initial thermal state @xmath39 ) .",
    "the estimation of a parameter encoded in a quantum probe , through a series of measurements performed sequentially on the probe , has been analyzed in a general non - i.i.d .  setting .",
    "on the basis of a diagrammatic approach we have discussed the conditions under which the central limit theorem holds as the number of measurements increases , reproducing the previous results @xcite and generalizing them to the case where the correlations among the measurement data are also taken into account in the estimation strategy .",
    "our analysis explicitly shows that the latter strategy can yield a significant advantage over the standard procedure where only the average of the acquired data is considered .    at present",
    "however it is not clear whether this is the best strategy one can do : it is indeed possible that different data processing ( including the evaluation of higher - order correlations commented at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : correlation ] ) can improve further the attainable accuracy . in the example",
    "studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : ex ] , the sequential scheme surpassed the standard i.i.d .",
    "procedure when we are able to perform only weak measurements , but could not beat the standard procedure when we are allowed to perform strong measurements .",
    "a better strategy for the sequential scheme could beat the ultimate precision achievable by the standard strategy .",
    "the optimal strategy would require different measurements step by step , or moreover would require quantum - correlated measurements over different measurement probings .",
    "the use of entanglement is also an interesting possibility @xcite .",
    "it is yet to be clarified what is the ultimate accuracy attainable in the sequential scheme for parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum metrology in the presence of noise is under intense study @xcite .",
    "the mixing property required for the sequential scheme is relevant to noisy channels , and connections with such issue would be interesting to be explored .",
