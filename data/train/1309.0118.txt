    "one of the central achievement of the theory of open quantum systems is the possibility of assigning to a given master equation an ensemble of stochastic realizations .",

    "when the measurement apparatus is sensible to ( detect ) transitions between the system s levels zoller , carmichael , dalibard , blatt , heger , the realizations consist in a sequence of disruptive instantaneous changes , associated to the measurement recording events , while in the intermediate time regime the ensemble dynamics is smooth , being defined by a non - unitary dynamics .",
    "these basic ingredients , which define the quantum jump approach  ( qja ) breuerbook , carmichaelbook , plenio , are well understood for markovian dynamics , that is , those where the evolution of the system density matrix is local in time .    in the last ten years",

    "much less progress was achieved in the formulation of stochastic processes that can be read as the result of a continuous measurement action performed over a system characterized by a non - local in time ( non - markovian ) evolution .",
    "in fact , while there exist different stochastic dynamics that in average recover a non - markovian density matrix evolution , its reading in terms of a continuous measurement process is problematic .",
    "remarkable examples are the non - markovian quantum state diffusion model @xcite and the unravelling of local in time master equations characterized by negative transition rates @xcite .",
    "the realizations associated to these approaches can only be read in the context of hidden - like variables models @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to formulate a consistent generalization of the qja such that in average the ensemble of measurement realizations recover a non - local non - markovian density matrix evolution .",
    "the basic idea of our analysis is to study the qja in a bipartite markovian arrange .",
