    "furthermore , it is unclear to what extent the solar wind detected in interplanetary space preserves sufficient information from the corona to help us learn how the plasma was heated initially .",
    "it has been known for several decades that elemental abundances and ionization fractions measured at 1  au must be `` frozen in '' at low heights in the solar atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "what are the processes that affect the thermodynamics of positive ions as they accelerate away from the solar corona ? because of infrequent coulomb collisions above the coronal base , particles that flow along magnetic field lines should want to conserve their magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that without any other source of heating , magnetic moment conservation would produce extremely cold and beamed ( in the parallel sense ; @xmath0 ) heliospheric protons , which is not seen ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in fact , at 1  au the majority of proton vdfs are close to isotropic , which seems to require some residual or anomalous coupling via collisions @xcite .",
    "heat conduction is an important carrier of thermal energy for electrons , but not so much for protons @xcite .",
    "the dominant sources of thermal energy for protons are believed to be the irreversible decays of plasma structures ; i.e. , dissipation of waves , shredding of turbulent eddies , and multiple types of energy conversion in current sheets associated with magnetic reconnection .    the goal of this paper is to determine the consequences of one specific proposed idea for proton heating in the solar wind : the dissipation of ion cyclotron resonant waves .",
    "although other sources of heat are likely to exist , we find it useful to explore how much can be explained by restricting ourselves to just a single main process .",
    "this mechanism has been studied extensively ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but often the microphysics of wave - particle interactions are decoupled from the macrophysics of vdf transport from the corona to 1  au .",

    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes with a discussion of some of the wider implications of this work and gives suggestions for future improvements .",
    "prior to delving into the primary physical process studied in this paper , it is useful to list the alternatives . ideally , each of the proposed heating mechanisms should be tested in a similar way as the ion cyclotron resonance idea is put through its paces in sections [ sec : disp][sec : radial ] below .",
    "here we are able to discuss only a fraction of the large number of papers that presented ideas for the kinetic energization of ions in the solar wind ; for other reviews , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "also , since our goal is to study collisionless processes that give rise to _ preferential ion heating and acceleration , _ we neglect the much broader literature of strictly magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) theories that do not focus on the kinetic consequences of coronal heating ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "particle and field instruments at heliocentric distances greater than 0.3  au have detected several marked departures from thermal equilibrium for protons and other ions @xcite . in the fast solar wind , ions tend to be heated more strongly than electrons , and protons often exhibit vdf anisotropies with temperatures measured in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field often exceeding temperatures parallel to the field ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite found that proton magnetic moments are not conserved between 0.3 and 1 au in the fast wind ; they increase steadily , implying a gradual input of perpendicular kinetic energy . also , most heavy ion species flow faster than the protons by about the local alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "these measurements were augmented by spectroscopic observations of similar extreme properties in low - density coronal holes @xcite .",
    "many of the models proposed to explain the proton and ion measurements involve the damping of mhd waves . however , there is little agreement about the most relevant wave types , the dominant wave generation mechanisms , or the precise means of dissipation .",
    "quite a few of the models also involve a broad array of multiple steps of energy conversion between waves , turbulent eddies , reconnection structures , and other nonlinear plasma features .",
    "nevertheless , it was noticed early on @xcite that one specific mechanism ",
    "cyclotron resonance between left - hand polarized alfvn waves and ion larmor orbits  appears to naturally produce many of the observed particle properties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "resonant ions `` surf '' along with a wave s oscillating electric and magnetic fields , and they experience secular gains or losses in energy depending on phase . for a random distribution of wave phases ,",
    "ions undergo a diffusive random walk in velocity space @xcite .",
    "one major problem with the ion cyclotron model is that the resonant wave frequencies @xmath2 in the corona are of order @xmath3 to @xmath4 hz .",
    "these frequencies are substantially higher than those inferred for observed alfvn waves ( e.g. , @xmath5 hz ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is difficult find a process that bridges that gap . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that the low solar atmosphere produces a continuous frequency spectrum of mhd waves that extends up to @xmath610@xmath7 hz . as the waves propagate up into the corona , the high - frequency end of the spectrum",
    "becomes eroded as the local larmor frequency decreases with increasing height .",
    "however , @xcite argued that heavy ions with low gyrofrequencies would likely be able to intercept nearly all of the available wave energy prior to it becoming resonant with protons and alpha particles .",
    "also , @xcite found that the radio scintillation signature of a basal spectrum of ion cyclotron waves would appear quite different from what is already observed in the corona .",
    "thus , the idea that ion cyclotron waves are copiously generated at the solar surface has fallen slightly out of favor , and other explanations have been pursued .",
    "a potentially more robust way to generate small - scale ( i.e. , high - frequency ) plasma oscillations is to invoke a nonlinear turbulent cascade .",
    "strong mhd turbulence is certainly present throughout the heliosphere ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many models invoke the idea that solar flux tubes are jostled by photospheric granular motions , and this propels alfvn waves into the corona that partially reflect back down to produce counterpropagating wave packets .",
    "collisions of these wave packets are believed to drive an efficient nonlinear cascade to small scales @xcite , but the ultimate dissipation mechanisms are usually not identified in these models ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "a distinguishing feature of mhd turbulence in the presence of a strong background magnetic field is an anisotropic cascade in wavenumber space .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the basic cascade process is _ not _ expected to produce fluctuations with high parallel wavenumbers @xmath8 , and thus it is not expected to directly excite much wave energy at the ion cyclotron resonance .",
    "spacecraft have detected anisotropic turbulent power spectra in interplanetary space that generally agree with these predictions @xcite , though there is also evidence that a fraction of the fluctuation energy can be in the form of high - frequency waves ( see below ) .    if one treats the small - scale fluctuations in an mhd cascade as linear waves , the dominant low - frequency modes at wavenumbers @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the proton thermal gyroradius , are the kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) and the magnetosonic whistler wave . in collisionless plasmas , these modes tend to dissipate via a combination of landau and transit - time damping . for conditions appropriate to the corona and heliosphere , the kaw mode seems to be most prevalent @xcite .",
    "although linear kaw damping may one way of producing the fast proton beams seen in interplanetary space @xcite , most of their energy goes into parallel electron heating @xcite and not the perpendicular ion heating that is observed .    for the last decade ,",
    "there has been much work devoted to finding the ways that low - frequency , high-@xmath11 turbulent fluctuations can heat protons and heavy ions . if kaw amplitudes become sufficiently high , the larmor orbits of protons and ions become stochastic . this in turn enables low - energy particles to undergo random - walk migration to higher energies , and this effectively produces perpendicular heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the latter have been suggested as possible sources of perpendicular scattering for protons and ions @xcite .",
    "still another idea is that turbulence may produce sufficiently strong plasma inhomogeneities  i.e .",
    ", velocity shears or cross - field density gradients  that the system may become unstable to the rapid growth of ion cyclotron waves ( see * ? ? ?",

    "it is possible that the smallest - scale fluctuations in mhd turbulence are not accurately describable by a superposition of linear waves .",
    "many simulations show that plasma turbulence eventually results in the presence of intermittent vortices separated by thin current sheets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both test - particle models @xcite and full vlasov kinetic simulations @xcite have shown that positive ions can interact resonantly with turbulent current sheets and become heated perpendicularly .",
    "a related idea is that when ions cross from the sub - alfvnic reconnection inflow to the super - alfvnic outflow region , they may undergo perpendicular acceleration via a rapid pickup - like process @xcite .",
    "there are also some ways that nonlinear alfvnic fluctuations may drive different modes of ion vdf diffusion than the ones predicted by classical linear or quasilinear wave theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are time periods in which the solar wind exhibits nearly monochromatic bursts of oscillation at or near the local larmor frequency @xcite .",
    "additional empirical correlations between variance anisotropies , the magnetic field geometry , and various helicity indices indicate that a non - negligible fraction of the fluctuation energy can be in the form of high - frequency alfvn waves @xcite . in the fast solar wind at @xmath60.3 au",
    ", non - maxwellian shapes of proton vdfs appear to be consistent with the velocity - space diffusion that occurs in ion cyclotron wave dissipation @xcite .",

    "other models propose that nonlinear couplings between alfvn and fast - mode waves produce a high-@xmath8 enhancement in the alfvnic spectrum because of the nearly isotropic cascade of the fast - mode waves @xcite .    in this paper we will study the kinetic and thermodynamic consequences of ion cyclotron resonant waves in the solar wind . @xcite and @xcite discussed several reasons why a population of these waves may be dominated by nearly parallel propagation ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) if they are present , and we restrict our analysis to this limiting wavenumber condition as well .",

    "we do _ not _ require ion cyclotron waves to be the dominant form of mhd fluctuation in the corona and solar wind , and in fact the results presented below agree with earlier studies @xcite that found only a small fraction of the total wave energy needs to be cyclotron resonant .",

    "this result is consistent with the results of @xcite , who found that one needs only @xmath281 of the total available wave power to be in the form of high-@xmath8 cyclotron waves in order to heat the protons adequately .    on the other hand ,",
    "the blue curve labeled `` damped / mode - coupled @xmath213 '' was computed using the full @xcite model for the alfvnic power spectrum in the corona and heliosphere .",
    "this model contained an anisotropic cascade , with only a small fraction of the total wave energy reaching the high-@xmath8 cyclotron resonance . in figure [ fig10 ] , we plot only the proton heating rate due to cyclotron wave damping , but the original model also contained proton heating due to landau and transit - time resonances . because the high-@xmath8 waves were strongly depleted in this model ( relative to an isotropic power spectrum ) , the heating rate @xmath276 is much smaller than is generally believed to be needed to heat solar wind protons .",
    "a complete understanding of proton energetics is likely to require more than one source of heat . in section [ sec : radial ]",
    "we assume that @xmath282 and @xmath283 are given by linear combinations of terms from cyclotron resonance and an unspecified second source that , for simplicity , we assume heats the protons isotropically .",
    "when multiple ion species are present in a plasma containing cyclotron resonant waves , it is possible for some ions to block others from receiving the full extent of the heating they would have received in isolation . this effect has been studied extensively for the case of alpha particles preventing the protons from being heated resonantly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "sometimes , however , the resonant damping may be so rapid that even an efficient cascade may not be able to supply wave power to the protons .",
    "the goal of this section is to estimate the degree to which proton heating rates ( @xmath282 , @xmath283 ) are suppressed by the presence of alpha particles .",

    ", we aim to take into account the high-@xmath8 damping due to both protons and alphas in a more self - consistent way .",
    "we follow @xcite and assume the `` replenishment '' of the alfvnic fluctuation spectrum comes from an isotropic cascade of fast - mode waves that are locally mode - converted into alfvn waves .",
    "this last step is assumed to be relatively instantaneous , which enables us to combine the effects of cascade and damping into a single transport equation for the alfvnic power spectrum .",
    "this transport equation is written in terms of the full 3d power spectrum @xmath286 to retain continuity with the equations of @xcite .    in the past ,",
    "turbulent cascades have been modeled as a combination of wavenumber _ advection _",
    "( i.e. , first - order transport that goes strictly from low to high @xmath176 ) and _ diffusion _",
    "( i.e. , second - order transport that spreads out the power in both directions , but ends up ultimately with a turbulent power law ) .",
    "many aspects of the transport do not depend on the relative strengths of the advection and diffusion terms , so for simplicity we assume pure advection ( see also appendix c.2 of @xcite ) .",

    "equation ( [ eq : edampsol ] ) exhibits an undamped inertial range at low wavenumbers , and it steepens to an infinitely sharp asymptote near the point at which the cascade timescale equals the inverse damping rate ( i.e. , @xmath299 ) .",
    "this transition from the inertial range to the dissipation range appears to model the expected behavior of the system reasonably well , despite the fact that the solution for @xmath173 at even larger wavenumbers is negative and unphysical . for convenience",

    "we experimented with using a smaller initial radius , but a proper model with @xmath415 would necessitate the use of departures from the power - law heating rates given in equation ( [ eq : qpower ] ) .",

    "@xcite and @xcite showed that if the system is driven to a point below the curve of marginal firehose stability , the net effect of the instability will be to heat up @xmath37 and leave @xmath36 relatively unchanged .",

    "equation ( [ eq : fire ] ) is consistent with the classical nonresonant firehose instability , but similar expressions taken from calculations of the resonant parallel or oblique firehose instability @xcite could also be used .    in order",
    "to illustrate how the solutions depend on the heating parameters @xmath358 , @xmath360 , and @xmath359 , we created several grids of models in which each of the parameters is varied independently of the others .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows a selection of these model results in the ( @xmath99,@xmath78 ) plane .",
    "it should be made clear that these curves do _ not _ show radial variations ( like in figure [ fig13 ] ) but instead give the conditions at 1  au that result from smoothly varying the heating parameters .",
    "different points along each curve correspond to models with different values of either @xmath358 or @xmath359 , and an increase in one of the heating rates tends to push the solutions from left to right in the diagram .",
    "we point out several properties of these models :    1 .",
    "the multicolor curves in figure [ fig14](a ) show the result of varying @xmath358 and fixing @xmath419 .",
    "in other words , they show that it is possible to populate nearly the entire observed region of the beta ",
    "anisotropy plane at 1  au by including _ only _ proton cyclotron resonant heating and a sufficiently broad range of @xmath358 and @xmath360 values .",
    "solar wind flux tubes with shallower radial power - law indices ( i.e. , smaller values of @xmath360 ) give rise to strong perpendicular anisotropies with @xmath132 , and flux tubes with steeper power - law indices produce @xmath420 at 1  au .",
    "2 .   the black dot - dashed curve in figure [ fig14](a )",
    "shows the result of varying @xmath359 and fixing @xmath421 .",
    "it shows that purely isotropic proton heating does not provide sufficient thermal energy to @xmath37 to populate most of the interior of the observed region of parameter space .",
    "in fact , for relatively low heating rates , the isotropic model produces roughly the same values of @xmath99 and @xmath78 at 1  au as does the cyclotron model with the steepest values of @xmath360 .",
    "the combination of these two cases appears to reproduce the lower - left edge of the populated parameter region quite well . a hypothetical model with substantially _ more _ parallel than perpendicular heating would extend even further to the lower - left .",
    "thus , the absence of such cases in the observations seems to tell us that the solar wind never exhibits @xmath422 .",
    "3 .   figure [ fig14](b ) shows the result of varying the dispersion relation , which affects the dependence of @xmath249 and @xmath250 on @xmath99 and @xmath78 .",
    "each of these models was computed with @xmath423 and @xmath419 , and the corresponding dispersion relations are referenced in the caption . at the largest values of @xmath358 , the models approach their respective marginal stability curves as also shown in figure [ fig09 ] . in the remainder of this paper , we choose to use the simple `` hot '' dispersion relation of equation ( [ eq : yhotx ] ) , whose marginal stability curve was highlighted in figure [ fig09](c ) with a thick solid black curve .",
    "although this model is more simplistic than most others discussed in section [ sec : disp ] , it appears to best reproduce the shape of the upper - right boundary of observed parameter space . as illustrated in figure [ fig04](a ) , this model may also be consistent with the perpendicularly `` stretched '' proton vdfs that result from fermi - like acceleration seen in the numerical diffusion models .",
    "data from the _ wind _ spacecraft were assembled over several years to define the occupied regions of ( @xmath99,@xmath78 ) parameter space outlined in figures [ fig02 ] , [ fig04 ] , [ fig09 ] , [ fig13 ] , and [ fig14 ] .",
    "the measured solar wind conditions included both fast and slow streams . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to simulate a realistic statistical ensemble of solar wind plasma states and predict its distribution of anisotropic proton thermal properties .",
    "the resulting monte carlo model involves randomly selecting three background plasma parameters ( @xmath348 , @xmath424 , and @xmath390 ) and three proton heating parameters ( @xmath358 , @xmath360 , and @xmath359 ) for each integration of the transport equations given above .",
    "the proton wind speed and radial field strength at 1  au were sampled independently from probability distributions constructed from 30 years ( 1980 to 2010 ) of daily averages from the omni in  situ dataset ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig15 ] shows these cumulative distributions .",
    "an individual sample is chosen by computing a pseudorandom number @xcite uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , treating it as the ordinate axis value in figure [ fig15 ] , and mapping down to the appropriate abscissa value . for @xmath348",

    "however , it does vary by about an order of magnitude between values of @xmath425 and @xmath426 @xmath398 yr@xmath101 .",
    "thus , we assumed a constant probability distribution in @xmath427 and sampled it with a pseudorandom number uniformly distributed between @xmath428 and @xmath429 . in combination with the randomly selected value of @xmath348 , equation ( [ eq : rho1au ] )",
    "provides a realistic distribution of densities at 1  au .",
    "initially , we experimented with randomly choosing the lower boundary conditions on @xmath36 and @xmath37 from a distribution of likely coronal temperatures , but the results were similar to what we found with the standard boundary condition described above ( @xmath379 ) .    it should be emphasized that our monte carlo procedure for selecting solar wind conditions is only a simplistic first attempt to `` canvass '' the full plasma parameter space .",
    "our cumulative probability distributions did not explicitly exclude omni data taken during periods when interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) were detected at 1  au .",
    "also , we did not consider the effects of stream  stream interactions in the ecliptic plane , which can produce plasma properties at 1  au distinct from those that would otherwise be found in completely isolated flux tubes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the firehose instability threshold of equation ( [ eq : fire ] ) was not used .",
    "figure [ fig16 ] shows the conditions at 1  au for @xmath4 random models with coulomb collisions , and @xmath4 models without collisions . the same green / blue color scheme from figure [ fig13 ]",
    "is used in figure [ fig16 ] . for both sets of models ,",
    "the random variations in density and magnetic field strength gave rise to a distribution of lower boundary conditions on @xmath99 .",
    "most of the @xmath99 values at @xmath378 fell between 0.004 and 0.23 , which were the 5% and 95% percentile values of the distribution , respectively .",
    "the heliospheric evolution from 2 @xmath382 to 1  au gave rise to ranges in @xmath99 that are reasonably close to what is observed , despite the fact that the distributions of @xmath78 values were clearly unrealistic .",
    "next , figure [ fig17](a ) shows the results of @xmath4 trials in which @xmath348 , @xmath424 , and @xmath390 were varied randomly and the heating parameters were fixed at values discussed above for the strongly heated fast wind : @xmath407 erg s@xmath101 @xmath408 , @xmath409 , and @xmath410 erg s@xmath101 @xmath408 .",
    "the symbol color is proportional to the resulting value of @xmath431 at 1  au , similar to figure 2 of @xcite . unlike the more idealized sets of points shown in figure [ fig14 ] , in this case the random variation of background wind conditions produces a significant `` filled - in '' region of the ( @xmath99,@xmath78 ) diagram at 1  au .",
    "however , only the right - hand side of the diagram is populated by the models ( i.e. , mainly @xmath432 ) , since the fast - wind values of @xmath358 and @xmath359 represent rather strong rates of heating .",
    "it appears that only weaker heating rates will allow the left - hand side of the diagram to become filled in .",
    "the occupied part of parameter space in figure [ fig17](a ) also resembles plots of measurements restricted to the fast wind , such as figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig17](b ) shows the result of a full monte carlo simulation that involved varying all six parameters of the model .",
    "in addition to randomly choosing @xmath348 , @xmath424 , and @xmath390 , the proton heating rates were sampled from random distributions as well .",
    "@xmath358 and @xmath359 were each sampled uniformly on a logarithmic scale between @xmath433 and @xmath434 erg s@xmath101 @xmath408 , and the value of @xmath368 at 1  au was sampled uniformly between @xmath435 and @xmath436 erg s@xmath101 @xmath408 .",
    "this produced a distribution in @xmath360 exponents that ranged between 2.57 and 5.14 , and had a mean value of 3.85 .",
    "vertical bars in figure [ fig10 ] illustrate the ranges of variation of the heating rates at @xmath378 and 1  au .",
    "even though the heating rates are varied over three orders of magnitude , these ranges never stray too far from existing expectations from other models and observations .",
    "the full monte carlo model was run for 95,000 random trials .",
    "however , we found that roughly a third of these trials ended up with somewhat unrealistic conditions at 1  au .",
    "thus , figure [ fig17](b ) shows only approximately 60,000 of them .",
    "unrealistic models were excluded based on two criteria :    1 .",
    "the largest collisional ages at 1  au were found to correspond to models with unusually weak heating .",
    "their heliospheric trajectories resembled the green dotted curves of figure [ fig13 ] .",
    "thus , we eliminated roughly 20,000 models that exhibited @xmath437 at 1  au .",
    "@xcite also made a similar collisional age cut to the _ wind _ data in order to better isolate cases of collisionless wave - particle interaction .",
    "for the eliminated models , the mean value of @xmath431 at 1  au was only 7,400 k , which is significantly smaller than the minimum proton temperature of @xmath612,000 k seen in the omni data .",
    "2 .   even though the heating rates were not assumed to scale with the radial magnetic field strength",
    ", we do expect the solar wind to exhibit some kind of magnetic correlation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it was not surprising to see that when the largest values of @xmath359 were paired with the smallest values of @xmath438 , the proton heating at 1  au was unusually strong .",
    "this effect can be parameterized by computing the rate ( i.e. , inverse timescale ) @xmath439 at 1  au , where @xmath440 is the magnetic energy density .",
    "let us also define a normalizing value of @xmath441 that corresponds to the strongly heated fast - wind model of section [ sec : radial : result1 ] ; this value is given by @xmath442 s@xmath101 .",
    "the full grid of 90,000 models contained cases with @xmath443 ranging over six orders of magnitude between @xmath444 and @xmath260 .",
    "we eliminated roughly 15,000 models that exhibited @xmath445 .",
    "for that subsample , the mean values of @xmath431 and @xmath99 at 1  au were 1.6 mk and 950 , which are well above the maximum values from omni of @xmath60.4 mk and @xmath630 , respectively .",
    "applying the above criteria gives rise to the @xmath660,000 models shown in figure [ fig17](b ) .",
    "the area of occupied space in the beta ",
    "anisotropy plane agrees well with observations at 1  au . also , the correlation between @xmath431 ( shown with symbol color ) and location in the diagram is similar to that in the _ wind _ data of @xcite .",
    "the _ left edges _ of the occupied region correspond to the lowest values of @xmath441 at 1  au . for those models ,",
    "there is not enough heating `` per unit field strength '' to drive the wind to high @xmath99 . whether a weakly heated model winds up on the upper or lower left edge depends on the extent to which the heating is mostly isotropic or mostly cyclotron . at the left edge ( i.e. , for @xmath446 )",
    ", we found that the anisotropy ratio @xmath447 is strongly correlated with the heating ratio @xmath448 at 1  au , and @xmath449 thus , if this model captures the real physics of the solar wind , it requires there to be a broad range of partition fractions between the two types of heating .",
    "this range must also extend up to @xmath450 in order to produce the upper - left edge of the diagram .",
    "figure [ fig18 ] illustrates how the monte carlo models behave in terms of their coulomb collisional coupling and relative alpha  proton drift . here , we applied only the second of the two above criteria ( i.e. , eliminating models with @xmath445 ) and we show the full range of collisional ages .",
    "the inverse temperature dependence in the collision rate is evident in that @xmath451 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that the models experiencing the most frequent collisions are driven toward the lowest values of @xmath269 at 1  au , and toward @xmath87 .",
    "however , the _ least _ collisional models ( i.e. , @xmath452 ) also seem to be driven toward isotropy .",
    "these models have large values of @xmath99 at 1  au and thus are constrained in @xmath78 because of the cyclotron and firehose instability boundaries .",
    "the goal of this paper was to begin exploring the detailed kinetic consequences of an assumed population of ion cyclotron resonant waves on the large - scale evolution of the solar wind .",
    "we found that the full range of kinetic properties of protons seen at 1  au is generally reproducible with a stochastic ensemble of both background wind parameters and cyclotron heating rates .",
    "other recent simulations @xcite have come to similar conclusions , but their random spreads of parameter choices were not so clearly connected to the actual `` histories '' of the modeled solar wind parcels .",
    "we also found that a broad range of _ relative contributions _ of ion cyclotron heating to the total heating rate ( i.e. , a broad range of @xmath448 ratios ) may be important to reproducing the low-@xmath99 part of observed parameter space .      1 .   in section [ sec : disp : bimax ] , a two - term asymptotic expansion of the plasma dispersion function was used to derive a new analytic `` warm plasma '' dispersion relation that simultaneously deals with both ion cyclotron resonance and the firehose - unstable regime .",
    "this dispersion relation ( see equation ( [ eq : wad ] ) and figure [ fig01](b ) ) also reproduces much of the @xmath99 and anisotropy dependence found in numerical alfvn - wave solutions of the full vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation .",
    "2 .   in section [ sec : disp : anshell ] , we found analytic expressions for a modified plasma dispersion function consistent with a simple form of a non - maxwellian `` resonant shell '' proton vdf .",
    "although the resulting dispersion relation was found to be equivalent to the two - term expansion discussed above , this derivation showed that some results coming from bi - maxwellian theory may still be applicable to other types of kinetic distributions .",
    "section [ sec : heat : diff ] described a generalization of quasilinear theory that replaces the dirac delta function associated with wave - particle resonance with a more realistic lorentzian function that depends on the damping rate @xmath54 .",
    "this expression leads to nonzero vdf diffusion coefficients in regions of velocity space that are classically nonresonant ( e.g. , @xmath200 for the resonance between protons and forward - propagating ion cyclotron waves ) .",
    "the numerical vdf diffusion models of @xcite were extended to protons in the presence of both forward- and backward - propagating alfvn waves .",
    "the early - time evolution of proton temperature moments was found to be nearly identical to equivalent bi - maxwellian calculations .",
    "also , it appeared that the late - time evolution into non - maxwellian shell - type vdfs exhibits cross - shell perpendicular diffusion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) even for purely forward - propagating waves .",
    "5 .   in section",
    "[ sec : heat : bimax ] , we solved for the locations of marginal stability curves ( defined by a vanishing time derivative of the proton anisotropy ratio ) in the beta  anisotropy plane for several different dispersion relations .",
    "figures [ fig04](b ) and [ fig09 ] displayed a surprising diversity of curve shapes .",
    "this indicates that any conclusions made about the ion cyclotron instability boundaries may be extremely sensitive to assumptions made about the wave dispersion and particle vdfs .",
    "section [ sec : alpha ] outlined a damped cascade model that describes how drifting alpha particles may intercept ion cyclotron waves prior to them becoming resonant with protons .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows how this model appears able to reproduce an empirical dividing line in ( @xmath99 , @xmath269 ) space seen in _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "despite the new insights gained from the exploratory modeling described above , it did not completely reproduce all observational constraints . at any rate",
    ", it points the way to improved methods of simulating the radial evolution of a realistic ensemble of solar wind states .",
    "other proposed explanations for preferential proton heating in the heliosphere  such as stochastic kaw heating @xcite  can be straightforwardly plugged into the same kind of transport model as the one described in section [ sec : radial ] .",
    "in addition to the need for testing other physical processes , it is also clear that the existing models of ion cyclotron resonance need to be improved in several important ways .",
    "this paper relied heavily on the bi - maxwellian assumption .",
    "one of our goals was in fact to explore in detail how bi - maxwellians can be useful tools for understanding the kinetic physics of the solar wind .",
    "however , it is well - known that measured vdfs often exhibit marked departures from this simple parameterization .",
    "other kinetic simulation approaches @xcite are helping to make clear how specific departures from the bi - maxwellian model affect the conclusions made about the large - scale energy balance of the heliosphere .",
    "the models described in this paper were also limited to purely parallel - propagating alfvn waves .",
    "however , the solar wind fluctuation spectrum is known to exhibit a broad range of propagation angles .",
    "there have been several studies of the radial evolution of this angular distribution @xcite .",
    "although there is still no agreement on the overall sense of the evolution  i.e .",
    ", is it becoming more parallel or more perpendicular with increasing distance ?",
    "it is evident that there must be wave power at all values of @xmath453 . obliquely propagating alfvn / ion - cyclotron waves",
    "have been studied extensively in a solar wind context ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some properties of the particle heating are different from the parallel - propagating case .    understanding the proton thermodynamics might also depend on including couplings between alfvn waves and other compressive mhd modes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one possibly important example , not studied in this paper , is the mirror - mode wave .",
    "it has been claimed that the upper - right boundary in the beta ",
    "anisotropy diagram is better described by the mirror instability than by the cyclotron instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mirror - mode waves have been detected sporadically in the solar wind @xcite , and it is possible that the well - known pressure - balanced structures ( pbss ) may be caused by them @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite modeled solar wind ion vdfs using a skewed non - maxwellian function meant to be consistent with a nonzero heat flux , and found that the mirror instability completely disappears , leaving only the ion cyclotron instability for @xmath132 .",
    "lastly , the properties of the alpha particles should be modeled simultaneously with the protons , and with a comparable degree of physical realism ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the very least , the sensitivity of the results in sections [ sec : alpha][sec : radial ] to our assumption that @xmath320 needs to be explored",
