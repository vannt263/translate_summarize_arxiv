    "( [ a1 ] ) become the sum of expressions of the same form in which , however , the domain @xmath133 corresponds to the presence of only full and type-2 lines .",
    "it is clear that by proving the statement for this @xmath133 : ( which is done below ) , we prove the original statement as well .",
    "let @xmath175 be a domain such that the surfaces on which are not tangent to the boundary @xmath175 .",
    "first , we prove that in the expression @xmath176 the integral over @xmath69 is absolutely convergent ( here the integral over @xmath70 is finite because @xmath177 , @xmath178 ) .",
    "this becomes obvious ( considering conditions ( [ 1.1 ] ) and the fact that , in type-2 lines , the momentum @xmath60 is separated from zero ) if the contours of the integration over @xmath70 can be deformed in such a way that the momenta @xmath60 of the full lines are separated from zero by a finite quantity ( within the domain @xmath179 ) . in this case , we can repeat the well - known weinberg reasoning @xcite .",
    "what can prevent deformation is either a `` clamping '' of the contour or the point @xmath180 falling on the integration boundary .",
    "let us investigate the first alternative .",
    "we divide the domain of integration over @xmath47 into sectors such that the momenta of all full lines @xmath87 have a constant sign within one sector .",
    "let us examine one sector .",
    "we take a set of full lines whose @xmath60 may simultaneously vanish . in the vicinity of the point",
    "where @xmath60 from this set vanish simultaneously , we bend the contours of the integration over @xmath70 such that these contours pass through the points @xmath181 and the momenta @xmath60 of the type-2 lines do not change .",
    "let @xmath182 be such that @xmath183 for the lines from the set ( for @xmath184 from the sector under consideration ) .",
    "it is easy to check that this bending is possible .",
    "( since the contours of integration over @xmath41 are bent and @xmath185 are expressed in terms of @xmath41 , one should only check that such @xmath186 exist , where the necessary @xmath182 are expressed in the same way , i.e. , that @xmath182 obey the conservation laws and flow only along the full lines ) . with this bending , rather small in relation to the deviation and the size of the deviation region , the contours do not pass through the poles because , for the denominator of each line from the set in question , we have @xmath187 and for the other denominators , the bending takes place in a region separated from the point where the corresponding momenta @xmath60 are equal to @xmath188 . repeating the reasoning for all sets , we can see that there is no contour `` clamping '' .",
    "the other alternative is excluded by the above condition for @xmath175 . to make this clear",
    ", one should introduce such coordinates @xmath189 in the @xmath38-space that the boundary of the domain @xmath190 is determined by the equation @xmath191 and then argue as above for the coordinates @xmath189 with @xmath192 .    after bending the contours , integral ( [ a2 ] )",
    "is absolutely convergent in @xmath47 , @xmath41 if tlie integration in @xmath47 is carried out within the sector under consideration . on pointing out that the result , of internal integration in ( [ a2 ] ) does not depend on the bending , we add the integrals over all sectors and conclude that ( [ a2 ] ) converges in @xmath69 absolutely .",
    "now let us prove that if @xmath193 is a quite small , finite vicinity of the point @xmath194 that lies outside the sphere @xmath39 , then expression ( [ a2 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "we consider the momentum @xmath60 of one line .",
    "flowing along the diagram , it can ramify or it can merge with other momenta . clearly , two situations are possible : either it flows away completely through external lines , or , probably , after long wandering , part of it , @xmath195 , makes a complete loop .",
    "the former situation is possible only if @xmath196 , where all external momenta leaving the diagram ( but not entering it ) are summed .",
    "obviously , @xmath173 can be chosen such that for @xmath70 from @xmath175 , a line exists whose momentum violates this condition .",
    "the latter situation results in the existence of a loop , where the inequality @xmath197 holds for all momenta of its lines and the positive direction of the momenta is along the loop .",
    "then the integral over @xmath47 of the loop in question can be interchanged with the integrals over @xmath70 ( because it is absolutely and uniformly convergent for all @xmath41 ) and the residue formula can be used to perform this integration . since , for the loop in question ,",
    "the momenta @xmath60 of the lines of this loop are separated from zero and are of the same sign , the result is zero .",
    "this has a simple physical meaning .",
    "if we pass to stationary noncovariant perturbation theory , we find that only quanta with positive @xmath9 can exist . in this case",
    ", external particles with positive @xmath198 are incoming and those with negative @xmath198 are outgoing .",
    "then , the momentum conservation law favors the occurrence of the first situation .",
    "the entire outside space for @xmath175 can be composed of the above domains @xmath39 ( everything converges well at infinity due to the factor @xmath199 ) .",
    "thus , on the left - hand side of ( [ a1 ] ) , one can substitute the integration domain @xmath200 for @xmath133 , set the limit in @xmath53 under the sign of integration over @xmath69 because of its absolute convergence , and also set the limit in @xmath54 under the integration sign because the domain of the integration over @xmath70 is bounded .",
    "thus , we obtain the right - hand side .",
    "the statement is proved .",
    "* statement 2 . *",
    "_ if @xmath133 corresponds to the presence of type-2 lines alone , then , under the same conditions as in statement  1 , the equality @xmath201 is valid . _",
    "the proof of this statement is analogous to the second part of the proof of statement  1 .",
    "* statement . * _ if conditions ( [ 1.1 ] ) are satisfied , the limits in @xmath53 and @xmath54 in ( [ 18 ] ) can be interchanged ( in turn ) with the sign of the integral over @xmath55 and then with @xmath202 . _    to prove this , we define the vectors , , and , where the vector @xmath203 is built only from external momenta and @xmath204 is an @xmath205 matrix of rank @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "next , we introduce the following notation : @xmath209 then it follows from ( [ 19 ] ) that @xmath210 the function @xmath78 is a polynomial and we consider each of its terms separately .",
    "up to a factor , each term has the form @xmath211 .",
    "these derivatives act on @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the action on @xmath212 results in the constant factor @xmath214 , the action on @xmath213 results in the factor @xmath215 or @xmath216 ( the latter is the result of the action of two derivatives ; @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 are constant vectors ) .",
    "it is necessary to prove the correctness of the following three procedures : ( i ) setting the limit in @xmath53 under the integral sign for fixed @xmath178 ; ( ii ) setting the limit in @xmath54 for @xmath220 ; ( iii ) setting the limits in @xmath53 and @xmath54 under the signs of differentiation with respect to @xmath221 . in cases ( i ) and",

    "the situation is similar for case ( ii ) .",
    "it is evident from ( [ b4 ] ) that the function @xmath229 can be singular only if the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath230 become zero . on finding the lower bound of these eigenvalues , one can prove through rather long reasoning that bounds ( [ b5 ] ) , ( [ b6 ] ) exist if condition ( [ 1.1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "after the limits in @xmath53 and @xmath54 are put under the integral sign , it is not difficult to interchange them with the differentiation with respect to @xmath221 .",

    "<S> introduction @xmath1    the hamiltonian approach to quantum field theory in light - front coordinates ( lf ) , , , is attractive as a possible method of solving strong interaction problems . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> the formal triviality of the physical vacuum allows one to seek bound states without prior investigation of the complex vacuum structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , as is already known , canonical quantization in lf , i.e. , on the @xmath2 hypersurface , can result in a theory not quite equivalent to the lorentz - invariant theory ( i.e. , to the standard feynman formalism ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due , first of all , to strong singularities at zero values of the `` light - like '' momentum variables . to restore the equivalence with a lorentz - covariant theory </S>",
    "<S> , one has to add unusual counter - terms to the formal canonical hamiltonian for the lf , @xmath3 ( the operator of a shift along the @xmath4-axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> these counter - terms can be found by comparing the perturbation theory based on the canonical lf formalism with lorentz - covariant perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is done in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> the light - front hamiltonian thus obtained can then be used in nonperturbative calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible , however , that perturbation theory does not provide all of the necessary additions to the canonical hamiltonian , as some of these additions can be nonperturbative . in spite of this </S>",
    "<S> , it seems necessary to examine this problem within the framework of perturbation theory first .    for practical purposes a stationary noncovariant light - front perturbation theory , which is similar to the one applied in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , is widely used . </S>",
    "<S> it was found @xcite that the `` light - front '' dyson formalism allows this theory to be transformed into an equivalent light - front feynman theory ( under an appropriate regularization ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , by re - summing the integrands of the feynman integrals , one can recast their form so that they become the same as in the lorentz - covariant theory . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is not the case for diagrams without external lines , which we do not consider here . ) then , the difference between the light - front and lorentz - covariant approaches that persists is only due to the different regularizations and different methods of calculating the feynman integrals ( which is important because of the possible absence of their absolute convergence in pseudo - euclidean space ) . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the analysis of this difference .    </S>",
    "<S> a light - front theory needs not only the standard uv regularization , but also a special regularization of the singularities @xmath5 . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> , this regularization eliminates the creation operators @xmath6 and annihilation operators @xmath7 with @xmath8 from the fourier expansion of the field operators in the field representation . as a result , the integration w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding momentum @xmath9 over the range @xmath10 is associated with each line before removing the @xmath11-functions . </S>",
    "<S> different propagators are regularized independently , which allows the described re - arrangement of the perturbation theory series . on the other hand , this regularization is convenient for further nonperturbative numerical calculations with the light - front hamiltonian , to which the necessary counter - terms are added ( the `` effective '' hamiltonian ) . </S>",
    "<S> we require that this hamiltonian generate a theory equivalent to the lorentz - covariant theory when the regularization is removed . </S>",
    "<S> note that lorentz - invariant methods of regularization ( e.g. , pauli - villars regularization ) are far less convenient for numerical calculations and we shall only briefly mention them .    </S>",
    "<S> the specific properties of the light - front feynman formalism manifest themselves only in the integration over the variables @xmath12 , while integration over the transverse momenta @xmath13 is the same in the light - front and the lorentz coordinates ( though it might be nontrivial because it requires regularization and renormalization ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we concentrate on a comparison of diagrams for fixed transverse momenta ( which is equivalent to a two - dimensional problem ) .    in the present paper , we propose a method that allows one to find the difference ( in the limit @xmath14 ) between any light - front feynman integral and the corresponding lorentz - covariant integral without having to calculate them completely . based on this method , a procedure is elaborated for constructing an effective hamiltonian in lf in any order of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure can be applied to all nongauge field theories , as well as to abelian and non - abelian gauge theories in the gauge @xmath15 with the vector meson propagator chosen according to the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question of whether the additional components of the hamiltonian that arise can be combined into a finite number of counter - terms must be dealt with separately in each particular case .    </S>",
    "<S> application of this formalism to the yukawa model makes it possible to obtain the effective light - front hamiltonian in a closed form . </S>",
    "<S> the result agrees with the conclusions of the work @xcite , where a comparison was made of the light - front and lorentz - covariant methods via calculating self - energy diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory and other diagrams in lowest orders . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for gauge theories ( both abelian and non - abelian ) , it was found that counter - terms of arbitrarily high order in field operators must be added to the effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this result may turn out to be wrong if the contributions to the counter - terms are mutually canceled . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for further investigation , but such possibility appears to be very unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> what we have said above does not depreciate the light - front formalism as applied to gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the only requirement concerning the light - front hamiltonian is that it correctly reproduces all gauge - invariant quantities rather than the off - mass - shell feynman integrals in a given gauge . </S>",
    "<S> however , renormalization of the light - front hamiltonian turns out to be a difficult problem and it requires new approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we do not examine the possibilities of changing the light - front hamiltonian by introducing new nonphysical fields by a method different from the pauli - villars regularization @xcite or the possibilities of using gauges more general than @xmath15 with the mandelstam - leibbrandt propagator . </S>",
