    "<S> inelastic light ( raman ) scattering is particularly suitable to address this issue given that , on the one hand , some of the raman active phonons are coupled to the electronic continuum and strongly renormalize across the superconducting transition and that , on the other hand , the structural transition is clearly reflected in the high pressure raman spectra of y124 with the appearance of several new modes  @xcite . furthermore , unlike many other techniques , the high pressure raman measurements can be performed using he as a pressure transmitting medium , ensuring the best possible hydrostatic conditions . </S>",

    "<S> the _ ab initio _ calculations , that accurately account for the structure and phonon spectra of both phases , indicate that the coupling of this mode to the electronic background is only weakly affected by the structural transition . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]-a to d , we take a closer look at the buckling phonon mode at ambient pressure , 5 , 8 and 10 gpa just above the superconducting transition , and at base temperature . at ambient pressure , the phonon softens by @xmath7 1 @xmath15 between @xmath10 and 8 k , in good agreement with previous reports  @xcite . upon pressure increase , </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity induced softening increases strongly to become as large as @xmath7 5 @xmath15 at 10 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]-e , where we have plotted the amplitude of the phonon softening as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath23 ( defining @xmath10 as the onset of the softening yields good agreement with published transport data , as seen in fig .  [ fig1]-a ) . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the evolution of the phonon renormalization in y124 under high pressure is reminiscent of the effect of hole doping in y123  @xcite , where the phonon renormalization is weak in the underdoped regime and becomes larger ( with amplitude comparable to the one of y124 at 10 gpa ) at optimal doping where @xmath10 is maximized . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency shift directly relates to the real part of the phonon self - energy by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the the electronic density of states at the fermi level , @xmath26 is the total electron - phonon coupling constant and re@xmath27 is the real part of the phonon self - energy .    in y123 , </S>",
    "<S> the doping increase of the renormalization is attributed to @xmath28 , that is , in the @xmath29wave case , maximized as the phonon frequency @xmath30 matches the amplitude of the superconducting gap 2@xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - induced hardening of the mode frequency ( as discussed in the data of reference @xcite for similar observations in underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath5o@xmath6 under pressure ) combined with pressure - induced changes of 2@xmath31  @xcite could therefore account for our observation . </S>",
    "<S> we can however not rule out a contribution of a pressure - induced increase of @xmath26 , supported by the increase of the normal state phonon lineshape asymmetry with pressure ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) . in any event , these data demonstrate that @xmath19 y124 remains superconducting up to 10 gpa .        above this pressure , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the buckling phonon at low temperatures becomes very different . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we show raman spectra at 14 and 16 gpa recorded at 125 k and 15 k in the frequency region where the buckling mode ( that has now the @xmath32 symmetry ) is seen in the high pressure phase . at room temperature , it appears as a single broad asymmetric peak  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cooling however reveals two lines around @xmath7 380 and @xmath7 390 @xmath15 that can unambiguously be resolved as they sharpen below 150 k ( for t@xmath33150 k , the low - energy mode frequency can not be accurately determined ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on our calculations , we assign the lower energy one to the buckling mode , and the higher energy one to in - plane vibrations of plane oxygen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> note that the two modes exhibit different slopes in their temperature dependence , ruling out the possibility that the presence of two peaks could be due to non - hydrostatic conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that , at variance with the behavior reported at lower pressure , both modes continuously harden down to the lowest measured temperature , as expected from an anharmonic decay model  @xcite ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> no softening is observed in the temperature region where the transport and magnetic susceptibility experiments have reported signatures of a superconducting transition  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> open symbols correspond to modes predicted by the theory that are not observed in the raman spectra . ]    in addition to the absence of renormalization effects in the two modes of figure  [ fig3 ] , no anomalies have been observed for any of the phonon modes of the new structural phase , unlike the many reported for those of the @xmath19 phase  @xcite . according to our previous discussion , the absence of phonon renormalizations in the high pressure phase could either be attributed to a suppression of @xmath26 or simply to the absence of superconductivity . to test the first hypothesis , following the crystal structure and lattice dynamical calculations presented above , we have calculated the electronic structure and the electron - phonon coupling constant for each zone center phonon in both phases .    the calculated fermi surface in the @xmath19 phase is shown in figure  [ fig4]-a and c and is in good agreement with previous reports  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of two hole like quasi-2d cylinders with mostly planar character centered on the brillouin zone corner _ </S>",

    "<S> though , the initial outer antibonding plane band is lifted and no longer crosses the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the inner and outer sheets of the fermi surface have now a chain character ( due to the collapse of the double cu - o chains structure , chain bands that were initially 1d become 2d in the new structure ) , while the middle sheet is formed by the bonding band of the cuo@xmath9 planes .    </S>",

    "<S> the calculated values for the electron - phonon coupling of the zone center ( @xmath51 = * 0 * ) , raman active phonons of y124 have been evaluated in the two phases , and the results are reported on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]-e . in the new phase </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the electron - phonon coupling constants of those of the @xmath32 modes that correspond to the @xmath22 modes of the @xmath19 phase do not vanish and remain comparable to the ones of the @xmath19 phase . in particular , the coupling constant of the buckling mode is reduced by about @xmath7 35% , which would lead to a sizeable superconductivity - induced renormalization if , as suggested by transport and magnetic susceptibility experiments  @xcite , @xmath10 ( and therefore 2@xmath31 ) were only marginally affected by the structural phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we do not observe systematic anomalies in the whole temperature range explored for any of the observed phonons . </S>",
    "<S> this is in particular the case also for the ba or the cu2 mode around 105 and 160 @xmath15 ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , possibly due to the drastic changes of the electronic structure induced by the double chain collapse reported above , under hydrostatic conditions , the high pressure phase of y124 is not superconducting . </S>",
    "<S> however , our raman data can not completely rule out the possibility of a superconducting ground state with a much lower @xmath52 ( and 2@xmath31 ) , bounded to about @xmath7 30 k.    in conclusion , we have mapped out the pressure and temperature phase diagram of the stoichiometric , underdoped , y124 high temperature superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of @xmath10 under hydrostatic pressure is accompanied by an enhancement of the superconductivity - induced renormalization of the buckling mode that persists up to @xmath7 10 gpa . above this pressure , </S>",
    "<S> a structural phase transition to a collapsed orthorhombic structure , well captured by first principle calculations , occurs and we do not observe any phonon anomalies at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> further exploration of this new metallic ( or weakly superconducting ) underdoped cuprate system may provide fresh insights into the electronic structure conducive to high - temperature superconductivity . </S>"
