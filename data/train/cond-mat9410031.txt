    "while much of the early work on the cuprates has focused on the copper oxide planes , recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite efforts are beginning to address the @xmath1-axis properties .",
    "in large part , this interest is motivated both by the availability of large , high - quality single crystals and by the realization that a full understanding of the superconductivity can not be reached until the role of the third direction is established .",
    "indeed , the third dimension is ssential for the high critical temperatures in some theories.@xcite    while a complete theoretical description of the @xmath1-axis properties of the cuprates is clearly desirable , a full understanding of these properties is hampered by their unusual experimental signatures . in the normal state , for example",
    ", the resistivity along the @xmath1-axis ( @xmath10 ) is quite generally metallic in the optimally doped materials and becomes semiconducting when the hole doping is reduced , while the in - plane resistivity ( @xmath11 ) always shows metallic behavior.@xcite at first sight , the metallic behavior of both @xmath11 and @xmath10 in the optimally doped compounds is understandable within the conventional bloch - boltzmann theory of transport ; however , the semiconducting temperature dependence of @xmath10 with metallic @xmath11 in the underdoped samples is difficult to reconcile with this picture . in the superconducting state , also , measurements of hysteretic current - voltage curves , fraunhofer - like @xmath1-axis critical currents as a function of in - plane magnetic field , and emission of microwave radiation at ac josephson effect frequencies strongly indicate that the cuprates can be viewed as a stack of sis josephson junctions along the @xmath1-axis.@xcite this situation is not at all consistent with the properties of conventional superconductors .",
    "one picture which may account for these anomalous properties is based on incoherent @xmath1-axis transport . in conventional metals ,",
    "the presence of the crystal lattice leads to the formation of three - dimensional bloch waves .",
    "the basic postulate of the incoherent approach is that bloch waves in the @xmath1-direction do not form due to the layered structure , intrinsic disorder , and/or strong electronic correlations in the cuprates .",
    "this situation is not equivalent to localization of the quasiparticles in the @xmath1-direction , though , because they may still hop _",
    "in_coherently between the cuo@xmath0 layers .",
    "working under this assumption , we will develop a theory which explains the unusual temperature - dependence of @xmath10 in the normal state and the intrinsic josephson effect in the superconducting state and which may also shed light on the question of the order parameter symmetry in these systems .",
    "the specific model we adopt was first articulated by rojo and levin@xcite and asserts that the cuo@xmath0 layers can be thought of as independent 2d fermi liquids weakly coupled along the @xmath1-axis by three processes : direct inter - layer quasiparticle hopping,@xcite hopping assisted through static disorder,@xcite and hopping assisted through dynamic , boson - mediated ( e.g. , phonon - mediated ) scattering.@xcite the semiconducting temperature dependence of @xmath10 is then associated with the reduction of the dynamic inter - planar scattering as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the @xmath1-axis conduction is therefore analogous to that of a very dirty , but nevertheless metallic , system.@xcite    we will show that all three of these processes give rise to josephson coupling , although their relative importance depends on the material and on the order parameter symmetry .",
    "it should be no surprise that all three mechanisms produce josephson coupling between the layers ; direct and impurity - assisted hopping processes formally resemble the tunneling processes considered in conventional sis junctions,@xcite and boson - assisted hopping has been known to contribute to tunneling in superconducting junctions in both the quasiparticle@xcite and josephson@xcite channels for some time . in the cuprates ,",
    "interest in these mechanisms has been piqued by the interpretation of experiments involving the @xmath1-axis transport@xcite and flux quantization in superconducting rings.@xcite this interest is reflected in a rapidly developing theoretical literature .",
    "in particular , we mention related results on intrinsic josephson coupling in the cuprates by graf _",
    "et al._,@xcite which came to our attention after completion of this work . as in this paper",
    ", these authors employ an incoherent hopping model to describe the inter - planar coupling in the cuprates .",
    "we differ in that graf _",
    "_ consider only impurity - assisted hopping while we also include direct and boson - assisted processes . as a result",
    ", we find a non - zero @xmath5-wave josephson critical current in fully oxygenated ybco without the need to introduce an anisotropic impurity scattering rate .",
    "in addition , because the present approach can describe the temperature dependence of the normal - state transport , we have been able to compute the full temperature dependence of the critical currents .",
    "we present our calculations as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model and the approximations used in our calculations . for later reference",
    ", we will also discuss the normal - state @xmath1-axis conductivity @xmath12 and derive expressions for the contributions to this conductivity by the three processes .",
    "we then move on to the superconducting state and derive the general forms of the josephson critical current @xmath13 which arise from each inter - layer hopping mechanism .",
    "the direct and impurity - assisted critical currents are found to have familiar forms , but the boson - assisted contribution gives rise to a novel expression .",
    "finally , we quantify our model by parameterizing experimental resistivity data in the @xmath7 ( ybco ) system and using the estimated parameters to predict @xmath14 for different oxygen stoichiometries and pairing symmetries . since @xmath13 can be measured directly@xcite or inferred from microwave penetration depth experiments,@xcite our predictions may be compared to experiment .",
    "based on these calculations , we conclude that low - temperature measurements of @xmath3 should be able to distinguish @xmath4- from @xmath5-wave pairing regardless of oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "moreover , we find that the @xmath1-axis penetration depth ratio should have either a 3d bcs character if the pairing is @xmath5-wave or a 3d bcs character which crosses over as a function of hole doping to a 2d ambegaokar - baratoff character if the pairing is @xmath4-wave . although experiments have not converged in the ybco system , we discuss the implications of our model for the pairing symmetry in the other cuprates in the last subsection . a preliminary report of these results has been published elsewhere.@xcite",
    "we begin by writing the hamiltonian for the electronic system in terms of the hamiltonians of the individual cuo@xmath0 layers @xmath15 and an inter - layer coupling hamiltonian @xmath16 : @xmath17 . here , the term `` layer '' denotes a composite object consisting of all the cuo@xmath0 planes within a single unit cell , so the transfer hamiltonian @xmath16 takes quasiparticles from one unit cell to another .",
    "motivated by ref .  , we take @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 a quasiparticle annihilation operator for site @xmath21 in layer @xmath22 and spin projection @xmath23 .",
    "the terms in @xmath24 represent a direct hopping arising from wave - function overlap ( @xmath25 ) , an impurity - assisted hopping due to static disorder of strength @xmath26 , and a boson - assisted hopping represented by the field @xmath27 with coupling strength @xmath28 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then the electronic hamiltonian added to the hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the @xmath29 field : @xmath30 .    in studying the properties of this model ,",
    "we make two assumptions ; the first relates to how we include incoherence in the model and the second to how we view the intra - layer dynamics .",
    "microscopically , incoherence may arise from strong intra - layer scattering,@xcite a non - fermi - liquid ground state within the layers,@xcite dynamic inter - layer scattering,@xcite or strong electromagnetic fluctuations.@xcite we do not attempt to construct a fully microscopic theory of this incoherence , but simulate it by taking @xmath24 to be a small perturbation on @xmath15 and calculating its effect within second order perturbation theory . this approach is similar in spirit to that of ioffe _",
    "et al._@xcite and should yield the correct features of a more complete theory . in order to perform quantitative calculations within this model",
    ", we also assume that the normal state of @xmath15 for each layer @xmath22 is a fermi liquid and that the superconducting state may be described within migdal - eliashberg theory.@xcite    from these two assumptions , the procedures outlined in the rest of this paper may be applied to any type of inter - layer disorder @xmath26 or inelastic scattering @xmath27 . for concreteness , however , we specify these parameters .",
    "first , we take the disorder to be delta - function correlated : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the overbar denotes the usual average over impurities.@xcite moreover , we take the electron - inter - layer - boson coupling to be structureless ( @xmath33 ) and the bosons themselves to be represented by an einstein spectrum of frequency @xmath34 .",
    "these choices do not affect the character of our results in @xmath4-wave superconductors , but they do affect the critical currents in @xmath5-wave superconductors in a way which will be discussed in section  iii .    when it is necessary to include intra - layer scattering processes in our calculations , we do so through a temperature - dependent scattering rate @xmath35 which is linear in @xmath2 at optimal doping , at least down to the critical temperature @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , all wave - vector integrals are performed by the usual technique of restricting the wave vectors to the fermi surface , taking the density of states to be constant , and then integrating over the remaining energy dependence .",
    "this approximation is appropriate if the fermi level is far from any structure in the density of states ( e.g. , van hove singularities ) and the other energy scales in the problem are much less than the band width .",
    "we assume these conditions hold here .",
    "to illustrate the application of our model and for future reference , we compute in this subsection the normal - state @xmath1-axis conductivity within the incoherent hopping model outlined above . by assumption , this calculation is to be carried out to second order in @xmath16 and thus becomes formally identical to computing the conductivity of an nin tunnel junction , with @xmath16 playing the role of the transfer hamiltonian.@xcite applying the standard theory of tunneling,@xcite we compute the correlation function @xmath37 \\right>$ ] with @xmath38 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) and with the @xmath39-dependence of @xmath38 determined by @xmath40 .",
    "the diagrams used in this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ; note that vertex corrections to @xmath41 are of higher order in the inter - layer hopping amplitudes and so are neglected . analytically continuing the fourier transform of @xmath41 to real frequencies",

    "( throughout this paper , @xmath45 ( @xmath1 ) denotes the intra- ( inter- ) layer unit cell dimension ) .",
    "the resulting conductivity is the sum of three terms , each corresponding to one of the inter - layer hopping processes : @xmath46 .",
    "the first term in @xmath12 results from the direct hopping characterized by @xmath25 and can be written @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density of states per unit cell per spin at the fermi surface and @xmath49 , up to factors of order unity , this conductivity reproduces the results of kumar and jayannavar@xcite and ioffe _",
    "et al._@xcite note that @xmath50 is proportional to the intra - layer lifetime @xmath51 , just as in the usual drude expression for the conductivity , despite the fact that the conductivity is viewed as a tunneling process . to understand this surprising result ,",
    "recall that the kubo formula for the conductivity in 3d metals leads to a particle - hole bubble with group velocity factors at the vertices , while these vertices become the tunneling matrix element @xmath52 for tunneling calculations .",
    "the kubo conductivity thus has a different form than the tunneling conductivity in 3d materials .",
    "for the 2d metals comprising the layers in our model , however , the tunneling matrix element for direct hopping is @xmath53 , and so vertices are diagonal in 2d wave vector .",
    "consequently , the kubo and tunneling formalisms give the same results.@xcite    the second and third terms in @xmath12 result from the assisted processes and are found to be @xmath54 for impurity - assisted hopping and @xmath55 for boson - assisted hopping .",
    "observe that the impurity - assisted hopping conductivity is the usual nin tunneling conductivity.@xcite also note that the procedure in ref .   of simulating the presence of boson - assisted hopping in @xmath12 by allowing the impurity - assisted hopping amplitude to become a function of temperature",
    "is microscopically justified by the more complete calculations which yield eqs .",
    "( [ eq : o_imp])-([eq : o_ba ] ) .",
    "the form of the conductivity given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : o_direct])-([eq : o_ba ] ) provides a simple explanation for the anomalous normal - state resistivity in the cuprates . at optimal stoichiometry",
    ", we expect the layers to be strongly coupled and nearly coherent , implying that the direct hopping should dominate @xmath12",
    ". consequently , @xmath56 as in conventional bloch - boltzmann transport.@xcite off optimal stoichiometry , the direct inter - layer coupling may weaken relative to the assisted processes , making the material increasingly incoherent . while this change would not strongly affect @xmath11 , @xmath10",
    "would now be dominated by the assisted hopping , the inelastic component of which would freeze out at low @xmath2 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : o_ba ] ) ] .",
    "thus , as @xmath2 decreases , the net inter - layer hopping amplitude would be reduced and @xmath10 would increase , as observed experimentally .",
    "these qualitative statements can be made quantitative through detailed fits of the normal - state resistivity to the rojo - levin model.@xcite",
    "the incoherent hopping model described above views the inter - layer transport as an nin tunneling process . in the superconducting state , this formulation of the transport immediately produces an intrinsic josephson effect between the layers . in this section ,",
    "we compute the temperature - dependent critical current associated with each inter - layer hopping process to determine the general features of the total @xmath3 . in the next section",
    ", we will apply these theoretical results to the cuprates and see what can be revealed about the order parameter symmetry and the relative importance of the inter - layer hopping mechanisms .",
    "the technique for calculating the josephson critical current in an sis junction is well known and is closely related to the corresponding nin calculation .",
    "one simply uses the same diagrams from the nin computation and replaces the normal green s functions with anomalous or gorkov green s functions.@xcite specifically , we define the correlation function @xmath57 \\right>$ ] and evaluate it using the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "the fourier transform of the resulting expression is then analytically continued to real frequencies to obtain the josephson current density produced by an applied voltage @xmath42 : @xmath58 $ ] . setting @xmath42 = 0 and adjusting the relative phase of the order parameters on different layers to maximize @xmath59",
    ", we obtain the josephson critical current as the sum of three components : @xmath60 in principle , these critical currents depend not only on the inter - layer hopping mechanism but also on the order parameter symmetry.@xcite    although the josephson critical current and the conductivity are computed from the same set of diagrams , there are significant differences .",
    "the most obvious is that the propagators used in computing the diagrams are different ; specifically , the phases of the order parameters enter into the josephson calculation in a fundamental way and affect how the imaginary part of the correlation function @xmath61 is taken .",
    "moreover , the conductivity is the derivative of the correlation function @xmath62 while the josephson current is the correlation function @xmath61 itself .",
    "we therefore can not expect similar behavior from these two quantities .",
    "in particular , we will see that the boson - assisted hopping does not contribute to the conductivity at low @xmath2 but _ does _ contribute to the josephson current .    in evaluating the correlation function @xmath61",
    ", we should ideally solve the full eliashberg equations@xcite for the layered system and use the results of that calculation to construct the anomalous propagators present in @xmath61 .",
    "this approach would naturally include all the effects of elastic and inelastic scattering which would naively have a large impact on the josephson coupling . as we will argue below ,",
    "however , this procedure is not necessary , since inter - layer scattering effects are of higher order in the inter - layer hopping amplitudes and the intra - layer scattering may be incorporated into a bcs - like gap function .",
    "as we shall see , this approach is a natural consequence of our model and is supported by the long history of experimental and theoretical work on the josephson effect in sis junctions.@xcite    in performing the reduction from the full eliashberg equations , we first note that all quantities in our model are by construction computed to second order in the inter - layer hopping amplitudes .",
    "this approximation is reasonable in the superconducting state as long as the hopping amplitudes are smaller than the maximum of the gap function , as we expect them to be .",
    "since the vertices in the diagrams for @xmath61 are each first order in the hopping amplitudes [ cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ] , the complete second - order calculation involves propagators for only single , isolated layers . in particular , there are no vertex corrections to @xmath61 and any loss of josephson coupling due to inelastic inter - layer hopping comes in at higher order in the inter - layer hopping amplitudes .    solving for the propagator is facilitated by observing that the critical current depends only on the weak - coupling propagator with the strong - coupling gap function @xmath63 (= @xmath64 in the nambu notation@xcite ) in the approximation where wave vectors are restricted to the fermi surface and the energy integrals are extended to infinity .",
    "hence , all intra - layer elastic and inelastic scattering can be incorporated into our model by computing their effect on the gap function . actually performing this computation for the cuprates",
    "is complicated by the presence of the unusual intra - layer inelastic scattering , which presumably gives rise to the linear - in-@xmath2 resistivity .",
    "since the origin of this scattering is presently controversial , we are forced to take a phenomenological approach at this point .",
    "empirically , the cuprates exhibit the generic features of bcs superconductors , although with quantitative differences in , for example , @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore adopt the conventional picture and compute @xmath13 using the bcs form for the gap function .",
    "theorem,@xcite in combination with the experimental fact that even very dirty tunnel junctions exhibit ambegaokar - baratoff behavior , suggests that this approach should be reasonable in the @xmath4-wave case . for @xmath5-wave superconductors ,",
    "the effect of disorder and scattering is more subtle,@xcite so our results should only be taken qualitatively .",
    "we conclude this subsection by recapitulating some of the assumptions which underlie the calculations which follow .",
    "first and foremost , we have simulated the effects of incoherent inter - layer transport through second - order perturbation theory .",
    "this treatment does not address the details of how the incoherence arises in the first place , so further work will be required in order to obtain a fully self - consistent description .",
    "we have also neglected the detailed structure of the cuprates within a unit cell ( multiple cuo@xmath0 planes , cuo chains , etc . ) and have treated the intra - layer scattering mechanisms approximately ; in particular , we have neglected the possibility of anisotropic scattering , which may be important in @xmath5-wave superconductors . additionally , we have not attempted a fully self - consistent description of the superconducting state , but have relied on bcs theory . as we have argued , these assumptions are well justified .",
    "we therefore expect that the results which follow will not be strongly modified in more sophisticated treatments .      from eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) , the total josephson critical current is the sum of three terms , each one corresponding to an inter - layer hopping process .",
    "following the preceding discussion , we calculate in this subsection the critical current from each inter - layer process using the diagrams in fig .",

    "by contrast , @xmath71 in the ambegaokar - baratoff formula.@xcite as a function of temperature , @xmath72 varies exactly as the in - plane bcs superfluid density , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dc-2dc ] for both @xmath4- and @xmath5-wave pairing . at first sight , it is surprising that an incoherent treatment of the direct interlayer hopping yields the same temperature dependence as the ( coherent ) in - plane transport .",
    "however , as in the normal state , the reason behind this behavior derives from the fact that the vertices in the tunneling diagram are diagonal in 2d wave vector and so give an effectively 3d result ( cf .",
    "the discussion after eq .",
    "( [ eq : o_direct ] ) ) .",
    "we also point out that @xmath73 depends strongly on the pairing symmetry at low @xmath2 , being nearly independent of @xmath2 for an isotropic @xmath4-wave gap but proportional to @xmath2 for a clean @xmath5-wave gap , as might be expected from the presence of nodes in @xmath74 .",
    "impurity - assisted inter - layer hopping gives rise to a contribution to the critical current which has the ambegaokar - baratoff form if the order parameter is @xmath4-wave,@xcite @xmath75 [ cf .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dc-2dc ] ] , and vanishes by symmetry if the order parameter is @xmath5-wave and the impurity scattering is isotropic .",
    "the assumption of isotropic scattering is crucial if @xmath76 is to vanish for @xmath5-wave superconductors ; if the scattering is anisotropic , then the critical current is in general finite.@xcite one generally expects impurity scattering to be mainly isotropic , so @xmath76 is probably small in @xmath5-wave superconductors , but detailed calculations of the scattering matrix element in these systems are required to make a quantitative estimate .",

    "finally , near @xmath36 , @xmath81 shows a linear dependence on @xmath84 .",
    "we may explain these features simply .",
    "first , the josephson current does not vanish at zero temperature because the zero - point energy of the bosons allows the creation of virtual bosons to mediate the inter - layer cooper pair tunneling . since the zero - point energy is proportional to @xmath34 ,",
    "the increase of @xmath85 with @xmath34 is expected .",
    "second , when @xmath82 , @xmath70 is the lowest energy scale and controls the integral , so @xmath81 is structureless . on the other hand , when @xmath83 , we see from eq .",

    "the decrease in @xmath87 compensates for this rise and eventually brings @xmath81 to zero at @xmath36 .",
    "third , the behavior near @xmath36 results from the fact that @xmath88 as @xmath89 goes to zero .",
    "the different forms for the critical currents discussed in this section give rise to the possibility that measurements of @xmath3 or the associated penetration depth may shed some light on the order parameter symmetry and the relative importance of the inter - layer hopping mechanisms in the cuprates .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effects of pairing symmetry in this simple model are quite strong at low temperatures : @xmath6 at low @xmath2 if the pairing is @xmath5-wave , and @xmath3 is exponentially close to @xmath90 if it is isotropic @xmath4-wave .",
    "this conclusion follows from the fact that @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath5-wave pairing , while all contributions are exponentially close to their @xmath93 values for isotropic @xmath4-wave pairing . even in a more sophisticated model that includes anisotropy in the impurity- and boson - assisted scattering processes ,",
    "the power - law dependence of @xmath3 at low @xmath2 for @xmath5-wave pairing should persist due to the presence of the nodes in the gap function .",
    "consequently , the low - temperature behavior of the @xmath1-axis critical current may be an important probe of the order parameter symmetry .",

    "this strong variation in @xmath132 with doping is consistent with an exponentially decreasing wave - function overlap induced by the increasing @xmath1-axis unit cell dimension@xcite and by disorder and vacancies in the chains .",
    "empirically , the @xmath1-axis resistivity increases by two orders of magnitude from optimally doped to de - oxygenated samples,@xcite which would also naively correspond to at least an order - of - magnitude decrease in @xmath132 .",
    "the data in table  [ tab : josephson ] also indicate that @xmath133 9:2.6:1 , indicating that the josephson current is dominated by the assisted processes in the de - oxygenated samples .",

    ", we note that @xmath135 in optimally doped compounds , indicating weak incoherence , but @xmath136 in the de - oxygenated compounds , which puts these compounds firmly in the incoherent regime .      using the parameters derived in the preceding two subsections in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j])-([eq : j_ba ] ) , we can compute the total @xmath3 in both optimally doped and de - oxygenated ybco for both @xmath4- and @xmath5-wave paring .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pred ] . for the optimally doped case [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pred](a ) ] , we see that the low - temperature @xmath3 for @xmath5-wave pairing can be clearly distinguished from @xmath3 for @xmath4-wave pairing , although @xmath137 is independent of the pairing symmetry . in addition , the critical currents for either pairing symmetry are distinct from the conventional ambegaokar - baratoff result , and this difference should be observable . specifically , the direct hopping dominates @xmath3 in the fully oxygenated case , so the observed critical current should have the same temperature dependence as the in - plane superfluid density .",
    "experimentally , this means that @xmath138 should equal @xmath139 in fully oxygenated ybco .    for the de - oxygenated case [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pred](b ) ] , we again find a clear difference between the critical currents for @xmath4- and @xmath5-wave pairing at low temperature ( although it is not obvious from the figure ) .",
    "however , @xmath90 now depends strongly on the pairing symmetry since the assisted processes are significant and contribute to the @xmath4-wave @xmath13 but not to the @xmath5-wave @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , while @xmath5-wave pairing yields a @xmath3 very different from the ambegaokar - baratoff result , the @xmath4-wave critical current deviates from this form only very slightly .",
    "thus , if the pairing is @xmath4-wave , it is unlikely that a measurement of @xmath3 will enable one to deduce the relative importance of the inter - layer hopping mechanisms .",
    "the analysis of these figures allows us to draw two general conclusions .",
    "first , the order parameter symmetry should be indicated by the low - temperature behavior of the measured critical current regardless of oxygen content , being a power - law for @xmath5-wave and exponentially close to a constant for isotropic @xmath4-wave .",
    "this result is robust and independent of the parameters estimated in the preceding two subsections . on the other hand ,",
    "the reduction in magnitude of the critical current from @xmath4- to @xmath5-wave pairing in de - oxygenated samples depends sensitively on the model parameters , so it is unlikely that the pairing symmetry will be indicated by an experimental measurement of @xmath90 , unless the observed magnitude is exceedingly small ( indicating @xmath5-wave pairing ) .",
    "second , the presence of incoherent hopping in @xmath140 should be revealed by the observation of either a 3d bcs character if the pairing is @xmath5-wave or a 3d bcs character that crosses over as a function of hole doping to a 2d ambegaokar - baratoff character if the pairing is @xmath4-wave .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that these measurements will in isolation allow one to disentangle the relative contributions of the different inter - layer hopping processes in the de - oxygenated samples .",
    "our model can be compared to direct experimental measurements of @xmath3 or to indirect measurements of this quantity through , for example , microwave penetration depth measurements . in the latter experiments ,",
    "the penetration depth @xmath140 is related to the critical current @xmath13 by the relation @xmath141.@xcite given the results of the preceding subsection , we should ideally compare our theoretical estimates to measurements of the critical current or penetration depth in ybco .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental situation is not yet resolved in this cuprate : some penetration depth measurements show an sns - like @xmath142 which is incompatible with our model,@xcite while others yield more conventional curves.@xcite however , we may still examine measurements on other cuprates and look for some of the generic features of our model .",
    "the most thoroughly studied cuprate with regard to intrinsic josephson junction effects is @xmath8 ( bscco).@xcite direct critical current measurements are available for this material that show ambegaokar - baratoff behavior in oxygen - annealed samples and a temperature - independent @xmath14 at low @xmath2 that falls rapidly to zero near @xmath36 in argon - annealed samples.@xcite within our model , the ambegaokar - baratoff - like @xmath3 in the oxygen - annealed samples suggests @xmath4-wave pairing and a significant contribution to @xmath13 from assisted hopping , which is analogous to de - oxygenated ybco [ cf . fig .  [",
    "fig : pred](b ) ] .",
    "the approximately constant @xmath14 in the argon - annealed samples is also indicative of @xmath4-wave pairing , but the rapid reduction of @xmath13 near @xmath36 is difficult to explain within our model .",
    "in addition to bscco , recent measurements of the @xmath1-axis penetration depth on @xmath9 ( lsco ) have been reported and interpreted within an intrinsic josephson effect picture.@xcite as with oxygen - annealed bscco , lsco shows an approximately ambegaokar - baratoff @xmath3 , which we interpret as evidence for significant assisted inter - layer hopping as well as @xmath4-wave pairing .",
    "however , the data do not extend to very low temperatures , so additional experimental measurements in this compound ( and in bscco ) would be illuminating .",
    "in this paper , we have considered an incoherent hopping model that reproduces the features of the @xmath1-axis resistivity in both optimally doped and underdoped cuprates .",
    "we have assumed that there are three processes which transport quasiparticles from one cuo@xmath0 layer to another : a direct hopping induced by wave - function overlap , an impurity - assisted hopping due to disorder , and a boson - assisted hopping induced by , for example , modulation of the inter - layer distance by phonons . by performing calculations to second order in the inter - layer hopping amplitudes , we have shown that this model yields an intrinsic josephson effect in the superconducting state , and we have analyzed the contributions to the josephson critical current arising from these three processes .",
    "we find a robust dependence of the low - temperature @xmath1-axis critical current on the order parameter symmetry which should be reflected in experimental measurements of @xmath3 or the @xmath1-axis microwave penetration depth ratio @xmath142 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the application of our model to ybco , where we have estimated the magnitude and temperature dependence of @xmath13 and find a clear - cut signature of the pairing symmetry in the low - temperature behavior of @xmath3 for both fully oxygenated and de - oxygenated compounds .",
    "additionally , our model predicts that the @xmath1-axis penetration depth ratio should have either a 3d bcs character if the pairing is @xmath5-wave or a 3d bcs character which crosses over as a function of hole doping to a 2d ambegaokar - baratoff character if the pairing is @xmath4-wave .",
    "measurements on bscco and lsco suggest that the pairing in these materials is @xmath4-wave and the inter - layer hopping has a significant assisted component , but direct comparison of our estimates with ybco is not possible because the data have not yet converged .",
    "further experimental work on both fully oxygenated and de - oxygenated ybco is clearly required and would provide a stringent test of our theory .",
