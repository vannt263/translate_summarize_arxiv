    "<S> we study fermions and hardcore bosons with long range dipolar interactions at fractional fillings in a topological checkerboard lattice with short - range hoppings up to next - next - nearest neighbors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case that the dipoles are aligned in the perpendicular direction by an external field without the complication of anisotropic interaction . using exact diagonalization , we find clear signatures of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states at filling factors 1/3 and 1/5 for fermions ( 1/2 and 1/4 for bosons ) in the lowest chern band with a robust spectrum gap at moderate dipolar interaction strength . the robustness of these fqh states against long - range interaction tail and band flatness is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> when the dipolar interaction decreases , the fermionic fqh states turn into normal states , and the bosonic 1/4-fqh state turns into a superfluid state . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic 1/2-fqh state survives even in the absence of the dipolar interaction , but vanishes when the hard core becomes a soft core with a critical onsite repulsion . in the thin torus limit </S>",
    "<S> , the static density structure factors indicates that the fqh state turns into a commensurate charge density wave ( cdw ) state . </S>"
