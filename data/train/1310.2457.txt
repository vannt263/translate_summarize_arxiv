    "in this paper we extend our previous results appearing in @xcite , where @xmath3-@xmath4 estimates for the solution of the electromagnetic helmholtz equation were proven , to the case of singular potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we want to preserve the behavior of the potentials at infinity , that is , consider potentials with short - range decay without assuming smallness . our goal will be to extend the well known @xmath8-@xmath9 estimates for the free helmholtz equation given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , to the case when we perturb the equation with an electromagnetic potential with singularities at the origin .",
    "more precisely , conditions on the electric and the magnetic part of the potential will be given in order to ensure that the estimates remain true .",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath4 estimates for the free helmholtz equation are the following @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a solution of @xmath12 the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath14 in have to verify some specific conditions that will be specified later on . here",
    "@xmath15 can depend on @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath17 and is independent of @xmath18 .    in the first part of the paper we will prove that the existing results for the free helmholtz equation can be extended to the perturbed equation by imposing conditions on the admissible singularity at the origin and decay at infinity for the potentials .",
    "this can be done without assuming smallness at infinity , neither for the electric part , nor for the magnetic part .",
    "it will be concluded that the range for @xmath13 and @xmath14 where estimates are true is not the same as the one for the free helmholtz equation .",
    "therefore this motivates the second part of the paper in which , by setting @xmath19 , we consider the helmholtz equation with electric potential and prove estimates in the same region of boundedness of the free equation .",
    "therefore , we consider the electromagnetic schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath5 of the form @xmath20 and the helmholtz equation in dimensions @xmath0 , namely , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the magnetic potential and @xmath23 is the electric potential . since now on , we denote by @xmath24 the magnetic potential @xmath6 is a mathematical construction which describes the interaction of particles with an external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath25 , which is the physically measurable quantity , is given by @xmath26 i.e. it is the anti - symmetric gradient of the vector field @xmath6 ( or , in geometrical terms , the differential @xmath27 of the 1-form which is standardly associated to @xmath6 ) . in dimension",
    "@xmath28 the action of @xmath25 on vectors is identified with the vector field @xmath29 , @xmath30 where the cross denotes the vectorial product in @xmath31 .",
    "we also define the trapping component of @xmath25 as @xmath32 and we say that @xmath25 is non trapping if @xmath33=0 .",
    "observe that in dimension @xmath28 it coincides with @xmath34 hence , @xmath35 is the projection of @xmath25 on the tangential space in @xmath36 to the sphere of radius @xmath37 , for @xmath28 . observe also that @xmath38 for any @xmath39 , therefore @xmath33 is a tangential vector field in any dimension and we call it the tangential component of the magnetic field @xmath25 .    in order to ensure the self - adjointness of @xmath5 we require some local integrability conditions on the potentials .",
    "we will assume @xmath40 from this assumptions it can be concluded ( see @xcite ) that @xmath5 is self - adjoint on @xmath41 with form domain @xmath42 note that by then @xmath43 is equivalent to the hilbert space @xmath44 since the spectrum of a self - adjoint operator is real , we conclude the existence of solution of @xmath45 for any @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for more details about the self - adjointness of the electromagnetic schrdinger operator @xmath5 .",
    "the main difficulty in order to obtain the estimates is that when the magnetic laplacian is expanded we have to deal with a first order term , namely @xmath48 , and it is well known that there are no @xmath8-@xmath9 estimates for the gradient of the solution of the free helmholtz equation , @xmath49 the main result of the paper appears in section [ sec : magnetic ] , concretely theorem [ thm : elecmag ] .",
    "we will proceed in the following way .",
    "let us consider the modified helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential and fixed frequency @xmath50 .",
    "it is given by @xmath51    for convenience we will deal only with the case @xmath50 , in contrast with the case of general @xmath52 .    in order to derive the estimates for the solution of , @xmath8-@xmath9 estimates , independent of @xmath18 ,",
    "will be obtained for the solution of the modified helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential .",
    "the independence of @xmath18 for the estimates will imply that these will remain true for the solution of .",
    "this is true due some results in @xcite .",
    "our method is a mixture of a priori estimates and perturbative arguments .",
    "this is what allows us to avoid smallness conditions in the potentials .",
    "similar arguments have been used in the setting of the free schrdinger equation , as can be seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "along the proof our basic tools will be the corresponding @xmath8-@xmath9 estimates and a @xmath53-local estimate for the solution of the free helmholtz equation , together with an a priori estimate for the solution of the modified helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential .",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "for @xmath54 we define the morrey - campanato norm as @xmath55 moreover , we denote , for @xmath56 , the annulus c(j ) by @xmath57 @xmath58 and we easily see the duality relation @xmath59 these norms were introduced by kenig , ponce and vega in @xcite .    concerning the perturbative part of our argument , it is necessary to remind the results that are true for the free helmholtz equation .",
    "firstly , we are going to state the result concerning the @xmath8-@xmath9 estimates which appears in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we have that , given precise conditions on the admissible singularity at the origin for the electromagnetic potential , and the decay at infinity as well , a morrey - campanato type estimate for the solution of the perturbed helmholtz equation holds for @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen in @xcite .",
    "we give now the main assumptions that must verify the potentials @xmath79 and @xmath80 in @xcite .",

    "then , from theorem [ thm : helmfree ] and observing that , since the dual estimate of in theorem [ thm : triple ] can not be applied for the perturbative term @xmath200 because we are outside the allowed range for @xmath14 , we conclude that the @xmath4 norm of the solution of the equation can be bounded as follows @xmath315 where @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath18 .      in order to give the necessary conditions that must satisfy the electric potential , namely , the admissible singularity at the origin and the decay at infinity , we analyze separately the @xmath319 norm of @xmath200 .",
    "we have that @xmath320 where , @xmath321 was the annulus given by @xmath57 therefore , if @xmath177 , @xmath155 , we get @xmath322 now , we apply hlder inequality for @xmath323 and we obtain the following .",
