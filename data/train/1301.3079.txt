    "one of the fundamental postulates of general relativity ( gr ) is the equivalence principle .",
    "this postulate states that , due to the universality of the gravitational field , it can be set to zero locally ( at most along a geodesic ) by a change of coordinates .",
    "in other words , the gravitational effects upon a fluid containing up to first derivatives of the newtonian potential , which corresponds to first derivatives of the metric tensor , can be eliminated by a change of reference frame .",
    "the equivalence principle plus the principle of general covariance provide the conservation law of the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid with respect to the spacetime metric .",
    "the question we address in this paper , by providing a concrete example in the cosmological scenario , is that gravitational effects which manifest themselves only from second derivatives of the metric and , therefore , can not be cancelled through the equivalence principle , can be associated to viscous process in fluid mechanics .",
    "such effect can be understood as being consequence of the non - negligible gravitational interaction at the microscopic level between the constituting particles of the fluid resulting in dissipative terms and producing non - local effects of purely gravitational origin that are not geometrized in gr .    to clarify our exposition , we present our proposal from the point of view of two distinct approaches of gr :",
    "one is given by the einstein formulation @xcite and the other one is given by the quasi - maxwellian ( qm ) equations @xcite .",
    "once the qm equations involve a higher order of differentiability than gr , according to lichnerowicz s theorem @xcite , these formulations are equivalent only if appropriate initial conditions are used .",
    "it is clear that the theorem constrains the solutions of the qm equations in order that both formulations surely give the same results .",
    "the critical point of this restriction appears when we want to determine the initial data in terms of observable quantities aiming to guarantee that the solution we shall obtain has something to do with the empirical ingredients we started with .",
    "it is well known that the observables in gr can only be determined through geodesic deviation and that they affect the curvature tensor .",
    "this tensor has 20 independent components that can be expressed in terms of the ricci tensor , the scalar curvature and the weyl tensor . in the usual formulation of the einstein equations",
    "only the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature are present .",
    "they are written in terms of derivatives of @xmath1 and nothing can be inferred about the weyl tensor before obtaining the solution of the metric .",
    "the main issue is that many empirical data are directly represented by the weyl tensor , for example , the tidal forces or non - vanishing gravitational fields in the absence of matter . in other words , in einstein s formulation , it is not possible to look for a complete solution of gr corresponding to a determined weyl tensor specified by a given set of empirical data .",
    "such information can not be expressed in terms of the initial values of the variables of the einstein equations .",
    "all these difficulties do not appear in the qm formulation of gravity . in this approach ,",
    "the variables of the theory represent directly the empirical data and the einstein equations are used ( as a first integral ) to relate the weyl tensor to the energy - momentum tensor through differential equations involving both . in particular , in this paper , we present how this relation takes place when we analyze the standard cosmological model ( scm ) .",
    "the scm described by flrw metrics ( friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ) experiences difficulties in which exotic components of matter and energy are introduced in an attempt to explain , for instance , the apparent accelerated expansion of the universe ( dark energy ) , the galaxy rotation curves ( dark matter ) or the initial singularity in the far past of its history .",
    "some authors claim that the main problem lies on the huge simplification of the geometry adopted and hence they suggest modifications of spacetime symmetries as in the case of inhomogeneous models @xcite , in particular indicating the differences between average processes @xcite , or modifications in the coupling between matter and geometry as displayed by some bouncing cosmologies @xcite , or even non - conventional proposals as @xcite , which change completely our understanding upon the spacetime itself .",
    "notwithstanding , our proposal is simpler .",
    "we have shown that even metrics very similar to the friedmann one ( which we shall specify afterwards ) admit a more general solution when we introduce an anisotropic pressure term @xmath2 in the einstein equations .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , such term has been considered in the establishment of some cosmological models , but two simple reasonings make it an undesirable term in cosmology : first , it violates all the symmetries of the flrw metrics ; second , in the case of shear - free geometries ( e.g. the friedmann metric ) there is no other traceless symmetric tensor phenomenologically linked to @xmath2 .",
    "both arguments are not completely true and we shall see that this term can be very important in the transition from an inhomogeneous model to the flrw models , because the dynamics of the solution is given by friedmann equations not only in asymptotic regimes @xcite",
    ".    summarizing , in the present paper we show that if one considers a larger class of geometries than the flrw ones , restricted by the imposition @xmath3 , where @xmath4 possesses constant scalar curvature , and an energy - momentum tensor representing a simple fluid with an anisotropic pressure , the einstein equations allow a more general solution which has the usual time evolution given by the friedmann equations and a 3-space given by the schwarzschild lattice , for vanishing spatial curvature .",
    "however , some geometrical properties remain obscure in the einstein formalism . on the other hand , using the qm equations we immediately obtain a non - zero weyl tensor given in terms of the anisotropic pressure . therefore , assuming the lichnerowicz theorem , we are led to affirm that both formulations should be considered as complementary from the point of view of the determination of initial conditions in gr . in the next section we revisit the friedmann solution in order to do a self - consistent exhibition of our results .",
    "the observational data indicates that the friedmann geometry is more convenient to describe our universe , mainly because of its homogeneity and isotropy at large scales .",
    "these symmetries suggest that the only possible fluid satisfying these properties is a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath5 and isotropic pressure @xmath6 . however , as we mentioned before , this is not a paradigm . in this paper",
    ", we consider an imperfect fluid as source for the gravitational field and some special symmetries of spacetime are still preserved .    to make a self - consistent exposition of our results , we present here a brief derivation of the friedmann model .",

    "we have seen that the einstein equations do not contain in its dynamics all the information necessary to determine the curvature tensor from empirical data . from this point of view , it means that the initial condition problem in gr ( or the cauchy problem ) should be revisited in order to get a more realistic description of the universe . in other words ,",
    "the einstein equations correspond to an open system rather than a closed totality representing the universe , because at any time new elements , for instance the weyl tensor , can play a role and modify some features of the spacetime , as we have presented in this paper .",
    "in particular , we have shown how the standard cosmological model sets the weyl tensor equal to zero _ ab initio _ and that this is not a consequence of the friedmann equations .",
    "therefore , we have developed a cosmological model with constant spatial curvature and non - zero weyl tensor without spoiling the conventional time evolution of the universe .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "m. novello for many clarifying developments on qm equations",
    ". the authors also acknowledge cnpq for the financial support .",
    "we know that a riemannian geometry satisfies the bianchi identities . in particular , in the case of general relativity , the bianchi identities together with the einstein equations yield the quasi - maxwellian equations of gravity .",
    "these equations are easily obtained if we rewrite the riemann tensor in terms of its traces and the weyl tensor :                the reason of this nomenclature is due to several analogies between the quasi - maxwellian and the maxwell equations . however",
    ", this similarity can not be applied to the dynamical equations because the qm equations are in fact highly non - linear and of higher order of differentiability in comparison to maxwell s theory , leading to situations that never happen in the last case .",
    "indeed , the similitude appears when we make the projection of the qm equations with respect to the vector field @xmath124 and its orthogonal hypersurface . at this point",
    ", it is very useful to replace the weyl tensor by its electric @xmath125 and magnetic @xmath126 parts :      where @xmath128 is the dual of weyl tensor constructed with the skew - symmetric levi - civita tensor . in the same way as the faraday tensor @xmath129 , we can rewrite the weyl tensor in terms of the quantities defined above    @xmath130}{}^{[\\mu}v^{\\nu ] } + \\delta_{[\\alpha}^{[\\mu}e_{\\beta]}^{\\nu ] } - \\eta_{\\alpha\\beta\\lambda\\sigma}v^{\\lambda}h^{\\sigma[\\mu}v^{\\nu]}-\\eta^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\sigma}v_{\\lambda}h_{\\sigma[\\alpha}v_{\\beta]}.\\ ] ]            @xmath136 w^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}{}_{;\\nu}\\eta^{\\sigma\\lambda}{}_{\\alpha\\beta}v_{\\mu}v_{\\lambda},\\\\[1ex ] w^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}{}_{;\\nu}h_{\\mu}{}^{(\\sigma}\\eta^{\\tau)\\lambda}{}_{\\alpha\\beta}v_{\\lambda},\\\\[1ex ] w^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}{}_{;\\nu}v_{\\beta}h_{\\mu(\\tau}h_{\\sigma)\\alpha } , \\end{array}\\ ] ]          @xmath139 - { \\frac{\\textstyle{3}}{\\textstyle{4}}}q^{(\\epsilon}\\omega^{\\lambda ) } + { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{2}}}h^{\\epsilon\\lambda}q^{\\mu}\\omega_{\\mu } + { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{4}}}\\sigma_{\\beta}{}^{(\\epsilon}\\eta^{\\lambda)\\alpha\\beta\\mu}v_{\\mu}q_{\\alpha } + { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{4}}}h^{\\nu(\\epsilon}\\eta^{\\lambda)\\alpha\\beta\\mu}v_{\\mu}\\pi_{\\nu\\alpha;\\beta } ; \\end{array}\\ ] ]    @xmath140 { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{6}}}h^{\\epsilon\\lambda}(q^{\\mu}{}_{;\\mu } -q^{\\mu}a_{\\mu } -\\pi^{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } ) -{\\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{2}}}(\\rho+p)\\sigma^{\\epsilon\\lambda}+{\\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{2}}}q^{(\\epsilon}a^{\\lambda)}-{\\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{4}}}h^{\\mu(\\epsilon}h^{\\lambda)\\alpha}q_{\\mu;\\alpha } + { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{2}}}h_{\\alpha}{}^{\\epsilon}h_{\\mu}{}^{\\lambda}\\dot\\pi^{\\alpha\\mu } + { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{4}}}\\pi_{\\beta}{}^{(\\epsilon}\\sigma^{\\lambda)\\beta}+\\\\[2ex ] - { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{4}}}\\pi_{\\beta}{}^{(\\epsilon}\\omega^{\\lambda)\\beta } + { \\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{6}}}\\theta\\pi^{\\epsilon\\lambda}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    these are the quasi - maxwellian equations and it is clear the similitude to the maxwell equations : the first pair corresponds to @xmath141 and @xmath142 , while the last pair gives the time evolution of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively . to obtain a self - consistent system of equations we need to add the energy - momentum tensor conservation law @xmath145 , which gives        the integrability condition @xmath148 applied to the observer field we have chosen ,",
    "can be translated into evolution equations plus constraints for the kinematical quantities .",
    "thereby , the evolution equations are                  for the sake of comparison , this set of equations is exactly the same one presented in hawking s pioneer work @xcite and by ellis in @xcite ( except for conventions adopted ) .",
    "these equations have been extensively used to perform covariant and gauge - invariant perturbation theory in cosmology and , as we said before , they propagate the solutions of the einstein equations defined only on a given cauchy surface to the whole spacetime",
