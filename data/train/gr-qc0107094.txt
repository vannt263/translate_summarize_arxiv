    "the cauchy problem for the massive dirac equation in the non - extreme kerr - newman black hole geometry outside the event horizon was recently studied  @xcite , and it was proved that for initial data in @xmath0 with @xmath5 decay at infinity , the probability for the dirac particle to be located in any compact region of space tends to zero as @xmath6 .",
    "this result shows that the dirac particle must eventually either disappear into the event horizon or escape to infinity .",
    "the questions of the likelihood of each of these possibilities and the rates of decay of the dirac wave function in a compact region of space were left open . in the present paper , we shall study these questions by means of a detailed analysis of the integral representation of the dirac propagator constructed in  @xcite",
    ". this analysis will also give us some insight into the physical mechanism which leads to the decay .",
    "recall that in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the kerr - newman metric is given by @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 and the electromagnetic potential is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the mass , the angular momentum and the charge of the black hole , respectively . here",
    "@xmath17 and/or @xmath16 are allowed to be zero , so that our results apply also to the kerr , reissner - nordstrm , and schwarzschild solutions .",
    "we shall restrict attention to the _ non - extreme case _",
    "@xmath18 , in which case the function @xmath19 has two distinct zeros , @xmath20 corresponding to the cauchy horizon and the event horizon , respectively .",
    "we will here consider only the region @xmath21 outside of the event horizon , and thus @xmath22 .",
    "our starting point is the representation of the dirac propagator for a dirac particle of mass @xmath23 and charge @xmath24 established in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.6 ) @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the initial data , @xmath27 is the energy , and @xmath28 is a positive scalar product ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the quantum number @xmath29 arises from the usual separation @xmath30 of the angular dependence around the axis of symmetry , whereas @xmath31 labels the eigenvalues of generalized total angular momentum in chandrasekhar s separation of the dirac equation into odes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 are solutions of the dirac equation and @xmath33 are complex coefficients ; they can all be expressed in terms of the fundamental solutions to these odes .",
    "we postpone the detailed formulas for @xmath32 and @xmath34 to later sections , and here merely describe those qualitative properties of the wave functions @xmath32 which are needed for understanding our results .",
    "near the event horizon , the @xmath32 go over asymptotically to spherical waves . in the region @xmath35 ,",
    "the solutions for @xmath36 are the _ incoming waves _ , i.e.  asymptotically near the event horizon they are waves moving towards the black hole .",
    "conversely , the solutions for @xmath37 are the _ outgoing waves _ , which near the event horizon move outwards , away from the black hole",
    ". asymptotically near infinity , the @xmath32 , @xmath35 , go over to spherical waves . in the region @xmath38 , however , the fundamental solutions for @xmath39 near the event horizon are both linear combinations of incoming and outgoing waves , taken in such a way that @xmath40 and @xmath41 at infinity have exponential decay and growth , respectively .    for technical simplicity",
    ", we make the assumption that @xmath26 is _ smooth _ and _ compactly supported _ outside the event horizon .",
    "we point out that , while the assumption of compact support is physically reasonable at infinity , it is indeed restrictive with respect to the behavior near the event horizon .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that the _ angular momentum is bounded _ in the strict sense that there exist constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 \\;.     \\label{eq:1b}\\ ] ] we expect that the rate of decay is the same if an infinite number of angular modes are present .",
    "namely , away from the event horizon , modes with large angular momentum feel strong centrifugal forces and should therefore be quickly driven out to infinity , whereas the behavior near the event horizon is independent of the angular momentum",
    ". however , it seems a very delicate problem to rigorously establish decay rates without the assumption  ( [ eq:1b ] ) , because this would make it necessary to control the dependence of our estimates on @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , we assume that the charge of the black hole is so small that the gravitational attraction is the dominant force at a large distance from the black hole .",
    "more precisely , we shall assume throughout this paper that @xmath45    we now state our main results and discuss them afterwards .",

    "the decay rate of @xmath71 obtained in theorem  [ thm1 ] quantifies the effect of the black hole s gravitational attraction on the long - time behavior of massive dirac particles . before discussing this effect in detail , it is instructive to recall the derivation of the decay rates in minkowski space .",
    "we denote the plane - wave solutions of the dirac equation by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is momentum , @xmath74 is the sign of energy , and @xmath75 refers to the two spin orientations .",
    "the plane - wave solutions are normalized according to @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the usual spatial scalar product @xmath78 the dirac propagator is obtained by decomposing the initial data into the plane - wave solutions , @xmath79 and a straightforward calculation using the explicit form of the plane - wave solutions yields that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the fourier transform of @xmath82 ( and as usual @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the step function @xmath87 ) .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the initial data is a schwartz function .",
    "we write  ( [ eq : i1 ] ) as a fourier integral in @xmath27 , @xmath88 where @xmath89 we consider the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath90 for fixed @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92-distribution gives a contribution to the momentum integral only for @xmath73 on the sphere @xmath93 .",
    "thus @xmath94 vanishes for @xmath38 and has rapid decay at infinity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath90 is clearly smooth in the region @xmath35 . for @xmath95 near @xmath23",
    ", @xmath90 has the expansion @xmath96 a typical plot of @xmath97 is shown in figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "if @xmath98 vanishes in a neighborhood of @xmath99 , then @xmath100 is a schwartz function , and thus its fourier transform  ( [ eq : i2 ] ) has rapid decay .",
    "this is the analogue of case  * ( ii ) * of theorem  [ thm1 ] . however , if @xmath101 , the decay rate is determined by the square root behavior of @xmath90 for @xmath95 near @xmath23 .",
    "a change of variables gives that for any test function @xmath102 which is supported in a neighborhood of the origin , @xmath103 an integration - by - parts argument shows that the last integral is bounded uniformly in @xmath48 , and is non - zero for large @xmath48 if @xmath104 . from this",
    "we conclude that in minkowski space , @xmath105 decays polynomially at the rate @xmath106 .",
    "we now proceed with a more detailed discussion of our results , beginning with the rates of decay obtained in theorem  [ thm1 ] . naively speaking",
    ", a massive dirac particle behaves near the event horizon similar to a massless particle , i.e.  like a solution of the wave equation . in minkowski space , solutions of the wave equation decay",
    "rapidly in time according to the huygens principle . on the other hand , at large distance from the black hole the solutions should behave like those of the massive dirac equation in minkowski space , which decay at the rate @xmath106 .",
    "it is thus tempting to expect that the solutions of the massive dirac equation in the kerr - newman black hole geometry should decay at a rate which `` interpolates '' between the behavior of a massive particle in minkowski space and that of a massless particle , and should thus decay at a rate no slower than @xmath106 .",
    "however , theorem  [ thm1 ] shows that this naive picture is incorrect , since the rate of decay we have established for a massive dirac particle in the kerr - newman black hole geometry is actually slower than that of a massive particle in minkowski space .",
    "thus the gravitational field of the black hole affects the behavior of massive dirac particles in a more subtle way .",
    "one can understand this fact by comparing the plots in figure  [ fig1 ] , which give typical examples for the energy distribution of the dirac wave function in minkowski space and in the kerr - newman geometry .",
    "one sees that in the kerr - newman geometry , there is a contribution to the energy distribution for @xmath38 , which oscillates infinitely fast as @xmath27 approaches @xmath23 .",
    "when taking the fourier transform , these oscillations lead to the decay rate @xmath71 given theorem  [ thm1 ] ( see the rigorous saddle point argument in lemma  [ lemma42 ] ) .",
    "the oscillations in the energy distribution in figure  [ fig1](b ) are a consequence of the field behavior near spatial infinity . on a qualitative level",
    ", they can already be understood in newtonian gravity and the semi - classical approximation .",
    "namely , in the newtonian limit of general relativity , the momentum @xmath73 of a relativistic particle is related to its energy @xmath27 by @xmath107 thus the particle has positive momentum even if @xmath108 , provided that the newtonian potential is large enough , @xmath109 .",
    "this means in the semi - classical approximation that the wave function @xmath110 has an oscillatory behavior near the black hole , @xmath111 and will fall off exponentially for @xmath112 . as a consequence , the fundamental solutions @xmath32 for @xmath38 involve phase factors @xmath113 . in the limit @xmath114 , @xmath115 ,",
    "leading to infinitely fast oscillations in our integral representation .",
    "this simple argument even gives the correct quantitative behavior of the phases @xmath116 .",
    "the fact that the decay rate in the presence of a black hole is slower than in minkowski space has the following direct physical interpretation .",
    "one can view the gravitational attraction of the black hole and the tendency of quantum mechanical wave functions to spread out in space as competing with each other over time .",
    "the component of the wave function for @xmath27 near @xmath23 and @xmath108 , which is responsible for the decay rate @xmath71 , has not enough energy to propagate out to infinity .",
    "but since it is an outgoing wave near the event horizon ( note that in  ( [ eq:1as1 ] ) the fundamental solutions @xmath117 enter only for @xmath37 ) , it is driven outwards and resists the gravitational attraction for a long time before it will eventually be drawn into the black hole . as a result , the dirac particle stays in any compact region of space longer than it would in minkowski space , and thus the rate of decay of the wave function is slower .    according to this interpretation ,",
    "our decay rates are a consequence of the far - field behavior of the black hole .",
    "similar to the `` power law tails '' in the massless case ( see  @xcite ) , our effect can be understood as a `` backscattering '' of the outgoing wave from the long - range potential , but clearly the rest mass drastically changes the behavior of the wave near infinity .",
    "we expect that result for the decay rates should be valid even in a more general setting , independent of the details of the local geometry near the event horizon . furthermore , the decay rates should be independent of the spin .",
    "this view is supported by  @xcite , who obtained the rate @xmath71 for massive scalar fields in a spherically symmetric geometry using asymptotic expansions of the green s functions .",
    "theorem  [ thm2 ] gives a precise formula for the probability that the dirac particle either disappears into the black hole or escapes to infinity . in cases * ( i)**(iv ) * we give sufficient conditions for these probabilities to occur .",
    "these results are consistent with the general behavior of quantum mechanical particles in the presence of a potential barrier and can be thought of as a tunnelling effect . in case * ( iii ) * , the particle does not have enough energy to escape to infinity .",
    "thinking again in terms of a tunnelling effect , the dirac particle can not tunnel to infinity because the potential barrier ( which has finite height @xmath23 ) has infinite width .",
    "finally , one might ask whether @xmath118 can occur ; i.e. , that the particles escapes to infinity with probability one .",
    "this is indeed the case for very special initial data , whose energy distribution is supported outside the interval @xmath68 $ ] ( see corollary  [ cor91 ] below ) .",
    "we conclude by remarking that a number of significant results are known for the long - term behavior of _ massless _ fields in black hole geometries .",
    "these results do not capture our effect , which is intimately related to the presence of a mass gap in the energy spectrum .",
    "price  @xcite discussed the rates of decay of massless fields in the schwarzschild background for special choices of initial data .",
    "his decay rates depend on the angular momentum and are faster than the ones we have derived .",
    "a rigorous proof of the boundedness of the solutions of the wave equation in the schwarzschild geometry has been given by kay and wald  @xcite .",
    "beyer pursues an approach using @xmath119-semigroup theory , which also applies to the kerr metric and the massive case  @xcite .",
    "an important contribution to the long - time behavior of gravitational perturbations of the kerr metric has been given by whiting  @xcite .",
    "we begin the analysis with the case when the energy distribution of the cauchy data is zero in a neighborhood of @xmath120 .",
    "the following theorem is an equivalent formulation of theorem  [ thm1]*(ii)*.    [ thm21 ] consider the cauchy problem @xmath121 for smooth initial data with compact support outside the event horizon .",
