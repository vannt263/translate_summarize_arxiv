    "mould calculus was developed by j.  calle in relation with his resurgence theory almost thirty years ago ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the primary goal of this text is to give an introduction to mould calculus , together with an exposition of the way it can be applied to a specific geometric problem pertaining to the theory of dynamical systems : the analytic classification of saddle - node singularities .",
    "the treatment of this example was indicated in @xcite in concise manner ( see also @xcite ) , but i found it useful to provide a self - contained presentation of mould calculus and detailed explanations for the saddle - node problem , in the same spirit as resurgence theory and alien calculus were presented in @xcite together with the example of the analytic classification of tangent - to - identity transformations in complex dimension  @xmath2 .",
    "basic facts from resurgence theory are also recalled in the course of the exposition , with the hope that this text will serve to a broad readership .",

    "a.   section  [ secsn ] describes the problem of the normalisation of the saddle - node and section  [ secmcexpsn ] outlines its treatment by the method of mould - comould expansions .",
    "b.   the second part has an `` algebraic '' flavour : it is devoted to a systematic exposition of some features of mould algebras ( sections  [ secalgmoulds ] and  [ secaltsym ] ) and mould - comould expansions ( sections  [ secgenmcm ] and  [ seccontraltsym ] ) . c.   the third part is mainly concerned by the applications to resurgence theory of the previous results ( sections  [ secresursn][secmr ]",

    "all the ideas come from j.  calle s articles and lectures .",
    "an effort has been made to provide full details , which occasionally may have resulted in original definitions , but they must be considered as auxiliary with respect tothe overall theory .",
