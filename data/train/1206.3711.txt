    "a random graph is a set of vertices that are connected by random links @xcite .",
    "random graphs underlie numerous natural phenomena ranging from polymerization @xcite to the spread of infectious diseases @xcite , and they also have applications to transportation systems , electrical distribution systems , the internet , the world - wide web , social networks , etc . @xcite .    in random graph models ,",
    "links are usually treated as undirected . in a growing number of applications",
    ", however , directionality plays a prominent role .",
    "one example is modeling of the web growth @xcite .",
    "in modeling of food webs directionality ( reflecting predation ) is even more crucial .",
    "food webs are directed graphs with vertexes @xmath4 labeling different species .",
    "the presence of the directed link @xmath5 indicates that species @xmath6 is eaten by species @xmath7 . usually in food web only links @xmath5 with @xmath8",
    "are allowed .",
    "( loops @xmath9 which would account cannibalism are ignored ; the directed link @xmath5 with @xmath10 could e.g. represent predation on the young of the ` stronger ' species @xmath6 by adults of species @xmath7 , but such links are also disregarded in most models . )",
    "the simplest cascade model @xcite generates a food web at random , namely for each pair of species @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 the directed link @xmath5 is drawn at random with a certain predation probability @xmath11 .",
    "a number of questions , particularly those related to the maximal length of food chains , have been investigated in the framework of the this cascade model .",
    "for instance , what is the length ( the number of links ) of the longest direct path starting from the _ basal _ species ( vertex 0 ) ? a dual question concerns the length of the longest path finishing at the _ top _ species ( vertex @xmath12 ) .",
    "one can also ask about the length @xmath13 of the longest path irrespectively on the first and last species .    the simplest cascade model is a kind of ` standard model ' in the subject , and it had been widely used to interpret ecological data on community food webs @xcite .",
    "the standard cascade model provides a very natural mechanism for generating directed random graphs and the same model has been suggested in other contexts , e.g. as a model of parallel computation @xcite in which the presence of the directed link @xmath5 with @xmath8 indicates that task @xmath6 must be performed before task @xmath7 . for a parallel computation",
    "in which each task takes a unit of time , the processing time will be equal @xmath14 ( where @xmath13 is the length of the the longest path ) .",
    "food webs typically involve a huge number of species , while the average predation per species is usually not too large .",
    "hence it is interesting to investigate large food webs with small predation probability , more precisely the scaling limit @xmath15 this suggests to study a continuum cascade model where the vertex set is the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "for each species @xmath16 , the number of predator species is random , such species are chosen at random from the interval @xmath2 $ ] according to the poisson distribution with unit density .",
    "the poisson distribution immediately follows from the binomial distribution ( characterizing the discrete cascade model ) in the scaling limit .",
    "this cascade model is the minimalist continuum model of directed random graphs .",
    "simple models tend to arise in various unrelated subjects and they are interesting on purely intellectual grounds . nevertheless , for concreteness in the following exposition we shall often use the language of food webs .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we define the model , discuss its simplest properties , and derive a recurrence for the longest directed path starting from the origin .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the solution to that recurrence is analyzed in the following sections [ elem ] and [ t_wave ] . in section [ size_tree ]",
    "we discuss the total number of vertices in a cascade tree with the root at the origin ; on the language of food webs it counts the basal species and species feeding on it , both directly and indirectly .",
    "the vertex set of our random graph is the interval @xmath0 $ ] . in the illustrative picture below we draw only the vertex set and links from the cascade subgraph initiating at the origin ( the open circle on the picture ) .",
    "namely , we draw all links emanating from the origin indicating direct predation on the basal species ( there are 3 such predators in the picture ) ; then we draw all the links from these direct predators ( 4 such predators in the picture ) ; etc .",
    "links are drawn in a cascade manner thereby explaining the name of the model .",

    "the traveling wave profile @xmath40 decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 as @xmath41 increases from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the next section we give an elementary argument which allows one to understand . a more comprehensive traveling wave analysis that leads to above results",

    "this does not prove equation , but at least it shows its consistency with the series .",

    "we assume the convergence to traveling wave solution and the validity of the traveling wave ansatz .",
    "numerical results strongly support this assumption [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : tw ] ] and show that the convergence is rather fast , that is , the asymptotic shape emerges already for not to large @xmath32 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath58 ( for large @xmath32 ) , but we do not specify @xmath59 . the left - hand side of equation becomes @xmath60 while the right - hand side of equation turns into @xmath61 , \\qquad \\eta = y - nv\\ ] ] we will allow @xmath62 to be large , but we will always assume that @xmath63 .",

    "traveling wave solutions have been investigated in the context of partial differential equations .",
    "a few partial differential equations admitting traveling wave solutions have been deeply studied .",
    "one such equation is the celebrated fisher - kpp equation @xcite for which the selection principle had been proven @xcite for sufficiently steep initial conditions .",
    "( for more recent work see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a very comprehensive review of traveling wave solutions of non - linear partial differential equations has been given by van saarloos @xcite , a lighter expositions appear in books @xcite . )",
    "more recently , traveling wave solutions have been investigated in the context of nonlinear recurrences arising in the analyses of binary search algorithms @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite , and other problems @xcite ; see @xcite for a review of the applications of traveling wave techniques to recurrences .",
    "asymptotically , the wave front advances at a constant velocity @xmath88 .",
    "the approach to this asymptotic value is rather slow , namely there is a @xmath89 correction in the leading order , resulting in a logarithmic correction to the front position .",
    "this correction was first established by bramson @xcite for the fisher - kpp equation ; it was subsequently generalized @xcite to more general partial differential equations and to recurrences @xcite .",
    "this correction generally has the form @xmath90 . for the selected velocity @xmath88 ,",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath91 is implied by dispersion relation .",
    "taking into account this logarithmic correction we get @xmath92    it was convenient to think about @xmath37 and @xmath32 as space and time coordinates , so that the front of the traveling wave was advancing and we determined @xmath93 . in the original problem ,",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is fixed and we are interested in the height @xmath94 of the cascade tree .",
    "the height is essentially the inverse to @xmath93 which is taken when @xmath95 .",
    "thus @xmath96 the height is of course a random quantity . equation gives the average height . in the @xmath3 limit",
    ", the average provides a faithful description as it is a growing quantity while the variance remains finite .",
    "we havent proved this assertion , but at least on the physical level of rigor it is obvious : the probability distribution @xmath97 has asymptotically a traveling wave shape with the width of the front remaining finite , and this is essentially equivalent to the finite width of the height distribution .",
    "the size @xmath98 of the cascade tree , that is , the total number of vertices in the tree , is a random variable .",
    "let us compute the average size @xmath99 . from the definition of the continuum cascade model we deduce @xmath100 \\\\\\nonumber & = &   1 + \\sum _ { k=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{x^k } { k!}\\,e^{-x }   k\\int _",

    "the explicit results  show that , in contrast to the height , the size of the cascade tree is the random quantity whose limiting distribution ( in the @xmath3 limit ) remains broad .",
    "more precisely , in the scaling limit @xmath108 the size distribution becomes @xmath109 = e^{-x } f(\\sigma)\\ ] ] with the limiting distribution being different from the delta function , @xmath110 .",
    "the normalization requirement together with  and",
    "similar equations for higher moments @xmath107 show that the moments @xmath111 of the limiting distribution are @xmath112 etc .",
    "we proposed a minimalist model of infinite directed random graphs .",
    "the model is a continuum version of a model of finite directed random graphs , known as the cascade model , which has been investigated in the context of food webs and parallel computation .",
    "our model presumes a total order on the set of vertices .",
    "we chose the simplest such set , an interval of length @xmath37 . from each @xmath1 $ ] , directed links to points @xmath113 are drawn at random according to the poisson distribution , that is , the points @xmath114 $ ] are chosen independently from each other and uniformly with density one .",
    "the analysis of this continuum cascade model is actually simpler than the analysis of the discrete cascade model .",
    "this is demonstrated by studying the distribution of the length of the longest directed paths starting at the origin ( equivalently , the height of the cascade tree with the root at the origin ) .",
    "we employed traveling wave techniques to extract the asymptotic behavior of the length of the longest directed paths in the @xmath3 limit .",
