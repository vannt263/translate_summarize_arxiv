    "yield stress solids flow if a sufficiently large shear stress is applied .",
    "although such materials are ubiquitous and relevant for industry , there is no accepted microscopic description of how they yield . here we propose a scaling description of the yielding transition which relates the flow curve , the statistics of the avalanches of plasticity observed at threshold , and the density of local zones that are about to yield .",
    "our description shares some similarity with the depinning transition that occurs when an elastic manifold is driven through a random potential , but also presents some striking differences .",
    "numerical simulations on a simple elasto - plastic model find good agreement with our predictions .",
    "many solids will flow and behave as fluids if a sufficiently large shear stress is applied . in crystals",
    ", plasticity is governed by the motion of dislocations @xcite . in amorphous solids",
    "there is no order , and conserved defects can not be defined . however , as noticed by argon @xcite , plasticity consists of elementary events localized in space , called shear transformations , where a few particles rearrange .",
    "this observation supports that there are special locations in the sample , called shear transformation zones or stz s @xcite , where the system lies close to an elastic instability .",
    "several theoretical approaches of plasticity , such as stz theory @xcite or soft glassy rheology ( sgr ) @xcite assume that such zones relax independently , or are coupled to each other via an effective temperature .",
    "however , at zero temperature and small applied strain rate @xmath6 , computer experiments @xcite and very recent experiments @xcite indicate that local rearrangements are not independent : plasticity occurs via avalanches in which many shear transformations are involved , forming elongated structures where plasticity localizes .",
    "if conditions are such that flow is homogeneous ( as can occur for example in foams or emulsions ) , one finds that the flow curves are singular at small strain rate and follow a herschel - bulkley law @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these features are qualitatively reproduced by elastoplastic models @xcite where space is discretized . in these models ,",
    "a site that yields plastically affects the stress in its surroundings via some interaction kernel @xmath8 , argued to decay as a power - law of distance and to display a four - fold symmetry @xcite , as supported by observations @xcite .",
    "this perturbation can trigger novel plastic events and lead to avalanches .",
    "however , even within this picture , the relationship between the avalanche dynamics and the singularity of the flow curves remains debated @xcite .",
    "[ f11 ]     it is tempting to seek progress by building a comparison between the yielding transition and the much better understood depinning transition that occurs when an elastic interface of dimension @xmath9 is driven in a @xmath10 random environment @xcite . the role that transverse displacements play in depinning corresponds to the local accumulated plastic strain @xmath11 and the total plastic strain @xmath12 can be identified with the center of mass of the interface , as illustrated in fig.([f11 ] ) .",
    "both phenomena display very similar properties : near the depinning threshold force @xmath13 , the velocity @xmath14 vanishes non - analytically @xmath15 and the interplay between disorder and elasticity at threshold leads to broadly distributed avalanches corresponding to jerky motions of the interface . much more is known about the depinning transition : it is a dynamical critical point characterized by two independent exponents related to avalanche extension and duration @xcite .",
    "these exponents have been computed perturbatively with the functional renormalisation group @xcite and evaluated numerically with high precision @xcite.the comparison between these two phenomena has led to the proposition that the yielding transition is in the universality class of mean - field depinning @xcite .",
    "however , experiments find a reological exponent @xmath16 against the @xmath17 predicted for elastic depinning , and numerical simulations display intriguing finite size effects that differ from depinning @xcite .",
    "formally , elastoplastic models are very similar to automaton models known to capture well the depinning transition @xcite , the key difference relies in the interaction kernel @xmath18 , long - ranged and of variable sign for elastoplastic models while is essentially a laplacian for depinning with short - range elasticity .",
    "we have recentely shown @xcite that in presence of long - ranged with variable sign interactions the distribution of shear transformations at a distance @xmath2 from instability , @xmath1 , is singular with @xmath19 , unlike in depinning for which @xmath20 . as we shall recall",
    "this singularity naturally explains the finite size effects observed in simulations . in this letter we argue that once this key difference with depinning is taken into account , the analogy between these two phenomena is fruitful , and leads to a complete scaling description of the yielding transition . in particular we find that the herschel - bulkley exponent is related to avalanche extension and duration via eq.([beta ] ) and that the avalanche statistics can be expressed in term of three independent exponents : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , characterizing respectively the density of shear transformations , the fractal dimension of the avalanches , and their duration .",
    "several studies ( see table 2 ) have characterized the yielding transition with several exponents , which we now recall .",
    "_ flow curves : _ rheological properties are singular near the yielding transition .",
    "herschel and bulkley noticed @xcite that for many yield stress materials , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the macroscopic strain rate and @xmath23 is the external shear stress .",
    "by analogy with depinning we instead introduce the exponent @xmath24 , such that [ 1 ] ~(-_c)^. in contrast to depinning , one finds @xmath16 in the yielding transition , as we explain below .",
    "our analysis below focuses on the regime @xmath25 ; effects not discussed here are expected to affect the flow curves at larger stresses@xcite .    _ length scales : _ near the yielding transition the dynamics becomes more and more cooperative , and is correlated on a length scale @xmath26 : [ 2 ] ~|-_c|^- _ avalanche statistics : _ at threshold @xmath27 , the dynamics occur by avalanches whose size we define as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the plastic strain increment due to the avalanche , and @xmath30 is the volume of the system . the normalized avalanche distribution @xmath31 follows a power - law : [ 4 ] ( s)~s^- in a finite system of size @xmath32 , this distribution is cut - off at some value @xmath33 , where the linear extension of the avalanche is of order @xmath32 , enabling to define the fractal dimension @xmath4 : [ 7 ] s_c~l^d_f    a key exponent relates length- and time- scales . @xmath5",
    "characterizes the duration @xmath34 of an avalanche whose linear extension is @xmath35 : [ 5 ] t~l^z    _ density of shear transformations : _ if an amorphous solid is cut into small blocks containing several particles , one can define how much stress @xmath36 needs to be applied to the block @xmath37 before an instability occurs .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath1 is a measure of how many putative shear transformations are present in the sample @xcite . near the depinning transition , a similar quantity can be defined , and in that case it is well known that @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we have argued @xcite that it must be so when the interaction kernel @xmath18 is _ monotonic _ , i.e. its sign is constant in space . for an elastic interface",
    "this is the case , as a region that yields will always destabilize other regions .",
    "this implies that locally the distance to instability @xmath36 always decreases with time , until @xmath39 when the block @xmath37 rearranges .",
    "thus nothing in the dynamics allows the block @xmath37 to forecast that an instability approaches , and no depletion nor accumulation is expected to occur near @xmath40 . by contrast for the yielding transition , the sign of @xmath18 varies in space .",
    "thus locally @xmath36 jumps both forward and backward , performing some kind of random walk . since @xmath41 acts as an absorbing boundary condition ( as the site",
    "is stabilized by a finite amount once it yields ) , one expects that depletion can occur near @xmath41 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we argued that @xmath1 must indeed vanish at @xmath41 if the interaction is sufficiently long - range ( in particular if @xmath42 , as is the case for the yielding transition ) , otherwise the system would be unstable : a small perturbation at the origin would cause extensive rearrangements in the system .",
    "thus the yielding transition is affected by an additional exponent @xmath3 that does not enter the phenomenology of depinning problem : [ 3 ] p(x)~x^ with @xmath43 . using elastoplastic models we previously measured @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 @xcite , as we confirm here with improved statistics .",
    "the definitions of the relevant exponents are summarized in table [ exponents ] , and their values as reported in the literature in table [ table2 ] .",
    "[ illustration ]",
    "we now propose several scaling relations , which essentially mirror arguments made in the context of the depinning transition ( see supplementary information ( s.i . ) ) , with the additional feature that @xmath1 is singular .",
    "_ stationarity : _ consider applying a quasi - static strain in a system of linear size @xmath32 , as represented in fig.([stressstrain ] ) .",
    "the stress @xmath23 fluctuates due to avalanches : an avalanche of size @xmath48 leads to a stress drop proportional to the plastic strain @xmath49 , of average @xmath50 . using eqs.([4],[7 ] ) and assuming @xmath51 one gets @xmath52 , so that the average drop of stress is of order @xmath53 .    in between plastic events , the system loads elastic energy , and stress rises by some typical amount @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath54 is limited by the next plastic event , and is thus inversely proportional to the rate at which avalanches are triggered . although one might think that if the system is twice larger , a plastic event will occur twice sooner ( implying @xmath55 ) , this is not the case and @xmath56 depends on system size with a non - trivial exponent @xcite .",
    "as argued in @xcite , one expects @xmath54 to be of order @xmath57 , the weakest site in the system .",
    "if the @xmath36 are independent this implies that @xmath58 .",
    "in @xcite it was argued based on local considerations that @xmath59 .",
    "instead our recent work @xcite implies that @xmath3 is governed by the elastic interactions between plastic events , and remains a non - trivial exponent that depends on interaction range and spatial dimension .",
    "imposing that in a stationary state the average drop and jump of stress must be equal leads to @xmath60 @xcite ; using our estimate of the latter we get @xmath61 , leading to our first scaling relation : @xmath62 as discussed in s.i .",
    ", a similar but not identical relation holds also for the depinning transition @xcite .",
    "_ dynamics : _ a powerful idea in the context of the depinning transition is that avalanches below threshold and flow above threshold are intimately related @xcite . above threshold , the motion of the interface can be thought as consisting of a number of individual avalanches of spatial extension @xmath26 , acting in parallel .",
    "we propose the same image for the yielding transition .",
    "if so , the strain rate @xmath63 in the sample is simply equal to the characteristic strain rate of an avalanche of size @xmath26 , leading to : @xmath64 implying our second scaling relation , which to our knowledge was not proposed in this context : @xmath65    _ statistical tilt symmetry : _ if flow above @xmath0 consists of independent avalanches of size @xmath26 , then the avalanche - induced fluctuations of stress on that lengthscale , @xmath66 , must be of order : [ 12 ] ~s_c/^d~(-_c)^(d - d_f ) one expects that the fluctuations of stress on the scale @xmath26 must be of order of the distance to threshold @xmath67 .",
    "eq.([12 ] ) then leads to : [ s3 ] = it was suggested in @xcite that eq.([s3 ] ) may apply at the yielding transition .",
    "a similar relation holds for depinning of an interface if the elasticity is assumed to be linear , a non - trivial assumption underlying eq.([12 ] ) . in that case",
    "it can be derived using the so - called statistical - tilt - symmetry . in s.i . , we discuss evidence that linearity applies at the yielding transition , enabling us to use this symmetry to derive eq.([s3 ] ) .",
    "overall the scaling relations eqs.([s1],[beta],[s3 ] ) allow to express the six exponents we have introduced in terms of three , which we choose to be @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding relations are indicated in table [ exponents ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      our scaling relations can now be tested , and this comparison is shown in table [ exponents ] .",
    "we find very good agreements for all the three scaling relations , eq.([s1],[beta],[s3 ] ) .",
    "although elastoplastic models are well - suited to test theories , they make many simplifications , and thus may not fall in the universality class of real materials .",
    "one encouraging item is our estimate of @xmath3 , which is very similar to the value extracted from finite size effects in md simulations using overdamped dynamics , as reported in table.[table2 ] .",
    "this is consistent with our finding @xcite that @xmath3 ( and @xmath69 ) is independent of the choice of dynamical rules in our model , that can however dramatically affect the dynamics . concerning the latter , our choice that the interaction is instantaneous in time , while still being long - range , is likely to affect the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath70 .",
    "we expect that if a more realistic time - dependent interaction kernel @xmath71 is considered ( a costly choice numerically ) , the exponent @xmath5 will satisfy @xmath72 . according to eq.([beta ] ) , this will lead to larger values of @xmath70 , in agreement with experiments .",
    "the scaling relations for @xmath69 and @xmath73 in table [ exponents ] appear to be supported by md simulations . in @xcite for overdamped dynamics , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath47 , whereas @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath45 , leading to @xmath78 in both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which compares well to their measured value @xmath81 . in @xmath47 ,",
    "all numerics @xcite report @xmath82 , leading to @xmath83 as observed in @xcite . in @xmath45 , there is some disagreement on the value of @xmath4 : @xcite report @xmath84 as we do in our elasto - plastic model , in disagreement with @xcite for which @xmath85 , implying that @xmath86",
    ". it would be useful to resolve this discrepancy , since in the depinning problem , when @xmath86 another length scale enters in the scaling description , which affects in particular finite size effects @xcite .",
    "in this situation however , we expect our scaling description to be unchanged if @xmath73 is meant to characterize the correlations of the dynamics for @xmath87 .",
    "we have proposed a scaling description of stationary flow in soft amorphous solids , and it is interesting to reflect if this approach can apply to other systems .",
    "plasticity in crystals shares many similarities with that of amorphous solids , and the far - field effect of a moving dislocation is essentially identical to the effect of a shear - transformation @xcite .",
    "thus we expect that the stability argument of @xcite on the density of regions about to yield also applies in crystals , leading to a non - trivial exponent @xmath3 in that case too .",
    "our scaling relations may thus hold in crystals , although the formation of structures such as domain walls could strongly affect the yielding transition .",
    "avalanches of plasticity are seen in granular materials where particles are hard @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that at least for over - damped systems this behavior is only transient , and that the elasto - plastic description does not apply for such materials under continuous shear . some of us have argued that in that case , a picture based on geometry applies @xcite , which also leads to a diverging length scale , but of a different nature @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations proposed here do not fix the values of the exponents , in particular that of @xmath3 . to make progress",
    ", it is tempting to seek a mean - field description of this problem , that would apply beyond some critical dimension .",
    "current mean - field models in which the interaction is random and does not decay with distance lead to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "however , the anisotropy is lost in this view , and the fact that @xmath3 diminishes as @xmath9 increases when anisotropy is considered suggests that a mean - field model that includes anisotropy is needed .",
    "such a model would be valuable to build a hydrodynamic description of flow , that would apply for example for slow flow near walls @xcite , a problem for which current descriptions do not include the role of anisotropy @xcite .",

    "using the extremal dynamics protocol , the system evolves to the critical point with an average stress @xmath89 and stress fluctuations @xmath90 in the stationary state with a dependence of system size as eq.(13 ) in the main text . in the insets of fig.([quasistress ] ) , we plot out the @xmath91 as a function of @xmath92 , and the critical stress in the thermodynamic limit is just the intersection of the curves with @xmath93 axis , and we get @xmath94 for @xmath47 and @xmath95 for @xmath45 . from the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath32 , shown in fig.([quasistress ] ) , we also extract @xmath96 in @xmath79 and @xmath97 in @xmath80 .",
    "at fixed stress in a finite size system , the dynamics will eventually stop . to trigger a new avalanche",
    "we give random kicks to all sites , of amplitude @xmath98 , while keeping @xmath23 fixed .",
    "we consider two methods . in the first one ,",
    "a site @xmath37 is chosen randomly , and the amplitude of the kicks follows : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a constant adjusting the amplitude of kicks .",
    "data presented in the text correspond to @xmath101 , but choosing smaller values of @xmath100 such as @xmath102 did not affect the results , see fig.([avalanchecheck ] ) .",
    "eq.([111 ] ) ensures that the stress is constant .",
    "if no sites become unstable , another site is chosen randomly and another set of kicks following eq.([111 ] ) are given . in this method , the site @xmath103 that eventually becomes unstable was typically close to an instability before the random kicks were given .",
    "however @xmath103 is not necessarily the weakest site in the entire system .    in the second method ,",
    "the dynamics is triggered by imposing that the weakest site @xmath104 ( i.e. @xmath105 for all @xmath106 ) yields .",
    "according to our automaton model this leads to a change of local distance to instability everywhere in the system , which follows @xmath107 and can lead to avalanches .",
    "we find that these two methods give consistent results for @xmath69 , as shown in fig.([avalanchecheck ] ) .",
    "our estimations of the threshold @xmath0 and the correlation length exponent @xmath73 are obtained in the main text using the extremal dynamics protocol .",
    "we obtain the same results if we use the fixed stress protocol , with which we can compute the size - dependent flow curve relating the strain rate , @xmath22 , as a function of the external stress , @xmath23 . from general arguments of finite size scaling ,",
    "we expect : @xmath108 to test the consistency of our methods , in fig.([strainratecollapse ] ) we collapse the different flow curves using eq.([collapse ] ) and the value of @xmath0 , @xmath73 and @xmath70 initially obtained with the extremal dynamics protocol . we observe a satisfying collapse without any free parameter .",
    "to extract the avalanche distribution exponent @xmath69 accurately , we compare two protocols : ( i ) constant stress at @xmath0 and ( ii ) extremal dynamics , as shown in fig.([avalanchefinitesize ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the avalanche distributions in extremal dynamics have stronger finite size effects than at constant stress .",
    "it is thus difficult to extract the avalanche exponent @xmath69 accurately using extremal dynamics . from the inset of fig.([avalanchefinitesize])(right ) , @xmath69 does nt change significantly with system sizes in the constant stress method , in contrast to the estimate of @xmath69 that increases with @xmath32 in extremal dynamics . to extract @xmath69 accurately",
    ", we fix the stress at @xmath0 to collect the avalanche statistics , and we find @xmath109 in @xmath79 , and @xmath110 in @xmath80 , and the value of @xmath69 is the same for the two methods of fixed stress protocol , and also insensitive to the value of @xmath100 in the first method , shown in fig.([avalanchecheck ] ) . the error associated to the exponent is estimated by varying the range of avalanche sizes considered in the fit .",
    "the three scaling relations derived in the main text for the critical exponents of the yielding transition are similar but not identical to the scaling relations obtained for the depinning transition of an elastic interface . in the following",
    "we derive three more general relations , namely @xmath111 that hold both for yielding and depinning . here",
    "@xmath112 is the dimension of the interaction kernel @xmath113 . in the context of the yielding transition @xmath114 and @xmath115 so that @xmath16 . in the context of the depinning transition @xmath20 and @xmath116 , the dimension of the interaction kernel is @xmath117 for short range elasticity and @xmath118 for the long range elasticity of the contact line of a liquid meniscus @xcite or of the crack front in brittle materials @xcite .",
    "note that the relations ( [ beta ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) are expected to be very general , while the first relation is guaranteed only in presence of statistical - tilt - symmetry , hence only when the interactions are linear .",
    "for example , it is known that the non - harmonic corrections to the elastic energy can modify the universal behaviour of the depinning transition with critical exponents that violate the relation ( [ sts ] ) @xcite . for the yielding transition the validity of ( [ sts ] )",
    "is supported by recent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite that show that the stress decay during an avalanche is proportional to the energy jump , a scaling consistent with linear elasticity .",
    "such linearity is assumed a priori in elasto - plastic models , and is required for the statistical - tilt - symmetry to apply , see below .",
    "the @xmath9 dimensional elasto - plastic model studied in this paper is a discrete automaton .",
    "its continuum limit gives the time evolution of the strain field @xmath119 in each point of the space : @xmath120 the first term of the equation describes the interactions between the different parts of the system .",
    "note that the interactions are linear in the strain field @xmath12 , and governed by a time - independent interaction kernel , @xmath121 . as discussed in the main text , for elastic depinning models",
    "the kernel is _ monotonic _ , while for amorphous materials it is _ non - monotonic _ , anisotropic and can be conveniently written in the fourier space : @xmath122 the other two terms are the external stress , @xmath23 , and the quenched disorder , @xmath123 , which takes into account the inhomogeneities of the local yield stress . in the automaton model",
    "the scalar stress @xmath124 corresponds to the sum of the first two terms , and @xmath123 is assumed to be a collection of narrow wells randomly located along @xmath125 .",
    "the parameters @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are related respectively to the well depth , to the distance between consecutive wells and to the time needed to move from an unstable well to a stable one .    below threshold , @xmath129 ,",
    "the local strain fields are pinned inside a set of narrow wells . if a small perturbation is applied ( e.g. a little change in the well locations )",
    ", the local strain field responds either ( almost everywhere ) linearly simply readjusting its value inside the well , either ( when a well becomes unstable ) with a large modification accompanied by a stress release that can be the seed of a large avalanche .",
    "this non - linear response gives a singular contribution to the susceptibility which becomes important close to @xmath0 .",
    "note that in presence of a _ non - monotonic _ interaction kernel , the avalanche size @xmath130 can be positive or negative , however the positive external stress @xmath23 strongly suppress negative avalanches that can , in practice , be neglected .",
    "we now focus on the response of the system when we add to eq.([eq_continuum ] ) a tilt , @xmath131 , namely an inhomogeneous local stress of zero spatial average . in presence of linear interactions",
    ", the tilt can be absorbed in a new strain filed @xmath132 defined as @xmath133 and governed by the following evolution equation @xmath134 the latter equation points out that the effect of the tilt can be absorbed with a shift of the location of the narrow wells .",
    "thus , once the average over disorder is taken , the tilt disappears from eq.([tiltless ] ) if the correlation @xmath135 only depend on @xmath136 .",
    "for example in the steady state , when the system becomes independent of the initial conditions , the average response of @xmath137 to a tilt @xmath138 acting on the mode @xmath139 , is @xmath140 this exact expression should be compared with the scaling behaviour of the singular part of the susceptibility governed by the characteristic scale @xmath141 . in this regime",
    "the strain field grows as @xmath142 and noting that the tilt has the dimension of a stress , we expect that the singular part of the susceptibility scales as @xmath143 , which gives @xmath144 , namely eq.([sts ] ) . here",
    "@xmath112 is the dimension of the kernel @xmath145 . for short range elastic depinning @xmath117 , for long range depinning @xmath118 , while the anisotropic kernel one has @xmath114 .",
    "concerning the other two scaling relations : eq.([beta ] ) is identical to the one derived in the main text and eq.([tau ] ) is still a consequence of the stationarity of the avalanche dynamics",
    ". in general an avalanche of size s leads to a stress drop which is not simply proportional to the plastic strain , but rather to @xmath146 , so that the average stress drop induced by avalanches scales as @xmath147 on the other hand the stress injection before observing a new avalanche scales as @xmath148 , so that @xmath149 finally , using @xmath150 we obtain eq.([tau ] ) ."
