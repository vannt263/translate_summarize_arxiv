    "their contribution to the fourier transform of the correlation function will be very small for large @xmath20 unless @xmath22 is very near zero .",
    "the fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "if they are also stationary ( depending only on @xmath23 ) , then the fluctuations can be regarded as thermal , with a possibly frequency dependent temperature .",
    "as bl showed , for a detector of massless scalar radiation in circular orbit , the temperature of the fluctuations is given by figure 3 .",
    "the temperature is frequency dependent , and is scattered around the value expected from equation 1 for linear acceleration .",
    "however , just because the temperature is not frequency independent , does not make it act any the less like a temperature especially if the detector responds only to a narrow range of frequencies .",
    "the more important aspects are the lack of correlation between the fluctuations at the various frequencies ( which comes from the stationarity of the correlation function ) and the gaussian nature of those fluctuations .    for a scalar detector in circular orbit ,",
    "the effective temperature of the scalar field fluctuations turns out to be    t()= ( 1 + 4a_c e^ 2a_c ) thus , for low @xmath22 , the temperature is t while for high @xmath22 , it is approximately t figure 4 gives a plot of @xmath24 vs @xmath25 .",

    "the estimation of the response is now simple .",
    "the detector is in contact with a thermal bath , and at long times , one would expect it to come into equilibrium with that bath with the same temperature @xmath26 describing its internal state .",
    "this is born out for a scalar detector ( where for example the response of a harmonic oscillator like internal detector can be solved exactly ) .",
    "if the coupling becomes too strong , then of course the internal state is no longer at the naive temperature due to correlation effects between the bath and the detector@xcite .",
    "however all situations of interest to us will be well within the weak coupling regime .",
    "jackson@xcite has criticized the use of the equilibrium polarisation of the spin of an electron in a storage ring as a detector of the thermal nature of the field as seen by an accelerated observer .",
    "even bell and leinaas in their second paper raise doubts about regarding the residual polarisation as a measure of the temperature of the thermal bath seen by a circularly accelerating electron .",
    "the distribution amongst the states of the spin simply does not look thermal , given the interaction of the spin with the field .",
    "however they do not explain why the detector response differs from the naive explanation .",
    "the expectation that the spin polarisation should simply have a distribution which corresponds to the thermal distribution of the field is too naive .",
    "one must understand both the interaction of the spin with the bath and with other degrees of freedom of the system itself .",
    "after all , the snow seen on the screen of a tv set has a temperature vastly higher than the room temperature fluctuations which cause it , due to the interaction with other components ( eg , amplifiers , etc ) . the fact that the observed temperature is so much higher than the temperature which causes the snow is not a failure of the tv set to act as a detector of thermal fluctuations , but rather a failure to understand how the tv set works .",
    "as we shall see , the electron also has similar complex behaviour including time dependent couplings which act as  amplifiers \" .",
    "the first question to ask is whether or not the electromagnetic field appears to be a thermal field to the circularly accelerating observer .",
    "clearly the fluctuations are gaussian , since they are simply the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , which are gaussian .",
    "thus the key question is whether or not they are stationary .",
    "ie , is the two - point correlation function of the fields a function only of the difference in times , or does it also depend on the absolute time ?    for the scalar field this question is easily answered in the affirmative , but the electromagnetic field , being a vector field , has the additional complication of needing to have the components one is correlating be specified first .",
    "ie , even for a static observer in the vacuum , the correlation function @xmath27 is not stationary for arbitrary time dependent unit vector @xmath28 . in the case of the circular acceleration case as there are numerous frames in which one could calculate the correlation function between the components of the electromagnetic field .",
    "three in particular spring to mind , namely the inertial system of basis vectors ( ie , parallel transported along the curve ) , the rotating system ( which rotates at the same rate as the particle revolves around the circle ) or the fermi - walker transported system .",
    "since each of these sets of basis vectors rotates with respect to the other , one would expect that only one of them will be the one ( if any ) in which the fluctuations are stationary .",
    "the answer is that it is the basis set which co - rotates with the particle .",
    "one can define a killing vector field , a sum of time translation and rotation ^= ( 1,-y , x,0 ) such that the particle follows one of the integral curves of this killing vector field .",
    "it will then be the components of the electromagnetic field as lie transported along this field which will be stationary .",
    "( since the vacuum state is invariant both under time translations and rotations , it is also invariant under this killing transformation )",
    ". however , the electron effectively couples to only a few of these components .",
    "it will thus turn out for the electron that it is the correlation functions in the fw frame which are important , and the particular components of importance will again be stationary in that frame .",

    "these lead to the polarisation curve of figure 1 .",
    "there are a number of points which must be emphasised .",
    "the first is that it is the transverse oscillations of the electron which drive the extra terms in the transition . in the above",
    "i assumed that the only effects which drive those transverse oscillations are the vacuum fluctuations of the electric field in the rest frame of the particle .",
    "if there are other sources of noise which drive those transverse oscillations ( field misalignments , interactions with other particles in the beam , etc ) then those will all also contribute to the spin polarisation .",
    "( note that the action of the spin system on the oscillator is not a source of significant noise .",
    "the coupling between the spin and the harmonic oscillator  reduced to dimensionless variables is of order @xmath124 which is clearly tiny .",
    "the only reason the oscillator effects the spin is that its coupling to the electric field in the same units is enhanced by the factor @xmath125 over the direct coupling between the magnetic fluctuations and the spin , compensating for the weakness of the coupling between the two systems ) .    secondly , for @xmath5 the factor @xmath126 is unity except at the resonance .",
    "however for @xmath4 not equal to 2 , the system behaves very differently below the resonance than above .    in the co - rotating frame , the transition rates caused by the direct coupling to the local magnetic field , and the transition rate induced by the motion of the electron have very different forms .",
    "the direct transition rate is centered at g=0 ( figure 5 ) while those for the oscillator are centered at g=2 .",
    "the final polarisation curve is thus a mixture of the two , resulting in the shift to about @xmath127 of figure 1 . also , the relative weights of the two terms shift with frequency , giving the fine structure in the figure 1 .",
    "i have argued that both detectors are immersed in essentially identical temperature heat baths .",
    "why would the interaction not then not bring the joint system to the same joint temperature ?",
    "the important point here is that the fermi - walker frame is the natural frame for the spin , and is the frame in which the fluctuations look thermal .",
    "however , the interaction is static in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the @xmath33 oscillations and @xmath121 are unaffected by the transformation to the fw frame , and thus in this frame both systems independently have the same distribution . however , in that frame , the interaction between the oscillator and the heat bath is no longer static , but is time dependent .",
    "( although @xmath97 is unaffected by the transformation , the coupling is through @xmath128 and @xmath129 which * do * change under the transformation . )    because of this time dependent coupling , the harmonic system tends to preferentially drive up - transitions in the spin system ( and the spin system preferentially drives down - transitions in the oscillator ) .",
    "the coupling acts like an amplifier , driving the spin system to its higher energy state ( at least for @xmath130 ) .",
    "the power for this amplifier clearly comes from the motion around the storage ring .",
    "the electron system thus acts like the snow on the tv screen . without understanding the details of the system",
    ", one can not conclude that the lack of thermal output ( the spin s polarisation is not thermally distributed ) in the detector demonstrates a lack of thermal input ( the fluctuations in the relevant components of the em field in the fw frame ) .    in both dk and jackson",
    ", the claim appears to be that the standard result is obtained for calculating the spin flip by the fluctuations with the electron assumed to be travelling along the fiducial circular path ( see eqn 44 - 47 in jackson and the first equation in section 5 for dk ) .",
    "however in both cases they assume that the fluctuating quantum fields cause a thomas precession .",
    "they use the thomas - bmt equations for the evolution of the spin , which assume that the fields drive the accelerations away from the fiducial path which drives the thomas precession . however , this extra thomas precession , caused by the quantum fields , is a kinematic effect , and arises soley because of deviations in the electron s orbit .",
    "neither jackson nor dk explicitely examines the behaviour of the electron deviations from the fiducial orbit in computing the standard ( figure 1 ) depolarisation for an electron .",
    "their calculations thus effectively assume that @xmath131and that @xmath132 .",
    "also , in my derivation above , i set @xmath114 which meant that the thomas precession terms due to the @xmath33 motion depended only on the velocity in the @xmath33 direction . on the other hand , by using the tbmt equations , jackson and dk have an acceleration dependent term in their equations ( which they then set equal to the forces exerted on the particle by the vacuum fields to get the tbmt equations ) .",
    "they were thus implicitely taking @xmath133 , which makes the thomas precession terms depend only on the @xmath33 acceleration .",
    "however , if one kept the @xmath115 dependent terms in @xmath113 , this would add terms of the form @xmath134 to @xmath135 . but @xmath136 enters the equations for the spin flip probabilities integrated with @xmath137 , which transforms @xmath138 to @xmath139 and converts the @xmath100 dependent terms in @xmath136 to zero .",
    "unruh and wald @xcite examined the behaviour of a detector under uniform acceleration , and in particular the emission of radiation by such a detector .",
    "we looked at two cases in particular . in the one case we asked for the state of the field under the condition that a two level detector was found at the end of the process to have been excited . in this case",
    "they found that the field was in a single particle excited state .",
    "that single particle was concentrated in the region which did not have causal contact with the detector . in the case where the detector was found after the experiment to be unexcited ,",
    "the field was in a coherent superposition of an unexcited vacuum state , and a two particle excited state .    here",
    "i will examine the question from a slightly different point of view .",
    "the detector is taken to be a harmonic oscillator as above .",
    "i will ask what the state is of the radiation field ( the massless scalar field ) without any measurement of the state of the detector .",
    "the equation of motion for an internal oscillator coupled to a scalar field is q + 2 ^ 2 q + ^2 q= _ 0 + _",
    "t^2-^2 = q()^4(x^-x^())dwhere @xmath140 are the coordinates of the particle at proper time @xmath10 , and = _ 0 + ( x^-x^())dwith @xmath141 the retarded green s function .",
    "the solution for @xmath142 is q(t)= ^ e^(- ) _ 0( ) d while the solution for the field @xmath143 is ( t , x)= _ 0(t , x ) + q()(t - t ( ) ) ( ( t - t())^2-(x - x())^2 ) die , the final outgoing field is a linear function of the ingoing field .",
    "this implies that the annihilation and creation operators or the outgoing field are linear combinations of those for the ingoing field .",
    "if the outgoing annihilation operators were functions only of the ingoing annihilation operators , which is what happens when the particle is unaccelerated , then the state of the outgoing field will be indistinguishable from the vacuum state .",
    "on the other hand , if the outgoing field s",
    "( @xmath143 s ) annihilation operators are function of both the ingoing field s",
    "( @xmath144 s ) annihilation and creation operators , then that outgoing field will in general by a  squeezed state \" with respect to the outgoing vacuum state .",
    "a squeezed state has the property that it is a coherent sum of even numbers of particle states .",
    "ie , the detector  scatters \" the vacuum fluctuations in the field @xmath144 so as to produce correlated pairs of particles in the outgoing state .",
    "since this state is again a gaussian state , it is completely characterised by the pairwise correlation function @xmath145 .",

    "<S> this temperature is given by t= a2 ( c k ) since it requires an acceleration of @xmath0 cm / sec@xmath1 to produce a temperature of @xmath2 the experimental verification of this prediction is difficult , although recent advances in the laser acceleration of electrons promise to produce accelerations of over a 100 times this value@xcite . these would give effective temperatures of the order of room temperature , but for very short times . </S>",
    "<S> those brief intense accelerations make it difficult to measure the effects of the thermal bath on the object .    </S>",
    "<S> as was pointed out by bell and leinaas@xcite , the spin of an electron in a magnetic field is a possible candidate for a detector of acceleration radiation . </S>",
    "<S> such an electron has two energy levels , and an examination of the population of those two energy levels after a long time can be used to measure the bath that the electron sees itself in at the larmour precession frequency .    since even room temperature corresponds to very low frequencies ( compared with the compton frequency of the electron ) , and since dipole radiation is suppressed by the third power of the frequency , the use of the electron spin as a detector of the acceleration bath requires a very long period of acceleration to produce an effect . </S>",
    "<S> bell and leinaas@xcite therefore suggested that circular accelerations ( placing the electron into a circular orbit ) be used instead . in an electron storage ring , the acceleration experienced by the electrons in the bending magnets corresponds to high temperature(about @xmath3k for hera ) , and relatively short decay times ( about half an hour).the electron can be kept in the storage ring for that time and be expected to equilibrate with the thermal bath . they thus suggested that the residual polarisation of the electrons is therefore a measure of the temperature of the bath seen by the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> jackson@xcite however has raised serious doubts about the use of a thermal model to explain the residual polarisation of the electrons in such storage rings . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , he has argued that the details of the polarisation of the electron as a function of the @xmath4 factor found by derbenev and kondratenko@xcite ( hereafter dk ) and himself@xcite as plotted in figure 1 , made such a thermal explanation highly suspect . </S>",
    "<S> zero polarisation does not occur at zero coupling with the field by the spin ( ie , zero g factor ) nor at zero anomalous coupling ( @xmath5 ) but at about @xmath6 . furthermore , there are details in the polarisation curve which do not resemble what one would expect from the equilibration with a thermal bath .    </S>",

    "<S> i will restrict myself to the electron s travelling at constant velocity in a constant magnetic field ( ie , i assume that some tangential electric field is present to make up for the energy lost in synchrotron radiation ) . </S>",
    "<S> my conclusion is that the electron does respond to a thermal bath , but one with a frequency dependent temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the electron is actually a system with two field detectors , which are furthermore coupled to each other . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the spin there are the vertical fluctuations in the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> a simple coupling should present no difficulties for understanding the system , but in this case that coupling is also time dependent ( in the radiating frame of the spin ) . </S>",
