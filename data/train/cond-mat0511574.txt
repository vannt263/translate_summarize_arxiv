    "recent years have witnessed an increasing interest for spintronics devices and for their possible application as novel elements in microelectronics industry @xcite .",
    "read - heads based on the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect @xcite have already revolutionized the hard - drives market and other magnetic devices such as magnetic random access memory ( mram ) are expected to have a similar or even bigger impact .",
    "these devices exploit both the magnetic and the electronic properties of conducting materials .    in the typical spin - valve geometry a non - magnetic spacer",
    "is sandwiched between two magnetic contacts .",
    "these provide a source of spin - polarized electrons and the device practically behaves as a polarizer / analyzer spin filter , with the magnetization vector establishing the polarization axis .",
    "typically the resistance of the device is higher when the magnetization vectors of the contacts are aligned antiparallel to each other , and drops when the alignment is parallel .",
    "the non - magnetic spacer controls the total resistance of the device and the overall transport regime ( diffusive , ballistic , tunneling , etc . ) , while the quality and nature of the interfaces can further affect the spin polarization .",
    "many suggestions for possible non - magnetic spacers have been recently proposed @xcite . among the most intriguing",
    "there is the possibility of using organic molecules @xcite .",
    "these offer low fabrication costs and high manufacturability typical of molecular electronics @xcite and the advantage of long spin - relaxation times .",
    "several prototypes for molecular spin - valves have been already fabricated and gmr in excess of 10% have been reported for spacers such as @xmath1-conjugated molecules @xcite and in organic tunneling junctions @xcite .",
    "electron conduction through these systems is always explained in terms of elastic transport @xcite and inelastic effects are often neglected .",
    "this may be a quite drastic simplification in particular in the case of thick organic spacers , for which the transmission due to direct tunneling becomes negligible .",
    "inelastic scattering not only does open new transport channels but also affects the transmission of the elastic ones by introducing competition for the same final states due to the pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "these effects can change drastically the conducting properties of the devices and affect the gmr of spin - valves .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical works have already shown the importance of the inelastic scattering in different non - magnetic molecular devices @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the effects of inelastic scattering on the transport properties of model spin - valves .",
    "first , we briefly introduce our method for calculating the @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristics of a typical two probe device in presence of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this is based on a combination of scattering theory in a green s function framework @xcite and a self - consistent evaluation of the non - equilibrium electron distribution @xcite .",
    "then we show a typical calculation by investigating the transport properties of the h@xmath0 molecule sandwiched between two platinum leads .",
    "finally we consider the case of organic spin - valves obtained by sandwiching a mono - atomic chain , resembling the properties of a ( ch)@xmath4 molecule , between half - metallic leads .",
    "for this system we consider a model @xmath5 half metal ( according to the classification of coey and sanvito @xcite ) , which resembles the electronic structure of magnetite .",
    "the system under investigation is schematically represented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of two semi - infinite current / voltage probes formed from mono - atomic chains and sandwiching a scattering region ( the molecule ) .",
    "electron - phonon interaction is present only in the scattering region while the leads act as an ideal phonon sink .",
    "-vector @xmath6 approaching the scattering region from the left is transmitted to the right with @xmath6-vector @xmath7 . in this 1d case if @xmath8 the energy is not conserved . ]",
    "the scattering region is composed by one or more atoms connected to the leads both via electron and phonon - assisted hopping .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 describing such a system can be divided in five parts @xmath10 @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) describes the left - hand side ( right - hand side ) lead , @xmath13 describes the molecule and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) the interaction between the left ( right ) lead and the molecule . for the leads we consider a tight - binding model expanded over a @xmath16-like orthogonal basis set @xmath17 , where @xmath18 labels the atomic position .",
    "although there is no conceptual complication in considering a multi - orbital tight - binding model here we use only one orbital per atomic site in order to keep the computational overheads to a minimum .",
    "this choice is motivated by the severe scaling of our computational method @xcite with the number of phonons .",
    "thus @xmath11 and @xmath12 read @xmath19 in the expressions above @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the annihilation and creation operators for electrons at the site @xmath18 , @xmath22 ( @xmath23= r , l ) is the hopping parameter in the leads and @xmath24 is the lead on - site energy .",
    "this already include the rigid shift given by an external voltage @xmath3 applied to the system , that is @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the on - site energy for @xmath28 .",
    "note that we implicitly assume that the leads are good metals presenting local charge neutrality @xcite .",
    "the leads extend from @xmath29 to @xmath30 to the left and from @xmath31 to @xmath32 to the right , with the molecule comprising @xmath33 sites ( @xmath34 ) .    in our model system",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is present only in the molecule and at the interface of this with the leads .",
    "we use for the description of such a scattering region the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian @xcite in its second quantization form , considering only longitudinal phonon modes @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath13 reads @xmath35 such a ssh - like hamiltonian describes linear electron - phonon coupling .",
    "it has a purely electronic part written in a tight - binding form with annihilation and creation operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 , hopping parameter @xmath38 and on - site energy @xmath39 .",
    "these tight - binding parameters refer to the static system ( without phonons ) .",
    "in addition there is an electron - phonon interaction part @xmath40 , which describes phonon absorption / emission .",
    "this is linear in the phonon annihilation and creation operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 with the coupling strength given by @xmath43 .",
    "finally it comprises the purely phononic energy @xmath44 with @xmath45 the phonon frequency for the @xmath6-mode .",
    "the frequencies @xmath45 are calculated using a classical `` springs and balls '' model for the scattering region @xcite , i.e. by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix obtained with the appropriate boundary conditions ( see figure [ mapping3 ] ) .",
    "are the masses of the atoms in the scattering region and @xmath46 are the spring constants . ]",
    "the parameter @xmath43 depends on both the energy of the @xmath6-mode , @xmath47 , and the vibrational properties of the atomic sites @xmath18 and @xmath48 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the displacement vector of the @xmath18-th atom associated to the @xmath6-mode , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the mass of the @xmath18-th ( @xmath48-th ) atom and @xmath53 is the coefficient of the linear expansion of the hopping parameter over the atomic displacement @xmath54 in the previous equation @xmath38 is the first term of the expansion and stands for the hopping parameter of the static system at the equilibrium distance , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the displacements from the equilibrium positions of the atoms @xmath18 and @xmath48 due to the lattice vibrations .",
    "the hamiltonian coupling the molecule to the leads is again of a ssh form @xmath57(c_0^{\\dag}b_1 + b_1^{\\dag}c_0)\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an analogous expression for @xmath15 .",
    "the purely elastic part is described by the hopping parameter @xmath58 while the inelastic part is characterized by the electron phonon coupling @xmath59 @xmath60 the equation ( [ gammahop2 ] ) is obtained from the ( [ gammahop ] ) by imposing static boundary conditions to the leads ( @xmath61 for @xmath18 belonging to the leads ) .",
    "we tackle the problem of transport in presence of electron - phonon interaction by using the method proposed first by bon@xmath62a and trugman @xcite .",
    "this approach consists in mapping a general many - body transport problem onto a fictitious one - body problem , where only elastic scattering is present .",
    "the method , in contrast to other perturbative approaches @xcite , is in principle exact .",
    "i.e. it does not introduce any approximation in calculating the inelastic contributions to the current .",
    "the drawback is cast in the dimension of the hilbert space needed for defining the fictitious one - body system , which grows rapidly with the number of phonon states considered . in this section",
    "we will restrain our attention to mono - atomic single - channel leads , but the same procedure can be easily extended to the multichannel case @xcite    the main idea behind this approach is that the energy is globally conserved during the scattering process .",
    "in fact , although an electron leaving the left - hand side lead with energy @xmath63 and emitting a phonon is absorbed by the right - hand side lead with a different energy @xmath64 , the energy of the system electron plus phonon is conserved ( @xmath65 is the phonon energy ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility of constructing an associated multi - channel scattering problem @xcite , using asymptotic states that include both electronic and phononic degrees of freedom , all having the same total energy . in this way",
    "the scattering problem is formally elastic and can be solved by standard scattering theory @xcite . however , when extracting the electron current , one should be able to map this fictitious problem back to the original many - body one .",
    "we then define states @xmath66 where the electronic part @xmath67 describes an asymptotic bloch state @xmath6 in the leads , and the phononic part @xmath68 is a fock state associated to the various phonon modes @xmath23 , @xmath69 , ... of the molecule . here",
    "@xmath70 is the occupation number of the mode @xmath23 . during a generic scattering event the total energy of such state @xmath71",
    "is conserved , despite the fact that the electronic energy @xmath72 may not be . therefore the scattering between the asymptotic states @xmath66 of this fictitious system is formally elastic .     to @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast in our fictitious system the scattering between states with different electronic energy ( @xmath73 ) is elastic , since the total energy ( electron plus phonon ) is conserved .",
    "( b ) a mono - atomic chain sandwiching a molecule with vibrational degrees of freedom is mapped onto an equivalent system of disconnected atomic chains coupled through a scattering region . ]",
    "note however that the bloch states @xmath67 associated to the different asymptotic states @xmath66 in general have different energies , and must be calculated from the electronic secular equation at the energy @xmath74 . importantly if the scattering is between states having identical phononic parts , then it is elastic not only for the fictitious system , but also for the actual many - body problem .",
    "therefore the mapping @xmath75 transforms an inelastic problem onto a fictitious multi - channel elastic one ( see figure [ mapping4 ] ) .",
    "for example within this approach a linear atomic chain sandwiching a vibrating molecule is formally equivalent to a collection of linear chains sandwiching an elastic scatterer , where the coupling between the chains is provided by the electron - phonon interaction only ( see figure [ mapping4 ] ) .    one can now construct a scattering theory for the asymptotic states @xmath66 by using one of the several methods available for elastic transport @xcite . in this case",
    "however there are two additional features .",
    "first a new expression for the current , including pauli exclusion principle , should be derived .",
    "in fact different incoming asymptotic states corresponding to electronic states with different energy may compete for the same final bloch state .",
    "secondly the dimension of the hilbert space is in principle infinite , since the occupation numbers entering the states @xmath66 are unbound . in practice",
    "however only a finite number of phonon modes is usually sufficient to obtain converged results , that is when the scattering transmission coefficients do not vary with the number of phonon states .",
    "most importantly the convergence can be carefully monitored by progressively enlarging the hilbert space .      in the fictitious system , where the asymptotic states are @xmath66 ,",
    "the scattering is formally only elastic .",
    "therefore we can calculate the quantum mechanical scattering probabilities by using standard scattering theory . in this work",
    "we have used the green s function approach introduced by sanvito et al . @xcite .",
    "the method consists in evaluating the total retarded green s function for the entire system ( leads plus scattering region ) , from which extracting the scattering matrix .",
    "here we briefly summarize the method and highlight the main modifications needed when dealing with the fictitious system , instead of a purely electronic one .",
    "furthermore we consider simple one - dimensional leads , supporting only one scattering channel at a given energy .",
    "the starting point consists in writing the surface green s function for the leads .",
    "these are in the form of a block diagonal matrix , which , in the case of the left - hand side lead , reads @xmath76 an analogous expression is valid for the right - hand side lead surface green s function @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is the left surface green s function of the purely electronic system ( no phonons ) at the energy @xmath64 . in general",
    "it is a @xmath79 matrix , with @xmath33 the number of degrees of freedom ( orbitals ) describing the leads surface , but in this simple case it is only a c - number @xmath80 with @xmath6 the adimensional @xmath6-vector solution of the secular equation for the simple chain @xmath81 @xmath82 is a collective index , which label the phononic state @xmath83 and the energy @xmath64 is the electronic energy of the state @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath84 . note that the block diagonal form of @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the result of the fact that different phonon states @xmath87 do not mix in the leads .",
    "note also that the green s functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 are in principle infinite matrices since the number of possible phonon states is infinite . in practice states with very large occupation numbers",
    "are not accessible and a cutoff @xmath88 over the number of phonon states is used .",
    "in contrast to what happens in the leads , different phononic states do interact inside the scattering region .",
    "the matrix representing such an interaction is a @xmath89 hermitian matrix , where @xmath90 is the number of electronic degrees of freedom ( orbitals ) describing the molecule .",
    "however , it is important to note that in this simple scattering approach , where no self - consistent evaluation of the scattering potential is carried out , it is possible to eliminate the explicit dependence of the scattering region hamiltonian over the internal electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is done by using the recursive decimation method @xcite , to yield an effective energy - dependent @xmath91 hamiltonian @xmath92 , coupling all the phononic states in the left - hand side lead with those of the right - hand side lead @xmath93 the blocks @xmath94 and @xmath95 describe the interaction respectively within the last plane of the left - hand side and first plane of the right - hand side lead , while the off diagonal blocks describe the coupling between these planes .",
    "finally the total green s function of the system leads plus molecule calculated at the two extremal planes of the leads ( @xmath18=0 and @xmath18=@xmath33 + 1 ) can be obtained by simply solving dyson s equation @xmath96^{-1}= \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } g_\\mathrm{l } & g_\\mathrm{lr } \\\\",
    "g_\\mathrm{rl } & g_\\mathrm{r}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is written as @xmath98 the total green s function @xmath99 contains all the information about the scattering amplitudes .",
    "these can be explicitly extracted by using the fisher and lee relation @xcite or in more general terms by projecting @xmath99 over a general scattering wave - function @xcite . for our single - mode",
    "leads these simply read    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the group velocity associated to the electronic component of the state @xmath105",
    "@xmath106    @xmath107 and @xmath108 are respectively the transmission and reflection amplitude for states incoming from the left - hand side lead , while @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the same quantities but for states incoming from the right - hand side lead .",
    "finally the current can be extracted from the landauer formula @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the fermi distributions respectively for left- and right - hand side lead .",
    "note that in the case of time - reversal symmetry @xmath114 and the current becomes @xmath115de\\;. \\label{curnopauli2}\\ ] ]      for elastic transport different scattering channels do not compete for the same final state , since the scattering wave - functions extend from one lead to the other .",
    "this is also formally true for our fictitious system .",
    "however when one considers the electronic part of the fictitious system , the situation appears rather different .",
    "consider for example the scattering process in which @xmath66 is transmitted into the same state @xmath66 , and the one in which it is the state @xmath116 to be transmitted into @xmath66 .",
    "in the first process the phononic configurations of the initial and final states are identical and therefore the scattering is elastic . in contrast",
    "the second process involves a change in phononic configuration , which means that energy has been exchanged between the electronic and the phononic sub - systems .",
    "this is an inelastic scattering event .",
    "the crucial point is that these two processes lead to the same final electronic state @xmath67 , the first through elastic and the second through inelastic scattering .",
    "these two scattering events do not share the same scattering wave - function and therefore compete for the same electronic states .",
    "therefore in this case the pauli exclusion principle should be taken explicitly into consideration when evaluating the current .",
    "we then use the procedure introduced by emberly and kirczenow @xcite , which evaluates self - consistently the non - equilibrium electron distributions resulting from the pauli principle .",
    "we define @xmath117 as the electronic distribution of the right - hand side lead resulting from electrons transmitted elastically from left to right at an energy @xmath64 . as a matter of notation we label with `` @xmath118 '' ( `` @xmath119 '' ) scattering processes involving electron transmission ( reflection ) , `` r ''",
    "( `` l '' ) indicates that the distribution is for the right - hand side ( left - hand side ) lead , and _",
    "`` el '' _ that the scattering process is elastic . finally the indexes @xmath23 label the associated states @xmath120 describing the process .    , contributing to the distribution @xmath121 .",
    "( b ) inelastic scattering of the state @xmath122 into the state @xmath123 contributing to the distribution @xmath124 . ]",
    "similarly @xmath124 is the electronic distributions in the right - hand side lead given by electrons incoming from the left - hand side lead and inelastically transmitted through the molecule ( fig [ mapping1 ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath64 is the energy of the final electronic state and the scattering is between the states @xmath120 and @xmath125 .",
    "if one neglects pauli s principle these quantities are simply related to the fermi distributions of the lead containing the incoming electrons @xmath126 @xmath127 where we have introduced the transmission coefficients @xmath128 , which depend on both the initial @xmath63 and final @xmath64 electronic energy .",
    "all the other distributions , for electrons approaching from the right - hand side lead , can be written in a completely analogous way @xcite .",
    "we now need to establish a procedure for evaluating the distributions @xmath129 in such a way of accounting for pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this is easily done by imposing that a generic distribution @xmath129 is given by the combined probability of transmitting an electron with that of finding the final state empty .",
    "for instance the distribution of elastically transmitted electrons in the right - hand side lead reads @xmath130\\;. \\label{form1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that the distribution in the right - hand side lead of electrons elastically transmitted at an energy @xmath64 is proportional to the probability of transmitting an initially filled state in the left - hand side lead @xmath131 , and to the probability that the final state is not already occupied @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "this last probability is determined by two competing effects : inelastic transmission from the left - hand side lead @xmath133 , and inelastic reflection from the right - hand side lead @xmath134 .",

    "analogous expression for the left - hand side lead can be obtained by replacing @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 in the equations ( [ form1 ] ) through ( [ form4 ] ) .",
    "the normalization functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 are obtained by imposing charge conservation deep into the leads , which means that the sum of all the distributions @xmath129 must be equal to the equilibrium fermi distribution of the particular lead @xmath147 @xmath148 the equations ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) together with those for the distributions ( [ form1 ] ) , ( [ form2 ] ) , ( [ form3 ] ) and ( [ form4 ] ) form a close set of equations , that can be solved for the @xmath129 iteratively .",
    "these are evaluated numerically over a discrete energy mesh .",

    "we are now in the position of investigating inelastic transport in atomic scaled systems . in particular we will consider three material systems .",
    "the first is a simple diatomic molecule .",

    "a schematic diagram of the energy level alignment is presented in figure [ alli ] .",
    "the main goal of this section is to discuss how the energy mesh and the number of phonon states included in the calculation affect the results .    .",
    "]    the general strategy for testing the convergence of the calculation is as follows .",
    "first one investigate how the transmission coefficient changes with the number of phonon states @xmath88 included in the calculation .",
    "this is done with a reasonably fine energy mesh in order to have a good energy resolution .",
    "then , once @xmath88 is fixed , the energy meshed is varied and the convergence of the current is controlled .",
    "note that the energy mesh and the cutoff over the number of phonon states have two deeply different physical meanings .",
    "the energy mesh merely controls how accurate is the energy resolution , and typically a resolution of the order of 1  mev is sufficient .",
    "in contrast the number of phonon states essentially establishes the degree of accuracy in describing multiple phonon scattering .    in figure [ displ0tt ]",
    "we show the total transmission coefficient ( elastic plus inelastic ) at zero bias as a function of energy for different numbers of phonon states @xmath161 included in the calculation .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath88 increases the transmission coefficient becomes more broadly distributed in energy and the resonances are largely smeared out .",
    "when no phonons are present @xmath162 has only two sharp resonances , located at the bonding and anti - bonding energies of the molecule , with a broadening proportional to the electronic coupling with the leads .",
    "the inclusion of phonon absorption / emission opens new scattering channel where phonon - assisted hopping to the molecular level becomes possible .",
    "this broadens the spectral range of @xmath162 and shifts the transmission peaks .",
    "in particular the resonance at the bonding state shifts almost rigidly of about 0.15  ev towards lower energies , while that at the antibonding level gets substantially smeared .",
    "this behavior is somehow expected since in our working conditions of low temperature electrons can not be transmitted with a net energy gain ( no net phonon absorption is allowed ) .",
    "thus most of the spectral modifications due to electron - phonon scattering occur above the fermi level .",
    "if we now focus our attention on the transmission coefficient for @xmath88=24 ( the higher occupation allowed is @xmath70=5 for both the phonon modes ) we can associate the first peak at about -10.25  ev with resonant elastic transport through the bonding state , the second just below -10.0  ev with phonon - assisted resonant transport through the bonding state via the first phonon mode ( @xmath159=0.24  ev ) , the third at about -9.92  ev with phonon - assisted resonant transport through the bonding state via the second phonon mode ( @xmath160=0.33  ev ) , and so on .",
    "note that peaks in the transmission coefficient appearing at rather high energies are the result of resonant transport through either the bonding or the antibonding level via multiple phonon emission .",
    "note also that upon increasing the number of phonon states @xmath162 is only weakly affected for low energies , but changes drastically at high energies .",
    "this is because new scattering paths involving multiple phonon emission become available .",
    "however these high order multiple scattering events are increasingly improbable and one expects @xmath162 to saturate for @xmath88 large enough . as a measure of the convergence of @xmath163 with the number of phonon modes we evaluate the mean deviation @xmath164 between the transmission coefficients @xmath165 and @xmath166 calculated respectively for @xmath88=@xmath167 and @xmath88=@xmath168 @xmath169 with the sum running over the energy mesh points .",
    "the values of @xmath164 for the transmission coefficients of figure [ displ0tt ] are respectively @xmath170=0.0242 , @xmath171=0.0121 , @xmath172=0.0065 , @xmath173=0.0030 and @xmath174=0.0012 .",
    "a value of @xmath175 is usually considered as a good level of convergence .",
    "the convergence of the transmission coefficients clearly guarantees the convergence of all the quantities related to them .",
    "therefore after having determined @xmath88 we can then calculate the current using equation ( [ currentf ] ) . in figure [ current_ela ]",
    "we show the elastic and inelastic contributions to the @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristic and the total current ( elastic plus inelastic ) as a function of @xmath88 for different biases .",
    "a simple rule of thumbs for understanding the features of the @xmath2-@xmath3 curve is that most of the current originates from the total transmission coefficient in an energy window comprised between @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "note that this is only approximately valid when electron - phonon scattering is present .",
    "in fact the self - consistent electron distributions @xmath129 can provide some non - vanishing contributions to the current coming from transmission coefficients outside this energy window .",
    "first consider the case in which @xmath88=0 , i.e. the purely elastic case .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 has only the elastic component and shows three different slopes , corresponding to three different resistances .",
    "for bias below 0.2  volt the transmission is small , since no molecular state is comprised in the bias window . then for voltages between 0.2 and 0.4  volt ,",
    "both the bonding and the antibonding states of the molecule appear in the bias window , producing a large increase of the current . finally for higher biases the current saturates since no new molecular states are available for transport .",
    "the main effects of switching on the electron - phonon interaction @xmath178 is that the inelastic current starts to participate to the conductance .",
    "this is almost zero for biases up to about 0.2  volt , which is roughly the energy of the first phonon mode , and then increase almost linearly with bias .",
    "this opening of phonon - assisted transport channels appears in the @xmath2-@xmath3 curve as a peak in the derivative of the differential conductance , a property which is used for detecting molecular vibrations from transport measurements @xcite . note that phonon emission for biases smaller than the energy of the first phonon mode is certainly possible",
    "however this process contributes little to the current , since the final state has high probability to be filled .",
    "note also that the elastic current for small biases increases with respect to the purely elastic case .",
    "this is due to the contribution of multiple scattering , which effectively increases the value of the transmission coefficient around @xmath153 ( see figure [ displ0tt ] ) .",
    "the relative portions of elastic and inelastic current depend on the details of the hamiltonian , however our analysis demonstrate that a considerable number of phonon states must be included in the calculations for saturating the current .",
    "figure [ displ0tc ] shows the same currents of figure [ current_ela ] , this time obtained without imposing the pauli exclusion principle through the distributions @xmath129 .",
    "the most evident difference is that now the inelastic current does not vanish for @xmath179  volt , i.e. for biases smaller than the energy of the first phonon mode .",
    "this happens since the occupation of the final state is not considered , thus transmission to final energies below @xmath177 ( the chemical potential of the right - hand side lead ) is possible . as a consequence the elastic current in the same bias region",
    "is reduced with respect to the previous case .",
    "finally note that the currents calculated either imposing or not imposing the pauli principle are similar for large biases , where the vast majority of the incoming states is filled , and the final states are empty .",
    "platinum point contacts sandwiching h@xmath0 molecules represent the ideal system , where to investigate the effects of electron - phonon interaction on the electron transport .",
    "these contacts in fact are stable for long times , enabling the measurement of low bias @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristics under different stretching conditions @xcite .",
    "the most important aspect of the current / voltage curves is a rather sharp drop of the differential conductance @xmath180 from a value of approximately @xmath181 for voltages close to 63  mvolt .",
    "this corresponds to a peak in the derivative of @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and it is attributed to the onset of electron - phonon scattering to the lowest phonon mode available in the junction @xcite .    despite the initial controversy @xcite recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite have convincingly proved that the transport in this system occurs through the antibonding state of the h@xmath0 molecule in the so called `` bridge '' configuration , i.e. with the molecular bond lying parallel to the transport direction .",
    "the antibonding state provides a high transmission channel and the differential conductance is about 0.9  @xmath184 .",
    "moreover _ ab initio _ calculations have also suggested that a transversal vibrational mode of the h@xmath0 molecule is responsible for the differential conductance drop at @xmath18560  mev @xcite .",
    "this last identification , although supported by the blue - shift of the differential conductance drop upon stretching , however is more difficult to establish since the local arrangement of the pt atoms at the tip is unknown ( it is likely that the h@xmath0 molecule bridges the pt contacts in a zig - zag geometry @xcite ) .    in an attempt of understanding the main mechanism responsible for the drop of @xmath186 and to provide a further test to our scheme , we model a pt - h@xmath0-pt point contact as two semi - infinite monoatomic current / voltage leads sandwiching a h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the leads are at half - filling with on - site energy @xmath187=0  ev and hopping parameter @xmath188=5.0  ev .",
    "this guarantees a rather large ( 20  ev ) bandwidth .",
    "the tight - binding parameters for the h@xmath0 molecule are chosen in such a way of aligning the antibonding state at the fermi level and to give a conductance close to 0.97  @xmath184 for zero bias @xcite .",
    "we consider as relevant phonon modes only longitudinal modes and we tune the electron - phonon coupling in such a way of reproducing the experimental drop of the differential conductance .",
    "note that at this level of approximation the choice of using either transverse or longitudinal modes is somehow immaterial .    ]",
    "figure [ h2 g ] summarizes the main result of our calculations . clearly , when both electron - phonon interaction and pauli principle are considered the differential conductance has a drop for voltages around 60  mv , which corresponds to the energy of the first longitudinal phonon mode at 63  mev ( oscillation of the center of mass of h@xmath0 ) .",
    "this drop of @xmath182 is due to the enhancement of inelastic back - scattering , which reduces the transmission of the elastic channel resonant at the antibonding state and it has the net effect of suppressing the current .",
    "in fact a careful analysis of the electron distributions @xmath129 has revealed a peak in @xmath189 for energies corresponding to the emission of the first longitudinal phonon .",
    "this emission , leading to the enhanced inelastic back - scattering is pauli suppressed for biases @xmath3 such that @xmath190 , but it becomes possible as soon as the bias window is large enough to allow the phonon emission .",
    "furthermore , within our simplified model we do not expect any additional differential conductance drop for small bias , since the next longitudinal phonon mode has a rather high energy ( @xmath185430  mev ) .",
    "note that such a drop of @xmath182 for @xmath191 can not be described unless both electron - phonon coupling and pauli principle are considered . on the one hand ,",
    "when the pauli principle is neglected the inelastic back - scattering is always present and contribute to the current , with the net result that no conductance drop is found . in this case",
    "the conductance has a value similar to that obtained for @xmath192  63  mv .",
    "on the other hand , if electron - phonon interaction is set to zero , no drop can be found since inelastic back - scattering is not included .",
    "the conductance now is similar to that calculated for @xmath193  63  mv and almost independent from the bias .",
    "importantly the magnitude of the differential conductance drop depends on the strength of the electron - phonon coupling , and it grows as the coupling is enhanced .",
    "such a behavior is demonstrated in the inset of figure where @xmath194/g_\\mathrm{r}(0)$ ] is plotted as a function of the coupling @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly we found that @xmath195 .",
    "since the relevant longitudinal phonon mode is that of the center of mass of h@xmath0 oscillating between the two pt contacts , the only @xmath23 determining the transport is that of the pt - h bond .",
    "this is mainly an ss@xmath196 bond @xcite , which roughly scales as @xmath197 with the separation @xmath198 between pt and h @xcite .",
    "such a scaling leads to @xmath199 , and therefore we predict for longitudinal modes a very drastic dependence of the differential conductance drop as a function of the point contacts separation .",
    "finally we investigate the effects of inelastic electron - phonon scattering on the transport properties and the gmr of a model spin - valve formed by half - metal current / voltage probes sandwiching an organic molecule .",
    "in particular we consider a @xmath200 half - metal @xcite , in which the fermi level cuts through the minority band ( see figure [ sysmagn ] ) . in our model calculation",
    "this is obtained by a linear chain of hydrogenic atoms whose on - site energies are spin - split .",
    "in particular we consider @xmath201 ev for the majority ( @xmath202 ) and @xmath203 ev for the minority ( @xmath204 ) spin bands .",
    "for both the spin - bands the hopping parameters are @xmath205 ev , which give a bandwidth and an exchange of 8  ev . with this choice of parameters the majority",
    "upper band - edge coincide with the lower minority band - edge at @xmath63=-10  ev .",
    "the molecules are linear chains of various lengths ( from one to three atoms ) made by atoms of mass 13  a.m.u .",
    "( c - h groups ) and characterized by the hopping integral @xmath206  ev .",
    "the on - site energy of the molecule is always close to the position of the fermi level giving resonant transport through the molecular states .",
    "we have then investigated two possible situations . in the first one ( see figure [ sysmagn]a ) @xmath207  ev and the fermi level @xmath208  ev is well within the minority band . in the second one",
    "@xmath209  ev is close to the lower minority band edge ( figure [ sysmagn]b ) .",
    "the hopping parameters between the molecule and the leads and the electron - phonon couplings are the same as reference @xcite , i.e. @xmath155=0.15  ev , @xmath210  ev /  , @xmath211  ev / @xmath157   and @xmath158  ev / @xmath157 .",
    "this leads to phonon modes with the following energies : i ) one atom chain , @xmath159=0.34  ev ; ii ) two - atom chain @xmath159=0.24  ev , @xmath160=0.33  ev ; iii ) three - atom chain @xmath159=0.17  ev , @xmath160=0.30  ev and @xmath212=0.34  ev .",
    "in investigating the spin - transport we consider the two spin fluids approximation where spin - flip scattering is neglected and the two spin sub - bands conduct in parallel .",
    "this is a good approximation for c - based organic molecules since both spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions are weak .",
    "the gmr is then defined as usual as @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the current of the spin - valve when the magnetization vectors of the two leads are parallel to each other and @xmath215 that for the antiparallel alignment . within the two spin fluid model these read @xmath216 and @xmath217 , with @xmath218 the spin current and the index @xmath23 ( @xmath69 ) indicating the spin direction in the left - hand side ( right - hand side )",
    "thus for instance @xmath219 is the spin current for the antiparallel configuration where electrons propagate in the majority band in the left - hand side lead and in the minority in the right - hand side lead .",
    "let us consider first the case when @xmath207  ev and @xmath208  ev .",
    "in this situation the current is not negligible only for the minority spins in the parallel configuration @xmath220 at least for biases lower than 3.6  volt , after which also @xmath219 gives contributions .",
    "in fact the particular density of states of our model half - metal and the relatively large fermi level , result in the fact that for all the other configurations the density of states ( dos ) of one of the two leads vanishes within the relevant bias window . the current is therefore completely suppressed by the lack of available states in the leads , and the gmr is always 1 . note that in principle multiple phonon emission might result in finite current also for other configurations , however this is always entirely suppressed by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the calculated @xmath2-@xmath3 for the parallel case ( up to 1 volt ) is presented in figure [ magnres82 ] for the three atomic chains investigated .",
    "the most notable feature is the drastic suppression of the elastic current as the chain length increases , and the fact that the inelastic component is only weakly affected .",
    "this is somehow expected since as the molecules becomes longer the direct tunneling probability decays and the current is dominated by the inelastic component .",
    "interestingly , for this choice of parameters , reproducing ( ch)@xmath4 molecules , the inelastic current dominates already for rather short lengths ( @xmath168=3 ) .",
    "the second case , when @xmath209  ev is somehow different , since the fermi level cuts much closer to the minority lower band - edge .",
    "in this situation the half - metal dos suppresses the current only at low bias and one expects transport in the antiparallel configuration , due to the @xmath219 channel for biases as small as 0.6  ev .",
    "in fact at such biases finite dos appears in the bias window for both the leads .",
    "this does not happen for the @xmath221 and @xmath222 contributions , which vanish at all biases .",
    "therefore one has @xmath223 and @xmath224 and the gmr is in general dependent on the bias .",
    "figure [ magnres95 ] shows the @xmath2-@xmath3 curves for both the parallel and antiparallel configurations of the spin - valve and the corresponding gmr , for molecules made respectively from one , two and three atoms .",
    "let us consider first @xmath223 .",
    "the elastic component of the current dominates for voltages up to approximately 1.5  volt , after which it gets completely suppressed .",
    "this suppression originates from the fact that the `` effective '' bias window ( where both the leads have finite dos ) remains constant for @xmath225  volt , but it moves increasingly far from the energy levels of the molecular states .",
    "this drastically reduces the elastic transmission coefficient with a strong decrease of the current .",
    "the same effects somehow occurs for the inelastic component of the current although phonon emission allows transmission over a much wider energy window .",
    "this makes the inelastic component dominating for @xmath226  volt , regardless of the chain length .",
    "in contrast in the antiparallel configuration no current can flow until the bias is large enough that the dos of the two leads overlap for some energies .",
    "this happens for @xmath2270.5  volt for the elastic component and @xmath2271.0  volt for the inelastic one . in this case",
    "we do not expect a decrease in the current for increasing bias , since the bias window is not cut by any band edge .",
    "as in the previous case the inelastic component becomes progressively more dominant as the chains gets longer and it is expected to dominate completely for very long chains .",
    "the resulting gmr is strongly bias dependent .",
    "in particular , for the present choice of parameters , it changes sign from positive at small bias to negative a high bias .        as a comparison in figure ( [ magnresel ] ) we present results for the same systems obtained without electron - phonon interaction . in this case",
    "there is no sustantial reduction of the elastic current as the molecular chain becomes longer , and the transport is always resonant through the molecular levels .",
    "however in absence of the inelastic component , the total current for the parallel alignment sharply decays for biases in excess of 1  volt . as a consequence the gmr sharply changes from 1 to -1 as the bias increases .",
    "generally , inelastic scattering increases the spectral range ( the energy region where the total transmission coefficient does not vanish ) contributing to the current ( see figure [ displ0tt ] ) . in this case of half - metallic leads",
    ", the effect is to change the gmr as a function of bias .",
    "however if the leads are made from transition metals , then the effect of electron - phonon scattering is expected to be a change in the spin - polarization of the current @xcite .",
    "this is connected to the increase of the spectral range of the transmission coefficient .",
    "a large spectral range means that a large portion of the ferromagnetic dos contributes to the current .",
    "however in an ordinary transition metal the spin - polarization of the dos is large at around @xmath153 but decreases for both higher and lower energies . at higher energies",
    "this is due to the fact that there is little contribution from the @xmath198 electrons for both spin directions , while at lower energy a large @xmath198-dos is present for both spin directions .",
    "we therefore expect that electron - phonon interaction will produce a general suppression of the gmr .",
    "we have demonstrated the rle of inelastic electron - phonon scattering on the transport properties of different nanoscale devices .",
    "this is treated using the multi - channel scheme introduced by bon@xmath62a and trugman with the explicit inclusion of the pauli exclusion principle",
    ". such method allows us to map a scattering problem with inelastic effects , onto a fictitious problem where only elastic scattering events are present .",
    "we have then given a full description of the method , within our surface green s function formalism , and described the criterion of convergence over the number and nature of phonon modes .",
    "two specific material systems have been investigated .",
    "the first are pt point contacts sandwiching a h@xmath0 molecule . in this case",
    "the differential conductance shows a sudden drop for a bias corresponding to the energy of the first h@xmath0 longitudinal phonon mode , which we have explained as an enhancement of inelastic backscattering .",
    "note that such a drop can not be found unless the pauli principle is considered .",
    "then we have investigated two types of spin - valves , obtained by contacting with half - metals a linear chain of ch groups . in this case",
    "the gmr depends on the specific alignment of the fermi level with respect to the minority lower band - edge , and in general it is strongly bias dependent .",
    "the presence of electron - phonon scattering largely increases the current in the parallel state at high voltages and makes the change in gmr upon bias smoother with respect to the case where electron - phonons interaction is not considered ."
