    "in recent years , semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "their electronic properties can be controlled with a high accuracy by applying external gate voltages and magnetic fields .",
    "circular dots are especially interesting . at low magnetic field @xmath0 , the addition energy of a two - dimensional circular dot has been found to exhibit pronounced peaks for @xmath1 electrons  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that levels group themselves into shells , in analogy with atoms and nuclei and that closed - shell configurations are particularly stable .",
    "the behaviour of open - shell states has been found to be consistent with hund s first rule  @xcite . at non",
    " zero magnetic field , transitions between ground states involving total spins and angular momenta have been observed  @xcite .",
    "these have a profound effect on the transport properties of a quantum dot .",
    "for instance , if the total spins of two ground states with @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons differ by more than @xmath4 spin blockade of electron transport is predicted  @xcite .",
    "this has been recently observed in the conductance of quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the electronic structure of quantum dots has been studied using many different techniques  @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite , configuration interaction ( ci )  @xcite , stochastic variational method  @xcite and the pocket state method  @xcite allow to calculate ground and excited state energies and their quantum numbers with very good accuracy .",
    "also quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite have been employed : they provide accurate estimates for ground and excited states energies , although total spin symmetry is not always preserved  @xcite . by means of all these techniques ,",
    "shell structure and hund s rule have been analyzed in detail .",
    "in addition , `` magic '' values for the total angular momentum have been predicted to occur for dot states with a given total spin .",
    "they occur if electrons in a quantum dot strongly interact and arrange themselves in a rotating wigner molecule  @xcite .",
    "all the above methods are computationally very expensive and can be used for relatively low electron numbers @xmath5 : only with monte carlo methods electron numbers up to @xmath6 have been reached  @xcite at zero magnetic field .",
    "other methods are used for treating systems with larger electron numbers , like the hartree fock approach ( hf )  @xcite and density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "they generally provide less accurate estimates of the ground state energy and the resulting wave functions can have unphysically broken symmetries .",
    "the hf methods are paradigmatic , in that the variational ground state wave function is a single slater determinant which does not properly include correlations and in general is not an eigenfunction of the total spin  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with space restricted hf ( rhf ) methods , space _ unrestricted _ hf ( uhf ) methods  @xcite systematically allow for symmetry breaking allowing , as a starting point for the calculations , wave functions without rotational invariance even in the case of circularly symmetric dots .",
    "while uhf yields a lower estimate for the ground state energy , it can have severe drawbacks when considering physical properties of the ground state like the total spin .",
    "for instance , uhf calculations sometimes fails predicting hund s rule , in contradiction to experiments , and in contrast to results obtained with other methods .",
    "in addition , wave functions with broken symmetries do not allow to determine the total spin and the angular momentum .",
    "methods to restore the correct symmetries have been pioneered in the 60th of the last century  @xcite and were used in the context of quantum dots , mostly for the rotational symmetry  @xcite .",
    "restoration of the _ spin _ symmetry in quantum dots has received much less attention  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a systematic projection procedure to restore both the _ spin _ and the _ rotational _ symmetries of ground state variational wave functions obtained by uhf calculations for quantum dots with up to four electrons , including a magnetic field .",
    "it is our aim to show that , after _ all the symmetries _ are restored , the wave functions are considerably improved and show several physical features which are not reproduced by the straightforwardly applied uhf method .",
    "restoring symmetries introduces correlations , absent within the single uhf slater determinant , leading to better energy estimates .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the projection procedure by comparing our results with those of the methods mentioned above .",
    "the main findings are : ( i ) at zero magnetic field , the first hund s rule is recovered for four electrons which has been claimed earlier to be violated by uhf @xcite ; ( ii ) for nonzero magnetic field , many crossovers between ground states with different total spins and angular momenta of up to four electrons are found that are completely missed by using the hf method alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ theham ] , the uhf procedure is briefly sketched , emphasizing the role of broken symmetries . in section  [ secproj ] ,",
    "the projection techniques employed in the symmetry restoration are discussed .",
    "results for zero and non - zero magnetic field are discussed in section  [ results ] . the paper is concluded by pointing out the perspectives for obtaining results for higher numbers of electrons that are not accessible by other methods .",

    "furthermore , @xmath24 is the electron charge and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) the vacuum ( relative ) dielectric constant .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hamil ] ) commutes with the total angular momentum @xmath27 ( @xmath11 component in two dimensions ) , the @xmath11-component of the total spin @xmath28 and the total spin @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are principal and angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "further , we introduced the cyclotron frequency @xmath35 , and the effective confinement frequency @xmath36 .",
    "when including interactions , the problem is in general not solvable .",
    "here , we deal with the electron interactions by using as a starting point the hf approximation .",
    "the interacting , many  body ground state wave function is written as a single slater determinant consisting of @xmath2 orbitals of the form @xmath37 , assumed to be eigenfunctions of @xmath38 @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the spatial parts , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 the spinors corresponding to @xmath43 , respectively . denoting @xmath44 and @xmath45 the number of spin up and",
    "spin down orbitals , respectively , the slater determinant is @xmath46 eigenfunction of @xmath47 .",
    "slater determinants are not in general eigenfunctions of @xmath48 , unless @xmath49 when the hf solution has total spin quantum number @xmath50 .",
    "thus , hf solutions with @xmath51 are not consistent with the spin symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is known as _ spin contamination _",
    "@xcite : a single slater determinant is in general a superposition of many eigenfunctions with different total spins but with a given @xmath47 .    the determinant is variationally optimized in order to minimize the energy @xmath52 giving rise to the well known @xmath2 coupled integro - differential equations for the orbitals @xmath53 , @xmath54\\psi_{i}^{s_{z}}({\\bf r})&\\nonumber\\\\&-\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{s_{z}}}\\left[\\int{\\rm d}{\\bf    r}'\\psi_{j}^{s_{z } * } ( { \\bf      r}')\\psi_{i}^{s_{z}}({\\bf      r } ' ) { v}({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}')\\right]\\psi_{j}^{s_{z}}({\\bf    r})=e_{i}^{s_{z}}\\psi_{i}^{s_{z}}({\\bf r})\\ , & \\label{hfe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and the electron density is @xmath56 within a given sector with fixed @xmath47 , equation  ( [ hfe ] ) is solved self  consistently , starting from an initial guess for the orbitals . _",
    "spatially unrestricted _ initial guesses are used : orbitals are assumed such that they are not eigenfunctions of the angular momentum  @xcite ( uhf method ) . with this , solutions of the hf equations corresponding to non  rotationally invariant electron densities , are obtained . these symmetry  broken solutions enhance the number of variational degrees of freedom , thus generally leading to better energy estimates .",
    "therefore , in addition to the lack of total spin symmetry already present in rhf calculations , uhf solutions do not possess the spatial symmetry of  ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "their predictive power for total spin and angular momentum of the ground state is therefore limited . as a consequence ,",
    "the symmetries of uhf wave functions must be suitably adjusted in order to address these properties .",
    "it is important to note that for given @xmath2 and @xmath47 , many local minima of the energy surface can be found depending on the initial guess used for the uhf calculation . in general , one finds a sequence of states @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) with energies @xmath59 . for a given @xmath47",
    ", one has to perform extensive scans over the space of initial conditions in order to achieve confidence that the first state in the above sequence is the best uhf state , with the lowest attainable energy .",
    "the _ uhf ground state _ is then defined as the state with the lowest among the energies @xmath60 .",
    "this also determines the value of @xmath47 for the uhf ground state .",
    "in order to reflect the symmetries of the hamiltonian in the uhf solutions , projection operators  @xcite can be applied to the wave functions . to avoid confusion , in this section operators",
    "are denoted by a over hat .",
    "consider @xmath61 and @xmath62 which project the uhf solution onto subspaces with well - defined @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "they satisfy the commutation rules @xmath65=[\\hat{p}_{s}^{s_z},\\hat{h}]=[\\hat{p}_{l},\\hat{h}]=0 $ ] . for a given uhf solution",
    "@xmath66 we define the projected state with spin and angular momenta by @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath68 where we used the commutation rules presented above and the idempotency of projection operators .",
    "the spin projector @xmath69 can be written as  @xcite @xmath70 its action on the uhf wave function is  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath74 are the sanibel coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath75 is the sum of all of the @xmath76 distinct slater determinants obtained by interchanging in the initial determinant @xmath77 _ all _ @xmath78 spinor pairs with opposite spins .",
    "the projection operator on the total angular momentum @xmath63 is  @xcite @xmath79 acting on @xmath80 with @xmath81 results in @xmath82 , a determinant where all the orbitals are rotated by @xmath83 around the @xmath11 axis .",
    "combining  ( [ project1 ] ) and  ( [ projl ] ) we have @xmath84 the projected state  ( [ project2 ] ) is a sum of many slater determinants .",
    "this indicates that a high degree of correlation has been introduced by applying the projection technique to the uhf scheme .",
    "as is clear from ( [ project2 ] ) , spin projection implies calculations which involve many slater determinants .",
    "therefore the second form of  ( [ energyp ] ) is especially useful from the computational point of view .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure is developed in [ toy ] for @xmath85 .",
    "we have implemented numerically the evaluation of  ( [ energyp ] ) , using  ( [ project2 ] ) and standard theorems for the evaluation of the hamiltonian matrix elements  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will determine the _ projected ground state _",
    ", defined as the _ projected state with the lowest energy_. this procedure , labelled `` projected hartree fock '' ( phf ) in the following , is far from being trivial : in particular , it is _ not _ sufficient to project the uhf ground state alone to determine the phf ground state . if several uhf minima @xmath86 are almost degenerate , all the corresponding @xmath87 must be projected . for each @xmath87 , the projected energies @xmath88 attain a minimum @xmath89 for given @xmath90 .",
    "the phf ground state is thus the lowest among @xmath91 .    for a given uhf solution ( corresponding to fixed @xmath0 and @xmath92 )",
    ", the spin projection involves the evaluation of all the overlapping matrix elements @xmath93 ( see [ toy ] for details ) .",
    "this constitutes a computational overhead , especially for high particle numbers . for given @xmath92 and @xmath64 ,",
    "the number of matrix elements to be evaluated is given by @xmath94 .",
    "the worst case scenario occurs for the minimal values of @xmath92 . as an example , for even @xmath2 , the number of matrix elements is @xmath95 ( a similar formula with the same asymptotic behavior holds for odd @xmath2 ) . numerically performing the angular momentum projection requires the discretization of @xmath96 $ ] in @xmath97 points , followed by a fast fourier transform ( fft ) procedure .",
    "the lower bound for the latter is determined by the maximum angular momentum @xmath98 desired , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we point out that , once the sampling has been performed , the fft simultaneously produces all the angular momenta projections for @xmath98 .",
    "we have checked that , in order to achieve good convergence with @xmath99 ( much higher than the highest @xmath100 involved in the results discussed below ) , one needs @xmath101 .",
    "thus , for the case @xmath102 , @xmath103 , fixed @xmath64 and @xmath104 , we need to evaluate @xmath105 matrix elements .",
    "this compares favorably with respect to more refined methods : for instance , exact diagonalization for @xmath102 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , needs up to 19774 slater determinants  @xcite . also for increasing numbers of",
    "electrons phf performs well : in the case @xmath109 , @xmath103 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 ( not discussed in the present work ) , ci needs 661300 configurational states functions ( linear combination of slater determinants )  @xcite while our procedure requires 5120 matrix elements to evaluate not only @xmath111 but all @xmath104 .",
    "we expect a similar performace gain for even larger number of electrons .    in the next section",
    "we will show that the phf ground state has lower energy than uhf one .",
    "most importantly , all quantum numbers of the projected ground state can be determined , in contrast to uhf .",
    "before presenting our results , we provide some technical details of the numerical method .",

    ", the 75 lowest - lying fd states per spin direction have been assumed to represent the basis .",

    "many different uhf solutions for all possible values of @xmath47 have been determined .",

    "<S> ground state energies are obtained using the unrestricted hartree fock method for up to four interacting electrons parabolically confined in a quantum dot subject to a magnetic field . restoring spin and rotational symmetries we recover hund s first rule . with increasing magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> crossovers between ground states with different quantum numbers are found for fixed electron number that are not reproduced by the unrestricted hartree fock approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these are consistent with the ones obtained with more refined techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the presence of a spin blockade due to a spin mismatch in the ground states of three and four electrons . </S>"
