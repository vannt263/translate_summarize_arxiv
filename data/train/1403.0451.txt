    "the atomic spectroscopy and collisions using slow antiprotons ( asacusa ) experiment at the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) facility of cern has recently developed position - sensitive detectors to measure and track charged pions emerging from antiproton annihilations .",
    "these segmented plastic scintillators will be used to detect annihilations that occur inside a radiofrequency paul trap for antiprotons .",
    "they were also employed in a recent experiment which attempted to measure the annihilation cross - sections of low - energy ( 130 kev ) antiprotons on various target foils @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the design and manufacture of these detectors , and beam tests carried out using negative pion ( @xmath3 ) and antiproton beams provided by the cern proton synchrotron ( ps ) and ad facilities .",
    "depending on the atomic nucleus on which an antiproton annihilates , on average 34 charged pions emerge with a mean kinetic energy of a few hundred mev @xcite . by tracking the trajectory of at least two charged pions ,",
    "the initial vertex where the annihilation occurred can be reconstructed .",
    "this technique forms the basis of many experiments now carried out at the ad .",
    "trackers based on silicon strip detectors @xcite or scintillation fibers @xcite have been previously used to detect the formation of antihydrogen , or to count the number of antiprotons stored in traps .",
    "precision laser spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium atoms have been carried out by using acrylic cherenkov counters to detect the timing of antiproton annihilations occurring in a cryogenic helium target @xcite .",
    "recently , extruded scintillators @xcite read out by wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fibers @xcite and silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) @xcite were used as tracker detectors in long - baseline neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "they may also be used in electromagnetic calorimeters in future collider experiments @xcite .",
    "compared to conventional scintillators which are read out by photomultiplier tubes , the sipm - based design has important advantages which include low cost , compact size , and insensitivity to magnetic fields .",
    "there are , however , currently numerous disadvantages such as the comparably small active area , gain , and dynamic range of the sipms ; their high dark current and temperature sensitivity @xcite ; and the narrow range of bias voltages in which the sipms can be operated in an optimal way . in this paper",
    ", we systematically studied the response of the scintillator against individual hits of minimum - ionizing pions .",
    "it was particularly important to achieve a sufficient photoelectron yield , above the backgrounds of dark current and environmental noise .",

    "the paul trap is housed in a 1-m - diameter cryostat ( fig .",

    "the cryogenic equipment was located above the vacuum vessel .",
    "we arranged 541 scintillation bars in 11 detector modules , which together covered a solid angle of @xmath4@xmath5 steradians seen from the center of the trap .     of the annihilations with 2030 mm spatial resolution .",

    "they were optimized to detect annihilations that occur in the trap with a high efficiency ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the four remaining modules [ fig .  [ structure ] ( a ) ] had larger active areas ( @xmath13@xmath9@xmath14 m@xmath1 ) , and contained extruded scintillators with a smaller cross section of 17@xmath919 mm@xmath1 which were designed for higher spatial resolution and tracking efficiency of the pions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "each module was housed in an aluminum box with 3-mm - thick walls , with support beams which held the scintillator bars in place .",
    "black adhesive sheets were lined along the inside the boxes , and provided the light tightness .",
    "wls fibers embedded in each scintillator bar collected the scintillation light .",
    "the wavelength - shifted light was subsequently guided along the fibers , and coupled to sipms which were connected to one end of the fibers .",
    "the detection and tracking efficiencies described above are optimized values , which were estimated using a monte carlo simulation based on the geant4 package @xcite .",
    "for this , a computer model of the trap was created , including its electrodes and vacuum chamber .",
    "we allowed antiprotons to annihilate on the electrodes according to the experimental branching ratios @xcite , and tracked the secondary particles for @xmath16 ns , or until all the particles left the 4@xmath94@xmath94 m@xmath17 area around the trap .",
    "the detection of charged pions was defined as events which deposited more than @xmath18 mev of energy into the scintillators .",
    "the cast scintillators ( saint - gobain crystals bc-408 ) with a polyvinyltoluene ( pvt ) base were first milled into the desired shapes .",
    "the surfaces were then polished using a two - blade fly - cutter .",
    "this consisted of an angled forecutter with a coating of polycrystalline diamond ( pcd ) deposited on its edge , and a flat finishing cutter with a monocrystalline diamond ( dixi polytools type 20370 version c ) edge .",
    "the two blades were positioned on a 85-mm diameter mount which was rotated at 2000 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) and fed at a speed of 250 mm / min .",
    "the depth of the cut during the final pass of the tool over the scintillator was adjusted to @xmath19 @xmath20 , to attain a mirror - like surface .",
    "no additional polishing of the surfaces was carried out .",
    "a 1.2-mm - wide , 1.5-mm - deep u - shaped groove [ fig .  [ structure ] ( b ) ] was next cut along the surface of each scintillator @xcite . for this a two - flute , ball - nose slot drill made of carbide with a diamond coating applied by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) was used .",
    "the mill was rotated at 2000 rpm and fed at a speed of 160 mm / min .",
    "each pass cut the groove in increments of 200 @xmath21 m . during machining , it was essential to constantly blow dry air on the groove to avoid immediate melting of the scintillator .",
    "no other lubricants were used . after this machining , optical grease ( eljen technologies ej-550 )",
    "was applied to the groove , and the wls fiber tightly pressed into it , to ensure that no bubbles formed in the contact between the fiber and scintillator .",
    "the bars were then wrapped in specular reflector foils ( 3 m vikuti ) , which have a reflectivity of @xmath22 at visible wavelengths .      a detector module containing extruded scintillators bars manufactured by fermilab",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] ( a ) .",

    "@xcite was around @xmath2550 mm .",
    "we also tested extruded scintillators manufactured by ci - kogyo k.k , with a larger cross section of 10@xmath940 mm@xmath1 and smaller hole diameter @xmath26 mm .",
    "these prototype bars were fabricated in 2010 , by melting polystyrene ( ps ) pellets ( dow chemicals no .",
    "679 ) mixed with two kinds of fluorescent dye ( ppo and popop of respective concentrations @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , and extruding them as in ref .",
    "some 0.3-mm - thick layers of tio@xmath24 were deposited on the surfaces by co - extrusion .",
    "the ends of each bar were roughly milled ; polishing these surfaces or depositing layers of tio@xmath24 paint on them did not significantly increase the light yield .",
    "this may indicate the relatively short attenuation length of this scintillator .",
    "we attempted to increase the light yield by filling optical cement ( saint - gobain crystals bc-600 ) into the scintillator holes before inserting the wls fibers .",
    "it was difficult to obtain a homogeneous filling , especially in the case of long ( @xmath29 m ) scintilallator bars , although shaking the scintillator helped to reduce the forming of bubbles in the cement .",
    "we also attempted to coat the fibers with optical grease ( eljen technology ej-550 ) before the insertion into the hole . due to the high viscosity of the grease , it was similarly difficult to achieve a homogenous filling , although the viscosity could be reduced by heating the grease to a temperature @xmath30@xmath31c .",
    "the wls fibers ( kuraray co. , ltd .",
    "y-11(200)m ) contained round polystyrene cores of refractive index @xmath32 , which were doped with 200 parts per million ( ppm ) of k27 dye @xcite .",
    "the peak absorption and emission wavelengths were @xmath33 and @xmath34 nm . each core was surrounded by an inner cladding made of polymethylmethacrylate ( @xmath35 ) , and an outer core made of fluorinated polymer ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "these fibers of diameters @xmath37 or @xmath38 mm had numerical apertures of @xmath39 and light attenuation lengths of @xmath40 m.    it was essential to position the sipms as close as possible to the cleaved ends of the fibers and center them on the fiber axis , to attain high coupling efficiencies .",
    "for this we used plastic connectors developed by the t2k experiment @xcite .",
    "one of the fiber ends was glued to the male part of the connector using optical cement ( fig .",

    "the fiber end was then polished , using polishing paper with diamond grain sizes that were progressively reduced from @xmath41 @xmath20 to @xmath14 @xmath20 .",
    "the other end of the fiber was left unpolished .",
    "to further increase the light yield , we attempted to polish the ends of the fibers opposite the sipms , and apply aluminum reflector layers of a few micron thickness by vacuum evaporation .",
    "we could not , however , attain a high - quality reflector surface that was precisely perpendicular to the fiber axis by hand - polishing . for 1520@xmath7 of the fibers treated in this way ,",
    "a substantial amount of light leaked out of the aluminized ends when the middle sections of the fibers were illuminated .",

    "the 400-pixel type had higher photon detection efficiency ( @xmath42 versus @xmath43 ) and gain ( @xmath44 versus @xmath45 ) , due to the smaller dead area and higher capacitance of its larger pixels .",
    "these sipms are often used to read out , e.g. , tracker scintillators which detect individual hits of minimum - ionizing particles with a high sensitivity .",
    "the 1600-pixel sipms , on the other hand , had lower dark current and higher dynamic range arising from the larger number of pixels which can sustain more simultaneous photon hits .",
    "these detectors are normally used to read out scintillators in calorimetric applications .",
    "we employed the 1600-pixel sipms , since many ad experiments involve an abrupt burst of pion hits which are superimposed on a less intense background of low - rate hits .",
    "such a distribution may be caused by a pulsed beam of antiprotons arriving in the trap , followed by the slow annihilation of antiprotons spilling out of the trap .",
    "the recovery time needed for a fired pixel to recharge was around @xmath4620 ns @xcite .",

    "the analog waveform of the photomultiplier was recorded using a digital oscilloscope .    in fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( a ) , the waveform of the cherenkov signal taken as an average of 14 pulses , each containing @xmath99 antiprotons arriving in the target , is shown .",
    "the instantaneous flux of pions was so high that individual annihilations could not be resolved .",
    "the 300-ns - long gaussian - shaped signal at @xmath112 ns corresponds to the envelope of the pulsed beam of antiprotons which annihilated at the target position .",
    "the annihilations that occurred at other positions along the rfqd and analyzer can not be detected , because the resulting pion flux is too low compared to the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "we also placed a cast scintillator of size @xmath113@xmath950@xmath910 mm@xmath17 , which was read out by a wls fiber and a 1600-pixel sipm , at the same position .",
    "the cathode of the sipm was biased at @xmath114 v which corresponded to a voltage between @xmath115 and @xmath116 v around the geiger breakdown value @xmath50 .",
    "the anode was grounded using a 1-k@xmath117 resistor and 100-nf capacitor , similar to the configuration in ref .",
    "the anode signal was decoupled by a 100-nf capacitor , and the waveform recorded by a digital oscilloscope of input impedance @xmath98 @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( b ) , the signal measured at a low bias of @xmath118 v corresponding to @xmath119 v is shown .",
    "the detector operated as a conventional avalanche photodiode of low gain . as expected , a single peak of amplitude @xmath4 mv appeared at @xmath112 ns , as in the cherenkov counter case [ fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( a ) ] .    as @xmath120 neared the breakdown voltage [ fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( c ) , @xmath121 v ] , however , two secondary peaks at @xmath122 and 1800 ns appeared , while the signal amplitude increased by an order of magnitude , to @xmath123 mv .",
    "this was caused by the higher sensitivity and gain of the sipm , which now detected the weak scintillation light that arose from the annihilations in the two bending magnets located upstream of the target ( fig .",
    "[ adsetup ] ) . as we exceeded the breakdown voltage [ fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( d ) , @xmath124 v ] , many more structures appeared which corresponded to the small number of antiprotons that scraped the walls of the analyzer or the secondary electron emission monitors .",
    "the detector response against the peak at @xmath125 ns of amplitude @xmath126 mv was clearly saturated . between @xmath127 [ fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( e ) ] and 73.5 v [ fig .",
    "[ chercompare ] ( f ) ] , the signal amplitude ( @xmath128 mv ) no longer increased , presumably because the charge stored in the sipm was depleted .",
    "the waveform was also deformed by the recharging time of the bias circuit and sipm . when compared with the measurements in sect .",
    "[ t9 ] , we estimated that for a setting of @xmath129 v , which was an optimal compromise between gain and dynamic range , around @xmath19 simultaneous pion hits would saturate the sipms .    in fig.[saturation ] , the amplitudes of the two intense peaks at @xmath130 ns ( filled triangles ) and @xmath107 ns ( circles ) normalized to the antiproton beam intensity measured by the cherenkov counter are shown for various values of @xmath120 .",
    "the rapid increase at @xmath4668.8 v is due to the sipm reaching geiger breakdown . from these results",
    ", we decided to operate the scintillator in two modes , i ) : at a bias of @xmath131 v to measure the timing profile of the antiproton beam in a relatively linear way , ii ) : at @xmath129 v to detect single pion hits .",
    "in conclusion , we constructed a 541-channel , segmented scintillator for detecting and tracking charged pions emerging from antiproton annihilations . both cast and extruded scintillators of thicknesses",
    "@xmath13219 mm were used , which were read out by wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fibers and silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) .",
    "the design was optimized to attain high photoelectron yields of around @xmath133 for minimum - ionizing particles .",
    "this was sufficient to detect antiproton annihilations in a future paul trap with an estimated efficiency of @xmath12 .",
    "an important source of background was the dark current of the sipms , which reached a maximum amplitude equivalent of 34 simultaneous pixel discharges within the @xmath68-ns shaping time of the amplifier .",
    "this implied that a @xmath81-value of @xmath134 was needed to achieve a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio . in the current detector design",
    ", it may therefore be difficult to significantly reduce the thicknesses of the scintillators ( e.g. , @xmath135 mm ) and increase the spatial resolution , without sacrificing the detection efficiency .",
    "the response of the scintillator against the high - intensity flux of pions emerging from the annihilation of a pulsed beam of antiprotons was studied . at low bias voltages of the sipm below the geiger breakdown threshold ,",
    "the detector accurately measured the envelope of the pulsed antiproton beam , but the sensitivity was too low to detect individual annihilations . at higher bias voltages , the detector became sensitive to individual pion hits , but a nonlinear behavior was seen .",
    "the scintillators were recently used to detect the small number of annihilations that occurred when an antiproton beam of kinetic energy @xmath136 kev was allowed to traverse thin target foils @xcite .",
    "this technique may be used in the future to determine the total annihilation cross - sections of antiprotons on various metal targets in the low - energy region .",
