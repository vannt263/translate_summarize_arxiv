    "the kadanoff - baym equations ( kbe ) @xcite are one of the fundamental theoretical schemes of a microscopic description of quantum systems out of equilibrium.@xcite due the growing interest in time - dependent phenomena , in recent years the kbe have been the object of considerable attention in several branches of physics .",
    "notable applications of the kbe are in the areas of molecular quantum transport , high energy coupled plasmas , nuclear matter , astrophysics , to mention a few.@xcite another favorable element to the widespread use of kbe is the constantly expanding capability of today s computers , which has made the full numerical solution of the kbe possible .",
    "a main strength of the kbe is that one can , in a constructive way , build approximations of increasing complexity for the one - particle green s function , @xmath0 , the key quantity in the kbe .",
    "these approximations are obtained via many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) and are known as conserving approximations , since they guarantee the conservation of important quantities such as total energy , number of particles , linear and angular momentum .    however , the fulfillment of such conserving conditions is no guarantee of the quality of the actual results obtained within a specific mba .",
    "hence , it would be useful to have a way to assess the performance of a given conserving mba .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to evaluate the range of validity of a group of well known many - body approximations ( mba : s ) by comparing the one - particle densities with the exact results for finite strongly correlated clusters out of equilibrium . the main attractive feature of such comparisons to exact results is the possibility of scrutinizing the performance of the many - body approximations in the non - equilibrium regime .",
    "this knowledge is most valuable if one wishes to use approximate many - body schemes for systems ( typically , infinite ones , e.g. systems coupled to macroscopic leads as those we consider towards the end of the paper ) where exact solutions are not available .    describing small clusters with strong electronic correlations , and subject to time - dependent fields ,",
    "presents interest not only from a conceptual point of view ; there are very many instances where the technological relevance of cluster physics is manifestly evident.@xcite the main focus of this work is to investigate the dynamics of finite clusters . in this regard , we provide here a detailed account of a study performed very recently , @xcite producing additional results for clusters and presenting in great detail the methodology we developed .",
    "we will , however , present some results for a system contacted to macroscopic contacts to generalize some of our main findings .",
    "similar clusters to those discussed here , coupled to leads have already been considered either in the stationary limit @xcite or in the real - time domain .",
    "@xcite    as specific finite model systems , we consider open - ended linear chains @xcite with short ranged hubbard interactions .",
    "we study their dynamics through exact diagonalization methods and by propagating the kbe for different mba : s .",
    "the approximations we consider are the hartree - fock ( hfa ) , the second born ( ba ) , the gw ( gwa ) @xcite and the t - matrix ( tma).@xcite all these approximations are conserving , @xcite which clearly is of great importance when propagating the kbe , and all of them , apart from hfa , have self energies which are non - local in space and time . for the gwa , we will consider both a spin - independent and a spin - dependent version . @xcite the latter has the advantage to alleviate the effect of self - screening .",
    "@xcite    a general outcome of our study is that the tma is seen to perform better than the other mbs : s at all fillings and interaction strengths .    with the exact and kbe cluster dynamics at our disposal ,",
    "we also investigate numerically a well established relation between mbpt and another framework to treat non - equilibrium phenomena , i.e. time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) .",
    "@xcite using a spin - independent tddft description for the spin - compensated hubbard model,@xcite we will obtain the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potentials corresponding to the different mba : s via reverse engineering from the time - dependent densities .",
    "our results show that the time - dependent kbe present two interesting features .",
    "the first is that for large external fields , the kbe time evolution in clusters exhibits a damped behavior induced by many - body correlations ( hereafter , we refer to this as correlation - induced damping ) .",
    "the second feature is that the steady state one reaches is not unique but depends on how the perturbation is switched on .",
    "we also investigate clusters connected to macroscopic leads , which we in this paper we treat within the tma and ba . in this case",
    "the presence of the correlation - induced damping is in general not artificial but the steady states may be non - unique .",
    "these statements are also valid in presence of macroscopic contacts , as shown below for a small cluster coupled to leads and with a time evolution within the tma .    in finite clusters",
    "the correlation - induced damping and the existence of multiple steady states is artificial and we show that it is due to limitations of self - consistent many - body perturbation theory when applied to finite systems .",
    "we will also provide selected numerical examples , which suggest that correlation - induced damping can be present even in the presence of leads .",
    "the question whether or not the correlation - induced damping and the existence of multiple steady states in contacted systems is a mere consequence of mbpt is at present not so straightforward to address with full generality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with a description of our model system(s ) in section [ model ] ; then , in section [ sec_green s function ] , we discuss the general properties of the single - particle green s function .",
    "section [ sec_mba ] is an overview of the many - body approximations used in this work .",
    "section [ sec_groundstate ] is devoted to the procedure to obtain the ground state within the kbe .",
    "how to solve the kbe for the time evolution is reported in section [ sec_time dependence ] . in section [ sec_tddft ]",
    "we detail how we extract the tddft exchange - correlation potentials corresponding to a chosen mba .",
    "the ground - state and time - dependent results are presented in section [ sec_results : groundstate ] and [ sec_results : time dependence ] , respectively .",
    "section [ sec_damping ] deals with the correlation - induced damping which occurs during the kbe time evolution and the existence of multiple steady states .",

    "thus , each site ( or , equivalently , each orbital ) can accommodate a maximum of two electrons , with opposite spin .",

    "there is a very important group of approximations which conserve quantities such as the total energy , the number of particles , linear and angular momentum , when the system is subject to external fields .",

    "the damping induced by correlations and the one due to the coupling to the macroscopic contacts have in general different characteristic time scales .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ vlink ] where we have gradually increased the coupling to the leads : here , the external field and the lead band width are such that the corresponding ground state of the final hamiltonian contains no poles . in the case of an isolated cluster ( @xmath228 ) ,",
    "the damping is only due to correlations .",
    "once the coupling to the leads is non - zero , there will be , in addition to the correlation - induced one , a damping due to the contacts ; the latter will eventually bring the system to the corresponding ground state . in fig .",
    "[ vlink ] , the ground - state values of the densities are represented by arrows ( on the scale of the figure , the red and green arrows are not distinguishable ) .",
    "note that each curve in fig .",
    "[ vlink ] corresponds to a different system , i.e. with a different device - lead coupling strength .",
    "each of these systems has a different final hamiltonian , i.e. a different corresponding ground state . when the coupling strength is weak ( @xmath229 ) , the time scale of the damping due to the leads is much longer than correlation - induced one . for intermediate coupling strengths ( @xmath230 ) ,",
    "the characteristic times will be of the same order of magnitude and the interplay of the two mechanisms becomes intrisically difficult to discern .",
    "when the coupling strength is strong ( @xmath231 ) , the damping is completely dominated by the leads .    as a final remark , we know that the correlation - induced damping is artificial in isolated clusters , and we saw in fig .",
    "[ vlink ] that when the coupling to the leads is weak , the initial damping is also dominated by correlations .",
    "these two facts together seem to cast some doubt on the capability of the kbe+mba : s scheme to describe ( within the simple mba : s discusses here ) transients in the weak coupling case ( a regime which is of high experimental interest , and in fact among the most investigated in the literature ) .    to summarize this section",
    ", we see that correlation - induced damping and multiple steady states are present both in isolated and contacted clusters . in the case of isolated clusters ,",
    "this damping is artificial as the exact solution does not reach a steady state .",
    "the question whether or not the correlation - induced damping and the existence of multiple steady states in a cluster coupled to leads is an artifact of many - body perturbation theory is beyond the scope of this paper and is left to future work .",
    "a main objective of this paper has been to describe in detail a method , within the framework of the time - dependent kadanoff - baym equations ( kbe ) , to study finite systems in equilibrium as well as out of equilibrium .",
    "the main emphasis of the paper has been on finite clusters , for which a meromorphic representation of the equilibrium many - body quantities is possible , but , in few instances , we have also considered some results for contacted clusters .    as a concrete application",
    ", we examined the time evolution of clusters with strong , short ranged electron interactions within several many - body approximations , and compared the results to exact ones .",
    "a first main outcome of this comparisons is that , for short ranged , hubbard - type interactions , the t - matrix approximation performs very well at low densities , and is in general superior to the gw and second born approximations , both in describing the time - dependent density and the corresponding exchange - correlation potential .",
    "a second important outcome of our work is the existence of two remarkable features of the time - dependent kbe .",
    "the first is that the kbe present a correlation - induced damping in the non - linear regime .",
    "the second is that the steady state reached is in general not unique , i.e. the stationary kbe support multiple stationary states .",
    "since a finite cluster subject to a non - adiabatic perturbation will oscillate indefinitely , it is clear that , for finite systems , such damping and multiple steady - state behavior are artificial .",
    "we argue that this shortcomings will always be present when applying infinite order perturbation theory based on partial summations to finite systems . in this paper , we were not able to provide a conclusive answer to whether such two aspects of the kbe bear any physical meaning or if they are a spurious effect of mbpt . as we discuss next ,",
    "this is part of our plans for follow - up work .",
    "future research activity may be envisaged in various directions .",
    "on the methodological side , it would be of interest to further investigate , for contacted systems , how sound the correlation - induced damping and the multiple steady states are .",
    "@xcite    a second methodological issue we are currently addressing is performance of the different mba : s in quantum transport geometries .",
    "we will will do by comparing the approximate results with those of time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group calculations.@xcite    another possible line of study would be searching for algorithms to reduce / optimize the computational costs of time - dependent kbe numerical calculations .",
    "this is necessary to deal with more realistic systems .    as a fourth direction",
    ", it would be of great interest to study the effect of including bosonic degrees of freedom as vibration phenomena often play an crucial role in quantum transport .",
    "finally , we also intend to use our kbe - based computational treatments in some specific applications : possible examples are real - time qubit manipulation , bistability induced by electron - phonon interaction , cold - atom dynamics .",
    "more specific details are deferred to future publications .",

    "the energy functionals considered here are the galitskii - migdal ( gm ) and the luttinger - ward ( lw ) .",
    "an important difference between them is that the gm needs only the knowledge of the single - particle hamiltonian and of the spectral function of @xmath0 , while the lw incorporates the @xmath59 functional as well as @xmath50 $ ] , which depends on which approximation one is using .",
