    "in recent years there has been great interest in higher dimensional black hole spacetimes .",
    "the discovery of stationary black rings in five dimensions with horizon topology @xmath3 @xcite , in particular , showed that the classification of asymptotically flat black holes will not be a simple extension of the four dimensional results .",
    "interest has also focused on black holes with kaluza - klein boundary conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ those that approach minkowski space @xmath4 times a compact ricci - flat space @xmath5 at infinity .",
    "already in the simplest case of compactification on a circle , kaluza - klein black holes display many interesting physical phenomena , such as the gregory - laflamme instability of black strings and the black hole - black string transition .",
    "for compactification on a more general ricci - flat compact space @xmath5 , one expects similar phenomena . a black hole horizon , for example ,",
    "may be localized on @xmath5 , or it may wrap some topologically non - trivial cycle of @xmath5 . the space of black hole solutions with these boundary conditions will exhibit a correspondingly rich phase structure .    in this paper we will focus on the first law of black hole mechanics for kaluza - klein black holes . for asymptotically flat black holes ,",
    "the first law @xcite relates the variation of the horizon area to the variations of quantities defined at infinity , such as the adm mass and angular momentum . for kaluza - klein black holes ,",
    "there are additional parameters that characterize the spacetime at infinity , namely the moduli of the compact manifold @xmath5 .",
    "one can now consider two nearby black hole solutions that both approach @xmath6 at infinity , but with slightly shifted values of the moduli .",
    "our particular object in this paper will be determining how such variations in the moduli enter into the first law for kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "if the compact manifold is a circle , there is a single modulus , which is simply the length @xmath7 of the circle . in this case , the first law including variations in @xmath7 has been worked out in @xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition to the length @xmath7 , spacetimes asymptotic to @xmath8 are characterized at infinity by the adm mass @xmath9 and the tension @xmath10 .",
    "the adm mass is , of course , a familiar quantitiy and is defined with respect to the asymptotic time translation killing vector .",
    "the spacetime tension @xmath11 @xcite@xcite@xcite is similarly defined with respect to the asymptotic spatial translation killing vector around the @xmath1 .",
    "the first law for black hole spacetimes is then given by @xcite @xmath12 we see that in addition to the usual @xmath13 term , there is a ` work ' term given by the product of the tension and the variation in the length of the @xmath1 at spatial infinity .",
    "a positive spacetime tension corresponds to a negative pressure .",
    "it was shown in reference @xcite that the gravitational contribution to the spacetime tension , exclusive of any matter sources which might have negative tension ( _ i.e. _ positive pressure ) , is always positive .",
    "hence the coefficient of @xmath14 has the opposite sign than is common in thermodynamics , where one generally considers positive pressures .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a new derivation of the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) for @xmath1 kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "our proof is based on hamiltonian methods that were used in reference @xcite to derive a gauss s law type relation for perturbations in general relativity , and in reference @xcite to derive the first law with asymptotically flat boundary conditions .",
    "this new proof extends the range of validity of the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) in the following way . while the derivations given in @xcite and @xcite each make certain symmetry assumptions about the allowed perturbations , the new derivation , like that of @xcite , holds for arbitrary perturbations between solutions .",
    "in particular , although equation ( [ firstlaw ] ) refers to perturbations around a static black hole , the perturbations themselves need not be static . with our analysis is is also straightforward to add perturbative sources of stress - energy , see section ( [ sources ] ) .",
    "we then go on to apply the hamiltonian formalism to derive the first law in the case that the compact space @xmath5 is a @xmath2-torus .",
    "we consider how the adm mass of a black hole varies under arbitrary deformations of the shape and size of the @xmath15 .",
    "we find that the first law , in this case , takes the form @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the volume of the torus , @xmath18 is the strain tensor corresponding to the deformation of the @xmath15 , and @xmath19 is a  tension tensor \" that generalizes the tension @xmath11 of the @xmath1 case .",
    "we expect that this result will extend to compactifications on higher dimensional tori @xmath20 as well .",
    "we begin by reviewing the formulas for the adm mass and tension in the case @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "let us write the spacetime metric near infinity as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-dimensional minkowski metric .",
    "the components of @xmath25 are assumed to fall - off sufficiently rapidly that the integral expressions for the mass and tension are well - defined ( see equation ( [ asymptotics ] ) below ) . in the asymptotic region , write the spacetime coordinates as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath28 goes around the @xmath1 and is identified with period @xmath7 .",
    "the adm mass is the gravitational charge associated with the asymptotic time translation symmetry @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a spatial slice and @xmath31 its boundary at spatial infinity , then in asymptotically cartesian coordinates , the adm mass is given by the integral @xmath32 where indices are raised and lowered with the asymptotic metric @xmath23 and the area element @xmath33 is that of a sphere @xmath34 at infinity in a slice of constant @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "the tension is the gravitational charge associated with the asymptotic spatial translation killing vector @xmath36 .",
    "the tension is similarly given by the integral @xmath37 note that in contrast with the adm mass , the definition of the tension does not include an integral in the @xmath28-direction .",
    "the adm mass is an integral over the boundary of a slice of constant @xmath35 , which includes the direction around the @xmath1 .",
    "the tension , on the other hand , is defined @xcite@xcite@xcite by an integral over the boundary of a slice of constant @xmath28 .",
    "this includes , in principle , an integration over time .",
    "however , if one expands the integrand around spatial infinity , one finds that terms that make non - zero contributions to the integral are always time independent .",
    "time dependent terms fall - off too rapidly to contribute .",
    "hence , one can omit the integration over the time direction and work with the quantity @xmath11 defined above , which is strictly speaking a ` tension per unit time ' .",
    "similar issues will arise in the definition of the tension tensor , when we consider @xmath15 compactifications .",
    "it is also useful to note , that the expression ( [ admdefn ] ) for the adm mass does not involve @xmath38 , while the expression ( [ tensiondef ] ) for the tension does not involve @xmath39 .",
    "these features follow naturally from the hamiltonian derivation of the gravitational charges ( see _ e.g. _ references @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .    making use of the linearized einstein equations in the asymptotic region ,",
    "the adm mass and tension intergrals may be evaluated @xcite in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the metric coefficients @xmath40 with the results @xmath41 we will make use of these formulas below and derive similar expressions for the mass @xmath42 and tension tensor @xmath19 for @xmath15 compactifications .",
    "before proceeding with our derivation of equation ( [ firstlaw ] ) , we examine in some greater detail how the first law operates in two simple examples , the uniform black string and the static kaluza - klein bubble .",
    "these examples help build intuition into the physical significance of the work term in the first law .",
    "the metric for the uniform black string is given by @xmath43 the coordinate @xmath28 in the @xmath1 direction may be identified with any period @xmath7 . in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the metric coefficients in ( [ asymptotics ] ) this means that we have @xmath44 , while @xmath45 . using ( [ massandtension ] )",
    ", one finds that the adm mass and tension of the black string are given by @xmath46 the tension @xmath11 is simply equal to a constant factor , @xmath47 , times the mass per unit length @xmath48 .",
    "given that the metric is flat in the @xmath28-direction and that the period @xmath7 may be set freely by hand , it seems surprising that changes @xmath14 in the period around the @xmath1 are part of a non - trivial thermodynamic relation . in particular",
    ", since the mass @xmath42 in ( [ stringmass ] ) is linear in @xmath7 , one might expect that the coefficient of @xmath14 in equation ( [ firstlaw ] ) should simply be @xmath48 .",
    "however , this intuition misses the fact that , if @xmath7 is varied with the parameter @xmath49 being held fixed , the horizon area will also change . in order to hold @xmath50 fixed ,",
    "the parameter @xmath51 must be varied in a precise way , as @xmath7 is varied .",
    "one way to see how the first law then works out is to express the mass in terms of the horizon area @xmath50 and the period @xmath7 as independent variables .",
    "the black string horizon has spatial topology @xmath52 and radius @xmath53 .",
    "the horizon area is then given by @xmath54 , while the surface gravity is simply @xmath55 .",
    "we can now solve for the parameter @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath7 and substitute into ( [ stringmass ] ) to get the expression for the mass @xmath56 in which @xmath50 and @xmath7 may be regarded as independent variables . the surface gravity is similarly given in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath7 by @xmath57 the first law ( [ firstlaw ] )",
    "can then verified by the explicit computations @xmath58 in particular we see that , with the horizon area held fixed , the work required to stretch the length of the @xmath1 by @xmath14 is indeed proportional to the tension @xmath11 .    for static , non - uniform black strings ,",
    "the adm mass will again be simply proportional to the period @xmath7 as in equation ( [ massandtension ] ) . in this case",
    ", one can not do the explicit calculations above to verify the first law .",
    "since we do not know the solution in the interior , we can not vary it in such a way that the horizon area stays fixed as we vary @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , the first law guarantees that when the horizon area of the black hole is held fixed , the change in @xmath42 under a variation in @xmath7 will be proportional to the tension @xmath11 .",
    "this comes comes about , as we will see below , because the first law follows from a relation between a boundary integral at the horizon and one at spatial infinity .",
    "this relation holds for any perturbation of a static solution to a nearby solution of the equation of motions , and does not rely on any detailed knowledge of the unperturbed solution in the interior .",
    "the static kaluza - klein bubble is given by the double analytic continuation of the uniform black string @xmath59 the asymptotic behavior of the metric functions in ( [ asymptotics ] ) is given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while the bubble mass and tension are determined according to equation ( [ massandtension ] ) to be @xmath62 in this case , the @xmath28 direction is not flat , and it is perhaps less surprising that varying the period @xmath7 should enter non - trivially into the first law .",
    "the application of the first law in the kk bubble case , however , is rather different than the uniform black string and exposes some new features .",
    "the first observation to make is that the kk bubble has no horizon .",
    "hence the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) reduces to the statement @xmath63 .",
    "this is again in seeming conflict with the fact that the expression for the adm mass is linear in the period @xmath7 , which would lead one to expect that @xmath64 should be proportional to @xmath48 , rather than the tension @xmath11 .",
    "however , there is an additional complication that must be taken into account for the kk bubble .",
    "as we will see below , the derivation of the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) assumes that the only internal boundaries on a spacelike slice are black hole horizons .",
    "if other internal boundaries were present , then the first law would acquire additional terms .",
    "for general values of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath7 , the kk bubble has a conical singularity at the bubble radius @xmath65 . in order for the metric to be smooth at @xmath66 , the period @xmath7 of the @xmath28",
    "coordinate must be fixed to be @xmath67 in order that the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) should apply as stated to the kk bubble , this condition must be preserved by any variations .",
    "hence , if the period @xmath7 is varied , the parameter @xmath49 must be varied as well .",
    "this can be done by using equation ( [ fixedl ] ) to solve for the parameter @xmath49 in terms of the period @xmath7 and substitute into ( [ bubblemass ] ) to get for @xmath42 purely in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath68 we can then vary this formula to obtain @xmath69 in agreement with the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) .",
    "had we not imposed the relation ( [ masslength ] ) , the resulting conical singularity would introduce a new contribution to the first law .",
    "this will be evident from our derivation of the first law in section ( [ theproof ] ) below .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) using the hamiltonian methods of references @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we do this in two steps . in the first step we consider only variations that preserve the length of the @xmath1 at infinity , _",
    "i.e. _ those that have @xmath70 . in this case",
    ", the previous results extend straightforwardly to the present @xmath71 boundary conditions to establish the result ( [ firstlaw ] ) with @xmath70 .",
    "we recount the main points in this derivation below , so that we may see what needs to be modified to allow for @xmath72 .",
    "the essential change that must be dealt with in this case is that the variation @xmath73 does not vanish at infinity . to focus on this new feature",
    ", we will take the background spacetime to be static rather than stationary .",
    "let @xmath74 be a static solution to the vacuum einstein equations that is asymptotic to @xmath75 at spatial infinity .",
    "we will call @xmath74 the unperturbed , or background , metric .",
    "the first law follows from considering how the gravitational hamiltonian changes under perturbations to the background metric .    for the hamiltonian decomposition",
    ", we write the full set of spacetime coordinates coordinates @xmath76 as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , with @xmath27 .",
    "we write the spacetime metric @xmath79 as @xmath80 the background metric is static with respect to the killing vector @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in appropriate coordinates the background shift vector vanishes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 . the background lapse and spatial metric are then denoted by @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "note that the gravitational momentum of the background , @xmath84 , also vanishes .",
    "now consider the metric @xmath85 , which is a perturbation of the static background metric .",
    "the perturbed metric @xmath79 is also required to solve the einstein equations , but is not required to be static .",
    "we examine how the gravitational hamiltonian varies under this perturbation .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath86\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the gravitational momentum , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are respectively the scalar curvature and covariant derivative operator for the metric @xmath90 on the spatial slice .",
    "let @xmath91 be the value of the hamiltonian evaluated on the background metric , and let @xmath92 be the first variation of the hamiltonian , again evaluated at the background metric . since the gravitational hamiltonian vanishes on vacuum solutions , and since we are perturbing between vacuum solutions , we know that both of these quantities vanish .",
    "the equation @xmath93 , we will see , then relates a boundary integral at infinity to one at the horizon .",
    "this relation yields the first law , as follows .",
    "we now compute the first order variation in the hamiltonian due to the perturbation to the background metric . since the momentum and shift vector for the background metric vanish ,",
    "the only nonvanishing contributions to @xmath92 come from varying the scalar curvature of the spatial metric @xmath88 .",
    "the first order variation of the hamiltonian about the reference metric is then given by @xmath94 where indices are raised and lowered using the background spatial metric and @xmath95 is the corresponding covariant derivative operator . as in the derivation of the hamiltonian equations of motion , integration by parts gives @xmath92 as the sum of two pieces , a volume term and a total derivative .",
    "one finds @xmath96 where the volume term is given by @xmath97 and the total derivative term is given by @xmath98 , with @xmath99 consider the volume term @xmath100 first",
    ". the steps that we have followed above are those one would follow in deriving the hamiltonian equations of motion for the background metric . in particular , the integrand of ( [ volume ] ) is equal to the lie derivative of the background momentum @xmath84 with respect to the killing vector @xmath29 . since the reference metric is static , this quantity vanishes and hence @xmath101 .",
    "the vanishing of the integrand in ( [ volume ] ) can also be checked directly using the relation @xmath102 for the killing vector @xmath103 .",
    "using gauss s law , @xmath104 can be written as a boundary term @xmath105 the boundary of the spatial slice @xmath30 has two components , an inner boundary at the black hole horizon and an outer boundary at spatial infinity , which we denote by @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively .",
    "the equation @xmath108 , which is satisfied for perturbations between solutions to the equations of motion , then reduces to the requirement that @xmath109 it is shown in reference @xcite that the boundary integral evaluated at the horizon is given by @xmath110 although reference @xcite was concerned with asymptotically flat spacetimes , this last result just depends on @xmath29 being the generator of a killing horizon .",
    "it therefore continues to hold , in particular , in the case of black holes asymptotic to @xmath71 .    using this result",
    ", we can write equation ( [ sumofboundaries ] ) as @xmath111 to evaluate the right hand side of equation ( [ almost - there ] ) note that with our boundary conditions , the components of @xmath112 all fall - off at least as fast of the @xmath1 to vary below , the component @xmath113 will also have a constant piece at infinity , which gives the change in length . ] as @xmath114 , the fall - off required for finiteness of the adm mass and tension .",
    "thus , although the volume element @xmath115 , the derivative operator @xmath116 and the lapse @xmath82 are those of the background metric @xmath117 , only the long distance , flat space limits of these quantities contribute to the integral .",
    "for example , in evaluating the integral it is accurate to make the replacement @xmath118 terms involving the derivative of lapse then , in particular , fall - off too fast to give non - zero contributions . the right hand side of ( [ almost - there ] ) then has the same form as equation ( [ admdefn ] ) for the adm mass , with @xmath119 replaced by @xmath112 , and hence gives the change @xmath64 in the adm mass under the perturbation .",
    "hence , equation ( [ almost - there ] ) becomes the first law @xmath120 for black holes asymptotic to @xmath71 with the length of the @xmath1 at infinity held fixed .",
    "we pause to point out how kaluza - klein bubbles fit into this framework .",
    "equation ( [ sumofboundaries ] ) assumes that the only internal boundary is a black hole horizon .",
    "kaluza - klein bubbles have no black hole horizons , but a generic bubble will have a conical singularity on the axis of the @xmath36 killing vector .",
    "this means that special care must be used in the hamiltonian treatment , which effectively introduces an inner boundary surrounding the conical singularity ( see reference @xcite ) .",
    "our treatment has implicitly assumed that there are no inner boundaries of this type present .",
    "we now allow the length @xmath7 of the @xmath1 to vary and examine what changes this introduces to the calculations above .",
    "we begin by recalling the formula for the adm mass @xmath121 which assumes the asymptotic forms of the metric coefficients given in ( [ asymptotics ] ) .",
    "we can vary the length of the @xmath1 at infinity , preserving these asymptotic forms , by simply changing the period of the coordinate around the @xmath1 to be @xmath122 . from equation ( [ massagain ] ) , it is clear that the change in the adm mass under this variation is then proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath123 where , in varying the expression for the mass in ( [ massagain ] ) , the quantity @xmath124 comes from variations to @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "let us now return to equation ( [ sumofboundaries ] ) , which states that the sum of the boundary terms that contribute to the variation of the hamiltonian between nearby solutions must vanish .",
    "this statement , which serves as the workhorse for proving the first law , continues to hold with @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , the boundary term at the black hole horizon continues to be given as in equation ( [ innerboundary ] ) by @xmath127 .    the boundary term at infinity , however , does change . since we are working to linear order in perturbation theory",
    ", we can write it as the sum of two pieces . on the one hand",
    ", we have a piece that is not proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "we have shown above that this piece is given by @xmath128 times the variation @xmath129 .",
    "on the other hand , we have a second piece of the boundary term at infinity that is the part proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "given this information , equation ( [ sumofboundaries ] ) can be written as @xmath130 the coefficient @xmath131 is then the quantity that we wish to determine .",
    "we can also go one step further , and substitute for the quantity @xmath124 using equation ( [ separate ] ) to get @xmath132 to calculate the contribution @xmath133 to the boundary term at infinity , one must be careful in determining the perturbation @xmath134 .",
    "the unperturbed background metric has @xmath135 and the coordinate @xmath28 around the @xmath1 identified with period @xmath7 . in the perturbed metric , the coordinate @xmath136 around the @xmath1 is identified with period @xmath122 and the corresponding metric component is given by @xmath137 in order to compute the perturbation @xmath113 , one needs to take the difference of the perturbed and the unperturbed metric expressed in the same coordinate system .",
    "the necessary coordinate transformation is given by @xmath138 so that as in the background the coordinate @xmath28 has period @xmath7 .",
    "the behavior of the metric component in the @xmath28 direction near infinity is given in equation ( [ asymptotics ] ) .",
    "transforming the metric to the new coordinate , and dropping terms beyond linear order in the perturbations , gives @xmath139 , which then lets us determine the metric perturbation to be @xmath140 note that this metric perturbation includes both a constant term at infinity , which gives directly the change in length of the @xmath1 , and a change in the coefficient of the @xmath114 term .",
    "we now evaluate the contributions proportional to @xmath14 in the boundary integral ( [ boundary ] ) evaluated at infinity . in section ( [ lzero ] )",
    ", we argued that because the metric perturbations fell off like @xmath114 , that the terms involving the derivative of the lapse would fall off too rapidly to contribute , as would terms involving the difference of the derivative operator @xmath95 from the flat derivative operator .",
    "since @xmath113 goes to a constant at infinity , this is no longer the case and one finds the following contributions @xmath141 where the behavior near infinity of the lapse function @xmath82 and the christoffel symbol @xmath142 of the reference metric are found from the asymptotic forms ( [ asymptotics ] ) .",
    "we can now plug our result for @xmath133 into equation ( [ nearlythere ] ) and find that the factors combine to give the first law @xmath143 this relation was derived in @xcite for perturbations that share the symmetries of the background metric . here",
    "we have shown that the result holds for arbitrary perturbations between solutions .",
    "further , it is also straightforward within the present formalism to add in perturbative sources of stress - energy .",
    "assume as above that @xmath117 is a static vacuum solution .",
    "also as before , we consider another metric @xmath144 that is perturbatively close to @xmath79 .",
    "however , rather than assuming that the metric @xmath79 solves the vacuum einstein equations , we now allow for perturbative source terms with stress - energy given by @xmath145 .",
    "this alters the analysis above in the following way .",
    "recall that the hamiltonian constraint with sources is given by @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the energy density .",
    "our equation ( [ sumofboundaries ] ) then becomes @xmath148 and hence the first law becomes @xmath149",
    "having established the first law for @xmath1 kaluza - klein black holes , we now show how the hamiltonian formalism can be used to derive a first law for black holes in higher dimensional torus compactifications .",
    "we consider explicitly only the @xmath2-torus .",
    "however , we expect that our results should extend to @xmath150-torus compactifications as well .",
    "the overall size and shape of a flat @xmath15 are specified by @xmath151 real moduli .",
    "we will show that the contribution of variations in these moduli to the first law may be expressed in terms of the physics of elastic media , _ i.e. _ in terms of stresses and strains . the work done in making a small deformation of an elastic medium ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) is given by the integral over the body of the contraction of the strain tensor for the deformation with the applied stress tensor .",
    "varying the moduli of the @xmath15 gives rise to a strain tensor @xmath18 , where the indices @xmath152 run over the @xmath2 coordinates on the torus .",
    "further , we will see that the role of the stress tensor is played by the tension tensor @xmath19 , defined below , which is a natural generalization of the tension @xmath11 of @xmath1 kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "both the tension and strain tensors are constant over the @xmath15 .",
    "hence integration over the torus introduces an overall factor of its volume @xmath17 , and the first law for @xmath15 kaluza - klein black holes then takes the form @xmath153 one expects that @xmath15 kaluza - klein black holes have a rich phase structure @xcite@xcite .",
    "a black hole horizon can be localized on the @xmath15 , it may wrap one or the other of the nontrivial cycles , or it may wrap around the entire @xmath15 .",
    "there should be critical behavior associated with transitions between all these different types of horizon topologies . for a fixed shape of the @xmath15 at infinity , in analogy with the work of @xcite from the @xmath1 case , it is natural to expect that a four - dimensional phase diagram including the mass @xmath42 and the 3 components of @xmath154 will be necessary to describe these transitions .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath15 case , the details of the phase diagram should additionally depend on the shape of the torus . in the @xmath1 case",
    ", there is only a single parameter needed to describe the compactification manifold , namely the length @xmath7 .",
    "this can be used to set an overall length scale for the axis of the phase diagram as in @xcite .",
    "hence , the phase diagram looks the same for any value of @xmath7 . for @xmath15 compactifications ,",
    "the overall volume @xmath17 of the torus may similarly be scaled out .",
    "however , the remaining two real shape parameters for the torus remain .",
    "we define the tension tensor @xmath19 for @xmath15 kaluza - klein compactifications in the following way .",

    "we further assume that the only nonvanishing components of the stress - energy tensor are @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . by taking various linear combinations of the einstein equations ( [ linear ] ) , one can then obtain the following relations @xmath169 we can now obtain a formula for the adm mass that is analogous to that in equation ( [ massandtension ] ) , @xmath170 we then similarly define the elements of the tension tensor @xmath19 , with @xmath171 .",
    "@xmath172 where we have omitted the integral over the torus directions as well as the integral over time ( see the discussion following equation ( [ tensiondef ] ) ) .",
    "this then defines a symmetric tensor . using equatiions ( [ tyy],[tzz],[tyz ] )",
    "the volume integrals can be converted to boundary integrals .",
    "hence the elements of the tension tensor are given explicitly in terms of the coefficients in terms of the far field behavior by @xmath173 where the coefficients are defined in ( [ t2asymptotics ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the specifics of how we parameterize the shape and size of the @xmath15 at infinity , as well as its deformations .",
    "an @xmath150-dimensional torus can , of course , be regarded as the euclidean @xmath150-plane modded out by a lattice . for the @xmath2-torus",
    ", the lattice will have @xmath2 basis vectors and we will use the components of these basis vectors to specify the size and shape of the torus ( see figure ( [ torusfig ] ) ) . the torus is then given by points in the @xmath174-plane subject to the identifications @xmath175 where @xmath176 .",
    "for a rectangular torus , in particular , @xmath177 and the parameters @xmath178 , @xmath179 are the lengths of the two sides .",
    "[ torusfig ]   is shown .",

    "the additional degree of freedom describes the orientation of the lattice on the @xmath174-plane .",
    "changing the orientation of the lattice does not alter the compactification , and hence the extra degree of freedom is unphysical .",
    "nevertheless , keeping it in the formalism allows us to highlight an interesting point below .",
    "we can now deform the torus slightly by shifting the lattice vectors .",
    "in terms of the components of the lattice vectors , the deformation of the torus is parameterized by @xmath182 as we did in the @xmath1 case in section ( [ whereitsat ] ) , we label the coordinates on the deformed torus with tildes , so that the deformed torus is given by the @xmath183-plane subject to the identifications @xmath184 we will see that the first law for @xmath15 kaluza - klein black holes can be stated succinctly if we treat the torus as an elastic medium ( see _ e.g. _ reference @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is useful to compute the strain tensor corresponding to the deformation of the torus described above .",
    "this is defined in the following way .",
    "if the positions of points in an elastic medium are deformed from their original positions according to the vector field @xmath185 , then the strain tensor @xmath18 is given by @xmath186 .    in order to calculate the strain tensor for the deformed @xmath15 , we need to be able to identify every point on the deformed torus with a point on the undeformed torus .",
    "to do this we transform from the coordinates @xmath187 with identifications ( [ deformed ] ) back to the original coordinates @xmath188 with the identifications ( [ torusident ] ) .",
    "the transformation is given by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the volume of the undeformed torus , and we are working to first order in the deformation parameters @xmath191 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "we can now think of the deformation of the torus in the following way .",
    "the coordinates @xmath188 specify a point on the undeformed torus , and @xmath194 are the coordinates of the same point on the deformed torus .",
    "the displacement vector @xmath195 is then given by @xmath196 and the strain tensor is found to be @xmath197 note in particular , that the trace of @xmath18 gives the fractional change in volume of the torus @xmath198 the trace - free symmetric part of @xmath199 gives the shear part of the deformation , while the antisymmetric part gives a rotation of the torus on the @xmath174 plane . as we noted above ,",
    "such a rotation does not physically alter the torus , and we will see below that indeed the antisymmetric part of the strain tensor does not contribute to the first law .",
    "let us denote the moduli of the @xmath15 collectively by @xmath200 with @xmath201 and we include the unphysical rotational degree of freedom . if we consider variations around a @xmath15 kaluza - klein black hole with the values of the moduli held fixed , @xmath202 , then the results of section ( [ lzero ] ) apply and the first law again has the form ( [ basiclaw ] ) .",
    "we can now consider variations in the moduli as well .",
    "following the considerations above in section ( [ whereitsat ] ) , we can then write an analogue of equation ( [ workhorse ] ) for the @xmath15 case , @xmath203 moreover , the adm mass depends on the moduli only through the overall volume of the @xmath15 , as in equation ( [ t2mass ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath204 combining these last two equations gives @xmath205 in order to calculate the contributions to ( [ t2workhorse ] ) that come from varying the moduli , we return to equation ( [ almost - there ] ) , which we reproduce here @xmath206 we will keep only terms proportional to the variations of the moduli .",
    "we then need only consider then , the components of the metric perturbation @xmath207 for the torus directions . as we did for the @xmath1 case in section ( [ whereitsat ] )",
    ", we must calculate the perturbation to the metric @xmath207 in the original @xmath188 coordinate system on the @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ in which the coordinates have the identifications ( [ torusident ] ) .",
    "let @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "to linear order in the variations of the moduli , we can then write the coordinate transformation ( [ tildecoords ] ) as @xmath210 since we are working to linear order in perturbations and keeping only terms proportional to the variations in the moduli , the metric @xmath211 on torus in the coordinates @xmath212 can be taken to equal the background metric @xmath213 in ( [ t2asymptotics ] ) , @xmath214 in this coordinate system , the metric perturbation is encoded in the varied identifications ( [ deformed ] ) . transforming to the coordinates",
    "@xmath215 with the original identifications then gives @xmath216 the perturbation to the metric @xmath217 coming from the deformation of the @xmath15 is then given explicitly by @xmath218 in these original coordinates , we see the metric perturbation has both terms that go to constants at infinity and terms that decay like @xmath219 .    from the metric perturbation , we can now calculate the right hand side of equation ( [ t2workhorse ] ) , with the result @xmath220 this result in turn can be plugged into equation ( [ anotherequation ] ) , which after making use of equation ( [ explicitmass ] ) can be processed into the form @xmath221 this last expression looks quite complicated . however , if one looks at equation ( [ almostt2 ] ) with equations ( [ straintensor ] ) and ( [ tensiontensor ] ) for the strain and tension tensors in mind , one sees that equation ( [ almostt2 ] ) can be rewritten in the simple form @xmath222 this completes the derivation of the first law for @xmath15 kaluza - klein black holes ) for @xmath1 kaluza - klein black holes , one might be surprised by the prefactor of @xmath17that appears in the work term for the @xmath15 case .",
    "however , if one computes the strain of the @xmath1 following the definitions of section ( [ t2-deform ] ) , one finds that @xmath223 .",
    "hence , the work term in the @xmath1 case , when expressed in terms of the strain , becomes @xmath224 in parallel with the @xmath15 case .",
    "recall that the antisymmetric part of the strain tensor represents a rotation of the basic cell of the @xmath15 within the euclidean plane , leaving its size and shape unchanged .",
    "this mode is present because we kept all four of the components of the lattice basis vectors in our formalism , which is one more degree of freedom that needed .",
    "it follows from the first law , however , that because the tension tensor is symmetric , the antisymmetric part of the strain tensor makes no contribution .",
    "in this paper we have studied how variations in the moduli enter the first law for kaluza - klein black holes . following the introduction and some basic formulas in the opening sections , in section ( [ examples ] ) we discussed two simple examples , the uniform black string and the kaluza - klein bubble , that illustrate how the first law for kaluza - klein black holes operates in practice .",
    "the formula for the adm mass in these spacetimes is simply proportional to the length of the @xmath1 .",
    "however , when this length is varied we saw that holding the horizon area fixed for the black string , or preventing a conical singularity for the bubble , does indeed yield a change in mass proportional to the tension , in accordance with the first law .",
    "in section ( [ theproof ] ) we presented a derivation of the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) for @xmath1 kaluza - klein black holes @xcite based on the hamiltonian methods of references @xcite .",
    "we highlighted how the @xmath225 work term arises from a careful treatment of the boundary term at infinity in equation ( [ almost - there ] ) .",
    "this careful treatment was necessary because when the moduli are varied , certain components of the metric perturbations have constant pieces at infinity .    in section ( [ for - t2 ] )",
    "we used the hamiltonian methods to derive a new result , the first law ( [ toruslaw ] ) for @xmath15 kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "we saw that the statement of the first law , in this case , takes a simple form if we consider the @xmath15 to be an elastic body , which is deformed by varying the moduli .",
    "the resulting work term is given by the contraction of the strain tensor for the deformed @xmath15 with the tension tensor , which was defined in section ( [ t2-tension ] ) , times a factor of the overall volume of the @xmath15 .    two interesting directions to pursue",
    "further are the following first , if we consider @xmath226 kaluza - klein black holes with @xmath227 , it seems quite likely that the first law will in general take the form ( [ toruslaw ] ) that we have found in the @xmath15 case .",
    "however , the derivation we have given in the @xmath15 case , involving the explicit representation of the moduli given in section ( [ t2-deform ] ) , will likely prove cumbersome to extend to the general case",
    ". it would be nice to find a more streamlined derivation .",
    "second , we would like to consider more general ricci - flat compactifications , such as calabi - yau manifolds . in this case",
    ", we would also expect the results to be phrased in terms of a strain tensor that encodes the deformation of the manifold as the moduli are varied .",
    "however , the definition of the strain tensor used in section ( [ t2-deform ] ) makes use of the representation of a @xmath15 as the euclidean plane identified under a lattice of translations . to handle non - flat spaces ,",
    "a more intrinsic definition of the strain tensor in terms of metric perturbations is necessary .",
