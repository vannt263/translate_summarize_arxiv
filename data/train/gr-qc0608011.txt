    "reflection of electromagnetic ( em ) waves in general relativity is totally different from its counterpart process of classical electromagnetism .",
    "while in the latter the incident em wave is partly reflected and transmitted , the reflector remains unaffected .",
    "corresponding process in general relativity is a completely different process , as a manifestation of inherent non - linearity the reflector wave pulse is modified as well .",
    "thus exact solution of the full einstein - maxwell ( em ) equations respecting all boundary conditions becomes indispensable .",
    "the problem of colliding em waves with gravitational waves has not yet been solved in the general case but only in particular situations .",
    "the solution by griffiths corresponds to the most elementary one @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "closely related to the subject are the solutions of colliding impulsive light - like signals @xcite and the light - like shells with impulsive gravitational waves in scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the problem of reflection is interesting  in the sense that it incorporates a nonsymmetrical initial data in the collision process .",
    "the exact analytic solution is obtained with an imposed condition that  one of the metric functions characterising the gravitational degrees of freedom depend only on one of the null coordinates as it was in the pre - collision region .",
    "significant reduction in the field equations follows as a result of this condition .    in griffiths s work ,",
    "exact solutions for two different cases were given ; one corresponding to an impulsive , the other to a shock gravitational wave .",
    "the main feature of the problem is that the em wave partly reflects from the gravitational wave while the latter does not reflect from the em wave . as a result of the nonlinear interaction a coulomb - like ( i.e. @xmath0 in the newman - penrose formalism ) component develops apart from the modified wave component @xmath1 .",
    "another feature in this process is that in the interaction region a space - like curvature singularity necessarily develops .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present new extensions to the same physical process by employing the solution of griffiths .",
    "one of the extensions is to consider the collision and interaction of plane gravitational radiation and em waves in the presence of a massless scalar field .",
    "another extension is to consider the non - linear interaction of a plane em wave with the succesion of plane impulsive gravitational waves .    the main motivation to consider the scalar field in this problem is that , in recent years there is a growing literature around the subject of scalar field cosmology .",
    "with this in mind , it would be physically interesting to investigate the effect of scalar field taking part in the reflection problem of em waves .",
    "in addition to this , we are aiming to find a non - singular cauchy horizon ( ch ) forming reflection process . to incorporate scalar fields in this direction ,",
    "we construct ch forming einstein - scalar and em - scalar plane wave packets that propagate in the opposite directions in each of the incoming regions as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the resulting space - time is as a result of the collision of these wave packets .",
    "the gravitational wave in our problem has a different structure compared to the cases considered in the references @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in the problem considered ,",
    "the gravitational radiation is composed of a plane impulsive part accompanied with shock waves .",
    "the obtained solution has revealed in contrast to our expectation that , it does not yield a ch forming reflection process .",
    "our solution implies that the em wave still partly reflects from the gravitational wave irrespective of the presence of the scalar field .",
    "following the collision , the resulting space - time has the @xmath1 and @xmath0 components and they are both unbounded as the focusing hypersurface is approached .",
    "general feature of the problem has not been changed with the insertion of the scalar field , but we have shown that a particular choice of the scalar field makes @xmath2 , with the only non - zero component @xmath1 .",
    "this provides a unique example in which the scalar field can rule the gravitational field .",
    "another extension is naturally provided by considering an em wave that encounters a train of impulsive gravitational waves ( i.e. the dirac s comb ) .",
    "the solution describes simply , how the em wave reflects from the successive gravitational impulsive waves . in principle",
    "the problem is one pertaining to multiple reflection but idealized choice of gravitational impulsive wave train renders an exact solution possible .",
    "we show that the result is similar to the single impulsive wave case , with the additional property that the reflecting maxwell component changes sign while crossing from one wave to the next .",
    "this fact may play role in the identification of succesive impulsive gravitational waves which remain still elusive to any detection technique .",
    "the whole discussion can also be extended to a gravitational wave with non - aligned polarization , however for convenience reasons we shall restrict ourselves in this paper to the linear polarization .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we construct ch forming einstein - scalar and em - scalar plane wave spacetimes . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the collision and subsequent interaction of these wave packets . a particular scalar field that makes @xmath2",
    "is analysed in section 4 .",
    "reflection of an em wave from a succession of impulsive waves follows in section 5 and we complete the paper with our conclusion in section 6 .",
    "in order to obtain ch forming solutions with scalar fields we choose ch forming pure em and pure gravitational solutions known beforehand .",
    "for the pure gravitational solution we choose the solution found by yurtsever @xcite and independently by ferrari and ibanez @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of this solution is that , its interaction region is isometric to the part of the interior region of the schwarzschild black hole .    as for the pure em case",
    "we employ the well - known bell - szekeres solution @xcite .",
    "the scalar field is added to both solutions by the @xmath3__-shift _ _ method which we had explained elsewhere @xcite . for completeness",

    "we wish to add that by shifting @xmath101 the foregoing solution remains intact while the physical interpretation ( see fig(2 ) ) changes drastically @xcite : an incoming em field coupled with a scalar field characterized by the step function @xmath102 reflects from a curved region valid for @xmath103 @xmath104 and transforms into an outgoing gravitational field coupled with scalar wave .",

    "we remind also that the case of shock gravitational waves is different . the problem of colliding em wave with a shock sandwich wave in which the incoming weyl scalar is of the form @xmath128   , \\ ] ]",

    "clearly this case has a uniform curvature filling the sandwich and is entirely different from the present case .",
    "the solution of colliding em wave ( with the same initial data as in the previous section and without the scalar field ) is given by @xmath129    where  @xmath106 and @xmath107 are given in terms of the impulsive waves in succession . for _",
    "2-waves _ and _ 3-waves _  cases we have given them explicitly in ( 57 ) and ( 59 ) .",
    "it is observed that although the maxwell component @xmath130 remains unaffected by the successive waves , @xmath15 component changes sign each time when the em wave encounters a new wavefront .",
    "this amounts to a phase change by @xmath131 of the reflected @xmath15 component of the em wave .",
    "overall effect is that if it crosses an even number of impulsive waves we have @xmath132 while for an odd number of waves the sign remains unchanged .",
    "this sign change is physically significant since it shows itself in the em invariant @xmath133 .    to conclude this section we state that by the _",
    "m - shift _ method we can easily extend the present consideration of successive impulsive waves to the case of einstein - maxwell - scalar case , which we shall not elaborate .",
    "it is shown that reflection of em waves from gravitational waves with added scalar fields and with superposition of impulsive waves still satisfies the solution given long time ago by griffiths .",
    "solutions were also found in the past in which gravitational waves reflect from scalar waves while em waves do not reflect from scalar waves @xcite . in particular",
    "we choose our initial data from the ch forming waves to see whether a non - singular reflection process results .",
    "our conclusion is that the mutual focusing is still quite strong to yield a curvature singularity .",
    "it remains open to find a ch forming reflection process yet .",
    "we can also exploit the presence of the scalar field by making a particular choice which sets @xmath2 , giving rise to a novel case without a coulomb component in the interaction region .",
    "we have given also a counter example ( the khan - penrose case ) which implies that this condition can not be generic .",
    "the second part of the paper presents a multiple reflection process of an em wave from layers of successive impulsive gravitational waves . while @xmath130 remains invariant ,  @xmath15",
    "is multiplied by @xmath134 , for @xmath135 , representing the number of superposed waves .",
    "this succesive sign flip in the maxwell spinor is the precursor of a train of gravitational impulsive waves and may be searched for an indirect evidence of the latter . as a final remark",
    "we note that the reflection process is applicable only to a linearly polarized em wave .",
    "if cross - polarized em wave is considered , the condition @xmath78 ( and @xmath136 ) remains no more feasible @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether it works in higher dimensional string theory where scalar field is replaced by dilaton and em field is replaced by the higher form fields . from physics standpoint it is an utmost important and fashionable problem nowadays to understand the classical scattering of wave packets in general relativity since black holes are believed to be produced in abundance in such processes @xcite . while investing much effort on reflections from the horizons of black holes , it will not be adequate to ignore reflection processes of waves from other systems , as considered in this paper .",
