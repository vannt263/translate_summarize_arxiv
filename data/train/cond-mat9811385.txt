    "one strategy to answer the many questions concerning the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors is the study of model substances .",
    "one of these compounds is sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 .",
    "it is a two dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator with a nel temperature @xcite of 256 k whose magnetic structure is well described by the 2d spin 1/2 heisenberg - model .",
    "it was the first undoped cuprate which allowed the angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurement of its lowest excitations .",
    "@xcite these excitations are well described by one hole in a 2d quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "@xcite deviations from the one - hole dispersion of the pure @xmath8-@xmath9 model can be reduced by taking into account hopping terms to second and third neighbors .",
    "@xcite in the same substance the low binding energy edge of the main valence band has been interpreted in terms of non - bonding oxygen orbitals which are completely decoupled from the copper system .",
    "@xcite ( these features were known before as `` 1 ev - peak '' . ) @xcite these non - bonding states are especially pronounced at @xmath10 where they have minimal binding energy .",
    "but the detailed structure of the complete valence band has never been analyzed up to now and that is the aim of the present work .",
    "furthermore , we will show that one can obtain additional information on the low binding - energy features by analyzing their dependence on the polarization of the photon .",
    "polarization dependent photoemission measurements are an effective tool to analyze the electronic structure of the valence band in detail . by measuring along high - symmetry directions",
    "all bands can be classified according to their symmetry properties .",
    "this allows a very precise comparison between experiment and different theoretical predictions .",
    "it is well established that in all the cuprates electron correlations have a strong influence on the electronic bands near the fermi level which is especially pronounced in undoped substances . @xcite but the influence of correlations on those parts of the valence band with larger binding energies is less clear . we will show that the combination of polarization dependent arpes measurements with theoretical investigations taking into account the electron correlation to a differing extent ( lda , lda+u ) provides a unique possibility to answer this question .",
    "the model cuprate sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 is very well suited for such an investigation .",
    "it has a tetragonal structure with ideal planar cuo@xmath0 layers @xcite and cleaves readily parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "furthermore , the presence of cl instead of apex oxygen allows a restriction of the states which contribute to the arpes spectra to those of the pure cuo@xmath0 plane alone .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing a photon energy close to the cooper minimum for cl 3@xmath7 photoemission , i.e. cl 3@xmath7 states will then have a small photon cross section . in this manner",
    "we intend to study an ideal situation whose main characteristics should be generic to all the cuprates .",
    "recently , a similar study was presented for the cu@xmath11o@xmath12 plane of ba@xmath0cu@xmath11o@xmath12cl@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it turns out that sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 is considerably less complex than ba@xmath0cu@xmath11o@xmath12cl@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we are now able to identify _ all _ the peaks at the high symmetry points in contrast to ba@xmath0cu@xmath11o@xmath12cl@xmath0 where only the upper parts of the valence band were analyzed .",
    "this allows implications about the influence of electron correlations on the valence band ( vb ) structure of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 to be made .",
    "it is known that simple lda fails to predict the insulating ground state of undoped cuprates .",
    "@xcite there are several improvements of lda such as the self - interaction correction ( sic ) method @xcite or lda+u @xcite which has already been applied to the case of lanthanum cuprate @xcite ( la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 ) . here",
    ", we apply lda+u plus a symmetry analysis at special @xmath13-points to interprete the polarization dependent photoemission data for sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 , where the actual value of u is chosen to describe the experimental situation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after describing the experimental method and the details of the lda band structure calculation we analyze the symmetry properties of the wave function along high - symmetry directions .",
    "the symmetry properties of the relevant bands are most clearly seen in a tight - binding model presented in sec .",
    "iv . discussing the correlation effects in a mean - field manner leads us to an lda+u calculation whose results are presented in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi we compare the experimental spectra with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the spectra at @xmath1 , @xmath14 and @xmath10 ( the lattice constant has been set to unity in all the notations ) can be understood from the lda+u but not from the lda calculation .",
    "the experimental dispersion relations are discussed in terms of a tight - binding ( tb)-model .",
    "the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 single crystals were grown from the melt , their typical dimensions being 3 @xmath15 3 @xmath15 0.5 mm .",
    "the crystals were mounted on the sample holders using conducting , or in some cases , insulating epoxy .",
    "if insulating epoxy was used , electrical contact between sample holder and sample was achieved by means of a graphite layer at the sides of the crystal .",
    "the orientation of the single crystals was determined ex - situ by x - ray diffraction .",
    "the surface normal of the crystals is perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0 planes . prior to the arpes measurements ,",
    "a clean crystal surface was prepared in ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) by stripping off an adhesive tape which was attached on the sample surface .",
    "the arpes measurements were performed using linearly polarized 35 ev photons from the crossed undulator beamline u2 of the bessy i facility and bessy s hires photoelectron spectrometer .",
    "@xcite the angular resolution was set to @xmath16 which gives a momentum resolution of @xmath17 0.05 @xmath18 for states of 1 ev binding energy , this corresponds to 12 % of the distance between @xmath1 and ( @xmath19,0 ) . a total energy resolution ( resulting from both the monochromator and electron analyzer resolutions ) of 150",
    "mev was applied .",
    "the electron analyzer is fixed in the horizontal plane at an angle of 60@xmath20 with respect to the incoming photon beam , i.e. the emission plane which is defined to be the plane spanned by the sample surface normal and the @xmath13 vectors of the measured photoelectrons , is always a horizontal plane .",
    "the photoelectron momentum vector could then be changed by variation of the angle between the axis of the input lens of the electron analyzer and the sample surface normal by rotation of the manipulator on which the sample holder was mounted .",
    "the arpes spectra have been recorded in the electron distribution curve ( edc ) mode from both @xmath1 to ( @xmath19,@xmath19 ) and @xmath1 to ( @xmath19,0 ) . in the latter case",
    ", the sample was oriented in such a way that the cu - o bonds of the cuo@xmath0 plane were aligned parallel to the fixed , horizontal emission plane , while in the former case , the cu - o bonds were aligned at an angle of 45@xmath20 with respect to the emission plane .",
    "the spectra are normalized with respect to the incoming photon flux which was simultaneously measured using the drain current of a gold mesh .",
    "the absolute binding energy scale was determined according to @xmath21 using the photon energy , the measured kinetic energy of the photoelectrons and the known analyzer work function .",
    "there were no indications of charging - induced energy shifts .",
    "all spectra were recorded at 300 k within 8 hours of a cleave , during which time the samples showed no indications of surface degradation .",
    "the electronic structure of the vb is derived from o 2@xmath7 , cu 3@xmath6 and cl 3@xmath7 orbitals , but for 35 ev photon energy , the photoionization cross section of the cl 3@xmath7 orbitals is much smaller than that of the o 2@xmath7 and cu 3@xmath6 orbitals @xcite , which therefore dominate the arpes vb spectra .",
    "the measurements had been performed at room temperature which is slightly above the nel temperature of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 ( 256 k ) .",
    "although we are aware that afm fluctuations are important , we nevertheless analyzed the spectra in terms of the first brillouin zone ( bz ) of the paramagnetic cuo@xmath0 plane of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 .",
    "we will see that this is especially justified for the bands with dominant oxygen character , whereas one observes some deviations for those bands which couple strongly with the copper spins .",
    "the geometrical structure of a cuo@xmath0 plane has two mirror planes ( denoted m@xmath22 and m@xmath0 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "@xcite all the bands with a wave vector between @xmath1 and @xmath10 , parallel to the mirror plane m@xmath22 , can be classified to be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to m@xmath22 , and analogously also for wave vectors along @xmath23 with respect to reflections at m@xmath0 .",
    "experimental information about the parity of the valence band states with respect to a mirror plane can be obtained by recording the arpes spectra with either perpendicular or parallel polarization of the electric field vector of the incoming radiation with respect to an emission plane which is parallel to a mirror plane of the system .",
    "it can then be shown @xcite that for parallel polarization only initial valence band states which are even with respect to the emission / mirror plane contribute to an arpes spectrum while for perpendicular polarization , only states which are odd with respect to the emission / mirror plane are seen in a spectrum .",
    "in this work , the polarization of the electric field vector was chosen by using either the vertical or horizontal undulator , which corresponds to perpendicular and parallel polarization with respect to the emission plane .",
    "the emission plane is parallel to mirror plane m@xmath22 , if the arpes spectra are recorded along the ( @xmath19,@xmath19 ) direction , while it is parallel to the mirror plane m@xmath0 for spectra along the ( @xmath19,0 ) direction . for perpendicular polarization , the electric field vector is always parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes , i.e. only in - plane orbitals as o 2@xmath24 or cu 3@xmath25 contribute to the spectra .",
    "for parallel polarization , the electric field vector is completely in - plane only at normal - incidence , at any other incidence angle of the photon beam , the electric field vector has an out - of - plane component and there are also contributions from out - of - plane orbitals such as o 2@xmath26 to the arpes spectra .",
    "sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 has a body centered tetragonal crystal structure with the lattice constants @xmath27 and @xmath28  .",
    "@xcite band structure calculations have been performed treating the exchange and correlation potential within the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the bloch wave functions were constructed from atomic - like wavefunctions according to the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) method .",
    "the calculation was scalar relativistic and due to the open crystal structure two empty spheres per elementary cell were introduced in between two oxygen atoms of neighboring cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "a minimal basis was chosen consisting of sr(5@xmath29,5@xmath7,4@xmath6 ) , cu(4@xmath29,4@xmath7,3@xmath6 ) , o(2@xmath29,2@xmath7 ) , cl(3@xmath29,3@xmath7 ) orbitals and the 1@xmath29 and 2@xmath7 orbitals for the empty spheres . to optimize the local basis",
    "a contraction potential @xmath30 was introduced .",
    "@xcite the coulomb potential is constructed as a sum of overlapping contributions of spherical symmetry and for the exchange and correlation potential the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) is used .    in the resulting band structure ( fig .",
    "2 ) one observes an antibonding band built up of cu 3@xmath25 and o 2@xmath24 orbitals crossing the fermi level .",
    "this contradicts the experimentally observed non - metallic behavior which already indicates that one has to treat the electron correlations in a more explicit way .",
    "one could conjecture that the only effect of correlations is to split the half - filled antibonding band leaving the structure of the other valence bands roughly unchanged .",
    "that is not the case , however , as will become clear from our following analysis .",
    "one can also observe in fig .",
    "2 that there is nearly no dispersion of the relevant band in the @xmath31 direction and all discussions in the present paper will be restricted to the cuo@xmath0 plane only .    to check the minimal basis lcao method , a full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw )",
    "calculation has been performed for sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 ( fig .  3 ,",
    "compare also ref . ) .",
    "this method involves no shape approximations and uses a flexible basis in all regions of space .",
    "@xcite as such it is well suited to open structures with low site symmetries as in the present cuprate .",
    "we note a sufficiently good agreement between both band structures , although the lcao - bandwidth of the valence band is found to be somewhat larger . however , there are no significant differences in the order of energy levels between lcao - lda and flapw - lda .",
    "we stick to the lcao because we want to exploit the minimum basis orbital analysis .    to obtain more information about the structure of the valence band in our lcao - lda we have calculated the orbital weight ( defined in ref . ) of each band at the high symmetry points .",
    "due to the low cross section of the cl 3@xmath7 orbitals for 35 ev photon energy we concentrate on the cu 3@xmath6 and o 2@xmath7 orbitals ( i.e.   on 11 bands ) . the eigenfunctions with a dominant contribution from cu 3@xmath6 and o",
    "2@xmath7 orbitals are collected in table 1 .",
    "the in - plane oxygen orbitals are divided into @xmath32 orbitals which are directed to the cu site and @xmath33 orbitals perpendicular to them .",
    "@xcite there are two combinations for each : @xmath32 and @xmath34 , ( @xmath33 and @xmath35 ) , which are antisymmetric and symmetric with respect to reflection in m@xmath22 , respectively . the precise definition of these orbitals will be given in the next section .",
    "thus we are able to predict the symmetry of each band at the high symmetry points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) . however , as will be seen later , the order of energy levels of the lda calculation is incompatible with the experimental spectra .",
    "moreover , as it was mentioned already , lda calculations are unable to describe the mott insulating ground states of the undoped cuprates and do not produce the cu local moments that are present in these systems .",
    "the splitting of the spectral density due to the 3@xmath25 states away from the fermi energy due to coulomb correlations and the resulting reduction in cu - o hybridization is expected to be largely missing in such calculations .",
    "however , what , if any , changes there are from the lda bands away from @xmath36 is unclear , particularly well above @xmath37 , where the magnetic scattering due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations should be more or less incoherent .",
    "addressing this question is one of the main goals of the present paper . in the following",
    "we develop a more sophisticated lda+u calculation taking into account explicitly the effects of strong correlations . as a preliminary step we formulate an effective tight - binding model which will be fitted both to the lda+u band structure calculations and the arpes vb spectra .",
    "the polarization dependent arpes measurements of vb states along the two high - symmetry directions @xmath38 and @xmath23 discriminate the parity of these states with respect to reflections in the corresponding mirror planes m@xmath22 and m@xmath0 . to make the analysis of the experimental data more straightforward it is helpful to incorporate the symmetry properties of the vb states in our approach from the beginning .",
    "this becomes especially clear by constructing an effective tight - binding ( tb ) model taking into account the point - group symmetry of the vb states .",
    "the tb model will be restricted to the 11 bands of cu 3@xmath6 and o 2@xmath7 .",
    "of course , as can be seen in table 1 , there occurs in some cases quite a strong mixing with the cl subsystem , but in the following we will assume that this mixing is taken into account by the particular values of the tb parameters .",
    "we start with the description of in - plane oxygen orbitals whose analysis is more involved than that for the copper or out - of - plane orbitals .",
    "we introduce the annihilation operator of an electron in the two oxygen @xmath19-orbitals belonging to an elementary cell at position @xmath39 ( @xmath39 is a site of the square lattice ) as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 or @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 to be the two orthogonal unit vectors of the lattice .",
    "the @xmath45 orbitals hybridize with a particular combination of oxygen orbitals arranged over the plaquette at site @xmath39 : @xmath46 .",
    "this plaquette s @xmath19-orbitals are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "the orthogonalization can be made by introducing first the fourier transformation for the original @xmath33-orbitals @xmath47 at the second step we define two kinds of canonical fermi - operators @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath33 and @xmath35 are orthogonal with respect to each other .",
    "the definition ( 1 ) provides an equivalent representation for @xmath19-orbitals in terms of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , instead of the original @xmath54 and @xmath55 operators and takes into account the point group symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "in particular , for @xmath56 along @xmath38 , the @xmath33-orbital is antisymmetric with respect to reflections in the mirror plane @xmath57 , while the @xmath58-orbital is symmetric ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "along @xmath23 , we find @xmath33 to be symmetric and @xmath35 to be antisymmetric with respect to reflection in @xmath59 .",
    "turning now to the oxygen @xmath60-orbitals we carry out the same procedure as above with the corresponding @xmath61 operators ( @xmath62 ) . in this case , introducing the plaquette representation instead of defining the original @xmath63 operators in momentum space , we define a new pair of canonical fermi - operators @xmath32 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 @xmath66 the notation is chosen in such a way that the @xmath67-orbitals have the same symmetry properties with respect to reflections at m@xmath22 and m@xmath0 as the @xmath52 or @xmath53-orbitals , respectively .",
    "the definition of the corresponding copper annihilation operators is quite standard and thus we may write down the tb hamiltonian @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is an annihilation operator of either an oxygen @xmath7 orbital or a copper @xmath6 orbital , where the indices @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the 11 different orbitals and @xmath29 denotes the spin .",
    "all orbitals can be classified as to whether they hybridize in - plane or out - of - plane and there is no coupling between the two subsystems .",
    "the orbitals involved in the hybridisation in - plane are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath64 , @xmath35 , @xmath25 , @xmath45 , @xmath72 .",
    "the explicit form of the tb - hamiltonian for in - plane orbitals is given in the appendix .",
    "the in - plane part of the tb - model has 11 parameters : the on - site energies @xmath73 ( for @xmath25 ) , @xmath74 ( for @xmath45 ) and @xmath75 ( for @xmath76 ) as well as @xmath77 ( corresponding to @xmath32 ) and @xmath78 ; the hopping matrix elements @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . besides the orbitals hybridising in - plane we have to consider those involved in hybridization out - of - plane : o 2@xmath26 , cu 3@xmath85 and cu 3@xmath86 . restricting ourselves to nearest neighbor hopping",
    "leads to two 2 @xmath15 2 matrices with on - site energies @xmath87 and @xmath88 and the hopping matrix element @xmath89 .    in order to analyze the experiment",
    "it is important to know the parity of the orbitals with respect to reflections at the corresponding mirror planes m@xmath22 and m@xmath0 .",
    "this can also be expressed in terms of group theory since for @xmath13 vectors along the line @xmath38 all wave functions can be classified in terms of irreducible representations of the small group @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite the bands built up from the in - plane orbitals @xmath45 , @xmath72 , @xmath64 and @xmath35 belong to the representation @xmath91 and are symmetric with respect to reflections at m@xmath22 , whereas @xmath25 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 belong to @xmath92 and are antisymmetric .",
    "the same small group @xmath90 also acts along @xmath93 and the subdivision of the in - plane orbitals is as follows : @xmath91 ( symmetric ) : @xmath25 , @xmath72 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath92 ( antisymmetric ) : @xmath45 , @xmath64 , @xmath35 .",
    "the subdivision along high - symmetry lines is also easily seen in the tb - matrix given in the appendix .",
    "the corresponding small groups at the high - symmetry points @xmath1 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , and the assignment of the different orbitals to the corresponding irreducible representations is given in table 2 .",
    "of course , the group theoretical analysis is not only valid for the tb model but also for the lda bands ( table 1 ) .",
    "the tb - hamiltonian ( [ tb ] ) should be completed by an interaction term @xmath96 which will not be written out explicitly .",
    "this is just a direct extension of the three - band emery model to the case of the complete set of 11 bands for the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "the interaction term @xmath97 involves intrasite hubbard repulsion for different kinds of copper and oxygen orbitals and appropriate intersite copper - oxygen repulsions . in order to establish the one - electron parameters entering into eq .",
    "( [ htu ] ) one has to keep in mind that these parameters are `` bare '' ones while the results of the band structure calculations should be interpreted in terms of a mean - field solution of eq .",
    "( [ htu ] ) .",
    "@xcite to arrive at the bare parameters , one would have to take into account the ground - state ( gs ) properties of the cuo@xmath0 plane and approximate the coulomb interaction terms .    in an undoped cuprate compound as sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 ,",
    "the gs of a particular cuo@xmath0 plane contains one hole per cell which is shared between @xmath25 and @xmath32 orbitals .",
    "thus a convenient description of the gs is to introduce the deviations @xmath98 and @xmath99 from the full band ( cu 3@xmath100 o 2@xmath101 ) electron occupancy .",
    "a rough estimate is @xmath102 and @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath104 means the electron number in the @xmath32 orbital with spin @xmath29 ( one should note that the occupation of a local oxygen orbital is only half that number ) .",
    "now the mean - field ( `` screened '' ) one - electron energies @xmath105 read as follows @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "there are also similar expressions for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 which we do not specify here .    in the paramagnetic lda band structure where the correlation effects are treated only in an averaged manner ,",
    "the screening effect is nearly the same for all @xmath6-levels .",
    "so , in the lda approach the effects of strong correlations due to @xmath111 are missed .",
    "an obvious way to adopt these effects is to treat the ferromagnetic solution by putting , for instance , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . then @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "is shifted upwards while @xmath116 is shifted equally downwards with respect to the paramagnetic solution .",
    "regarding the other @xmath6-levels , let us assume for the moment the rough estimate for the intrasite coulomb parameters @xmath117",
    ". then one can see that @xmath118 , and the @xmath45 level as well as all the other remaining cu @xmath6-levels are shifted as was the lower @xmath119 .",
    "the spin dependence of @xmath120 in ( [ e5 ] ) is much less pronounced than for @xmath121 and is neglected in the following .",
    "thus , although being somewhat awkward , the ferromagnetic solution provides a better description of the strong electron correlations , giving a more reasonable energy position and occupancy of the different orbitals .",
    "just this approach is taken by us to carry out the lda+u calculation .",
    "the details of the procedure and some results of these calculation are presented in the next section .",
    "the main effect of a mean - field treatment of the multi - band hubbard model is a shift of the on - site copper energies against the oxygen ones .",
    "furthermore , the on - site energy of the cu 3@xmath25 orbital is split into one for spin up @xmath122 ( minority spin ) and @xmath119 ( majority spin ) .",
    "this can also be achieved by an lda+u calculation @xcite including all valence orbitals .",
    "we performed lda+u calculations for sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 using a ferromagnetic splitting .",
    "the on - site energy of the unoccupied , spin up cu 3@xmath123 orbital ( minority spin ) is shifted by 2 ev upwards and the occupied , spin down cu 3@xmath124 orbital ( majority spin ) , as well as both spin directions for all the remaining cu 3@xmath6 orbitals are shifted by 2 ev downwards .",
    "the energy shifts were added at each step of the self - consistency cycle until the charge - distribution was stable .",
    "we did not try to connect the chosen energy shifts with the model parameters such as , for instance , @xmath125 . according to ( [ e5 ] ) ,",
    "the actual shift depends also on the occupation numbers @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "since we did not shift the oxygen levels , our choice corresponds in fact to the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath128 weighted with the corresponding occupation numbers .",
    "the results of our lda+u calculation are presented in fig .  5 and table 3 .",
    "the mainly unoccupied , minority band of @xmath25 and @xmath32 character can be roughly interpreted as the upper hubbard band .",
    "the corresponding band for majority spin lies just below the fermi level and has dominantly oxygen character .",
    "since its spin is opposite to the spin of the copper hole , there is some justification to interprete that band as the mean field representation of the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "but due to our ferromagnetic spin structure it has completely the wrong dispersion relation .",
    "@xcite the bandwidth of both bands is expected to be strongly reduced by correlation effects in comparison with fig .",
    "5 such that a gap opens .",
    "next in binding energy we find bands with dominantly oxygen character . the nonbonding oxygen band with lowest binding energy at @xmath10 is identified to be of pure @xmath33 character .",
    "the oxygen bands occur at nearly the same energy for both spin directions .",
    "in fact , only the bands with a considerable weight of the cu 3@xmath25 orbital show a strong splitting between spin up and spin down .",
    "therefore we present in table 3 only the position of minority spin bands and both spin directions for bands with a contribution from the 3@xmath25 orbital .",
    "@xcite the actual value of the energy shifts of the copper bands in our lda+u calculation has little influence on the upper oxygen bands , only their copper character is changed .",
    "we have chosen such a shift that the copper bands are at the lower edge of the valence band , but are not yet split off the valence band .",
    "this is important in order to achieve good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "let us now compare the lda and lda+u results starting at @xmath10 . in both cases ( figs .  2 and 5 )",
    ", we find a group of 5 bands at around 3 ev binding energy , but the order of energy levels is completely different in the two cases .",
    "for example , the antisymmetric @xmath33 band has lowest binding energy of @xmath129 2.5 ev in the lda+u calculation . in fig .  2 ( lcao - lda )",
    ", however , all the other 4 bands of that group have lower binding energy than the @xmath33 level . and also in the flapw calculation ( fig .",
    "3 ) the @xmath33 band has 0.3 ev larger binding energy than the valence band edge .",
    "a similar rearrangement of energy levels can be observed at the @xmath1 point . due to symmetry reasons",
    "there is no hybridization between copper and oxygen bands there .",
    "the energy position of the oxygen bands is nearly the same for lda and lda+u , but the copper bands are shifted .",
    "the in - plane oxygen bands are twofold degenerate and occur twice in the lda+u result with binding energies of 2.69 and 5.57 ev , respectively .",
    "the experimental arpes spectra at the high symmetry points for both polarization directions are presented in fig .",
    "6 . at the @xmath1 point",
    ", there are two possible orientations of the sample such that one can probe the symmetry of states with respect to reflections in either m@xmath22 ( sample directed such that the photoelectron momentum is along @xmath38 , fig .",
    "6a ) , or m@xmath0 ( sample directed such that the photoelectron momentum is along @xmath23 , fig .",
    "the first peak at 2.9 ev binding energy in the experimental spectra at the @xmath1 point with the sample oriented such that the @xmath13-vector is along @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "6a ) is equally strong for both polarization directions .",
    "this leads us to interprete it as the two pure oxygen bands @xmath130 and @xmath131 which are antisymmetric and symmetric with respect to reflections at m@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "@xcite these bands occur in the lda+u calculation as the two - fold degenerate in - plane oxygen bands at 2.69 ev binding energy . according to this interpretation",
    "we would expect the same identical peak for both spin directions also at the @xmath1 point with the sample oriented such that the @xmath13-vector is along @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "as one can see , fig .",
    "6b deviates only slightly from that expectation . in the lda result",
    ", however , there are 3 copper levels between 2.3 and 3 ev binding energy . since every copper level has different symmetry properties with respect to m@xmath22 and m@xmath0 that would lead to strong differences between both polarization directions which is not observed .",
    "therefore , we assign each experimental peak with the help of the lda+u results . each pure band",
    "is denoted by one orbital only . for the mixed bands we choose a notation using two orbitals , where the first one is the dominant one .",
    "the experimental peak positions are compared with the lda+u positions in table 4 .",
    "let us continue our interpretation of the spectra at the @xmath1 point with the peak at 3.9 ev .",
    "it is seen with horizontal polarization in figs .",
    "6a and 6b .",
    "therefore , we interprete it as the out - of - plane oxygen @xmath26 orbital .",
    "we observe also a small contribution of this peak with the `` wrong '' polarization in fig.6a which is even larger in fig .",
    "6b . however , there is no band with the corresponding symmetry in that energy region in our lda+u calculation .",
    "the large peaks at around 6 ev binding energy in figs .",
    "6a and 6b with big differences between both polarization directions indicate that there are additional contributions besides the oxygen orbitals there . due to the low cross section of cl 3@xmath7 orbitals ,",
    "we are only left with the pure copper @xmath6 orbitals . to simplify the analysis",
    "we did not try to assign the cu 3@xmath76 orbital which mixes strongly with the cl orbitals and should have reduced intensity .",
    "the remaining in - plane copper orbitals change their polarization dependence between fig .",
    "6a and 6b .",
    "the @xmath124 is antisymmetric with respect to m@xmath22 and the @xmath45 is symmetric , but with the sample oriented such that the @xmath13-vector is along @xmath23 this situation is reversed .",
    "the intensity ratio between horizontal and vertical polarization of the peak at 5.8 ev is indeed exchanged if we compare fig .",
    "6a and 6b .",
    "the last peak at 6.5 ev occurs for both sample orientations only with horizontal polarization and is interpreted as the out - of - plane @xmath85 or @xmath86 orbital .",
    "turning now to the spectra at @xmath10 we can only probe the parity with respect to m@xmath22 ( fig .",
    "the small prepeak at 1.2 ev in the curve with vertical polarization is ususally interpreted as the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "@xcite the dominant peak at 2.4 ev binding energy in the spectra with perpendicular polarization can be identified as the pure @xmath33 orbital which has already been discussed in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath33 band is the only one among the group of 5 bands at around 3 ev binding energy in both calculations ( lda or lda+u , figs .  2 and 5 ) which has odd symmetry with respect to m@xmath22 .",
    "it has lowest binding energy in the experiment and in the lda+u calculation .",
    "that indicates that the lda+u calculation is better in predicting the correct order of energy levels at high symmetry points than the pure lda calculation . at slightly higher binding energy at 2.7 ev",
    "we observe a smaller , broader peak with horizontal polarization . according to our calculation",
    "it should be comprised of three bands , the out - of - plane @xmath132 bands and the in - plane @xmath133 band .",
    "the small structure at 3.8 ev binding energy ( vertical polarization ) can be related to the oxygen @xmath32 orbital hybridizing with @xmath25 but having opposite spin ( @xmath134 ) than that of the copper hole .",
    "the corresponding band occurs in the lda+u at 4.94 ev binding energy and can be interpreted as the zhang - rice triplet .",
    "a similar structure was also observed in our previous analysis of the polarization dependent photoemission spectra of another undoped model cuprate ba@xmath0cu@xmath11o@xmath12cl@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    the peaks at around 6 ev binding energy should be assigned to bands with a dominant copper character .",
    "but one may note in table 4 a systematic deviation between experimental and theoretical peak positions at @xmath10 : the theoretical binding energies are too large .",
    "that is plausible since it is expected that the copper bands feel the antiferromagnetic correlations much more than the oxygen bands which are decoupled from the copper spins . as a result",
    "the copper bands are expected to follow more the afm bz where @xmath1 and @xmath10 are identical .",
    "however , such afm correlations were not considered in our calculation .    at @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "6d ) one may observe a prepeak with low intensity which may be prescribed to the zhang - rice singlet state comprised in our calculation by the hybridization between the @xmath32 orbital and @xmath124 .",
    "the strong peak with horizontal polarization at 2.5 ev is assigned to the out - of - plane @xmath135 orbital .",
    "the peak at 3.8 ev consists of two orbitals @xmath26 and @xmath33 which are separated by only 0.5 ev in the lda+u calculation .",
    "therefore it is difficult to use that peak to extract the parameter @xmath83 from the experimental spectra as it was done in ref . .",
    "furthermore , one should distinguish between different oxygen hopping matrix elements ( @xmath82 , @xmath84 and @xmath83)@xcite which was also not done there.@xcite      the experimental spectra along both high symmetry directions show clear differences between both polarization directions ( figs .",
    "the first electron removal peak along @xmath136 has minimal binding energy at @xmath137 and occurs exclusively with vertical polarization ( fig.7 ) .",
    "that is in complete agreement with the usual interpretation of that peak as the zhang - rice singlet . in our mean - field treatment",
    "it is built up of the @xmath124 and @xmath32 orbitals having odd symmetry with respect to m@xmath22 .",
    "the dispersion is well described within the extended @xmath8-@xmath9 model @xcite and we have included the corresponding theoretical curve in fig .  7 for completeness . along @xmath138 ( figs . 9 and 10 ) the zhang - rice singlet feature is less pronounced and according to our symmetry analysis based on a simple mean - field treatment we would expect it only with horizontal polarization . however it is more clearly seen in fig .  9 ( vertical polarisation ) than in fig",
    ".  10 ( horizontal polarisation ) .",
    "the explanation of that effect deserves obviously a more refined treatment and will be studied both theoretically and experimentally in the future .",
    "the peak next in binding energy in fig .",
    "7 was already analyzed as the @xmath33 orbital and it has a clear dispersion going from @xmath1 to @xmath10 .",
    "the valence band edge at around 2.5 ev binding energy is different for both polarizations along @xmath138 as well : it has no dispersion for vertical polarization ( fig .",
    "9 ) and is built up of only one ( @xmath35 ) orbital .",
    "in contrast to that , we see for horizontal polarization ( fig .",
    "10 ) one dispersionless out - of - plane band at 3.9 ev and two crossing bands from the out - of - plane orbitals and the in - plane @xmath33 band .",
    "to analyse this dispersion quantitatively it is more convenient to use the tb model than the lda+u calculation due to the restricted number of bands in the former .",
    "the parameters of the tb model were found as follows .",
    "the lda+u results at high symmetry points ( table 3 ) were used to obtain a first parameter set .",
    "for the fit we have only chosen such energy levels which have no or very small contribution from other orbitals ( cu 4@xmath29 , o 3@xmath29 , cl ) . in such a way our effective tb parameters also contain the influence of hybridization to cl or @xmath29 orbitals .",
    "fitting to the pure lda results ( table 1 ) gave nearly the same hopping integrals but different on - site energies .",
    "the parameters are very similar to those known for la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite after fitting to the lda+u results there remained small differences to the experimental dispersions even for the peaks with lowest binding energy .",
    "these small discrepancies to the experimental peak positions were corrected by small changes of the on - site and off - site energies ( here , especially @xmath89 was increased ) .",
    "the resulting parameter set is shown in table 5 .    in fig .",
    "11 we have collected all the peak positions from figs .  7 - 10 together with the dispersion of the tb bands .",
    "we have distinguished between the results for vertical polarization ( fig .",
    "11a ) and horizontal polarization ( fig .",
    "according to our previous analysis , the peaks in fig .",
    "11a between @xmath14 and @xmath1 should only be compared with the 3 tb bands stemming from the @xmath64 , @xmath35 and @xmath45 orbitals .",
    "analogously , between @xmath1 and @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "11a ) we present only the antisymmetric bands from the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath124 and @xmath123 orbitals . in fig .",
    "11 , we have collected the bands arising from both the @xmath124 or @xmath123 orbitals , and have neglected the band corresponding to the zhang - rice singlet since we can not expect to obtain its correct dispersion in our simple mean - field treatment .",
    "the number of bands which contribute to the spectra for horizontal polarization ( fig .",
    "11b ) is considerably larger : these include all of the out - of - plane orbitals and additionally the corresponding symmetric bands ( representation @xmath91 of @xmath90 ) of the in - plane orbitals .    in fig .",
    "11 we have distinguished between bands with dominant oxygen character for all @xmath13 values ( solid lines ) and those bands which have a considerable coupling to the copper spins ( dashed lines ) . as one may note , there is a considerable agreement between experimental and theoretical dispersions for the oxygen bands with small binding energy .",
    "furthermore , there is some similarity at the @xmath1 point besides the peak with vertical polarization at 3.9 ev binding energy for which we have no explanation .",
    "but the copper bands at around 6 ev disperse strongly in the tb calculation whereas they are nearly dispersionless in the experiment .",
    "we think that this failure of the theoretical description arises due to the neglect of antiferromagnetic correlations . to avoid misunderstanding",
    "we should stress that also the oxygen bands of our mean - field calculation have a copper contribution ( except some cases at the high - symmetry points ) , but that the copper contribution is not dominant .",
    "we have also shown the calculated dispersion relations of the oxygen bands in figs .  7 - 10 as solid lines in order to guide the eye .",
    "it can be summarized that polarization dependent arpes at @xmath1 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 and along the two high - symmetry directions gives detailed information about the bands with different parity with respect to reflections at the mirror planes m@xmath22 and m@xmath0 .",
    "the assignment of the peaks can be performed by means of a symmetry analysis of band structure results . here",
    "we pick out the three major results .",
    "* rearrangement of energy levels . * comparing lda with lda+u results at high - symmetry points we found that the strong electron correlation leads to a changed order of energy levels , whereby the experimental peak positions could be more accurately assigned with the help of the lda+u calculation . in comparison with an lda calculation we found the copper bands shifted to higher binding energy .",
    "so , we conclude that the correlation influences not only the band near the fermi level but leads to a rearrangement of energy levels throughout the whole vb",
    ".    * check of the non - bonding @xmath33 band .",
    "* polarization dependent arpes measurements provide a sensitive test of the symmetries of the excitations with low binding energy which were already analyzed before .",
    "the @xmath33 orbital is seen at @xmath10 with vertical polarization as a single peak . at @xmath14",
    "it is visible with horizontal polarization but overlaps with out - of - plane orbitals which makes a parameter assignment difficult .",
    "this means that in polarization independent measurement , such as those in ref .  , the spectral weight assigned to the @xmath33 peak at @xmath10 will have additional contributions besides the pure @xmath33 orbital ( of roughly one third of the total intensity as seen in fig .",
    "6c ) . as a consequence , the experimental estimate of the spectral weight of the zhang - rice singlet part , which was performed there using the intensity of the @xmath33 feature as a calibration , should be increased by 50 per cent .    * dispersion relations . * analyzing the dispersion relations we observe a difference beween the copper bands which couple strongly to the antiferromagnetic spin structure and thus feel the antiferromagnetic bz and the nonbonding oxygen bands which are decoupled from the spin system and follow the paramagnetic ( or ferromagnetic ) bz .",
    "to take that effect into account for sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 we should extend our theory twice .",
    "first we should incorporate the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "then all the bands are defined within the afm bz . to obtain in such a scheme",
    "the observed difference between @xmath1 and @xmath10 deserves the calculation of matrix elements .    despite the fact that the experimental order of energy levels can be explained by an lda+u calculation one should be aware that the agreement between photoemission and lda+u can not be perfect .",
    "first of all , the lda+u calculation can not reproduce the satellite structure present in the spectra at about 14 ev binding energy . and second , the lda+u has the tendency to push the copper levels to too large binding energy .",
    "that was visible in our analysis especially at @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath13-integrated copper density of states can also be measured by x - ray photoemission with large photon energy such that the copper cross section dominates that of oxygen . @xcite",
    "it was found that the x - ray photoemission spectrum of the valence band of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 showed the existence of cu 3@xmath6 electron removal states over an energy range of some 5 - 6 ev . to compare our lda+u calculation with earlier ones for la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 @xcite",
    ", one should also keep in mind that we had to choose a rather small shift of the copper levels to find agreement with the experimental situation , and we did not choose correlation parameters from a constrained density functional calculation as in ref .  .",
    "it can be expected that the consideration of self - energy corrections as was done recently by calculating the three - body scattering contributions @xcite improves the situation and allows one to work with real correlation parameters instead of fitted ones .",
    "our main goal here was the assignment of peaks and not the determination of parameters . to extract parameters from polarization dependent arpes measurements",
    "there are several improvements necessary both from the experimental and the theoretical side of view .",
