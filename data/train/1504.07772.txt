    "one of the reasons why we believe in a model beyond the standard model ( sm ) is the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) in our universe .",
    "the inert doublet model  @xcite is a relatively simple model among the models with the dm . in this model",
    ", it is known that there are two viable dark matter mass regions , 53  gev @xmath2  gev and @xmath3 500  gev  @xcite under the assumption of the thermal relic abundance scenario @xcite .    in the lighter dark matter case ,",
    "the dark matter almost annihilate into @xmath4 as shown in the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation - diagrams ] .",
    "when the dark matter mass is less than half of the higgs boson mass , the annihilation cross section of this process is enhanced due to the higgs resonance , and the amount of the dark matter relic abundance getting smaller than the current observed amount of the dark matter @xcite unless the dm - higgs coupling becomes small .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 should be highly suppressed in the light dark matter mass regime to explain the observed value of the dark matter energy density .",
    "the important consequence of the highly suppressed @xmath5 is the very small spin - independent cross section of the dark matter and the nucleon .",
    "the spin - independent cross section is smaller than @xmath6  @xmath7 for 57  gev @xmath8  gev .",
    "this makes direct search for the dark matter difficult .",
    "it was pointed out that the quantum corrections via the gauge bosons are significant and the spin - independent cross section is enhanced when the cross section at the tree level is very small @xcite . however , the effects from the self - coupling of the inert - doublet and the sign ambiguity of the dm - higgs coupling were not discussed .    in this talk , we revisit the quantum corrections to the spin - independent cross section in the light dark matter mass regime . we take into account all the relevant diagrams and show the spin - independent cross section highly depends on the self - coupling of the inert - doublet and the sign of the dm - higgs coupling .",
    "the inert doublet model includes two scalar fields ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) which are su(2 ) doublets with @xmath11 .",
    "these fields have @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath12 all the other sm fields are unchanged under the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 does not get non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "we identify @xmath9 as the sm higgs field , and @xmath10 as the _ inert _ doublet .",
    "the new particles are two neutral scalar bosons ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and one charged higgs boson ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "all these particles are the components of @xmath10 .",
    "the lightest particle among them is stable due to the @xmath0 symmetry , thus a neutral scalar is a dark matter candidate as long as the charged higgs is not the lightest @xmath0-odd particle .",
    "we can always interchange @xmath13 and @xmath14 by the field redefinition of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore @xmath14 is generally the dark matter candidate . in the following",
    ", we consider the situation that @xmath14 is the lightest @xmath0-odd particle and is the dark matter candidate .",
    "there are five new parameters originated from the higgs potential .",
    "three of them are the masses of the new particles , @xmath16 , one is the dm coupling to the sm higgs boson , @xmath5 , and the other is the self - coupling of the @xmath0 odd particles , @xmath17 .",
    "before discussing the quantum corrections to the spin - independent cross section , we have to revisit the dark matter annihilation cross section with loop corrections , because we determine @xmath5 through the annihilation cross section .",
    "we are interested in the dark matter mass region where the annihilation cross section is dominated by the higgs resonance , thus we consider the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation - diagrams ] .",
    "the cross section is proportional to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the loop correction shown in the right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : annihilation - diagrams ] , and @xmath20 is the counterterm .",
    "the loop correction depends on @xmath21 .",
    "since the dominant contributions to the annihilation cross section come from @xmath22 , we take on - shell renormalization condition , namely @xmath23 .",
    "thus almost all the corrections are absorbed into the counterterm , and we find @xmath24 . as a result , we can still use the @xmath5 determined at the tree level for our purpose .",
    "now @xmath5 is determined from the annihilation cross section .",
    "but what is actually determined is its absolute value .",
    "thus the sign of @xmath5 is still unknown , namely @xmath5 has two solutions , @xmath25 .",
    "this sign ambiguity is not important at the tree level analysis , but it is important for the analysis beyond the tree level , because there are interference terms between the tree diagram and the loop diagrams .",
    "we consider both sign possibilities , namely both positive and negative @xmath5 .",
    "we move to discuss the spin - independent cross section with the loop corrections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec - diagrams ] .",
    "the spin - independent cross section is given as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the nucleon mass , @xmath28 is the reduced mass in the dark matter and nucleon system , @xmath29 is the form factor , and @xmath30 is the loop correction given as @xmath31 the counterterm is already determined by the annihilation cross section .",
    "the momentum transfer in the spin - independent cross section is zero , and different from the annihilation cross section .",
    "thus the total contribution from the vertex correction is @xmath32 .",
    "for the contributions from the box and the gluon diagrams , see ref.@xcite . in the case of @xmath33 , we find the fitting formula for @xmath30 , @xmath34         is not suppressed .",
