    "this has been first shown in the famous book of emden @xcite written at the beginning of the 20th century .",
    "emden s book not only summarized the first four decades of research on the self - gravitating stars initiated by lane in 1870 @xcite , but also introduced one of the first singular cauchy problem as represented by eq .",
    "( [ ef01 ] ) , and moreover stimulated further remarkable studies of a whole generation of renowned astrophysicists and mathematicians , such as eddington @xcite , fowler @xcite , and milne @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for negative values of the parameter @xmath19 there are important applications in the theory of spherical nebulae and clusters @xcite and in the emden - fowler form to more terrestrial areas such as pseudoplastic fluids and large deflections of membranes in mechanics @xcite .",
    "a ` two - parameter ' generalization of the emden equation was introduced and systematically studied by fowler @xcite @xmath20 and is currently known as the emden - fowler equation , while the lane - emden equation is the particular case @xmath21 . by a change of variables ,",
    "the ef equation can be written in the standard , non - adjoint form @xmath22 which is the usual form encountered in the literature .",
    "as for the ` three - parameter ' generalization @xmath23 a similar change of variable reduces it to the standard form @xmath24 which is equivalent to eq .",

    "the thomas - fermi model @xcite for the electrostatic field in the bulk of a heavy atom originates from coulomb - poisson considerations and is expressed by a self - adjoint form of the kind given in eq .",
    "( [ ef04 ] ) although for a non - integer @xmath19 .    in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with the standard form of the ef equation in the form @xmath25 for which we provide a discussion of two important integrable cases corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the self - adjoint form of eq .",
    "( [ ef03c ] ) is obtained by changing the variables according to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which leads to @xmath37    on the other hand , an invariant form of eq .",
    "( [ ef03c ] ) can be obtained using the transformation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , which leads to an ef equation with a different power of the independent variable containing both parameters @xmath40    one can then infer that if @xmath1 eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath41 since it coincides with eq .",
    "( [ ef03c ] ) , while for @xmath2 , the power of @xmath42 is zero .",
    "thus , it does not appear to be a coincidence that in 1984 when rosenau @xcite was interested in the integration of eq .",
    "( [ ef03c ] ) where he provided two algebraic methods of integration when the same conditions between the powers of the variables are satisfied : @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "thus , both cases will be considered in detail for which we will construct integrals of motions and write the parametric solutions using a general formalism .    to proceed with the general solutions for these two classes",
    "first let us assume we have a particular solution @xmath43 of eq .",
    "( [ ef03c ] ) , then we construct a general solution @xmath44 , where @xmath45 must satisfy the ode @xmath46 for both classes the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 turn to be constants .",
