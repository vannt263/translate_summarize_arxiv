    "electron systems are prone to low energy instabilities about the fermi surface .",
    "the most general such instability in the weak - coupling limit is bcs superconductivity  @xcite . formally equivalent to the bcs treatment , but involving solely the spin degrees of freedom ,",
    "is a short - wavelength magnetic modulation known as a spin density wave ( sdw )  @xcite .",
    "further coupling between the charge , spin and the lattice may then yield a charge density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "these instabilities can coexist and compete , with order parameters that evolve exponentially with the interaction strength .",
    "although the relationships among the order parameter and its stand - ins ( transition temperature , energy gap , superfluid density , magnetic moment ) in weak - coupling theory are well established and have been thoroughly tested for thermally - driven transitions  @xcite , there have been few if any direct measurements of the exponential dependence of bcs - like order parameters tuned to a quantum critical point at zero temperature .",
    "this is particularly important in light of the role played by underlying quantum phase transitions in materials of fundamental interest and potential technological import such as rare earth cuprates exhibiting high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite , manganites displaying colossal magnetoresistance  @xcite , and transition metal oxides with coupled spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom at the metal - insulator transition  @xcite . in each of these cases ,",
    "the physics involves strong local fluctuations , seemingly at odds with a weak - coupling approach . yet , the demarcation between weak and strong coupling is not clean cut .",
    "it is possible to observe simultaneously seemingly contradictory phenomena in many of these compounds : sliding charge density waves and pseudogaps in the canonical cdw system , the blue bronzes  @xcite ; spin fluctuations with energies of electron volts and long - coherence - length sdw modulation in the simple elemental antiferromagnet , cr ( ref .  ) ; stripe order on nanometer scales and extended charge density waves in the poster child for local charge fluctuations , the lanthanum manganites  @xcite .        in this paper , we use hydrostatic pressure to destroy the itinerant antiferromagnetic order in pure chromium metal , providing the clearest demonstration to date of an ordered ground state with an exponentially - tuned ( bcs - like ) order parameter .",
    "a membrane - operated diamond anvil cell held just above liquid helium temperature provides the tuning mechanism , and permits _ in situ _ measurements of the sdw and cdw order parameters via synchrotron x - ray scattering at the advanced photon source . by pushing the system close to its quantum phase transition",
    ", we identify the microscopic terms which couple applied pressure to the ordered magnetic moment . a detailed study of the effects of applied pressure and chemical doping on the magnetic order reveals stark differences between these two means of driving a quantum phase transition .",
    "by comparing high temperature transport data for cr and @xmath0 to results for other systems which are typically classified as strongly coupled , namely the stripe - phase manganites and charge - density - wave blue bronzes , we probe the distinction between strong and weak coupling of itinerant electrons and suggest that a hierarchy of energy scales can account for the apparent blurring of these conventional designations .",
    "the proximity of our exponentially tuned system to a magnetic instability at high pressure and low temperature highlights the nature of quantum phase transitions for a ground state with no allowed mean - field transition .",
    "our results both confirm some and challenge other long - standing notions on the nature of electronic interactions and instabilities on the fermi surface .",
    "chromium is a 3__d _ _ transition metal with a bcc crystal lattice that has been extensively studied for over forty years as the canonical spin - density - wave system  @xcite .",
    "its elemental nature relieves complications due to composition which often plague studies of quantum magnetism in other systems and the simple bcc lattice , which undergoes no known structural transition with either pressure or light chemical doping , makes it particularly accessible to conceptual treatment .",
    "the itinerant sdw in cr is stabilized by two nested sheets of fermi surface , which are eliminated in the magnetic phase by the formation of an exchange - split energy gap  @xcite .",
    "the nesting feature of the paramagnetic fermi surface , which has been studied by numerical calculation  @xcite and confirmed by photoemission experiments  @xcite , results in a quasi - one - dimensional dispersion relation for the magnetic bands in this three - dimensional metal .",
    "the sdw is modulated by a wavevector @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the lattice constant ) , which is selected by the nesting condition and is slightly incommensurate with the crystal lattice .",
    "@xmath1 may lie with equal probability along any of the three cubic axes , leading to q - domains .",

    "the sdw in cr is accompanied by an itinerant cdw , which is modulated by @xmath7 and is usually thought of as the second harmonic of the sdw  @xcite .",
    "this harmonic relationship between spin and charge is consistent with the @xmath8 scaling ( where @xmath9 is scattering intensity ) , observed both as a function of temperature  @xcite and pressure  @xcite .",

    "the nel transition temperature is suppressed towards zero by applied hydrostatic pressure  @xcite and/or by sufficient doping with chromium s neighbors in the periodic table  @xcite ( for electron - poor v the critical doping is @xmath13 ) . by choosing pressure as our means of suppressing the antiferromagnetic state we avoid the effects of disorder and variable electron count that complicate the interpretation of phase transitions driven by chemical doping .",
    "in fact , a comparison of these two routes to quantum criticality in cr illustrates substantial differences in the response of the system to pressure and to doping  @xcite . by directly measuring the spin and charge order parameters as a function of pressure we hope to demonstrate the behavior of this itinerant magnet on a microscopic level , with results that are straightforward to interpret and have the broadest possible relevance to other systems of itinerant electrons with interactions on the fermi surface .",

    "the sdw and cdw bragg peaks appear as satellites around the forbidden and allowed bcc lattice peaks , respectively . the exponential suppression of the already weak sdw and cdw signals places stringent requirements on the sample quality and instrument collimation .",

    "other work identifies the charge ordering transition at @xmath165 as a peierls transition , and evidence has been seen for sliding cdw conductivity  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the surprising identification of a pseudogap in the canonical sliding cdw system , the blue bronzes  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig_resistivity ] the convergence of strong and weak coupling paradigms with high temperature resistivity data for @xmath0 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 . in @xmath0 the large excess resistivity below @xmath76 results from a loss of carriers due to the gapped fermi surface in the sdw phase , while the small excess resistivity seen above @xmath76 ( ref .  ) suggests the presence of fluctuations associated with incipient magnetic order .",
    "many of the effects associated with fluctuations and reduced effective dimensionality should be less visible to probes with insufficient reciprocal space resolution , such as transport , which are ` shorted - out ' by the non - magnetic bands .",
    "it is therefore noteworthy that such effects are observed in the high temperature resistivity of @xmath0 . in @xmath166 ,",
    "the significant excess resistivity in the range @xmath168 shows the influence of a strong pseudogap on transport , and the energy scale @xmath169 speaks to the strongly correlated nature of the manganites .",
    "nevertheless , below @xmath165 the @xmath166 , @xmath164 series enters into a cdw state for which the bcs - like description should be applicable and where , in fact , the evolution of the energy gap below @xmath165 obeys the mean - field form for @xmath170 ( ref .  ) .",
    "analogous behavior is seen in quasi - one - dimensional cdw systems such as the blue bronzes , @xmath167 ( ref .  ) , for which fluctuations dominate over a large temperature range @xmath171 . here",
    "@xmath172 is the predicted mean - field transition temperature for the one - dimensional electron gas and @xmath173 is the observed long - range ordering temperature .",
    "further evidence for an interesting high - temperature regime in cr comes from considering the relative energy scales @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "bcs theory predicts @xmath176 .",
    "although this relationship is altered for cr by the fact that multiple bands are involved and the appropriate relationship is given instead by eq .",
    "[ eqn_bcs2 ] , the fermi velocities of the two magnetic bands differ by only @xmath177 ( ref .  ) and the theoretical correction to the bcs value of 3.5 is less than 1% .",
    "experimentally , however , optical measurements  @xcite of a series @xmath178 , @xmath179 including pure cr have shown @xmath180 .",
    "this suppression of the long - range ordering temperature below the value expected from mean - field theory points to the effect of fluctuations , and is consistent with the mismatch between the larger energy scales present in the system ( such as the calculated @xmath132 ) and the observed @xmath76 .",
    "we are led to apparent contradictions between observed weak - coupling ground states and signatures of strongly coupled electrons .",
    "the existence of very different energy scales , even for a fairly weak coupling model , helps to resolve the paradox . in the weak - coupling formula ,",
    "the gap scale is still set by the ( large ) fermi energy multiplied by a small weak - coupling factor : @xmath181 . in a pure bcs theory ,",
    "the thermal transition would be produced solely by particle - hole fluctuations across the gap , which gives rise to the canonical relation @xmath182 .",
    "such a picture neglects the collective modes ( spin - waves , or phase modes , and in a coupled system like cr spin - phonon modes ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] . in a model with purely electronic interactions ,",
    "the spin - wave velocity is steep ( canonically @xmath183 ) , thus entering the particle - hole continuum at a wave - vector corresponding to the inverse of the coherence length @xmath184 , which is much smaller than an inverse lattice constant . with a dispersion that is so steep ,",
    "the thermal occupation of these modes contributes little to the free energy at low temperatures .",
    "schematic dispersion relation for an itinerant electron system exhibiting an enhanced susceptibility at wavevector @xmath1 , leading to a low - temperature bcs - like ground state .",
    "the canonical spin wave dispersion ( solid line ) is steep and these modes contribute little to the free energy in the ordered state .",
    "the enhanced susceptibility at @xmath1 leads to collective slow modes ( dashed line ) around this point , an effect which is enhanced by coupling of the spin to the charge and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the population of these collective modes with energy below the single - particle excitation gap @xmath185 drives the thermal phase transition ; above @xmath186 pseudogaps remain and @xmath187 is larger than the canonical bcs value of 3.5 . ]    however , at larger momenta , the spectral weight in the collective modes lies on the scale of the interaction strength @xmath127 ( here @xmath188 ) , which is much _",
    "softer _ than the weak coupling theory allows .",
    "furthermore , in a system with substantial magneto - phonon coupling ( as evidenced here by the cdw ) , this spectral weight mixes with phonons on a characteristic scale of the debye frequency ; these slow modes have frequencies usually well within the gap , set by pinning and the phonon mass .",
    "unless the cdw / sdw gap is truly tiny , it is usually the case that the population of these short - wavelength modes will drive the phase transition ; above @xmath186 pseudogaps remain and @xmath187 is large .",
    "this picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] ) is generic and can be applied equally well to cdw and sdw systems ; charged superconductors themselves are special because long - range coulomb forces stiffen the phase mode into the conventional plasmon .    by juxtaposing unambiguous proof of a weak - coupling ground state with signatures of incipient magnetic order at high temperature",
    "we have argued that the nel transition in cr differs from the expectations of mean - field theory , and that the distinction between strongly and weakly coupled systems of itinerant electrons should be significantly blurred . at sufficiently high pressure and low temperature , quantum fluctuations will cut off the decades long exponential evolution of the sdw and cdw order parameters , and pose new questions about the relationships between spin and charge order and the relevant energy scales .",
