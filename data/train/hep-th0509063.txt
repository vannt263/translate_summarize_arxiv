    "until recently , the calculation of cross sections for the production of many particles ( quarks , gluons , photons , etc . ) in high - energy collisions has been restricted by the technical difficulties associated with the evaluation of the corresponding multiparticle feynman diagrams .",
    "significant progress has been made in the past year with the development of new techniques , principally the ` mhv rules ' introduced by cachazo , svrcek and witten ( csw ) @xcite and the britto - cachazo - feng ( bcf ) @xcite recursion relations , in which amplitudes are constructed from a new set of building blocks  maximum helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes  which themselves represent groups of feynman diagrams corresponding to particular external helicity configurations .",
    "in contrast to the usual approach , the amplitudes are expressed in terms of positive and negative chirality _ spinors _ ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and their corresponding products .",
    "the mhv amplitudes have very simple expressions in terms of these spinor products , which replace the usual scalar products @xmath4 as the means by which the scattering amplitudes depend on the external particle four - momenta .",
    "although first used to calculate tree amplitudes , these techniques have since been successfully applied at 1-loop @xcite .",
    "so far , the focus of attention has been on developing and exploiting techniques for qcd scattering processes , for example @xmath5 , @xmath6 etc .",
    ", since such amplitudes are needed to estimate multi - jet cross sections at hadron colliders .",
    "indeed , the mhv rules @xcite were specifically developed for and applicable to massless yang - mills field theory .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether similar techniques exist for abelian field theories , in particular qed .",
    "we choose as our test - bed process the simplest qed tree - level multiparticle scattering process , @xmath7 .. ]    in fact the @xmath7 process was already studied @xcite almost twenty years ago at a time when ` spinor techniques ' for scattering amplitudes were being developed .",
    "the process was used to illustrate the power of these new techniques ; extremely compact expressions were obtained for the production of arbitrary numbers of photons , even taking the non - zero electron mass into account .",
    "we will refer to this as the ks approach .",
    "the expressions were specifically designed to allow for efficient numerical computation of the amplitudes , and indeed the only limitation on the size of @xmath8 was due to the available computing power at the time .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see whether the more modern mhv - based techniques can improve on the calculational efficiency of the original ks expressions .",
    "this can be measured , for example , by the compactness of the algebraic expressions and by the time taken to evaluate the spin - summed amplitude squared for one ` event ' corresponding to a random point in phase space .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarise the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the ( massless ) @xmath7 scattering ampplitude .",
    "we then repeat the calculation using the qed - generalised version of the mhv technique , both in the original mhv - rules and recursive ( bcf ) approaches .",
    "consider the process e^-(p_a ) + e^+(p_b ) ( k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + ... + ( k_n ) in the massless ( electron ) limit , helicity is conserved at each fermion - photon vertex and so the helicities of the electron and positron will be opposite , @xmath10 .",
    "there are therefore @xmath11 distinct spin amplitudes ( two polarisations for each photon and @xmath12 ) . in the traditional approach , the ( @xmath13 ) feynman diagrams are obtained simply by joining the @xmath8 photons to the fermion line in all possible ways . labelling the distinct polarisation states by @xmath14",
    "gives an expression for the unpolarised cross section of d _",
    "n =    _ s | m_s |^2 where the terms on the right - hand side are the flux factor , the phase space volume element , the symmetry factor and the spin - summed / averaged amplitude squared respectively .",
    "the ks result is .",
    "the corresponding @xmath15 amplitudes are readily obtained using parity invariance . ]",
    "@xcite m_s & = & e^n ( _ j=1^n p k_j ) ^-1/2 _ d=1^n !",

    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 $ ] spinor products that appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks1 ] ) are defined in appendix a. the full expression for the amplitude for arbitrary @xmath8 can then be written in just a few lines of computer code .",
    "note that the result for the amplitude squared is independent of @xmath16 ( which is related to the choice of photon gauge ) and this provides a powerful check on the calculational procedure .",
    "particular helicity amplitudes in yang - mills theory take on unexpectedly simple forms .",
    "this is despite the considerable computational effort involved in their calculation via the standard feynman diagram approach .",
    "long expressions involving many terms often simplify to a single term , or even vanish . at tree level for example ,",
    "purely gluonic colour - ordered scattering amplitudes can be summarized as follows : are defined in appendix  a. ] @xmath22 so amplitudes with all the gluons having the same helicity vanish , as do those with only one gluon having a different helicity to the others .",
    "the third case above therefore corresponds to maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes .",
    "their simple form was first conjectured by parke and taylor @xcite , and later proven by berends and giele @xcite using a recursive technique .",
    "note that @xmath23 above is called a ` mostly plus ' mhv amplitude , for obvious reasons .",
    "its ` mostly minus ' counterpart , which has two positive helicities and the remainder negative , is called an @xmath21 amplitude , and can be obtained simply by interchanging @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the main difference when we consider qed is that there are no pure - photon tree - level amplitudes .",
    "there must always be ( at least ) one pair of fermions present , which must be of opposite helicity due to our convention that all particles are incoming .",
    "also , in contrast to non - abelian theories there is no concept of colour ordering , so we will be concerned with full physical amplitudes rather than colour - ordered partial amplitudes .",
    "it is again the case that amplitudes with only one negative helicity particle ( which must be either the fermion or anti - fermion  we shall take it to be the former ) vanish , @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes a positive helicity photon with momentum @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 denote fermion and anti - fermion respectively .",
    "the mhv amplitudes take the following form ( for massless fermions ) : @xmath30 this is the fundamental mhv amplitude in qed , and as before it consists of only a single term .",
    "the factor @xmath31 is the gauge coupling constant , which we will normally omit in what follows .",
    "it is possible @xcite to obtain the amplitude in ( [ qedmhv ] ) by symmetrizing colour - ordered non - abelian amplitudes , @xmath32 each term on the right - hand side is a colour - ordered mhv ( parke - taylor ) qcd amplitude , and we sum over @xmath13 permutations of @xmath8 gluons .",
    "a factor of @xmath33 must also be included to take account of different generator normalizations  our qed generators are normalized to @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that in writing ( [ qedmhv ] ) in this particular way we have made an apparently arbitrary choice of phase . since the phase of a full ( i.e. not partial ) amplitude is not a physical observable , any of the @xmath35 products in ( [ qedmhv ] ) could , naively , be replaced with the corresponding @xmath36 $ ] product .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "it is worth mentioning that due to parity invariance the amplitude with all the helicities flipped has the same magnitude as ( [ qedmhv ] ) above .",
    "also , one can use charge conjugation invariance to switch the fermion and anti - fermion .",
    "we can write ( [ qedmhv ] ) in a physically more illuminating way , emphasizing the pole structure : @xmath37 it is a fundamental result of general quantum field theories that scattering amplitudes have a universal behaviour in the soft ( gauge boson ) limit . when all components of a particular photon s momentum are taken to zero , the amplitude factorizes into the amplitude in the absence of that photon multiplied by an ` eikonal factor ' , @xmath38 the form of this factor is universal .",
    "since the qed mhv amplitude is just a single term , it follows that the eikonal factors must be present as factors  and indeed they are .",
    "there has been much recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes in perturbative yang - mills theory .",
    "cazacho , svrcek and witten @xcite introduced a novel diagrammatic technique , known as the ` mhv rules ' , in which maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes are used as vertices in a scalar perturbation theory .",
    "these vertices are connected by scalar propagators @xmath39 .",
    "this arrangement vastly reduces the number of diagrams that must be evaluated relative to the traditional feynman rules case .",
    "although the original csw paper dealt only with purely gluonic amplitudes , the formalism has been successfully extended to include quarks @xcite , higgs @xcite and massive gauge bosons @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use ( [ qedmhv ] ) to apply the mhv rules to qed processes , and derive relatively simple formulae for four and five photon amplitudes ( an electron and positron are understood to be present also ) .    in order to use mhv amplitudes as vertices ,",
    "it is necessary to continue them off - shell , since internal momenta will not be light - like . we need to define spinors @xmath2 for the internal lines .",
    "the convention established in @xcite , which we shall follow , defines @xmath2 to be @xmath40 for an internal line of momentum @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is arbitrary .",
    "the same @xmath43 must be used for all internal lines and in all diagrams contributing to a particular amplitude . in practice",
    ", it proves convenient to choose @xmath43 to be one of the conjugate ( opposite chirality ) spinors @xmath44 of the external fermion legs . note that for external lines , which remain on - shell , @xmath2 is defined in the usual way ( see appendix a ) .",
    "having defined the mhv amplitudes , and the manner in which they are to be continued off - shell , we are now in a position to calculate non - mhv amplitudes .",
    "these are simply those with more than two negative - helicity particles .      as a first example",
    "let us calculate @xmath45 .",
    "( not @xmath28 ) and the spinor representing the anti - fermion is now denoted @xmath34 ( not @xmath46 ) . also , for clarity we will now omit the coupling constants .",
    "] this is expected to vanish , see ( [ eq : qedvanish ] ) .",
    "there are two contributing mhv diagrams , though they differ only by a permutation of photons .",
    "note that the external legs are not constrained to be positioned cyclically as in the case of colour - ordered partial amplitudes .",
    "the absence of a pure - photon vertex means that the internal lines of mhv diagrams for qed processes with two fermions can only be fermionic .",
    "the contribution of the diagram in figure 1 can be written down immediately as    .",
    "fermion lines are dashed , photon lines are solid .",
    "all particles are incoming .",
    "there is also a similar diagram with photons 3 and 4 interchanged . ]",
    "@xmath47    where @xmath48 is the spinor representing the internal line of momentum @xmath49 .",

    "we are left with two terms which , after again invoking momentum conservation , simplify to @xmath64 [ 1 \\ 5]^3 [ 2 \\ 5]}{\\prod_{k=3}^5 [ 1 \\ k ] [ 2 \\ k ] } \\ ; .\\ ] ] inspection of the corresponding mhv amplitude ( [ qedmhv ] ) shows that this result has the correct magnitude . having made a particular choice of phase for the mhv amplitudes in ( [ qedmhv ] ) , a definite phase emerges for their @xmath21 counterparts .",

    "they contain only @xmath65 products .",
    "the latter emerge as anti - holomorphic , consisting only of @xmath36 $ ] products .",
    "colour - ordered partial amplitudes also have this property .",
    "here however , we are dealing with a physical amplitude , and so the phase is not a measurable quantity .",
    "it is interesting to note that choosing the mhv amplitudes to have different phases , for instance an expression containing a mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath66 , does _ not _ in general lead to correct results for non - mhv amplitudes .",
    "this is to be expected , as it is only those amplitudes which , apart from the momentum - conserving delta function , are comprised entirely of @xmath65 products that transform simply onto a line in twistor space @xcite .",
    "the first non - zero nmhv amplitudes appear for @xmath68 photons , when two photons have helicity @xmath69 and two have helicity @xmath70 .",
    "there are eight diagrams for this process but only three distinct structures , so that we need only work out three diagrams and obtain the others by permuting photons .",

    "we define two types of spinor product : @xmath105 and @xmath106 = \\epsilon_{\\dot{a}\\dot{b } } \\tilde\\lambda^{\\dot{a } } \\tilde\\lambda^{\\dot{b } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] if we have two null 4-vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 then @xmath109 \\ ; .\\ ] ] for clarity , we will usually abbreviate the notation by writing the spinor products as @xmath110 & = & [ i \\ j ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] also , it is useful to define @xmath111 = \\langle i \\",

    "we take all particles to be incoming so that , in an @xmath8 particle process , @xmath112 and @xmath113 = 0\\ ] ] for all @xmath114 .    in practical applications",
    "the spinor product @xmath115 can be conveniently represented in terms of the 4-momenta components @xcite , @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "the square bracket @xmath118 $ ] product is then defined using eq .",
    "( [ spinordef ] ) . for a thorough review of the spinor helicity formalism",
    ", the reader is directed to refs .",
    "an elegant proof of the relations proposed in @xcite was presented in @xcite . here",
    "we will briefly sketch its main elements , before discussing its applicability to qed .",
    "* choose two particles for special treatment , which we can take to be the @xmath120-th and @xmath121-th particles with helicities @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively , and introduce a complex variable @xmath124 to rewrite their momenta as @xmath125 we have effectively shifted the spinors @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "note that there is no symmetry between @xmath120 and @xmath121  they are treated differently .",
    "having done this we can now construct the auxiliary function @xmath128 the aim now is to use the analytic structure of this auxiliary function , considered as a function of @xmath124 .",
    "* @xmath129 has only simple poles .",
    "this can be argued by noting that poles only arise from propagators @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the momenta of the internal line .",
    "if both @xmath132 and @xmath133 , or neither of them , are present in the sum of external momenta contributing to @xmath131 then the latter is independent of @xmath124 and there is no @xmath124-pole in the propagator . however , if only one and not the other is present then the momenta of the internal line is linearly dependent on @xmath124 , and so is the propagator .",
    "thus @xmath129 has only simple poles .",
    "* cauchy s theorem tells us that @xmath134 so that the physical amplitude @xmath135 is fully determined by the finite pole positions @xmath136 and residues of the auxiliary function , provided @xmath129 vanishes at infinity .",
    "the finite residues are just products of lower-@xmath8 tree amplitudes , with feynman propagators in between .",
    "the recursion relation then follows immediately .    to demonstrate the vanishing of @xmath129 as @xmath137",
    ", one may use the mhv rules outlined in @xcite .",
    "it suffices to show that the mhv amplitudes themselves vanish in this limit since , as shown in @xcite , the off - shell continuation does not affect the large @xmath124 behaviour of a general mhv diagram .",
    "it turns out that some choices of reference lines are allowed ( i.e. lead to an auxiliary function that vanishes at infinity ) , whilst others are not .",
    "we can formulate some rules to determine the allowed choices .",
    "this is useful because , as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found , the number of bcf diagrams contributing to a given amplitude depends strongly on the reference lines chosen .",
    "a careful choice can save much labour , and yield more compact expressions .",
    "first , let us repeat ( [ qedmhv ] ) for convenience , @xmath138 and also its @xmath21 counterpart @xmath139^{n-2 } [ \\overline{f } i ] ^3 [ f i]}{\\prod_{i=1}^n [ f i ] [ \\overline{f } i]}\\ ; .\\ ] ] the mhv rules can be employed using either solely mhv or solely @xmath21 amplitudes .",
    "if we choose @xmath121 to be a positive helicity photon , and consider ( [ qedmhv2 ] ) then it is clear that the amplitude vanishes at infinity since there are more factors of @xmath124 in the denominator than in the numerator .",
    "this is true regardless is either the fermion or antifermion , then @xmath129 vanishes as @xmath140 whereas if @xmath120 is another photon then @xmath129 vanishes as @xmath141 .",
    "] of the identity of @xmath120 . similarly if we choose @xmath120 to be a negative helicity photon , and consider ( [ mhvbar ] ) then once again @xmath129 vanishes at infinity , regardless of our choice of @xmath121 .",
    "so in both these cases , which cover a large subset of the possible choices , the recursion relations will work .",
    "the positive helicity anti - fermion may be used at the lower vertex provided the fermion is not used at the upper vertex , as in this case the mhv amplitude does not vanish as @xmath142 .",
    "it is also possible @xcite to see the analytic structure of an amplitude by considering the set of feynman diagrams that contribute to it . for @xmath7",
    "there are @xmath13 diagrams , differing only in the order in which the photons are attached to the fermion line .",
    "the @xmath124-dependence of the diagram can only come from propagators ( which either contribute a factor @xmath140 or are independent of @xmath124 ) and photon polarization vectors . ]",
    "which , in the spinor helicity formalism , take the general form ^-_a = , ^+_a = for negative and positive helicity photons respectively . here",
    "@xmath143 and @xmath144 are reference spinors . recall that we shift the spinors representing the momenta of the @xmath121-th and @xmath120-th legs as _ l & & _",
    "l + z_k + _ k & & _ k - z_l so that the polarization vector of the @xmath120-th photon behaves as @xmath140 if it has negative helicity and linearly in @xmath124 if it has positive helicity .",
    "the opposite holds for the @xmath121-th photon . by looking at the most dangerous feynman graphs we can deduce that choosing @xmath145 or @xmath146",
    "is always allowed , which verifies what we saw above using mhv diagrams .",
