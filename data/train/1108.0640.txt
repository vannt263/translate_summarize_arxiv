    "applications of polymer gels range from traditional thickeners for paint @xcite to novel precision gels for medical applications @xcite . in all cases",
    ", their ability to form reversible cross - links plays a crucial role since it allows the system to remodel the internal structure under the application of external stresses .",
    "often these gels consist of triblock copolymers , containing a long hydrophilic spacer and short hydrophobic end groups @xcite . in an aqueous solution ,",
    "these end groups aggregate . at high enough concentrations , aggregates form junction points in a gel network . at lower concentrations , the hydrophobic",
    "groups still aggregate , but separate micelles form .",
    "the sol - gel transition characterizes the cross - over from fluid like to solid like behavior . besides concentration changes both lowering the temperature or the application of external stress",
    "can also induce such a cross - over .",
    "a unique feature of the material is that the junction points are not permanent , instead the aggregate size - as well as its location - changes over time .    understanding the structure of the gel network as well as its dynamics due to formation and breakup of aggregating end blocks is crucial to the development of optimal designed materials . to this end , we have constructed a computer simulation of a toy system of associating telechelic polymers , in which end groups can form aggregates .",
    "each polymer chain , 8 units in length , is modeled as a bead - spring chain molecule @xcite . by means of a monte carlo step , we allow a chain end group to bind chemically with another end and",
    "hence form reversible junctions .",
    "aggregates contain end groups that are connected to each other by these junctions .",
    "their size varies and is set by many factors , such as the diffusion rate , the temperature of the system , and steric constraints due to the connection of each end group to a chain molecule . in previous work , we have calculated the aggregate size distribution for a range of temperatures @xcite and characterized the sol - gel transition .",
    "moreover , we studied the network topology in detail using graph theoretical concepts @xcite . in this work",
    ", we report on the kinetics of the aggregation process and analyze the results in terms of the reaction rates in the master equations .",
    "several other groups have studied the sol - gel transition by means of computer simulations . however , as far as we are aware , all of them have concentrated on the changes in structural properties instead of the kinetics underlying the reversible aggregation processes . for instance bedrov _ et .",
    "@xcite performed simulations in which chain end groups were given a greater affinity to each other than to all other groups .",
    "they find similar aggregate size distributions as in our work , however since there are no specific interactions that bind end groups together , reaction rates can not be determined in this model .",
    "the same is true for a recent study by pandmanabhan _ et .",
    "in which they investigate semi flexible polymer gels @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we give the background of the simulation model , which is followed by a discussion of the master equations and reaction rates in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ] , we report on the measured rates and show that they are consistent with the aggregate distributions .",
    "section [ sec5 ] discusses how changes with temperature in the reaction rates are related to those in the overall dynamics of the systems that characterize the sol - gel transition .",
    "this is followed by a conclusion in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we employ a hybrid molecular dynamic ( md ) / monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of telechelic polymers .",
    "the simulation uses a course - grained model introduced by kremer and grest @xcite .",
    "polymers are modeled as a string of beads .",
    "beads interact with each other through a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath0,\\ ] ] for @xmath1 and zero otherwise . to speed up the calculations",
    "the cut - off distance was taken to be @xmath2 and hence only the repulsive component of the potential is contributing .",
    "beads connected by the chain structure are bonded through an anharmonic finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xmath3,\\ ] ] for @xmath4 and infinite otherwise .",
    "the parameters used were @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it has been observed within the simulations @xcite that the average length of a fene bond is @xmath7 and that the chains can not cross through each other .",
    "the positions of the beads are updated in md simulations by integrating the equations of motion using a 5th - order gear predictor - corrector algorithm with a time step of @xmath8 .",
    "length , energy , and time are expressed in terms of the parameters ( @xmath9 ) of the lj potential .",
    "the simulation system is comprised of 1000 telechelic polymer chains , each chain being eight beads in length .",
    "the simulation cell has dimensions @xmath10 and hence the density is far below that at which the system turns glassy due to caging effects @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are employed in the first two directions , while solid surfaces confine the simulation in the third direction .",
    "the beads at the chain ends are functionalized linkers and can form reversible junctions with multiple other end groups .",
    "formation and breaking of junctions takes place through mc moves @xcite .",
    "junctions are modeled by a fene potential with the same parameters as described earlier , to which a constant negative constant @xmath11 is added .",
    "every @xmath12 , an attempt is made to form and break junctions between all end groups . for the probability of a formation success",
    "a metropolis algorithm is used which depends upon a boltzmann factor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy difference between the old and the potentially new state .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath11 affects the overall dynamics within the simulation and hence the temperature at which gelation occurs . as in previous work @xcite",
    ", we choose @xmath15 , which implies that the micelle transition temperature is @xmath16 .",
    "note that this algorithm employs a simplification of neglecting the energy barrier @xmath17 , between the bonded and the unbonded states , that is present in an experimental system .",
    "it assumes a two - state system in which chain ends are either bound or unbound . as has been pointed out by hoy _",
    "@xcite , the effect of @xmath17 would have been to slow down the rate of formation and breakage of individual junctions by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "however the equilibrium constant , defined as the ratio of these rates , is independent of barrier height .",
    "hence equilibrium properties such as aggregate size distributions are not influenced by our simplification .",
    "it should be kept in mind that all rates at which aggregates form or break , reported later in this paper , are dependent on the chosen form of the interaction potential between the chain end groups ( a simple fene bond to which a constant negative association energy is added ) .",
    "they are also dependent on the fact that we attempt to break and from junctions every @xmath19 . in this study",
    "we take these settings as given and aim to relate the structural changes observed when cooling the system to measured changes in formation and breaking rates . since most of our results depend only on the values of the ratio of rates and hence are independent of the barrier , we believe this study to be relevant to experimental systems as well .    finally we emphasize , that in our model there is no limitation to the number of junctions that an end group can form , hence detailed balance is observed within our work .",
    "@xcite adapted the model to perform a study involving only binary interactions , and therefore in that case strict detailed balance was lost .",
    "the simulation is analyzed through a range of temperatures by thermally cooling from an initially high temperature .",
    "the temperature is controlled by coupling the simulation cell to a heat bath according to the fluctuation dissipation theorem as described by kremer _ et .",
    "_ @xcite . at each desired temperature",
    ", the system is allowed to equilibrate for at least @xmath20 prior to acquiring data .",
    "the spatial locations of each bead within the system , along with end group junction data is then gathered for a number of time steps necessary achieve statistically consistent results .",
    "data at lower temperatures are obtained starting from a well - equilibrated configuration at @xmath21 . at this temperature ,",
    "the system is first run with @xmath22 , so no junctions form . given that each chain is only eight beads long , equilibrium is reached quickly .",
    "junctions between chain ends are then introduced and the system is equilibrated until the number of junctions and the size distribution of the clusters of end groups fluctuates around its equilibrium value .",
    "the system is then slowly cooled at a rate of @xmath23 per @xmath24 , in order to reach the desired temperatures .",
    "data obtained by cooling the system from different initial states at @xmath21 are observed to be identical within statistical fluctuations .    at the temperatures considered in this",
    "study the system is quite mobile .",
    "for instance the diffusion rate of aggregates equals @xmath25 at @xmath26 and approximately @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "a single junction has an average lifetime of approximately @xmath29 at @xmath26 .",
    "the reported data have been obtained from runs that are at least ten times the inverse diffusion rate of the system ; hence the system samples many different configurations during this computer experiment .",
    "the aggregate size distribution is displayed in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "@xmath30 is the probability of finding an end group in an aggregate of size @xmath31 , where an aggregate contains only end groups that are connected to each other through the reversible junctions .",
    "it is calculated as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average number of aggregates of size @xmath31 and is obtained from the simulation data .",
    "@xmath34 , the average total number of aggregates , depends on the temperature .     of the polymer system for a range of temperatures.[fig1 ] ]    at high temperatures @xmath30 decreases monotonically with increasing cluster size .",
    "however , at @xmath35 a shoulder has formed , which develops in a pronounced peak at lower temperatures .",
    "the temperature at which the shoulder first forms ( approximately @xmath36 ) is called the onset temperature @xcite . at this temperature",
    "the properties of the system first start to deviate from those of an ordinary liquid .",
    "for instance , we have shown in previous work @xcite that below this temperature the dependence of the relaxation time on temperature is not any longer arrhenius .",
    "when cooled even further the system undergoes a micelle transition .",
    "the total number of junctions between end beads @xmath37 grows sharply and as a result a finite preferred aggregate size exists below the micelle transition . at this point ,",
    "the distribution @xmath30 exhibits a distinct peak .",
    "the micelle transition temperature is defined as the point at which @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the specific heat peaks as well . for the system at hand , we have calculated @xcite that the micelle transition temperature @xmath39 .",
    "the micelle transition is an equilibrium transition in the systems structural properties .",
    "in addition at the gel transition the system becomes dynamically arrested due to the long times that the end groups reside within specific aggregates .",
    "this nonequilibrium transition in the dynamics of the system occurs in our simulations at @xmath40 .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate by how far these transitions in the properties of a gel forming system can be explained by the reaction rates at which aggregates of end groups combine and break up .",
    "reversible aggregation processes can be described as two competing effects : particle aggregation and cluster fragmentation .",
    "the traditional starting point @xcite for treating aggregation is a set of equations that describe how the sizes of the aggregated clusters change over time , called the master equations .",
    "these equations contain the rates at which aggregates form and break apart . in our simulations , an aggregate forms",
    "when two smaller aggregates closely approach each other and a new junction between chain end groups connects them .",
    "it breaks apart when all the junctions between two subunits of an aggregate disconnect .    as an example of this process",
    ", we refer to a cartoon describing the breaking of an aggregate . at the center of fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 2]a six end groups ( shown as red beads ) are joined through multiple junctions .",
    "these end groups comprise an aggregate of size six . during the monte carlo step within the simulation ,",
    "the two green junctions are broken , resulting in two aggregates of size three ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 2]b ) .",
    "the number of junctions broken , along with their distribution within the aggregate are determined according to the rules of the metropolis algorithm .",
    "note that aggregation within the system is a reversible process , therefore the time reverse reaction will also occur .    ]",
    "if we denote an aggregate of size @xmath31 by @xmath41 , a change in the size of this aggregate can occur by the following reactions @xmath42{q_f(k,\\ell ) }   ( k ) ,          \\label{eq4}\\\\          ( k + \\ell ) \\xrightleftharpoons[q_f(k+\\ell,\\ell)]{q_b(k+\\ell,\\ell ) }   ( k ) + ( \\ell ) .",

    "[ eq4 ] , @xmath43 is defined as the rate that a given aggregate of size @xmath44 combines with one of size @xmath45 to form an aggregate of size @xmath31 within a time @xmath46 . similarly for the reverse reaction , @xmath47 is defined as the rate that an aggregate of size @xmath31 breaks into an aggregate of size @xmath44 and one of size @xmath45 .",
    "of course an aggregate of size @xmath31 is also formed when an aggregate of size @xmath48 breaks into one of size @xmath31 and one of size @xmath44 .",
    "the reverse reaction destroys an aggregate of size @xmath31 .",
    "[ eq5 ] describes the latter two events .",
    "the master equations describing the aggregation model can be written as @xmath49 here , @xmath33 is the number of aggregates of size @xmath31 .",
    "the master equations represent a system of coupled differential equations .",
    "the model is finite since there are only 2000 end groups in the simulated system . due to steric effects the maximum observed aggregate size",
    "is even smaller .",
    "we never observed aggregates that contained more than approximately 60 end groups .",
    "the rates , at which the reactions according to eq . [ eq4 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] occur , are determined directly from the md simulations .",
    "this is achieved by tracking the frequency of size specific reactions in both @xmath41 and @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , a formation occurrence @xmath51 is defined as an event leading to an incremental change in the number of aggregates of size @xmath31 in a period of time @xmath12 , caused by the combination of an aggregate of size @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the time averaged reaction rates are then determined as the ratio of @xmath51 to the number of aggregates which can produce @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath43 is determined such that , @xmath52 the breaking rate @xmath47 is determined using a similar procedure .",

    "within the determination of the rates , it is assumed that @xmath41 is always greater than @xmath50 .",
    "it is observed that the reaction rates of the polymer system are not only temperature dependent , but are also a function of the size of aggregates involved in the reaction .",
    "the equilibrium constant , defined to be the ratio of the reaction rates @xmath54 , is related to the gibbs free energy of the system and is shown at @xmath26 ( g ) , @xmath53 ( h ) , and @xmath28 ( i ) .",

    "average rates have been smoothed for display purposes.[fig2 ] ]      the aggregate size distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) should result from the master equations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq6 ] ) with the calculated reaction rates shown in fig .",
    "two different methods are used to prove that this is indeed the case .",
    "the first consists of an unconstrained minimization of the master equations . at equilibrium @xmath56 and",

    "two intermediate steps are shown : the blue dotted line after @xmath60 and the green dot - dashed one after @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig3 ] ]    the second method consists of solving the master equations in time . as an initial state",
    ", we take one in which each aggregate with @xmath64 is equally likely and no aggregates with size over 20 exist .",
    "the initial distribution is shown as a dashed red line in fig .",
    "this distribution is then updated by the master equations and the measured rates at @xmath53 ( the dotted blue line shows the distribution after time @xmath60 , and the dot - dashed green line after time @xmath61 ) .",
    "the aggregate distribution converges in approximately @xmath59 to that shown as a solid black line .",
    "as expected , this distribution agrees nicely with the measured aggregate size distribution ( shown as circles ) .",
    "similar agreements were obtained for other initial distributions and other temperatures .",
    "the condition of detailed balance @xcite can be used to show that only the rates of reactions , where one end group joins an aggregate or breaks away from it , completely determine the aggregate distribution .",
    "this condition , if applicable , states that at a steady state the frequency of a specific reaction in the forward direction should be equivalent to that of the reverse reaction",
    ". in our case , that implies @xmath65 for all @xmath41 and @xmath50 , in which @xmath66 .",
    "it would therefore follow that @xmath67 this relationship at equilibrium has been verified within the simulations to hold ( within statistical fluctuations ) for multiple values of @xmath44 , @xmath31 , and @xmath68 .",
    "[ eq9 ] has two implications in regards to the kinetic model .",
    "the first is that the first two terms and the last two terms in eq .",

    "[ eq7 ] adds up to zero for each value of @xmath44 independently . in other words ,",
    "knowledge of @xmath69 is sufficient to calculate the aggregate size distribution by propagating eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] for @xmath70 : @xmath71 n_{k-1}$ ] .",
    "the aggregate distribution @xmath30 can then be obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] . alternatively ,",
    "starting from any initial condition , say the dashed red line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and updating using only the @xmath62 rates should yield the correct aggregate distribution .",
    "this procedure was carried out and indeed yielded the correct distribution , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( triangles ) .",
    "the convergence , however , is approximately a factor of 25 slower than the one attained when all rates are used .",
    "although the @xmath62 rates lead to the same correct distribution , the slow convergence here is due to the fact that they solely allow for a subset of the entire kinetics provided by the model using the complete range of rates .",
    "we make use of the fact that the @xmath62 rates by themselves yield the observed aggregate distribution ( see below ) when we discuss how changes in these reaction rates give rise to the observed changes in the aggregate distribution that characterizes a micelle transition .     of the master equations jacobian matrix , evaluated at the known equilibrium state of the polymer at @xmath53 .",
    "the real eigenvalues are shown as red circles , while complex eigenvalues are shown in black squares .",

    "the rates are undetermined within the simulation time . this procedure results e.g. in @xmath78 for @xmath53 . since reaction rates and the aggregate size distribution are known , the jacobian can be evaluated for a given temperature , and its eigenvalues calculated .",

    "this feature is necessary for the two rates to cross and provides a range of @xmath41 , where in @xmath118 . for these @xmath41 values , it is more favorable for a single end group to join the aggregate than to break from it .",
    "moreover , at low temperatures , the minimum and maximum points in the aggregate size distribution are seen to correspond to the points where @xmath119 .",
    "this is theoretically easily verified .",
    "an extremum in the aggregate distribution implies that @xmath120 or @xmath121 . using eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] can be rewritten as @xmath122 or @xmath123 for every @xmath50 . in particular , when @xmath92 @xmath124 so @xmath125 when @xmath117 . at high temperature @xmath126 for all aggregates of size @xmath31 and",
    "hence the aggregate size distribution has no extreme .",
    "the rates do not cross for @xmath115 and higher , while they do for @xmath35 or lower .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath127 coincides with the temperature where the aggregate size distribution first forms a shoulder .",
    "this is expected since a necessary condition for the appearance of a peak in the aggregate size distribution is that the curves cross .",
    "below @xmath36 , arrhenius dependence of the equilibrium constants and relaxation rates on temperature is lost .",
    "moreover , the area between the @xmath114 and @xmath113 curves , shown in fig [ fig8 ] , first increases and then decreases again when the temperature is lowered from @xmath35 .",
    "the area has an extremum at @xmath116 : the micelle transition temperature .",
    "note that the above observation follows from the fact that both the forming and breaking rates are non monotonic as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "this fact deserves some further explanation .",
    "most importantly , the two rates depend differently on @xmath41 , one being concave up and the other increasing or concave down .",
    "we believe that these differences are due to cooperative effects . in general",
    "a single bead is attached to an aggregate with more than one junction ( see fig . [ fig1 - 2 ] ) . in order for the bead to break away from the aggregate",
    ", multiple junctions have to break .",
    "the junctions have to break in a short time interval , since there is a significant chance that the first junction that broke would reform while the others are still there . on the other hand , when a bead joins an aggregate it is sufficient that one junction forms .",
    "@xmath113 initially decreases with @xmath41 since at small @xmath41 only one junction has to be broken and the need for two or more to be broken increases with @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , the larger the aggregate , the more places there are at which an end group can break off .",
    "hence , at some point the trend reverses and the rate starts to increase with @xmath41 . on the other hand , @xmath128 initially increases with ( k ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that a single bead can attach at more points to the aggregate of size @xmath129 as @xmath41 increases .",
    "for this reason , one would expect @xmath128 to increase monotonically .",
    "this is indeed the case at high temperature .",
    "however at low temperature the rate starts to drop again at large @xmath41 values .",
    "we believe that this is due to the much lower diffusion rate of large aggregates at low temperatures .",

    "[ fig7 ] * ( d ) * through * ( f ) * as function of temperature . [ fig8 ] ]",
    "usually in solution and other dense media one has to check the validity of transition rate theory , since if friction is high , solvent dynamics can not be neglected .",
    "this effect is very nicely demonstrated by anna _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , who showed experimentally how transition - rates change in different solvents , in good agreement with kramers theory @xcite .",
    "kramers theory simulates solvent dynamics as frictional drag and influence of random forces . for the sake of simplicity we assumed here that both effects are small at the temperature range considered , and opted to use regular rate theory .",
    "we have investigated the kinetics of aggregation and fragmentation in a simulation of associating polymers .",
    "the process was described in terms of master equations and rates of reactions were obtained from the simulation .",
    "the master equations were shown to have a solution consistent with the aggregate size distribution as obtained directly from the simulations .",
    "stability analysis showed that the aggregate distribution was indeed a stable solution to the master equations .",
    "we found that , since detailed balance holds within the simulation , knowledge of the @xmath62 rates provides all the necessary information to reproduce the complete aggregate size distribution .",
    "it was observed that changes with temperature of the reaction rates can explain the changes in the aggregate distribution and dynamics near the sol - gel transition .",
    "the onset temperature of this transition was determined as the temperature at which there first exist a range of @xmath41 values for which it is more likely that a single end group attaches to an aggregate than that one breaks off ( @xmath130 ) . near this temperature , @xmath89 begins to deviate from the arrhenius , fluid - like behavior .",
    "in addition a shoulder develops within the distribution . below the onset temperature ,",
    "aggregates have a preferred size .",
    "a symmetry inversion within the formation rate @xmath43 occurs at this size and marks a fundamental change in the aggregate formation process .",
    "aggregates smaller than the preferred size tend to be formed by joining two equal sized aggregates , whereas larger aggregates are formed by the addition of one end group . as temperature continues to decrease , the likelihood that @xmath131 is larger than @xmath47 ( measured as the area between the two curves of the rates versus @xmath41 ) grows .",
    "the maximum at @xmath116 , is in agreement with the micelle transition temperature .    in future work , we plan to investigate how the reaction rates are influenced by uniform and oscillatory shear .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the application of external stresses can influence the aggregate distribution ; however its influence on the kinetic processes in the system has been studied less .",
    "the master equations will be most likely a valuable tool in such studies as well .",
