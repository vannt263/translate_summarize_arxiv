    "importance of solvable models in physics is enormous . we can acquire qualitative understanding of the complicated realistic systems by analyzing simplified models that grab the essence of a physical reality .",
    "these models can serve as a test field for approximative methods , or can be used as initial solvable systems in a perturbative treatment . in this paper , we will focus on the construction and analysis of exactly solvable models described by the @xmath0-dimensional dirac equation .",
    "such systems lie in the overlap of the quantum field theory with the condensed matter physics .",
    "the one - dimensional dirac hamiltonian appears in the study of the gap equation of the @xmath1 dimensional version of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( chiral gross - neveu ) model @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or in the study of the fractionally charged solitons @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is used in the effective description of the non - relativistic fermions : in @xcite , the hamiltonian describes fermions coupled to solitons in the continuum model of a linear molecule of polyacetylene .",
    "it is employed in the analysis of the quasi - particle bound states associated with the planar solitons in superfluid @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it appears in the description of inhomogeneous superconductors @xcite and in the analysis of the vortex in the extreme type - ii superconductors in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it is used in the description of carbon nanotubes . in the low energy regime ,",
    "the band structure obtained by tight - binding approach can be approximated very well with the use of the one - dimensional dirac operator @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the stationary equation @xcite @xmath3 describes dynamics of the low - energy charge - carriers in single wall carbon nanotubes in presence of magnetic field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the green s function ( or its spatial trace called diagonal resolvent or gorkov green s function ) plays an important role in the above mentioned systems .",
    "it is used in solution of the gap equation @xcite or in the extremal analysis of the effective action @xcite in quantum field systems .",
    "it is employed in computation of the free energy of the inhomogeneous superconductors @xcite .",
    "it serves in derivation of the local density of states ( ldos ) , the quantity that can be measured in carbon nanostructures by the spectral tunneling microscopy @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this paper will be primarily discussed in the latter context .",
    "the carbon nanotubes are cylinders of small radius rolled up from graphene .",
    "they can be classified as either metallic or semiconducting , in dependence on their electronic properties . when no external potential is present , the semi - conducting nanotube has a spectral gap which is related to a constant value of the potential , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the value of the canonical momentum in the compactified direction . for @xmath6 , the nanotube is metallic as it has no gap in the spectrum . in this case ,",
    "an infinitesimally small excitation is sufficient to move the electrons from valence to conduction band .",
    "the actual value of @xmath5 is related to the orientation of the crystal lattice in the nanotube , see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the potential @xmath7 is smooth on the scale of the interatomic distance .",
    "otherwise , it would be necessary to work with an extended , @xmath8 , hamiltonian that would describe mixing of the states between the valleys associated with two inequivalent dirac points @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the matrix degree of freedom of @xmath9 in ( [ eq1 ] ) is the so - called pseudo - spin and is associated with the two triangular sublattices that build up the hexagonal structure of the graphene crystal ; the wave function with either spin - up or -down is identically zero on one of the sublattices .",
    "the inhomogeneous magnetic field can appear due to an external source .",
    "alternatively , it can emerge as a consequence of mechanical deformations of the lattice .",
    "let us make this point clear .",
    "deformation of the lattice is described by the vector @xmath10 which represents displacement of the atoms in the crystal .",
    "the associated strain tensor @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 the effective dirac hamiltonian which describes dynamics of quasi - particles in the low - energy regime gets the form @xmath13 , where we fixed the fermi velocity @xmath14 .",

    "the angle of the twist @xmath18 is related to the displacement @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a radius of the nanotube . in this way",
    ", the constant potential @xmath22 can be associated with a linear displacement @xmath23 that would be generated by the constant twist illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "it opens a gap in the spectrum of the metallic nanotube , however , it does not confine charge carriers .",
    "indeed , constant potential can be understood as a mass term in the hamiltonian describing the free particle .",
    "[ figlinear ]    in general , the electromagnetic field causes nontrivial scattering of the quasi - particles and can even cause the appearance of bound states in the system @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the quasi - particles in metallic nanotubes are not backscattered by electrostatic potential .",
    "this is understood as a manifestation of the klein tunneling @xcite and it has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was found recently that the phenomenon can be attributed to the peculiar supersymmetric structure that relates the hamiltonian of the system to that of the free dirac particle @xcite .    here , we will construct exactly solvable models described by ( [ eq1 ] ) where , despite the presence of the effective magnetic field",
    ", the scattering will be reflectionless and the bound states will be confined in the regions where the twist gets altered . in the construction , the techniques known in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics will be employed .",
    "we will focus to the spectral properties and green s function of the new systems .",
    "the latter one will be used for computation of the ldos .",
    "we will provide an analytical formula for bound state energies in dependence on the twist of the nanotubes .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the construction of solvable models based on darboux transformation with focus on the application in the context of carbon nanotubes .",
    "then the formulas for green s function and ldos of these models are provided .",
    "we discuss reflectionless systems and present two models of twisted carbon nanotubes .",
    "the last section is left for the discussion .",
    "we summarize here the main points of the construction of new solvable models which is based on the intertwining relations .",
    "this scheme is well known in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics @xcite . there , the intertwined second order schrdinger operators give rise to the supersymmetric hamiltonian while the intertwining operator , identified as the crum - darboux transformation , is associated with the supercharges of the system . in the current case , we will discuss briefly the technique in the context of the first order , one - dimensional dirac equation .",

    "let us have a physical system described by a solvable hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 with real and symmetric matrix potential @xmath25 and @xmath26 extending to the whole real axis .",

    "indeed , the twist associated with @xmath240 is @xmath241 the asymptotic twist corresponds to @xmath242 the dependence of the bound state energies on @xmath243 then acquires the following simple form @xmath244 and is plotted in figure [ fig5 ] .    up to now",
    ", the twisted nanotubes were considered to be metallic .",
    "the analysis can be extended to semi - conducting nanotubes without any difficulties ; a constant , nonzero , part of the vector potential @xmath245 has to be associated with the internal characteristics ( the orientation of the hexagonal lattice ) of the nanotube .",
    "let us notice in this context that the metallic nanotube can be converted into the semi - conducting one just by switching on the constant magnetic flux parallel to the axis of the nanotube .",
    "this fact was experimentally confirmed in @xcite and coined as aharonov - bohm oscillations of the carbon nanotubes . turning back to ( [ hiiex ] )",
    ", we can interpret the hamiltonian as the energy operator of the semiconducting nanotube with a radial twist associated to @xmath246 .",
    "the constant part @xmath247 of the potential appears due to the semiconducting nature of the nanotube .",
    "the expressions ( [ ldosi ] ) and ( [ ldosii ] ) can be written in the unified form @xmath248 where the sum is taken over the _ normalized _ bound states of @xmath249 annihilated by @xmath250 .",
    "it manifests a decrease of the ldos in the regions where the bound states are localized .",
    "however , it is rather just a peculiar property of the discussed reflectionless models @xcite . in general case , the ldos ( [ ggii ] ) of @xmath120 acquires the following form in terms of the vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", @xmath251 @xmath252 when @xmath161 is equal to the free particle hamiltonian , the coefficient of @xmath253 reduces to a constant .",
    "nevertheless , this apparently does not hold in the general case .",
    "we restricted our consideration just to the systems described by the hamiltonian @xmath254 .",
    "however , the potential term of the seed hamiltonian @xmath64 in ( [ seed ] ) can acquire quite generic form , yet keeping valid the formulas ( [ lgl ] ) and ( [ tildeldos ] ) for the green s functions and for the ldos .",
    "other results are more sensitive to the explicit form of the potential .",
    "the term @xmath255 can not cause any substantial modifications ; it would play just the role of non - physical gauge field . in",
    "contrary , impact of the diagonal term @xmath256 in @xmath38 would be much deeper : in general , it would break the symmetry @xmath257 of the spectrum @xmath258 of @xmath38 . in the context of dirac particles in the carbon nanotubes ,",
    "the potential @xmath259 would have different sign for the spin -up and -down components of wave function , i.e. this potential would change the sign on the two sublattices that form the crystal .",
    "physical realization of such a scenario in the considered condensed matter system is not clear .",
    "it is remarkable that the darboux transformation ( [ l ] ) does not alter the form of @xmath260 ; the new hamiltonian @xmath38 shares the same electrostatic potential as the seed hamiltonian .",
    "we notice that the electrostatic potential can be also altered via the so - called 0-th order supersymmetry , as it was discussed in @xcite .    in the discussed systems represented by the stationary equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , the analysis of the bound states can be facilitated by the fact that the square of the dirac hamiltonian takes the form @xmath261 .",
    "the existing tools ( see , e.g. @xcite ) for the analysis of the schrdinger operators can be exploited to reveal spectral properties of the dirac hamiltonian . in this context , let us mention that interesting results were obtained by the spectral analysis of general class of deformed quantum waveguides described by schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we believe that similar analysis for the carbon nanostructures described by the one- or two - dimensional dirac hamiltonian would be fruitful .",
    "the presented analysis is qualitative .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is a good approximation for the quasiparticles in carbon nanotubes only for small region of the momentum space where the linear dispersion relation is valid .",
    "when the gap opened by the pseudo - magnetic field in the spectrum is too big , nonlinear ( the so - called trigonal warping ) terms @xcite have to be included into the hamiltonian . in the article , we neglected surface curvature of the nanotubes .",
    "the tubular surface prevents the @xmath262-orbitals of the carbon atoms to be parallel to each other .",
    "this implies presence of additional pseudo - magnetic fields in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , in case of armchair nanotubes , these additional gauge fields can be transformed out @xcite .",
    "the examples presented in the text suggest that the non - uniform radial twist can induce bound states in the nanotube .",
    "in particular , the second model with double - kink potential provides an interesting qualitative insight into realistic experimental setting : the nanotube with asymptotically vanishing twist is immersed into the homogeneous magnetic field . besides the explicit formula ( [ ldosii ] ) for ldos , the model predicts the appearance of bound states and the formula ( [ induced ] ) fixes their energies in dependence on the asymptotic twist .",
    "the model can be simply tuned with the use of perturbation techniques .",
    "the supersymmetry can be very useful for construction of the models with more complicated ( yet asymptotically constant ) twist inducing richer spectral properties .",
    "the formalism presented in the second section can be repeated to produce a chain of solvable hamiltonians , @xmath64 , @xmath38 , @xmath263 , by taking the last constructed operator as the seed hamiltonian for the new system .",
    "these new solvable systems shall provide insight into the _ deformation - induced spectral engineering _ of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the reflectionless models are particularly important in this context ; they are analytically feasible and possess nontrivial ( super)symmetry , analog of ( [ a ] ) and ( [ dressedhiddensusy ] ) .",
    "the considered double - kink example suggests that the number of bound states could be in a simple relation to the vector potential of the hamiltonian ; the number of bound states might be proportional to the number of minima of the potential .",
    "verification of this hypothesis goes beyond the scope of the current paper and should be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the work has been partially supported by fondecyt grant no .",
