    "left - right symmetric models with spontaneous parity breaking offer a natural explanation for the parity asymmetry observed in nature . the gauge group @xmath2 fixes the interactions and generalizes the standard electroweak theory . however the fundamental fermionic representation and the higgs sector",
    "are not completely determined . for",
    "the fermions one can have two possibilities : new right - handed doublets , as in the earlier models@xcite , or new mirror fermions@xcite .",
    "the higgs sector has more possibilities and introduces more unknown parameters in the model .",
    "it is highly desirable to have the minimum number of unknown parameters in order to compare models and experimental data .",
    "a recent work in this direction was done by brahmachari , ma and sarkar @xcite . with two higgs doublets , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and a dimension five operator they have proposed a left - right model including fermion masses .",
    "another mirror model with two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets was developed in ref.3 . in both cases",
    "the condition @xmath5 must be satisfied . the present experimental bound is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "later on , siringo @xcite revived an earlier remark by senjanovic and mohapatra @xcite that the above condition can not be satisfied in models with only two higgs doublets .",
    "these remarks seems to leave open the possibility that only scalar bidoublets could break parity in a consistent way .",
    "this possibility exists but has the unpleasant feature of a large number of higgs fields and undetermined parameters .    however , there is other elegant way @xcite to produce the condition ( 1 ) by introducing one singlet higgs which is odd under @xmath0-parity .",
    "the difference with the @xmath7-parity breaking is that in @xmath0-parity the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a parity odd field can be spontaneously broken without breaking the left - right symmetry . in consequence ,",
    "the gauge coupling constants of @xmath8 and @xmath9 also can be different and left - handed and right - handed scalars can have different masses and vevs .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the previous analysis to include also a singlet higgs field which is even under @xmath0-parity and mixes with the odd field .",
    "we show that this mixing term also contribute to the hierarchy relation ( 1 ) .",
    "we include in our study two examples of grand unified theories where higgs singlets transforming under @xmath0-parity are assigned to the l - r symmetric model and to a mirror fermion model .",
    "there are two forms of breaking parity spontaneously : the first is to identify the discrete symmetry @xmath10 that interchanges the groups @xmath9  and @xmath8 of the lorentz group @xmath11 as the parity operator @xmath7 that transforms the higgs bosons @xmath12 and also @xmath13 .",
    "so , when @xmath8 is broken in the symmetric l - r model , parity @xmath7 is also broken .",
    "the second possibility of spontaneously breaking the parity symmetry is through the vev of an odd scalar field which preserves l - r symmetry .",
    "this type of parity is called @xmath0-parity which is a generator of larger groups that contain the product @xmath14 as a subgroup .",
    "this second possibility is very interesting because it allows @xmath15 with different coupling constants for @xmath9 and @xmath8 and different masses for the higgs fields .",
    "our model for the scalar potential includes two doublets and two singlets higgs fields .",
    "these singlets and doublets transforms under @xmath0-parity as @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 , if in the model there are no cp violating terms or no complex yukawa couplings .",
    "we propose the following invariant potential under @xmath19 for the higgs fields @xmath20 our motivation for this potential is the fact that @xmath21 and @xmath22 do not necessarily belong to the same irreducible multiplet of higgs fields . in consequence",
    "it is also possible that these fields are mixed . if this is the case , when @xmath23  and @xmath24 the potential terms that contributes to the masses of higgs fields @xmath4 and @xmath25  are    @xmath26    from which we obtain the masses @xmath27 now we impose the hierarchy condition in the previous equations such that @xmath28 @xmath29.it is necessary to indicate that @xmath30 breaks the electroweak symmetry and @xmath31 breaks the l - r symmetry close to the tev scale .",
    "so we can have , for example @xmath32 and , ; @xmath33 it also must be noted that if @xmath22  and @xmath21 are in the same multiplet , then several possible mixing terms in the potential possibility are absent .",
    "let us now suppose that there are no cp violating terms and that all vevs are considered to be real",

    "additionally , if @xmath42 then @xmath41-parity is conserved and the l - r symmetry condition is recovered , @xmath43 .",
    "we have showed that the in our potential it is possible to construct models with l - r symmetry and producing an hierarchy between the breaking scale of @xmath8 and the electroweak scale .",
    "the main ingredient is the presence of two higgs singlets to generate the minimum of the potential .",
    "the crucial point in this sense is the inclusion of the mixing term @xmath44 which is possible if @xmath45 and @xmath22 belong to different irreducible representations . as in the previous term ,",
    "also the term @xmath46 breaks the l - r symmetry .",
