    "the cbm experiment will conduct a comprehensive research programme on nucleus - nucleus collisions at fair  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the cbm project is to investigate the largely unexplored qcd phase diagram at highest net baryon densities and moderate temperatures , complemetary to the heavy ion programmes at rhic and at lhc that address the physics of the early universe at low densities and high temperatures . with projectile energies between 10 and 45@xmath0",
    "gev sis-300 will provide intense beams in the range where the highest net baryon densities are predicted to reach about 10  times that of ground state nuclear matter .",
    "this will enable the cbm programme to focus on signatures of the expected first order phase transition from partonic to hadronic matter , ending in a critical point , and on modifications of hadron properties , e.g. their masses , in the dense nuclear medium as a signal of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the research programme may already be started at sis-100 with ion beams between 2 and 11@xmath0  gev , and protons up to 29  gev energy using the hades detector and an initial version of the cbm experiment .",
    "recently proposed other programmes in this beam energy range at rhic / bnl and nica/ jinr will be complementary to the cbm programme as they are limited in interaction rates and will focus on bulk particle production .",
    "the full exploration including rare probes will be the task of the cbm experiment at fair .",
    "two configurations of the cbm detector are being evaluated for electron - hadron and muon - hadron measurements",
    ". both may be realized at different stages .",
    "they have in common a low - mass silicon tracking system ( sts ) , the central detector to perform charged - particle tracking and high - resolution momentum measurement with radiation tolerant silicon microstrip and pixel detectors . combined with an ultra - thin micro - vertex detector ( mvd ) based on monolithic active pixel sensors , it will be installed in the gap of a dipole magnet in short distance downstream of the target , typically a gold foil of 250  @xmath1 m thickness corresponding to 1%  nuclear interaction length . in the electron - hadron configuration ,",
    "the cbm experiment comprises a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector downstream of the magnet to identify electron pairs from vector meson decays .",
    "transition radiation detectors ( trds ) provide charged particle tracking and the identification of high energy electrons .",
    "hadron identification will be realized in a time - of - flight ( tof ) system built from resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) will be used to detect direct photons .",
    "the projectile spectator detector ( psd ) is a calorimeter that determines centrality and reaction plane of the collisions . in the muon - hadron configuration of the experiment ,",
    "the rich detector system is replaced by a compact active absorber system ( much ) .",
    "vector mesons are detected via their decays into muon pairs .",
    "hadrons can be measured with the absorbers moved out . a particular feature of the experiment is its data acquisition and trigger concept , imposed by the physics programme with rare probes , e.g. charm production near threshold , and the necessity for interaction rates between 0.1 and 10  mhz .",
    "it is based exclusively on self - triggering front - end electronics that time - stamps the detector signals and ships them to a fast computing farm for event building and high - level trigger generation .",
    "progress with the preparation of the experiment has been achieved with detailed physics performance simulations , based on increasingly realistic implementations of the cbm detector systems .",
    "this includes feed - back from the beginning detector developments and the evaluation of first demonstrator systems in test - beam experiments  @xcite .",
    "the high multiplicity of charged particles is reconstructed with the silicon tracking system  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of essentially all cbm observables depends on the high performance of the sts .",
    "currently 8 tracking stations are considered in a 1  t dipole magnetic field based on radiation tolerant silicon micro - strip sensors mounted on a light - weight carbon fibre support structure .",
    "the material budget may be less then 1% radiation length per station .",
    "in central 25@xmath0  gev au+au events , generated with urqmd , tracks pointing to the primary vertex are reconstructed with 96% efficiency above momenta of 1  gev / c using cellular automaton and kalman filter algorithms .",
    "the material budget is such that a momentum resolution of 1.3% is obtained .",
    "electron identification is performed using a ring imaging cherenkov detector and a transition radiation detector system .",
    "the rich system uses a co@xmath2 radiator of 1.5  m length , providing a pion separation threshold momentum of 4.65  gev / c .",
    "mirrors of 12  m@xmath3 area project electron ring images of about 6  cm diameter onto the 2.4  m@xmath3 photo detection plane . the ring finding efficiency , evaluated in simulations with several reconstruction algorithms , is in excess of 95% for electrons embedded into central au+au collisions at 25@xmath0  gev beam energy . the detector r&d for the rich system focusses on the evaluation of thin spherical glass mirrors of 3  m radius with al+mgf@xmath2 coating and multi - anode photo multiplier tubes coupled to self - triggering readout electronics . for the trd detector ,",
    "innovative multi - wire proportional chambers with double - sided pad readout coupled to a foil radiator are being developed , capable of high counting rates .",
    "the combined electron identification efficiency of rich and trd is 85% at a @xmath4 suppression factor of 10@xmath5 .",
    "the remaining background is dominated by @xmath6 dalitz decays  @xcite .    muon identification is performed with a segmented hadron absorber and a tracking system downstream of the sts .",
    "the much system is divided into two regions addressing low - mass muon pairs ( vector mesons ) and high - mass pairs ( j/@xmath7 ) .",
    "five iron discs of 20  cm to 35  cm thickness , with a total thickness of 7.5 nuclear interaction lengths , are interleaved with 5  gaps of gem detector layers and serve the measurement of the low - mass vector mesons .",
    "after another 1  m of iron and total 13.5  nuclear interaction lengths , the j/@xmath7 pair candidates are detected .",
    "the particle multiplicity is reduced such that after 1.25  m iron 0.25 identified muons are obtained in 25@xmath0  gev au+au with the dominant background coming from @xmath4 and k decays at 0.13  muons per event  @xcite .",

    "different rpc technologies are being explored , including ultra - thin glass pad rpc , ceramic rpc , and differential rpc based on semi - conductive glass .",
    "high counting rate capability up to 25  khz has to be achieved with a time resolution of 80  ps  @xcite .",
    "the `` global '' track reconstruction efficiency obtained with the simulated sts , trd and tof systems is 85% .",
    "the efficient separation of primary and short - lived decay vertices for open charm detection requires a z - vertex resolution of the order of 50  @xmath1 m r.m.s .",
    "this is planned to be realized with a two - station micro vertex detector in front of the silicon tracker , built from monolithic active pixel sensors  @xcite .",
    "the stations must be ultra - thin .",
    "two mvd stations with a material budget of 0.3% and 0.5% radiation lengths have been studied at 5  cm and 10  cm downstream of the target .",
    "no k and p identification is performed but proton rejection via tof .",
    "the interaction rate is limited to 10@xmath8/s as imposed by the maximum readout speed of the monolithic pixel detectors . with this mvd system ,",
