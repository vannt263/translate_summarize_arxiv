    "we aim at investigating the source of absorption and infrared emission of the dust that is responsible for obscuring the agn in x - ray new - type objects .",
    "since it is unclear if these objects really consistute a new class of agn , we will refer to them as `` low - scattering '' objects throughout the paper , which adequately relates to their observed characteristics .",

    "we present an alternative explanation for the peculiar properties of low - scattering sources in sect .",
    "[ sec : newmod ] and discuss their place in the broad context of agn unification . finally in sect .",

    "low - scattering agn were identified and defined as objects with a soft x - ray scattering fraction of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "no other criteria have been used to associate objects with this group initially . in order to obtain a meaningful sample and analyze the group statistically within the framework of agn unification ,",
    "it is necessary to select objects from an x - ray - complete catalog .",
    "such a catalog is available from the swift / bat hard - x - ray mission that lists all objects detected in the 14195kev band over a given period of time .",
    "therefore , we follow @xcite and use the 128 detections over the first 9 months of the swift / bat survey @xcite that were associated with non - blazar agn by @xcite .",
    "although there are deeper samples available by now ( most notably 22 , 54 , and 70 month catalogs ) , the convenience of this well - defined sample originates from the wealth of complementary data that have been collected for all objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "13 objects have been identified as low - scattering agn out of the 128 non - blazar agn in the swift / bat 9-month catalog @xcite .",
    "we list all these objects in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "in addition we computed hard - x - ray luminosities , @xmath10 , using fluxes reported in the 22-month swift / bat catalog by @xcite , which have generally higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) than in the 9-month catalog due to the longer integration times .",
    "the only exception is ngc 454 which was detected at s / n=4.54 in the 9-month sample but does not show up above the 22-month sample limit of s / n=4.8 .",
    "table  [ tab : sample ] also includes x - ray column densities obtained from spectral fitting by @xcite .    in table  [",
    "tab : sample ] we also list four more low - scattering objects that have been identified by @xcite in the _ xmm _ agn source catalog @xcite . this catalog , however , is not complete since it was extracted from all pointings of _ xmm _ with different exposure times on selected areas of the sky .",
    "therefore we do not include these objects in our analysis related to unification issues / agn statistics , but will use them when dealing with specific properties of low - scattering agn as an object class . in particular , we will use these objects in sect .  [",
    "sec : stat ] to increase number statistics when studying the host galaxies of low - scattering agn .      in this paper",
    "we want to address the questions if we can find evidence of a large dust covering factor of the low - scattering agn and/or if other factors may also play a role in the observed low soft - x - ray scattering fractions . here",
    ", we primarily focus on the optical and infrared regimes to find clues on the nature of the obscuration associated with these objects and for direct evidence of large covering factors by ir reemission that is significantly stronger than in typical seyfert galaxies compared to the agn luminosity traced by the bat @xmath40kev emission ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : mirx ] for details ) .",
    "the ir emission of the low - scattering objects has been previously discussed by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed broad - band _ 2mass _ photometry in the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 bands as well as 9@xmath44 , 18@xmath44 , and 90@xmath44 photometry obtained by the _",
    "satellite mission and found possible evidence for enhanced star - formation as compared to other type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "given the low spatial resolution and limited spectral coverage of these data , it is , however , difficult to disentangle galaxy - scale emission from the circumnuclear environment . therefore we chose another strategy : we searched the _ spitzer _",
    "archive for irs spectra and found suitable low - resolution data for 12 of the 13 sources .",
    "although at this spatial resolution host and agn emission are still confused , the spectral coverage allows us to use a decomposition technique to isolate the nuclear ir emission .",
    "for that , we computed a star - formation template by comparing objects that show star - formation signatures in irs spectra but are devoid of any such features in our ground - based vlt / visir spectra with @xmath4510 times better spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "the template covers the @xmath46 wavelength region .",
    "we determined the 11.3@xmath44 pah equivalent width in all the irs spectra and , accordingly , scaled and subtracted the template .",
    "the resulting spectra resemble the ground - based high - angular resolution spectra of agn ( i.e. they are free of any star - formation features ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we consider them representative for the agn ir emission .    from these spectra we computed three quantities that are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] :",
    "( 1 ) the nuclear 12@xmath44 luminosities @xmath47 of the agn ; ( 2 ) the optical depth @xmath8 of the silicate feature located at about @xmath48 ; and ( 3 ) the spectral slope @xmath49 in the mid - ir .",
    "the latter two quantities were obtained by applying the same method used for ground - based spectra in @xcite with the same wavelength coverage .",
    "where the star - formation templates accounted for all emission in the @xmath46 band , we provide upper limits to the mid - ir luminosity .    finally ,",
    "in order to test the origin of the obscuration , we inspect optical dss images of the complete sample to look for any host galaxy feature that may intersect with the nucleus .",
    "the images of all thirteen bat sources and four additional _ xmm _ sources are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] .",
    "we selected images from the rather old dss survey since they contain the whole sample uniformly , while newer surveys , such as sdss , miss several ones .",
    "one question that has not been addressed for low - scattering agn yet is whether their peculiar properties are related to the host galaxies .",
    "indeed , @xcite note that while agn with low x - ray column densities are preferentially found in host galaxies with low inclination , those at higher column densities are found in galaxies of any inclination .",
    "this suggests that the host galaxy can contribute at least in part to obscuration in agn .",
    "a recent comparison of 10@xmath44 silicate absorption features , x - ray column densities , and host inclinations confirms this idea for highly - obscured objects @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that deep silicate absorption typically appears in agn where the galaxy is edge - on or engaged in a merger . in such galaxies , it is very likely that dust lanes are projected onto the nuclear region .",
    "finally , using an isotropically selected sample , @xcite showed that type 2 agn do not reside in galaxies with a preferred inclination . in their sample",
    ", there seems to be a lack of type 1 agn in edge - on galaxies .",
    "however , this can be explained by obscuration preferentially taking place on galactic scales that leads to an `` intrinsic type 1 '' being classified as a type 2 . when taking this effect into account , kinney et al .",
    "conclude that the orientation of the agn and the host galaxy are completely random and not correlated .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who also noted a substantial deficiency of seyfert 1 galaxies with nearly edge - on host inclinations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from these studies",
    "we conclude that while there is no correlation between host and agn orientation , an inclined host can influence the classification of an agn , making it appear as a type 2 independent of its actual intrinsic / torus orientation .",
    "we take this as a motivation to quantitatively assess if host galaxy inclination might play a role in the low - scattering phenomenon .    in table",
    "[ tab : sample ] we list the inclinations of the 13 low - scattering agn host galaxies in the bat sample as well as for 3 out of the 4 xmm objects .",
    "these inclinations have been taken from the hyperleda catalog and are calculated based on optically - decomposed galaxy morphologies , i.e. major- and minor axis as well as hubble type ( see the catalog s website for further details ) .",
    "no inclination was listed in the database for 3c  33 , which only appears as a point source in the dss image .",
    "the inclinations from the database match the overall impression of the dss images in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] well . however , in cases of merger systems , the host galaxy can be severely distorted and , therefore , the hubble type may not be uniquely determined .",
    "the question we want to answer is whether the host galaxies of low - scattering objects show any preferred orientation .",
    "the low - scattering sample for this type of investigation does not require to be selected from a complete agn parent sample , as long as the parent sample does not favor any host inclination . neither the bat nor the xmm catalog bias towards any host galaxy orientation in the first place .",
    "hence , we combine the bat and xmm objects in this study to increase sample statistics to a total of 16 objects with known inclinations . when considering the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , however , it may be possible that some agn in edge - on galaxies are missing from the samples because of higher obscuration and , therefore , lower x - ray fluxes . in this respect",
    ", our sample might be slightly biased towards lower host inclination , which we will discuss later .",
    "looking at the dss images in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] , we find it remarkable that at least 12/16 low - scattering agn may be clearly classified as edge - on , merging , or interacting by visual inspection of the optical images only .",
    "more quantitatively , in a random inclination distribution @xmath50 of objects are expected to be seen at inclinations @xmath51 . table  [ tab : sample ] shows that the host galaxies of the low - scattering sample display such high inclinations at a rate of 50% ( 8/16 ) .",
    "conversely , it suggests a deficiency of low - inclination objects among the low - scattering class .    .",
    "for all three sub - samples we simulated 100000 random realizations assuming an inclination error of 5@xmath52 ( 1@xmath53 ) .",
    "these realizations are shown as light - red , light - blue , and light - green for the three sub - samples , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to be more quantitative , we want to test if the low - scattering agn prefer any host inclinations . in principle , host galaxy inclinations should follow a random distribution where the fraction of objects @xmath54 seen at an inclination @xmath55 or greater is given by the solid angle covered by these angles as @xmath56 .",
    "however , since we do not know how well this distribution is reproduced by the method used to determine inclinations in the hyperleda database , we took a different approach .",
    "we extracted inclinations of the whole bat 9-month catalog from the hyperleda catalog and divided the objects into two sub - samples : ( 1 ) the thirteen low - scattering agn ; ( 2 ) all other 115 agn .",
    "then we can compare the inclination distributions of both samples by a two - sided ks test .",
    "if the low - scattering agn do not favor any specific host inclination , we expect that both samples follow the same distribution .",
    "although no errors are provided by hyperleda , we also consider a 5@xmath52 uncertainty ( 1-@xmath53 error ; gaussian error distribution ) on each inclination value and simulate 100000 realizations for the two sub - samples .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ks ] . based on the ks test",
    ", we find a median probability that two random draws from a single parent distribution would produce the observed distributions of low - scattering agn and all bat sources without low - scattering agn of only @xmath57 ( significance 2.6@xmath53 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the low - scattering agn favor certain inclinations .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : ks ] clearly shows that the low - scattering agn class populates the high - inclinations that are missing in the sub - sample where the low - scattering objects have been excluded .",
    "one selection effect not considered in this comparison is the fact that low - scattering agn can only be identified by spectral modeling if absorption is detected .",
    "this favors `` intrinsic '' type 2 agn against type 1 agn .",
    "we address this bias by also comparing the low - scattering agn to all bat agn in the same column density range as the low - scattering agn , @xmath58 , but excluding the low - scattering objects from the sample .",
    "the cumulative distribution of this obscured agn comparison sample is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ks ] .",
    "we find a slightly increased null hypothesis probability of @xmath59 when comparing this sample to the low - scattering agn .",
    "however , this lower significance is only a result of the decreased sample statistics with respect to the full bat 9-month catalog .",
    "indeed , the ks statistics remains essentially unchanged ( @xmath60 for the full sample vs. @xmath61 for the column - restricted sample ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the preference of high host inclination of low - scattering agn is present even when comparing them with objects in the same column density range .    in summary",
    ", we find evidence that the low - scattering agn are preferentially hosted in edge - on galaxies .",
    "this implies that absorption within the host galaxy , not intrinsic to the immediate agn environment , might play an important role in the observed properties of this class of objects . as mentioned before , it is well possible that the x - ray samples slightly bias against agn in galaxies at high inclination and , thus , potentially against low - scattering objects .",
    "therefore , the evidence for high - inclination preference may become stronger as more such objects are identified with bat .",
    "one way to directly test the hypothesis of a deeply - buried agn in low - scattering objects is determining the dust covering factors . for",
    "that we need an ir sed over a wide wavelength range that is dominated by dust reemission of the big - blue bump of the hidden agn . in practice , high - angular resolution data are required to minimize host - galactic contamination .",

    "the fit to the sed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eso103 ] as a green - dotted line .",
    "integration of the continuous model sed results in a bolometric ir luminosity of @xmath71 .",
    "we also need a way to determine the luminosity of the big - blue bump , @xmath72 , to constrain the covering factor .",
    "since the agn is heavily obscured , it is not possible to get this information directly from the optical / uv sed , which is dominated by starlight .",
    "however , the nucleus is obscured by a compton - thin gas column , meaning that we can use the x - ray luminosity as a proxy to estimate @xmath72 . in @xcite",
    ", we refer to an absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity @xmath73 ( corrected for the different cosmological parameters ) .",
    "using the relation between @xmath74 and @xmath72 by @xcite , we obtain @xmath75 .",
    "based on our values for @xmath72 and @xmath76 , we calculate the ( bolometric ) covering factor @xmath77 .",
    "while this is the most direct way of testing the buried agn scenario , the constraint we get is rather weak given the large uncertainty on @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we can not use this method in the case of eso 103g35 as an individual source .",
    "however , it may become more relevant in the future when good ir seds of the other low - scattering agn become available and a sample average can be determined with smaller errors .    given this prospective , we want to remind the reader of a fundamental issue of covering factors .",
    "the reason why we call the covering factor determined this way as `` bolometric '' is related to the anisotropic radiation from the agn . in non - spherically",
    "obscured agn , i.e. as in a toroidal geometry , some degree of anisotropy of the emerging ir can be expected depending on the line - of - sight toward the obscurer , e.g. as seen in radiative transfer models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the observationally - determined covering factor depends on viewing angle and potentially details of the dust distribution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the actual distribution of optically thick and thin dust may be more complex , making the definition of a covering factor even more ambiguous ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "having a well - covered ir sed also allows us to constrain the dust mass that participates in ir emission .",
    "we fitted a gray body spectrum to the peak region and rayleigh - jeans tail of the ir sed of eso  103g35 by fixing the dust opacity at 100@xmath44 to @xmath78 and leaving the spectral index of the wavelength - dependence of @xmath79 and the peak emission temperature @xmath80 as free parameters . as a result",
    ", we obtained a peak temperature @xmath81k and @xmath82 , and accordingly a dust mass of @xmath83 .",
    "we can estimate the scale at which the bulk of this mass is located , under the assumption that the ir - emitting dusty gas is identical to the x - ray obscuring material , as @xmath84 for a dust mass @xmath85 , a hydrogen column density @xmath86 , and a dust - to - gas ratio @xmath87 .",
    "for eso  103g35 we obtain @xmath88 , meaning that the bulk of the ir - emitting dust mass is located on scales commonly associated with the torus .",
    "we want to emphasize , however , that this does not rule out a cool host - galactic screen absorber that is responsible for the strong silicate absorption feature , optical extinction , and potentially affecting the soft x - ray spectrum , since a column density of the order @xmath2 in a galactic dust cloud is sufficient to explain these . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eso103 ] we also show the emission from a host - galactic dust cloud with a temperature of 50k , the same size as the nuclear dust ( to allow complete covering ) and a tenth of the column density . as evident , the contribution to the emission is @xmath891% at any wavelength in the range we show .",
    "this illustrates that a significant amount of host - galactic cool dust can still be projected on the nucleus without showing up as emission in the 1@xmath21500@xmath44 sed    to summarize , we conclude that the ir emission in eso  103g35 does not allow for a strong constraint on the covering factor of dust .",
    "we conclude , however , that the ir _ emitting _ dust is located within scales of @xmath6910pc , consistent with the classical torus and ir interferometry observations that resolve these spatial scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations do not rule out a cold screen absorber that could be responsible for the lack of soft x - rays and strong optical extinction .",
    "in fact , a deep silicate absorption feature in the ir sed lends support to this idea since dust on sub - parsec scales would probably be warm enough ( @xmath90100k ) to contribute to silicate emission and fill up ( part of ) the absorption feature ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since we do not have the same quality ir sed for the other objects as we have for eso  103g35 , we are not able to directly determine the dust covering factors of the whole sample . however , if the covering factors in these objects are really high , we would expect that the ratio of a dust reemission tracer to an agn luminosity tracer is particularly high compared to a more general agn sample",
    ". the ratio of high - angular resolution mid - ir emission to ( absorption - corrected ) x - ray emission may serve as such a covering factor tracer ratio . over the last years",
    "a baseline for this ratio has been established in the form of a tight correlation between the mid - ir and x - ray emission from scales @xmath18100pc around the agn @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this ratio is investigated for the whole bat 9-month sample and , unlike previous publications , considers both the @xmath6kev as well as the @xmath40kev energy regions .",
    "moreover , the ratio is also studied as a function of hydrogen column density @xmath91 .     of bat agn .",
    "the black , solid line shows the cumulative distribution of all agn in the bat 9-month catalog with x - ray column densities @xmath92 .",
    "the blue , dash - dotted line represents all low - scattering agn identified in the bat catalog , while the red , dashed line shows all bat agn with @xmath93 excluding the low - scattering sources . in the small inset we plot the actual source number distributions of all three samples.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the present analysis",
    "we are mostly interested in a comparison of the mid - ir / hard x - ray ratio @xmath94 of the complete bat catalog  mainly consisting of local seyfert galaxies  with the low - scattering agn .",
    "if these were indeed deeply buried , we would expect that their mid - ir / x - ray ratio is larger than for the average seyferts , since the reprocessing surface ( mid - ir ) is larger compared to other agn with the same intrinsic luminosity ( x - ray ) .",
    "we produce three different subsamples from the full bat catalog data in @xcite : ( a ) all bat sources with @xmath92 ( mean luminosity @xmath95 ) ; ( b ) all bat sources with @xmath58 that are not low - scattering agn ( @xmath96 ) ; ( c ) all low - scattering agn in the bat sample ( @xmath97 ) . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : sample ] , the low - scattering objects have hydrogen column densities in the range of approximately @xmath58 .    to answer the question",
    "if the low - scattering agn show any difference with respect to other seyfert galaxies , we compare @xmath94 of the low - scattering sample to all other bat agn within the same column density range .",
    "for that we perform a two - sided ks test on the distribution of @xmath94 .",
    "the cumulative distributions of the low - scattering sample ( blue , dash - dotted ) and the bat agn in the same @xmath91 range ( red , dotted ) are shown in fig .",

    "we use the bat objects at lower @xmath91 as a control sample ( black , solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ks_ratio ] ) .",

    "* ) which is consistent with the idea of anisotropic absorption and/or ir emission , e.g. as caused by the agn torus or by host - galactic dust lanes between low- and high-@xmath91 objects depends on the assumption that the 14@xmath21195kev radiation is emitted more isotropically than the 12@xmath44 radiation . ] .",
    "the actual degree of anisotropy , its consequences on covering factors , and its relation to the nature of the dusty torus are long - debated issues and we refer the reader to other work ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "the main point here is that the ratio of both the low - scattering and `` normal '' agn at the same column density show about the same distribution .",
    "having in mind that @xmath94 is a tracer ratio for the covering factor , we conclude that we do not find any indication that low - scattering objects show any different covering factors than other objects with the same x - ray obscuration .",
    "therefore we conclude that there is most likely no difference in mid - ir / x - ray ratios between low - scattering and non - low - scattering agn .",
    "one of the signs that might have been taken as evidence for low - scattering agn being deeply buried is the deep @xmath48 silicate absorption feature seen in spitzer spectra of some sources .",
    "a complication when determining the strength of these features arise from pah emission that is frequently present in spectral data of lower angular distribution .",
    "not taking this into account would lead to an overestimation of the silicate absorption arising from the active nucleus . as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : optir ] , we determined the optical depth in the silicate feature @xmath8 without pah contamination for the 13 low - scattering agn in the bat 9-month catalog .",
    "the values listed in table  [ tab : sample ] cover a range of @xmath100 , with most of the objects showing @xmath101 .",
    "these values are actually not particular high .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that most seyfert 2 agn cover a range from about @xmath102 .",
    "the seyfert 2 mean ( median ) is @xmath103 ( 0.2 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note their reverse definition of emission and absorption ) which is exactly the same as for the low - scattering sources in this paper .",
    "deeper silicate absorption features are generally associated with cold dust in the host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or , at least , at large distances from the agn as in ulirgs @xcite ; see also the discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : eso103 ] .    possible evidence for a deeply buried agn could come from the mid - ir spectral index .",
    "if the agn is deeply buried in optically very thick dust , the emerging ir emission should be redder than for normal seyferts , since the effective temperature at which the radiation escapes is cooler .",
    "@xcite used spitzer spectra and determined ratios between the 5.5@xmath44 and 14.5@xmath44 fluxes for seyfert 2 nuclei that correspond to a spectral index of approximately @xmath104 , very similar to the range covered by their seyfert 1s . based on ground - based high angular resolution mid - ir spectra of a sample of nearby seyfert galaxies",
    ", we found a range for mid - ir spectral indices of @xmath105 with none of the objects being classified as a low - scattering source @xcite .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : sample ] , the ( dereddened ) mid - ir spectral index of the decomposed agn emission of the low - scattering objects covers about @xmath106 , which is consistent with the range of normal seyferts .",
    "we conclude that the observed @xmath48 silicate absorption features of low - scattering agn cover about the same values as those of normal seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the largest @xmath8 is consistent with objects where significant part of the absorption occurs in the host galaxy .",
    "moreover we do not find any evidence for a low effective temperature of the mid - ir emission of low - scattering objects .",
    "such a low temperature with the associated red mid - ir spectral index could be expected if an object is deeply buried within a geometrically and optically very thick shell .",
    "however , it is not found here .",
    "our analysis strongly implies that low - scattering agn have the same ir properties as other seyfert 2 galaxies and that the only notable difference is the preferred high inclination of the host galaxies .",
    "this suggests that absorption in the host galaxy plays an important role in shaping the appearance of an obscured agn as a low - scattering object in the present sample .",
    "based on the finding in sect .",
    "[ sec : discu ] , we want to put forward the idea to the current discussion that cold , neutral dust and gas in the host galaxy of low - scattering agn absorbs and/or scatters the soft part of the agn x - ray emission that arises from scattering , photoionization and/or thermal radiation .    based on the physical parameters determined for eso  103g35 , we estimate that the host absorption component could have a hydrogen column density of the order of @xmath107 . without the intention to do detailed modeling of specific objects",
    ", we simulated an xspec spectrum of a host - obscured type 2 agn ( @xmath108 at redshift @xmath109 ) that mimics the perceived low soft x - ray scattering fraction .",
    "this spectrum is shown in fig  [ fig : xabs ] .",
    "as in normal type 2 agn , the intrinsic agn x - ray power - law emission ( photon index @xmath110 ; high - energy cutoff at 300kev ) is absorbed by the torus ( phabs@xmath111 ) with a column density @xmath112 ( as typically seen in low - scattering objects ) .",
    "in addition , the agn environment produces a reflected component ( pexrav ; 2@xmath113 reflection ) and an intrinsic scattered component ( @xmath114*pow ) with a scattering fraction @xmath115 , similar to what has been found in many seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , this total agn spectrum ( @xmath114*pow + phabs@xmath111*pow + pexrav ) passes through host - galactic gas and dust ( phabs@xmath116 ) with @xmath117 .",
    "the resulting observed soft x - ray flux would be @xmath118 while the source emits @xmath119 intrinsically .",
    "this leads to an effective / observed scattering fraction @xmath120 , which is consistent with classification as a low - scattering agn .",
    "the flux levels in the @xmath121 region may be further reduced by a factor of @xmath9010 when increasing the host absorption by a factor of 3 . in that case any additional , much weaker scattering component from the very largest scales , or any agn photoionization component or thermal emission from the host , will be able to stand out below 3kev and mimic the spectra shown in @xcite .",
    "we note again that this particular model is for illustration purposes only .",
    "actual tests will require modeling of the detailed x - ray emission from a whole sample of low - scattering agn ( or an average spectrum ) and thorough exploration of the parameter space .",
    "in addition , better spectral constraints below 1kev are needed for the low - scattering objects .    host galaxy interference with the line - of - sight to the nucleus",
    "could also explain the results by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , these authors found that low - scattering agn potentially show increased star - formation in their ( nuclear ) mid - ir emission in wise as compared to other type 2 agn .",
    "as previously mentioned , the host galaxies of type 2 agn do not show any preferred inclination of their host galaxies @xcite . with or without circumnuclear star - formation actually present ,",
    "a small subset of these type 2 hosts will be seen edge - on so that host star - formation may be projected onto the nucleus .",
    "this will show up as a weak feature of star - formation in composite spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "low - scattering agn are a subset of type 2 agn being preferentially hosted in edge - on galaxies ( or mergers ) . in these systems",
    "the probability of having host star - formation projected onto the nucleus is much higher than for the total type 2 class that includes all inclinations ( i.e. also including low inclinations where the host is not projected onto the nuclear region ) .",
    "therefore , the potentially increased star - formation in low - scattering objects may just be a selection effect .",
    "we note that the reverse argument may be true for the perceived lower star - formation rate in type 1s as compared to type 2 agn : according to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , agn classified as type 1 have a deficiency of highly - inclined host galaxies which would reduce the likelihood of projecting host star - formation onto the nucleus .",
    "both examples illustrate the importance of host galaxy absorption / projection and related selection effects in agn classification .",
    "an open issue is the presumed low [ ] equivalent width in low - scattering agn .",
    "based on our host - absorption scenario , we would expect significant extinction toward the nlr ( e.g. as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we encourage follow - up studies along this line .",
    "of particular interest is a comparison of optical emission lines to high - ionization mid - ir agn tracer lines , which could reveal potential host absorption toward the nlr .",
    "it is worth noting that for eso  005g4 @xcite found [ ] ( 14.32@xmath44 ) and [ ] ( 25.89@xmath44 ) luminosities that are typical for other seyfert galaxies .",
    "they conclude that the missing optical high - ionization lines are probably caused by host - galactic dust since this pattern is also sometimes found in other agn hosted by highly - inclined galaxies that are not classified as low - scattering .",
    "if this holds true for the other low - scattering objects , it would be a strong indication that dust and gas in the host galaxy is indeed responsible for the appearance of an agn as a low - scattering object .",
    "the host hydrogen column densities of the order of @xmath122 required to produce the soft x - ray - deficient spectra would provide ample obscuration in the optical . for typical ism gas and dust composition , a conversion of column density to dust optical depth is found as @xmath123 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , meaning we could expect @xmath124 of the order of several 10s .",
    "if the emission from the nlr is predominantly originating from its innermost regions ( few parsec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these values are probably sufficient to extinct most of the high - ionization lines .",
    "in fact , the expected @xmath124 corresponds to a silicate optical depth @xmath8 of order unity and , therefore , being in line with the observed absorption features that are interpreted as arising from cool dust ( see also discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our goal was to study agn that have been identified in x - ray surveys for their very low observed soft - x - ray scattering fraction @xmath125% . based on x - ray modeling , these `` x - ray new - type '' , or * `` low - scattering '' *",
    "objects are supposedly buried in a dusty torus that has a very small opening angle .",
    "this would result in a small solid angle available for x - rays escaping from the agn environment .",
    "in particular , we addressed if the galaxies that host these sources show any preferred characteristics , and if we can find any evidence for this scenario in the ir radiation of these sources .",
    "the main conclusions from our study are :    * we find evidence that low - scattering agn are preferentially hosted in edge - on galaxies or mergers .",
    "most strikingly , while for a random host orientation we would expect 17% of galaxies having inclination @xmath126 , the low - scattering sample show these high inclinations at a frequency of 50% . in such systems",
    ", it is very likely that dust and gas in the host galaxy intersects with our line - of - sight to the nucleus .",
    "* by comparing the x - ray and ir emission , we did not find any evidence that the dust covering factors in the low - scattering agn in our sample are any different than in seyfert nuclei that have the same x - ray column density .",
    "* we also found that the observed @xmath48 silicate absorption features and mid - ir spectral indices of low - scattering objects cover about the same range as other type 2 agn . * for one low - scattering object ,",
    "eso  103g35 , we were able to determine several physical properties of the dust .",
    "we found a ( bolometric ) covering factor @xmath127 . while this direct determination of a covering factor based on incident and reemitted radiation could be a useful test for the low - scattering picture",
    ", the errors do not allow to put tight constraints on the covering factor in this case .",
    "we conclude , however , that the ir emission originates from warm dust with a mass of @xmath128 at a distance of about 13pc from the agn , consistent with a dusty torus or other circumnuclear dust distributions discussed in literature .",
    "the observed silicate absorption feature suggests additional absorption by cold dust ( temperature @xmath129k ) in the host galaxy , constrained to have @xmath91 of the order of @xmath130@xmath5 and being consistent with the high inclination of the host galaxy .    in summary ,",
    "our results imply that in the present sample the high inclinations of the host galaxies is the major difference between low - scattering agn and other seyfert galaxies that cover the same parameter space of agn luminosity , line - of - sight column densities , or ir reemission .",
    "this suggests that absorption in the host galaxy plays an important role in shaping the appearance of an obscured agn as a low - scattering object .",
    "we present an x - ray model that qualitatively reproduces the low perceived x - ray scattering @xmath125% , invoking standard x - ray emission properties of a type 2 agn plus host galaxy absorption .",
    "we strongly encourage to test this scenario in future modeling of larger samples of low - scattering objects , e.g. using the bat 70 month sample @xcite once spectral modeling results are available .",
    "we have not completely ruled out the hypothesis that individual low - scattering agn have unusually high covering factors .",
    "support for such a scenario may arise if , in addition to the peculiar x - ray spectrum , the agn is hosted in an early - type galaxy that is generically devoid of dust ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in such cases , it would be more difficult to imagine host dust to contribute toward absorption significantly . however , the objects we investigated in this study are radio - quiet seyfert galaxies mostly in spiral / disk galaxies or mergers that do contain large amounts of dust . therefore we showed that a low x - ray scattering fraction is not a sufficient condition to conclude that these objects have generically high covering factors .",
