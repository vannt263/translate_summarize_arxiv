    "heavy flavour hadrons consist of a heavy quark @xmath7 and a cloud of light quarks and gluons . since the early days of qcd it has been known that",
    ", in the limit of infinite mass @xmath8 , the total decay rates and lifetimes of weakly decaying particles containing the same flavour @xmath7 should be identical and equal to that of a `` free '' heavy decay , the effect of the bound state being neglected in calculating the decay probability .",
    "this nave intuition is contradicted by the experimental measurements of the charm family lifetimes , which manifest wide disparity between mesons and baryons ( roughly a factor of 10 between @xmath4 and @xmath9 ) and a significant difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( roughly a factor of 2 ) .",
    "this picture indicates that preasymptotic corrections , due to interactions with soft degrees of freedom in the light cloud , can not thus be disregarded at the charm - mass scale ; the inclusion of bound - state effects generates non - perturbative power corrections in @xmath11 . moreover , the presently available precise measurements of the ratio @xmath12 and of the inclusive branching ratios @xmath13 ( pdg94 ) and @xmath14 ( cleo ) lead to an estimate of almost equal semileptonic decay widths for the @xmath10 and @xmath9 : @xmath15 revealing that the extra rate in the total decay widths has to be looked for in the hadronic sector and that qcd corrections have to be taken into account .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the lifetime differences in charmed mesons should be understood at the level of two - body decays ; recent results on dalitz plot analyses indicate that the high - multiplicity decays are dominated by resonant substructures , the only exception being @xmath16 , which , alone among the @xmath0 decays already analyzed , can not be described without a large three - body non - resonant component .",
    "preasymptotic effects in the meson sector enter in the form of @xmath17-exchange and @xmath17-annihilation diagrams , correcting the nave spectator scenario ; additional contributions come from pauli interference of the decay quark and spectator quarks in the @xmath9 only , lengthening the lifetime of the @xmath9 with respect to the @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to the main spectator decay , the evaluation of both these effects requires a knowledge of the @xmath0 wave function .",
    "@xmath17-exchange and annihilation are expected to be inhibited by helicity conservation although soft gluon emission would attenuate the suppression .",
    "quantitative estimates of both gluon enhancement and non - spectator contributions are difficult and subject to uncertainty .",
    "anyway , the inclusion of these effects can account for the experimentally observed hierarchy : @xmath18 the @xmath19 decay represents a unique window to evaluate the annihilation rate .",
    "a dalitz - plot analysis of this channel allows the separation of components that only proceed through annihilation : namely , the three - body non - resonant and , in the absence of hostile final - state interactions , the @xmath20 contributions .",
    "analogously , the baryon sector manifests preasymptotic effects in the form of quark interference and @xmath17-exchange .",
    "the essential difference from the meson case , however , lies in the fact that @xmath17-exchange among valence quarks of the baryon is neither helicity nor colour suppressed .",
    "moreover , soft - gluon radiation , the crucial question in meson decays , is a mere correction to the pure valence - quark process .",
    "baryons are thus an ideal laboratory for studying preasymptotic effects ; they also offer the advantage of access to four states whose different quark structure implies different combinations of @xmath17-exchange and interference of different strengths .",
    "the relative size of these effects leads to different predictions  @xcite : @xmath21 the hierarchy - pattern ends are due to the absence of @xmath17-exchange for the @xmath5 and to large positive interference among @xmath22 quarks in the @xmath23 .",
    "previous analyses have recently been revisited and improved  @xcite , concluding that the @xmath23 could be either the shortest or longest living among the weakly decaying baryons depending on the strength of the spin - spin interaction and the value of the @xmath0 decay constant .",
    "an evaluation of the different effects can also be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the meson sector",
    "the ratio @xmath24 is measured to 1.7% ; the destructive interference invoked between @xmath9 external and internal spectator diagrams can account for this factor 2 difference .",
    "the lifetime ratio , @xmath25 , is also now measured to good accuracy ( 3.7% ) and turns out to deviate from the predicted value of unity at the @xmath26 level , thus raising the question of whether theoretical estimates can accomodate this difference .",
    "precise information on this ratio provides a sensitive gauge of the impact of weak annihilation in charm decays and of the weight of @xmath27 breaking .    in the baryon sector",
    "different hierarchy patterns are predicted ; they reflect intimate features of hadronic structure and are to a large extent model independent ; _ i.e. _ , they do not require a knowledge of the @xmath28 baryon wave - function .",
    "thus , fairly accurate measurements would permit disentangling and determining the individual spectator and non - spectator effects .",
    "once established , the observed hierarchy would imply relations between hadronic matrix elements of the operators involved , unique information otherwise inaccessible .",
    "unfortunately , in the baryon case we do not have the powerful tool of factorization ( applicable to mesons ) . from this point of view",
    ", experimental information is necessary to probe our understanding of weak - decay dynamics at preasymptotic scales .",
    "it should not be forgotten that the qcd - based inclusive approach will never become fully quantitative in the charmed family ; the @xmath29-quark lies below or at the border of the domain where the heavy - mass expansion may be useful , which makes the task challenging .",
    "the enhanced rle of preasymptotic effects leads to the necessity of carefully considering all operators to be included in the matrix elements : some updated analyses are now being produced  @xcite .",
    "the theory issue then concerns the size of the lifetime differences and absolute lifetime predictions .",
    "the measurement of the doubly strange @xmath23 baryon lifetime has turned out to be crucial ; here strong spin terms , as in the mesons , are present and the conjecture of an unknown mechanism ( distinguishing between mesons and antitriplet baryons ) somehow connected with the spin terms can be tested .",
    "the experimental scenario is chronologically portrayed in tables [ tab : dlife ] and [ tab : lcolife ] .",

    "progress from e687/e831 , wa89 and excharm is expected soon .",
    "on the theory side , efforts to develop systematic and self - consistent theoretical treatments of the inclusive weak decays of heavy flavour hadrons have been made .",
    "hopefully , the cooperation between different _ second generation technology _ analyses ( qcd sum rules , hqet , @xmath75 expansion , lattice qcd _ etc . _ ) will be fruitful .",
    "charm lifetime studies are providing very useful information on perturbative and non - perturbative qcd effects , necessary to understand the phenomenology of the lightest of the heavy quarks ; results on the charm family may therefore be important for predictions in the beauty sector and , hopefully , help illuminate the light quark world ."
