    "cerhin@xmath2 , an antiferromagnet with neel temperature @xmath22 = 3.8  k , shows ambient pressure superconductivity at very low temperatures , @xmath23 0.1  k @xcite and with the same value of @xmath23 2.5  k as cecoin@xmath2 under pressure of 2 gpa @xcite .",
    "magnetic order can be induced in the superconducting members by cd and hg substitutions of in @xcite , so that phase diagrams with rich interplay of magnetism , quantum critical points ( qcp ) at @xmath24 @xcite and superconductivity are found as functions of pressure and composition ( see refs . for reviews ) .",
    "doping studies found that ceirin@xmath2 @xcite , similar to cecoin@xmath2 @xcite , also lies in the vicinity of the magnetic quantum critical point , and thus its superconductivity is most likely magnetically mediated .",
    "our studies of thermal conductivity in both cecoin@xmath2 @xcite and ceirin@xmath2 @xcite , though , found significant deviations from simple @xmath25-wave scenario , supported by many experiments @xcite .    magnetic field can also be used as the non - thermal tuning parameter for quantum critical point , and in cecoin@xmath2 field - tuned qcp is mysteriously coinciding with the superconducting upper critical field for orientations of magnetic field along both @xmath3-axis @xcite and @xmath26-plane @xcite of the tetragonal crystals .",
    "the existence of qcp is reflected in anomalous temperature dependences of electrical resistivity @xcite closely following @xmath27-linear dependence , of the specific heat showing logarithmic divergence , in band - dependent divergence of cyclotron effective masses @xcite and directional violation of wiedemann - franz law @xcite .    in cerhin@xmath2 field - induced magnetic order",

    "is the question if field tuned quantum criticality can be found in ceirin@xmath2 .",
    "the two materials , cecoin@xmath2 and ceirin@xmath2 , have identical fermi surfaces @xcite and show very similar normal state properties @xcite , so it is natural to expect similarity in response to magnetic field .",
    "despite this apparent similarity , heat capacity measurements @xcite do not indicate critical behavior near bulk upper critical field , finding nearly temperature - independent @xmath31 at the lowest temperatures . instead",
    ", heat capacity , torque and resistivity studies suggest that ceirin@xmath2 shows metamagnetic transition with critical field of 25  t , far above superconducting @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these studies , though , reveal several unusual features . while the electronic term @xmath32 in heat capacity saturates at constant value below @xmath33 0.8  k in magnetic field of 1  t and",
    "remains nearly constant with magnetic field @xmath34 in 1  t to 17  t range , with @xmath35 0.7 to 0.8 j / mole k@xmath36 @xcite , deviations from this value at high fields start at progressively lower @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "another study suggested that the superconducting dome of ceirin@xmath2 is located inside the dome of precursor phase , similar to pseudogap state in the high @xmath20 cuprates @xcite , suppressed at a field of 6  t.    we should keep in mind though that resistivity studies in ceirin@xmath2 can not probe the region close to bulk @xmath4 , hidden inside the domain of filamentary superconductivity @xcite .",
    "subtraction of schottky anomaly in heat capacity measurements always leaves some uncertainty in the behavior at the lowest temperatures . to get an additional insight into response of ceirin@xmath2 to application of magnetic field ,",
    "here we report field evolution of the electronic transport properties of ceirin@xmath2 using simultaneous electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements , with the latter allowing to probe the range of filamentary superconductivity close to bulk @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the wiedemann - franz law is universally obeyed in @xmath38  0 limit for all fields where resistivity measurements are not affected by filamentary superconductivity , proving true bulk nature of both electrical and heat transport .",
    "for all fields above bulk @xmath4 we observe a fermi - liquid temperature dependence of thermal resistivity , @xmath39 , slightly decreasing with field @xmath16 coefficient and nearly field - independent @xmath37 .",
    "notably smaller values of @xmath16 in ceirin@xmath2 when compared to cecoin@xmath2 , as well as their very mild dependence on magnetic field , suggest that ceirin@xmath2 is significantly further away from magnetic instability at @xmath4 and the field tuned criticality is significantly different in the two materials .",
    "we link this difference to anomalously low value of kadowaki - woods ratio of the @xmath40 coefficient in electrical resistivity versus @xmath41 coefficient of the specific heat .",
    "this suggests more localized character of magnetism in ceirin@xmath2 than in cecoin@xmath2 .",
    "single crystals of ceirin@xmath2 were grown using self - flux method @xcite .",

    "four contacts to the samples were made by soldering 50 @xmath45 silver wires with indium solder , which resulted in the contact resistance typically @xmath46  m@xmath47 at low temperature .",
    "same contacts were used to measure electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity in a dilution refrigerator , thus essentially eliminating uncertainty of the geometric factor determination .",
    "the thermal conductivity was measured using a standard four - probe steady - state method with two ruo@xmath29 chip thermometers calibrated _ in situ _ against a reference ge thermometer .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured using lr700 ac resistance bridge , operating at a frequency of 16 hz , by applying 0.1 ma excitation currents . to enable low - noise measurements of low resistance samples in identical conditions with thermal conductivity studies ,",
    "measurements were performed in a separate dilution refrigerator run , during which the high - resistance wire coils of the thermal conductivity apparatus were temporary shorted with silver wires , see ref .   for details .    the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity , @xmath48 , was determined from electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements in heavily disordered samples of ce@xmath49la@xmath50irin@xmath2 with @xmath51=0.2 and residual resistivity @xmath52 cm , see ref .   for details . in these",

[ fig : resistivity ] we plot temperature - dependent resistivity of ceirin@xmath2 measured in magnetic fields of 0 , 3.15 , 3.6 , 4 , 8 , 11 t applied along the tetragonal @xmath3-axis ( top left panel ) . in zero field , the filamentary superconductivity is observed below @xmath55 1.2  k , the resistive transition is completely suppressed in field of 4  t. the filamentary superconductivity was shown to have the same angular dependence of @xmath4 as the bulk one @xcite and suggested to originate from strain in the samples , likely induced by inclusions of different phase @xcite .",
    "similar phenomenon is known in sr@xmath29ruo@xmath56 in which superconductivity with higher @xmath20 is induced by inclusions of ru - metal @xcite and in some other materials including chain nb@xmath29se@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 dependences at temperatures above 1  k are very similar for all magnetic fields .",
    "they clearly deviate from the functional form expected in fermi - liquid theory , @xmath59 .",
    "the residual electrical resistivity , @xmath60 , of the samples was determined from measurements down to 40 mk in the magnetic field of 4  t , which was sufficient to completely suppress filamentary superconductivity .",
    "it was about @xmath61  cm , showing high purity of the samples .",

    "[ fig : resistivity ] suggests extrapolation of @xmath37 to finite values in @xmath72 limit , suggesting non - existence of the field - tuned quantum critical point at @xmath4 or even in zero field . however , significant error bars of @xmath37 determination make this extrapolation from field 4  t unreliable towards bulk @xmath4 .    to get additional insight into the magnetic field - induced evolution of the normal state in ceirin@xmath2",

    "as can be seen from 0.52  t curve , the @xmath75 vs @xmath27 plot does not show any features on entering filamentary zero resistance state below approximately 1.0  k ( not shown ) , leading to artificial violation of wiedemann - franz law . as long as filamentary superconductivity is suppressed ,",

    "observation of very strong @xmath58 dependence at so low temperatures ( where phonon scattering becomes negligible but the strength of inelastic scattering , @xmath87 @xmath88 cm , is significantly larger than @xmath89 @xmath90 cm ) suggests strong magnetic scattering in the compound , similar to cecoin@xmath2 @xcite .",

    "temperature - dependent part of electronic thermal resistivity obeys the same functional dependence as electrical resistivity , however , because of the different fermi surface integrals of heat and charge scatterings , the @xmath40 coefficients @xmath17 for resistivity and @xmath16 for thermal resistivity are not the same .",

    "@xcite we noticed that the most heavy electrons are strongly bound in the superconducting condensate . in this case the big difference in the strength of electron - electron renormalization between cecoin@xmath2 and ceirin@xmath2 , can be directly linked to five times difference in the value of the superconducting @xmath20 .",

    "we can speculate that orbital limiting of @xmath4 observed in ceirin@xmath2 in configuration @xmath34 can be responsible for the lack of coincident quantum critical point .",
    "summarizing , we neither find field - tuned quantum critical point at bulk @xmath4 in ceirin@xmath2 , nor see indications of its existence in all range of magnetic fields studied ( up to 11  t ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to cecoin@xmath2 , suggesting that ceirin@xmath2 is significantly further away from qcp .",

    "both materials have similar @xmath105 values above @xmath20 , somewhat higher in ceinin@xmath2 . big difference in @xmath17 coefficients",
    "suggests that the kadowaki - woods ratio , defined as @xmath106 , is anomalously low in ceirin@xmath2 .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",

    ", for instance , this ratio is about 0.52 @xmath108 at @xmath110 that falls on the universal line for some other heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "the kadowaki - woods ratio cancels out mass renormalization in electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements and leads to scaling of @xmath17 and @xmath111 proportional to level degeneracy of @xmath19-electrons @xcite .",
    "ce ions in cecoin@xmath2 and ceirin@xmath2 are in the same crystal field environment , so it is natural to take the same value @xmath65=2 . while the @xmath112 for cecoin@xmath2 has a value typical for heavy fermion materials , it is anomalously low in ceirin@xmath2 .",
    "anomalously low value of kadowaki - woods ratio in ceirin@xmath2 suggests that not the same groups of carriers are determining the electrical resistivity and the heat capacity of the samples .",
    "two scenarios can be at play . in the first one , conduction electrons are strongly disconnected from @xmath19-electrons due to localized character of the latter . in this case",
    "similar values of heat capacity in cecoin@xmath2 and ceirin@xmath2 reflect nearly identical @xmath19-electron contribution , but their significantly more localized character in ceirin@xmath2 . in the second scenario ,",
    "we need to assume significant difference of properties of different groups of carriers on the multi - band fermi surface of the materials",
    ". this scenario would require the presence of light and mobile carriers dominating in the electrical transport and heavy carriers dominating the heat capacity .",
    "one possible way to distinguish these two scenarios is to study magnetoresistance . in the latter scenario",
    "the magnetoresistance of ceirin@xmath2 should be significantly larger than in cecoin@xmath2 .",
