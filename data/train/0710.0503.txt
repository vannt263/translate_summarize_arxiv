    "<S> spectral approach to the charge carrier transport in @xmath0-junctions has allowed us to revise the theoretical results relating to large signal operation of the junction to make them valid for both the low and high frequencies ranges . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral composition of the external circuit current includes both the dc and ac components . </S>",
    "<S> the former produces the static current  voltage characteristic with the modified bessel function of zeroth order , @xmath1 , while the latter yields the dynamic admittance with the modified bessel function of first order , @xmath2 , either of them depend on the signal amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results are consistent with the theoretical ones if a fitting parameter allowing for recombination processes in the depletion layer is taken into account . </S>"
