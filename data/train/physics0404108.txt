    "most turbulent flows are anisotropic at large scales .",
    "homogeneous shear flow represents one of the simplest anisotropic flows and its study can reveal important aspects of the structure and production of the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the high reynolds number experiment of shen and warhaft  @xcite indicates that the higher odd order moments of the velocity derivatives may not be consistent with the postulate of local isotropy , which requires that the normalized odd order transverse derivative moments approach zero at large reynolds numbers .",
    "this finding has important consequences , since this postulate has been central for turbulence theories and models .",
    "@xcite although dns at high reynolds numbers are not feasible yet , persistent anisotropy in the skewness of velocity derivatives has been observed earlier in the numerical results of pumir ,  @xcite also confirmed by schumacher .",
    "@xcite    the assumption of local isotropy also requires relations between the even order transverse derivative moments , which should satisfy @xmath0 , and similar relations for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is experimental evidence that the second order transverse derivative moments are not isotropic , especially when the mean rate of strain is significant .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the anisotropy of the higher even order transverse moments of the velocity derivatives has not been examined . in this study",
    "we point out a lack of isotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments in homogeneous shear flow for both incompressible and compressible cases with increased anisotropy for higher order moments .",
    "we also show that the small scale dilatational motions are more anisotropic than their solenoidal counterparts , so that the anisotropy increases for the compressible case . moreover ,",
    "the anisotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments found in the dns results is predicted by the rdt solutions . as the reynolds number increases",
    ", the anisotropy among the transverse derivative moments is expected to decrease . since it is shown that the anisotropy increases with the order of the moment",
    ", some anisotropy may persist for higher order moments at large values of the reynolds number .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the linear analysis predicts that the normalized odd order transverse derivative moments of @xmath3 should approach a constant different than zero at large times , in agreement with the dns data .",
    "the rdt results suggest a persistent anisotropy of the higher odd order normalized transverse derivative moments at large reynolds number , in agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "@xcite    there are numerous experimental investigations of incompressible homogeneous shear flow ,  @xcite however , no such study exists for the compressible case .",
    "compressibility effects in turbulent flows are important in many practical applications ranging from combustion processes , to high speed aerodynamics , and to astrophysical phenomena .",
    "although compressible turbulence has been the subject of intense research in the last 50 years , much less is known in comparison with incompressible turbulence .",
    "@xcite in order to isolate the volume changes of the fluid elements , the velocity field is usually decomposed into a solenoidal ( divergence free ) part and a dilatational part . for homogeneous flows",
    "this decomposition is unique up to an additive constant , which can be taken to be zero without the loss of generality .",
    "such decomposition in spectral space has been exploited by rapid distortion theories in studies of shock - turbulence interaction and homogeneous turbulence subject to bulk compression or uniform mean shear .",
    "@xcite    for the rdt equations of incompressible homogeneous shear flow , analytical solutions in wavenumber space are known for the velocity field in both viscous and inviscid cases .",
    "@xcite the integration of these solutions over the wavenumber space can yield predictions for various quantities in real space .",
    "in general , only for very early and long times the integrals can be evaluated analytically .",
    "long time solutions for the velocity variances and shear stress are obtained by moffatt  @xcite and rogers .",
    "@xcite the early time evolution of the flow is correctly captured by the rdt equations since the non - normal amplification mechanism is linear in time .",
    "@xcite however , due to the neglecting of the nonlinear terms and thus the energy cascade to small scales , the rdt predictions can become eventually very different than those of the full nonlinear equations .",
    "nevertheless , for the incompressible case , the rdt equations correctly capture the behavior of various correlations coefficients in the fully developed flow field .",
    "@xcite    for the case of compressible homogeneous shear flow in the rdt limit no analytical solutions are known .",
    "simone  @xcite performed rdt simulations of homogeneous shear flow and showed that the role of the distortion mach number , @xmath4 , on the time variation of the turbulent kinetic energy is consistent with that found in the dns results .",
    "they also identified different time regimes in which the various contributions to the terms in the rdt equations in spectral space change qualitatively , which might be the reason for the difference in the early and long time influence of @xmath4 on the kinetic energy growth .",
    "however , in the absence of analytical solutions , it is difficult to predict how each wavenumber will affect the result of the integration over the wavenumber space .",
    "for example , for the incompressible case , rogers  @xcite shows that at long times most of the contribution to the velocity variances and shear stress comes from a very narrow region in wavenumber space , which shrinks in time .",
    "the dns results for compressible homogeneous shear flow of blaisdell  @xcite and livescu  @xcite reveal that the explicit dilatational effects tend to occur predominantly in the direction of the shear .",
    "livescu and madnia  @xcite examined the anisotropies of the solenoidal and dilatational motions for different values of the reynolds and turbulent mach numbers and found higher levels of anisotropy for the normal components of the dilatational dissipation tensor compared with those of the normal components of the solenoidal dissipation tensor . by examining the energy transfer leading to the anisotropy of the dilatational motions , livescu  @xcite showed that the nonlinear terms in the transport equation for the kinetic energy components do not have a significant contribution .",
    "this suggests that a linear mechanism might be responsible for the amplification of the dilatational motions in the direction of the shear .",
    "the present study thus aims : ( i ) to point out a lack of isotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments for both compressible and incompressible cases and show that this anisotropy is due to a linear mechanism , ( ii ) to examine the ability of the linearized equations to predict the persistent anisotropy of the normalized odd order transverse derivative moments found in the experimental data , and ( iii ) to clarify if the amplification of the dilatational kinetic energy and dilatational dissipation in the direction of the shear are also due to a linear mechanism .",
    "moreover , the different levels of anisotropy of the small scale dilatational and solenoidal motions for the compressible case is also discussed .",
    "additionally , analytical solutions are presented for the rdt equations of compressible homogeneous turbulent shear flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the governing equations and their linearization in the rdt limit .",
    "the numerical methodology for solving the full nonlinear and the rdt equations with the parameters for the cases considered is presented in section iii .",
    "section iv contains an analysis of the rdt equations for compressible homogeneous shear flow .",

    "analytical solutions are presented for the fourier modes of pressure and velocity components . in section",
    "v the analytical and numerical solutions of the rdt equations are compared with the dns results .",
    "it is shown that the amplification of the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the shear and the anisotropy of the normal components of the dilatational dissipation tensor are captured by the rdt equations .",
    "also in this section , the anisotropy of the even and odd order transverse derivative moments of the solenoidal and dilatational velocity fields for the compressible case and of the velocity field for the incompressible case are studied using dns results and shown to be predicted by the rdt analysis .",

    "the coordinate transformation matrix has constant diagonal components @xmath25 and the only off - diagonal nonzero component is @xmath26 .",

    "the reference viscosity , @xmath39 , and thermal diffusivity , @xmath40 , are assumed to be proportional to @xmath41 .    for the incompressible case ,",
    "the energy equation is eliminated , the continuity equation is replaced by the incompressibility constraint , and the molecular viscosity is constant .",
    "the governing equations become    @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 are the velocity fluctuations and @xmath45 .",
    "the linearized nondimensional equations of motion for density , @xmath46 , velocity , @xmath21 , and pressure , @xmath47 , fluctuations in a compressible homogeneous turbulent flow are derived by kovasznay .",

    ", the linearized equations become    @xmath48    while the average density is constant in time for homogeneous shear flow , the linearized equation for the mean pressure is    @xmath49    with the right hand side of the equation given by viscous dissipation of the mean flow .",
    "although in general the linearized equations form a coupled system of equations , for the inviscid case they can be decoupled ( note that in this case the mean pressure becomes constant ) .",
    "thus , an equation for the dilatation can be obtained by taking the divergence of eq .",

    "( [ p2 ] ) , since @xmath69 ( note that the initial value of the turbulent kinetic energy is @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "moreover , if the distortion mach number ,  @xcite @xmath72 , is introduced , then @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the initial value of the distortion mach number and @xmath75 is the initial value of the integral scale @xmath76 .",

    "the inviscid linearized theory predicts the existence of only one compressibility parameter , @xmath79 , for the properly scaled variables .",
    "however , the addition of either the nonlinear or the viscous terms prevents the governing equations to be written in terms of only one compressibility parameter .",
    "therefore , for moderate values of @xmath9 or reynolds number , two independent compressibility parameters can be defined .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by simone ,  @xcite changes in @xmath74 at constant @xmath95 are more important to the growth of turbulent kinetic energy than changes in @xmath95 at constant @xmath74 .",

    "the initial pressure fluctuations are evaluated from a poisson equation , the initial density field is uniform , and the initial value of the mean pressure is calculated from the mean equation of state . the numerical method , mesh size and initial conditions for pressure and velocity fields are the same for the incompressible case .",
    "several cases , 1 to 5 , are considered at different values of the mean shear rate . for each case two simulations , one compressible and one incompressible , are performed .",
    "table i presents the relevant information for each of the cases considered .",
    "the initial nondimensional shear rate is defined as @xmath102 . for the compressible cases , the distortion mach number @xmath74 is also listed .",
    "cases 1 to 5 have the initial value of the taylor reynolds number @xmath103 and it increases to @xmath104 at the end of the simulations .",

    "all simulations were monitored to ensure that the integral scales remain small compared to the box size and the kolmogorov microscale is larger than the grid size .",
    "the compressible runs were also repeated with initial turbulent mach numbers ranging from @xmath106 to @xmath107 and all the results presented in the next sections remained qualitatively unchanged .    based on the magnitude of the shear rate , a simple scaling argument can be used to characterize the relative importance of the nonlinear term in the momentum equations compared to the linear term arising from the presence of the nonzero mean velocity gradient .",
    "thus , as shown in ref .  , the nonlinear term is negligible when @xmath108 and dominates when @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 , with @xmath112 .",

    "the results obtained for the cases with different values of the mean shear rate become close , while retaining the dependence on the initial reynolds number .",

    "a fourth order runge - kutta scheme is employed for the time advancement .",
    "the equations are also solved for the incompressible case ( which is recovered by letting @xmath130 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the system [ g1]-[g5 ] is independent of the initial spectra , so that it is solved only once for a particular set of parameters .",

    "for each case , both the inviscid and viscous equations are solved .",
    "the types of initial conditions considered are not exhaustive for the initial conditions used in dns of compressible turbulence ( e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite for decaying isotropic turbulence ) .",
    "however , they were chosen such that the role of a nonzero initial dilatational field can be isolated . in the next sections ,",
    "the numerical solutions of the rdt equations are compared with the dns results and with the analytical predictions .",
    "by examining eq . ( [ p2 ] ) for the pressure mode",

    "therefore , in the outer region , for large times , @xmath225 and @xmath226 become constant .",
    "numerical solutions of the rdt equations indicate that the contributions from the inner region to @xmath220 and @xmath221 remain dominant for the compressible case and @xmath230 and @xmath231 increase in time , as shown in fig .",
    "however , as the compressibility parameter @xmath7 increases , these contributions decrease their importance resulting in a reduced rate of increase of the turbulent kinetic energy in @xmath148 and @xmath232 directions .",
    "this explains the `` stabilizing '' effect of compressibility on the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy found in the rdt study of simone .",
    "@xcite    from the solution corresponding to the fourier mode of the dilatation , the dilatational parts of the velocity modes can be obtained as @xmath233 .",

    "although the early time response of the flow to the presence of the shear is correctly captured by the linearized equations , the long time evolution of the flow can become very different than that obtained from the full nonlinear equations",

    "@xcite    it is shown below that other characteristics of the dilatational field are captured by the linearized equations . in particular , it is shown that the amplification of the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the shear and the anisotropy of the normal components of the dilatational dissipation rate tensor are captured by the rdt equations .",
    "furthermore , dns results show that the transverse even order derivative moments of the velocity field in both compressible and incompressible cases are anisotropic and the anisotropy increases with the order of the moment .",

    "it is obtained that most of the dilatational kinetic energy resides in the direction of the mean velocity gradient , consistent with the numerical solution of the linearized eqs .",
    "( [ colin])-([enlin ] ) ( fig .",
    "the addition of the viscous terms decreases the dominance of @xmath239 component compared to the other two components , as can be seen in fig .",

    "5(c ) shows , the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the mean velocity gradient obtained in dns is larger than in the other two directions , in agreement with the previous studies .",
    "@xcite the above analysis indicates that the amplification of the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the mean shear can be explained by linear effects .",
    "previous numerical simulations of compressible homogeneous shear flow  @xcite indicate that the dilatational dissipation rate tensor behaves very differently than its solenoidal counterpart .",
    "thus , the dilatational dissipation rate is amplified in the direction of the mean shear .",
    "this behavior was previously attributed to the formation of shocklets aligned preferentially in @xmath88 direction .",
    "livescu and madnia  @xcite performed simulations at different values of the turbulent mach number and obtained no significant decrease in the anisotropy of the dilatational dissipation rate tensor in low turbulent mach number simulations . therefore , the amplification of the dilatational dissipation rate in the direction of the mean shear is not associated with the presence of shocklets .",
    "this conclusion is also obtained in ref .  .",
    "figure 6 shows that @xmath240 becomes more important compared to @xmath241 and @xmath242 as @xmath7 , which is proportional to the distortion mach number , increases . after multiplying the solutions for the dilatational velocity modes ( eqs .",

    "numerical solutions of the rdt equations in both inviscid and viscous cases confirm this result .",
    "therefore , the anisotropy of the normal components of the dilatational dissipation rate tensor can be associated with a linear mechanism .      in the outer region",
    "@xmath64 increases continuously , while it is very small in the inner region ( where @xmath247 ) . using the solutions provided in the previous section for the solenoidal and dilatational components of the velocities",
    ", it can be shown that after the multiplication by @xmath64 , the contribution from the outer region becomes dominant at long times . therefore",
    ", the @xmath88 derivatives of the velocity components become much larger than the derivatives in the other two directions . as a result ,",
    "all the even order derivative statistics involving @xmath88 derivatives become amplified and this effect is more pronounced for higher order statistics .",
    "figure 7 compares moments of the transverse derivatives , @xmath248 where @xmath249 and @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , of the dilatational velocity in @xmath148 direction .",
    "it can be seen that , as the distortion mach number increases and the rdt limit is approached , the moments containing @xmath88 derivatives become much larger than the corresponding @xmath232 derivative statistics . moreover , in agreement with the rdt predictions , this anisotropy is strongly amplified for higher order moments .",
    "this again suggests that the small scale anisotropy of the dilatational motions found in the dns results is produced by a linear mechanism . on the other hand , the results presented show that the higher order transverse moments are increasingly more anisotropic as the order of the moment increases .",
    "thus , even if the anisotropy decreases with reynolds number , some degree of anisotropy will persist for higher order transverse derivative moments at large values of the reynolds number .",
    "although the inner region has a significant contribution to the one - point statistics of the solenoidal velocity components in @xmath148 and @xmath232 directions , this contribution becomes negligible for the statistics involving @xmath88 derivatives .",
    "as explained above , in the outer region @xmath253 and @xmath254 become constant at large times so that after the multiplication with @xmath64 they increase linearly .",
    "therefore , the outer region yields a quadratic increase in time for @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "the contribution from the inner region does not increase after the multiplication with @xmath64 and the inner region yields a less than quadratic increase for the above quantities .",
    "similar results are obtained for higher order moments .",
    "thus , similar to the dilatational velocities , in the rdt limit the even order transverse derivatives of the solenoidal velocities in @xmath148 and @xmath232 directions are anisotropic and become even more anisotropic as the order of the statistics increases .",
    "figure 8 confirms that this effect is also present in the dns results for the derivative moments of @xmath257 and similar results are obtained for the derivative moments of @xmath258 .    a comparison between figs .",
    "7 and 8 indicates that the transverse solenoidal derivative moments are less anisotropic than their dilatational counterparts .",
    "again , it can be shown that this is also in agreement with the rdt predictions .",
    "thus , since @xmath253 becomes constant in the outer region , it yields that @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "however , the @xmath232 derivative retains influence mostly from the inner region and @xmath261 . on the other hand @xmath262 retains influence mostly from the outer region . the riemann - lebesgue theorem can be used to integrate formula [ linu1 ] multiplied by @xmath64 and @xmath263 to obtain for the dilatational component that @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "similar results are obtained for higher order statistics .",
    "therefore , in the rdt limit , the even order transverse derivatives of the @xmath266 are more anisotropic than their solenoidal counterparts for large but finite values of @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "similar results are obtained for the velocity in @xmath232 direction .    using the same analysis as above",
    ", it can be shown that the odd order moments of the @xmath88 derivatives of @xmath257 also have most of the contributions from the outer regions .",
    "thus , after the multiplication with @xmath267 , the solution in the outer region becomes much larger than that obtained in the inner region as @xmath268 .",
    "note that @xmath269 increases in time as @xmath270 in the inner region and the multiplication by @xmath64 does not increase this rate .",
    "since in the outer region @xmath253 becomes constant at large times , it yields that the moment of order @xmath271 increases in time as @xmath272 , and , therefore , the normalized odd order moments , @xmath273^ { n/2}$ ] , with @xmath271 odd , should approach a constant different than zero at large times . as fig .",
    "10 shows , this prediction is in general agreement with the dns data .",
    "the same analysis can not be used for @xmath258 .",
    "it was shown that in the outer region @xmath254 approaches its initial value . therefore ,",
    "after multiplication by @xmath267 the odd order moments of the @xmath88 derivative , would approach values proportional to those of the initial odd order moments of the @xmath148 derivative .",

    "this is consistent with the overall symmetry of the problem , which requires that the odd order @xmath148 and @xmath88 moments of the @xmath2 velocity remain zero at all times .    for the incompressible case ,",

    "@xcite although most of the contributions to the velocity variances in @xmath148 and @xmath232 directions come from the inner region , it is easy to show that the statistics involving @xmath88 derivatives have contributions mostly from the outer region , where at large times @xmath274 .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the velocity modes in the outer region is similar to that obtained above for the solenoidal velocity modes . consequently , in the rdt limit the transverse even order moments of the velocity derivatives are anisotropic , and the anisotropy increases for higher order moments .",
    "similar to the solenoidal moments for the compressible case and consistent with the rdt predictions , the incompressible dns results presented in fig .",
    "11 show an increase in the anisotropy for higher order transverse derivatives moments of @xmath3 .",

    "the dns results are similar to those shown in fig .",
    "10 for the solenoidal velocity field in the compressible case and support the rdt prediction .",

    ", the postulate of local isotropy requires that the odd order transverse derivative moments should approach zero .",

    "<S> the amplification of the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the mean shear and the anisotropy of the dilatational dissipation tensor found in the dns results are also consistent with the rdt analysis . </S>"
