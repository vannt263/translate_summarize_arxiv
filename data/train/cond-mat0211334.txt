    "granular systems have been the focus of much attention due both to the theoretical challenges they present  @xcite and to the applications of industrial importance that stem from the rich phenomena they exhibit ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these systems are characterized by an energy loss in collisions , and this loss is at the base of many interesting phenomena . among these ,",
    "the clustering of particles has drawn much attention  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study in detail the mechanisms that dominate the collective dynamics of a one - dimensional system of point - like particles that interact via collisions that conserve momentum but dissipate kinetic energy .",
    "a cluster may or may not form .",
    "the system is confined in a box of unit length and any particle that reaches a wall is expelled from it with its velocity randomly chosen so that the velocity distribution of `` outgoing '' particles is a maxwellian distribution with the `` temperature '' of that wall",
    ". there are no external forces . in a previous article",
    "@xcite we saw that there are two relevant control parameters : the restitution coefficient which characterizes the collisions and the normalized temperature difference @xmath4 between the walls , @xmath5 . in the plane of these two parameters",
    "there is a _ transition line _ : on one side the system is a granular fluid that reaches a stationary regime while in the other side a cluster is formed and , apparently , no stationary solution can be reached , at least in the limit of infinitely many particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite we described what happens , while in the present paper we disclose the underlying mechanisms .",
    "two aspects have to be distinguished .",
    "on the one hand there is the formal aspect : we show that boltzmann s equation describes closely what we get from molecular dynamic simulations in the case of the pure fluid phase even quite close to the transition line . on the other",
    ", there is an intuitive picture  originated in our detailed integration of boltzmann s equation described in this paper  that we explain in the following paragraphs .    to fix notation , if  @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the velocities of two particles that are about to collide , their velocities after the collision are given by @xmath8 here @xmath9 , where  @xmath10 is the usual restitution coefficient .",
    "for the elastic case ( @xmath11 ) the particles simply exchange velocities . since the grains are point - like , the elastic case is then indistinguishable from a system in which the particles do not interact . to make this more explicit",
    ", the point - like character of the grains allows us to exchange their identities after the collision , giving the collision rules @xmath12 thus , when @xmath13 the velocities are unaffected , and when @xmath14 is small the velocities are only barely changed .",
    "this leaves us with the picture of a system of weakly interacting particles , whose relative velocity diminishes upon collisions .",
    "the one dimensional granular system is being excited from the two walls , generally at different temperatures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "particles emerging from the walls act as an outcoming `` wind '' pushing the particles away from them .",
    "one could picture the effect of this wind as an effective _ repulsive force _ which pushes the particles away from the walls .",
    "if the temperature difference between the two walls is large enough , the repulsive force associated to the hotter wall prevails over the force associated to the colder wall all across the system . therefore in this case",
    "the overall effect is a net force always pointing toward the colder wall , much like gravity acts in a gas , always pointing to the base .",
    "if , on the contrary , the temperature difference is not large enough , there is a point in the system where the two repulsive forces cancel each other , producing an equilibrium point  a particle at rest in this point would tend to remain at rest  about which a cluster will grow .",
    "as the cluster absorbs particles the density of the surrounding gas decreases , and the equilibrium point may shift in time .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equation ] we state the kinetic equation in the limit which the authors of ref .  @xcite call the _ hydrodynamic limit _ of the one - dimensional boltzmann equation for point - like grains .",
    "this limit is analogous to the boltzmann - grad limit of infinitely many particles and finite mean free path . in the present case ,",
    "the role of the inverse of the mean free path is played by the factor  @xmath15 , where @xmath16  is the number of particles , and  @xmath14 is the inelasticity factor mentioned above .",
    "this factor represents how much is the velocity of a fast test - particle affected by crossing the system , when the inelasticity  @xmath14 is very small  @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions and normalization used are also stated .",
    "section  [ sec : solution_algorithm ] focuses on the stationary state , and describes the algorithm devised for the kinetic equation in this case .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains results and conclusions .",
    "it compares the distribution functions in the one - particle phase space  @xmath17 ( where  @xmath18 is the spatial coordinate , and  @xmath19 is the velocity ) with the same distribution measured from molecular dynamic simulations .",
    "the numerical solution presents a discontinuity that stems from the limit taken in sec .",
    "[ sec : equation ] , which allows the equation to be treated as approximately linear .",
    "the measured distribution exhibits a softened version of the discontinuity that steepens as we consider systems with larger number of particles ( thus approximating better the limit of sec .",
    "[ sec : equation ] ) .",
    "an intuitive picture is finally put forward .",
    "in the limit @xmath20 , but keeping @xmath15 fixed , the one - dimensional boltzmann equation transforms into the test - particle equation  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 since the equation is nonlinear , we must define explicitly the normalization used . in this case",
    "it is @xmath23    the system is confined in a box of unit length , and the particles may have any velocity : @xmath24\\times ( -\\infty , \\infty)$ ] .",
    "any particle that reaches a wall is instantaneously expelled from it ",
    "there is no adsorption  with its velocity randomly chosen so that the velocity distribution of expelled particles is a gaussian distribution with the temperature of that wall .",
    "this corresponds to choosing a wall kernel without memory and without a delay time ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) : @xmath25 the temperatures at both walls are chosen so that the system temperature for the perfectly elastic case is @xmath26 .",
    "we will always take @xmath27 .",
    "the missing constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundary_conditions ] ) are determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : normalization ] ) and by imposing that there is no flow across the walls : @xmath28",
    "in a stationary situation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann_equation ] ) may be rewritten as follows : @xmath29 the coefficient @xmath30 multiplying @xmath31 plays the role of a force ( per unit mass ) and it is what we have called _ wind _ , in the introduction .",
    "it is the effective total force on a particle at @xmath18 with velocity @xmath19 . when @xmath32 is reasonably close to the true solution",
    ", @xmath33  will not depend on the detailed form of the distribution .",
    "thus , if we have a trial distribution  @xmath34 , we may consider @xmath33 and  @xmath35 as given functions of @xmath18 and  @xmath19 , and then we may solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : stationary_case ] ) for the distribution  @xmath36 . seen in this light , when the trial function is reasonably close to the solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stationary_case ] ) is approximately a linear partial differential equation that can be analyzed as a hyperbolic equation , using the notion of characteristic curves  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the characteristic curves satisfy @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a parameter .    in simple words ,",
    "our integro - differential equation is treated as if it were a ( quasi - linear ) partial differential equation and , since real characteristics exist , it is possible to integrate along these lines as if dealing with an ordinary differential equation with a single independent variable  @xmath38 .",
    "briefly put , given a distribution @xmath34 ( which implies that we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , we calculate @xmath36 by solving @xmath41 through numerical integration along the characteristics , following ref .",
    "@xcite . after the integration",
    "we normalize @xmath36 to one , and then use @xmath36 to calculate @xmath42 . in this way we eventually reach a fixed point .",
    "-space when the right wall is hotter than the left wall .",
    "subfigure ( a ) shows the case where the curve @xmath43 does not cross the @xmath44 line .",
    "subfigure ( b ) shows how a characteristic curve would wind around the point where the @xmath45 and @xmath44 lines cross .",
    "[ fig : coiling_characteristics ] ]    -space for the case where the @xmath45 curve crosses the @xmath44 line .",
    "[ fig : winding_characteristic_x_c_f ] ]    as will be described in detail in the following section , there are three types of characteristics : ( 1 ) those that originate at @xmath46 with a large positive velocity and end at @xmath47 ; ( 2 ) those that also begin at @xmath46 ( implying @xmath48 ) but do not reach @xmath47 : they reach the @xmath44 axis , turn around , and return to @xmath46 ; ( 3 ) those that start at @xmath47 ( implying @xmath49 ) and end at @xmath46 .",
    "the first two types of characteristics are associated to the left boundary condition , while the third type is associated to the right boundary condition .",
    "the solution , therefore , may be discontinuous along the separatrix of these last two types of characteristics . since our numerical algorithm integrates along these characteristics , it never crosses the discontinuity ; every step deals with a smooth function .    as in refs .  @xcite we may consider that the projection of any characteristic line to the @xmath50 plane corresponds to the phase - space trajectory of a _ test particle _ crossing the system . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dc_ds ] ) we confirm what has been said before , namely that @xmath51 is the acceleration of the particle . for large velocities @xmath52 , hence if the particle s velocity is large it will be slowed down .",
    "this is suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : coiling_characteristics](a ) , where the characteristics far from @xmath44 approach that axis .    due to the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dx_ds ] ) and  ( [ eq : dc_ds ] ) , the intersection of the curves @xmath44 and @xmath43 is interesting   asymptotically , we can be sure that there is at least one @xmath45 curve , and that if there is only one curve , then `` above '' it @xmath53 , and `` below '' it @xmath54 .",
    "therefore in this case @xmath55 at the intersection of @xmath45 and @xmath44 . ] . at @xmath44",
    "the characteristic curves in the @xmath50 plane are vertical , and at @xmath45 they are horizontal . figure  [ fig : coiling_characteristics](b ) is a sketch of what would happen to the characteristic curves around the intersection point  ( which we will call @xmath56 henceforward ) : they would wind around it , never reaching it .",
    "meanwhile , since @xmath55 in that vicinity , we have that @xmath32 is increasing along the curve .",
    "in other words , in @xmath57-space the characteristic curve is practically vertical , with @xmath32 increasing sharply along it .",
    "this case , depicted qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : winding_characteristic_x_c_f ] , corresponds to the presence of a cluster at the intersection point  @xmath56 .",
    "hence , for the system to be able to reach a stationary fluidized state , the curve @xmath45 must never cross the @xmath19 axis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : coiling_characteristics](a ) we have drawn this curve in the lower part of the plane , which corresponds to the case when the left wall is the colder one ( @xmath58 ) and the temperature difference is large enough that no cluster can form .",
    "further details of the algorithm are relayed to the appendix .",
    "for each  @xmath15 before the algorithm becomes unstable .",
    "the circles show the lowest values of  @xmath4 for each  @xmath15 before a cluster is detected in a molecular dynamics simulation of @xmath59 particles .",
    "the plus signs are joined by lines to guide the eye . [",
    "fig : threshold ] ]     for the case @xmath60 and @xmath61 . only one every four curves is shown to unclutter the picture .",

    "[ fig : sparse_f_qn035delta06 ] . only one every four curves is shown to unclutter the picture .",
    "[ fig : sparse_characs ] ]    figure  [ fig : threshold ] shows the threshold for cluster formation in molecular dynamics and the loss of convergence in the algorithm .",
    "we can say that they coincide , namely , the integration of boltzmann s equation with the present algorithm converges almost to the transition line beyond which a cluster begins to form .",
    "figure [ fig : sparse_f_qn035delta06 ] shows the characteristic lines in @xmath57-space when @xmath60 and @xmath62 .",
    "although it corresponds to a completely fluidized case it is not to far from the transition line , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : threshold ] .     and @xmath61 .",
    "the solid curve results from applying the algorithm described in the text , while the dashed curve was measured from a molecular dynamics simulation with @xmath59 particles . subfigures  ( a ) and  ( b ) show the same data , but on a different scale .",
    "subfigure  ( a ) emphasizes how the distribution is essentially gaussian , save for the sharp peak for slow particles .",
    "subfigure  ( b ) shows a detail of this peak , showing how the discontinuity is smoothed in the simulation .",
    "[ fig : distribution_and_peak_detail ] ]    figure  [ fig : sparse_characs ] shows the projection of the characteristic curves into the @xmath50 plane .",
    "the asymmetric aspect of the family of curves is due to the effective force which pushes particles toward the colder wall almost as if there was a space - dependent gravity - like force .",
    "the figure only shows the characteristic lines for small values of the velocity since further away the distribution is a bimodal gaussian .",
    "one interesting feature of this figure is the density of lines near @xmath46 for small negative velocity .",
    "it corresponds to a remarkable peak of the velocity distribution for velocities much smaller than the thermal velocity . in the present case the thermal velocity for the particles approaching the wall is about @xmath63 , an order of magnitude larger than the width of the peak .    to check how the distribution obtained from our algorithm compares with the distribution stemming from molecular dynamic simulations we show the distribution at the colder wall @xmath64 , where the discontinuity is more notorious . in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_and_peak_detail ] we compare with molecular dynamic results for @xmath59 particles , @xmath65 , and @xmath62 , namely quite far from the clustering regime . figure  [ fig : distribution_and_peak_detail](a ) shows the distribution for a wide range of velocities ( at this scale the calculated and the simulated solutions can not be resolved by the naked eye ) .",
    "it can be checked that the distribution behaves as two maxwellians , one for @xmath48 and a different one for @xmath49 ( with @xmath66 sufficiently large ) , and has a remarkable peak for small negative velocities . even though the system is far from the clustering regime , that peak is a reminder that a clustering singularity exists .     and @xmath61 . the thick solid line results of applying the algorithm described in the text .",
    "the other curves stem from molecular dynamics for 1000 ( dashed ) , 2000 ( dash - dotted ) , 5000 ( dotted ) , and 10000 ( thin solid line ) particles .",
    "[ fig : size_effects ] ]    figure  [ fig : distribution_and_peak_detail](b ) shows in detail the shape of the discontinuous behavior at the peak .",
    "the discontinuity that the analytic analysis predicts is softened in the simulations .",
    "this difference is due to size effects .",
    "in fact , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : size_effects ] ( which corresponds to a system on the verge of clusterization ) , simulations of systems with an increasing number of grains exhibit increasingly steeper behavior at the predicted discontinuity , approaching the result that boltzmann s equation implies and our algorithm yields .",
    "the final picture that emerges from all that has been said is , first , that boltzmann s equation for the quasi - elastic system is valid essentially in all points of the @xmath67 plane where the system has no cluster .",
    "the behavior of the system in its fluid phase is dominated by characteristic lines , trajectories of a _ test particle _ subjected to a force which attracts it to a point @xmath56 where the @xmath45 line crosses the @xmath19-axis . in the fluid phase such point @xmath56 is beyond the physical box , particles hit the colder wall , forget their past and reenter the system .",
    "we have not solved the time - dependent case when @xmath56 is inside the box . in such case",
    "many trajectories in phase space will wind around @xmath56 ( as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : coiling_characteristics](b ) and  [ fig : winding_characteristic_x_c_f ] ) , and the density at that point will tend to diverge , thus forming a cluster .",

    "in order to commence the integration , we need some initial _ ansatz _ @xmath68 .",
    "this may be , for example , the solution for the elastic case : @xmath69 e^{-c^2/2t_+}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the heaviside step function , @xmath71 is a constant chosen so as to have zero flux at the walls , and @xmath72 is a normalization constant . in practice , if it is available , it is convenient to choose as @xmath73 a previous solution for a case similar to the one being studied .",
    "this not only speeds up the convergence , but also may help avoid the spurious appearance of @xmath56 points at intermediate iterations .",
    "the next step is to see whether the @xmath45 curve crosses the @xmath44 line . if it does , the algorithm breaks down , and we must start from a better _",
    "if it lies wholly on @xmath74 , the characteristic curves will behave qualitatively as in fig .",
    "[ fig : coiling_characteristics](a ) . in this case",
    "we start by integrating the characteristics that begin at @xmath75 .",
    "if the curve lies wholly on @xmath76 the situation is inverted , and we must start from @xmath77 . in what follows we will assume that the situation is as in fig .",
    "[ fig : coiling_characteristics](a ) .",
    "this is always the case when we are sufficiently close to the solution .",
    "the next step is finding the dividing characteristic .",
    "this is done directly by the bisection method , choosing different values of @xmath78 so that the initial condition for the characteristic is @xmath79 the value of @xmath80 is chosen so that the net flux at the wall is zero : @xmath81 integrating along this characteristic in very small steps we find @xmath78 such that the corresponding curve has a turning point at @xmath82 , with @xmath83 less than a reasonably small number .    with this value of @xmath78",
    "we divide the interval @xmath84 , choosing many values @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 ) as starting points for characteristic curves",
    ". these will all be curves which will turn around and return to @xmath46 .",
    "the crossing points will define a natural discretization of the @xmath18  axis which will be used to tabulate the values of @xmath87 . in this way we always sample the turning point .",
    "now we start the integration : with _ increasing _",
    "@xmath88 , we integrate the characteristic that starts with @xmath85 , tabulating the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 for values of @xmath18 corresponding to the turning points of the previously integrated characteristics .",
    "this step is of paramount computational importance : at the next iteration we will need to calculate the integrals @xmath91 and @xmath92 . since these are integrals in @xmath19 keeping @xmath18 fixed , it is important to have values of @xmath17 tabulated at the same values of  @xmath18 .",
    "this precaution allows us to evaluate @xmath33 and @xmath93 in a fast and straightforward manner .",
    "having integrated along all the characteristics with @xmath94 , we now integrate characteristics that start from @xmath95 .",
    "these are curves that start at the left wall and reach the right wall , that is , they do not have a turning point .",
    "the completion of this step implies that we have @xmath87 in the whole half - space @xmath48 ( and also in part of @xmath49 ) .    at this point",
