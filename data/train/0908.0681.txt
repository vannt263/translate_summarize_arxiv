    "the development of efficient numerical methods to solve quantum impurity problems is an active research area .",
    "demand for powerful and flexible impurity solvers is driven by the success of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , which approximates fermionic lattice problems by self - consistent solutions of appropriately defined quantum impurity models.@xcite while impurity models are computationally more tractable than lattice models , the desire to include spatial correlations via cluster extensions@xcite or to treat complicated interaction terms in realistic descriptions of multi - orbital systems results in considerable computational challenges .",
    "the multi - site or multi - orbital nature of the most relevant impurity models favors monte carlo methods . in this area ,",
    "considerable progress has been achieved with the recent development of continuous - time or diagrammatic monte carlo techniques ( ctqmc ) .",
    "the ctqmc algorithms come in two flavors .",
    "weak coupling solvers@xcite are based on an expansion of the partition function in powers of the interaction terms .",
    "this is the method of choice for large cluster calculations of relatively simple models ( such as the one - band hubbard model ) , because the computational effort scales as the cube of the system size .",
    "the complementary approach is based on an expansion of the partition function in the impurity - bath hybridization.@xcite this so - called hybridization expansion technique treats the local interactions exactly and can be applied to a wide range of models , including the @xmath0-@xmath1 and kondo - lattice model.@xcite however , since the hilbert space of the local problem grows exponentially with the number of sites or orbitals , the computational effort scales exponentially , rather than cubically with system size .",
    "nevertheless , the flexibility of the hybridization - expansion method and the information it can provide about the relevant states of the atomic system make it a desirable tool in particular for the dmft study of transition metal oxides and actinide compounds . here",
    ", we present an implementation of this method which enables the reliable simulation of models with up to seven orbitals on present - day compute clusters with @xmath2 processors .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : hybrid_expansion ] provides a brief review of the hybridization expansion technique in the matrix formulation of refs .   and section [ sec : krylov ] discusses the new krylov - based implementation .",
    "we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the krylov approach in section [ sec : analysis ] , and use it in section [ sec : application ] to compute phase diagrams for a  toy model \" of the pnictides ( a five orbital model with almost degenerate bands and relatively large hund coupling term ) .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is a conclusion and outlook .",
    "a quantum impurity model describes an atom or molecule embedded in some host material with which it can exchange electrons .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath3 contains three terms : @xmath4 describes the impurity ( chemical potential , interaction and inter - site / orbital hopping terms ) , @xmath5 a bath of non - interacting electrons whose parameters are fixed by the dmft self - consistency,@xcite and the hybridization term @xmath6 controls the exchange of electrons between the impurity and the bath .",

    "the element @xmath27 of the matrix @xmath28 is given by the hybridization function @xmath29 , which is defined in terms of the hybridization parameters @xmath30 and the bath energy levels @xmath31.@xcite given the weights @xmath32 , a stochastic sampling of all relevant configurations @xmath21 can be implemented using local updates such as the random insertion or removal of pairs of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "for the present purpose , the important thing to note is that up to the irrelevant constant @xmath33 the weights consist of two factors : @xmath34 $ ] evaluates the imaginary - time evolution of the quantum impurity for a given sequence of hybridization events , while @xmath35 gives the contribution of the bath degrees of freedom which have been integrated out . using fast matrix updates , the determinant ratios for local updates can be computed in a time @xmath36 .",
    "the exponential scaling of the algorithm is due to the trace factor . with the exception of single - site multi - orbital systems with density - density interactions ( for which the occupation number basis is an eigenbasis of @xmath37 and",
    "thus the very efficient segment formulation@xcite can be used ) , the exponential growth of @xmath38 with number of sites or orbitals means that the simulation of large systems becomes computationally expensive .",
    "the strategy proposed in ref .   was to evaluate the trace in the eigenbasis of the local hamiltonian . in this basis ,",
    "the time evolution operators @xmath39 become diagonal and can be evaluated easily . on the other hand ,",
    "the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are sparse and simple in the occupation number basis , become complicated matrices in the eigenbasis of @xmath37 . to facilitate the task of multiplying these operator matrices",
    "it is important to order the eigenstates according to conserved quantum numbers as explained in ref .  .",
    "the evaluation of the trace is then reduced to block matrix multiplications of the form @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is either a creation or annihilation operator , @xmath44 denotes the index of the matrix block , and the sum runs over those sectors which are compatible with the operator sequence . with this technique ,",
    "3-orbital models or 4-site clusters can be simulated efficiently.@xcite however , since the matrix blocks are dense and the largest blocks grow exponentially with system size , the simulation of 5-orbital models becomes already quite expensive and the simulation of 7-orbital models with 5 , 6 or 7 electrons is only doable if the size of the blocks is severely truncated .",
    "in fact , one should distinguish two types of truncations :    a.   the truncation of the outer trace ( @xmath45 ) to those quantum number sectors or states which give the dominant contribution , [ ref : trunc_i ] b.   the reduction of the size of the operator blocks @xmath46 via elimination of high - energy states .",
    "[ ref : trunc_ii ]    the truncation of type ( [ ref : trunc_i ] ) is harmless at low enough temperature , because it restricts the possible states at only a single point on the imaginary - time interval . on the other hand , truncations of the type ( [ ref : trunc_ii ] ) , if not done properly , can lead to systematic errors , whose effect will be hard to estimate in large systems , because the truncations are necessarily severe .",
    "as an alternative strategy to evaluate the trace factor in eq .",
    "( [ weight_strong ] ) we propose to    1 .",
    "adopt the occupation number basis , in which the @xmath40-operator matrices can easily be applied to any given state , and in which the sparse nature of @xmath37 can be exploited during the imaginary time evolutions by relying on efficient krylov - space methods , 2 .   to approximate the outer trace by a sum over the lowest energy states ( i.e. truncation type  ( [ ref : trunc_i ] ) introduced above ) .",
    "this implementation involves only matrix - vector multiplications of the type @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with sparse operators @xmath49 and @xmath37 , and is thus doable in principle even for systems for which the multiplication of dense matrix blocks becomes prohibitively expensive , or for which the matrix blocks will not even fit into the memory anymore .",
    "furthermore , no approximation of type ( [ ref : trunc_ii ] ) is required , so that all excited states remain accessible at intermediate @xmath50 in the trace .",
    "the sparse nature of the hybridization operators is evident given the fact that they consist of creation and annihilation operators in the occupation number basis .",
    "@xmath37 is sparse because the number of interaction terms is proportional to a small integer power of the number of orbitals , while the dimension of the matrix grows exponentially with the number of orbitals .",
    "our implementation is based on very efficient sparse matrix algorithms for the evaluation of matrix exponentials applied to a vector , i.e.  @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite these algorithms construct the krylov space @xmath52 and then approximate the full matrix exponential by the matrix exponential of the hamiltonian projected onto the krylov space @xmath53 . in ref .",
    "it has been shown rigorously that these krylov space algorithms converge rapidly as a function of @xmath54 , typically reaching convergence for very small iteration numbers @xmath55 , although the number of iterations depends on the time interval @xmath50 .",
    "let us describe the algorithm for the trace evaluation in some more detail .",
    "first , during the initialization part of the simulation , the following steps are required :    1 .   obtain the low energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of @xmath37 using ( band-)lanczos or davidson techniques , or alternatively diagonalize @xmath37 completely using full diagonalization techniques .",
    "the band - lanczos or davidson techniques are needed to resolve the exact degeneracies of the eigenfunctions .",
    "2 .   decide which eigenstates of the spectrum are to be kept in the outer trace .",
    "it is important not to destroy the multiplet structure of @xmath37 when truncating the trace .",
    "the truncation criteria employed in our implementation are discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .",
    "then , in the actual evaluation of a trace , we proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "propagate a retained state in the trace up to the first hybridization event ( forward and backward in time ) .",
    "since the initial state is an eigenstate of @xmath37 , this state is simply multiplied by an exponential factor for the first interval .",
    "2 .   apply the hybridization operator on the propagated state .",
    "3 .   propagate the current state up to the next hybridization event using the krylov - space approach to the matrix exponential described above .",
    "the state to be propagated is generically not an eigenstate of @xmath37 anymore , so the krylov space must be constructed up to a certain dimension .",
    "the krylov space size should not be kept fixed , but should be determined for each imaginary time interval according to a convergence criterion . in the applications reported in the present paper",
    "the average krylov space dimension is @xmath56 .",
    "4 .   go back to step 4 if more hybridization operators are present .",
    "add the contribution of the propagated state to the trace .",
    "go back to step 3 until all retained states have been considered in the trace .    in the truncated trace approach it is important to measure the various local observables at @xmath57 in order",
    "to be least affected by the truncation of the trace at @xmath58 ( and equivalently at @xmath59 ) .",
    "we conclude this section by illustrating the main advantage of the krylov space method through a simple time complexity analysis of the algorithm .",
    "say we want to determine the trace of a given sequence of the hybridization operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "according to the truncation ( [ ref : trunc_i ] ) introduced above we perform the trace over @xmath60 states , where @xmath61 is the typical size of the impurity hilbert space , which grows exponentially with the number of sites or orbitals contained in the  impurity \" .",
    "since there are @xmath62 hybridization events , the complexity of the application of the hybridization operators is @xmath63 .",
    "the imaginary time evolution on the other hand is nontrivial on @xmath64 intervals .",
    "based on ref .  , we assume a typical number of iterations @xmath65 is needed to reach convergence for the imaginary time evolution of a single state @xmath66 over an interval length @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that the complexity of the imaginary time evolution part is @xmath67 and the overall time complexity amounts to @xmath68).\\ ] ] in the worst case where we retain all states in the trace @xmath69 the complexity scales as @xmath70 , but in the best case @xmath71 the time complexity is _ linear _ in @xmath72 .    in comparison",
    "the matrix formulation has a less favorable scaling with @xmath72 . in the case where we keep all states in the trace",
    "the time complexity is @xmath73 because of the expensive dense matrix - matrix multiplications , whereas it is @xmath74 for the truncated trace version .    while it is therefore obvious that in theory the krylov space approach is the method of choice due to its superior @xmath72 scaling , in practice the precise numbers of @xmath75 , and @xmath72 will determine which one of the two formulations performs better for a given problem with tractable hilbert space size . in the following section",
    "we address the performance and scaling of the two algorithmic formulations .",
    "before trying to determine the system size for which the krylov implementation outperforms the matrix method , we demonstrate the accuracy of the new approach .",
    "we consider multi - orbital models with a local hamiltonian of the form @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ & -\\sum_{a\\ne b}j(\\psi^\\dagger_{a,\\downarrow}\\psi^\\dagger_{b,\\uparrow}\\psi_{b,\\downarrow}\\psi_{a,\\uparrow } + \\psi^\\dagger_{b,\\uparrow}\\psi^\\dagger_{b,\\downarrow}\\psi_{a,\\uparrow}\\psi_{a,\\downarrow } + h.c . )",

    "the hybridization function is that of a non - interacting model with semi - circular density of states of bandwidth @xmath81 ev , and the chemical potential has been chosen such that the system is at half - filling ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the crystal field splittings @xmath83 are zero .",
    "we give the parameters @xmath84 , @xmath1 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 in units of ev .    for three orbitals ,",
    "both methods yield accurate results in a few cpu hours .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "( [ gfcomparison ] ) shows the measured green functions for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and different values of inverse temperature @xmath89 , while the bottom panel compares the results for @xmath90 and different values of the interaction strength .",
    "the open symbols ( red online ) were computed with the matrix method without any truncations .",
    "these are thus exact results ( monte carlo errors are much smaller than the symbol size ) which may be used to test the accuracy of the krylov approach .",
    "the krylov results are plotted by full symbols ( blue online ) .",
    "these data were computed with only the lowest energy states in the outer trace ( four in this case , since the ground state of the half - filled model carries spin 3/2 ) , which means that we use here the @xmath91 approximation for @xmath92 .",
    "while deviations between the approximate and exact result are apparent at @xmath93 , they become smaller as temperature is lowered and for @xmath94 can be considered negligible .",
    "the bottom panel shows that for @xmath90 , essentially perfect agreement between the two methods is found for all relevant interaction strengths .",
    "these results can readily be understood from the scaling of the perturbation order with @xmath84 and @xmath89 in the hybridization expansion method.@xcite the average perturbation order grows roughly linearly with the length @xmath89 of the imaginary time interval and decreases as interaction strength is increased . since we restrict the system to the ground state at one point of the imaginary time interval ( @xmath58 ) , a larger number of hybridization events facilitates the relaxation into the true equilibrium distribution ( measurements are performed at @xmath57 ) .",
    "more importantly , the lower the temperature , the larger the overlap of this probability distribution with the ground state , i.e. the probability of the system being in the ground state at any given time becomes large .",
    "thus , forcing the system into the ground state at @xmath58 to compute the trace more efficiently has no severe effects at low enough temperature .",
    "our data suggest that the truncation of @xmath92 to the ground state vectors is legitimate for temperatures which are @xmath95 of the bandwidth ( @xmath81  ev ) and we will use this @xmath91 truncation in all subsequent krylov calculations .",
    "we also note that the truncation of the trace does not seem to induce a sign problem for the multi - orbital problems studied in the present work .      to compare the efficiency of the two implementations we plot in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] the number of local updates per second for multi - orbital systems with @xmath96 orbitals .",
    "a local update is either an insertion or a removal of a pair of @xmath40 , @xmath41 operators and involves the calculation of @xmath97 . in our @xmath22-orbital models [ eq .",
    "( [ h_loc ] ) ] each orbital interacts with every other through density - density , spin exchange and pair hopping terms .",
    "the intra - orbital repulsion is @xmath84 , the hund coupling parameter @xmath80 , and the crystal field splittings are zero .",
    "we chose @xmath87 , @xmath90 in all the calculations , and the hybridization function of the non - interacting model with semi - circular density of states of bandwidth @xmath81 .",
    "the half - filling condition for these multi - orbital systems is @xmath98 .",
    "the blue lines with diamonds show the results for the matrix code without any truncation . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the evaluation of the trace becomes the bottleneck of the simulation and we observe an exponential decrease in the number of updates per second .",
    "the red lines with triangles show the result for the matrix code in which the trace is restricted to the sector @xmath44 containing the ground state ( but without any truncation in the size of the blocks ) .",
    "the rather modest effect of the truncation is due to the fact that at half - filling the largest blocks can not be discarded .",
    "the black lines with circles show the number of updates obtained with the krylov - method .",
    "the curve still drops exponentially with increasing @xmath22 , but the slope is smaller than in the matrix case , as expected from the scaling argument in the previous section .",
    "while the number of updates in the matrix implementation drops by about 4 orders of magnitude as @xmath22 is increased from 3 to 5 , it drops only 2 orders of magnitude in the krylov implementation .",
    "the more favorable scaling in the krylov - case allows us to measure also @xmath100 and @xmath101 and as seen in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , the slope remains essentially unchanged .",
    "the time per update increases by about two orders of magnitude from @xmath102 to @xmath101 . given that the krylov code allows the simulation of 5-orbital models ( transition metal compounds ) on a small number of processors",
    ", we therefore expect that this method will enable the controlled and accurate simulation of 7-orbital models ( lanthanide and actinide compounds ) on larger clusters with a few hundred processors .",
    "the outer trace must at least contain all the ground state eigenvectors , and the ground state degeneracy of @xmath37 depends on the model parameters .",
    "we therefore compare in fig .",
    "[ scaling_mu ] the efficiency of the matrix and krylov implementations for the five orbital model at different values of the chemical potential ( chosen such that the ground state lies in the @xmath103 electron sector ) .",
    "the corresponding ground state degeneracies are 6 , 25 , 40 , 30 , 10 and 1 .",
    "the increase in @xmath92 from 6 to 25 leads to a slight decrease in the efficiency of the krylov method if @xmath85 is increased from @xmath104 to @xmath105 . for even larger @xmath85 , the efficiency increases , because the relevant quantum sectors become smaller .",
    "this also explains why the advantage of the krylov implementation over the matrix implementation decreases as one moves away from half - filling .",
    "if the krylov trace is restricted to ground state vectors , level crossings in @xmath37 will typically lead to sudden changes in the number and types of states considered in @xmath106 , even in situations where the physical state of the system is not expected to change dramatically .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ statistics ] , this does not lead to inconsistencies if the temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "the figure plots the probability distribution of the different quantum number sectors , ordered as @xmath107 from left to right , for the 5 orbital model with @xmath87 , @xmath80 and @xmath108 ( red circles , @xmath109 ) , @xmath110 ( blue diamonds , @xmath111 ) and @xmath112 ( black triangles , @xmath113 ) at @xmath90 .",
    "all three trace calculations yield consistent distributions , and thus the same physical state .",
    "the ( small ) inaccuracies near level crossings could be further reduced by retaining all the states in a certain energy window above the ground state .",
    "in this section we illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of the krylov method with dmft results for 5-orbital models with semi - circular density of states of bandwidth 4 .",
    "we will consider the situation in which all bands are degenerate ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) and a  2 + 3 \" @xmath116-@xmath117 crystal field splitting of magnitude 0.5 , in which the doublet is shifted down ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) .",
    "all the calculations are for @xmath90 and require less than 50 cpu hours per iteration .      figure  [ phasediagram ] shows the paramagnetic phase diagram in the space of chemical potential ( relative to @xmath120 ) and interaction strength .",
    "the top panel is the result for @xmath121 and the bottom panel for @xmath122 .",
    "we first discuss the orbitally symmetric case which corresponds to the blue lines with stars .",
    "the figure shows the mott insulating lobes with @xmath102 and 6 electrons .",
    "additional lobes with @xmath123 and a band insulating solution with @xmath124 also exist , but are not shown ( computations near half - filling are the most challenging ones , because they involve quantum number sectors with high dimension ) .",
    "the hund coupling @xmath1 is seen to stabilize the half - filled @xmath102 mott lobe while pushing the critical interaction for the @xmath100 mott lobe to larger values .",
    "the different widths of these lobes and their @xmath1-dependence can be understood from the @xmath85-dependence of the eigenstates of @xmath37 as explained in the context of a 3-orbital calculation in ref .  .",
    "a comparison of the 5-orbital result for @xmath122 to the lower panel of fig . 2 in ref .   and the 2-orbital calculations ( fig .",
    "2 ) in ref .   furthermore shows the evolution of @xmath125 with increasing number of orbitals : in the 2-orbital model @xmath126 , in the 3-orbital model @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and in the 5-orbital case we find @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "thus , in the presence of a hund coupling @xmath80 , the critical interaction strength for the mott insulating phase decreases with increasing number of orbitals , in contrast to the situation for @xmath131.@xcite    the very large interaction strengths required to study mott physics away from half - filling are not a problem .",
    "an attractive feature of the hybridization expansion method is the fact that the relevant perturbation orders decrease with increasing interaction strength.@xcite at @xmath132 and @xmath90 , the @xmath100 mott insulating solution for @xmath122 has average perturbation order @xmath133 per orbital and spin , i.e. @xmath134 in total .",

    "the resulting phase diagram is plotted with crosses and red lines . the @xmath102 and 6 mott lobes",
    "are little affected by the crystal field splitting .",
    "the value of @xmath125 is almost unchanged for @xmath102 , and decreases by about 2 for @xmath100 .",
    "the width of the @xmath100 lobe is increased by about @xmath86 and shrinks by a similar amount for @xmath102 .",
    "compared to the 2 + 1 splitting considered in ref .",
    "the stability of the @xmath100 lobe is not dramatically enhanced , because the insulating phase does not consist of half - filled and band - insulating solutions : the two degenerate bands ( @xmath135 , 2 ) accommodate 3 electrons .",
    "larger effects on the stability of the @xmath100 lobe are expected for 4 + 1 or 3 + 1 + 1 splittings .",
    "a qualitative difference to the orbitally symmetric case is that the @xmath102 and 6 lobes are now embedded in an orbital selective mott phase characterized by insulating , half - filled green functions in the three degenerate bands ( @xmath136 , 4 , 5 ) and metallic green functions in the two lower lying bands ( @xmath137 ) . for @xmath100 electrons ,",
    "the transition from the metallic into the orbital selective mott phase takes place near @xmath138 ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath139 ( @xmath122 ) , respectively .",
    "the metal - insulator transition in the three degenerate bands thus occurs at an interaction strength which is substantially smaller than the @xmath125 required to induce the mott transition in the model without crystal field splitting .",
    "this finding is consistent with the enhanced stability of the half - filled mott lobe in the 3-orbital model.@xcite      the krylov implementation retains the attractive features of the hybridization expansion , such as the ability to measure the relevance of different states in the hilbert space of @xmath37 ( fig .",

    "the atomic picture is however not a good reference in the parameter regime considered here .",

    "[ stot ] that in the moderately correlated metallic phase the lower spin states have appreciable weight , and the effect of the crystal field splitting is small .",
    "no dramatic increase in @xmath140 is observed as @xmath141 is increased from 0 to 0.05 , and the crystal field splitting of @xmath143 leads to no significant reduction in @xmath140 , even at @xmath131 .",
    "the toy model considered here captures some aspects of the iron - based high temperature superconductors .",
    "a minimal description of these materials seems to require all five @xmath153-bands,@xcite and the bandwidth of 4 ev adopted here is consistent with the band structure obtained from density functional theory .",

    "[ phasediagram ] can provide some information about the role of correlations and crystal field splittings , and the relevance of mott physics .",
    "in particular , we see that the solution with @xmath100 and @xmath142 is far away from the mott lobe in the orbitally symmetric case , especially if the hund coupling is large . on the other hand ,",
    "our results for the 2 + 3 splitting indicate that even relatively small crystal field splittings can have a substantial effect on the phase diagram and lead to the opening of a gap in some bands at @xmath84 much below the @xmath125 for the fully gapped phase .",
    "correlations in pnictides may thus be relevant in the sense that the materials are not too far from an orbital selective mott state .",
    "but for such a scenario , the hund coupling parameter @xmath1 would have to be rather small : for @xmath121 , @xmath142 is a factor of 6 below the critical value for the orbital selective transition and for @xmath122 it is still a factor of 2 below .",
    "a moderately correlated metallic state seems more consistent with the phase diagram of our simple toy model .",

    "however , since details of the band structure appear to affect the properties of iron based superconductors in profound ways,@xcite more realistic calculations within the lda+dmft framework would be required to settle these issues .",
    "we have presented an implementation of the hybridization expansion impurity solver which makes use of _ sparse - matrix _ exact diagonalization techniques to evaluate the weight of monte carlo configurations .",
    "this method , while still scaling exponentially with system size , enables a much more efficient simulation of large multi - orbital problems than the established matrix formulation . in the new approach ,",
    "the trace is restricted to a small number of states ( typically the lowest energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) but no other truncations or approximations are necessary during the time evolution of these states .",
    "we have demonstrated that the restriction of the outer trace leads to negligible systematic errors at low temperature .",
    "therefore , the krylov method provides a controlled and efficient implementation of the hybridization expansion approach which enables the dmft study of transition metal and actinide compounds with realistic interactions .",
    "we thank h. aoki , r. valenti , i. eremin and e. gull for helpful discussions .",
