    "scrambling describes a property of the dynamics of closed quantum systems , in which initially localized information spreads out over the whole system , thereby becoming inaccessible locally .",
    "the concept of scrambling originates from the study of black holes in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "if information escapes from a black hole , the thermal nature of the hawking radiation @xcite indicates that the state of any matter and information falling into the black hole has been scrambled and so gets lost from the perspective of an external observer .",
    "in particular , the `` fast scrambling conjecture '' @xcite states that the fastest scramblers take time logarithmic in the system size to scramble information , and that black holes are the fastest scramblers .    scrambling and similar notions play important roles in other areas of physics as well .",
    "for example , scrambling is closely related to many - body localization and thermalization ( see @xcite for a recent review ) : quantum systems that exhibit localization clearly do not scramble or thermalize , since information of local initial conditions fails to spread , and so remains accessible to local measurements .",
    "by contrast , a many - body system that undergoes scrambling moves to states that appear random with respect to local measurement : here , the notion of scrambling can be seen as a form of thermalization at infinite temperature .",
    "quantum chaos is also a close relative of scrambling . under chaotic dynamics , initially local operators",
    "grow to overlap with the whole system ( the butterfly effect ) .",
    "that is , chaotic quantum systems are scramblers @xcite .",
    "in particular , the behaviors of the so - called out - of - time - order ( oto ) correlators can probe the growth of local perturbations @xcite .",
    "their role as diagnostics of chaos has led to the active application of oto correlators to the study of scrambling @xcite and many - body localization @xcite .",
    "this work is mainly motivated by two key features of scrambling .",
    "first , scrambling of quantum information and the growth of entanglement go hand in hand : information initially present in local perturbations ends up encoded in global entanglement so that it becomes irretrievable by simple measurements .",
    "entanglement captures the nonclassical essence of scrambling , and leads to information - theoretic measures of scrambling such as the entanglement entropy .",
    "second , scrambling can be achieved by a sufficiently random dynamics .",
    "the main idea of the foundational paper of this field @xcite is to use random dynamics to simulate scrambling behaviors of black holes .",
    "that is , scrambling is also related to the generation of randomness .",
    "the goal of this paper is to connect entanglement entropy , given by generalized entropies of different orders , with degrees of randomness , characterized by designs .",
    "we establish a strong connection between rnyi entanglement entropies and the degree of randomness induced by designs of the same order , in both the random unitary and random state settings .",
    "( we note that a recent paper @xcite establishes a related connection between @xmath1-point oto correlators and @xmath0-designs via frame potentials .",
    "however , the average oto correlators that @xcite mainly studies may not directly correspond to entropies in our setting . )",
    "generalized entropies of order @xmath0 raise the density matrix to the @xmath0-th power .",
    "the higher the order of the generalized entropy , the more sensitive that entropy is to nonuniformity in the spectrum of the density matrix .",
    "an @xmath0-design is an ensemble of states or unitaries whose first @xmath0 moments are indistinguishable from completely random states or unitaries ( drawn uniformly from the haar measure ) .",
    "the higher the order of the design , the better it emulates the full randomness of the haar distribution .",
    "our main result is that @xmath0-designs induce almost maximal rnyi-@xmath0 entanglement entropies .",
    "our analysis strengthens known results relating entanglement entropy and randomness , such as page s theorem @xcite for random states and hosur - qi - roberts - yoshida @xcite for random unitaries .",
    "these results allow us to elucidate the tradeoffs involved in creating and characterizing higher degrees of randomness . on the one hand , a completely random unitary channel ( drawn uniformly from the haar measure )",
    "certainly scrambles information , but it requires exponentially many local gates and random bits to generate @xcite .",
    "in fact , 2-designs , which can be efficiently implemented @xcite , can already achieve information scrambling .",
    "so , for example , simple quantum circuits can create 2-designs with almost maximal von neumann entanglement entropy . on the other hand , generalized entanglement entropies of higher orders",
    "are more sensitive to nonuniformity ( such as sharp peaks ) in the spectrum of the reduced density matrix , i.e.  the entanglement spectrum @xcite , which can be invisible to the ordinary ( von neumann ) entanglement entropy .",
    "pseudorandom unitaries may typically exhibit almost maximal von neumann entanglement entropy , but do not necessarily maximize high - order rnyi entanglement entropies .",
    "our results reveal a fine - grained hierarchy of complexities between information and haar scrambling .",
    "this hierarchy is defined relative to the moments of the haar measure , and can be probed by generalized entanglement entropies . to summarize",
    ", we aim at deriving tight relations between entropy and randomness .",
    "to do so , we calculate the generalized entanglement entropies averaged over state and unitary designs .",
    "now we introduce our approaches and results more specifically . to study scrambling properties of unitary channels , we map them to a dual state via choi isomorphism , and study the entanglement properties of this dual state . as in @xcite , we partition the input register of the choi state into two parts , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the output register into @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "our results rely on the calculation of average @xmath6 , the defining element of order-@xmath0 entanglement entropies between @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the choi state .",
    "we employ tools from weingarten calculus to explicitly compute the haar integrals of @xmath6 for all @xmath0 in both the asymptotic and nonasymptotic regimes , which are by definition equal to the average over unitary @xmath0-designs .",
    "we are able to use these results to lower bound the regular rnyi entanglement entropies , as they are convex in @xmath6 .",
    "the key conclusion is that the rnyi-@xmath0 entanglement entropies averaged over unitary @xmath0-designs are almost maximal . in other words ,",
    "a random unitary sampled from a unitary @xmath0-design typically exhibits nearly maximal rnyi-@xmath0 entanglement entropies .",
    "these results indicate that the rnyi-@xmath0 entanglement entropies can diagnose the randomness complexity of unitary @xmath0-designs .",
    "we also study the @xmath9 limit of rnyi , the min entanglement entropy , in particular .",
    "we show that unitary designs of an order that scales logarithmically in the dimension of the unitary achieve almost maximal average min entanglement entropy , which implies that they are already indistinguishable from haar random by the entanglement spectrum alone .",
    "higher moments make no difference in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "then we consider the more straightforward and well - known problem of entanglement in random states .",
    "previous results in this setting , e.g.   page s theorem , are also not tight in a similar sense .",
    "we obtain analogous results as in the random unitary setting .",
    "most importantly , we show that ( projective ) @xmath0-designs exhibit almost maximal rnyi-@xmath0 entanglement entropies , which can be regarded as a tight version of page s theorem . as in the case of unitary designs , state designs of logarithmic order already maximize min entanglement entropy .",
    "moreover , we are able to show that there exists a projective 2-design such that all higher rnyi entanglement entropies are bounded away from maximum .",
    "the existence of such a 2-design establishes a clear separation between the entropic complexity of 2-designs and those of higher orders .",
    "our results reveal intrinsic connections between the order of generalized entropies and the moment of randomness .",
    "we also include several results related to e.g.  rnyi entropies , designs , and weingarten calculus , which may be of independent interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , we formally define the central concepts of this paper : the generalized quantum entropies and designs .",
    "sections [ sec : randu ] and [ sec : rands ] contain analysis of the choi model of random unitary and the random state settings respectively . finally we provide some concluding remarks about our results and future directions in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "peripheral results and technical details are included in the appendix .",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a comprehensive introduction of standard and soft notations of asymptotics ( e.g.  big - o and soft big - o ) that will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the theme of this paper is to establish connections between generalized quantum entropies and designs , which we shall formally introduce in this section .      some parametrized generalizations of the shannon and von neumann entropy , most importantly the rnyi and tsallis entropies ,",
    "are found to be useful in both classical and quantum regimes .",
    "we will find that rnyi entropies are more suitable for characterizing scrambling than tsallis entropies .",
    "here we focus on entropies defined on a quantum state @xmath10 living in a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "a unified definition of generalized quantum entropies is given in @xcite :    the quantum unified @xmath11-entropy of a state @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13.\\ ] ] the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath14 are respectively referred to as the order and the family of an entropy in this paper .",
    "the @xmath15 element plays a key role in this paper .",
    "entropies specified by a certain order @xmath0 are collectively called @xmath0 entropies .",
    "the @xmath16 limit gives the von neumann entropy . by fixing @xmath14 ,",
    "one obtains a family of entropies parametrized by order @xmath0 .",
    "we define the following function to be the characteristic function of an entropy : @xmath17 which is obtained by treating @xmath15 as the argument @xmath18 .",
    "the convexity of this characteristic function is important to many of our results .",
    "the most representative families are rnyi ( the limiting case @xmath19 ) and tsallis ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , @xmath21 entropies ( e.g.  tsallis ) have some undesirable features for our purposes .",
    "most importantly , the maximal value is dependent on @xmath0 , thus it does not make much sense to directly compare @xmath21 entropy of different orders @xmath0 , which is key to our results .",
    "moreover , they are not even additive on maximally mixed states , so on runs into trouble when deriving e.g.  tripartite information from entanglement entropy .",
    "in addition , notice that for @xmath22 ( excluding tsallis ) , the characteristic function is concave in the relevant @xmath23 regime , which prevents us from using jensen s inequality to establish several crucial bounds .",
    "these problems will be explained in more detail later .",
    "in contrast , rnyi entropies do not have these problems . in this work",
    ", we mainly focus on this well - behaved family :    the quantum rnyi-@xmath24 entropy of a state @xmath12 is defined as @xmath25    for @xmath26 , @xmath27 is singular and defined by taking a limit .",
    "@xmath28 is the max / hartley entropy ; @xmath29 is just the von neumann entropy .",
    "the @xmath30 limit , the min entropy , plays a special role in our study :    the quantum min entropy of a state @xmath12 is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the operator norm of @xmath10 , @xmath33 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath10",
    ".    other rnyi entropies are well - defined by eq .",
    "( [ renyidef ] ) .",
    "the @xmath34 case @xmath35 , often called the rnyi-2 or collision entropy , is also a widely used and highly relevant quantity . in the context of scrambling",
    ", a key result of @xcite is that the rnyi-2 entanglement entropy is directly related to the 4-point oto correlators , thus can probe chaos . ref .",
    "@xcite also discusses scrambling in a wess - zumino - witten model using this quantity .",
    "also notice that @xmath36 is directly related to the quantum purity @xmath37 ( recall that less pure subsystems dictate entanglement ) , and is so frequently employed in the study of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it can be directly verified that rnyi entropies are additive and have the same maximal value @xmath38 for @xmath38 qubits .",
    "an important feature of rnyi entropy for analyzing degree of scrambling is that the values of rnyi entropy of different orders can in principle be well gapped : consequently , the behavior of states and unitaries at different orders of rnyi entropy can be used to distinguish between different degrees of scrambling . here",
    "we give a simple example .",
    "consider a density operator in @xmath39-dimenisonal hilebert space has one large eigenvalue @xmath40 , and the rest of the spectrum is uniform / degenerate .",
    "that is , the spectrum reads @xmath41 then the min entropy only cares about the largest eigenvalue by definition : @xmath42 which is @xmath43 ( linear in the number of qubits ) away from maximum .",
    "however , rnyi-2 is insensitive to this single peak : @xmath44 which is almost maximal ( with a residual constant ) .",
    "this establishes a clear separation between the low and high ends of rnyi entropies .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 produces @xmath43 gaps between all finite orders : @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "so the slope decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it equals 1 for @xmath34 , and approaches @xmath48 in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "the intuition is simply that promoting the power of eigenvalues essentially amplifies the nonuniformity of the spectrum .",
    "similar separations will be constructed in the random state setting . in the appendix ,",
    "we derive more properties of rnyi entropies , including inequalities relating different orders of rnyi entropies ( appendix [ app : renyiineq ] ) , and a weaker form of subadditivity ( appendix [ app : renyisub ] ) .    fig .",

    "the mutual information between local regions of the input and output @xmath81 and @xmath82 should be small .",

    "the haar - averaged ( completely random ) values of the terms in the von neumann @xmath89 was computed in @xcite , as a baseline for scrambling .",
    "however , it is clear that a pseudorandom ensemble ( such as a 2-design ) can already reach these roof values @xcite , which indicates that there is a hierarchy of fine - grained complexities of scrambling , corresponding to different degrees of randomness .",
    "this section aims at formalizing this observation in the same choi state model .",
    "we rewrite the information - theoretic quantities in terms of generalized quantum entropies ( such as rnyi and tsallis ) of different orders , to study the connections between these entropies and designs .      by using individual indices for different subregions ,",

    "recall that @xmath16 gives the von neumann entropy , which probes information / page scrambling .",
    "first notice that 1-designs do not necessarily scramble quantum information .",
    "for example , the ensemble of tensor product of pauli operators acting on each qubit @xmath276 forms a 1-design @xcite .",
    "however , this pauli ensemble clearly does not scramble since it can not create interaction / entanglement among qubits ( so local operators do not grow ) .",

    "on the other hand , 2-designs are sufficient to maximize rnyi-2 entropies , which lower bounds the corresponding von neumann entropies .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there actually exists an arbitrarily large gap between them .",
    "so one can also say that information scrambling is strictly weaker than 2-scrambling .",
    "therefore , the minimal information scrambling corresponds to a scrambling complexity in between 1- and 2-designs .",
    "another special case is @xmath9 , which leads to the min entropy @xmath277 .",
    "almost maximal min entanglement entropy directly indicates that the spectrum of the reduced density operators ( the entanglement spectrum ) is almost uniform .",
    "as the example of @xmath278 ( in section [ entropies ] ) shows , the min entropy is extremely sensitive to even one single peak in the entanglement spectrum , since it only cares about the largest eigenvalue .",
    "so it is in a sense the `` harshest '' entropy measure .",
    "the min entanglement entropy is then the strongest entropic diagnostic of scrambling : if it is always almost maximal , then the entanglement spectrum can not accommodate any peak , and we simply can not distinguish the scrambler from completely random by looking at the spectrum of any reduced density matrix alone .",
    "we call this situation max scrambling",
    ". we shall arrive at formal arguments that designs are distinguishable from haar only up to a finite order ( in both the random unitaries and random states settings ) for finite dimensions , by studying the min entanglement entropy .",
    "given the definition of max scrambling by the min entropy , one may wonder if the full haar measure is required to achieve this strongest form of entropic scrambling . here",

    "a further question then arises as to whether the entropic scrambling complexities form a strict hierarchy , i.e. , whether different complexities are gapped . of course , by the nontrivial moments result just presented , we already know that @xmath300 complexities are not well separated .",
    "a straightforward definition of a separation between @xmath0- and @xmath272-scrambling ( @xmath301 ) is the following : there exist scramblers such that the associated rnyi-@xmath272 entropies are always near maximal , but some rnyi-@xmath0 entropies can be bounded away from maximal .",
