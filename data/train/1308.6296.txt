    "the apostolatos - thorne model @xcite describes the dynamics of a self gravitating cylindrical shell of counter rotating particles .",
    "it was originally introduced in the context of a discussion of the effect of rotation on halting the collapse of the system .",
    "but the system is interesting also on other grounds , because it provides a model of a mechanical system , with a simple newtonian limit , in interaction with a dynamical gravitational field , interchanging energy with the gravitational radiation contents of the field .",
    "as shown in @xcite , it is not difficult to obtain a set of coupled ordinary and partial derivative equations for the dynamical variables whose solutions describe the possible evolutions of the system .",
    "although the original paper @xcite did not give a detailed computation of the evolution of the system , it included an extensive discussion of the main qualitative features that would result from the interaction of the shell with the gravitational field .",
    "there has recently been a renewed interest in finding solutions and analyzing this detailed evolution in several cases and for different types of initial data . in @xcite ,",
    "hamity , ccere and barraco considered the evolution of the outer shell in a system that contains also an inner shell to allow for the imposition of a particular boundary condition .",
    "they also make use of some simplifying assumptions that reduce the full set of evolution equations to a particular ordinary differential equation for the motion of the shell .",
    "a different approach , where the evolution of the system is analyzed in the linear approximation was considered by gleiser and ramirez in @xcite .",
    "the stability of the static configurations of the system under arbitrary perturbations was proved in an extended analysis given in @xcite , where the existence of quasi normal modes was also considered . a related analysis , but with a different interpretation was also given in @xcite .",
    "a particular case considered in @xcite was that resulting from initial data with a structure similar to that corresponding to a static solution , but differing from that one , so that the shell starts its motion with a non vanishing acceleration .",
    "this type of initial data was designated `` momentarily static and radiation free '' ( msrf ) , and the authors of @xcite considered it as both an example of consistent initial data for the system and as an example of the possible evolution resulting from the dynamic equations .",
    "no explicit solution is given in @xcite , but the authors analyze explicitly the initial acceleration of the shell and provide qualitative arguments for the resulting evolution , concluding that the shell would execute damped oscillations about a final static radius , as the mechanical energy of the shell is transferred to the gravitational field , and radiated away .",
    "this conclusion , however , has been challenged in a recent paper by nakao and kurita @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors analyze some constraints that the einstein equations for the system would impose on the possible final state of the evolution , starting with msrf , and conclude that a static solution could not be reached from a certain set of msrf data .",
    "this result would imply , for instance , that if the system started with that type of msrf data then it could not reach a static configuration , and would expand forever , something that could not happen in the newtonian limit , and therefore , we would be confronted with a new type of instability , resulting from the interaction of the shell with the dynamical part of the gravitational field .",
    "this , if correct , would indeed be a very surprising and unexpected feature of the dynamics of this system , since it has a simple , well defined newtonian limit , where _ all _ motions are bounded , as a result of the corresponding newtonian potential being unbounded as one moves further and further away from the symmetry axis , and it is not easy to understand in what way the radiative modes could modify this feature so drastically .",
    "it is for that reason that we considered important to provide a different analysis of the evolution of msrf data , in order to either confirm the results of @xcite , and try to find a possible interpretation , or on the contrary , provide arguments , and possible proofs , in favor of the original qualitative view of that evolution , as discussed in @xcite . as we shall show , although there are no errors in @xcite , their result is a consequence of a particular assumption on the behaviour of the gravitational field at late times that needs to be revised .",
    "once this is done we find no conflict between an arbitrary msrf initial data and a corresponding final static configuration , confirming the conjecture in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider msrf data that is initially close to the static configuration , and , using some results obtained in @xcite , prove the stability of the evolution .",
    "we further apply a numerical integration procedure and obtain the detailed evolution of the system up to large times , finding somewhat unexpected features in the approach of the shell to its final static radius , that are described and discussed in the text below .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section we review the formulation of the apostolatos - thorne model and of its equations of motion . in section iii",
    ", we recall the definition of msrf initial data , and its relation to the conserved intrinsic parameters of the shell .",
    "next we find the static solution that corresponds to the same set of intrinsic parameters , and find the relation between the initial state free parameters and those of the final state .",
    "this leads to a relation between the initial and final forms of one of the metric functions that was claimed in @xcite to lead in some cases to a contradiction with the equations of motion .",
    "however , as we show in the appendix , this result is a consequence of an inadequate use of a general expression for the solution of the wave equation with cylindrical symmetry , and we prove the existence of solutions of the field equations that satisfy the relations that make _ all _ initial msrf data compatible with a static final state . in section iv we consider small departures from the static configuration , in the sense that the initial radius is close to the corresponding static radius , analyze the resulting linearized equations of motion , and , making use of a result obtained in @xcite , prove the absolute stability of the evolution of msrf data close to the static solution .",
    "we also show that , contrary to a simple expectation , the final approach to the static configuration , for fix radial coordinate , is very slow , with the appropriate quantities approaching zero only as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the proper time on the shell . since the previous derivations give no information on the detailed evolution of the shell and the fields , in section v we use a numerical integration procedure , developed in @xcite , to visualize , for some particular examples , the evolution from the initial state , up to large times .",
    "we find for the shell , as expected , an initial exponentially damped oscillatory stage , but , in agreement it our analysis in section iv , not about the final static radius , but rather about a position that approaches the static radius as @xmath2 .",
    "we end the paper with some comments and conclusions , as well as comments on related work by other authors , in particular to that of reference @xcite .",
    "the apostolatos - thorne model @xcite describes the dynamics of a self gravitating cylindrical shell of counter rotating particles .",
    "both the inner ( @xmath4 ) and outer ( @xmath5 ) regions of the shell are vacuum space times with a common boundary @xmath6 . the corresponding metrics may be written in the form , @xmath7 where the @xmath8 sign corresponds to the outer , and @xmath9 to the inner regions .",
    "the functions @xmath10 , and @xmath11 depend only on @xmath12 and satisfy the equations : @xmath13 @xmath14\\ ] ] the shell is located on the hypersurface @xmath6 given by @xmath15 , where @xmath3 is the proper time of an observer at rest on the shell .",
    "we may interpret @xmath16 as playing the role of a gravitational field whose static part is the analogue of the newtonian potential .",
    "the time dependent solutions of ( [ ateq2 ] ) represent gravitational waves ( einstein - rosen ) .",
    "equation ( [ ateq2 ] ) is the integrability condition for eqs .",
    "( [ ateq3 ] ) .",
    "the coordinates @xmath17 and the metric function @xmath10 are continuous across the shell @xmath6 , while @xmath18 and the metric function @xmath11 are discontinuous .",
    "smoothness of the spacetime geometry on the axis @xmath19 requires that @xmath20 , @xmath10 finite at @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the junction conditions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 through @xmath6 require the continuity of the metric and specify the jump of the extrinsic curvature @xmath23 compatible with the stress energy tensor on the shell .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath6 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the shell is characterized by @xmath26 .",
    "if we assume that the shell is made up of equal mass counter rotating particles , the einstein field equations on the shell may be put in the form , @xmath27 @xmath28 where the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the proper mass per unit killing length of the cylinder and the angular momentum per unit mass of the particles . the other quantities in ( [ ateq5],[ateq6 ] ) are given by , @xmath31 @xmath32 where a dot indicates a @xmath3 derivative , and we also have , @xmath33   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac { r^2 \\psi^-_{,n } x^-}{r^2+e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}j^2 } -\\frac{\\lambda r^2 x^-}{(r^2+e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}j^2)^{3/2 } } + \\frac{j^2 e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}x^-x^+}{r(r^2+e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}j^2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these equations together with ( [ ateq2],[ateq3 ] ) determine the evolution of the shell and of the gravitational field to which it is coupled .",
    "the set of equations of the previous section may , at least in principle , be solved as an initial plus boundary ( plus matching conditions ) problem .",
    "namely , we expect that given appropriate initial data , there should be a well defined evolution to the future of that data .",
    "an inspection of the equations indicate that such initial data could be specified on a space like hypersurface formed by taking a constant time @xmath34 slice on @xmath5 and a constant time @xmath35 slice on @xmath4 , matched through a constant @xmath3 section of @xmath6",
    ". the independent data on @xmath5 would then be the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , since these specify @xmath38 and @xmath39 up to a constant .",
    "similarly , on @xmath4 , we may give arbitrary expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are then defined up to a constant .",
    "we need also to specify some initial data for the shell , which could the ( independent ) values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and fix some of the constant parameters such as @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "all these data is constrained in part by the matching conditions on @xmath6 .",
    "notice also that if we require regularity on the axis @xmath46 we need to impose @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . in the rest of this paper",
    "we shall only consider data and evolutions satisfying these requirements .",
    "+ a particular family of initial data for the model , recently considered in @xcite , was introduced by apostolatos - thorne in @xcite , and identified as the _ momentarily static radiation free ( msrf ) initial data_. it is defined as follows .",
    "we notice that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath3 are defined up to arbitrary additive constants .",
    "we may therefore consider the points on @xmath6 corresponding to a given value of @xmath3 , say @xmath51 , and the corresponding hypersurfaces of constant @xmath49 and @xmath50 that are matched to @xmath6 at @xmath51 , and assign also @xmath52 and @xmath53 to those hypersurfaces .",
    "next we impose , @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58    notice that these conditions imply , @xmath59    a particular shell is described by fixed values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the matching conditions then impose constraints on the parameters that appear in ( [ equ01 ] - [ equ05 ] ) .",
    "these may be written as , @xmath60    @xmath61    and , @xmath62    the set ( [ equ06 ] - [ equ08 ] ) constrains the free parameters , and to a certain extent , their ranges . for instance , from ( [ equ06 ] ) and ( [ equ07 ] ) we find , @xmath63 and one can check that , for fixed @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath30 , @xmath29 is a monotonic function of @xmath66 that satisfies the constraint @xmath67 for @xmath68 .    in any case",
    ", there are many ways of handling these constraints .",
    "we may , for instance , assume that we fix @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the initial radius @xmath64 . the value of @xmath66",
    "could then be chosen freely , and we would use ( [ equ06 ] ) and ( [ equ07 ] ) to obtain the corresponding values of @xmath69 , and @xmath65 . then eq.([equ08 ] ) determines the initial acceleration of the shell , and the initial data set is complete . in their original work , apostolatos and",
    "thorne noticed that in the newtonian limit , a similar self gravitating shell , released from a momentarily static configuration , namely , with vanishing radial velocity , would undergo periodic oscillations about a particular static ( `` equilibrium '' ) configuration , fixed by its intrinsic parameters @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "they therefore assumed that in the corresponding general relativistic problem , the shell would also execute oscillations about some `` equilibrium '' radius , but that now these oscillations would be damped as the system loses its mechanical energy through the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "this conclusion , however , appears to be contradicted by the recent analysis by nakao , et .",
    "@xcite , based on the properties of the evolution equations for the fields , that leads to the conclusion that for at least a subset of this type of initial data , contrary to the assumptions in @xcite , the system becomes unstable when the gravitational waves are taken into consideration , indicating , if correct , a surprising and rather drastic difference with the corresponding newtonian problem .",
    "we need here to emphasize that no explicit example of the detailed evolution of the system under the msrf initial data has been presented so far in the literature , and that the conclusions in @xcite were obtained under certain assumptions on the behaviour of the fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 that , as we shall show , need not hold in the actual evolution of the system .",
    "going back to the system ( [ equ06 ] - [ equ08 ] ) , and the evolution equations , we notice that if we further impose the condition @xmath72 , we find a solution of the evolution equations where @xmath73 , and the fields take the form ( [ equ01 ] -[equ04 ] ) for _ all _ times , i.e. , we have a _",
    "static _ solution .",
    "( hence the name msrf for this type of initial data ) .",
    "since , as indicated , @xmath74 are defined up to an arbitrary constant , we may choose @xmath75 for the static configuration .",
    "now , suppose that we have some msrf initial data .",
    "if we assume that the evolution of this msrf initial data leads ( asymptotically ) to a static configuration , can we find a relation between the msrf data and the final static data ?",
    "we recall that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants of the motion , but there is also , for this type of initial data , another constant quantity , given by the coefficient @xmath65 .",
    "this constancy is analyzed in the appendix , but here we proceed assuming that @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath65 are the same for the msrf initial data and for the final static configuration .",
    "in particular , we assume that for the final state configuration we have , @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    this form can always be achieved with some appropriate choices of additive constants in @xmath74 , plus the regularity conditions for @xmath46 . with these choices ,",
    "the matching conditions and evolution equations imply , @xmath79    @xmath80    and , @xmath81 which contain also some of the same parameters that appear in ( [ equ06 ] - [ equ08 ] ) . therefore , these relations impose conditions and constraints on both the initial and final parameters characterizing the corresponding data . directly from ( [ equ06a ] - [ equ08a ] ) we find , @xmath82 and we notice that these imply a further restriction on the range of @xmath29 , namely , for any choice of @xmath83 and @xmath30 we have @xmath84 .",
    "this , however , is not a physical restriction on the data , but rather a consequence of our choice of the value of @xmath10 on @xmath6 for the final state . but this choice imposes restrictions on @xmath66 . to analyze these we introduce @xmath85 , such that , @xmath86 so that @xmath85 gives a measure ( and orientation ) of the departure of the msrf configuration from the static configuration .",
    "we notice now that ( [ equ08 ] ) may be written in the form , @xmath87 then the sign of the initial acceleration of the shell will depend on the sign of the term in parenthesis on the right of ( [ equ12 ] ) . to find the relation between this sign and that of @xmath85 we may use ( [ equ11 ] ) , ( [ equ06 ] ) and ( [ equ07 ] ) to find , @xmath88 where , @xmath89    now it is easy to check that the right side of ( [ equ13 ] ) is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath90 for @xmath91 , that diverges as @xmath92 , is equal to one for @xmath93 and decreases to , @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "but this means that @xmath96 ( and , therefore , @xmath97 ) for @xmath98 , when the acceleration is positive , while @xmath99 ( and @xmath100 ) for @xmath101 , when the acceleration is negative .",
    "thus , we conclude that the initial acceleration is always directed towards the corresponding static radius . notice that for @xmath93 we have @xmath102 , implying @xmath103 and , therefore , @xmath75 , that is , the static configuration .",
    "we consider now the function @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , we want to compare its value at some fixed @xmath105 for the msrf data , with that of the assumed final static configuration at the same @xmath105 , since both depend on @xmath105 only through the term @xmath106 , and we have , @xmath107 and , finally , @xmath108 where @xmath90 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ equ14 ] ) .",
    "but , from the previous results , for @xmath97 we have @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , while for @xmath100 we have @xmath111 , and @xmath112",
    ". therefore , for @xmath113 we must have , @xmath114 while for @xmath115 we must have , @xmath116    this last result , that the function @xmath71 must increase for @xmath115 to reach the final static configuration , was considered in @xcite to be in contradiction with the properties of the evolution equations for @xmath11 , and therefore , was considered to imply that in that case the system could not reach a static configuration , implying some sort of instability , possibly related to the dynamic modes of the gravitational field . however , as we show in the appendix , ( [ equ22b ] ) is perfectly compatible with the field equations , and there is no _ a priori _ contradiction with the presumed existence of a static final state . + in the next section we analyze the case where the shell position for the msrf data is close to static configuration for the same shell .",
    "in this case we may consider a linearized expansion about the static configuration and apply some recently obtained results on the dynamics of the apostolatos -thorne model @xcite .",
    "we consider again the msrf data , assume that we have chosen the appropriate constants so that we have @xmath117 for @xmath51 , and write it the form , @xmath118 where @xmath85 , @xmath66 , and @xmath69 are some constants , and we have included the auxiliary parameter @xmath119 to indicate which quantities are of first order .",
    "the set ( [ lapp01 ] ) corresponds to an exact msrf data set .",
    "we are interested in the case where we have a small departure from the static configuration of the shell , namely , in the limit @xmath120",
    ". we may therefore expand ( [ lapp01 ] ) to first order in @xmath119 , and consider the resulting set as initial data for the linearized equations of motion for the shell .",
    "these were obtained in @xcite",
    ". briefly stated , one first writes the dynamical variables @xmath44 , @xmath121 and @xmath70 in the form ,    @xmath122    where the parameter @xmath119 defines the order of the terms , so that the static solution is recovered for @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath124 satisfy the equations , @xmath125 then , to first order in @xmath119 one has , @xmath126 where @xmath65 and @xmath127 satisfy ( [ equ10 ] ) , and , one finds that it is consistent to this order to set , @xmath128 in fact , only the zeroth order terms in @xmath129 appear in the linearized equations , and , instead of ( [ gleq01 ha ] ) , one has , @xmath130 where , @xmath131 these equations describe the dynamics of the radiative part of the gravitational field .",
    "the corresponding linearized equations for the motion of the shell are , ( see @xcite for details ) , @xmath132 corresponding to the matching conditions , and an equation of motion for @xmath133 , @xmath134    it was shown in @xcite that associated with the solutions of the system of linearized equations there exists a positive definite constant of the motion given by , @xmath135 dr \\\\ & & + { \\frac { { r_{{0}}}^{8 }    } { 2\\left ( { r_{{0}}}^{2}+{j}^ { 2 } \\right )   \\left ( 2\\,{j}^{2}+{r_{{0}}}^{2 } \\right ) ^{2}{j}^{2 } } }   \\int_{r_0}^{\\infty}\\frac{r}{2}\\left[\\frac{(2 j^2+r_0 ^ 2)^4}{r_0 ^ 8}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\chi_3}{\\partial \\tau}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\chi_3}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 \\right ] dr   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to apply these results to our problem we expand ( [ lapp01 ] ) to first order in @xmath119 to obtain the corresponding initial data for @xmath133 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "the results are , @xmath138 where @xmath85 and @xmath124 are not independent , but we have the relation , @xmath139    if we apply now this data to compute @xmath140 at @xmath51 we find , @xmath141 and therefore , we must have @xmath142 for all @xmath3 , and the motion of the shell is always bounded , proving the ( linear ) stability of the shell under msrf initial data . moreover , since for @xmath143 the region @xmath144 will contain outgoing radiation , we expect a steady decrease in the maximum amplitude for @xmath145 , and an eventual approach to @xmath146 , corresponding to the static solution .    the existence of @xmath140 does not provide direct information on the rate of approach to @xmath146 . to obtain this information we may proceed as follows .",
    "we first notice that after some initial transitory motion , possibly dominated by quasi normal ringing oscillations , these oscillations would damp out since all available energy for motion of the shell will eventually be radiated to infinity , as the system approaches its final static configuration . in this situation the field outside the shell would approach the situation described in the appendix , for the late time behaviour of any solution that approaches asymptotically a constant , ( eq .",

    "more generally , this implies that for sufficiently large @xmath3 , and @xmath153 , @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are constants , is an asymptotic approximation to the solution of our problem that approaches ( [ gl50a ] ) for @xmath148 . before replacing ( [ gl50 ] ) in the equations of motion",

    "as we shall show in the next section , these results are supported by a numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "in fact , for the purpose of comparison with the numerical results , it will be useful to notice that , in general we should have , @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are constants , for the @xmath105 dependence of @xmath160 for fixed @xmath147 , and , @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are constants , for the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath160 , for @xmath147 , and some fixe @xmath105 , for instance @xmath164 .",

    "the previous analysis does not give detailed information on the form in which the system , and in particular the shell , actually evolves towards a static configuration starting from msrf initial data .",
    "it is then interesting to study the initial part of this process , in particular , to see if , in accordance with the qualitative arguments of apostolatos and thorne @xcite , this approach is dominated by an oscillatory part ( quasi - normal ringing ) that dampens out as the shell approaches its final static radius .",
    "furthermore , a simple intuition would probably dictate that this oscillations are about the final static radius , effectively approaching this radius with the exponential decay characteristic of the quasi normal ringing . as we shall find in the examples analyzed below ,",
    "this is partly the case , but there are some unexpected features that appear in the evolution of the system , that are in accord with the analysis of the final approach described in the previous section .    as indicated in @xcite , it is easy to set up a numerical procedure to integrate the linearized equations as an initial plus boundary value problem , at least in a finite region of @xmath105 that includes @xmath46 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the evolution of msrf initial data for the apostolatos - thorne model .",

    ". it should be clear that we would get the same results as in @xcite if we tried to compute that limit , but , as we have tried to make clear , that limit is not the relevant one for the stability analysis .",
    "this work was supported in part by conicet ( argentina ) .",
    "in this appendix we analyze the properties of the solutions of the cylindrical wave equation , @xmath221 that are compatible with initial data such that for @xmath222 , and for @xmath223 , where @xmath64 is some constant , we have @xmath224 , and @xmath225 . by causality ,",
    "the solution for @xmath223 , and for @xmath226 , may be written in general in the form , @xmath227 where @xmath228 is a solution of ( [ ap00 ] ) that is non vanishing only for @xmath229 .",
    "it may be expressed in the form , @xmath230 where @xmath231 is also a solution of ( [ ap00 ] ) , given by , @xmath232 and @xmath216 is a function that vanishes for @xmath233 , and therefore , @xmath231 vanishes for @xmath234 .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of the solutions of ( [ ap00 ] ) given by ( [ ap01a ] ) , in the limit @xmath235 . in particular we are interested on the existence of solutions such that , for large @xmath18 , and finite @xmath105 , we have , @xmath236 with @xmath237 as @xmath238 . replacing in ( [ ap00 ] ) ,",
    "in the limit @xmath238 we should have , @xmath239 and , therefore , we must have , @xmath240      let us assume first that there exist two constants , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , such that , for @xmath244 we have @xmath245 , that is , that @xmath216 is bounded and goes to zero at least as @xmath246 for @xmath247 .",
    "then we have ,      and , since the limit @xmath238 of the last expression is zero , we find that @xmath231 must also vanish in that limit .",
    "similarly , if we consider the case where @xmath216 is bounded and we have @xmath249 for some finite @xmath242 , we are lead to the bound ,      but , again , this implies that for @xmath238 , we have that @xmath231 is bounded by an expression of the form @xmath251 , and on account of ( [ ap02b ] ) , we must also have @xmath252 in this limit .",
    "the first example includes a large family of integrable functions that are bounded and vanish for large @xmath145 , while the second includes a large family of square integrable functions that are also bounded and vanish for large @xmath145 . in all these cases",
    "we have a trivial @xmath253 as a limit .",
    "we consider next the case where for @xmath254 we have @xmath255 , where @xmath155 is constant . in this case , @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the heaviside ( step ) function . for @xmath258",
    "we have , @xmath259 and therefore , at any fixed @xmath105 , @xmath260 is finite but diverges as @xmath238 . notice that ( [ ap07 ] ) implies that there are solutions of ( [ ap00 ] ) that approach the form @xmath261 for fixed @xmath18 , with @xmath155 an arbitrary constant , but where the term @xmath156 is time dependent and diverges for @xmath262 .",
    "this result has a simple geometric interpretation .",
    "suppose we have a solution of ( [ ap00 ] ) that , for fixed @xmath105 , approaches the form @xmath263 , with a given fixed value of @xmath155 , but is zero for @xmath264",
    ". then , there will be a transition region , for @xmath265 , where the solution changes from one regime to the other .",
    "this transition region propagates outwards with @xmath18 and , therefore , represents an outgoing wave , whose amplitude , because of its cylindrical nature , must decrease along with its propagation .",
    "then , for sufficiently large @xmath18 we have a good approximation to the functional form of the solution by simply matching the form @xmath266 to zero , for @xmath267 . but",
    "this is only possible if @xmath156 is of the form @xmath268 , which is , precisely , the form given in ( [ ap07 ] ) .",
    "+ going back to ( [ ap06 ] ) , this suggests that we consider @xmath269 , with @xmath270 .",
    "we then have , @xmath271 where @xmath272 , and @xmath273 .",
    "next , we may split the integral at @xmath274 , with @xmath275 , @xmath276 for the first integral on the right hand side of ( [ ap09 ] ) , taking into account that @xmath277 , we have , @xmath278      but , this implies that for @xmath281 we must have , @xmath282 and , therefore , the integral in ( [ ap10 ] ) gives a vanishing contribution in the limit @xmath281 .",
    "similarly , @xmath283 evaluating the integral in the first and last terms , and replacing @xmath284 , @xmath285 finally , collecting results from ( [ ap10 ] ) , ( [ ap11c ] ) , and ( [ ap13 ] ) , replacing in ( [ ap12 ] ) , and taking the limit @xmath281 , @xmath286 and , therefore , @xmath287    thus we have shown that there are solutions of the wave equation ( [ ap00 ] ) of the form ( [ ap01a ] ) that approach a given constant for any @xmath105 and @xmath238 . notice",
    "that this will also be true for any bounded @xmath216 that approaches the form @xmath288 for large @xmath145 .",
    "an inspection of ( [ ap01a ] ) shows that the behaviour of @xmath216 for small @xmath145 contains the information on the wave form emitted at small @xmath18 .",
    "a further relevant result from ( [ ap14 ] ) is that for @xmath289 , and fixed @xmath290 we have the approximation , @xmath291 this result is important because it applies to any bounded @xmath216 that approaches the form @xmath288 for large @xmath145 , in the region @xmath258 .",
    "notice that , at least formally , the approximation ( [ ap15a ] ) is consistent with the vanishing of @xmath231 for @xmath292 .",
    "it indicates also that the approach of @xmath231 to the constant value @xmath155 is rather slow , as the coefficient of the @xmath106 correction term vanishes only logarithmically with @xmath18 .",
    "+ we turn now to the question of the beaviour of the function @xmath293 for large @xmath18 . in accordance with the previous results we assume for @xmath10 the form , @xmath294 where @xmath295 is an arbitrary solution of ( [ ap00 ] ) that vanishes for @xmath296 , and approaches the constant value @xmath155 for @xmath238 .",

    "clearly , the relative contributions of the last two terms in ( [ ap22 ] ) define the change in @xmath11 .",
    "as we shall see , ( and is well known ) , the last term gives always a negative contribution , but , since @xmath155 can be negative , if the values of these terms are independent , their total contribution can be positive , or negative , or even null . to reach a definite conclusion here we need to study the general properties of the function @xmath295 .",
    "we remark that @xmath295 vanishes for @xmath309 , and that we are mainly interested in the limit for large @xmath105 .",
    "we may consider now two regions for our analysis of ( [ ap24a ] ) and ( [ ap24b ] ) .",
    "the first is for @xmath310 , but @xmath311 . in this region , since in all the integrals we have @xmath312 , we have the approximations , @xmath313 while , @xmath314    then , for large @xmath105 , and in the region @xmath315 we have that the second term in the right in ( [ ap25b ] ) is small compared with the first and we have , @xmath316 therefore , in the region @xmath310 , ( [ ap25a ] ) and ( [ ap25b ] ) provide the contribution from the outgoing waves to the last term in ( [ ap22 ] ) , which , on account of the @xmath317 factor , is independent of @xmath105 for large @xmath105 . notice that this contribution is always negative .      the contribution from these terms to the last term in ( [ ap22 ] ) is then of the form , @xmath320 where @xmath321 .",
    "this result implies that the contribution from the large @xmath145 behaviour of @xmath304 to the last term in ( [ ap22 ] ) vanishes in the limit @xmath322 , and , therefore , the total contribution of this term is independent of the limiting value @xmath155 , and is dominated by the outgoing waves present in the region @xmath265 .",
