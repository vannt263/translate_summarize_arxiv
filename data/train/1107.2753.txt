    "we consider the following iterative scheme @xmath12 where @xmath3 is arbitrary and @xmath4 , @xmath2 , are i.i.d .",
    "copies of a two - dimensional random vector @xmath5 , and @xmath4 is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "writing out the above recurrence we see that @xmath13 note that although @xmath0 is not a sequence of partial sums , after renumbering @xmath4 in the opposite direction , we can write @xmath14 where @xmath15  denotes the equality in distribution and we adopt the convention that the product or sum over the empty range is 1 or 0 , respectively . much of the impetus for studying such equations stems from numerous applications of schemes like ( [ perp - nq ] ) in mathematics and other disciplines of science .",
    "we refrain here from giving a long list of fields in which equation ( [ perp - nq ] ) appeared , referring instead to some of the references we give ( most notably to @xcite for the status up to the early nineties of the past century ) for more detailed information",
    ". examples of more recent applications closer to statistics are given in @xcite , an application related to neuronal modeling may be found in @xcite and , for an application in the analysis of algorithms , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "most of the up - to - date research focused on the situation when the sequence @xmath0 converges in distribution and on analyzing properties of its limit .",
    "it has been known for a long time ( see @xcite , lemma 1.7 , or @xcite ) that if @xmath16 then the sequence of partial sums in ( [ perp - it ] ) converges almost surely and the product in the first term asymptotically vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath0 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath9 given by @xmath17 this @xmath9 , referred to as perpetuity , is of central interest .",
    "in particular , its tail behavior has been thoroughly investigated ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for more information ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a situation in which the sequence @xmath0 does not converge .",
    "we will refer in such situations to the whole sequence @xmath0 as a divergent perpetuity .",
    "we will assume throughout that @xmath11 exists but that @xmath18 under the above assumption we ask if @xmath0 can be renormed to converge in distribution to a non - degenerate limit . as is the case when @xmath0 converges ,",
    "the roles of @xmath3 and @xmath19 seem to be of much less importance than the role of @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath3 plays no significant role from now on we assume that @xmath21 . furthermore , assuming that @xmath20 is non - random would lead to @xmath0 being a sequence of sums of independent random variables .",
    "since this situation has been extensively studied , we will exclude it from our considerations by assuming from now on that @xmath20 is non - constant .",
    "on the other hand , we freely impose moment conditions on @xmath19 when necessary , or sometimes even assume that it is of a special form . for example , if @xmath22 , then ( [ perp - it ] ) is just a partial sum of successive partial products of i.i.d . copies of @xmath20 . while there is very little known technical connection , it is perhaps worth mentioning that an analogous problem of investigating the asymptotic properties of the consecutive products of partial sums @xmath23 has been intensely investigated in the past several years ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "as @xmath24 is concave , assumption ( [ mu ] ) implies that necessarily @xmath25 .",
    "( we do not assume , however , that @xmath26 is finite . )",
    "thus there are at least four situations to consider , namely ,    @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 non - random ,    @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 random ,    @xmath30 and @xmath28 ,    @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these cases are discussed in detail below and we will show that in each of these situations @xmath0 can be renormed ( each time differently ) so that it converges in distribution to a non - degenerate limit .",
    "as was brought to our attention by a.  iksanov , some particular cases of ( ii ) and ( iii ) were studied by rachev and samorodnitsky @xcite who , for non - negative @xmath19 and @xmath20 and under the assumption that @xmath32 belongs to the @xmath33-stable domain of attraction , obtained the log - stable limit law for suitably normalized @xmath0  see also comments on this connection in sections  [ ( ii ) ] and  [ ( iii ) ] .",
    "furthermore , weak convergence in the situation complementary to ( [ mu ] ) is considered in @xcite where , for non - negative @xmath19 and @xmath20 , it is assumed that @xmath34 , but the perpetuity is divergent because @xmath35 .",
    "in this section we consider the following situation : for a fixed @xmath36 let @xmath37    [ prop : sym ] let @xmath20 be as above .",
    "assume that @xmath38 and that it is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "symmetric case : let @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the sequence of i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath43 .",
    "asymmetric case : suppose @xmath44",
    ". then we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a symmetric bernoulli random variable ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 and @xmath46 and @xmath49 are independent .",
    "the sums of the form @xmath50 considered in part ( i ) are well - known objects , usually referred to as symmetric bernoulli convolutions .",
    "their properties have been extensively studied since mid-1930s .",
    "in particular , it is known that the limiting distribution is uniform on @xmath51 $ ] if @xmath52 , singular if @xmath53 and absolutely continuous for almost all ( but not all ) @xmath54 . a good description of the current state of knowledge can be found , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "proof of theorem  [ prop : sym ] we have @xmath55 if @xmath39 then the sequences @xmath56 are identically distributed .",
    "thus , if we normalize @xmath57 by @xmath58 , we get @xmath59 since @xmath60 the series of partial sums converges almost surely and thus @xmath61 converges in distribution to the given limit .    if @xmath62 then the distributional equality in ( [ eq : dist_rad ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "however , we can write the right - hand side of ( [ eq : rad ] ) as @xmath63 since @xmath64 we get @xmath65 where @xmath66 fix arbitrary @xmath67 .",
    "then , for any @xmath68 , write the term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : tn ] ) as @xmath69 the second summand is bounded in absolute value by @xmath70 and thus it can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath67 sufficiently large .",
    "consequently , we consider only the first part of the above expression .",
    "note that @xmath71 depends on @xmath72 only .",
    "therefore upon conditioning on @xmath73 we obtain @xmath74,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the characteristic function of the product @xmath76 . since @xmath77 if and only if the number of @xmath78 s such that @xmath79 is even , we have @xmath80\\\\[-8pt ] & = & ( p - q)^n,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which vanishes as @xmath81 .",
    "thus the product @xmath82 converges in distribution to @xmath46 ( recall that its characteristic function is @xmath83 ) . therefore for arbitrary fixed @xmath67",
    "@xmath84    as @xmath85 the sum @xmath71 converges almost surely to @xmath49 . by the lebesgue",
    "dominated convergence it follows therefore that @xmath86 the latter being the characteristic function of @xmath87 , with @xmath46 and @xmath49 independent .",
    "this proves  ( [ eq : as ] ) .",
    "in this section we assume that @xmath88 and that @xmath29 is random .",
    "this forces @xmath28 , but it may be infinite . set @xmath89",
    ". then we have    [ prop : rand|m| ] let @xmath0 be given by ( [ perp - it ] ) with the pair @xmath5 satisfying @xmath90 , , and @xmath8 .",
    "a.   as @xmath81 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a standard normal random variable",
    ". b.   assume @xmath93 and @xmath94 and define for real @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "then we have @xmath98 where @xmath46 is a symmetric bernoulli random variable independent of @xmath92 .",
    "the first part of this theorem overlaps with theorem  2.1 in @xcite where , for non - negative @xmath19 and @xmath20 and under the assumption that @xmath99 is in the domain of attraction of an @xmath33-stable law , @xmath100 , the authors obtained with @xmath101 replaced by an @xmath33-stable random variable and suitable normalization of @xmath0 on the left - hand side ( the normalizing constants are the constants implied by the definition of a domain of attraction ) .",
    "proof of theorem  [ prop : rand|m| ] consider @xmath57 given in ( [ perp - exp ] ) and factor the product of @xmath102 s to write it as @xmath103 consider the first factor . by the classical clt @xmath104 to finish the proof by slutsky s theorem it suffices to show the second factor on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : rand|m| ] ) converges to 1 in distribution . to this end note that @xmath105 is a perpetuity generated by @xmath106 .",
    "since we are working under the condition @xmath27 , we have @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , by our assumption on @xmath19 , @xmath108 and thus @xmath109 converges in distribution to , say @xmath110 ( see @xcite , theorem  1.6(b ) ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath111 and hence by theorem 1.3 of @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite , lemma  2.1 ) it follows that the distribution of @xmath110 is continuous . in particular , @xmath112 does not have an atom at zero , which is all that is important for our purposes .",
    "denote by @xmath113 and @xmath114 the distributions of @xmath115 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "we want to show that @xmath116 .",

    "now we take an arbitrary @xmath120 .",
    "then again we fix some @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    "we obtain @xmath121)\\ge \\nu_n([0,x^{\\sqrt{m}}])\\stackrel{n\\to\\infty}{\\longrightarrow}\\nu ( [ 0,x^{\\sqrt{m } } ] ) \\stackrel{m\\to\\infty}{\\longrightarrow } 1\\ ] ] so that @xmath122 for @xmath120 and it follows that @xmath123 , which completes the proof of part ( i ) .",
    "to prove part ( ii ) let @xmath124 and consider again @xmath125 where @xmath109 is defined by ( [ eq : invperp ] ) . by definition of @xmath126 , @xmath127 for any @xmath128 write the sum in the exponent of ( [ eq : normrn ] ) as @xmath129 splitting the product of signs on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : normrn ] ) in two factors , and using the above equation , we see that ( [ eq : normrn ] ) can be written as @xmath130 where @xmath131 in such a way that @xmath132 . to this end , consider the first sum in the exponent above .",
    "its variance is @xmath133 , and thus as long as @xmath132 it goes to 0 in probability by chebyshev s inequality .",
    "furthermore , under the same condition on @xmath134 , @xmath135 and thus the second term in the exponent above goes to 0 in probability as well .",
    "( note that the sum of @xmath136 converges in distribution to @xmath137 by the classical clt . )    as for the other factors in @xmath138 , just as in part ( i ) , @xmath139 as , where @xmath140   denotes the convergence in probability .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath141 . to this end , note that the equation ( [ eq : invperp ] ) defining @xmath109 holds a.s . and not only in distribution and thus the sequence @xmath109 is a sequence of partial sums .",
    "hence , by the basic convergence result for perpetuities ( see , e.g. , @xcite , lemma  1.7 ) , the conditions @xmath142 and @xmath108 suffice for the a.s .",
    "convergence of the series @xmath143 this , together with the fact that the limit of @xmath144 has a continuous distribution function ( see an argument following ( [ eq : invperp ] ) ) , clearly implies that @xmath145 ( and a.s . ) as @xmath146 .",
    "this proves our claim about @xmath147 .",
    "we now go back to ( [ eq : rnm ] ) and note that the first two random variables on the right - hand side are independent .",
    "furthermore , the product @xmath148 converges in distribution to a symmetric bernoulli random variable @xmath46 ( see ( [ eq : symb ] ) above ) as long as @xmath149 . hence , if the sequence ( [ eq : normrn ] ) converges in distribution , then its limit , say @xmath150 , has to satisfy the distributional identity @xmath151 , with @xmath152 independent on the right - hand side .",
    "this would complete the proof since any such @xmath150 is symmetric and we would have @xmath153 where the second equality follows by part ( i ) .",
    "thus , it remains only to prove that the sequence given in ( [ eq : normrn ] ) does , in fact , converge in distribution .",
    "we note that this sequence is tight because the sequence of absolute values @xmath154 converges in distribution to @xmath155 by part ( i ) .",
    "we will complete the proof by showing that every converging subsequence of ( [ eq : normrn ] ) converges to the same limit , namely @xmath156 .",
    "let @xmath157 be any subsequence for which @xmath158 converges in distribution .",
    "define @xmath159 by tightness we can choose a subsequence @xmath160 of @xmath161 for which @xmath162 converges in distribution .",
    "since @xmath163 we have @xmath164 it is readily seen from the construction that @xmath165 and that it converges to infinity",
    ". therefore , @xmath166 as @xmath167 .",
    "thus , if @xmath150 and @xmath168 are the limits in distribution of @xmath158 and @xmath162 , respectively , then the above identity implies that @xmath169 , where @xmath46 and @xmath168 are independent .",
    "it follows that @xmath150 is symmetric and thus must satisfy ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "since @xmath150 was a limit along the arbitrary converging subsequence of @xmath170 , the proof is complete .",
    "to see the difference between the current situation and the preceding one , note that because @xmath30 the perpetuity defined by ( [ eq : invperp ] ) in the course of the proof of theorem  [ prop : rand|m| ] is not guaranteed to converge .",
    "specifically , consider the following example : let @xmath49 be a  non - degenerate , integrable , symmetric random variable and set @xmath171 .",
    "then , @xmath172 where the strict inequality follows from the non - degeneracy of @xmath49 . by the symmetry of  @xmath49 , @xmath20 and @xmath173",
    "have _ exactly _ the same distribution . hence",
    ", if we take @xmath22 in ( [ perp - it ] ) and ( [ eq : invperp ] ) we find that @xmath174 for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath109 converge or diverge in distribution simultaneously . if @xmath20 is non - negative this difficulty can be handled by factoring the largest product in ( [ perp - it ] ) rather than the last one ; however , the limiting distribution will no longer be lognormal .",
    "it seems very likely that the case of general @xmath20 is similar , however it remains open .    before stating our result in the non - negative case , recall that a function @xmath175 is regularly varying at infinity with index @xmath176 if for every @xmath177 @xmath178 recall also that any such function can be written as @xmath179 where @xmath180 is slowly varying at infinity ; that is , for every @xmath177 @xmath181 it follows from that definition in particular that for any @xmath182 , @xmath183 as @xmath184 ( see  @xcite for these and much more on regularly varying functions ) .",
    "the following holds true :    [ thm : elnm=0 ] let @xmath5 be given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 satisfies @xmath188 ( so that @xmath189 ; @xmath190 , but may be infinite ; and @xmath191 ) .",
    "a.   if @xmath192 then , as @xmath193 @xmath194 where @xmath195 , the absolute value of the standard normal random variable , has distribution given by @xmath196 b.   let @xmath197 be a tail function of a random variable @xmath198 and define a  sequence @xmath199 by @xmath200 if @xmath201 is regularly varying at infinity with index @xmath33 for some @xmath202 then , as @xmath81 @xmath203 where @xmath204 has frchet distribution @xmath205 given by @xmath206 c.   assume that @xmath201 is regularly varying at infinity with index @xmath207 , that is , that @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is slowly varying at infinity . if @xmath210 , then ( [ elnm=0:max ] ) holds , while if @xmath211 then ( [ elnm=0:sum ] ) holds .",
    "\\(1 ) the only case not covered by the above theorem is @xmath207 and @xmath212 .",
    "we suspect that in that case , at least when @xmath49 and @xmath198 are independent , we have @xmath213 where @xmath204 is a frchet random variable with parameter @xmath214 , @xmath215 is the variance of @xmath49 and @xmath204 and @xmath92 are independent , but we have not managed to prove it .",
    "\\(2 ) part of theorem [ thm : elnm=0 ] overlaps with theorem 2.1 of @xcite , where the authors worked under the assumption that @xmath49 is in the domain of attraction of an @xmath33-stable law , @xmath216 , but assumed additionally that @xmath49 and @xmath198 are independent . under a suitable normalization that agrees with ours for @xmath217 and results in a slightly weaker condition on @xmath198",
    "than @xmath218 , they obtained as a limit law the distribution of a supremum of the l ' evy @xmath33-stable motion on @xmath219 $ ] . a similar comment applies to the second part of ; we assume the regular variation of the tail of @xmath198 but not independence of @xmath49 and @xmath198 as was assumed in @xcite , theorem  2.1 . when @xmath217 , the assumptions about the decay of the tail of @xmath198 in both papers are identical",

    "subadditivity of the maxima implies that for any numerical sequences @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 to prove part ( i ) we note that @xmath231 indeed , for @xmath232 we have @xmath233 where the last assertion follows from @xmath218 . using this and ( [ eq : subad ] ) with @xmath234 and @xmath235",
    "we obtain that @xmath236 where @xmath237 denotes a quantity that goes to zero in probability .",
    "furthermore , our assumptions on @xmath102 s imply that @xmath238 is a sequence of partial sums of random walk whose increments @xmath239 have mean zero and a finite variance @xmath240 .",
    "thus , the erds  kac theorem for the maxima of random walks ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , theorem  12.2 ) implies that @xmath241 just as in the proof of theorem  [ prop : rand|m| ] , to complete the proof we need to show that the second factor in ( [ eq : elnm=0 ] ) converges to 1 in distribution .",
    "but that is clear since , on the one hand , @xmath242 and , on the other hand , we clearly have @xmath243 this implies that @xmath244 and proves part ( i ) .",
    "the argument for the second part is parallel to the one just given with the following adjustment : in the first part , the assumption @xmath218 ensures that the maximum of the random walk with increments @xmath239 , @xmath245 , dominates the maximum of @xmath246 .",
    "if this assumption is weakened this may no longer be true , and , in fact , the maximum of @xmath247 s may dominate . in that case , we can just use the basics of extreme value theory ( chapter  1 of @xcite being more than enough ) instead of the erds  kac theorem to complete the argument .",
    "this time , using ( [ eq : subad ] ) we write @xmath248 by the characterization theorem in the extreme value theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite , theorem  1.6.2 ) , our assumption on @xmath198 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of constants @xmath249 , @xmath250 for which @xmath251 where @xmath204 has the frchet distribution ( also referred to as a type - ii extreme value distribution ) described above .",
    "furthermore ( see @xcite , corollary  1.6.3 ) , we may take @xmath252 and @xmath253 , @xmath2 , and , if we do , we obtain that @xmath254 we now observe that @xmath255 .",
    "in fact , there exists @xmath256 such that @xmath257 for all sufficiently large @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath259 is decreasing it is enough to see that @xmath260 .",
    "but as @xmath259 is regularly varying , we have @xmath261 if we now take @xmath262 ( which is possible since @xmath202 ) then @xmath182 and the numerator on the right - hand side goes to infinity with @xmath258 , proving the claim that @xmath263 for large @xmath258 .",
    "we now get @xmath264 and also , since @xmath255 , @xmath265 which proves the second part .",
    "finally , the last part follows by essentially the same reasoning .",
    "assume @xmath266 as @xmath184 .",
    "by the just - given argument , to establish ( [ elnm=0:max ] ) , it suffices to verify @xmath255 as @xmath81 .",
    "assume this is not the case .",
    "then there exist @xmath267 and an infinite subsequence @xmath268 such that @xmath269 for all @xmath270 . by the definition of @xmath199",
    "this means that @xmath271 , that is , that @xmath272 .",

    "now , it follows from the proof of the first part that @xmath275 is enough to conclude ( [ elnm=0:sum ] ) .",
    "the proof of part ( iii ) is completed .",
