    "main belt comets ( mbcs ) are objects that are dynamically indistinguishable from main belt asteroids , but which exhibit comet - like activity due to the sublimation of volatile ice @xcite .",
    "to date , six such objects have been discovered @xcite .",
    "mbcs are important because they represent a new reservoir of comets in the solar system , and may give insights into the role of main - belt objects in the primordial delivery of water to the earth as well as provide constraints on the composition of the protosolar disk .",
    "dynamical simulations performed by @xcite show that it is unlikely that present - day objects with main - belt orbits originated in the kuiper belt , assuming the current configuration of the major planets .",
    "this indicates that mbcs are likely native to the main asteroid belt .",
    "still , @xcite show that during the early violent dynamical evolution of giant planet orbits , as required by the so - called nice model @xcite , some icy trans - neptunian bodies may have been implanted in the asteroid belt .",
    "it is expected that most of these objects are located in the outer belt , but they might be found anywhere with semi - major axes larger than about 2.6  au .    numerical simulations performed to assess the dynamical stability of mbcs suggest that the orbits of the currently known objects are stable , indicating that they are likely native to their current locations @xcite .",
    "the only exception is p/2008 r1 ( garradd ) , which appears to be dynamically unstable @xcite .",
    "these simulations did not take into account non - gravitational effects ( e.g. , the yarkovsky effect ) , however , that may play an important role in the long - term stability of the mbcs .    wherever mbcs originate from",
    ", their activity , although still not reliably understood , is likely triggered by the impact - excavation of subsurface ice @xcite because completely exposed surface ice is unstable against sublimation at their heliocentric distances over gyr time - scales .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , this hypothesis is in reasonable agreement with the present - day impact frequency in the main belt .",
    "thermal modelling by @xcite and @xcite shows that buried ice on a main - belt comet can in fact survive over the life of the solar system .",
    "however , while thermal devolatization may not preclude the existence of present - day ice ( and therefore mbcs ) in the main asteroid belt , there is the additional problem of collisional devolatization .",
    "each time an impact triggers activity in a mbc by exposing a small amount of subsurface ice to direct solar heating , that particular area of the surface is effectively devolatilized once that ice has sublimated away . using estimates of the active areas required to produce the activity observed for mbcs , hsieh ( 2009 ) determined that the observed activity was most likely triggered by approximately metre - sized impactors . using work by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it was then estimated that impacts by objects of this size in the main belt should occur roughly every @xmath4  yrs . over gyr time - scales ,",
    "the cumulative effect of such impacts could be to devolatilize a significant portion of the surface of an ice - bearing asteroid .",
    "more deeply buried ice could persist , safe from both thermal and collisional depletion , but would also therefore be inaccessible by activity - triggering impacts .",
    "such asteroids would then be just as unlikely to exhibit activity in the present day and be identified as mbcs as other non - ice - bearing asteroids .",
    "because of these reasons , it is important to understand the dynamical environment of each mbc and any possible links to collisionally - formed asteroid families .",
    "asteroid families are believed to originate in the catastrophic disruption of large asteroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are a fascinating and challenging subject in themselves . a few tens of families have been discovered to date across the main belt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing insights into the collisional history of the main belt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disruption events over a size range inaccessible to laboratory experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mineralogical structure of their parent bodies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and many other subjects .",
    "previous analyses show that three of the six currently known mbcs ( 133p / elst - pizarro , 176p / linear , and p/2006 vw@xmath0 ) are associated with the large and old themis family @xcite , which is thought to have formed from the catastrophic disruption of a @xmath5400  km parent body @xmath6  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "additionally , a fourth mbc ( 238p / read ) is close to the themis family in orbital element phase space , and may have once belonged to the family @xcite .",
    "more significantly , 133p has been found to additionally belong to the small and young beagle family , which is thought to have formed less than 10  myr ago @xcite .",
    "this finding is significant because , using the devolatization rate derived by @xcite , if one assumes 133p is a primordial member of the themis family , placing its age at @xmath52.5  gyr , less than 10 per cent of 133p s surface would be expected to be unaffected by impacts by the present day .",
    "in contrast , 99 per cent of 133p s surface would be expected to remain unimpacted if the object is assumed to only be 10  myr old ( i.e. , the age of the beagle family ) .",
    "this possible link to young asteroid families is supported by the finding by @xcite that p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) belongs to a small cluster that may have a common collisional origin .",
    "comet - like activity in main - belt asteroid ( 300163 ) 2006 vw@xmath0 was discovered by the pan - starrs1 survey telescope on haleakala in hawaii on 2011 november 5 @xcite , with preliminary analysis of its activity @xcite showing that it is likely to be a genuine comet ( i.e. , exhibiting activity due to sublimation ) , rather than a disrupted asteroid ( i.e. , whose activity is due to a recent impact ) such as p/2010 a2 ( linear ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( 596 ) scheila @xcite . @xcite also examined p/2006 vw@xmath0 s possible links to dynamical asteroid families and found that it is dynamically associated with the themis family , but that it may also belong to a smaller sub - group that could represent a new previously - unidentified young asteroid family .    in this paper ,",
    "we conduct a detailed investigation into whether objects dynamically linked with p/2006 vw@xmath0 in fact have a common physical origin .",
    "first , we identify members of the group using the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm )",
    ". then we use the backward integration method ( bim ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to further test the reliability of the group and to estimate its age .",
    "finally , we analyse the characteristics of this newly discovered family in greater detail .",
    "we start our investigation by identifying the objects that are dynamically associated with p/2006 vw@xmath0 .",
    "the identification of asteroid families is usually done in proper orbital element space using proper semi - major axes ( @xmath7 ) , proper eccentricities ( @xmath8 ) and sines of proper inclination ( @xmath9 ) . for this analysis",
    ", we applied the hcm @xcite to analytically - determined proper orbital elements @xcite available at the _ astdys _ web page , where we obtained elements for 398,841 asteroids ( as of january 2012 ) .",
    "the results obtained by the hcm are the same as those obtained by @xcite , although here we use an updated proper element catalogue .",
    "[ f : nfv ] shows the number of asteroids dynamically associated with p/2006 vw@xmath0 as a function of the cut - off distance , @xmath10 ( in velocity space ) , the standard metric in the hcm .",
    "an intriguing sub - grouping appears at @xmath11  m  s@xmath12 before then merging with the themis family at @xmath13  m  s@xmath12 .",
    "a complete list of asteroids that belong to this group is given in table  [ t:300163list ] .",
    "assuming that a cut - off value of @xmath14  m  s@xmath12 used by @xcite to characterize the themis family is still appropriate , the sub - group around p/2006 vw@xmath0 is formally a part of this family .",
    "however , the latter result should be interpreted with some caution because the group occupies the outskirts of the themis family .",
    "also , one should bear in mind that the cut - off value appropriate for characterizing an asteroid family tends to decrease as the number of known asteroids increases because the density of background objects becomes higher .",
    "consequently , the appropriate value of @xmath10 for the themis family may be slightly smaller today than at the time of @xcite work .",
    "this is supported by the fact that list of the themis family members produced by @xcite does not include the asteroids from p/2006 vw@xmath0 group , although most of these objects were known at that time .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the last step in our analysis of clusterings of secular angles is to check whether orbit uncertainty or the yarkovsky effect could be the reason why several stable asteroids linked to the group by the hcm do not cluster .",
    "this is done following the procedure described above in step ( iv ) .",
    "the results of this analysis , presented in the last column of table  [ t:300163list ] , show that this is unlikely for any of the objects , with probabilities below 20 per cent even in the most promising case of asteroid 2011 ub@xmath15 .",
    "thus , only 11 asteroids can be reliably associated with the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family at this time .",
    "an important step in our analysis is to estimate a level of statistical significance of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family .",
    "because our conclusion that family is indeed real is mostly based on our findings of the clusterings of secular angles , we tested an hypothesis that these clusterings , simultaneously in both angles , can occur by a chance .    in particular the following test was performed . in the same region",
    "as occupied by the p/2006 vw@xmath0 group , in terms of osculating orbital elements ( 3.025 @xmath16 3.075 au , 0.12 @xmath17 0.21 and 1.0 @xmath18 4.5@xmath19 ) , we generated 2500 uniformly distributed test particles .",
    "for these particles we followed more or less the same approach as for the members of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 group .",
    "their orbits were integrated for 10 myr and subsequently the lyapunov times were determined . then , 1900 test particles on stable orbits were selected and divided in 100 sets ( each containing 19 particles ) .",
    "for these sets we checked whether clusterings within @xmath20 and 55@xmath21 , in @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , can be found for any smaller subset with 11 objects .",
    "the characteristics of requested clusterings as well as the number of objects are the same ones as in the case of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family .",
    "also , the fact that test particles are located in the same region of the main belt as the real family members , means that the dynamical conditions are the same , e.g. differential precessions of their secular angles are very similar .    performing these tests",
    "we did not find any appropriate clustering among 100 groups formed by the test particles .",
    "a clustering in @xmath23 , within 55@xmath21 , occurs at least once per 10 myr in about 50 per cent of the cases .",
    "however , a clustering in @xmath22 , within @xmath20 , is observed only in a few cases , and none of these were at same time as the clustering in @xmath23 . from this line of evidence",
    "we concluded that probability to find simultaneous clusterings in @xmath22 and @xmath23 for any subgroup of 11 asteroids by the chance is less than @xmath24 per cent .",
    "thus , the statistical significance of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family is greater than @xmath25 per cent .      to ascertain the physical characteristics of the members of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 group ,",
    "we search for available data about their spectral types and albedos .",
    "unfortunately , little is known about these 24 objects .",
    "in particular , none of their spectral types have been determined to date .",
    "geometric @xmath26-band albedos , @xmath27 , have been determined for four objects ( table  [ t:300163list ] ) , all from wise observations @xcite .",
    "the average geometric albedo derived from these four values is @xmath28 . with their low albedos and proximity to the themis family , most of these objects are likely c - type asteroids . the asteroid 15156 has a somewhat larger albedo than the other three bodies , but considering the uncertainty of this value , its albedo is still within the range expected for c - type asteroids .",
    "spectroscopic observations are encouraged however to definitively confirm the spectral types of the members of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family , and characterize the family s level of physical homogeneity .",
    "next , we examine the dynamical characteristics of the p/2006 vw@xmath0 group and the surrounding area .",
    "the positions of the most important mmrs have been already shown and discussed elsewhere in this paper . to better understand the role of these resonances , and to check whether any connection between the dynamical characteristics of the surrounding area and the apparent structure of the group can be established , we perform the following test : in a box slightly larger ( @xmath29  au , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in osculating semi - major axis , eccentricity , and inclination , respectively ) than the one occupied by asteroids from the group , we generate 2000 randomly distributed massless test particles .",
    "the orbits of these particles are then numerically integrated for 10  myr , after which we calculate their synthetic proper elements @xcite and lyapunov characteristic exponents ( lces ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ f : lce_ae ] and [ f : lce_ai ] , where we show colour coded maps of the obtained lces as functions of particle position in proper element space .",
    "we note that the figures indicate that most of the region surrounding p/2006 vw@xmath0 in orbital element space is stable , apart from two strongly chaotic zones centred at about 3.029 and 3.075  au , corresponding to the 9j:4a and 11j:5a mmrs , respectively . between these two zones , there are also some smaller areas that are weakly unstable .",
    "these weak instabilities are caused by higher order mmrs , such as the ones shown in figs .",
    "[ f : ae2 ] and [ f : ai2 ] .",
    "somewhat larger values of the lces are also found in the immediate vicinity of p/2006 vw@xmath0 .",
    "these appear to be caused by the 20j:9a and 1j-8s+1a mmrs .",
    "however , these resonances are weak and effective only in very narrow ranges of semi - major axis .",
    "an illustrative example is p/2006 vw@xmath0 itself , which is located very close to the 20j:9a resonance , but still does not show any sign of chaotic instability .",
    "thus , we conclude that p/2006 vw@xmath0 family members are largely stable and unlikely to be significantly dynamically evolved .",
    "this conclusion is also valid for the single family member located on the opposite side of the 9j:4a resonance from the other family members , asteroid 2008 fg@xmath32 .    to develop as",
    "complete a picture of the dynamical environment as possible , we also search for the presence of secular resonances ( up to degree six ) in the region .",
    "close to the group , we find only a non - linear secular resonance @xmath33 @xcite . its location is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sec_res ] .",
    "most of the objects from the group are far enough to avoid interactions with this resonance .",
    "this seems to be also true for asteroid 2002 vu@xmath34 , the only group member located on the other side of the @xmath35 resonance ( fig .",
    "[ f : sec_res ] ) .",
    "however , due to the chaoticity of its orbit caused by the 9j:4a resonance , it is difficult to estimate its secular frequencies , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . therefore , we are unable to draw firm conclusions as to the level of influence of secular resonances on this object .",
    "finally , one family member , asteroid 2008 fg@xmath32 , appears to be inside the @xmath35 secular resonance .    to investigate this possibility , we plot the corresponding resonant critical angle @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ f : crit_angle ] .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath39 , which oscillates around @xmath40 , unequivocally confirms that 2008 fg@xmath32 is locked within the @xmath41 secular resonance . because of that , its association to the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family is less reliable , meaning that it could be an interloper .    in terms of proper semi - major axis , 2008",
    "fg@xmath32 is located significantly outside the assumed equivelocity curves shown in figs .",
    "[ f : ae2 ] and [ f : ai2 ] . the usual explanation for this would be yarkovsky induced drift .",
    "however , the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family seems to be young , and the role of thermal effects is not so obvious .",
    "the maximum possible drift speed in proper semi - major axis due to the yarkovsky effect acting on a 1  km body of @xmath42  au / myr ( see section  [ ss : bim ] ) translates into a total drift of @xmath43  au over a period of 7.5  myr . as yarkovsky induced drift",
    "is inversely proportional to the diameter of the body , for 2008 fg@xmath32 , it reduces to the maximum value of @xmath44  au since the family forming event .",
    "this value is almost one order of magnitude smaller than necessary to explain the observed displacement in @xmath7 .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that the yarkovsky effect is not responsible for this object s anomalous displacement in @xmath45 , and that 2008 fg@xmath32 could be an interloper in the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family .",
    "insights into collisional physics may be obtained by analysing the inferred ejection velocity field ( evf ) of the fragments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an isotropic evf can be computed using the well known gaussian equations .",
    "these equations define ellipses in the ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) and ( @xmath7,@xmath9 ) planes , whose shapes and orientations are controlled by two angles , the true anomaly ( @xmath46 ) and argument of perihelion ( @xmath23 ) at the epoch of break - up . to connect these two ellipses with real family members , it is necessary to estimate the position of the family s barycentre ( i.e. , its centre of mass )",
    ". then , by adjusting the values of @xmath46 and @xmath23 , and experimenting with different ejection velocity changes ( @xmath47 ) , it is possible to find values of each of these parameters that best correspond to a given family , permitting us to infer some of the properties of the evf .",
    "however , it is well known that asteroid families evolve over time with respect to their original post - impact configurations .",
    "they spread and become more dispersed due to chaotic diffusion and gravitational and non - gravitational perturbations @xcite .",
    "young families like p/2006 vw@xmath0 , however , may not have had enough time since their formation to be significantly affected by these effects , meaning that their ejection velocity fields ( evfs ) may possibly be reconstructible .",
    "the first step in attempting to reconstruct the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family s evf is to estimate a position of the barycentre of the family . in order to do this , the absolute magnitudes ( @xmath48 ; table  [ t:300163list ] ) of the members of the family are converted into diameters , @xmath49 , using the standard relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath50 measured albedos are used for the four objects for which these are available , while the average value of the measured albedos ( @xmath51 ) is assumed for all other bodies .",
    "then , assuming the same density for all objects , we estimated their masses , which are then used to derive the position of the barycentre in proper orbital element space .",
    "only the 11 objects classified as real family members are used in this calculation .",
    "the obtained barycentre position is at @xmath52  au , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the fact that asteroid 2008 fg@xmath32 may be an interloper has negligible influence on this result .    as asteroid 15156",
    "is the largest member of the family by far , the barycentre position is controlled by its position . as a consequence , the ellipses shown in figs.[f : ae2 ] and [ f : ai2 ] are shifted towards larger values of @xmath45 .",
    "this may be a result of a notably asymmetric ejection velocity field in terms of semi - major axis , caused by a large transverse velocity component .",
    "such a situation often arises from cratering events @xcite , though is sometimes observed in the cases of catastrophic fragmentation events as well @xcite , although these situations are less likely . to characterise the event which produced the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family",
    ", we estimate the size of the parent body by simply summing up the volumes of all 11 members .",
    "these volumes are obtained using the diameters listed in table  [ t:300163list ] . using this method",
    ", we calculate a nominal diameter for the parent body of @xmath55  km . from this value",
    "we estimate the largest remnant to parent body mass ratio @xmath56 to be 0.83 .",
    "a realistic value of @xmath56 is likely somewhat smaller than the value mentioned here because the diameter of the parent body estimated from known family members is a lower limit @xcite . from this evidence",
    ", we can therefore conclude that the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family was not formed in a completely catastrophic fragmentation event . at the moment",
    "though , it is not possible to distinguish whether the formation of the family should be classified as a cratering or partially catastrophic event . in any case , the ratio @xmath56 is high , and may be an explanation for observed asymmetry in the evf .",
    "alternatively , the calculated position of the barycentre may be wrong .",
    "it may be affected by exclusion of unidentified family members from our calculations . while the chance that any of eight stable asteroids which do not exhibit clustering belong to the p/2006 vw@xmath0 family is quite small , the status of the five unstable objects remains unclear .",
    "inclusion of these objects in the calculation of the barycentre position moves it to @xmath57  au , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this case , the ejection velocity field becomes even more asymmetric than before .",
    "the inclusion of these 5 objects would additionally decrease the @xmath56 ratio .",
    "this would make the explanation that the asymmetry of the evf is a result of the impact event even less likely .",
    "thus , we believe that at least some of the unstable objects associated to the group by the hcm are not real family members , but we are unable to draw a firm conclusion at this time .    finally , despite being currently fairly stable , asteroid 15156 could have experienced some small displacement due to chaotic diffusion as it is very close to the slightly chaotic area centred at 3.055  au ( fig .",
    "[ f : lce_ae ] ) .",
    "thus , it may have been less stable in the past , but then evolved onto its current stable orbit due to chaotic diffusion and/or the yarkovsky effect .",
    "even an exceptionally small amount of yarkovsky induced drift of the semi - major axis would be enough to drive this asteroid from an unstable to a stable region ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath60 is about @xmath43  au for 7.5  myr .",
    "hence , the position of the barycentre might not be fully preserved .",
    "the last characteristic of the evf that we want to draw attention to is a notably larger spread in the inclination than in the eccentricity ( roughly by about a factor of @xmath61 ) .",
    "this could not be related to the position of the barycentre .",
    "of course , it could be easily explained by a large vertical velocity component of the evf ( see the two ellipses shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ai2 ] ) .",
    "such situations are reported earlier ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but to better understand the possible reasons for this , identification of additional family members is necessary .",
    "hence , we postpone this analysis for a future work .",
    "if the cluster of asteroids surrounding p/2006 vw@xmath0 does in fact have a common physical origin , this object would join 133p as the second mbc to be associated with a young collisional family , supporting the hypothesis by @xcite that such associations may be necessary for present - day sublimation on main - belt objects to occur .",
    "the lack of confirmed young family associations for any other mbcs does not necessarily undermine this hypothesis , as it is possible that many young families remain unidentified due to insufficient numbers of their members simply not yet being discovered , or having insufficiently well - established orbits to perform dynamical linkage analyses . as more asteroids are discovered and orbits of known asteroids are improved by current and next - generation all - sky surveys ( e.g. pan - starrs ) , it will be important to continue to search for small clusters of dynamically related asteroids , particularly around known mbcs , that may be previously unidentified young families .",
    "meanwhile , now that the results of our application of the bim indicate that the p/2006 vw@xmath0 group is likely a real asteroid family , it will be beneficial to provide observational confirmation of this dynamical result .",
    "very little information about the spectral characteristics of asteroids belonging to this newly identified family is currently known . as such , we encourage physical characterizations of the members of this family , either photometrically via broadband colours or spectroscopically , to help assess the plausibility of them being physically related in addition to be dynamically related . furthermore , since family members are expected to share physical properties , the fact that p/2006 vw@xmath0 has been observed to exhibit cometary activity apparently due to the sublimation of volatile ice @xcite , optical surveys for similar activity among its fellow family members may also be useful in the ongoing search for more mbcs .",
