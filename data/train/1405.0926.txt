    "we describe the general properties of the burgers equation and its relation to the heat equation via the well - known cole - hopf transformation . in section [ ex ]",
    "we give explicit examples of differential - algebraic and @xmath0-ansatz solutions of the heat equation and the corresponding burgers equation solutions .",
    "in this paper we address the problem of finding some special solutions of the one - dimensional heat equation , that is the equation @xmath16 note that , in this equation and in all equations we will consider further on , the variables @xmath17 and @xmath15 are graded with @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the rescaling @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant , @xmath23 , brings to its more general form @xmath24    the name of this equation is due to the fact that it describes the variation in temperature @xmath25 over time @xmath17 in some interval parametrized by @xmath15 . in quantum mechanics",
