    "since the seminal paper of moriss and torne @xcite where it was shown that the wormholes with the two mouths and a throat can exist in the nature but require the specific `` exotic '' matter to support them , wormholes attracted considerable interest in the realm of classical and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the most interesting kind of wormholes , called traversable wormholes , allows traveling through their throats , and thereby makes it possible to span large distances or even travel to other universes @xcite .",
    "yet , wormholes can not be formed as a result of a star s collapse , and , to construct the traversable wormhole one has to violate null energy condition , the weakest of the conditions a `` good '' classical system should obey .",
    "this condition , however , are known to be violated for quantum systems and even for scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "a unified view on wormholes says that wormholes are objects in the same line as stars and black holes : stars are made from normal matter , black holes are `` made '' of vacuum , wormholes are made of exotic matter .",
    "that is why sometimes the wormholes are called `` exotic stars '' @xcite .",
    "considerable interest to traversable wormholes was stipulated also by possibility of closed time - like curves , i.e. time machines in the wormhole background .",
    "thus different formulations of chronological protection were made within the above context .",
    "if one considers the possibility of existence of wormholes seriously , one should investigate such properties of wormholes as stability , interaction with external fields , and , response of wormholes to external perturbations .",
    "if they exist , the wormholes should produce micro - lensing effect on point sources @xcite , and very large wormholes can produce even macro - lensing effect @xcite .",
    "recently , the traversable wormholes have gained interest due to possible interpretation within the extra dimensional randall - sundrum scenario @xcite .",
    "that is the simplest brane - world scenario with a warped bulk geometry , the two brane model , where a pair of four dimensional branes live in a five - dimensional bulk with negative cosmological constant . in the four - dimensional effective theory approach @xcite",
    ", the traversable wormholes connect the branes and the wormhole solution can be obtained as a 4-dimensional effective solution with non - trivial radion @xcite .",
    "the above wormhole solution was first obtained in @xcite within the einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "its stability against monopole perturbations has been recently proved in @xcite . yet ,",
    "as far as we are aware , the response of a wormhole to external perturbations was not investigated so far .",
    "the response of a stable wormhole should represent some damping oscillating signal which can be decomposed , with laplace transformation techniques , into a set of modes , at least at late times .",
    "we shall show in the present paper that these modes are similar to the ( quasi)normal modes of black holes @xcite , which have been extensively investigated recently in classical gravity and string theory @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal modes ( qnm ) of black holes are important because they dominate in the intermediately late time decay of a perturbation and do not depend upon the way they were excited .",
    "quasinormal modes of black holes depend only on the parameters of a black hole and are called therefore the `` footprints '' of a black hole ( for more recent references on black hole qnms see @xcite ) .",
    "they are called quasinormal because they are analog of normal modes of a closed system . the black hole , and , in the same fashion",
    ", the wormhole is an open system : the damping gravitational waves induced by initial perturbations give rise to the lost of energy of a black or wormholes .",
    "the time - independent problem for perturbations of a wormhole turned out to be quite similar to that for a black hole : one has to find the solutions of the wave - like equations which satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions , which we shall discuss further in details .    in this paper",
    "we considered the decay of monopole perturbations of the traversable wormhole solution which naturally appears in the effective theory approach of the randall - sundrum two brane model and in the einstein theory with non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "we find the quasinormal frequencies which govern the decay of the perturbations at intermediately late times by three different approaches : pschl - teller approximation , wkb approach , and by characteristic integration .",
    "all three approaches show good agreement .",
    "in addition we found the profile of a response signal in the time domain and observed that at asymptotically late times , when quasinormal modes are suppressed by the so - called `` tails '' , the perturbations decay according to the law @xmath1 as @xmath2 approaches infinity .",
    "the traversable wormhole we shall consider here is described by the one - parameter family of solutions : @xmath3 \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where the scalar field @xmath4 obeys @xmath5 this solution appears when dealing with the einstein - hilbert action of the form @xmath6 thereby implying the equations of motion : @xmath7 @xmath8 the metric ( [ metric ] ) can be interpreted as the induced metric on the brane when considering the tensionless vacuum branes compactified on an @xmath9 orbiforld , which implies the following bulk ansatz : @xmath10 in this case the bulk warp is absent .",
    "when considering the branes with tension , due to the presence of the bulk warp , the induced metric on the positive tension and negative tension branes @xmath11 , @xmath12 are no longer identical : @xmath13    the linear perturbations of the background metric ( [ metric ] ) and of the scalar field ( [ scalar_field ] ) , generally have the form : @xmath14 @xmath15 in @xcite it was shown that it is appropriate to analyze the perturbations in the gauge where the scalar field perturbations decouple from that of the metric , namely to take @xmath16 note that according to spherical symmetry @xmath17 .",
    "after simple algebra one can reduce the perturbation equation to the wave - like form : @xmath18 \\psi = 0 .",
    "\\label{time_indep_eq}\\ ] ] where the tortoise coordinate is @xmath19,\\ ] ] and the effective potential has the form @xcite : @xmath20 this effective potential , similarly to the black hole potential ( see fig . [ fig_potential ] ) has the form of the potential barrier which approaches constant asymptotic values at both infinities . note also that the monopole perturbations of the above wormhole were previously considered in @xcite in the gauge where @xmath21 , and the scalar field perturbations can not be decoupled from those of the metric . in that gauge ,",
    "contrary to the suggestion of @xcite about possibility of infinitely growing modes , the consideration in @xcite shows that the metric is stable and that the gauge @xmath21 is not suitable for stability analysis .",
    "note also , that the effective potential does not depend on the parameter @xmath22 and , thereby , the stability analysis in @xcite is valid , in particular , for the case @xmath23 , corresponding to the so - called bbmb black hole @xcite .",
    "let us start from definition of quasinormal modes for black holes in asymptotically flat space - time .",
    "quasinormal modes of black holes are defined as the solutions of the time - dependent version of eq .",
    "( [ time_indep_eq ] ) which satisfy both boundary conditions which requires the purely out - going waves at spatial infinity and purely in - going waves at the event horizon .",
    "these modes are indexed by a set of ( usually ) complex frequencies @xmath24 .",
    "the requirement of purely out - going waves at spatial infinity is natural : at asymptotically far and flat region a passive observer does not emit waves @xcite .",
    "another interpretation of quasinormal ( qn ) boundary conditions at infinity is the requirement of resonance for @xmath24 , i.e. the requirement of divergence of the reflection amplitude @xcite .",
    "also it is natural to forbid waves coming from the event horizon .",
    "the qn boundary conditions may also change if a black hole is immersed in some cosmological background , such as de sitter @xcite , or anti - de sitter @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , for an asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes , the effective potential is divergent at infinity , and the dirichlet boundary conditions are more appropriate @xcite .    for the wormhole we have qualitatively different",
    "situation , yet leading to the same boundary conditions as those for black holes .",
    "the effective potential with respect to the tortoise coordinate , being a potential barrier which approaches constant values at both infinities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but has no longer exponential asymptotic at @xmath25 as it takes place for black holes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_potential ] ) .",
    "note however that now `` minus infinity '' corresponds to `` our '' spatial infinity and `` plus infinity '' corresponds to the other asymptotically flat region which is separated from our space - time by a bridge .",
    "the natural qn boundary conditions for both infinities are the requirement of purely out - going waves into both infinities . thus no waves are coming from both asymptotically flat regions : @xmath27 note that @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is chosen to be positive .",
    "the above boundary conditions for wormhole make it possible to use the wkb @xcite and pschl - teller approaches @xcite previously developed and used for black holes @xcite .",
    "thus we find the quasinormal modes of the wormhole within three different approximations : pschl - teller formula , wkb formula in the 6th order beyond the eikonal approximation @xcite and in all previous orders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_wkb ] ) , and characteristic integration @xcite .",
    "all approaches shows good agreement for the fundamental overtone which is the dominating in the signal . that is why the frequency found through the characteristic integration of the response drown in time - domain is so close to the value for the fundamental overtone obtained in the frequency domain ( see table [ qnm ] ) .",
    "lcccc & & + & re(@xmath31 ) & -im(@xmath31 ) & re(@xmath32 ) & -im(@xmath32 ) +   + wkb ( 6th order ) & 0.1344 & 0.08717 & 0.08759 & 0.323312 +",
    "pschl - teller & 0.1398 & 0.10825 & 0.13975 & 0.32476 + time evolution & 0.1323 & 0.09760 & - & - +    if one would like to compare the qn modes of a wormhole with those of a black hole , then the immediate question is : which model of a black hole is adequate for such a comparison ?",
    "the black hole coming from the same solution ( [ metric ] ) when @xmath23 probably is not a good candidate , since corresponding black hole @xcite has the topology of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole , thereby representing very specific case .",
    "moreover , monopole perturbations of such black hole are governed by the effective potential eq .",
    "( 49 ) of @xcite , which is isospectral to the effective potential for the considered here wormhole ( we checked also numerically that both potentials correspond to the same qn modes ) .",
    "nevertheless , one should distinguish the quasinormal spectrum of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite from that discussed here , since in the present case we have the new type of perturbations : the perturbed scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "this , certainly totally changes the qn spectrum .",
    "alternative simple choice for comparison of a black hole and a wormhole within spherical symmetry , is , ordinary schwarzschild black hole . from the above data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_potential ] , fig .",
    "[ fig_wkb ] and table [ qnm ] ) , one can learn that the quasinormal modes of a wormhole is considerably different from those of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the wormhole qn modes have much greater oscillation frequency under the damping rate of the same order , thus the ratio @xmath33 is larger for a wormhole , that is , the considered wormhole is much better oscillator then a schwartzschild black hole of the same mass .",
    "it is certainly unclear whether this feature of the wormhole is stipulated by the specific type of matter supporting the wormhole ( scalar field ) , or is generic for wormholes .    at",
    "asymptotically late times the perturbation decays according to a power law : as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_decay ] the late time tail is obeying the low : @xmath1 .",
    "this is different from the schwartzschild black hole late time behavior , where the power law for the @xmath34-th multipole is proportional to @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 for the dominating gravitational multipole , and @xmath37 for the monopole scalar field perturbations .",
    "note that for metric perturbations of the schwartzschild black hole , the first ( and the second ) multipole is not dynamical and corresponds to the infinitesimal change of mass .",
    "it is well understood then , that the striking difference in perturbations a black hole and a wormhole is that the monopole perturbations of a wormhole become dynamical , and since they correspond to the lowest multipole index , one can suggest that they will dominate over contributions of higher multipoles in a wormhole quasinormal ringing , as it takes place for black holes .",
    "in the present paper the evolution of perturbations of a wormhole space - time has been investigated for the first time .",
    "we have shown that the evolution of a wormhole response has the same stages as that of a black hole , i.e. includes the quasinormal ringing and power - law asymptotically late time tails .",
    "we suggest that these main features of the evolution of the wormhole response , are not stipulated by specific matter supporting wormholes but are generic for different wormholes .",
    "we were limited here by a monopole perturbations and consideration of higher multipole perturbations seems to be promising problem . also , consideration of the influence of quantum effects , like hawking radiation , onto classical ( quasinormal ) radiation @xcite is beyond the scope of this paper .",
