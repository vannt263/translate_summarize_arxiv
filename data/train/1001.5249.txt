    "to introduce and place the ideas of the present contribution in context , consider the paradigmatic problem of estimating the volume @xmath0 of a given region as shown in figure  [ fig : illustration ] . in its most rudimentary form ,",
    "mc estimates of @xmath0 proceed using the `` hit - or - miss '' idea , whereby the user designs a reference region of known volume @xmath1 that fully overlaps with @xmath0 , and draws random points uniformly distributed in @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] , top panel ) .",
    "an estimate of @xmath0 can then be obtained from @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fraction of such points that fall inside @xmath0 . as is immediately apparent",
    ", the efficiency of this simple method hinges upon the amount of overlap between the volumes @xmath1 and @xmath0 : the tighter @xmath1 bounds @xmath0 , the more the hits and hence the better the quality of the estimate .",
    "conversely , bounding volumes that have little overlap with @xmath0 give rise to more misses than hits and hence to large errors in the estimate .",
    "this poses a major obstacle to the implementation of such methods , especially in cases where it is difficult to guess the precise location of the volume and its boundaries , often leading to the design of an unnecessarily conservative ( large ) reference region , and hence to very inefficient estimates of @xmath0 .    despite its simplicity , the above example captures the central issues pertinent to integral estimation problems in general , for which more sophisticated methods exist @xcite .",
    "notably , in most efficient monte carlo techniques for normalizing constant or free energy estimation , a suitable family of intermediate integrands is required to interpolate between the two desired integrands ( or between the available reference system and the integrand of interest , in absolute integral estimation ) , the extent of overlap between the integrands dictating the efficiency of the methods much like in the example above @xcite .",
    "such requirements become particularly daunting when the integrands in question are highly concentrated in unknown and disparate regions of configuration space , as is typically the case in most interesting physical problems , thereby demanding substantial user insight prior to the applicability of such methods .    in the present contribution",
    ", a new family of mc integration strategies that can greatly alleviate the demand for such types of insights will be introduced . as expressed by the central results underpinning these methods , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : z_1st ] ) and ( [ eq : z_2nd ] ) , the integrals of interest ( @xmath4 , eq .  ( [ eq : z ] ) ) are computed individually , thus fundamentally departing from the aforementioned alternatives that rely on ratios of similar integrals . at the core of these new strategies",
    "is the use of integration spaces of enlarged dimensionality ( `` replicas '' ) , a concept already widely invoked to speed up markov chain simulations ( parallel tempering @xcite , evolutionary monte carlo @xcite , etc . ) , combined with the replacement of reference integrals by normalized transition matrices @xcite ( also known as transition functions @xcite or kernels @xcite in the markov chain literature ) .",
    "two main variants will be presented : the first , more physically intuitive , requires a fluctuating number of replicas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] , bottom panel ) ; the second , more abstract but also more easily adaptable to existing replica simulations , uses a fixed number of replicas along with `` virtual '' insertions / deletions of replicas .",
    "these two variants are complementary to each other much like grand - canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) and widom s test particle insertion method in simulations involving chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "to see how in principle the simultaneous use of multiple configurations ( replicas ) allows for the absolute computation of integrals , let us go back to the volume estimation problem of fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] . as illustrated in the bottom panel of that figure , the volume @xmath0 of interest can be estimated by equilibrating it with an infinite reservoir of ideal gas particles ( replicas ) of density @xmath5 , and measuring the average number @xmath6 of particles inside @xmath0 , to obtain @xmath7 .",
    "this physical idea can be implemented computationally by means of a generalized form of the usual grand - canonical monte carlo method @xcite , where the particle reservoir is at density @xmath5 ( or , equivalently , at the corresponding chemical potential ) , and attempted particle insertions / deletions take place in the neighborhood of an existing particle rather than inside a fixed volume that bounds @xmath0 , that neighborhood being defined by a transition matrix @xmath8 .",
    "these are the central ideas that motivated the development of the two versions described below .    in general",
    ", we would like to estimate integrals of the type @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the support of the integral , and @xmath11 is a positive - definite function ( see below , however ) of the @xmath12-dimensional vector @xmath13 ; e.g. @xmath14 for most physical problems with energy function @xmath15 .",
    "partition functions of discrete systems , i.e. @xmath16 , can be dealt with in an analogous fashion .",
    "we are given a ( normalized ) transition matrix @xmath8 , such as those routinely used in the trial part of the metropolis algorithm @xcite ; for example , @xmath8 could be a uniform probability distribution up to some distance @xmath17 from @xmath13 ( see dashed circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] ) , or a gaussian function centered about @xmath13 . as with metropolis and other markov chain simulations ,",
    "the width of these distributions can be chosen during a preliminary run of the simulation ( see below ) .    for non - positive definite integrands",
    ", one can invoke the identity @xmath18 where @xmath4 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) , @xmath19 , and the average of the sign function of @xmath11 is with respect to points @xmath13 sampled from @xmath20 .",
    "provided they exist , both quantities on the right hand side of this identity are immediately available from the methods below .",
    "for the first version of the method , we would like to simulate a system of replicas in contact with a reservoir of ideal ( non - interacting ) replicas of specified density @xmath5 , such that each replica @xmath21 in @xmath10 independently samples the distribution @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding grand - canonical partition function is thus @xmath23 note that , unlike the traditional case where @xmath24 , here the sum starts at @xmath25 , as in the present method ( see below ) replica insertions / deletions take place in the neighborhood of at least one existing replica .",
    "provided we can simulate according to this partition function , the desired integral @xmath4 can be found from the equality @xmath26 which follows straightforwardly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) by computing each moment of @xmath27 separately .",
    "( alternatively , one can use @xmath28 or any other relationship between moments of @xmath27 and @xmath4 , and numerically solve the transcendental equation for @xmath4 ; the question of which @xmath4 estimator is more efficient will be left for future studies ) .    an algorithm that samples according to",
    "the above grand - canonical partition function goes as follows . at the beginning of the algorithm",
    "we are given at least one point @xmath29 that belongs to @xmath10 ; let us assume the general case where we already have @xmath27 replicas in @xmath10 , and let us denote the vector of coordinates of the replicas by @xmath30 .",
    "we then decide whether to insert or remove a replica , typically  but not necessarily ( see methods section)with equal probability . if the decision was an insertion , we sample a new replica coordinate @xmath31 from @xmath32 , where @xmath21 is a randomly chosen coordinate from the existing @xmath27 , and accept its insertion with probability @xmath33 except when @xmath31 lies outside @xmath10 , in which case an immediate rejection takes place . similarly ,",
    "if the decision was to try a deletion , we randomly pick a replica @xmath34 from the existing @xmath27 , and accept its deletion with probability @xmath35 where @xmath36 is @xmath37 excluding @xmath34 , and the sum over @xmath38 excludes @xmath39 .",
    "an exception is the case where only one replica remains , which is always rejected .",
    "a proof that this algorithm samples according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) follows by detailed balance ( see methods section ) .",
    "when the replicas correspond to particles inserted uniformly in a fixed volume @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath40 , the above acceptance probabilities reduce to those of ref .",
    "@xcite ( with the due mappings between @xmath5 and chemical potential , and between @xmath11 and the boltzmann factor ) . of course , it is also possible to perform ordinary @xmath41-preserving monte carlo moves on each replica before attempted insertion / deletions @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sinx ] uses this idea ) .    by repeating the above procedure a number of times",
    ", the simulation will eventually equilibrate , and the number of replicas will fluctuate about its mean value @xmath6 . if the equilibration is too slow , i.e. too few replica insertions / deletions are accepted , the width of the distribution @xmath8 about @xmath13 can be adjusted accordingly during a preliminary run , in a fashion analogous to what is done in metropolis monte carlo to keep the rate of accepted trial moves within a reasonable range @xcite . likewise ,",
    "if the number of replicas starts to grow beyond one s computational capabilities , or diminish until it hardly departs from unity , @xmath5 can be adjusted so that @xmath6 is a reasonable number consistent with one s computing power . in practice , for many - particle systems with extensive free energies ( i.e. @xmath42 ) , it is best to write @xmath43 and adjust @xmath44 instead .",
    "note that the present algorithm generalizes standard grand - canonical simulation @xcite in two crucial ways .",
    "first , it inserts and removes entire replicas of the system of interest as opposed to individual particles of a many - body system .",
    "this conceptual difference is essentially what allows one to relate moments of @xmath27 to the partition function of the system of interest ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_1st ] ) ) .",
    "second , the replicas are introduced in the neighborhood of an existing replica instead of inside a fixed region , as prescribed by the transition matrix .",
    "this allows for efficient simulation when the integrand of interest is sharply peaked about unknown regions of configuration space ( cf .",
    "[ fig : illustration2 ] ) .",
    "although the use of arbitrary transition matrices in grand - canonical simulations is known in the mathematical literature @xcite , to our knowledge the use of such ideas for integral / partition function estimation is new .",
    "the second version of the replica gas method introduces two important advantages .",
    "first , the number of replicas is constant as opposed to fluctuating , making it more convenient for parallel computing architectures , and second the replicas can be simulated at different temperatures .",
    "these features also make the method easily implemented in existing parallel tempering ( replica exchange ) simulations , thereby benefiting from the greatly enhanced equilibration rates of these simulations @xcite .",
    "the integrals of interest can then be estimated by computing two separate averages involving both the integrand @xmath11 and the transition matrix @xmath8 , as described below .    to introduce the method in its simplest form ,",
    "let us first assume that only two replicas exist ( @xmath45 ) , each of them independently sampling the distributions @xmath41 and @xmath46 , via e.g. metropolis .",
    "the integral of interest is @xmath4 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) , and @xmath47 is an auxiliary integral ; the auxiliary distribution @xmath46 is arbitrary ( for example , it could be @xmath41 itself ) , but in typical applications it corresponds to @xmath41 at a higher temperature , i.e. @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "then the following identity holds : @xmath50 \\int_\\omega dx ' \\ , t(x'|x ) \\cdot \\pi(x ' ) } { \\int_\\omega dx [ \\tilde{\\pi}(x)/\\tilde{z } ] \\int_\\omega dx ' [ \\pi(x')/z ] \\cdot t(x'|x ) } \\nonumber \\\\      & \\equiv",
    "\\frac{\\left\\langle \\pi(x ' ) \\right\\rangle_{\\tilde{\\pi},t } } { \\left\\langle t(x'|x )   \\right\\rangle_{\\tilde{\\pi},\\pi } } , \\label{eq : z_2nd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the average @xmath51 of an observable @xmath52 means that configurations @xmath13 ( @xmath53 ) are sampled from the distribution @xmath3 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , the numerator in the above result requires @xmath13 to be sampled from @xmath55 while @xmath53 is sampled from @xmath8 ( `` virtual replica insertion , '' in analogy with widom s method @xcite ) , and for each such pair of configurations one computes the value of @xmath56 .",
    "likewise , for the average in the denominator , @xmath13 is sampled from @xmath55 while @xmath53 is sampled from @xmath56 , and for each pair one evaluates @xmath8 ( `` virtual replica deletion '' ) . in the limit of infinite samples",
    ", the ratio of these two averages converges to @xmath4 as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_2nd ] ) .    for simulations with multiple replicas at different temperatures ( @xmath57 ) , one can simply combine ( i.e. sum ) the above result for each pair of replicas .",
    "thus , for the ising model results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising2d ] , the equation @xmath58 was used .",
    "the sums run over each replica @xmath59 at temperature @xmath60 , except @xmath61 .",
    "the energy function @xmath15 for a spin configuration @xmath13 is the usual ising model function @xmath62 with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the transition matrix adopted @xmath8 generates a new spin configuration @xmath53 by flipping each spin of @xmath13 with probability @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the hamming distance ( number of spin mismatches ) between the configurations @xmath13 and @xmath53 , and @xmath27 is the total number of spins .",
    "for illustrative purposes , the results of a volume estimation problem in two spatial dimensions using the version with varying number of replicas are reported in figure  [ fig : vol2d ] .",
    "this example was chosen due to its infinite support , a property that would render the use of importance sampling methods difficult , as they would require the design of a non - trivial reference volume @xmath1 with similar support and known quadrature ( recall that in principle we do not know where the integrand is concentrated , or where its boundaries are ) .",
    "the present method performs well in such circumstances without any prior information concerning the support of the integrand , by using a simple uniform transition matrix @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vol2d ] , dashed square ) .    as an application to integrals more general than simple volumes , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinx ] a representative estimate of @xmath66 is shown .",
    "note that this integrand is non - positive definite , so eq .  ( [ eq : trick ] ) was used .",
    "the quantities on the right hand side of that equation were estimated using the varying number of replicas version of the method , with the positive - definite integrand @xmath67 .    in figure  [ fig : ising2d ] the partition function of the two - dimensional ising model is computed to demonstrate the version with fixed number of replicas ( similar results are obtained with the non - fixed version ) . at low temperatures , i.e. ordered states , the replicas are densely localized about the spin - up and spin - down states , and hence a local transition matrix @xmath8 is sufficient to ensure efficient convergence of the averages .",
    "conversely , for higher temperatures close to the disordered state and above , the relevant configuration space  and hence the spread of the replicas  grows beyond the reach of the local transition matrix adopted , thus causing the averages to converge more slowly ( cf .",
    "right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration2 ] ) .    to understand such convergence issues in more detail ,",
    "consider for simplicity eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_2nd ] ) when @xmath68 ( see below for the version with varying number of replicas ) . in order for the averages in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_2nd ] ) to converge efficiently , the transition matrix @xmath8 has to be such that :    * most configurations @xmath53 sampled from @xmath8 fall in typical regions of @xmath41 for any typical configuration @xmath13 sampled from @xmath41 ( so that the numerator is not dominated by those rare configurations with high values of @xmath56 ) ; * most configurations @xmath13,@xmath53 sampled from @xmath41 fall in typical regions of @xmath8 ( so that the denominator is not dominated by those rare events that cause @xmath8 to be of appreciable value ) .    in the ising model example of fig .",
    "[ fig : ising2d ] , where @xmath8 typically flips only a few spins of @xmath13 , the low temperature estimates converge faster as typical spin configurations only differ by a few spins , thereby satisfying both requirements , while at higher temperatures close to @xmath69 and above , any two typical spin configurations differ by a substantial number of spins , and hence the requirement ( b ) is violated . adding more replicas , increasing the value of @xmath63 for higher temperatures , or using non - local transition matrices ( such as those of cluster algorithms @xcite )",
    "can alleviate the problem , but such issues will be left for future studies .    note",
    "that analogous convergence issues arise in the version with varying number of replicas .",
    "indeed , as can be seen by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ pacc1 ] ) and ( [ pacc2 ] ) , the acceptance probabilities for insertion and deletion are affected by the choice of @xmath8 much like the averages in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_2nd ] ) are affected by criteria ( a ) and ( b ) above .",
    "( a separate issue is how well the replicas explore the energy landscape . in the fixed number of replicas version ,",
    "different temperatures are used to overcome energy barriers .",
    "although replica exchange operations can be combined with the varying number of replicas method , as a proof of concept for the convergence issues above , it suffices to start a population of replicas that populate spin - up and spin - down states equally ) .",
    "as illustrated by the above example , the most attractive use of the present methods lies in problems where the integrand is sufficiently localized , so that a general - purpose , local transition matrix can be used to yield efficient results with moderate numbers of replicas .",
    "these are precisely the problems for which existing importance sampling - based methods are most demanding , and thus these methods can be seen as complementary to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration2 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the so - called `` flat histogram '' monte carlo methods @xcite are also able to bypass some of the difficulties with importance sampling strategies in some cases , especially for discrete systems .",
    "however , the required human input and scope of such integration methods are rather different : they require the existence and knowledge of suitable order parameters and their ranges ( this being particularly difficult for entropic problems , such as that of fig .",
    "[ fig : vol2d ] ) , knowledge of ground state degeneracies , and for continuum systems suffer from systematic errors due to discretization schemes , although attempts to alleviate some of these problems have been put forward @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the present contribution has introduced two variants of a novel monte carlo strategy for estimating integrals and partition functions .",
    "both versions can be seen as complementary to existing importance sampling or free energy methods @xcite , in that their utility is generally best when the integrands are concentrated in relatively small and unknown regions of configuration space . both continuum and discrete systems are equally amenable to their use . by shifting focus from importance sampling functions to transition matrices ,",
    "it is expected that these methods will encourage a change of paradigm in monte carlo integration .",
    "in this section it will be shown that eqs .",
    "( [ pacc1 ] ) and ( [ pacc2 ] ) satisfy the detailed balance condition @xmath70 according to the grand - canonical partition function eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) , the probability of observing the microstate @xmath37 is given by @xmath71 where the proportionality constant does not depend on the replica coordinates or @xmath27 .",
    "note carefully the difference between the distribution of the labeled microstate @xmath37 , corresponding to replica with label `` 1 '' being at @xmath29 , `` 2 '' at @xmath72 , etc , and that of the unordered set of coordinates @xmath73 , corresponding any replica being at @xmath29 , another arbitrary replica at @xmath72 , etc .",
    "this probability is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the sum over all possible permutations of @xmath76 .",
