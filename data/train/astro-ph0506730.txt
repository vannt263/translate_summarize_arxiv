    "am  cvn systems are an extremely rare type of cataclysmic variable with ultrashort binary orbital periods of less than about an hour . the most confident current members of this elite subclass have orbital periods in the range of @xmath010 - 65 minutes , though two more controversial cases even display 5 - 10  minute modulations ; am  cvn systems thus arguably encompass the shortest orbital periods of any known class of binaries ( e.g. , see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these systems are so compact that both binary components are probably degenerate ( or semi - degenerate ) , likely with mass - transfer from a helium - rich donor onto a white dwarf , driven by gravitational radiation .",
    "their optical spectra are distinct from typical cataclysmics : membership in the am  cvn class requires a virtual absence of hydrogen lines in their spectrum , and instead helium lines are prominent  sometimes in emission , sometimes in absorption .",
    "hydrogen is thought to be lost from the binary during a prior common - envelope phase , before the object is seen as an am  cvn .",
    "the exotic nature of the prototype , am  cvn ( with a 17 minute orbit ) , was realized in the mid-1960 s @xcite .",
    "but the passage of another three and half decades has yielded only about a dozen additional members of this class ; for example , 11 confident plus 2 controversial cases are discussed in the review by @xcite , and another likely addition is reported in a very recent telegram by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although they have thus far remained elusive , am  cvn systems have nonetheless emerged as objects of renewed interest for multiple reasons : they may serve as sites in which to study common envelope binary evolution and unusual helium - dominated accretion disks ; they are possible sn ia progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and , intriguingly , they are predicted to be one of the most commonly detected objects in upcoming gravity wave experiments like _",
    "lisa_. for example , recent estimates , based on formation and evolutionary models , suggest that @xmath1 am  cvn binaries will plausibly be detected / resolved in gravity waves by _ lisa _ @xcite .",
    "although most am  cvn systems were first recognized via their optical properties , they may also emit x - rays during evolutionary phases of substantial mass transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are also sometimes detected in the ultraviolet .",
    "indeed , two of the shortest - period , but also most controversial , candidates were noticed first by their x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the combination of multi - wavelength data sets can allow for estimates of the mass - transfer rates , and provide orbital periods and even their long - term stability in some cases . such follow - on studies play an important role in establishing the evolutionary stage of individual systems , and in testing evolutionary models .",
    "high - quality follow - up xmm - newton spectra have recently extended study of the am  cvn unusual - abundance signatures out to high - ionization x - ray lines as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among several theoretical formation scenarios for",
    "am  cvn systems ( see discussion and references in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one popular model initially involves angular momentum loss in a double - degenerate white dwarf system due to gravitational - wave radiation .",
    "this leads to a decreasing binary period until , at periods of a few minutes mass transfer begins , which subsequently widens the binary . during this interval of mass transfer",
    "the system is recognizable as an am  cvn .",
    "the youngest members of the am  cvn class are ( in this scenario ) thought to be those with the highest mass - transfer rates and shortest periods ( @xmath220 minutes ) ; they then evolve to somewhat longer periods ( a 20 - 40 minute period during an intermediate stage , then a late stage with a 40 - 60 minute period ) as the binary widens and the mass transfer rate continues to decrease .",
    "theoretical models for the evolutionary relation between orbital period and mass - transfer rates , in the presence of gravitational radiation , predict a steep relation of order @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although there have been extensive x - ray and optical investigations of many of the dozen previously - known systems ( generally yielding consistency with such evolutionary models ) , confident , global conclusions remain limited by the current very - small total sample size of am  cvn systems .",
    "the quality data and efficient large - area sky coverage of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proven excellent for finding rare objects including cataclysmic variables @xcite , and sdss is now emerging as a potentially major contributor to new am  cvn discoveries in particular .",
    "the first sdss - selected am  cvn , sdss j1240 - 0159 , was discovered in an early sdss data release by @xcite .",
    "we describe here a successful search of the sdss spectroscopic database for additional am  cvn candidates , providing basic data on 4 new candidates  a significant expansion to this rare subgroup .",
    "we also describe the results of our initial time - series arc 3.5 m ccd photometric follow - up for three of our new candidates .",
    "most notably , our 3.5 m data reveal the first example of an eclipsing am  cvn system , sdss  j0926 + 3624 ; the latter has a 28.3 minute orbital period with deep , sharp eclipses .",
    "the sdss is a multi - institutional project creating an optical digital imaging and spectroscopic data bank of a large portion of the celestial sphere , mainly in a region approaching @xmath4  deg@xmath5 centered on the north galactic polar cap .",
    "the optical data are obtained by a special purpose 2.5 m telescope , located at apache point observatory , new mexico , equipped with a large - format mosaic camera that can image @xmath6  deg@xmath5 in 5 colors ( @xmath7 ) in a single night , as well as a multifiber spectrograph which obtains the spectra of 640 objects within a 7  deg@xmath5 field simultaneously .",
    "the imaging database is used to select objects for the sdss spectroscopic survey , which will include ( @xmath8 ) spectrophotometry covering a broad ( 3800 - 9200 ) wavelength regime for @xmath9 galaxies , @xmath10 quasars , and @xmath10 stars .",
    "details on sdss hardware , software , and astrometric , photometric , and spectral data may be found in a variety of papers , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a description of the latest sdss public data release is given by @xcite .",
    "as part of the efforts of one of the sdss scientific working groups ( the  serendipity working group \" ) , we are engaged in a visual examination of a large number of sdss spectra .",
    "a recent perusal includes examination of 286,000 sdss object spectra from 470 distinct sdss spectroscopic plates , encompassing of order 2400 deg@xmath5 of sky .",
    "this visual search has found / recovered several thousand spectroscopically unusual objects , with many in the sdss collaboration contributing their expertise to classify and understand the unusual spectra , and with identifications ranging from unusual white dwarfs to extreme broad absorption line quasars .",
    "each of the 4 new sdss am  cvn candidates reported herein was found in the course of this specific recent visual search for spectroscopically unusual objects , and each am  cvn candidate shows a hallmark helium - dominated optical spectrum ; all four new sdss candidates , sdss  j012940.05 + 384210.4 , sdss j092638.71 + 362402.4 , sdss j141118.31 + 481257.6 , and sdss j155252.48 + 320150.9 , have helium in emission ( figure 1 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will usually refer to these via the shorter nomenclature , sdss  j0129 + 3842 , sdss j0926 + 3624 , sdss j1411 + 4812 , and sdss j1552 + 3201 .",
    "of course , it is their distinctive spectra which attracted attention to these candidates in this visual search of sdss spectra .    on the other hand ,",
    "such visual searches are potentially highly biased and incomplete , and so we have also examined a preliminary version of the sdss data release  4 ( dr4 ) spectroscopic database via a more quantitative algorithmic search ; this includes just over 1050 spectroscopic plates covering about 4700 square degrees , and including 640,000 object spectra .",
    "( though note that some  special plates \" added very recently to dr4 are not included . ) we queried the dr4 database to return a list of spectra in which the sdss pipeline data reduction algorithms @xcite found any emission line centered within 20     wavelength - windows around heii @xmath114686 or hei @xmath115875 ; these were the highest equivalent - width helium lines in the four am  cvn candidates found in the visual search .",
    "the queries returned cases in which the pipeline gaussian - fits to hei or heii equivalent widths exceeded 3 , if either of the two lines was detected . the algorithmic search is also limited to emission - line objects , but at least represents a quantitative and uniform search .",
    "lcccccccccc    j012940.06 + 384210.4 & 19.66 & 19.81 & 20.04 & 20.23 & 20.60 & hei 5875 & 23 & 1300 + j092638.71 + 362402.4 & 18.71 & 18.97 & 19.19 & 19.39 & 19.38 & heii 4686 & 13 & 3400 + j141118.24 + 481257.6 & 19.30 & 19.37 & 19.51 & 19.73 & 19.80 & hei 5875 & 65 & 1400 + j155252.48 + 320150.9 & 20.16 & 20.24 & 20.32 & 20.41 & 20.54 & hei 5875 & 75 & 2200 +    the algorithmic sdss spectral database queries initially returned about 19000 sdss spectra potentially having emission at wavelengths of interest for am  cvn binaries .",
    "each of these algorithmically - chosen spectra was then further examined by eye to ascertain a rough spectral type .",
    "many were quasars or emission - line galaxies , redshifted such that their emission lines fall within the wavelengths of the search windows around the hei or heii lines .",
    "three sdss am  cvn candidates initially discovered by other means fall within the dr4 spectroscopic survey area : sdss  j0129 + 3842 and sdss  j0926 + 3624 found initially in the visual perusal discussed above and reported here for the first time , as well as the previously published case , sdss  j1240 - 0159 .",
    "all three were successfully recovered via our algorithmic search , but no additional ( spectroscopically ) compelling am  cvn candidates emerged from the algorithmic search of dr4 sdss spectra .",
    "the predominance of helium emission in each spectrum displayed in figure 1 alone argues strongly for an am  cvn classification .",
    "prominent in most objects are he i 3888 , 4026 , 4471 , 5015 , 5875 , 6678 , 7065 , and 7281 ; but for sdss  j0926 + 3624 , heii @xmath114686 is also very strong .",
    "in addition , all four new am  cvn candidates show double - peaked helium emission , very likely arising from ( helium - dominated ) accretion disks . in some cases",
    ", there is evidence for a third additional , central emission  spike \" , as has been previously noted in some other am  cvn systems like sdss  j1240 - 0159 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but additional spectroscopy is needed to verify .",
    "basic optical sdss astrometric , photometric , and selected emission line data ( for the strongest helium emission line ) are provided in table  1 .",
    "of course , these am  cvn candidates are anticipated ( and confirmed in some cases ) to be variable , so the sdss photometry is only representative of the epoch of sdss images .",
    "the visual search of sdss spectra that originally revealed these four new am  cvn candidates was done without restriction on how the object was initially chosen as an sdss spectroscopic target .",
    "but in summary it is mainly the blue - object color selection sdss  serendipity \" algorithms , and secondarily the  white - dwarf \" or  hot - standard star \" sdss algorithms that have yielded the new am  cvn candidates .",
    "both the sdss  j1411 + 4812 and 1552 + 3201 spectra , as well as that of the original @xcite object sdss  j1240 - 0159 , were obtained as sdss serendipity targets .",
    "sdss  j0129 + 3842 was targeted under an early version of white - dwarf target selection for the segue @xcite extension of sdss .",
    "sdss  j0926 + 3624 was actually targeted for a spectrum as an object potentially suitable as a hot , spectrophotometric standard star , though it was also selected as a possible spectral target by both serendipity and white - dwarf algorithms .",
    "these am  cvn candidates ( not too surprisingly ) occupy blue regions of sdss color - color diagrams that also include white dwarfs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "= -0.5 in    = -0.5 in",
    "in follow - up observations , we used the spicam ccd imager on the arc 3.5 m on two partial nights in spring 2005 to observe the three of our new am  cvn candidates with accessible ras .",
    "we used non - standard on - chip binning , along with customized subframes , to reduce deadtime during individual read outs .",
    "a short time - series sequence ( spanning about 1 hour , limited by weather ) was obtained for sdss  j0926 + 3624 on ut 2005 march 16 . on ut 2005",
    "april 13 , longer time - series were obtained for both sdss  j0926 + 3624 and sdss  j1411 + 4812 , with a short time - series sequence for sdss  j1552 + 3210 .",
    "neither night was photometric , but differential photometry was obtained , relative to several slightly brighter comparison stars included in each image .",
    "we used the spicam sdss @xmath12-band filter in all cases ( as uncooperative weather did not allow sufficient time to obtain time - series in additional filters ) .    for sdss  j1411 + 4812 , we collected a ccd time - series spanning 3  hours on our april night , and comprised of mainly 40  sec individual exposures , yielding somewhat better than 60  sec time - resolution ( e.g. , with a deadtime of about 18  sec between each 40  sec exposure ) .",
    "application of lomb - scargle analysis @xcite to these time - series data reveals no significantly - detected periodic modulation for sdss  j1411 + 4812 . using monte carlo simulations to quantify ,",
    "we place an upper limit on any sinusoidal modulation of the lightcurve for sdss  j1411 + 4812 of @xmath13 ( semi - amplitude ) on timescales of 4 to 60 minutes , at the epoch of our 3.5 m observations . however ,",
    "the 3.5 m lightcurve for sdss  j1411 + 4812 does suggest non - periodic variations of typical amplitude @xmath14 mag .        for sdss  j1552 + 3204 , we squeezed in a 1.5 hour time - span sequence on our april night with the arc 3.5 m , taking 60  sec individual exposures ( with about 80  sec time - resolution ) .",
    "we also had obtained an earlier time - series ccd sequence for sdss  j1552 + 4203 , using the naval observatory ( nofs ) 1.0 m on ut 2004 june 12 ; a 4-hour time - span was covered with about 5-minute time - resolution in unfiltered light .",
    "lomb - scargle analysis reveals a possible very weak , 0.04  mag semi - amplitude modulation with a period of about 56 minutes in our 3.5 m data , or perhaps half that period in the nofs data .",
    "monte carlo analyses suggest a marginal significance of @xmath15 for this possible periodicity , though the low amplitude and significance , and the brief cycle - count of the 3.5 m observations , demand additional data to verify .",
    "for sdss  j0926 + 3624 , both the 1-hour timespan march sequence with 40  sec exposures ( and 60  sec time - resolution ) , and the longer 2-hour timespan april sequence with 20  sec exposures ( and 40  sec time - resolution ) reveal a strongly detected 28.31@xmath160.01 minute modulation , with striking eclipses ( figure  3 ) . from our april data",
    ", we estimate eclipse centers at @xmath17 .",
    "the eclipses are sharp and deep , with mid - eclipse depth of ( at least ) about 1 magnitude .",
    "a gaussian fit to the sharp portion of the eclipse duration yields a full - width at half minimum of about 40  seconds and , for example , a @xmath18 minute duration full width at 5% of the minimum eclipse depth . as our time - resolution is only of order 40  sec ,",
    "the eclipses could be even sharper / deeper .",
    "application of lomb - scargle analysis confirms this ( obvious ) period with very high confidence ( e.g. , @xmath19 significant in the april data ) .",
    "the lightcurve also shows additional reproducible structure that is seen in both march and april 2005 3.5 m data ; for example , there is a plateau just following the eclipse , and note the low - amplitude relative depression near phase 0.6 .",
    "as far as we are aware , sdss  j0926 + 3624 is the first example of an eclipsing am  cvn .",
    "our visual spectroscopic search yielded 4 new am  cvn candidates from recent sdss spectroscopic plates covering about 2400 deg@xmath5 , while the subsequent algorithmic search recovered 3 am  cvn candidates ( two of the new candidates discussed herein , as well as the roelofs et al .",
    "2004 object , sdss  j1240 - 0159 ) from plates encompassing about 4700 deg@xmath5 .",
    "we are not aware of any examples in the sdss spectral database of strong emission - line am  cvn binaries obviously missed by either visual or algorithmic searches .",
    "on the other hand , the overlap - numbers are too small to be considered definitive .",
    "accounting for the 250 plates covered both in the visual and algorithmic searches , the combined current sdss spectroscopic yield is 5 ( emission - line ) am  cvn candidates from a region encompassing about 5900 deg@xmath5 of sky .",
    "we thus estimate that spectroscopically similar am  cvn systems might be expected to be found from the sdss spectral database at a rough surface density of order 1 every 1200 deg@xmath5 .",
    "estimates of the actual surface density of sdss am  cvn binaries ( even just those with helium in emission ) are complicated in that the am  cvn candidates found thus far with sdss were chosen for spectroscopy by : ( i ) several different target selection algorithms , having differing color - selection criteria and differing limiting magnitudes ; and , ( ii ) selection algorithms ( mainly ) that in practice receive a spectroscopic fiber only when the main sdss galaxy and quasar surveys do not consume all available fibers for a given spectroscopic plate .",
    "because of such complications , we more conservatively note that enough spare spectroscopic fibers ( e.g. , for  serendipity \" targets ) generally have not been available to fully sample all potentially interesting candidates having sdss colors similar to those of the candidate / confirmed am  cvn cases .",
    "for example , if considering a small box in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 multicolor - space that barely encompasses the bulk of candidate / confirmed am  cvn binaries in dr4 imaging ( see figure 2 ) , only of order one - fifth of the similar - color objects cataloged in sdss dr4 images with @xmath23 also have available sdss dr4 spectroscopy .",
    "spectroscopic incompleteness of @xmath24 ( or even much larger ) is thus not implausible , and even just for am  cvn candidates having spectral characters similar to those presented here .    our spectroscopic recognition ( both visual and algorithmic ) of am  cvn candidates reported here relies on the detection of helium emission lines , and thus it is not surprising that the current sdss sample includes no confirmed examples of the shortest - period  high - state \" systems like am  cvn itself , which show helium predominantly in absorption .",
    "on the other hand , the predominance of strong helium emission , and the low - amplitude ( less than about 0.1 mag ) variability found for sdss  j1411 + 4812 and sdss  j1552 + 3201 on both long- and short - terms , are consistent with their being  low - state \" am  cvn systems , perhaps with orbital periods in the range of about 40 - 60 minutes .",
    "the marginal 56  minute low - amplitude photometric periodicity for sdss  j1552 + 3201 , of course , would also be consistent with this notion ; but we emphasize again that this possible periodicity should not be considered secure , pending further observations .",
    "time - resolved optical spectroscopy may well be the preferred test of ultracompact binarity in such cases , as it has also been for several other possibly - similar  low - state \" am  cvn systems including sdss  j1240 - 0159 ( e.g. , see roelofs et al .",
    "2005 , or broad discussion in nelemans 2005 ) .",
    "sdss  j0926 + 3624 on the other hand displays long - term variability ( e.g. , having varied by about a magnitude between the epochs of sdss spectra and sdss images ) , as well as the striking 28.3 minute eclipsing lightcurve reported herein .",
    "both the short orbital period , and the longer - term variability , suggest that sdss  j0926 + 3624 might be an am  cvn at an intermediate evolutionary stage .",
    "of course quality , time - resolved spectra ( in both high and low - states ) are another obvious imperative given the eclipsing nature demonstrated in this paper .",
    "as the first example of an eclipsing am  cvn , sdss  j0926 + 3624 provides an excellent potential opportunity to empirically confirm binary parameters that may be less directly obtained in the other am  cvn systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that am  cvn binary parameters , theoretically preferred in some models and/or empirically inferred for some other am  cvn systems , are at least not inconsistent with our initial sdss and 3.5 m observations and their implications for sdss  j0926 + 3624 .",
    "for example , the observed velocity ( full ) width of the heii @xmath114686 line near the continuum level is @xmath06100  km s@xmath25 ; under the assumption that @xmath26 is approximately unity in this eclipsing case , this implies a compactness parameter for the accreting primary of @xmath27 , if a keplerian disk extends to near the primary surface ( or half that value for freely falling material ) .",
    "for a zero - temperature white dwarf mass - radius relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this keplerian - disk assumption in turn then implies that the accreting primary has @xmath28 and @xmath29  km .",
    "if the heii disk emission region does not extend down to the vicinity of the primary white dwarf surface , then @xmath30 would be larger ( and @xmath31 smaller ) than these representative values .",
    "assuming that the secondary fills its roche lobe ( and adopting an approximate expression for the volume - equivalent roche lobe radius from @xcite appropriate in the case of @xmath32 ) , kepler s third law also implies that the secondary mass and radius are approximately related via @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are both in solar units in the latter expression .",
    "if the secondary in sdss  j0926 + 3624 is a degenerate helium white dwarf as is often suggested for am  cvn systems , then again invoking a zero - temperature , fully - degenerate mass - radius relation , also provides an estimate of the secondary parameters : @xmath36 and @xmath37  km .",
    "for such a system with binary separation @xmath38  km , the relative transverse velocities of the secondary and primary ( of course , predominantly due to the motion of the former ) at mid - eclipse would then be @xmath39  km s@xmath25 , and the sharp portion of the eclipse duration might be expected to be of order @xmath40  sec ( e.g. , if the sharp - portion is mainly an eclipse by the secondary of a relatively small region , such as a hot spot ) .",
    "the approximate agreement of such a simple model with the observed duration of about 65 - 85s for the sharp portion of the eclipse in sdss  j0926 + 3624 is interesting .",
    "further modeling of high time resolution eclipse data may allow constraints to be placed on non - zero temperature mass - radius relations , with various levels of degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the sharpness of the eclipses in sdss  j0926 + 3624 also suggests the long - term possibility of measuring the change in the binary orbital period , thereby constraining the mass transfer rate and aspects of gravitational radiation .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have successfully obtained such information via measures of the period derivative of the 5  minute modulations in rx  j0806.3 + 1527 ( which has also sometimes been argued to be an am  cvn system ) .",
    "accounting for the loss of angular momentum by gravitational waves in a system with two degenerates , plus conservative mass transfer via roche - lobe overflow , the anticipated period change ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for sdss  j0926 + 3624 should be of order @xmath41 .",
    "this might be expected to lead to a deviation from a linear @xmath42 eclipse - timing curve of about 1 second over a timescale of three years , a value which may be detectable with precise timing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the implied accretion rate is about @xmath43 yr@xmath25 ( assuming adiabatic , conservative mass transfer and a zero - temperature equation of state for the secondary star ) . at a fiducial distance of @xmath20.5  kpc ,",
    "the expected gravitational wave strain is @xmath44 , which is similar to the @xmath45 detection threshold of _ lisa _ ( e.g. , see recent discussions about am  cvn binaries and _ lisa _ in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary , along with the original sdss am  cvn found by @xcite , the 4 additional new sdss finds presented here",
    "provide a yield of 5 sdss am  cvn candidates thus far ; this is a substantial addition to the elite am  cvn subclass , compared to the dozen other cases previously known .",
    "two of these five sdss objects are also now strongly confirmed as ultrashort - period binaries ( sdss  j1240 - 0159 by roelofs et al .",
    "2005 , and j0926 + 3624 in this paper ) .",
    "sdss  j0926 + 3624 reported here is the first confident example of an eclipsing am  cvn . our initial approximate considerations presented above for sdss  j0926 + 3624 presage that future detailed modeling of the 28.3 minute eclipsing lightcurve and its long - term temporal stability , double - peaked spectral line profiles , and follow - on radial velocity studies and multiwavelength observations , should provide an excellent empirical testbed of various models for am  cvn systems .",

    "<S> am  cvn systems are a rare ( about a dozen previously known ) class of cataclysmic variables , arguably encompassing the shortest orbital periods ( down to about 10 minutes ) of any known binaries . </S>",
    "<S> both binary components are thought to be degenerate ( or partially so ) , likely with mass - transfer from a helium - rich donor onto a white dwarf , driven by gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> although rare , am  cvn systems are of high interest as possible sn  ia progenitors , and because they are predicted to be common sources of gravity waves in upcoming experiments such as _ lisa_. we have identified four new am  cvn candidates from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectral database . </S>",
    "<S> all four show hallmark spectroscopic characteristics of the am  cvn class : each is devoid of hydrogen features , and instead shows a spectrum dominated by helium . </S>",
    "<S> all four show double - peaked emission , indicative of helium - dominated accretion disks . </S>",
    "<S> limited time - series ccd photometric follow - on data have been obtained for three of the new candidates from the arc 3.5 m ; most notably , a 28.3 minute binary period with sharp , deep eclipses is discovered in one case , sdss  j0926 + 3624 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first confirmed eclipsing am  cvn , and our data allow initial estimates of binary parameters for this ultracompact system . </S>",
    "<S> the four new sdss objects also provide a substantial expansion of the currently critically - small sample of am  cvn systems . </S>"
