    "the axial @xmath1-symmetry of quantum chromodynamics is broken by a quantum anomaly . as a consequence",
    "the pseudoscalar singlet meson does not appear as a massless mode in the spectrum of qcd in the phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite . this phenomenon can also be understood in terms of the t  hooft determinant @xcite .",
    "it is a @xmath1-symmetry breaking @xmath2-quark interaction that gets contributions from fluctuations in the topological charge .",
    "recently , non - perturbative results for the four - quark interaction channels , and in particular for the t  hooft determinant , have become available from investigations of quenched continuum qcd with two flavours @xcite , see also @xcite .    at temperatures of roughly @xmath3 mev , qcd with @xmath4 flavours",
    "experiences a rapid crossover to a phase that approximately respects chiral symmetry and breaks center symmetry @xcite .",
    "although the situation is less clear at finite chemical potential , qualitative changes are expected also at large densities , see e.g. @xcite for reviews . at temperatures far above the crossover and also at large densities ,",
    "the effects of the axial anomaly are expected to vanish , since topological charge fluctuations become suppressed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the splitting between the mass of the pseudoscalar singlet meson and the pion could become small immediately above the chiral crossover @xcite .",
    "experimental signs for such an effective restoration of the @xmath1-symmetry have been found by @xcite , who report a drop in the in - medium mass of the pseudoscalar singlet meson of at least @xmath5 mev .",
    "a restoration of the @xmath1-symmetry would have a qualitative impact on the nature of the phase transition in the two - flavour chiral limit . in the presence of the axial anomaly in terms of the t  hooft determinant",
    "this transition is expected to be of second order in the @xmath6 universality class @xcite .",
    "if , however , the @xmath1-symmetry were restored at the chiral transition , a first order transition or a second order transition in the universality class of @xmath7 could take place @xcite .",
    "the possibility of an effective restoration of the @xmath1-symmetry has been addressed in several lattice qcd simulations .",
    "a degeneracy in the correlators of pion and pseudoscalar singlet meson has been observed in the chirally symmetric phase in a two - flavour simulation with overlap and domain wall fermions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite find effective restoration only at larger temperatures of @xmath8 mev with @xmath4 flavours of domain wall fermions and @xcite , using highly improved staggered fermions , do not see it even at @xmath9 times the crossover temperature .",
    "the phenomenological implications of the axial anomaly and different scenarios for its fate at the chiral crossover have been investigated with a dyson - schwinger approach using models for the quark - gluon interaction @xcite , in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and with quark - meson @xcite as well as linear sigma models @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use results for the energy - momentum scale dependence of the t  hooft determinant @xcite , where the functional renormalisation group ( rg ) in wetterich s formulation @xcite has been used to calculate the effective action of quenched qcd with two flavours . from this functional renormalisation group ,",
    "a coupled set of equations for the @xmath10pi correlation functions , similar to the dyson - schwinger equations , can be derived , see e.g. @xcite for reviews .",
    "additionally , we use the polyakov - quark - meson ( pqm ) model @xcite with two flavours as a qualitative description of the chiral crossover . with the help of this model",
    "we derive a mapping of the renormalisation group scale dependence of the t  hooft determinant to its temperature dependence for the investigation of the mass splitting between @xmath0-meson and pion at the chiral crossover .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : pqm2p1 ] we briefly discuss the pqm model with two quark flavours and its behaviour at the chiral crossover .",
    "section [ sec : thooftdet ] discusses the calculation of the t  hooft determinant @xcite and the derivations of its temperature dependence . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss our main result , the mass splitting between @xmath0-meson and pion at the chiral crossover and we summarise and conclude in [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the euclidean lagrangian of the 2-flavour polyakov - quark - meson model with axial symmetry breaking term has the form @xcite",

    "the mesonic potential @xmath14 is a function of the chirally symmetric operators @xmath15 and the kobayashi - maskawa-t  hooft determinant @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the latter breaks the @xmath1-symmetry and leads to a mass splitting between the ( @xmath17-@xmath18)- and ( @xmath0-@xmath19)-mesons .",
    "additionally , an explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath20 appears in this potentials which mimics a non - vanishing current quark mass .    in the pqm - model",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath21 depends only on the non - fluctuating background field @xmath22",
    ". therefore also the polyakov loop , given as the thermal expectation value of the path - ordered and colour - traced wilson loop , @xmath23\\right\\rangle_{\\beta=1/t }   \\ ; ,      \\label{eq : loopvar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] depends only on this constant background . to provide the gluonic background we use a polynomial ansatz for the effective polyakov loop potential @xmath24 @xcite with the same parameters as @xcite . since we consider only the case of vanishing chemical potential , we have @xmath25 , and the potential @xmath24 is therefore a function of @xmath26 alone .      , and deconfinement transition , @xmath26 , as functions of the temperature @xmath27 .",
    "]    we calculate the effective potential @xmath28 at finite temperature in the extended mean - field approximation @xcite which ignores all mesonic fluctuations .",
    "the remaining path integral is gaussian , leading to the determinant of the fermionic kinetic operator .",
    "it depends on the yukawa interactions which we assume to be degenerate @xmath29 .",
    "using @xmath30 at @xmath31 the result is @xmath32 where @xmath33 \\nonumber\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath34 is the quark energy .",
    "the potential is regularised with a momentum cutoff @xmath35 and then renormalised such that the correct value for the pion mass and pion decay constant @xmath36 are reproduced at @xmath37 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the t hooft determinant in this setting is trivial since the quark loop , being a function of @xmath38 only , does not induce any anomalous contributions .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-mass would show only a trivial temperature dependence which is proportional to the change in the pion mass in this effective description .",
    "once the model parameters have been fixed to yield physical values for the observables , the polyakov - quark - meson model gives a qualitative description for the qcd crossover at finite temperature . to demonstrate this , we show the order parameters in .",
    "the normalised chiral condensate shows a rapid change to a very small value around temperatures of @xmath39 to @xmath40 mev , which is the usual value found in these type of models for the temperature of the chiral crossover .",
    "the polyakov loop , @xmath26 , increases at the same temperatures , indicating a crossover to a deconfined phase of broken center symmetry .",
    "when comparing to results from lattice qcd @xcite , the crossover temperature in this model is too large by about @xmath41 mev .",
    "to some extent this can be remedied by improving the parameterisation of the polyakov loop potential and adding a strange quark @xcite , but it is still an indication for the qualitative nature of the description provided by the pqm - model . to improve its applicability",
    ", this model can be embedded in a full qcd calculation via the dynamical hadronisation technique @xcite .",
    "such an approach has been used e.g. quantitatively in quenched qcd in @xcite and qualitatively also for unquenched qcd in @xcite .",
    "we use results for the t hooft determinant from a calculation within quenched qcd with two quark flavours @xcite .",
    "this approach uses only the strong coupling strength and bare quark mass as input at perturbative momentum scales . from this input , the effective action @xmath42 $ ]",
    "is calculated in a vertex expansion by solving the wetterich equation @xcite @xmath43 = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\gamma_k^{(2)}+r_k}\\,\\partial_kr_k\\right]\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the integration of infinitesimal momentum shells , the resulting trajectory for the effective average action , @xmath44 $ ] , connects the renomalised perturbative action @xmath45=\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\lambda}\\gamma_k[\\phi]$ ] , defined in terms of strong coupling strength and bare quark mass at some large momentum @xmath35 , with the full quantum effective action @xmath42=\\lim_{k\\rightarrow0}\\gamma_k[\\phi]$ ] .",
    "the momentum - shell integration is controlled by the regulator function @xmath46 which acts as a momentum dependent mass - term .    as the momentum shell integration approaches non - perturbative momenta below @xmath47(@xmath10 ) gev , four - quark interactions are created via two - gluon exchange diagrams , e.g. @xcite .",
    "if these four - quark interactions are approximated by a momentum - independent coupling constant , chiral symmetry breaking is signalled by a singularity in this coupling .",
    "this divergence is as consequence of the emergence of the pion pole in the spontaneously broken phase . to avoid this divergence",
    ", one has to include momentum dependencies in the four - quark interaction .",
    "one possibility to do so with manageable effort is to use the dynamical hadronisation technique @xcite , see also @xcite for recent applications . in each momentum shell integration step",
    ", this technique rewrites the four - quark interactions in terms of meson exchange .",
    "this naturally includes the correct momentum dependence close to the pion pole , thus avoiding any singularities .      to be able to identify the resonant four - quark interaction channel a fierz - complete basis with ten basis elements has been used in @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of the resonant pion channel has been taken into account via the dynamical hadronisation technique .",
    "the choice of only hadronising this single channel uses the knowledge that the @xmath1-anomaly will break the symmetry between pions and @xmath0-meson .",
    "a more thorough investigation of the implications of this choice and the @xmath48-anomaly will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we are especially interested in the four - quark channel corresponding to the exchange of the @xmath0-meson ( and also @xmath49-meson ) and its difference to the pion - channel , which is directly proportional to the t  hooft determinant in the case of two quark flavours .",
    "the corresponding results for these two channels are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fourfermi ] .",
    "these results have been obtained in the truncation of @xcite and have been rescaled such that a unit residue at the pion pole is guaranteed .",
    "additionally the wave function renormalisations of pions and @xmath0-meson have been assumed to be degenerate .",
    "we clearly see that the four - quark interactions reach a considerable strength only at non - perturbative momenta . in this regime , the t  hooft determinant is almost as strong as the symmetric four - quark channel . as a consequence ,",
    "the pion channel becomes dominant , wherase the @xmath0-meson is comparably heavy .",
    "although hardly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourfermi ] , the @xmath0-pion splitting is already present at scales above the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "one possible source for this splitting is the previously mentioned asymmetric choice of only hadronising the pion-@xmath17-meson channel .",
    "as discussed already , the quark - meson model can be derived from qcd within the functional renormalisation group approach via the dynamical hadronisation technique . within this approach ,",
    "mesons are introduced as auxiliary fields .",
    "the momentum dependence of the dynamically created four - quark interactions is then rewritten in terms of the exchange of meson @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 the couplings of the four - quark channels corresponding to pion and @xmath0-meson exchange , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are therefore related to the corresponding yukawa interactions and meson masses via the relations @xmath54 which hold at each renormalisation group scale @xmath55 .    for calculating the temperature dependence of the @xmath0-meson mass we use the temperature independent approximation @xmath56 . for given @xmath57 , the temperature dependence of the meson masses , @xmath58 , is then directly proportional to temperature dependence of the corresponding four - quark interaction strength , @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , we are left with calculating the temperature dependence of @xmath60 . to do so",
    ", we assume that the temperature dependence of a given coupling strength can be mapped onto its renormalisation group scale dependence , since both quantities are energy - momentum scales .",
    "a similar approximation has been used successfully for obtaining the strong running coupling as a function of temperature and magnetic field in @xcite . to calculate the precise relation between the temperature and rg - scale dependence we use the temperature dependence of the pion mass , @xmath61 , as obtained within the pqm model .",
    "the pion mass gives us the corresponding four - quark interaction strength @xmath62 via ( [ eq : lambda ] ) with @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we use the corresponding coupling @xmath64 , obtained in the approach presented in @xcite , to relate the rg - scale @xmath55 with the temperature @xmath27 by demanding @xmath65 .",
    "this condition maps each temperature @xmath27 to a corresponding rg scale @xmath66 and we obtain finally @xmath67 from the rg - running of the t  hooft determinant @xmath68",
    "we show the temperature dependence of the mesonic curvature masses , defined by the second derivative of the effective potential , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] . at small temperatures our value for the @xmath0-mass is @xmath70 mev .",
    "this agrees within the given errors with lattice qcd which gives approximately @xmath71 mev for the corresponding pole mass @xcite .",
    "one uncertainty in our calculation stems from using the curvature mass instead of the pole mass , which is far away from euclidean momenta .",
    "furthermore , we used the assumption that the wave function renormalisation as well as the yukawa - coupling of the @xmath0-meson is degenerate with the one of the pion .    .",
    "]    at temperatures close to the crossover we see the usual behaviour of the pion and @xmath17-meson masses , which become degenerate above the transition .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0-meson shows a drop at the chiral transition .",
    "this is in accordance with experimental results for the in - medium mass @xcite .",
    "a similar drop in the @xmath0-meson mass is found in the ( @xmath4)-flavour version of the quark - meson model without temperature - dependence in the t  hooft determinant coupling @xcite . since the mesonic t  hooft determinant is of order @xmath72 in the meson field , the drop in the @xmath73-flavour @xmath0-meson mass can be attributed solely to the melting of the light condensate .",
    "the presented two - flavour case , on the other hand , requires a genuine temperature dependence in the strength of the t  hooft determinant coupling to reproduce a similiar drop .    above the chiral crossover",
    ", we still see a large splitting between the masses of the pion and the the @xmath0-meson , which is in contrast to some lattice simulations reporting a fast reduction of the mass splitting above the chiral crossover @xcite .",
    "several assumptions within our calculation can have an influence on the mass - splitting above the chiral crossover .",
    "firstly , our procedure of mapping the renormalisation group scale dependence on the temperature introduces uncertainties precisely at the chiral crossover .",
    "secondly , the restoration of chiral symmetry usually happens at too large temperatures and too slowly in the quark - meson model .",
    "consequently , the temperature points above the crossover should actually be compressed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] , which would entail a faster effective restoration of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the asymmetric hadronisation procedure used in @xcite could be responsible for a too large mass splitting in the chirally symmetric phase . in future investigations",
    ", the @xmath0-channel should therefore be dynamically hadronised as well .",
    "we have investigated the mass splitting between pions and @xmath0-meson across the chiral crossover . to this end , we have used results for the renormalisation group scale dependence of the t  hooft determinant from two - flavour quenched qcd . from these results",
    "the temperature dependence for the t  hooft determinant has been approximated by matching the temperature dependence of the pion mass in a mean - field approximation of the polyakov - quark - meson model to its renormalisation group scale dependence from the result in quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "we find a drop in the mass of the @xmath0-meson at the chiral crossover which is compatible with experimental results for the in - medium @xmath0-meson mass @xcite . in the case of two flavours ,",
    "this drop is the consequence of a genuine temperature dependence in the strength of the t  hooft determinant coupling .",
    "a large splitting between pion and @xmath0-meson mass is found at temperatures above the chiral transition .",
    "this might be caused by the slow restoration of chiral symmetry at large temperatures within the used model together with the procedure used for mapping the renormalisation group scale to the temperature .",
    "additionally , the asymmetric choice in the dynamical hadronisation procedure of @xcite and the fact that we used curvature masses instead of pole masses might play a rle .    for future investigations it would be interesting to improve the calculation @xcite with respect to axial anomaly effects and dynamically hadronise the @xmath0-meson as well . it would be interesting to include mesonic fluctuations in the pqm - model and see whether the found temperature dependence in the t  hooft determinant coupling strength is sufficiently strong to change the order of the chiral transition in the chiral limit .",
    "furthermore , a continuation of the current approach to minkowski space similar to @xcite would be desirable .",
