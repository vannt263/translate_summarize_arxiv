    "the efforts of more than two decades of exoplanet searches have produced an incredible diversity of discoveries , many of which bear little similarity to planets in the solar system .",
    "these discoveries provide valuable constraints for our theories of planet formation , which have evolved to explain the existence of the wide array of planetary systems observed .",
    "one such grouping of planets is the hot jupiters , gas giant planets in short period orbits ( defined herein as @xmath8 and @xmath9  days ) , which occur at rates of @xmath10  around sun - like field stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , more than @xmath11  years after their proposed existence @xcite and nearly @xmath12  years after the first detection @xcite , we still lack a complete description of the hot jupiter formation process .",
    "it is believed that they form beyond the snow line ( located at @xmath13  au for the current - day sun ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where there is a greater reservoir of solids with which to build a massive core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) before undergoing an inward migration process , but many questions remain to be answered .",
    "while there are many mechanisms that could cause a gas giant planet to lose angular momentum and migrate inward ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two leading ideas are dynamical interactions with a circumstellar disk (  type ii  migration ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and multi - body gravitational interactions with other planetary (  planet - planet scattering  ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or stellar ( kozai cycles ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) companions .",
    "migration through a disk must occur while the gas disk is present ( within @xmath14  myr ; * ? ? ? * ) and is expected to preserve near - circular orbits , but if multi - body interactions are the source of most hot jupiters , inward migration may take significantly longer and many of these planets should initially possess high eccentricity . for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt the language of @xcite and refer to these multi - body processes as `` high eccentricity migration '' ( hem ) . given the different timescales predicted , one direct way to distinguish between mechanisms would be to search for hot jupiters orbiting very young stars ( @xmath15  myr ) , and at least one promising candidate exists orbiting a t - tauri star ( ptfo 8 - 8695 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the enhanced activity associated with young stars presents significant challenges for such surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the dynamical imprint of hem on the orbital eccentricity could provide a more accessible means to observationally constrain migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent tidal circularization of the orbits erases this evidence of multi - body interaction over time , so identifying `` dynamically young '' systems , for which the system age ( @xmath16 ) is less than the circularization timescale ( @xmath17 ) , is necessary for such an investigation .",
    "longer period planets ( large @xmath17 ) could satisfy this requirement , but hot jupiters with periods of only a few days are both more common and easier to detect .",
    "young planets ( small @xmath16 ) offer another solution , but field stars tend to be old and their ages are difficult to estimate accurately @xcite .",
    "the ages of open clusters , on the other hand  e.g. , the @xmath18  myr hyades @xcite or the @xmath19  myr pleiades @xcite  are typically precisely known and can be comparable to ( or less than ) the circularization timescales of many hot jupiters .",
    "consequently , planets in clusters could provide an avenue to directly measure this observational signature of hem , allowing us to determine which process is most important for hot jupiter migration .    with the recent discovery of two hot jupiters @xcite in the praesepe open cluster ( @xmath20  myr )",
    ", it is now clear that giant planets can form and migrate in a dense cluster environment .",
    "this had been an open question , as previous exoplanet surveys targeting open clusters  including high resolution spectroscopy of @xmath21 dwarfs in the hyades ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p04 ) and @xmath22 dwarfs in m67 @xcite , as well as transit photometry of several other clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  had not discovered any planets .",
    "however , while small planets do appear to be a common by - product of star formation , _ giant _ planets are comparatively rare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most cluster surveys have not been sensitive to the more common smaller planets , so it is likely that small sample sizes are to blame for the null results ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , two mini - neptunes recently discovered @xcite in ngc 6811 ( @xmath23  gyr , * ? ? ? * ) by the _ kepler _ spacecraft would not have been detected by previous surveys , and the results suggest consistency between occurrence rates in open clusters and the field for planets of all sizes .",
    "while open cluster planet surveys have recently enjoyed successes in measuring planet formation rates , they have not yet provided a convincing constraint for the hot jupiter migration process , despite their potential to do so in the long term .",
    "unfortunately , the hot jupiters discovered in praesepe are too old to address timescale differences between migration mechanisms , and they are not dynamically young , either .",
    "that is , they are close enough to their stars to have already undergone tidal circularization ( @xmath24 ) . to see the dynamical imprint of migration",
    "it will thus be necessary to identify younger hot jupiters or hot jupiters on wider orbits that would still bear the signature of dynamical scattering in order to help distinguish between migration mechanisms . in hopes of accomplishing the latter , here we extend our radial velocity ( rv ) survey to include more stars with ages and properties comparable to those in praesepe .",
    "we describe our sample selection in and outline our spectroscopic and photometric observations and analysis in .",
    "we then present evidence for high eccentricity migration and a constraint on @xmath6 in , and in we discuss our results .",
    "hyades cluster members represent an ideal sample for extending our survey of sun - like stars in praesepe @xcite .",
    "the two clusters are nearly the same age ( @xmath18  myr and @xmath25  myr , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and both are metal - rich  @xmath26}=+0.13 \\pm 0.01 $ ] ( hyades , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath27 ( praesepe , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while p04 found no planets among @xmath21 hyades dwarfs ( @xmath28  fgk stars ) , a primary motivation of their survey was to explore the relationship between planet occurrence and stellar mass , so a number of fgk stars were omitted in favor of including @xmath12  m stars",
    "as a result , some suitable stars have not yet been observed with precise radial velocities .",
    "our potential targets come from a list assembled by robert stefanik for the cfa hyades binary survey ( r. stefanik 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "since @xmath29 , the cfa has been monitoring over @xmath30 stars in the hyades field , extending to a magnitude of @xmath31 .",
    "originally the program consisted of stars drawn from the hyades lists of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . over the years",
    "additional stars were added to the observing program if there was some suggestion that the stars were possible members based on photometric , proper motion , or radial velocity investigations of the cluster . also added to the cfa program were the companion stars of hyades visual binaries . from this parent list ,",
    "the sample surveyed here was determined after excluding close ( @xmath32 ) visual binaries revealed by high - resolution imaging @xcite , the @xmath21 stars previously surveyed by p04 , rapid rotators ( @xmath33 ) , faint targets ( @xmath34 ) , and spectroscopic binaries ( with orbits or long - term trends ) from the literature and the cfa survey .",

    "like other spectroscopic classification techniques , spc can be limited by degeneracy between parameters , notably @xmath358 , @xmath359 , and [ m / h ] , but in this case we can enforce the known cluster metallicity ( @xmath360 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and distance ( @xmath363  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  and enforcing the age ( @xmath18  myr ; * ? ?",
    "* ) and metallicity of the hyades , we determined the best fit mass and radius for each of the three isochrones .",
    "all three results agreed to within @xmath364 in mass and @xmath365 in radius , and although the resulting @xmath359 values indicated by the isochrones were consistent with the spectroscopically determined value , the temperatures were nominally discrepant at the @xmath366 level .",
    "it is possible that , for stars of this mass and age , the stellar models and/or spc suffer from a systematic bias not reflected in the formal errors . given that the exact stellar parameters have little bearing on the results presented in this paper , we choose to simply caution the reader and inflate the errors on stellar mass and radius by a factor of two .",
    "we adopted the mean mass and radius from the three isochrone fits ( @xmath367 , @xmath368 ) , where the uncertainties listed here are the inflated statistical errors .",
    "table  [ tab : props ] lists all of the stellar and planetary properties .",
    "we note that our adopted temperature ( @xmath369  k ) is consistent with previous estimates of the spectral type ( e.g. , k5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and using the spectral type / temperature relations assembled in @xcite , we estimate a more precise spectral type of hd 285507 to be k4.5 .",
    "since the rotation period of hd 285507 is @xmath345  days and we have estimates for @xmath317 and @xmath324 , we can in principle calculate the inclination of the stellar spin axis . in practice ,",
    "the fractional uncertainty on @xmath324 is large ( not because the absolute uncertainty is large , but because the value is small ) , and the inclination can only be constrained to be @xmath370 .",
    "this does not exclude an edge - on stellar equator ( @xmath371 ) , and because hot jupiters orbiting cool stars ( @xmath372  k ) tend to be well - aligned with the stellar spin axis ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an inclination of @xmath373 would make a transit more likely a priori .",
    "however , even an inclined stellar spin axis would not preclude transits of hd 285507 , as there is evidence to suggest that young planets tend to be more misaligned than old planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to providing a radius measurement for hd 285507b , transits of this relatively young planet orbiting a cool star could be valuable to the interpretation of these intriguing correlations .    with this in mind",
    ", we conducted photometric monitoring of hd 285507 with keplercam on the flwo @xmath374  m telescope at the predicted time of conjunction on ut 2012 november 7 .",
    "keplercam is a monolithic , 4k@xmath3754k fairchild 486 chip with a @xmath376 fov and a resolution of @xmath377 .",
    "we used a sloan @xmath378 filter with exposure times of @xmath379  s and readout time of @xmath343  s , obtaining a total of @xmath380 images over @xmath381  hours .",
    "we reduced the raw images using the iraf package ` mscred ` , and performed aperture photometry with sextractor @xcite .",
    "the resulting light curve showed no sign of a transit , but to determine our detection sensitivity , we simulated transits  using the routines of @xcite and a quadratic limb darkening law from @xcite  and injected them into our observed data .",
    "for each injected transit , we compared the mean flux in transit ( for all points between mid - ingress and mid - egress ) to the mean flux out of transit .",
    "if the two differed by more than @xmath382 , we classified that transit as detected . from this",
    ", we can rule out a central transit of objects larger than @xmath383 ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "if hd 285507b were to transit , then the derived minimum mass would be the true planetary mass . under this assumption and using the mass - radius - flux relation from @xcite , we would then expect its radius to be @xmath384 , much larger than our sensitivity limit .",
    "we can also rule out all transits of a @xmath385 planet with impact parameters @xmath386 ( i.e. , all but the most extreme grazing transits ) .",
    "using the final ephemeris , the transit center should have occurred @xmath387  hr after our observations began ( @xmath388  bjd ) , with an uncertainty of @xmath23  hr , so it is unlikely that a transit occurred outside our observing window .",
    "the discovery of a hot jupiter in the hyades open cluster brings the total number of short period giant planets in clusters to @xmath297 . of these , however , hd 285507b is unique in that it is the only one that is definitively eccentric ; the two planets in praesepe are consistent with having circular orbits .",
    "as described in the introduction , the non - zero eccentricity of hd 285507b could be a tracer of its migration history if the planet is dynamically young ( i.e. , @xmath389  myr ) .",
    "if it is dynamically old , then the orbit should have already circularized , and establishing a credible link between the eccentricity and the migration process becomes more difficult . in planet ",
    "planet scattering for example , if the outer planet gets ejected during the scattering event as is expected , then one must invoke a separate mechanism to excite eccentricity again after circularization . to put it differently , if hd 285507b is dynamically young , then planet  planet scattering is sufficient ( but not necessary ) to explain the observations ; if the planet is dynamically old , planet ",
    "planet scattering is neither sufficient nor necessary . to test these scenarios , we estimate @xmath17 using the equation given by @xcite :    @xmath390    where @xmath6 is the planetary tidal quality factor ( a measure of the efficiency of tidal dissipation within the planet ) .",
    "note that @xmath17 scales linearly with @xmath6 , which is unknown to within an order of magnitude .",
    "the jupiter ",
    "io interaction does provide the constraint @xmath391 @xcite , but @xmath6 is likely dependent upon temperature , composition , rotation , and internal structure , all of which may be quite different for hot jupiters .",
    "@xmath392 , which we adopt herein , is a fiducial value often assumed for short period giant planets ( for a more detailed discussion of tidal dissipation , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since hd 285507b does not transit , we do not know @xmath393 and measure only a minimum mass , @xmath330 .",
    "however , we can calculate the expectation value of @xmath394 for randomly oriented orbits to determine the most likely mass , and then use the giant planet mass  radius  flux relation derived by @xcite to estimate the planetary radius :    @xmath395    where @xmath396 is the time - averaged incident flux on the planet . since @xmath393 depends only weakly on @xmath397 , assuming an inclination is not likely to introduce a large radius error  there is only a @xmath398 difference in derived radius between edge - on and average - inclination orientations .    under these assumptions ,",
    "we find @xmath399  gyr  much larger than the age of the cluster .",
    "note that this holds true even for the full range of @xmath400 ( corresponding to @xmath401  gyr ) .",
    "we conclude that hd 285507b is dynamically young . while it is tempting to thus proclaim that migration has occurred via a hem mechanism , recall that this is not a necessary condition for a dynamically young planet with an eccentric orbit . for any individual planet ,",
    "non - zero eccentricity could also be the result of continued interaction with an undetected planetary or stellar companion , a recent close stellar encounter , or even modest eccentricity excitation via type ii migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". only analysis of a population of planets can provide meaningful insight into the migration process in this manner .",
    "therefore , we turn to the literature for ages and circularization timescales of the known sample of hot jupiters .",
    "to search for dynamical imprints of migration among known hot jupiters ( @xmath8 , @xmath402  days ) , we follow the prescription described above to calculate @xmath17 ( and @xmath397 and @xmath393 for non - transiting planets ) .",
    "we adopt ages , eccentricities , planetary masses and radii , and stellar masses , radii , and temperatures from the literature . in figure",
    "[ fig : tcir ] , we plot @xmath16 versus @xmath17 for this sample . while the figure is complicated by the uncertainties already discussed as well as",
    "poorly constrained ages and potential biases in measuring modest eccentricities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is a hint that the points to the right of the circularization boundary are preferentially eccentric and the ones to the left are preferentially circular . if hem were responsible for the final stages of hot jupiter migration , this would be expected ; planets get scattered inward on highly eccentric orbits and circularize over time .",
    "if type ii migration were responsible , we should expect very little difference between the eccentricity distributions to the right and left of the boundary ; ordered migration through a gas disk should largely preserve circular orbits , so subsequent tidal interactions would not change the population significantly . in figure",
    "[ fig : edist ] , we plot the eccentricity histograms and cumulative distributions for the two populations , which contain @xmath403 and @xmath404 planets ( as shown in figure  [ fig : tcir ] ) . to quantify the difference between them , we ran a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "the ks @xmath405-value is the likelihood that the two subsamples came from the same parent distribution , and in this case , @xmath406 .",
    "we conclude that the two distributions do not come from the same parent distribution , with @xmath407  confidence , and infer that high eccentricity migration mechanisms play a significant role in hot jupiter migration .",
    "we also ran an anderson  darling ( ad ) test , which is similar to a ks test , but is more sensitive to differences in the distribution tails .",
    "the ad test indicates an even greater significance that the two distributions do not come from the same parent distribution of eccentricities .",
    "as noted previously , ages and eccentricities can be difficult to determine for many of these systems , so it is important to consider what effect uncertainties may have on the significance of our result .",
    "ages of field stars can be estimated by many techniques , including gyrochronology , stellar activity , lithium abundance , and isochrone fitting .",
    "however , ages derived from multiple techniques do not always agree , and when they do agree , the allowed range of ages can still be quite large .",
    "likely for this reason , the extrasolar planets encylcopaedia does not report uncertainties on the age ( when age is reported at all ) . @xcite",
    "claim a precision of @xmath408  dex in their activity  age relation , and while not all stars in this sample have ages derived in this manner , we believe this to be an appropriate approximate error for isochrone fitting as well , which is one of the more widespread techniques employed to determine ages .",
    "we therefore adopt this as a typical error in our analysis .",
    "eccentricity errors are similarly heterogeneously reported in the literature , especially for nearly circular orbits .",
    "some authors assume zero eccentricity in such cases for simplicity , which introduces a bias toward smaller values , while others report upper limits or a measured eccentricity .",
    "when a small measured value is reported , it may be biased toward larger eccentricities depending on the details of the fitting . rather than worry about potential conflicting biases in a heterogeneous set of eccentricities and associated errors , we assume a constant eccentricity error of @xmath409 for all planets in our sample .",
    "we also assume errors of @xmath351 on stellar and planetary masses and radii , @xmath364 on semi - major axis , and @xmath410  k on stellar effective temperature .",
    "these values are minor contributors to uncertainty in the analysis , but they do have a small effect on the derived circularization timescales .    using the above errors , we redraw our sample @xmath411 times . for each of these simulated data sets ,",
    "we run a ks test to determine the significance of the difference in populations , resulting in a distribution of @xmath412-values .",
    "the median of this distribution is @xmath413 , or a @xmath414 confidence ( nearly @xmath415 ) that the two samples come from different parent distributions .",
    "furthermore , we find that even for eccentricity errors as large as @xmath416 ( which is unrealistically large for nearly all planets in the sample ) , the ks significance remains greater than @xmath417 . from this , we conclude that even with conservatively large errors , our result holds : dynamically young planets have larger eccentricities , which suggests hem mechanisms contribute significantly to hot jupiter migration .",
    "until now we have been assuming @xmath419 to determine which planets are dynamically young ( right side of the circularization boundary in figure  [ fig : tcir ] ) and which are dynamically old ( left side ) , allowing us to draw conclusions about the migration process . if we instead _ start _ with the assumption that planets migrate inward in possession of some intial eccentricity ( rather than being gently shepherded on circular orbits through the gas disk ) , we can invert the problem to place a constraint on the tidal quality factor @xmath420 .",
    "as we vary @xmath6 , the circularization boundary changes location , and the difference between the two populations should be maximized ( and the ks @xmath405-value minimized ) for the correct ( average ) hot jupiter @xmath6 .",
    "note that it does not matter what fraction of hot jupiters has undergone hem ",
    "if any fraction has , then the minimum @xmath405-value should occur when the circularization boundary is in the correct place .",
    "figure  [ fig : ks ] shows the results of this experiment .",
    "a value on the order of @xmath421 is preferred , which seems to rule out much of the parameter space consistent with jupiter s tidal quality factor ( and validates our assumption of @xmath419 ) .",
    "the discrete data points do not produce a smooth distribution , so finding the minimum is not straightforward .",
    "as such , we smooth it using a moving average with a boxcar filter of size [ @xmath422 . quantitative confidence limits on the minimum are difficult to assess ( the vertical axis is _ not _ a probability associated directly with @xmath6 ) , but we take approximate upper and lower limits on @xmath6 to be those for which the smoothed p - value is @xmath114 times its smoothed minimum value , which occurs for @xmath423 . for each simulated data set",
    "described in , we calculate @xmath6 this way and find the median to be similar ( @xmath424 ) , but with smaller errors .",
    "this is not surprising , as the statistical errors from the simulations are akin to a standard deviation of the mean whereas the errors derived from a single p - value versus @xmath6 experiment are akin to a sample standard deviation . to describe the population",
    ", we therefore adopt the latter and suggest an appropriate tidal quality factor for a typical hot jupiter is @xmath7 ( see figure  [ fig : ks ] for a visual representation ) .",
    "our discovery of a hot jupiter in the hyades bolsters the statistics of short period giant planets in open clusters ( of which three are now known ) . including the @xcite null result in the hyades ( @xmath425 planets among @xmath28 fgk stars ) , our hyades sample ( @xmath181 in @xmath426 ) , and an updated census of praesepe including unpublished data from our second year of observations ( @xmath427 in @xmath11 ) , a total of @xmath297 out of @xmath428 stars host a hot jupiter . after correcting for completeness and calculating poisson errors following the prescription in @xcite",
    ", we find a hot jupiter frequency of @xmath429 in the metal - rich praesepe and hyades open clusters .",
    "however , giant planet occurrence scales with metallicity approximately as @xmath430}}$ ] @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath26 } \\approx + 0.15 $ ]  as representative of the combined praesepe and hyades sample , the solar - metallicity - adjusted hot jupiter frequency in clusters is @xmath431 .",
    "although more discoveries are needed to reduce the uncertainty , this is in good agreement with the frequency for field stars ( @xmath432 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and improves the evidence that planet frequency is the same in clusters and the field .",
    "a primary motivation for the search for young planets is that their ages are comparable to the timescale of migration .",
    "thus , the orbital properties of such planets may still bear the dynamical signature of this process .",
    "since different migration mechanisms are predicted to produce hot jupiters on different timescales and with different orbital eccentricities , we can use the properties of young hot jupiters ( and their existence at various ages ) to determine the process by which they migrate .",
    "the ages of the cluster planets discovered thus far do not place a strong direct constraint on the _ timescale _ of migration ( we know only that the process took less than @xmath30  myr ) , but the newly discovered planet in the hyades holds a clue its dynamical history .",
    "hd 285507b has a long circularization timescale , so its non - zero eccentricity may be a remnant of the migration process , which would suggest planet - planet scattering or kozai cycles have played a role in its orbital evolution .",
    "there is no observational evidence for a third body , but one can not be excluded either .",
    "the rv timespan is not long enough to rule out a second giant planet ( which also could have been ejected during scattering ) , and imaging by @xcite only rules out companions more massive than @xmath433 with projected separations @xmath180@xmath434  au .    applying this idea more broadly , we have compared ages and circularization timescales for all known hot jupiters and find evidence for two families of planets , distinguished by their orbital properties : ( 1 ) mostly circular orbits for the `` dynamically old '' planets , those with @xmath435 , and ( 2 ) a range of eccentricities for `` dynamically young '' planets , those with @xmath436 . if type ii migration were the leading driver of hot jupiter migration , both dynamically young and old planets should have circular orbits .",
    "we thus conclude that hem is important for producing hot jupiters .",
    "however , we can only say that these planets have experienced dynamical stirring _ at some point _ , and do not suggest that this evidence shows type ii migration to be unimportant . on the contrary , as shown by simulations time and again , type ii migration is almost certainly important to orbital evolution before the gas disk dissipates , but we suggest that for a large fraction of hot jupiter systems , planet - planet scattering or the kozai mechanism is responsible for the final stages of inward migration .",
    "a larger sample of dynamically young ( non - circularized ) planets may allow us to determine what that fraction is .",
    "since few hot jupiters have circularization timescales greater than @xmath181  gyr , a good way to enhance this sample is to continue finding young planets .",
    "that hem mechanisms play an important role in hot jupiter migration has already been suggested , and is supported by a rich data set of stellar obliquity measurements in hot jupiter systems ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent discussion ) .",
    "in addition to the excitation of orbital eccentricity , dynamical encounters with a third body are expected to produce a range of orbital inclinations , although tidal interactions with the host star may realign the systems over time .",
    "these inclinations can be measured precisely , most notably via the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect @xcite , and the results of such studies parallel those presented in this paper : systems for which the tidal timescale is short tend to be well - aligned , and those for which the timescale is long display high obliquities .",
    "@xcite do caution that stars and their disks may be primordially misaligned for reasons unrelated to hot jupiters , but we see no obvious reason for this to influence the eccentricities",
    ". migration through multi - body dynamical interactions , on the other hand , could explain both the inclined orbits and high eccentricities observed in systems that have not yet experienced significant tidal interactions .",
    "whether that process is primarily planet - planet scattering or the kozai effect remains to be determined , and it is likely that more data will be needed to properly answer this question .    finally , the tidal circularization boundary that separates the dynamically young and old populations of hot jupiters is sensitive to the choice of the planetary tidal quality factor , @xmath6 , so we have leveraged this dependence to constrain the typical value for hot jupiters to be @xmath437 .",
    "@xmath6 has wide - ranging implications , e.g. , for simulating orbital evolution @xcite or modeling the inflated radii of hot jupiters @xcite , but has thus far proven difficult to constrain observationally . while our result still includes substantial uncertainty and will not be applicable to any one planet , it can be applied to these problems in a statistical sense .",
    "moreover , it offers a path forward : as our sample of longer period and young hot jupiters grows , the determination of @xmath6 using this method should improve .",
