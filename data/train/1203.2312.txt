    "observations of powerful outflows from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show that they have a considerable effect on the energy budget and morphology of their host galaxy cluster .",
    "the jets from the super - massive black hole that powers an agn inflate low density bubbles in the host galaxy cluster s intra - cluster medium ( icm ) that are observed as x - ray cavities .",
    "the minimum energy required to inflate these cavities can be as high as 10@xmath0 erg ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and typically imply a power on the order of 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 averaged over the age of the cavity ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most x - ray cavities are paired as a result of the twin agn jets that formed them , and most are filled with radio synchrotron emission from relativistic , cosmic ray electrons ( crs ) ; that is , `` radio lobes . ''",
    "absent thermal conduction , models of the icm without any heating source predict that galaxy clusters should establish  cooling - flows \" , where radiatively cooled icm plasma falls towards the central galaxy driving up star formation to very high values @xcite .",
    "observations do not show evidence of these classical cooling - flows , but in contrast they show that mass accretion onto the central galaxy is at least an order of magnitude below cooling - flow predictions @xcite .",
    "one popular explanation for regulating cooling in clusters is that energy output from the agn in the central galaxy heats the icm sufficiently to limit accretion .",
    "indeed , the enthalpy content estimated in x - ray cavities appears to be sufficient to offset cooling of the icm ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the details of the physical processes involved in the transfer of energy from agn outflows to the icm are not fully understood , it is generally agreed that these outflows contribute to the dynamics and thermodynamics of the icm .    at the same time",
    "there is also good evidence that the icms significantly affect agn outflows .",
    "for example , several radio lobes that have been observed , such as hydra a @xcite and 3c 31 @xcite , show complex morphologies with various kinks and turns .",
    "the cited authors suggested that , for these objects , the jets and lobes may be reacting to bulk motions of the icm .",
    "further , there are groups of agn - produced radio sources specifically classified by their bent morphologies ; namely , narrow - angle tails ( nats ) and wide - angle tails ( wats ) , depending on the apparent degree of bending .",
    "@xcite proposed that these objects obtain their bent shape from the relative motion through the icm of the galaxy hosting the agn engine . in the case of wats ,",
    "the low peculiar velocity of the associated galaxies in combination with reasonable assumptions for the density and velocity of the plasma within the agn outflows suggest that the motion of the icm within the cluster is more responsible for their characteristic c - shape than the motion of the individual host galaxy within the cluster ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued that cluster mergers can produce sufficient ram pressure in the icm to cause this shape , and simulations have shown that motions produced by merger events with sufficient ram pressure to bend wats are persistent for timescales exceeding 10@xmath4 years @xcite .",
    "similarly , recent simulations show large - scale icm `` sloshing '' several gigayears after a gravitational encounter with a passing subcluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "direct detection of such bulk icm flows became feasible with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _",
    "( asca ) , and the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has further improved such measurements .",
    "@xcite , for example , used _",
    "chandra _ observations to explore the velocity structures in the centaurus cluster ( abell 3526 ) , and they found that significant departures from hydrostatic equilibrium are possible even in a cool cluster that shows little evidence of a strong merger .",
    "icm sloshing motions have also been observed in the central regions of several cool - core clusters ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "there is limited simulation literature addressing interactions between agn outflows and dynamical icm flows , or `` weather . ''",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite carried out 3d simulations of agn outflows into supersonic cross - winds that produced nat - like structures . @xcite",
    "used 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of a low density jet obliquely crossing a plane shock to demonstrate that merger produced shocks can decollimate a jet and cause it to bend . in a study of agn energy deposition to",
    "the icm @xcite and @xcite used output from a cosmological simulation as initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations that included a pair of agn jets . to differentiate behaviors fully from hydrostatic clusters the latter study specifically selected a cluster that was far from being relaxed and that included a net rotation and a dynamically induced cold front .",
    "not surprisingly those authors found significant effects on jet propagation and lobe morphology due to the rather severe icm weather .    especially in the context of clusters exhibiting cavities produced by central dominant galaxies , which more typically associate with apparently more relaxed clusters , however , it is important to understand if such effects can take place in those types of clusters .",
    "except for the @xcite idealized nat study , there are no published simulations of agn interactions with dynamical icms that included magnetic fields . however , since magnetic fields both introduce potential dynamical influences and are also essential to modeling the generation and transport of diagnostic nonthermal emissions , it is important to extend such simulations into the mhd regime .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter oj10 ) recently conducted a series of 3-d mhd simulations of steady and intermittent jets in an analytically defined , magnetized icm close to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the magnetic field was disordered on scales similar to the size of the icm core and on average produced a pressure roughly 1% of the gas pressure , so probably characteristic of cluster strength fields .",
    "they found that for localized regions , those magnetic fields can have a significant effect on the morphology of the jet lobes .",
    "whether this remains true for a dynamically self - consistent cluster evolved through a cosmological simulation has not been examined .",
    "another important result from the oj10 simulations was the lack of any significant deflections of the jets or lobes .",
    "the steady and intermittent jets in their study both maintained relatively straight - line paths , suggesting that a dynamical icm is required to produce bent jet and/or bent lobe morphologies .    to address some of these open issues we present here a pair of 3-d simulations of mhd jets in a dynamic , magnetized icm extracted from a high resolution cosmological simulation .",
    "the selected cluster was chosen from among the more relaxed systems in the simulation . to expand the insights into these interactions and the influence of icm weather on radio lobe morphology the two simulations directed the agn jet pairs in two mutually orthogonal directions that probed distinct regions of the icm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  [ setup ] describes the numerical setup for the calculations ,  [ cluster_cond ] describes the initial conditions in the cluster ,  [ sim_results ] qualitatively describes the results of the simulations ,  [ weather ] discusses the effects of weather on the jets and lobes , and  [ weather_conclusions ] summarizes the major conclusions .",

    "wombat evolved the equations for non - relativistic ideal mhd with adiabatic index , @xmath9 , using the second order , total variation diminishing ( mhdtvd ) method of @xcite .",
    "the solenoidal constraint of the magnetic field was maintained to machine accuracy with the `` constrained transport '' ( ct ) method of @xcite , which solves the induction equation with a directionally unsplit update using emfs derived from the riemann solver .",
    "the simulations included the total energy conserving method for gravity available in wombat and described in detail in @xcite .",

    "the evolution of a passive cosmic ray electron ( cr ) momentum distribution , @xmath11 , was also calculated in the simulations with a restricted form of the `` coarse grained momentum volume '' ( cgmv ) @xcite implementation in wombat .",
    "cgmv solves the diffusion - convection equation for a population of relativistic particles . for these simulations spatial cr diffusion outside shocks was neglected , while adiabatic changes in momentum , test - particle diffusive acceleration at shocks and radiative losses by synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons were included ( see further details below and , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for these simulations were based on a technique used by oj10 . to limit any influence from the boundaries",

    "was derived by extrapolating conditions from the last physical zone .",
    "since the mass distribution was known on a much larger domain ( see below ) , the gravitational potential was known out to radii far beyond the computational domain .",
    "consequently , the exact value for the potential described below was used through the boundaries .",
    "the initial conditions for the simulations described here were extracted from a high resolution simulation of a galaxy cluster performed with an mhd implementation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code gadget-3 @xcite .",
    "the selected cluster is _ g676 _ from @xcite , resimulated at extreme high resolution with mhd enabled ( for details see stasyszyn & dolag , in prep ) . in short , the cluster used for this study",
    "has been extracted from a re - simulation of a lagrangian region selected from a cosmological , lower resolution dm - only simulation @xcite .",
    "this parent simulation has a box  size of @xmath12mpc and assumed a baryon fraction of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the normalization of the power spectrum . using the `` zoomed initial conditions '' ( zic ) technique @xcite , this region was re - simulated with higher mass and force resolution by populating the lagrangian volume with a larger number of particles , while appropriately adding additional high  frequency modes drawn from the same power spectrum . the initial unperturbed particle distribution ( before imprinting the zeldovich displacements )",
    "was realized through a relaxed glass - like configuration @xcite .",
    "gas was then added to the high - resolution regions by splitting each parent particle into a gas and a dm particle .",
    "the gas and the dm particles were displaced by half the original mean inter - particle distance , such that the centre - of - mass and the momentum of the original particle are conserved .",
    "the final mass resolution of the dark matter and gas particles in our simulations is @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "thus , the clusters within its virial radius is resolved with @xmath17 dark matter and a similar number of gas particles . in the simulations ,",
    "the gravitational softening length was chosen to be @xmath18 which correspond roughly to the mean particle separation in the center of the cluster at z=0 .",
    "for the initial magnetic field we choose a space filling , homogeneous , primordial magnetic field of @xmath19 g co - moving as in @xcite .    for this work ,",
    "we were interested in assessing the effects of cluster `` weather '' specifically for a cluster that observationally appears relaxed yet harbors significant bulk icm flows .",
    "we selected the state of _ g676 _ at a redshift of @xmath20 0 , which was the least dynamic period for this cluster .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : cluster_mass ] , the last major merger ( mass ratio of 0.27 ) occurred at @xmath21 0.8 ( a little less than 7 gyr before our jet simulations start ) , and the dark matter mass continued to grow slowly after that .",
    "the general morphology and environment of the cluster at z = 0 can be seen in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "volume averaged values for baryonic density , temperature , velocity , and the magnetic field were all computed from the sph particles and mapped to a uniform grid matching the jet simulation grid .",
    "the simulation assumed a hydrogen fraction of @xmath22 and a helium fraction of @xmath23 , resulting in a mean molecular weight of @xmath24 .",
    "an ideal equation of state was used to convert between pressure and temperature .",
    "radiative cooling of the thermal plasma was not included in the gadget calculations that formed cluster _",
    "g676 _ , so neither was it used in the jet simulations .",
    "a summary of relevant cluster icm properties is given in ",
    "[ cluster_cond ] .        for the jet simulations",
    ", we used a static gravitational potential defined from the total gravitating mass ( dark matter and baryonic matter ) azimuthally averaged from the sph values at the time used for the initial conditions .",
    "figure [ fig : cluster_gravmass ] shows the gravitating mass as a function of radius .",
    "the total enclosed mass out to the virial radius of 1.4 mpc is @xmath25 .",
    "the decision to use a static potential as opposed to evolving a population of dm particles and maintaining an updated full potential was based on simplicity , the relaxed nature of the cluster and the relatively brief duration of the jet activity ( 200 myr ) compared to the dynamical timescale for the cluster mass distribution .",
    "obviously over longer times or in a cluster involved in significant active restructuring it would be important to follow the evolution of the gravitational potential .          for each simulation ,",
    "a pair of oppositely directed jets was launched from a cylinder centered in the grid ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the launching cylinder had a radius of @xmath27 3 kpc and length on each side of the jet origin of @xmath28 = 8 kpc .",
    "an additional 3 kpc thick collar and cap surrounded the cylinder to transition from jet conditions to icm conditions and to contain the return electric current associated with the jet magnetic field (  [ jet_field ] ) .",
    "special consideration was given to how the cylinder interacted with the icm .",
    "in these simulations , ambient flows could in principle enter the cylinder , even from the initial conditions",
    ". this can be particularly problematic if icm magnetic fields enter the cylinder , where they can blend with the jet field and produce undesirable field geometries .",
    "two steps were taken to alleviate this .",
    "first , at the start of the simulation the icm material in the vicinity of the jet cylinder location was gently pushed aside before the jet cylinder was initialized .",
    "in addition , reflecting boundaries were defined as defaults for the cylinder .",
    "the initial icm evacuation was accomplished through a purely solenoidal velocity field imposed at the start of the simulation on a sphere with radius @xmath29 centered on the grid with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 set to the local sound speed .",
    "this sphere was over - pressured by 90% as well .",
    "these conditions were allowed to evolve for 3.28 myr , which was the sound crossing time over @xmath29 .",
    "this removed @xmath32 25% of the icm plasma and magnetic energy from the jet cylinder region .",
    "the jet cylinder was then established at @xmath33 myr . to divorce the icm and jet magnetic fields , any remaining icm field penetrating the jet cylinder or collar",
    "was set to zero at this time .",
    "this last step effectively introduced some magnetic monopoles around the cylinder , but they had negligible effect on the jet flows and were maintained to low levels by the ct scheme in wombat .",
    "the collar region around the active jet cylinder acted as an impenetrable electrically conducting surface because of the imposed reflecting boundaries for both the normal momentum and magnetic field .",
    "this prevented loss of any conserved quantity into the launching region .",
    "the caps of the cylinder transitioned between reflecting boundaries and outflowing jet properties as the jet cylinder transitioned between active and inactive states .",
    "an important feature of the jet cylinder for this investigation was that it could be oriented in any direction on the grid .",
    "this allowed jets to be launched at an arbitrary angle with respect to the large scale flows and pressure structures in the icm . to achieve this , we defined all vector quantities in the jet cylinder according to cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the jet cylinder is azimuthally symmetric , so only two coordinates are needed , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath34 is along the cylinder symmetry axis and @xmath35 is radially outward . by default",
    "the jet @xmath34 axis was aligned with the grid @xmath36 axis , and euler angles were used to reorient the cylinder . after the rotation , all cylinder coordinates were converted into grid coordinates so that quantities could be mapped to the cartesian grid .",
    "the specific orientations of the two jets in this study are discussed in section [ sim_results ] .",
    "the active jet density and pressure were set to @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( approximately 1/200 the initial local icm density ) and in approximate pressure equilibrium with the initial surrounding icm .",
    "for the assumed adiabatic index of @xmath9 , this gave a sound speed inside the jet of @xmath39 km s@xmath3 or 0.03c .",
    "a passively advected  color \" ( or mass fraction ) tracer , @xmath40 , was also introduced in the jet cylinder that was used to identify agn and icm plasma .",
    "the color was set to 1 in the jet cylinder , while all icm material was initially assigned @xmath41 .",
    "when it was active the jet velocity in the jet cylinder was given a spatial ramp from its origin in @xmath34 to allow a smooth transition between the oppositely directed flows of the two jets .",
    "in particular , the velocity had the form , @xmath42 , where @xmath43^{2}\\right ) .",

    "the velocity in the jet cylinder was defined with this ramp to be @xmath44 , where @xmath45 km s@xmath3 , when the jet was fully on ( see  [ jet_evolve ] ) .",
    "this yields a pair of supersonic emergent jets with the flow at mach number , @xmath46 , with respect to the jet sound speed .",
    "the peak speed of @xmath47 corresponds to a lorentz factor of 1.0008 and is sufficiently low that a non - relativistic mhd solver is applicable .",
    "the jet velocity was uniform in @xmath35 across the jet core ( @xmath48 ) , with a transition to the ambient medium velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the core luminosity of each of the two jets , ignoring small contributions from magnetic energy , is given by @xmath50 where @xmath9 .",
    "when the jets are fully active , the preceding parameters give a total luminosity ( including both jets ) of @xmath51 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the transitional collar region adds roughly another 50% to the actual jet luminosity .",
    "the ratio of kinetic energy flux to enthalpy flux for these jets was @xmath52 = 0.48 .",
    "the actual total energy injected onto the grid by the jet cylinder in these runs was @xmath53 erg .    for later discussion",
    "it is also useful to know the thrust of the jets , @xmath54 .",
    "the thrust is easily computed from the luminosity ( with @xmath9 ) as @xmath55 so that the individual core jet thrusts at peak luminosity are @xmath56 dyne .",
    "the magnetic field in the jet launching cylinder was derived with a method that maintained @xmath57 to machine accuracy .",
    "the jet field was purely toroidal inside the jet cylinder with @xmath58 when @xmath59 , where @xmath60 7.92 @xmath61 g ( plasma @xmath62 = 100 ) .",
    "outside of that radius , the field dropped off as @xmath63 and was zero outside of the jet cylinder collar .",
    "this kept the jet field separated from the icm field and made the net electric current in each jet zero .",
    "the arbitrary orientation of the jet cylinder was an additional complication for defining the jet field .",
    "we implemented this by defining an electric field that determined the rate of change of the magnetic field in the cylinder according to faraday s law , @xmath64 . solving this equation allowed magnetic field to be replaced as it was advected out of a zone at an arbitrary angle .",

    "the average length is then about 250 kpc , which over the approximately 200 myr life of the agn activity , corresponds to an average extension rate ( @xmath153 ) around 2500 km s@xmath3 ( approximately mach 5 ) .",

    "such regions serve as a reminder that even for the `` high-@xmath135 '' plasmas modeled here , maxwell stresses can significantly effect the evolution of a plasma and emphasize the importance of modeling these systems with mhd . *",
    "synthetic x - ray observations of these simulations show complex cavity structures associated with the intermittent jets and icm motions .",
    "multiple cavity pairs were `` observed '' as restarted jets pushed into cavities formed by previous outbursts . in one example given , a new cavity forming inside a larger cavity did not have an obvious companion cavity from the opposing jet .",
    "bright rims were seen outlining the cavities , and they were associated with the injection of energy by restarting jets .",
    "additionally , cavities were seen misaligned with the jet launching region due to the deflection of the jets by icm flows . * synthetic radio observations made during periods of jet activity resembled `` double - double '' radio galaxy sources with a bright pair of jets interior to fainter sources further out in the cluster .",
    "this state was temporary , however , as the cosmic ray electrons from the new outburst would eventually reach the end of the outer lobe .",
    "the icm motions created a wat morphology of the lobes in one simulation .",

    "<S> we present a pair of 3-d magnetohydrodynamical simulations of intermittent jets from a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in a galaxy cluster extracted from a high resolution cosmological simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the selected cluster was chosen as an apparently relatively relaxed system , not having undergone a major merger in almost 7 gyr . despite this characterization and history , the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) </S>",
    "<S> contains quite active `` weather '' . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effects of this icm weather on the morphological evolution of the agn jets and lobes . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of the jets is different in the two simulations so that they probe different aspects of the icm structure and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even for this cluster that can be characterized as relaxed by an observational standard , the large - scale , bulk icm motions can significantly distort the jets and lobes . </S>",
    "<S> synthetic x - ray observations of the simulations show that the jets produce complex cavity systems , while synthetic radio observations reveal bending of the jets and lobes similar to wide - angle tail ( wat ) radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> the jets are cycled on and off with a 26 myr period using a 50% duty cycle . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to morphological features similar to those in `` double - double '' radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> while the jet and icm magnetic fields are generally too weak in the simulations to play a major role in the dynamics , maxwell stresses can still become locally significant . </S>"
