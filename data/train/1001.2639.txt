    "recently , we proposed @xcite and generalized @xcite the stochastic point process models generating a variety of monofractal and multifractal time series exhibiting power laws of the spectrum @xmath0 and of the distribution @xmath1 of the signal intensity and applied them for the analysis of the financial systems @xcite .",
