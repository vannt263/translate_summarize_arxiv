    "many models of neuronal computation involve the interaction of a population of excitatory neurons whose outputs drive inhibitory neuron(s ) , which in turn provide global negative feedback to the excitatory pool @xcite",
    ". practical implementation of such circuits in biological neural circuits depend on co - localization of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons , an assumption which studies of the extents of axonal and dendritic trees of neurons in the neocortex show is not valid @xcite .",
    "firstly , a substantial fraction of the axonal arborization of a typical excitatory spiny pyramidal neuron extends well beyond the range of the arborization of a typical smooth inhibitory neuron , particularly in the populous superficial layers of the neocortex @xcite .",
    "this spatial arrangement means that excitatory effects can propagate well outside the range of the negative feedback provided by a single inhibitory neuron .",
    "secondly , the horizontally disposed basket type of inhibitory neuron , which is a prime candidate for performing normalization , makes multiple synaptic contacts with its excitatory targets , so that even within the range of its axonal arborization , not all the members of an excitatory population can be covered by its effect .",
    "this connection pattern means that excitatory neurons within some local population must either be partitioned functionally , or multiple smooth cells must co - operate to cover the entire population of excitatory cells .    in previous publications we have shown how winner - take - all ( wta ) circuits composed of a small population of excitatory neurons and a single inhibitory neuron can be combined to construct super - circuits that exhibit finite state - machine ( fsm ) like behavior @xcite .",
    "the super - circuits made use of sparse excitatory cross - connections between wta modules to express the required states of the fsm .",
    "these excitatory connections can extend well outside of the range of the local wta connections , and so are consistent with the observed long - range lateral excitatory connections referred to above .",
    "on the other hand , we have not previously confronted the question of whether the wta is necessarily localized to the extent of the smooth - cell arborization , or whether the wta can itself be well distributed in space within or between cortical lamina , or even between cortical areas . in this paper",
    "we describe a simple modification to the wta circuit design that couples the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons through synchronization , and so permits a wta to be widely distributed in cortical space , well beyond the range of the axonal arborization of any single inhibitory neuron , and even across cortical areas .",
    "we also demonstrate that such a distributed wta is inherently stable in its operation .",

    "[ fig : allcircuits]b ) .",
    "the key insight is the following : under normal operating conditions , all the participating distributed inhibitory neurons should receive the same summed excitatory input .",
    "we achieve this by interposing an excitatory neuron in the negative feedback loop from the excitatory population to its local inhibitory neuron . instead of the local inhibitory neuron summing over its excitatory population",
    ", the interposed neuron performs the summing and passes its result to the inhibitory neuron . this result",
    "is also copied to the more distant inhibitory neurons in the spatially distributed wta . in this way the inhibitory neuron of each sub - wta sums over the projections from the interposed excitatory neurons of all other sub - wtas , including its own one .",
    "thus , each inhibitory neuron is able to provide feedback inhibition to its local sub - wta that is proportional to the total excitation provided by all excitatory neurons participating in the entire distributed wta .",
    "we will show that functionally this amounts to a form of synchrony between all the inhibitory units .    , inhibitory unit @xmath2 , and intermediate excitatory unit @xmath3 that carries the average activity of @xmath4 .",

    "however , similar reasoning could be applied to all the variants shown .",
    "note that our chosen circuit is similar to that of fig [ fig : allcircuits]b , but has a more realistic connectivity pattern in that the summed excitatory activity is only projected onto a single unit , which requires less wiring specificity than fig [ fig : allcircuits]b .",

    "we exploit this property by inserting dummy terms @xmath36 , which can either be @xmath34 or @xmath35 according to the derivative of @xmath21 : @xmath37 . in this case , all units are active and thus @xmath38 .",
    "a system with jacobian @xmath39 is contracting if @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant transformation into an appropriate metric and @xmath42 is the generalized jacobian . if @xmath43 is negative definite , the system is said to be contracting .",
    "we have shown previous @xcite ( section 2.4 ) how to choose the constant transformation @xmath41 and conditions that guarantee contraction for a wta circuit where all excitatory units provide direct input to the inhibitory unit ( fig [ fig : allcircuits]a ) . in summary , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined based on the eigendecomposition @xmath46 . in this case",
    "@xmath47    guarantee contraction for any such wta of any size @xcite .    structurally , the two versions of the wta are equivalent in that an additional unit was added in the pathway of recurrent inhibition , but no inhibition is added or removed ( compare fig [ fig : allcircuits]a to fig [ fig : elegantcircuit]a ) .",
    "thus , we can apply the same constraints by replacing the product @xmath48 with @xmath49 in above equations .",

    "this in turn shows that the two wtas have merged into a single wta since the definition of a wta is that each excitatory unit receives an equivalent amount of inhibition ( during convergence but not necessarily afterwards , see simulations ) .",
    "this is our second key result .",
    "the final step of the stability analysis are conditions for the coupling strength @xmath69 such that the coupled system as shown in fig [ fig : elegantcircuit]c is contracting . the reasoning in this section assumes that the individual subsystems are contracting ( as shown above ) .",

    "it thus follows that the coupled systems are stable if @xmath88 .",
    "the contraction rate @xcite of an individual subsystem is the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of the hermitian part of @xmath43 ( also see eq ( [ eq : tw2 ] ) ) .",
    "it is @xmath89 for our system .",
    "thus the condition for the two coupled systems to be contracting reduces to @xmath90      in summary , the following conditions guarantee stability of both the single and combined system as well as hard competition between the two coupled systems ( that is , only one of the wtas can have a winner ) .",
    "these conditions can be relaxed if @xmath91 , which will permit a soft winner - take - all .",
    "@xmath92    the lower bound on @xmath5 is from the synchronization analysis , whereas the upper bound is from the stability analysis .",
    "these results illustrate the critical tradeoff between having enough strength to ensure functionality , while being weak enough to exclude instability .",
    "how quickly will a system select a winner ? for a single wta , this question is answered by how quickly a single system contracts toward a winner and for a coupled system how quickly the two systems synchronize .",
    "one of the key advantages of contraction analysis is that the rate of contraction , and in this case the rate of synchronization , can be calculated explicitly .",
    "we will express the contraction and synchronization rate in terms of the time constants @xmath93 and its inverse , the decay constant .",
    "@xmath93 refers to the mean lifetime of exponential decay @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is the decay constant .",
    "both the contraction and the synchronization rate are expressed in the form of a decay constant @xmath86 .",
    "for example , the contraction rate of a system of the form @xmath96 is equivalent to @xmath86 .",
    "physiologically , the time constants @xmath93 in our system are experimentally determined membrane time constants that are typically in the range of 10 - 50ms @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that all excitatory and inhibitory units have the same , but different , time constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . while the exact values depend on the cell type and state of the neurons , it is generally the case that @xmath99 due to the smaller cell bodies of inhibitory neurons @xcite .",
    "the bounds ( [ eq : allbounds ] ) were calculated assuming equal time constants for all units . however , the same calculations yield to very similar bounds when assuming different time constants for inhibitory and excitatory units ( appendix c , @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the ratio of the time constants @xmath100 becomes an additional parameter for the parameter bounds .",
    "the synchronization rate is equivalent to the contraction rate of the system defined in eq [ eq : syncinhib2 ] @xcite , which is the absolute value of the maximal eigenvalue of the hermitian part of @xmath101 . here",

    "the resulting synchronization rate ( sync rate ) is a function of the weights @xmath108 ( local inhibitory loop ) and @xmath5 ( remote inhibitory loop ) .",
    "we assume @xmath109 , which means that remote connectivity is weaker than local connectivity .",
    "however , qualitatively similar results can be found using the opposite assumption . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the sync rate is    @xmath111    note the tradeoff between local and remote connectivity : stronger remote connectivity increases and stronger local connectivity decreases the speed of synchronization ( the larger @xmath86 , the quicker the system synchronizes ) . for approximately equal connectivity strength @xmath112 or in general for @xmath113 ,",
    "the sync rate is approximately @xmath102 .    in general for @xmath114 ,",
    "the sync rate is @xmath115 .",
    "for example , for @xmath116 this reduces to @xmath117 . again , for @xmath112 , the sync rate is approximately @xmath118 . in conclusion ,",
    "the sync rate is thus approximately equal to the contraction rate of the inhibitory units .",
    "thus , synchronization occurs very quickly ( 20 - 50ms for typical membrane time constants ) .",
    "the speed of selecting a winner ( the contraction rate ) for a single wta can similarly be calculated based on the absolute value of the maximal eigenvalue of the hermitian part of @xmath119 ( [ eq : tw2 ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath120 , the contraction rate is    @xmath121    note that the larger @xmath122 , the longer it takes till the system converges . qualitatively similar findings result for other ratios of @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for a typical value of @xmath123 ( see simulations below ) and @xmath124",
    ", the contraction rate would be @xmath125 .",
    "this equals a half - way time ( time constant ) of @xmath126 . for @xmath127 , this would increase to @xmath128 .",
    "the time it takes to find a winner is thus a multiple of the membrane time constant ( in this example @xmath129 ) and substantially slower than the time it takes to synchronize the network . in conclusion",
    ", synchronization is achieved first which is then followed by winner selection .",
    "so far we have shown how two different wtas compete with each other after their inhibitory neurons are coupled . similarly",
    ", more than two wtas can compete with each other by all - to - all coupling of the inhibitory units , i.e. every wta is connected with two @xmath5 connections from and to every other wta .",
    "thus , the wiring complexity of this system scales as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the number of wtas in the system ( note that @xmath131 is not the number of units but the number of wtas ) .",
    "notice also that the all - to - all coupling concerns only the sparse long - range excitatory connections and not the internal connectivity of the wtas them - self .    the same principle can be used to embed hierarchies or sequences of competition .",
    "thus , in a network of such wtas , some wtas could be in direct competition with each other while others are not .",
    "thus , for example , in a network of three wtas a , b , and c relationships such as a competes with b and b competes with c are possible . in this case",
    "a does not directly compete with c. so if a has a winner , c can also have a winner .",
    "if b has a winner , however , neither b nor c can have a winner ( see fig [ fig : sim2]d - f for a demonstration ) .",
    "regardless of how many wtas are combined and whether all compete with all or more selectively , the stability of the aggregated system is guaranteed if the individual sub - systems are stable and the coupling strengths @xmath5 observe the derived bounds . while in themselves combinations of stable modules have no reason to be stable , certain combinations ( such as the one we utilize ) of contracting systems are guaranteed to be stable @xcite .",
    "this is a key benefit of contraction analysis for the analysis of neural circuits .",
    "is slightly delayed for plotting purposes .",
    "( d ) activity of the two interconnect units .",
    "notice how the output of the losing wta @xmath132 descends to zero after the competition has been resolved and the network has contracted .",

    "notice that the same color indicates the same unit throughout this figure ( notation is shown in a ) .",
    ", width=566 ]    we simulated several cases of the network to illustrate its qualitative behavior .",
    "we used euler integration with @xmath133 .",
    "the analytically derived bounds offer a wide range of parameters for which stability as well as function is guaranteed . for the simulations , we chose parameters that verify all bounds discussed .",
    "first , we explored a simple system consisting of two wtas with two possible winners each ( fig [ fig : sim1 ] ) .",
    "parameters were @xmath134 and @xmath50 .",
    "we found that any of the four possible winners can compete with each other irrespective of whether they reside on the first or second wta ( fig [ fig : sim1]b - d shows an example ) .",
    "the inhibitory units quickly synchronized ( fig [ fig : sim1]c ) their activity and reached the same steady - state amplitude ( because @xmath135 ) , it can be verified that @xmath136 for all @xmath137 if the initial values at @xmath138 are equal .",
    "thus , the two inhibitory neurons become exactly equivalent in this special case . ] .",
    "second , we simulated a system with 3 wtas using the same parameters ( fig [ fig : sim2 ] ) .",
    "for all - to - all coupling , all 3 wtas directly compete with each other ( fig [ fig : sim2]a , b ) , i.e. there can only be one winner across the entire system .",
    "again , the inhibitory units all synchronize quickly during and after convergence ( fig [ fig : sim2]c ) .",
    "we also simulated the same system with more selective connectivity , eliminating competition between wtas 1 and 3 ( fig [ fig : sim2]d ) .",
    "this arrangement allows either one winner if it is on wta 2 , or two winners if they are on wtas 1 and 3 .",
    "if the maximal activity is not on wta 2 , then the network permits 2 winning states .",
    "otherwise , if the maximal input is on wta 2 only 1 winner is permitted ( see fig [ fig : sim2]e for an illustration ) .",

    "neural circuits commonly depend on negative feedback loops .",
    "such recurrent inhibition is a crucial element of microcircuits from a wide range of species and brain structures @xcite and enables populations of neurons to compute non - linear operations such as competition , decision making , gain control , filtering , and normalization .",
    "however , when considering biologically realistic versions of such circuits additional factors such as wiring length , specificity and complexity become pertinent . here , we are principally concerned with the superficial layers of neocortex where the average distance of intracortical inhibitory connections is typically much shorter than the excitatory connections @xcite . in contrast , in invertebrates an inhibitory neuron has been identified that receives input from and projects back to all kenyon cells ( which are excitatory ) @xcite .",
    "this neuron has been demonstrated to perform response normalization , making this system a direct experimental demonstration of competition through shared inhibition .",
    "no such system has yet been identified in the cortex .",
    "the number of excitatory neurons that can be contacted by an inhibitory neuron thus poses a limit on how many excitatory neurons can compete directly with one another ( in terms of numbers and distance ) .",
    "other models , such as those based on mexican - hat type inhibitory surrounds @xcite , even require that inhibitory connectivity be longer range than the excitatory .",
    "these anatomical constraints have been used to argue that models such as the wta are biologically unrealistic and as such of limited use .",
    "we have demonstrated here , by theoretical analysis and simulation , that it is possible to extend such circuits by merging several independent circuits functionally , through synchronization of their inhibitory interneurons .",
    "this extension allows the construction of large , spatially distributed circuits that are composed of small pools of excitatory units that share an inhibitory neuron .",
    "we have applied and proved by non - linear contraction analysis that systems combined in this manner are inherently stable and that arbitrary aggregation by inhibitory synchrony of such sub - systems results in a stable system .",
    "this composition of subcircuits removes the limits on maximal circuit size imposed by anatomical wiring constraints on inhibitory connectivity , because the synchrony between local inhibitory neurons is achieved entirely by excitatory connectivity which can possibly be long - range so permitting competition between excitatory units that are separated by long distances ; for example , in different cortical areas .",
    "we show that the time necessary to achieve sychronization is much shorter than the time required to select a winner .",
    "thus , synchronization is faster than winner selection , which can thus proceed robustly across long - range connections that enforce synchronization .",
    "further , selective synchronization between some wtas but not others allows partial competition between some but not other wtas ( see fig [ fig : sim2 ] ) .",
    "the strength of these long - range connections could be modulated dynamically to enable / disable various competitions between two populations conditional on some other brain state .",
    "this modulation could be implemented by a state - dependent routing mechanism @xcite .",
    "there are several possibilities of mapping the abstract units in our model to real physiological neurons .",
    "our units are mean - rate approximations of a small group of neurons . in terms of intra - cortical inhibition",
    ", these would lie anatomically close to each other within superficial layers of neocortex . since",
    "such inhibitory connectivity would have only limited reach , each inhibitory subunit can only enforce competition across a limited number of closeby excitatory units .",
    "competition between different areas is made possible by synchronizing remote populations by long - range excitatory mechanisms in the way we propose .",
    "direct long - range inhibition , on the other hand , is unlikely both intracortically and subcortically , since all known connections from the thalamus and basal ganglia to cortex are excitatory .",
    "networks such as the legion network @xcite assume global inhibitory input to all excitatory units in the network , which for the reasons we discuss is unlikely in the case of cortex .",
    "it would , however , be possible to implement a feasible version of the global inhibitory input by synchronizing many local inhibitory neurons using the mechanism we describe , resulting in an anatomically realistic version of the legion network .",
    "functionally , the model presented here makes several testable predictions .",
    "consider a sensory area with clearly defined features as possible winners , such as orientations .",
    "the model predicts that the inhibitory units would not be tuned to these features , particularly if the number of possible winners is large .",
    "this is because the connectivity to the inhibitory units is not feature specific .",
    "experimental studies indicate that this is indeed the case : units that functionally represent different tuning project to the same inhibitory unit , resulting in untuned inhibitory activity @xcite .",
    "secondly , this model predicts that inhibitory activity between two different areas or parts of the same area can either be highly synchronous or completely decoupled depending on whether at present the two are competing or functioning independently .",
    "this thus predicts that synchrony of inhibitory units should be affected by manipulations that manipulate competition , such as top - down attention .",
    "our model suggests that synchronized populations of inhibitory neurons are crucial for enforcing competition across several subpopulations of excitatory neurons .",
    "it further suggests that the larger the number and spatial distribution of such synchronized inhibitory units , the larger the number of units that compete with each other .",
    "experimentally , synchronized modulation of inhibitory neurons is a common phenomena that is believed to generate the prominent gamma rhythm triggered by sensory stimulation in many areas @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have utilized stimulation of inhibitory neurons @xcite to increase or decrease their synchronization with direct observable effects on nearby excitatory neurons such as , for example , increased or decreased amplitude and precision of evoked responses relative to how strongly the inhibitory neurons were synchronizing .",
    "note that our proposal for this function of inhibitory synchrony is distinct and independent from the proposal that gamma - band synchrony serves to increase readout efficacy by making spikes arrive co - incidentally from a large number of distributed sources @xcite . here , we propose that an additional function of such synchrony is to allow select populations of excitatory neurons to compete with each other because they each receive inhibition at the same time .",

    "we have previously published the detailed methods of applying contraction theory to wta circuits @xcite .",

    "<S> models of cortical neuronal circuits commonly depend on inhibitory feedback to control gain , provide signal normalization , and to selectively amplify signals using winner - take - all ( wta ) dynamics . </S>",

    "<S> however , quantitative neuroanatomical studies of the dimensions of axonal and dendritic trees of neurons in the neocortex show that this co - localization assumption is not valid . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe a simple modification to the wta circuit design that permits the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons to be coupled through synchronization , and so allows a single wta to be distributed widely in cortical space , well beyond the arborization of any single inhibitory neuron , and even across different cortical areas . </S>",
    "<S> we prove by non - linear contraction analysis , and demonstrate by simulation that distributed wta sub - systems combined by such inhibitory synchrony are inherently stable . </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically that synchronization is substantially faster than winner selection . </S>",
    "<S> this circuit mechanism allows networks of independent wtas to fully or partially compete with other . </S>"
