    "according to the principle of emergence , the rich properties and the many different forms of materials originate from the different ways in which the atoms are ordered in the materials .",
    "landau symmetry - breaking theory provides a general understanding of those different orders and resulting rich states of matter.@xcite it points out that different orders really correspond to different symmetries in the organizations of the constituent atoms . as a material changes from one order to another order ( i.e. , as the material undergoes a phase transition )",
    ", what happens is that the symmetry of the organization of the atoms changes .    for a long time",
    ", we believed that landau symmetry - breaking theory describes all possible orders in materials , and all possible ( continuous ) phase transitions .",
    "however , in last twenty years , it has become more and more clear that landau symmetry - breaking theory does not describe all possible orders . after the discovery of high @xmath0 superconductors in 1986,@xcite some theorists believed that quantum spin liquids play a key role in understanding high @xmath0 superconductors@xcite and started to introduce various spin liquids.@xcite despite the success of landau symmetry - breaking theory in describing all kinds of states , the theory can not explain and does not even allow the existence of spin liquids .",
    "this leads many theorists to doubt the very existence of spin liquids . in 1987 , in an attempt to explain high temperature superconductivity , an infrared stable spin liquid ",
    "chiral spin state was discovered,@xcite which was shown to be perturbatively stable and exist as quantum phase of matter ( at least in a large @xmath1 limit ) .",
    "at first , not believing landau symmetry - breaking theory fails to describe spin liquids , people still wanted to use symmetry - breaking to describe the chiral spin state .",
    "they identified the chiral spin state as a state that breaks the time reversal and parity symmetries , but not the spin rotation symmetry.@xcite however , it was quickly realized that there are many different chiral spin states that have exactly the same symmetry , so symmetry alone is not enough to characterize different chiral spin states .",
    "this means that the chiral spin states contain a new kind of order that is beyond symmetry description.@xcite this new kind of order was named@xcite topological order .",
    "the key to identify ( and define ) new orders is to identify new universal properties that are beyond the local order parameters and long - range correlations used in the landau symmetry breaking theory . indeed ,",
    "new quantum numbers , such as ground state degeneracy@xcite , the non - abelian berry s phase of degenerate ground states@xcite and edge excitations@xcite , were introduced to characterize ( and define ) the different topological orders in chiral spin states .",
    "recently , it was shown that topological orders can also be characterized by topological entanglement entropy.@xcite more importantly , those quantities were shown to be universal ( robust against any local perturbation of the hamiltonian ) for chiral spin states.@xcite the existence of those universal properties establishes the existence of topological order in chiral spin states .",
    "near the end of 1980 s , the existence of chiral spin states as a theoretical possibility , as well as their many amazing properties , such as fractional statistics,@xcite spin - charge separation,@xcite chiral gapless edge excitations,@xcite were established reliably , at least in the large @xmath1-limit introduced in .",
    "even non - abelian chiral spin states can be established reliably in the large @xmath1-limit.@xcite however , it took about 10 years to establish the existence of a chiral spin state reliably without using large @xmath1-limit ( based on an exactly soluble model on honeycomb lattice).@xcite    soon after the introduction of chiral spin states , experiments indicated that high - temperature superconductors do not break the time reversal and parity symmetries .",
    "so chiral spin states do not describe high - temperature superconductors .",
    "thus the theory of topological order became a theory with no experimental realization .",
    "however , the similarity between chiral spin states and fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states allows one to use the theory of topological order to describe different fqh states.@xcite just like chiral spin states , different fqh states all have the same symmetry and are beyond the landau symmetry - breaking description . also like chiral spin states ,",
    "fqh states have ground state degeneracies@xcite that depend on the topology of the space.@xcite those ground state degeneracies are shown to be robust against any perturbations .",
    "thus , the different orders in different quantum hall states can be described by topological orders , and the topological order does have experimental realizations .    the topology dependent ground state degeneracy , that signal the presence of topological order , is an amazing phenomenon . in fqh states ,",
    "the correlation of any local operators are short ranged .",
    "this seems to imply that fqh states are `` short sighted '' and they can not know the topology of space which is a global and long - distance property .",
    "however , the fact that ground state degeneracy does depend on the topology of space implies that fqh states are not `` short sighted '' and they do find a way to know the global and long - distance structure of space .",
    "so , despite the short - range correlations of any local operators , the fqh states must contain certain hidden long - range correlation .",
    "but what is this hidden long - range correlation ?",
    "this will be one of the main topic of this paper .",
    "since high @xmath0 superconductors do not break the time reversal and parity symmetries , nor any other lattice symmetries , some people concentrated on finding spin liquids that respect all those symmetries and hoping one of those symmetric spin liquids hold the key to understand high @xmath0 superconductors . between 1987 and 1992 , many symmetric spin liquids were introduced and studied.@xcite the excitations in some of constructed spin liquids have a finite energy gap , while in others there is no energy gap .",
    "those symmetric spin liquids do not break any symmetry and , by definition , are beyond landau symmetry - breaking description .    by construction",
    ", topological order only describes the organization of particles or spins in a gapped quantum state .",
    "so the theory of topological order only applies to gapped spin liquids .",
    "indeed , we find that the gapped spin liquids do contain nontrivial topological orders@xcite ( as signified by their topology dependent and robust ground state degeneracies ) and are described by topological quantum field theory ( such as @xmath2 gauge theory ) at low energies .",
    "one of the simplest topologically ordered spin liquids is the @xmath2 spin liquid which was first introduced in 1991.@xcite the existence of @xmath2 spin liquid as a theoretical possibility , as well as its many amazing properties , such as spin - charge separation,@xcite fractional mutual statistics,@xcite topologically protected ground state degeneracy,@xcite were established reliably ( at least in the large @xmath1-limit introduced in ) .",
    "later , kitaev introduced the famous toric code model which establishes the existence of the @xmath2 spin liquid reliably without using large @xmath1-limit.@xcite the topologically protected degeneracy of the @xmath2 spin liquid was used to perform fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "the study of high @xmath0 superconductors also leads to many gapless spin liquids . the stability and the existence of those gapless spin liquid were in more doubts than their gapped counterparts .",
    "but careful analysis in certain large @xmath1 limit do suggest that stable gapless spin liquids can exist.@xcite if we do believe in the existence of gapless spin liquids , then the next question is how to describe the orders ( the organizations of spins ) in those gapless spin liquids .",
    "if gapped quantum state can contain new type of orders that are beyond landau s symmetry breaking description , it is natural to expect that gapless quantum states can also contain new type of orders . but how to show the existence of new orders in gapless states ?",
    "just like topological order , the key to identify new orders is to identify new universal properties that are beyond landau symmetry description . clearly we can no longer use the ground state degeneracy to establish the existence of new orders in gapless states . to show the existence of new orders in gapless states , a new universal quantity  projective symmetry group ( psg ) ",
    "was introduced.@xcite it was argued that ( some ) psgs are robust against any local perturbations of the hamiltonian that do not change the symmetry of the hamiltonian.@xcite so through psg , we establish the existence of new orders even in gapless states .",
    "the new orders are called quantum order to indicate that the new orders are related to patterns of quantum entanglement in the many - body ground state.@xcite",
    "what is missed in landau theory so that it fails to describe those new orders ?",
    "what is the new feature in the organization of particles / spins so that the resulting order can not be described by symmetry ?    to answer those questions , let us consider a simple quantum system which can be described with landau theory  the transverse field ising model in two dimensions : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the pauli matrices on site @xmath7 . in @xmath8 limit , the ground state of the system is an equal - weight superposition of all possible spin - up and spin - down states : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 label a particular spin - up ( @xmath11 ) and spin - down ( @xmath12 ) configuration . in the @xmath13 limit , the system has two degenerate ground states @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the transverse field ising model has a @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the ground state @xmath17 respect such a symmetry while the ground state @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) break the symmetry .",
    "thus the small @xmath20 ground state @xmath17 and the small @xmath21 ground state @xmath18 describe different phases since they have different symmetries .",
    "we note that @xmath18 is the exact ground state of the transverse field ising model with @xmath22 .",
    "the state has no quantum entanglement since @xmath18 is a direct product of local states : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an up - spin state at site @xmath7 .",
    "the state @xmath17 is the exact ground state of the transverse field ising model with @xmath25 .",
    "it is also a state with no quantum entanglement : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a state with spin in @xmath28-direction at site @xmath7 .",
    "we see that the states ( or phases ) described by landau symmetry breaking theory has no quantum entanglement at least in the @xmath25 or @xmath22 limits . in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 limits , the two ground states of the two limits still represent two phases with different symmetries",
    ". however , in this case , the ground states are not unentangled . on the other hand",
    "since the ground states in the @xmath25 or @xmath22 limits have finite energy gaps and short - range correlations , a small @xmath20 or a small @xmath21 can only modify the states locally .",
    "thus we expect the ground states have only short - range entanglement .",
    "the above example , if generalized to other symmetry breaking states , suggests the following conjecture : _ _ if a gapped quantum ground state is described by landau symmetry breaking theory , then it has short - range quantum entanglement . _ _    the direct - product states and short - range entangled states only represent a small subset of all possible quantum many - body states .",
    "thus , according to the point of view of the above conjecture , we see that what is missed by landau symmetry breaking theory is long - range quantum entanglement .",
    "it is this long - range quantum entanglement that makes a state to have nontrivial topological / quantum order .",
    "however , mathematically speaking , the above conjecture is a null statement since the meaning of short - range quantum entanglement is not defined . in the following",
    ", we will try to find a more precise description ( or definition ) of short - range and long - range quantum entanglement .",
    "we will start with a careful discussion of quantum phases and quantum phase transitions .",

    "the ground state average of a local operator @xmath33 of the system , @xmath34 , naturally also depend on @xmath31 .",

    "thus the two states @xmath36 and @xmath38 belong to the same phase .",
    "this completes our argument that states related by a local unitary evolution belong to the same phase .",

    ", we see that a state with a short - range entanglement also has a trivial topological order .",
    "this leads us to conclude that a non - trivial topological order is related to long - range entanglement .",
    "since two gapped states related by a lu evolution belong to the same phase , thus two gapped states related by a local unitary evolution have the same topological order .",

    "the green shading represents a causal structure . ]",
    "the lu evolutions introduced here is closely related to _ quantum circuits with finite depth_. to define quantum circuits ,",
    "let us introduce piece - wise local unitary operators .",
    "a piece - wise local unitary operator has a form @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a set of unitary operators that act on non overlapping regions .",
    "the size of each region is less than some finite number @xmath85 .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath86 defined in this way is called a piece - wise local unitary operator with range @xmath85 . a quantum circuit with depth @xmath87 is given by the product of @xmath87 piece - wise local unitary operators ( see fig . [ qc ] ) : @xmath88 . in quantum information theory ,",
    "it is known that finite time unitary evolution with local hamiltonian ( lu evolution defined before ) can be simulated with constant depth quantum circuit and vice - verse .",
    "therefore , the equivalence relation can be equivalently stated in terms of constant depth quantum circuits : @xmath89 where @xmath87 is a constant independent of system size .",
    "because of their equivalence , we will use the term `` local unitary transformation '' to refer to both local unitary evolution and constant depth quantum circuit in general .",

    "it can be easily generalized to study topological orders and quantum phases with symmetries ( see section [ symtop]).@xcite the quantum circuit has a more clear and simple causal structure .",
    "however , the quantum circuit approach breaks the translation symmetry .",

    "in fact , people have been using quantum circuits to classify many - body quantum states which correspond to quantum phases of matter . in",
    ", the local unitary transformations described by quantum circuits was used to define a renormalization group transformations for states and establish an equivalence relation in which states are equivalent if they are connected by a local unitary transformation .",

    "note that the time reversal invariant topological orders are equivalent class of local orthogonal transformations that connect to the identity transformation continuously .",
    "different real solutions @xmath358 of the fixed - point conditions do not always correspond to different time reversal invariant topological orders .",
    "the solutions differ by some unimportant phase factors ( which are @xmath359 signs ) correspond to the same topological order .    to understand the above result",
    ", we notice that , from the structure of the fixed - point conditions , if @xmath279 is a solution , then @xmath360 is also a solution , where @xmath361 , @xmath362 , and @xmath363 .",
    "however , the three phase factors @xmath364 , @xmath365 , and @xmath366 do not lead to different fixed - point wave functions , since they only affect the total phase of the wave function and are unphysical .",
    "on the other hand , the fixed - point solutions may also contain phase factors that do correspond to different fixed - point wave functions .",
    "for example , the local orthogonal transformation @xmath367 does not affect the fusion rule @xmath137 , where @xmath287 is the number of links with @xmath288-state and @xmath289-state .",
    "such a local orthogonal transformation changes @xmath279 and generates a discrete family of the fixed - point wave functions .",
    "similarly , we can consider the following local orthogonal transformation @xmath368 that acts on each vertex with states @xmath292 on the three edges connecting to the vertex .",
    "such a local orthogonal transformation also does not affect the fusion rule @xmath137 . the new local orthogonal transformation changes @xmath279 and generates a family of the fixed - point wave functions parameterized by the orthogonal matrix @xmath369 .",
    "now the question is that do those solutions related by local orthogonal transformations have the same time reversal invariant topological order or not .",
    "we know that two gapped wave functions have the same time reversal invariant topological order if and only if they can be connected by local orthogonal transformation that _ connects to identity continuously_. it is well known that an orthogonal matrix whose determinant is @xmath370 does not connect to identity .",
    "thus it appears that local orthogonal transformations some times can generate different time reversal invariant topological orders .",
    "however , when we use the equivalent classes of local orthogonal transformations to define time reversal invariant topological orders , we not only assume the local orthogonal transformations to connect to identity continuously , we also assume that we can expand the local hilbert spaces ( say by increasing the range of the indices @xmath115 and @xmath150 that label the states on the edges and the vertices ) .",
    "the local orthogonal transformations can act on those enlarged hilbert spaces and can connect to identity in those enlarged hilbert spaces . even when a local orthogonal transformation can not be deformed into identity in the original hilbert space , it can always be deformed into identity continuously in an enlarged hilbert space .",
    "thus two real wave functions related by a local orthogonal transformation always have the same time reversal invariant topological order .",
    "for example , an orthogonal matrix @xmath371 that acts on states @xmath295 and @xmath296 does not connect to identity within the space of two by two orthogonal matrices . however , we can embed the above orthogonal matrix into a three by three orthogonal matrix that acts on @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath372 : @xmath373 .",
    "such a three by three orthogonal matrix does connect to identity within the space of three by three orthogonal matrices .",
    "this completes our argument that all local orthogonal transformations can connect to identity continuously at least in an enlarged hilbert space .",
    "so , after factoring out the unimportant phase factors discussed above , the real solutions of the fixed - point conditions may uniquely correspond to time reversal invariant topological orders .",
    "the four types of real solutions discussed in the last section are examples of four different time reversal invariant topological orders .    for the @xmath294 loop states and the @xmath294 string - net state",
    ", we only have two states on each link . in this case",
    ", we can treat the two states as the two states of an electron spin .",
    "the time reversal transformation now becomes @xmath374 on each link .",
    "for such a time reversal transformation @xmath375 .",
    "the two @xmath294 loop states and the @xmath294 string - net state are not invariant under such an time - reversal transformation .",
    "once the fixed - point states have been identified and the labeling of topological orders has being found , we then face the next important issue : given a generic ground state wave function of a system , how to identify the topological orders in the state ?",
    "in other words , how to calculate the data @xmath376 that characterize the topological orders from a generic wave function ?    one way to address the above issue is to have a general renormalization procedure which flows other states in the same phase to the simple fixed - point state so that we can identify topological order from the resulting fixed - point state .",
    "that is , we want to find a local unitary transformation which removes local entanglement and gets rid of unnecessary degrees of freedom from the state . how to find the appropriate unitary transformation for a specific state is then the central problem in this renormalization procedure .",
    "such a procedure for one dimensional tensor product states(tps ) ( also called matrix product states ) has been given in .",
    "here we will propose a method to renormalize two dimensional tps , where nontrivial topological orders emerge .",
    "the basic idea is to use the glu transformation discussed in section [ wvrg ] .",
    "note that , through the glu transformation , we can reduce the number of labels in a region a to the minimal value without loosing any quantum information ( see fig .",
    "[ glut ] ) .",
    "this is because the glu transformation is a lossless projection into the support space of the state in the region a. by performing such glu transformations on _ overlapping _ regions repeatedly ( see fig .",
    "[ qc]a ) , we can reduce a generic wave function to the simple fixed - point form discussed above .",
    "it should be noted that any state reducible in this way can be represented as a mera @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will present this renormalization procedure for two dimensional tps where we find a method to calculate the proper glu transformations .",
    "the tensor product states are many - body entangled quantum states described with local tensors . by making use of the entanglement information contained in the local tensors",
    ", we are able to come up with an efficient algorithm to renormalize two dimensional tps .    this algorithm can be very useful in the study of quantum phases .",
    "due to the efficiency in representation , tps has found wide application as variational ansatz states in the studies of quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "suppose that in a variational study we have found a set of tensors which describe the ground state of a two dimensional many - body hamiltonian and want to determine the phase this state belongs to .",
    "we can apply our renormalization algorithm to this tensor product state , which removes local entanglement and flows the state to its fixed point . by identifying the kind of order present in the fixed - point state , we can obtain the phase information for the original state .    in this section",
    ", we will give a detailed description of the algorithm and in the next section we will present its application to some simple ( but nontrivial ) cases .",

    "we can use the equivalent classes of local unitary transformations to define `` patterns of long range entanglement '' .",
    "so the patterns of long range entanglement correspond to universality classes of quantum phases , and are the essence of topological orders.@xcite    as an application of this point of view of quantum phases and topological order , we use the generalized local unitary transformations to generate a wave function renormalization , where the wave functions flow within the same universality class of a quantum phase ( or the same equivalent class of the local unitary transformations ) .",
    "in other words , the renormalization flow of a wave function does not change its topological order .",
    "such a wave function renormalization allows us to classify topological orders , by classifying the fixed - point wave functions and the associated fixed - point local unitary transformations .",

    "we like to point out that we can not claim that the solutions @xmath505 classify all topological orders since we have assumed that the fixed - point local unitary transformations are described by tensors of finite dimensions .",
    "it appears that chiral topological orders , such as quantum hall states , are described by tensors of infinite dimensions .",
    "we note that the data @xmath504 just characterize different fixed - point wave functions .",
    "it is not guaranteed that the different data will represent different topological orders . however , for the simple solutions discussed in this paper , they all coincide with string - net states , where the topological properties , such as the ground state degeneracy , number of quasiparticle types , the quasiparticle statistics _ etc _ , were calculated from the data . from those topological properties , we know that those different simple solutions represent different topological orders .",
    "also @xmath506 are real for the simple solutions discussed here .",
    "thus they also represent topological orders with time reversal symmetry .",
    "( certainly , at the same time , they represent stable topological orders even without time reversal symmetry . )",
    "we also like to point out that our description of fixed - point local unitary transformations is very similar to the description of string - net states . however , the conditions , , , and on the data appear to be weaker than ( or equivalent to ) those@xcite on the string - net data .",
    "so the fixed - point wave functions discussed in this paper may include all the string - net states ( in 2d ) .",
    "last , we present a wave function renormalization scheme , based on the glu transformations for generic tps .",
    "such a wave function renormalization always flows within the same phase ( or within the same equivalence class of lu transformations ) .",
    "it allows us to determine which phase a generic tps belongs to by studying the resulting fixed - point wave functions .",
    "we demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for both symmetry breaking phases and topological ordered phases .",
    "we find that we can even use tensors that do not break symmetry to describe spontaneous symmetry breaking states : if a state described by a symmetric tensor has a spontaneous symmetry breaking , the symmetric tensor will flow to a fixed - point tensor that has a form of direct sum .",
