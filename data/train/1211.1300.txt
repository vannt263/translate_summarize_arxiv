    "the flux density scale most commonly used at centimeter wavelengths is based on the spectral flux densities listed in @xcite for the four strong radio sources cassiopeia a , cygnus a , taurus a , and virgo a. the data utilized in that paper were taken by many radio telescopes , mostly in total power .",
    "the measured spectral flux densities of these four sources were termed by @xcite as ` absolute ' , meaning the telescopes utilized had accurately known gains and the observations were calibrated with a suitable thermodynamic standard .",
    "the @xcite paper provides convenient polynomial expressions for the spectral flux densities for these four sources , valid between 30 mhz and 30 ghz , with an accuracy estimated at about 5% .",
    "however , because all four of these primary flux density sources have angular sizes of several arcminutes , none is suitable as a calibrator for modern high resolution interferometers .    to provide a more widely distributed network of potential calibrators , @xcite also included polynomial expressions  generally valid from 400 mhz to 15 ghz , for 13 smaller diameter ` secondary ' sources whose flux densities were determined by measuring their ratios to virgo a. of these 13 sources , three  3c48 , 3c147 , and 3c286 , are very compact , and have been extensively untilized by the vla , and other interferometers , for calibration .",
    "early observations taken by the vla at 4885 and 1465 mhz suggested that the ratios of the flux densities of 3c48 , 3c147 , and 3c286 deviated , at the level of a few percent , from ratios derived using the @xcite expressions .",
    "as some , or all of these sources were known to be variable , a program was started in 1983 to measure the ratios of the flux densities of a set of small - diameter sources , including six of the @xcite secondary sources , at a range of frequencies accessible to the vla .",
    "the goals were to correct , where necessary , the @xcite expressions for the adopted calibrators ( relative to one or more of them selected as the standard ) , and to track any temporal variations of their flux densities . as even the smallest of these secondary sources",
    "are significantly resolved to the vla in its highest resolution configurations , most observations in this program were conducted while in the most compact configuration , with maximum spacing of @xmath01 km . this program ",
    "modifed and expanded as noted below  has continued since 1983 .",
    "the majority of scientific observations taken in the 1980s were at the 6-cm and 20-cm receiver bands .",
    "beginning in the later 1980s , and extending into the 1990s , significant improvements in vla capabilities were implemented as new receiver bands were added , three of the initial four receiver bands were improved , and the technique of referenced pointing was implemented , enabling much more precise high frequency observations .",
    "these changes required new calibration objects to be added to this program , and a new flux density reference source , valid for high frequencies , to be used , since the @xcite expressions are valid only to 15 ghz .",
    "we will make frequent references in this paper to the vla s receiver bands , and to particular frequencies chosen for the observations .",
    "the appropriate nomenclature for these bands has long been a matter for debate ",
    "the common use of letter band codes , although convenient from the engineering point of view , is not useful , and often confusing for non - radio astronomers , especially since the same letters are often used by other astronomical instruments for completely different frequency bands . in this paper , we will not utilize these letter codes , except where their compactness is required in tables .",
    "when we are referring to a particular receiver system , we will refer to it as a frequency band , and denominate it by the wavelength of the central frequency of that band .",
    "when we refer to a result which is specific to a chosen frequency , we will denominate it by that frequency .",
    "we show in table  [ tab : nomenclature ] the band names , the frequency tuning ranges for each , and the commonly - used letter code .",

    "single - dish total - power radio telescopes are conceptually simple , but have distinct disadvantages for accurately measuring the flux densities of radio sources , particularly at low frequencies .",
    "their low resolution prevents discrimination against background objects or extended emission located in the primary beam , so the observed power includes unrelated sources whose contributions can only be estimated statistically by observing nearby fields .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for sources embedded in a bright extended background such as the galactic plane .",
    "by contrast , an interferometer functions as a spatial filter , discriminating against smooth backgrounds , while at the same time , with its higher resolution , enabling separation of the target source from the nearby confusing sources .",
    "the relation between the cross - product spectral power , @xmath1 , provided by an interferometer , and the spectral flux density ( or visibility ) @xmath2 of a source is expressed as ( @xcite ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the atmospheric attenuation , @xmath5 is the efficiency of the digital electronics , including the correlator , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the physical area and aperture efficiency , respectively , of antenna @xmath8 .",
    "calibration of the electronics , including variations in the gain , is accomplished by utilizing the value , @xmath9 , measured at the correlator , of a signal of power @xmath10 injected at the receiver .",
    "equation ( 1 ) could be used to directly determine the flux density of a source provided all the factors were known with sufficient accuracy .",
    "but in fact there are significant uncertainties in the determination of some of these :    * correction for system gains , and changes in the gains , requires accurate knowledge of the switched power , @xmath11 .",
    "these values are measured in the lab , but after deployment in the field , the actual values may vary by a few percent , due to variations over time and temperature . furthermore , because the switched power measurement is a true total power measurement , even low levels of radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) can perturb the measurements of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a significant problem for the lower frequency bands . *",
    "the antenna aperture efficiency , @xmath12 , measures the fraction of the total incident source power intercepted by an antenna which is delivered to the receiver .",
    "factors which reduce efficiency include blockage and refraction of the incoming signal by the support legs and subreflector , the illumination taper introduced by the feed , mispointing of the antenna , errors in optical alignment , and distortions of the primary reflector .",
    "in general , the efficiency of the vla s antennas is known with an accuracy of @xmath05% .",
    "the antenna efficiency is a strong function of elevation at the higher frequencies due to gravitationally - induced distortions of the antenna surface and quadrupod support legs . *",
    "the atmospheric absorption term , @xmath4 , has a strong elevation dependency at higher frequencies , and can be time and spatially variable due to clouds .",
    "because of these uncertainties , direct use of eqn.(1 ) to convert the interferometer products to flux density has not been practical for the vla if accuracies better than @xmath010% are desired .",
    "however , provided the system calibration powers are in error by only a constant scale factor , and that the effects of antenna efficiency and atmospheric absorption can be parameterized as time - independent functions of elevation , the vla can be used to determine highly accurate flux density ratios between calibrators . in the following sections",
    ", we demonstrate how ratios with accuracies much better than 1% can be determined at most frequencies , and how these ratios can be used to determine accurate absolute flux densities by using the planet mars as the reference .",
    "the major factors which degrade the vla s ability to accurately measure flux density ratios are changing system gains , errors in antenna pointing , and elevation dependencies of the antenna gain . in this section , we describe how each can be mitigated through careful observing strategies and data post - processing .      to monitor system gains , a small , known amount of noise power is added to the receivers , square - wave modulated at a frequency of 10 hz .",
    "this additional power is synchronously detected and measured at the correlator .",
    "changes in the detected calibration power reflect changes in electronic gains , provided the injected power is itself stable . to demonstrate the effectiveness of this system , we show in figure  [ fig : syslin ] the correlation amplitudes ( visibilities ) for a point source when the gain corrections have , and have not been applied .",
    "these data were taken in clear weather over a 40-hour period at a frequency of 4885 mhz , at which the elevation - dependent antenna gain corrections and atmospheric opacity effects are negligible .    the application of the switched power correction has reduced the apparent flux density variations from @xmath050% to less than 1% .",
    "observations made in the early years of this program clearly indicated that the primary source of error in the gain calibration process at frequencies above @xmath010 ghz is due to offsets in antenna pointing .",
    "the accuracy of blind vla pointing at night under calm conditions is about 10 arcseconds . on sunny days , pointing offsets induced by differential solar heating of the antenna structure can exceed 1 arminute  larger than the fwhm of the vla primary beam at the highest frequency band .    to remove such errors , the method of ` referenced pointing ' was implemented on the vla in the mid-1990s ( @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "a pointing determination is made on a nearby calibrator ( or on the target source itself , if sufficiently compact ) , and the offset correction applied to subsequent observations .",
    "utilization of this technique can reduce pointing error to as low as 3 arcseconds , providing the calibrator object is close enough  ideally within 5 degrees in azimuth and elevation , and preferably less than 15 degrees  and the weather calm and clear .",
    "the offset determination is normally made at a frequency within the 3 cm band , as this has the best combination of sensitivity and resolution , and the results applied to observations made at other frequency bands .",
    "this methodology was first employed in our program in 1995 , and was utilized for all following observations .",
    "the vla antennas lose forward gain at high frequencies from a combination of deformation of the antenna surface and a bending of the quadrupod feed leg structure .",
    "the loss of gain at high frequencies is significant , but is repeatable and can be corrected for with good accuracy , as illustrated by the fits shown in figure  [ fig : elfit ] , taken from 43 ghz observations in october , 2011 .",
    "referenced pointing was applied to these observations ",
    "the scatter about the best - fit gain represents the current limit for vla pointing  approximately four arcseconds , rms .",
    "the source list for the inaugural june 1983 observations comprised the entire @xcite source list , plus the compact source 3c138 which , although known to be variable , is useful for calibration because of its small angular size and high fractional linear polarization . from these , the seven most compact objects were selected for further observations .",
    "these were : 3c48 , 3c123 , 3c138 , 3c147 , 3c286 , 3c295 , and ngc7027 .",
    "these sources were observed in all of the 19 separate observation sessions .    over time",
    ", additional objects were added to the list : 3c196 in 1989 , ngc6572 in 2000 , and mwc349 in 2001 . beginning in 1995 ,",
    "observations of the planets mars , venus , jupiter , uranus , and neptune were added to enable extension of the scale to the highest frequencies utilized by the vla , since the planets are commonly used as millimeter - wavelength flux density standards ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "jupiter was dropped from the list after four sessions , as it is too large for its total flux density to be accurately measured by the vla at the high frequency bands .",
    "we selected the planet mars as the primary high - frequency standard .",
    "mars is an excellent source for this role , as it has a good emission model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is usually free of clouds and dust that can affect cm - wavelength observations , and is usually small enough to be only partially resolved to the vla in its most compact configuration at all frequency bands .",
    "the recent publication of the absolute wmap observations of mars by @xcite has provided the capability of placing the entire cm - wavelength flux density scale on an absolute standard .",
    "not all sources were observed at all frequency bands at all sessions , as the planets are too weak to have been detected at frequencies below @xmath0 5 ghz prior to the vla s upgrade , and 3c123 is too heavily resolved at the highest frequencies . as the vla s sensitivity improved dramatically following the implementation of the widar correlator in march 2010 , subsequent observations included venus , mars , uranus and neptune at all bands except at 90 cm .",
    "the observations were made in 19 observing sessions on the dates listed in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the table also lists the time spent for each session , the configuration in which the observations were made , a summary of the available frequency bands , and a brief note about the weather conditions .",

    "observations after this date added new frequencies , but always retained those listed in the last line of table  [ tab : freqcoverage ] . the 90 cm band observing system was disabled in 2009 , so no observations were possible at this band following the 2008 session . due to the implementation of new receivers ,",
    "no 2 cm band data were taken in the 2010 session .",
    "the general methodology was to observe each source approximately hourly at each band . to prevent holes in coverage , the durations of most sessions were at least 24 hours . given the restrictions in antenna slew rate , source separation , and source elevation , we typically obtained five to ten individual ` snapshot ' observations of each object at each band , with each observation s duration being 30 to 60 seconds .",
    "this methodology permits accurate estimation of and correction for elevation - dependent telescope characteristics , and allows a good estimation of the errors in the flux density .",

    "the visibility integration time was kept short , typically 3.3 seconds or less .",
    "all editing , calibration , imaging , and image analysis were done within the aips software package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same editing and calibration methodology was employed for every source at each band for every session , to maximize uniformity and reliability of the results .",
    "the sequence of operations was as follows :    1 .",
    "* initial editing : * most sources are strong enough to allow a simple initial editing to purge obviously invalid data  typically showing up as abnormally low amplitudes . on occasion , rfi or solar interference was seen , with the affected data removed in the same way .",
    "* estimation of atmospheric opacity : * for the observations made between 1995 and 2007 , antenna dips were done every six hours at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm bands to permit estimation of atmospheric opacity ( @xcite ) .",
    "these values , or the values from an atmospheric model using surface and seasonal weather data for the years where no dip data were available ( @xcite ) , were applied to the visibility data .",
    "* removal of atmospheric and instrumental phase perturbations : * phase fluctuations were removed by application of phase self - calibration for each source , using a point - source model for the unresolved sources , or a ` clean - component ' model for resolved sources . in the latter case , the model was derived from the data , using an imaging / self - calibration loop . for both",
    ", the phase solutions were determined for each time integration , and the results applied to the corresponding visibility data .",
    "the snr for the low - frequency planetary observations was generally too low to permit this procedure",
    " however , at these frequencies , the phase stability was always good enough that such detailed phase fluctuation removal was not necessary .",
    "* removal of data taken with bad pointing : * the most difficult error to detect  and the error which ultimately limits the accuracy of high frequency observing  was that due to residual pointing errors .",
    "we did this by first making an amplitude calibration solution for each source , using either a point - source model , or a ` clean - component ' model .",
    "we then examined these solutions , flagging those data for which the corresponding power gains deviated by more than a fixed fraction , varying from 1% for the low frequency bands to 25% for the highest frequency band . in nearly all cases ,",
    "the flagging is on data whose amplitudes are too low ",
    "consistent with the cause being pointing offsets . to prevent bias",
    ", all sources at any one band were flagged with the same threshold .",
    "we emphasize that these amplitude gain solutions were never applied to the data  they were utilized only to identify bad data .",
    "estimation and removal of elevation gain dependency : * the elevation gain dependency was estimated by jointly fitting the calibration gain solutions for the source flux densities and an antenna - based elevation dependency of the form : @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting gain function was then applied to all the visibility data . for all but the last two sessions ,",
    "the objects utilized were the four sources which are nearly unresolved at all frequencies in our observations  3c48 , 3c138 , 3c147 , and 3c286 .",
    "for the final two sessions , approximately 30 additional point - sources were added to the source list and were included in this calibration step .",
    "separation of the elevation gain dependency from individual pointing offsets required two or three interations of this and the previous step .",
    "final gain calibration : * after all discrepant data were removed , and the elevation dependency measured and corrected for , a final amplitude calibration solution was made using a single source , either 3c147 or 3c286 .",
    "the average gain from these solutions was then applied , without any temporal trend , to all sources in the dataset . because the primary data products from these observations are the flux density ratios between the sources , the value of the flux density assigned to this source is not important .",
    "the only rationale for this final step is one of convenience  to put the source visibilities on a scale close to the correct one .",
    "we made no effort to remove any temporal changes in the amplitude gains , except in the final observing session , which included an additional 30 point sources .",
    "these were added for the purpose of investigating the vla s gain stability over wide ambient temperature changes .",
    "a very small effect was observed at some frequencies , and removed with a 6-hour smoothing window .      for each source at each session and frequency , the flux density  on the arbitrary scale as noted above  and",
    "a likely error were determined with the following procedure  utilized for both unresolved and resolved objects .",
    "* the source flux density was determined from an image utilizing all the data for one session .",
    "the image provides two estimates , one from the sum of the clean components , the other from integration over the reconstructed brightness of the source . for sources which were unresolved or marginally resolved , a third estimate from a fit to a 2-d gaussian profile to the image",
    "was made . in all cases",
    ", these estimates agreed to within the image noise errors .",
    "* for the four planets , an additional estimation was made from fitting the complex visibility to an appropriate limb - darkened disk model ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of this estimate to that from the image total flux showed excellent agreement to within the parameter errors generated by the fit . * an estimate of the error in the derived mean flux density was made from the dispersion of the @xmath14 individual ` snapshot ' observations of each source at each band . for each snapshot observation , an estimate of the flux density was made by summing the clean components generated by the deconvolution .",
    "the dispersion , @xmath15 , was determined from these @xmath14 estimates , and the error estimate of the mean , @xmath16 , was then determined from @xmath17 .",
    "this method for determining the measurement error is valid provided the errors in the @xmath14 observations are statistically independent .",
    "we believe this is the case , since the primary source of error in the flux determination at the higher frequencies is from residual pointing errors , which change over a timescale of an hour or less .",
    "furthermore , any residual errors in the elevation gain dependency correction are likely due to variable atmospheric opacities , which we expect are also variable on time - scales of an hour or less .",
    "since the observations of any individual source are typically separated by an hour or more , we can consider each observation independent of the others .    at low frequencies ( 90 , 20 , and 10 cm bands ) ,",
    "the errors are dominated by residuals in the deconvolution procedure since the background sources are never perfectly removed , and by errors in the corrections for gain variations .",
    "again , we believe that the characteristic timescale for changes in these errors is typically one hour or less , so that the individual observations are expected to have independent errors .",
    "the primary data products of this program are the flux density ratios between all of the sources .",
    "these were determined utilizing the flux densities derived as described above .",
    "the errors of these ratios were determined using standard propagation of error methodology , assuming the errors in the flux density of one source are independent of those for the others .",
    "we seek a set of strong , compact , and non - varying objects which can serve as general purpose absolute flux density calibrators .",
    "this was done by examining the changes in the ratios of the flux densities of our ten non - planetary target objects over the duration of this project .",
    "since it is extremely unlikely that variability in any one object is correlated over both time and frequency with variability with any other , a constant ratio between two sources over the duration of this project is a strong indicator that both are constant in time .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of being independent of the flux density scale imposed by the calibration procedure described above .",
    "this analysis was done at the frequencies shown in table  [ tab : freqcoverage ] at which our observations spanned the longest period of time : 327.5 , 1275 , 1465 , 4535 , 4885 , 8435 , 8735 , 14965 , 22460 , and 43340 mhz . for some of the sessions , where a particular frequency was not utilized , such as in 1995 and 1998 , when 1475 mhz was tuned instead of 1465 mhz , the two frequencies actually tuned within that same band were used , and the desired value derived by a linear interpolation .",
    "this examination showed that the four sources 3c123 , 3c196 , 3c286 , and 3c295 , showed negligible changes in their flux density ratios over the duration of this project , and hence should serve as good absolute flux density sources .",
    "plots of the ratios of three of these sources over time are shown in fig  [ fig : steady286 ] .",
    "the error bars are 1-@xmath15 probable errors derived from the estimated errors in the individual flux densities .",
    "the red lines are from a weighted linear regression fit .",

    "radio emission from uranus is entirely from the atmosphere , as the sensible surface is too deep in the planet .",
    "the flux density of uranus at centimeter wavelengths has been described in @xcite and at millimeter wavelengths by @xcite ( and references therein for both ) .",
    "importantly , there is an enhancement of emission from both poles , and so viewing geometry changes the flux density significantly .",
    "given the @xmath080 year orbital period of the planet , along with its unusual pole position relative to the ecliptic , variations on roughly decadal timescales are expected , and are clearly detected ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the expected flux density reached a minimum at the autumnal equinox in 2007 , since the extent of the polar enhancements was minimized then , and we see this reflected in the measured flux densities .",
    "there is still some uncertainty as to whether these polar enhancements extend to millimeter wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "uranus is a suitable absolute calibrator at higher frequencies ( above a few ghz , depending on the sensitivity of the telescope ) , up to the 50 ghz upper - limit of this study , as long as these geometry considerations are taken into account    neptune is similar to uranus in that its emission is entirely from the atmosphere .",
    "the differences are in the lack of geometry changes for neptune ( though there is also a south polar emission enhancement for neptune , its sub - earth latitude does not change appreciably over even decadal timescales ) , and differences in atmospheric composition ( @xcite ) .",
    "neptune is a suitable absolute calibrator at the frequencies of this study as long as the sensitivity of the telescope is sufficient , though long - term studies of its emission are not as complete as for uranus .",
    "detailed comparisons of our observed brightness temperatures with those predicted by various models are in preparation .",
    "we expect that these comparisons will result in improvements to the models of characteristics of the surfaces and atmospheres of these planets which will increase our understanding of them .",
    "one of the original purposes of this campaign was to determine the accuracy of the @xcite scale .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : marsbaars ] , where we give the ratio at six frequencies for the five sources 3c48 , 3c123 , 3c147 , 3c286 , and 3c295 between our mars - based fluxes and the corresponding @xcite expressions .",
    "as three of the sources are shown here to be slightly variable , we have for these objects utilized the average flux densities over the measurement period . note that although the @xcite scale for these sources is not defined above 15 ghz , we have applied their expressions to the higher frequency bands so users can conveniently estimate any flux density scale errors introduced by the use of these sources outside the recommended frequency range .",
    "unsurprisingly , the deviations become quite large at these higher frequencies for most of these sources .",

    "the ratio of our values to those of @xcite are 0.97 , 1.03 , and 0.94 , for the three sources .",

    "the vla , when used with care , is capable of measuring the flux density ratios between compact , bright , and isolated radio sources with an accuracy much better than 1% at most frequency bands .",
    "we have utilized this capability to measure the ratios between a set of proposed calibration sources , covering the entire frequency range from 1 through 50 ghz .",
    "the observations span more than 30 years at some frequencies .",
    "the set of observed sources included seven compact extragalactic sources , two galactic planetary nebulae , one evolved star , and four planets .",
    "the vla can not make accurate absolute measurements of the spectral flux density of radio sources .",
    "we converted our accurate ratio measurements to spectral flux densities by utilizing a thermophysical emission model of the planet mars .",
    "the model was placed on an absolute scale by utilizing the wmap observations of mars , which are calibrated on the cmb dipole anisotropy .",
    "> from the nine compact , non - planetary objects , we determine that four sources  3c123 , 3c196 , 3c286 , and 3c295 are stable to within 1% over the 30-year span of this program at all frequencies except above @xmath0 40 ghz , where our accuracy is limited by antenna pointing .",
    "we present polynomial expressions for the spectral flux density of these four sources . of these , 3c286 is the most compact with the flattest spectrum , on which basis we have selected it as our interferometric standard flux density calibrator . using its derived spectrum , we determine the spectral flux densities of all the other sources over the frequency range of 1 to 50 ghz .",
    "the three sources 3c48 , 3c138 , and 3c147 are commonly used flux density calibrators for the vla and other interferometers .",
    "however , all are variable on timescales of several years .",
    "we have fitted polynomial expressions to their spectral flux densities as a function of time , to allow past users of the vla to correct their calibration .",
    "the planets venus , uranus , and neptune are all potential calibration sources at high radio frequencies . using our new scale ,",
    "we have derived their mean brightness temperatures , to assist in improving models of their atmospheric emission .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the new scale is estimated at @xmath02% , with the largest source of error being the transfer of the wmap observations to the vla radio observations .",
    "the errors in the internal transfer from the derived spectral flux density of 3c286 to other sources is estimated at less than @xmath01% for all frequencies below @xmath020 ghz , and rises to @xmath03% at the highest vla frequency of 50 ghz .",
    "we emphasize that this very low error does not mean that all observations with the vla have this accuracy .",
    "the actual accuracy obtained for any observation will , in addition to the estimated accuracy of the flux density scale , be determined by how the observation is set up , the observing conditions , and the care taken in the calibration and imaging steps .",
    "the authors thank eric greisen for the many improvements made to the ` aips ` data reduction software package over the years of the project , particularly those needed in response to the dramatic increase in the vla s capability with the implementation of the widar correlator .",
