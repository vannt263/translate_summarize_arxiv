    "radioactive nuclear beam facilities and gamma ray detectors have in recent years allowed one to study spectroscopy of the low - lying excited states for exotic nuclei .",
    "it provides rich information about the nuclear structure , including evolution of shell structure and collectivity , nuclear shape and quantum phase transition  @xcite , decoupling of neutrons and protons  @xcite .",
    "presently , much interest is focused on the measurement of the energies of the first @xmath1 , or @xmath2 states and of the reduced transition probabilities ( @xmath3-values ) from the first @xmath1 to the ground state ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these are fundamental quantities which can be used to disclose the nuclear shapes and shell structure .",
    "a high energy of the first excited @xmath1 state and a corresponding low @xmath5 electromagnetic transition strength , are characteristic signatures of shell closures and vice versa . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the two - neutron separation energy as a function of proton number for different isotones .",
    "large gaps are found between two neighbor isotones with neutron number around @xmath6 , etc . in additional , one notices that the gaps , for instance with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are decreasing when one goes to neutron - rich regions .",
    "the evolution information of shell structure is reflected in nuclear low - lying states , for example , the first @xmath1 excitation energy as shown in the lower part of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is seen clearly that the @xmath9s in @xmath10 mg and @xmath0ne are much lower than those in other @xmath7 isotones , indicating the erosion of magic number @xmath7 .",
    "similar situation has been shown in @xmath11 isotones as well .",
    "therefore , the study of low - lying states provides us an important way to examine the shell structure in exotic nuclei and becomes one of the major research fields of the nuclear structure community .",
    "an alternative approach to the large scale shell model calculations for nuclear low - lying states is the new beyond mean field theories  @xcite . in recent years several accurate and efficient models and algorithms",
    "have been developed that perform the restoration of symmetries broken by the static nuclear mean field and take into account fluctuations around the mean - field minimum .",
    "the most effective approach to configuration mixing calculations is the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) . with the simplifying assumption of axial symmetry , gcm configuration mixing of one - dimensional angular - momentum projected ( 1damp ) and even particle - number projected ( pnp ) quadrupole - deformed mean - field states , has become a standard tool in nuclear structure studies with skyrme energy density functionals  @xcite , the density - dependent gogny force  @xcite , and relativistic density functionals  @xcite . a variety of structure phenomena has been analyzed using this approach , such as , the structure of low - spin deformed and superdeformed collective states  @xcite , shape coexistence in kr and pb isotopes  @xcite , shell closures in the neutron - rich ca , ti and cr isotopes  @xcite and shape transition in nd isotopes  @xcite .",
    "recently , the 1damp+gcm framework has been extended to include triaxial shapes , which makes it possible to study the nuclear low - lying states with the consideration of effects from restoration of rotation symmetry in full euler space and shape fluctuation in @xmath12-@xmath13 plane .",
    "along this direction , the 3damp+gcm models with pnp have been developed , based on the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach with skyrme forces  @xcite and the gogny force  @xcite . in these models , seven degrees of freedom ( three euler angles + two deformation parameters + two gauge angles for protons and neutrons ) should be considered , which makes the calculations very time - consuming . therefore , only illustrative calculations have been done with these models . in the mean time , the 3damp+gcm model on top of the relativistic mean - field has also been developed  @xcite . in the relativistic 3damp+gcm model , the prescription given in refs .",
    "@xcite has been used to restore approximately the correct mean values of the nucleon numbers by adding constraint terms for nucleon numbers to the transition energy functional .    in this report",
    ", the recently developed relativistic 3damp+gcm model will be outlined and its applications to the low - lying states of @xmath0 mg will be presented .",
    "the effects of triaxiality on the low - energy spectra and transitions will be examined .",
    "in the relativistic 3damp+gcm model , we first perform the triaxial relativistic point - coupling model plus bcs calculations with quadratic constraints on the mass quadrupole moments by minimizing the following energy functional @xmath14 = e[\\rho_i , j^\\mu_i ] + \\sum_{\\mu=0,2 } \\dfrac{c_\\mu}{2}(\\langle\\hat q_{2\\mu}\\rangle - q_{2\\mu})^2,\\ ] ] that is a functional of four types ( s , v , ts , tv ) of densities and currents .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the expectation value of the mass quadrupole operator , @xmath16 is the triaxial deformation parameter , and @xmath17 is the stiffness constant .",
    "this procedure generates a large set of highly correlated intrinsic deformed states @xmath18 .",
    "there are successful non - linear versions , pc - f1@xcite , pc - pk1@xcite and density - dependent version , dd - pc1@xcite of relativistic energy functionals that can be used in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "the pairing correlations , for open - shell nuclei , are taken into account by augmenting the following pairing energy functional , @xmath19=-\\sum_{\\tau}\\int d\\mathbf{r } \\dfrac{v_\\tau}{4 } \\kappa^\\ast_\\tau(\\mathbf{r } ) \\kappa_\\tau(\\mathbf{r})\\ ] ] with separately adjustable pairing strengths @xmath20 for protons and neutrons . the anomalous density",
    "( pairing tensor ) @xmath21 is determined by the occupation probability coefficient @xmath22 and density @xmath23 of single - particle state , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an energy - dependent smooth cutoff factor used to simulate the effects of finite - range .",
    "alternatively , one can use a separable pairing force  @xcite in the pairing channel .",
    "the results of low - lying states with the separable pairing force will be given elsewhere .",
    "the nuclear wave function @xmath26 with good angular momentum and shape fluctuation is obtained by projecting the intrinsic states @xmath27 onto good angular momentum ( k - mixing ) and performing gcm calculations ( configuration mixing ) , @xmath28\\vert\\phi(\\beta,\\gamma)\\rangle\\ ] ] the weight functions @xmath29 are determined from the solution of hill - wheeler - griffin ( hwg ) integral equation @xmath30",
    "f^{jk^\\prime}_\\alpha(q^\\prime)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the angular - momentum projected gcm kernel matrices of the hamiltonian and the norm , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 is the abbreviation of triaxial deformation parameters @xmath34 .",
    "the electromagnetic moments and transition strengths of low - lying states are evaluated with the nuclear wave function @xmath35 .",
    "more details about the relativistic 3damp+gcm model can be found in refs .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the self - consistent rmf+bcs triaxial quadrupole energy surface and angular - momentum - projected energy surface with @xmath36 from the 3damp+gcm calculations with the effective interaction pc - f1 .",
    "it is seen that there is an evident near - spherical minimum in mean - field energy surface of @xmath0 mg . however , this minimum shifts to a relative large deformed shape with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the dynamic correlation energy from the restoration of rotational symmetry is about 2.7 mev .",
    "the projected energy surface becomes soft in both @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions around the minimum , indicating the existence of large shape fluctuations .",
    "this phenomenon can be seen from the probability distribution of ground state in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    to examine the effects of triaxiality on the low - energy spectra and transitions , we present the spectroscopic results from both 1d- ( frozen @xmath39 ) and 3d - amp+gcm calculations in table 1 , where the results of 1damp+gcm calculations with the non - relativistic gogny force and corresponding experimental data  @xcite are given for comparison .",
    "it shows that the inclusion of triaxiality in the 3damp+gcm calculations with the pc - f1 brings the results of @xmath40 and @xmath41 transition strength @xmath42 more closer to the data .",
    "in conclusion , the recently developed relativistic 3damp+gcm model has been outlined and its applications to the low - lying states of @xmath0 mg has been presented .",
    "it has been found that @xmath0 mg has large shape fluctuations in both @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions around the triaxially deformed minimum .",
    "the effects of triaxiality on the low - energy spectra and transitions have been shown to be important to reproduce the corresponding experimental data .",
